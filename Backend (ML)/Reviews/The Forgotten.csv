16 June 2004,andrewsk8s,8," About the Title
","I remember liking this movie when it came out, and thinking what an odd and somewhat misleading title (just ask for it at Blockbuster and watch the funny looks they give you). Except for the great and recognizable cast when looking at the box, one would expect a more prurient, less substantive, late-night cable skin flick from a movie so titled. But the title though is appropriate as the movie is about friends, behaving like the ""girls"" of their childhood, sharing laughs, gossiping, and candidly baring their psyches at a bachelorette party. It is interesting, funny, sexy, and even innovative (like, it was a good idea to do an entire film focused on women just conversing candidly -and the viewer is an eavesdropper). Having just seen the newly released DVD version, it occurred to me how reminiscent the dialogue and style is to Sex in the City, which started its run several years after this movie. It is not a great and serious film work, but it is good, interesting, well-made, and may be a good conversation starter.",/review/rw8709983/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2007,guyfromjerzee,7," Funny and original
","I don't have much to say about the film, but I guess that's mainly because I was too engaged throughout most of it to really think about it aesthetically. I always feel that good acting, writing and characters are the three most essential elements to a good film. ""Live Nude Girls"" has all three of those elements. I'm usually not hesitant to watch ""chick flicks."" I'm not saying this so that women reading this comment won't want to slap me in the face. I'm just a film buff in general, and I don't have much of a bias when I watch films. A good movie is a good movie. But during the first 20 minutes or so, even I was thinking, Hmmmm...this might be too much of a chick flick for me. Let's face it, there are certain things that women find amusing that men don't. If some woman made a joke involving a white sale at Bloomingdale's, I probably won't get it. But as the film progressed, I almost fell in love with these characters, and found certain elements that relate to my own situations with my friends. I did find it funny how the writer/director had the female characters talking candidly about sex and getting drunk, while the male characters were just playing pool and engaging in innocent, mundane conversations. I doubt a group of men would really throw such a dull bachelor party with no strippers, but it was funny nonetheless. And like with the show ""Sex and the City"" this film shows that men are not the only ones who can talk on and on about sex. True, we talk and think about it more, but that doesn't mean women don't talk about it at all. Being a heterosexual man, I can't help but admit that I found the copious female nudity and sex scenes between two women pretty damn stimulating. And I've had the hots for Dana Delaney ever since I saw her in ""Exit to Eden."" The film has plenty of funny moments, though there are some broad jokes that seemed a little out of place. Man or woman, you should check this film out. You'll probably be pleasantly surprised.",/review/rw8709983/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2010,MBunge,5," The textbook definition of ""You'll like it if you like this sort of thing"".
","This movie is like a precursor to the HBO series ""Sex and the City"", except it's less cutesy, less melodramatic and not at all obsessed with puns. If you'd like to see what Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte looked and sounded like about a step earlier on the evolutionary scale, you'll find it in Live Nude Girls.",/review/rw8709983/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2002,agro8-1,," The most unfairly overlooked comedy of the 90's
","""Live Nude Girls"" appears to have been the blueprint for 'Sex in the City"".This extremly funny movie was never released in theatres as apparently it was considered to sexually frank for 1995.My how times have changed, with the subsiquent succses of the above mentioned show its high time this brillantly acted,written and directed film got the attention it deserves.Career best performences are put in by most every actress in the film.Discussing the film in detail would rob the viewer of the suprises that help make the film such a treat.I strongly recommend the film to any and all.",/review/rw8709983/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 1999,Rumples,7," Interesting
","Being a male I had often wondered what women think and talk about when they're on their own. I had no idea that it would be so obsessively sexual. In any case, this movie is an interesting examination of the lives and relationships of a bunch of women, each of whom have their own hang-ups and problems, but with a close-knit friendship which binds them together. The title can be somewhat misleading, although there is plenty of nudity involved, as this movie is more about women empowering women than about male exploitation/domination of women. A different slant in the old 'friends get back together for a reunion/wedding/death/whatever and talk/explore their past/renew bonds/whatever' genre. Worth a watch - 7/10.",/review/rw8709983/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2005,dredyoung,10," Ever really observed, as an outsider, a relaxed coffee klatch?
","This movie was exactly like what I have witnessed in real life. It captured the essence of the woman's take on sex in modern America. It was a delight to see it played out so true to life on TV. It portrayed both the angst and delight of women's growing sense of sexual freedom. It also captured classic types and how they differ as they venture onto this new, uncertain ground. Talking more frankly as the tempo from the day through the evening quickens and each confronts and encourages the others to drop their public persona, revelations shock and titillate each in different ways. They also try to temper their tendency to be judgmental and recover and be supportive. As they reveal their idiosyncratic, even kinky, fantasies, the defenses gradually drop. Actual sexual behaviors are revealed. Those more modest and fearful of disapproval relax their defenses when they hear their friends daring escapades. These revelations stimulate recollections and reminiscences of 'first' experiences and youthful sexual foibles. This allows them to become really transparent about their suppressed unconventional longings. Gradual mutual acceptance and support leads to a sense of empowerment to experiment and take a chance of being themselves, insulated from traditional female fear of losing their reputation and becoming stigmatized. A new strength comes from their new bond in womanhood that gives them a new found freedom and courage to own their authentic sexuality.",/review/rw8709983/?ref_=tt_urv

","Six young women sit around at a bachelorette party and drink margaritas and eat pizza. Collectively they're a rainbow of personality types. Let's see. There's the flighty soap opera actress getting by on her good looks. (That would be Kim Cattrall.) Then there's the square who wanted to be a ballerina but turned out to be a bored CPA, Cynthia Stevenson. And there's the hostess, a bisexual chef, Lora Zane.",/review/rw8709983/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2005,Go_Skins,5," Nice title, but not really the plot!
",I thought this movie ways going to be more than it was. It starred Kim Cattrall (Sex and the City) so I thought it had to be somewhat decent. It's basically the story of 5 girl friends that get together for a sleepover and end up discussing sex quite a bit. You see a flash or two of the husbands supposedly at a bachelor party that they're supposed to be at. I guess one of the girls didn't trust the guy and wanted nothing to do with him. I really liked how the characters acted with each other. They each had their own personalities of course. This is one movie that I could say I watched and definitely say I would NOT watch it again because I just didn't care for it. It was labeled a comedy and I don't think I laughed that much at all!,/review/rw8709983/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2001,ladylibrary,," Pretty Funny
","I consider myself very critical of movies, so if I have something good to say, it means something! :)  The title initially put me off.  Here I was thinking it was going to be a senseless comedy about Live Nude Girls (wonder why I thought that!), but it turned out to be a funny view of what happens when girlfriends get together.  I found it to be quite honest!  The best part was when the friends are sharing their dreams, and Cynthis Stevenson's character imagines herself as a Barbie Doll.  That part had me rolling!!!",/review/rw8709983/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2008,jehaccess6,6," Six Women Having A Mid-Life Crisis.
","I bought this DVD because it featured Dana Delaney and Kim Cattrall, both of whom appeared in 'Masquerade'. I knew the film would not be as raunchy as the title would suggest. I suppose that I had a bit of male curiosity about how women act when men are not around. With the film being written and directed by a woman, I expected that the depicted female behavior would reflect reality.",/review/rw8709983/?ref_=tt_urv

2 September 2005,Rogue-18,1," Live Nude Lies
","The tragedy is that some people -- men *and* women -- will watch a movie like this and think that it reflects the truth -- ""how women really feel"", etc. It's utter baloney, and the fact that a woman wrote this garbage is testament to one woman's willingness to write anything in order the appeal to the lowest common denominator and make a buck. Same goes for the performers involved.",/review/rw8709983/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2005,umbriel86,10," decent....
","I liked this movie...whether you are 18 or 80, I think everyone can relate to this story. It is a group of friends that spend the night together before a major life changing event. it shows how they deal with certain situations. The title is misleading but I don't think that this movie should be shot down just because they don't deliver a porn. It's more of a movie for a night in with some of your closest friends. It has many instances that can be seen as points that every friendship goes through. there are secrets that are hidden from some friends that come out in the end and sibling rivalry is also apparent. the character of chris seems out of place at times but in the end she pulls everyone together.",/review/rw8709983/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2003,matusekpres,10," Kim Cattrall always rates a 10!!!
","Some films defy carping criticism.  With a cast such as this film boasts, all 30+ beauties, plot and technique become as irrelevant as Hans Blix.   Kim Cattrall (a certified goddess), Cynthia Stevenson, Dana Delaney, ...etc... -- what a feast for the eyes -- I'd watch them taking turns reading the phone book!",/review/rw8709983/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 1999,Ale/Mfk,," Boring
","Now when I say boring I don't mean it isn't realistic I have no doubt that women do talk this much about sex when there alone but since they all seem so unlikable (with the exception of Olivia D'Abo who plays the  lover of one of the women who reunite in this film), I didn't care about what happened to them.",/review/rw8709983/?ref_=tt_urv

","What an accomplishment for Julianna Lavin and a great cast. This is something very rare. Live Nude Girls is a work of art that balances intelligent, witty, honest story-telling with high intensity eroticism. It is very engaging in a humane, beautiful, funny way while at the same time remaining very very sexy. I have never seen anything that achieved this. Julianna Lavin somehow knew how to weave sexiness with ideas and the result is astonishing.",/review/rw8709983/?ref_=tt_urv
