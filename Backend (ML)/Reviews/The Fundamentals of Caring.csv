26 June 2016,planktonrules,9," This film demonstrates that 'direct to Netflix' is NOT a bad thing at all.
","A few days ago, I watched a horrid film that was produced for Netflix...""The Do-Over"". So, when I saw the latest film to come directly to Netflix, ""The Fundamentals of Caring"", I was very apprehensive about it. Would it be yet another sub-par film or would it show that Netflix can make a product every bit as good as you'd see from larger and more traditional outlets? Fortunately, it a very good film and I am glad I forced myself to watch it.",/review/rw6894110/?ref_=tt_urv

",First let me say that I don't write reviews on IMDb often but after watching this movie and seeing how little reviews it has I had to write one. Just so that if there is any other soul looking here all confused if he/she should watch this movie or not. WATCH IT. JUST GO WATCH IT.,/review/rw6894110/?ref_=tt_urv

","Rarely does a movie snag me hook line and sinker like this one did. I was ready for something shallower and much less impressive, and found myself engrossed, in love with the characters and rooting for them as they navigate their shared journeys of self discovery. The story is surprisingly layered, and the performances natural and nuanced, to the point where I found myself quite emotionally involved. Heatwarming and refreshing - a great feel-good road movie with surprising depth.",/review/rw6894110/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2017,lesleyharris30,8," Subtly Acted and Heartwarming,
","The Fundamentals of Caring is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific cast. It deals with a lot of heavy issues, but manages to handle it in a way that is very tame and is never too much for its audience, such as disabilities and the main character having lost his child. It balances out comedy and drama incredibly well, it has moments that had me snickering, as well as moments that brought a tear to my eye, and I never felt like either was overbearing.

3 March 2021,rphanley,8," Wow.... I wasn't expecting that.
","Great movie! I was really impressed with the cast. Well acted movie with a great story. I wasn't expecting much from Selena Gomez, but she did a great job. One of the best roles I've seen Paul Rudd in! Craig Roberts did an amazing job as well. The chemistry with all of the characters was there and it made you care about them. Great drama/comedy.",/review/rw6894110/?ref_=tt_urv

27 June 2016,FallonTimberlake2016,8," A great movie that should be put up with some of the best road trip films ever.
","The Fundamentals of Caring surprised me for a couple of reasons. First of all, even though they started off great with Beasts of No Nation, Netflix has not made very good movies lately. With two bad Adam Sandler comedies and a mediocre Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon sequel, I started to wonder whether they were going to redeem themselves movie-wise. On top of that, this movie stars Selena Gomez, who hasn't made any good movies despite being relatively easy to look at.",/review/rw6894110/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2016,dmchardy98,8," Surprisingly pleasant and overly warming.
","I never review movies, but this is an exception. I have never been so pleasantly surprised by a movie in such a long time and I really have to commend the cast for doing such a great job. The movie was heartfelt from start to finish and included just the right balance of laughs and tragedy to keep the overall mood upbeat.",/review/rw6894110/?ref_=tt_urv

29 June 2016,ballinkywitzki,10," Very rarely do I get attached to characters like I did in this film
","First of all, I'd like to say that I am a fan of character development. Many good movies aren't great because their characters lack a real sense of attachment. The fundamentals of caring nails it on the head. Paul Rudd is a work of art in this film and quite frankly that surprised me. Selena Gomez pleasantly perfected her role as well which surprised me even more. I am not placing any spoilers but I will tell you that it shouldn't matter what type of movies you typically enjoy, you SHOULD enjoy this one. I am a 23 year old male, and an Army Vet so you would expect a guy like me to be into more manly macho movies. Well you'd be right. But as a fan of art and emotion, I respect movies like this. You will feel a way with the story that brings you everything from joy, laughter, pain, guilt and even fear. Its an emotional roller-coaster ride and I'll be riding it again in the front seat every time. Must watch movie hands down. I'll even say you should subscribe to Netflix even if it's only for one month just to see this movie. This definitely makes its way on my top 10, easily.",/review/rw6894110/?ref_=tt_urv

8 September 2018,abegley-19194,7," Netflix Originals are gonna get better if they keep doing this.
","The Fundamentals of Caring is a good film. I've never seen Paul Rudd in a drama before, but he surely did nail this role. His character is a caretaker for children, and he starts caring for a handicapped boy who shares his thoughts about family. I've never seen a Netflix Original movie, excluding Calibre, that I can actually call: ""worth your time"". Selena Gomez is also in the movie. Although her character is a little aggravating and hard to like, she does fulfill her character arcs and grows from a broken and traumatized person, to a fixed and light-hearted person in the end. This goes for all the characters In the film as well. I also admire how this film is based on a novel, and has no narrator. Films like Ready Player One and The Kissing Booth, have unnecessary narration. The Fundamentals of Caring does not have this though, which makes it more subtle and easier to love. This film is definitely worth the watch and I'm giving it a 7/10.",/review/rw6894110/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2017,zegirl,8," The perfect balance of drama and comedy
","The Fundementals of Caring is a hilarious and heart warming film that shows insight into the fact that you cannot provide proper care for some one with out in turn loving them, as well as the idea that the best way to help yourself is through helping others. I truly enjoyed the mystery of what happened to his son carried through out the film, leaving us to feel the whole gravity of his death hangover is while another child was being born. The parallels of life and death making the moment all the more intense. Altogether this films delicate balance of comedy and drama kept you on your toes, you'd be rolling on the floor one minute and on the brink of tears and just before you'd start to cry you'd be laughing again.",/review/rw6894110/?ref_=tt_urv

29 June 2016,redproton88,10," Absolute Gem and A Must See
","I truly enjoyed this film and really didn't want to see it end. Not sure if this has been mentioned on any of the other reviews or boards, but I thought this film had a similar spirit to The Road Within, another fantastic and quirky road trip film. Some critics complain about the predictability of the film, but I couldn't disagree more. I never felt deceived or played to with clich√©s. There was a definite playfulness that I greatly appreciated. There was great chemistry among all the cast and I would highly recommend a watch. It's uplifting, hopeful, poignant and often at times laugh out loud funny. Based on a novel, the story is about a middle aged man who has suffered incredible losses and becomes a caregiver and gains a new perspective. A true gem and one i could see re-watching with friends and family. I rarely write reviews, but this is one I am more than happy to make the time and spread the word!",/review/rw6894110/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2016,BlueFairyBlog,8," Easy to Care About
","Novels about teenagers disabled or dying have become hugely popular lately. Looking at books like ""The Fault in Our Stars,"" ""The Beginning of Everything,"" and ""Wonder,"" it's clear that the way to engage with teenaged readers is to show differently abled people in a positive light. In that same vein comes this Netflix film, based on the book ""The Revised Fundamentals of Caring,"" by Jonathan Evison.",/review/rw6894110/?ref_=tt_urv

","It is a film you've seen before, but the details are what matters and in this they create a pleasant feelgood road trip. Paul Rudd actually played his role really well, with a depth that you only realize after the film is over. So what is it about? This kid has muscular dystrophy and needs care, so Rudd's character takes the job and then convinces the otherwise recluse kid to go on a drive to see some random sightseeing landmarks he was fantasizing about. On the road they meet some people that they take along and live life fuller, finding themselves.",/review/rw6894110/?ref_=tt_urv
