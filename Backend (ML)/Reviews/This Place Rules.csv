29 November 2017,Hey_Sweden,8," Time just gets away from us.
","Jeff Bridges gets to put his own spin on the character of Reuben ""Rooster"" Cogburn, first portrayed by an Oscar-winning John Wayne in the 1969 film adaptation. Rooster is hired by a very plucky 14 year old girl, Mattie Ross (debuting Hailee Steinfeld), who wants to avenge her father. Dad was murdered by the cowardly Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), who made out for Indian territory and who may now be riding with an outlaw, Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper), and his gang. They are joined by a determined Texas Ranger, LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), who wants to arrest Chaney for a crime committed in the Lone Star state.",/review/rw2390775/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2017,Tweekums,9," A remake that is every bit as good as the original
","After her father is murdered fourteen year old Mattie Ross is determined to bring Tom Chaney, his killer, to justice; to this end she hires US Marshal Rooster Cogburn. Cogburn drinks and has a reputation for shooting the people he is meant to be arresting but Mattie believes he has 'true grit' and is the man for the job. A Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf is also looking for Chaney in regards to a murder in Texas; a murder with a larger reward Mattie however is determined that Chaney will hang for the death of her father not for what he did in Texas. She insists on accompanying Cogburn, something he initially objects to but as they travel deeper into Indian Territory, where Chaney is riding with a group of outlaws. Before catching up with Chaney they come across other members of the gang and reunited with LaBoeuf.",/review/rw2390775/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2010,Loving_Silence,10," One of the most crowd-pleasing films I think the Coens have ever made, accessible, simple, mythic and finally beautiful
","The Coen brothers are known for being one of the best filmmakers of our time. They both compliment each other perfectly. When I heard they were remaking the 1969, John Wayne classic True Grit, I was extremely excited and had incredibly high expectations of the film. Being a major fan of Western movies, I was really interested how it would turn out. I wanted the movie to be more faithful to it's original source material, Charles Portis novel, than the 1969 film had been. I was also hopeful that Jeff Bridges would fill the huge shoes of the classic, legendary John Wayne. I was hoping that they would blend the humor of the original 1969 film with some of the suspense or thrills from earlier Coen brothers films like No Country For Old Men or Fargo. But not become way too violent that it causes to stay completely unrecognizable to Charles Portis classic novel. ",/review/rw2390775/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2010,Monotreme02,8," Good ol' fashioned storytelling
","As is to be expected, the film has all the classic Coen flourishes, first and foremost its use of language. The Coens have always been impeccably tuned in to language and accents, from the most creative use of swear words in The Big Lebowski and Burn After Reading to the colorful, stylized prose of The Hudsucker Proxy and The Man Who Wasn't There to the very distinct accents in Raising Arizona, Fargo, O Brother, Where Art Thou? and No Country for Old Men. In classic Coen fashion, the use of language is very much emphasized in True Grit. The characters have a very distinct use of words, lifted right out of the novel and, as it feels at least, right out of the time period the film takes place in. Unlike something like Deadwood which features a very modernized and stylized version of 18th century speak, the dialogue in True Grit sounds completely authentic and, along with the impeccable and accurate-feeling costume and set design, really adds to the realism of the world True Grit creates. Accents are also very important – the harsh Southern drawl that the Coens have always been attracted to is very prominent and plays a very large role in the film.",/review/rw2390775/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2011,bob the moo,," Simply just a really solid piece of storytelling with good work across the board
","I wasn't sure how to take the news that the Coen brothers were remaking the John Wayne film True Grit and I remained unsure even when it was clear that they were not so much remaking the film as making a different version of the original book. How would their humour and oddity sit in this story, how would their normal arch cynicism and cleverness work here? Well in reality it doesn't really come into play because they have made a film that is surprisingly free of that side of their work while also containing just enough in terms of characters and dialogue to make it their own. Mostly though what True Grit does is deliver an enjoyable story in an engaging and satisfying manner.",/review/rw2390775/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2011,chaos-rampant,," Print the legend..
","Few directors working today in America have mastered form like the Coens, I discover this with every new film they make. True Grit is a commercial film made to please but I don't see a compromise in the making and it's still a distinctly Coen film if you pay notice. Try to take out the Coen character from the film and the film breaks apart, it's that tightly woven in the fabric of it.",/review/rw2390775/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2011,TheLittleSongbird,9," Great, and makes some improvements over the 1969 film
","True Grit isn't really a remake as such, but as a more faithful take on the novel. And even if it were a remake, it is one of the better ones if so. While I did like the 1969 very much, although I didn't like Kim Darby, this version does make some improvements, such as the pace and Mattie. But it also has some hindrances, the ending is abrupt, and some of the characters perhaps are not quite as intriguing as they are in the 1969 film, Rooster especially has a more somewhat cantankerous personality there.",/review/rw2390775/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2010,winner55,8," Get the comparisons out of the way, then give the film its due.
","Let's get the comparisons with Henry Hathaway's version of the Charles Portis novel out of the way. The Coen Brothers certainly knew that, however much they want to 'go back to the source material,' their film would play against Hathaway's version.",/review/rw2390775/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2011,moviemanMA,10," The old west lives again
","True Grit is not a remake, but a re-imagining. Narrated by Mattie Ross, played by Hailee Steinfeld, who makes her feature film debut, we find Mattie picking up the pieces following the death of her father at the hands of Tom Chaney (Brolin). A headstrong girl, Mattie isn't looking for a handout; she's looking for justice. She is directed towards Rooster Cogburn (Bridges), a Federal Marshall whose reputation for shooting his prisoners makes him the right fit for Mattie's cause.",/review/rw2390775/?ref_=tt_urv

",Every so often I just have to rewatch this classic remake. Another masterpiece by the Coen Brothers. The writing is fantastic. The cinematography is excellent. This really could have been a much longer movie and been just as good. Would liked to have seen more of all the characters. Such a great performance here by Bridges. Bridges is really so good when he is given good material to work with and he certainly is here. Damon is good. And the various members of the Barry 'Ned' Pepper gang are fun to watch. What a great film. Tremendous.,/review/rw2390775/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2011,TxMike,," Very enjoyable rendition of the ""True Grit"" story.
","Sadly I am one of the very few movie fans that never got around to seeing the John Wayne movie. But I will now remedy that, it will be in my BD player soon. (Edit: I saw it and to me the 1969 original is a better movie, mostly for John Wayne and, although not authentic, the scenes in the Rocky mountains.)",/review/rw2390775/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2011,Rockwell_Cronenberg,8," Surprisingly un-Hollywood. Unsurprisingly brilliant.
","The least ""Coen"" of all of the Coens films is also one of their finest. It has a few Coen inflections to it (Damon's twang of a voice, a few random mustached characters crossing paths with our heroes) but for the most part it's a lot more straight forward and less humored. Surprisingly this doesn't detract from the film at all, which is a riveting character journey in classic old school Hollywood fashion. And while generally ""old school Hollywood fashion"" would be something I would cringe and run away from, the Coens make it enjoyable, emotional and breathtaking. The technical qualities are all astounding; fantastic costumes, a beautiful score and some of the most exquisite cinematography I have ever seen, courtesy of the always reliable Roger Deakins. It's such an entertaining film, with some emotional power that resonates afterwards. There's a lot of twists that I didn't see it taking and none of the characters ended up being what I initially expected them to be. There's a real lack of obvious arcs for these people and that was a nice surprise. The Coens do what they can to avoid Hollywood conventions in what is, at it's core, a very Hollywood film.",/review/rw2390775/?ref_=tt_urv

","True Grit (2010) is a new film by Brothers Coen for which they wrote the screenplay based on the eponymous cult western novel by Charles Portis. The novel was first brought to screen back in 1969 with John Wayne as the eye-patched, heavy drinking, trigger happy US Marshall Reuben ""Rooster"" Cogburn in Fort Smith, Arkansas, 1877, the possessor of ""true grit"" who was hired by a 14 year old girl Mattie Ross to find the killer of her father and to bring him to justice.

5 October 2011,gobeGT,10," 10/10 from a guy that does not like western movies
","To be honest I was never a big fan of western movies... Somehow I made myself to watch True Grit - had big doubts about it, but after all it was Coen brothers movie and it got only positive reviews all over internet. When the movie had finished I was completely stunned by how the story got me into it, how interesting and absorbing it was from the very first minutes!!! The characters were so genuine and extraordinary in the same time. I guess each of them could have their own individual movie, but here we had 3 of them crossing their paths of faith. Acting was just PERFECT - honestly I think this is Bridges best role, not to mention fantastic Damon and brilliant Steinfeld! In addition to that scenography and photography was excellent. Everything gave the viewer almost 2 hours of an amazing story, told in the best possible manner. Thank you brothers Coen for this masterpiece!",/review/rw2390775/?ref_=tt_urv

","For those of you miss the star power of John Wayne, don't think that Jeff Bridges tried to imitate the Duke in this version of True Grit. Though the novel was in fact written with the Duke in mind for the lead it had to be adapted to fit his larger than life movie star image. In this version Jeff Bridges is considerably less than larger than life.",/review/rw2390775/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2011,CinemaFrostedBetty,8," A Must-See Film
","Joel and Ethan Coen's True Grit (2010) is undoubtedly one of the best films I have seen all year. Westerns seemed to have fallen off the wagon in Hollywood these past few decades, but the Coen brothers have truly worked their magic, once again, to resuscitate this genre. In this beautifully constructed Western remake of Henry Hathaway's 1969 version, 14-year-old girl Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) sets out with an eye-for-an-eye attitude to capture Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), the man who has mercilessly killed her father. In order for justice to be served she teams up with Reuben J. ""Rooster"" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), a man of ""true grit"" and Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon). True Grit is simple, straightforward (not words one would typically use to describe a Coen Brothers film), but as usual, it's an f-ing masterpiece. What struck me the most about this film was its skillfully crafted ambiance. Everything presented from the costumes to the settings to the dialogue— I felt completely immersed in the narrative. Thanks to cinematographer Roger Deakins for that visual thrill-ride! It's pretty apparent that Jeff Bridges had some major shoes to fill in his role originally played by John Wayne. It's safe to say it was a job well done. His style was completely powerful in this unforgettable performance. Every step he takes or word he speaks is done with thought. If there was an Oscar for 'baddest ass' Jeff Bridges would clearly hold the title, hands down. I was also quite impressed with Hailee Steinfeld's performance. As a newcomer to the Hollywood scene, she makes it pretty clear she means business. Even next to Damon, Bridges, and Brolin, she holds an extremely professional and talented composure. This is most definitely not the last time we will see her on the silver screen.",/review/rw2390775/?ref_=tt_urv

1 February 2011,tavm,10," This version of True Grit by the Coens and starring Jeff Bridges is much improved from the previous version that starred The Duke
","Okay, having seen the entirety of the first filmed version of True Grit on YouTube last night which starred John Wayne and got him his Oscar, I finally watched the recent version that stars Jeff Bridges and is directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. I'll say this right now: Since this one is more closely adapted from Charles Portis' novel and therefore has more details of plot and characterization, I felt this was the better one. Certainly the fact that the Coens are more artistically inclined than the commercially conventional-though still entertaining-Henry Hathaway has something to do with it. Also, Matt Damon gave his LaBoeuf more texture in his portrayal than the ""just read the lines vibe"" of Glen Campbell though since the latter was actually from the southwestern states, he was still adequate enough. And actual young teen Hailee Steinfeld more embodies 14-year-old Mattie Ross than the young adult Kim Darby though the latter was good enough. Likewise, Dakin Matthews compares favorably to Strother Martin as Col. Stonehill, Josh Brolin is a bit more frightening as Tom Chaney than Jeff Corey was, Domhnall Gleeson as empathetic as Dennis Hopper when playing Moon, and Barry Pepper-what a coincidence concerning the same surname for both actor and character-is just as compelling as Lucky Ned Pepper as when Robert Duvall played him opposite The Duke. In fact, Barry sounded just like Duvall so he was perfect. Oh, and while we saw J. Noble Daggett played by John Fiedler in the original, here we only hear him in voice-over as enunciated by J. K. Simmons. And unlike the previous one, this one has an adult Mattie as played by Elizabeth Marvel as she narrates looking back to the events of the movie before we witness her condition at the time of her telling. In summary, this movie deserves the 10 Oscar nominations it got especially those of Bridges, Steinfeld, and the Coens and the music of Carter Burwell was just as compelling as the previous one's Elmer Bernstein. So on that note, this version of True Grit is well worth seeing.",/review/rw2390775/?ref_=tt_urv

4 May 2011,Robert_duder,9," A brilliant remake that surpasses the original with outstanding performances
",I had never seen the original True Grit when I saw this. I have now seen the original and I am even more certain that this remake is everything it could and should have been. It does not only pay homage to the original and even go so far as to recreate almost identical scenes but adds true grit to the film and I'm not only saying that to be clever. The film is dark and gritty and powerful. The lead performances BURY the original (and yes I know that's blasphemy for Duke fans) but these performances are superior in every way. The Coen brothers took a legendary film (over-rated in my book) and made it their own and brought the story to a whole new generation. I wasn't sure what to expect from The Coen brothers as writers and directors. They are certainly unique and often out there film makers and I have seen some of their films but certainly not all of them. Sometimes I think they go too far to be 'unique' but there is no doubt their style and substance and ideas fit True Grit like a glove.,/review/rw2390775/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2011,IleWieszOOsmiornicach,7," The culmination of the movie doesn't give the satisfaction that you would expect.
","Don't get me wrong, True Grit is a good movie. In a time when most films seen in cinemas are made for teenagers, it can appeal to anybody regardless of age. The gunfights (not much) and talking (a lot) give it a nice pace that keeps you on the edge of your seat while not being chaotic enough to confuse your father.",/review/rw2390775/?ref_=tt_urv
