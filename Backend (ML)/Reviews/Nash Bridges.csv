4 May 2020,PriestMarmore,7," Excellent story but disappointing ending
","The story is really interesting and well written. The acting is also very good. However the end is really disappointing. Number one it's really vague and it makes the viewer curious but offers no answer (so I guess you can make your own judgment). Number two it's really dense. A lot of story happens in a short amount of time (time of the episode).
Overall I recommend it and it's a very good series",/review/rw5152662/?ref_=tt_urv

","I really wanted to like this series a lot more. It has an interesting premise, a relatable and sympathetic main character, and a relatively good production value.",/review/rw5152662/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2021,mrsgatorbranch1217,5," The ending is awful!!
","The show was good.... Then it ended on a cliffhanger! No talks about a 2nd season either & it's been almost 2 years since the show ended. With such an extended amount of time since the ending, I doubt a 2nd season will happen.",/review/rw5152662/?ref_=tt_urv

21 September 2019,Nicole244,," 10 stars without any other word
","I saw the opening credits of the first episode and I jumped from my seat from the excitement after seeing the cast!! The series has amazingly good actors. I usually try to not watch a good serie as soon as it's released, because I don't have the patience to only watch 1-2 episodes per week, but this one popped in my Netflix preview and I clicked on it. Now I'm counting the time until when I can see the next episode. It's a great serie that keeps you glued to the screen. Great action, great play and plot. Really looking forward to see how it continues.",/review/rw5152662/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is the first time i am watching a series without realizing i was the end of every episode. the cinema thography, direction, and actors acting was superb and fantastic. i didnt believe it was korean drama for the first time, but it was.",/review/rw5152662/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,ravikumarchandran,6," Started promising.. but became watered down..
","Started very promising. A plane crash initiated by a passenger is a novel idea and is fresh. And his escaping triggering the entire hunt for bad guys was good. But when people decide to get rid of him in later episodes, the entire plot falls through. Why bother taking steps to save him if he can be dispensed with !",/review/rw5152662/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2019,madbird-61243,8," My beloved casting
",Male lead and female lead are both in my favour. Their acting is beyond doubt terrific. Action scene is captivating too.,/review/rw5152662/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2019,daniels-thaabiet,8," If Action with a bit of heart is what you want....you came to the right place
","A series perfect for unwinding and enjoying, it has alot of heart and some awesome action scenes. It's funny, sad and goes at a million miles an hour with action. Its well worth the time for action buffs. Not alot better out there in any case.",/review/rw5152662/?ref_=tt_urv

29 September 2019,kevson7,10," Nice
","I'm from Sweden and I'm used to watch American/European movies and series. This series popped up on my Netflix and I gotta say this series went above all my expectations. The female main character is my new crush, and the male character is a beast hahah! Strongly recommended!",/review/rw5152662/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,the_headspace,7," Starts great, then reverts to type
","The first few episodes are gripping, but about halfway through it reverts to pantomime performances (though not all actors are guilty), incongruent attempts at romance and humour, and baffling/idiotic character behaviour.",/review/rw5152662/?ref_=tt_urv

10 November 2019,irisismail-13679,10," Need season 2 ASAP
","Just finished ep 14. I saw LSG n Suzy (Main characters) said romance is only spoonful in this drama n that the shooting locations was in Morocco, Portugal n South Korea. So i really hope there will be a season 2 soon. Both leads carry the drama so good n tbh i couldn't wait for the next 2 episodes. So many unanswered questions which i dont think could fit in just 2 episodes.
1. What is PM Hong's true intention
2. Who is Samael
3. Hae-ri's story at the beginning of ep 1.
4. Why Dal Geon became a sniper.
5. Lawyer Hong's plot
6. N Vagabond itself - why n what Chief Kang n GI Tae Woon set it up for in the first place?",/review/rw5152662/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2019,vijaygujjar,9," Action packed
",It isn't a regular type of KDrama it's completely action packed & the content wise also it's Good. Each actor in this series they just nailed it with there acting. Especially my fav BaeSuzy as GoHaeri,/review/rw5152662/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2022,Glue2Screen,6," That wasn't the best
","When I first read the synopsis and seeing the cast list, it sounded very interesting. Sadly, despite the cast and action sequences, Vagabond failed to be a cohesive action packed film.",/review/rw5152662/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2019,stani_cv,6," Entertaining but totally unrealistic
","It's a decent show with a very good idea. It borrows a lot from spy movies in general, but pushes it too much to make it completely unbelievable. I am not talking about plot holes, but simply defying all laws of physics, logic, etc.
Without being overly analytical just to mention the case when the main characters get ambushed in a dead-end street with professional assassins on the rooftops. Bad guys armed with automatic and sniper rifles can't hit a bunch of people in a regular car not even 200m away. The good guys on the other hand, armed only with pistols, manage to hit a whole bunch of baddies on the rooftop. More laughable is how 10+ special forces crew gets outsmarted and killed by a handful of people.
No need to spoil it further. It's still watchable and it's fun, but cartoonish at times.",/review/rw5152662/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2021,phd_travel,9," A superb thriller with great action and an exciting story that doesn't let up
","Much of this show is very exciting and well written. Even though it's a complicated story and there are many bad guys and conspiracies it somehow keeps it clear enough with just the right amount of recaps to make things clear. Lots of movie quality action in Morocco. From rooftop chases to snipers to street ambushes and sieges. And the excitement keeps up all the way for 90% of show. Back in Seoul there is a bit of a slow down with the political and corruption things but it's not boring like some other K dramas when it deals with the misdeeds in high places. Maybe a few less bad guys would have been better - it seems most of the top politicians and the NIS are compromised. The political crisis with impeachment and all seems eerily prescient of what happened in the US.
Le Seung Gi is convincing in his action scenes and quite good in the quieter scenes too. Suzy Bae looks great here - the best she looked in all her different series.",/review/rw5152662/?ref_=tt_urv

28 August 2020,Giselle1710,10," A must watch and unlike many kdramas this needs a season 2
","Hats off to the writers! The story was so good and the cast was superb. They executed everything so nicely and I loved the twists in the story. How everything is solved but still there's a piece of the puzzle missing! If u love thriller action mystery with little bit tint of romance, u should definitely watch this!",/review/rw5152662/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2020,xpunisherx,9," One of the best Korean Dramas
","I have seen my fair share of Korean dramas and while I can't say this one is my favorite, it's definitely in my top 3. The main character is so fierce and relentless. There's twists but they don't drag out forever and leave you feeling bored like most shows. Every episode something new and exciting is happening. Also it has the best special effects I've seen in a K-Drama hands down.",/review/rw5152662/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2019,sadiqm900,8," Great show!

28 October 2020,diptinan,9," Abrupt ending
","I think I wasted 16 hours watching what will happen next..but the ending is zero with no justice served to the real culprits, no abrupt end, till episode 15 everything will be okay..but just in one episode they wrapped it up all..without any end..actually ,one will never accept how the story ends.. disappointed. Anyway 9 stars are for the story ,how it goes till 15th episode, the brilliant acting of the cast and the cinematography..16th episode is
simply waste of time...",/review/rw5152662/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2019,steve-butten,," Action packed
","OK only four episodes to this point, but I am hooked. They are released on Netflix, two episodes a week. I won't go into the premise, others will do that. I will just say that the action scenes are taught, slick and well choreographed. This is well worth following. The only criticism I have is that the ""nutcase who doesn't know what he's talking about"" bit, even though the terrorist incident in question should have been obvious to a blind person, is wearing thin. I hope they resolve that one quickly. Otherwise go for it.",/review/rw5152662/?ref_=tt_urv
