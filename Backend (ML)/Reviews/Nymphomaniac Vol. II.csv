","A mother deliberately drives onto a frozen lake with her son. The boy escapes before the car crashes through the ice with the mother willingly waiting for death. In Oslo, expert police detective Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender) is approached by adoring rookie cop Katrine Bratt (Rebecca Ferguson) about cases of missing women. The perpetrator leaves behind snowmen at his crime scenes.",/review/rw3848670/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2019,kuarinofu,6," Mishandled
","First of all, this movie looked and sounded great. Amazing cinematography and good atmospheric score (yet a little loud sometimes, should've been more subtle). The performances were ok for the most part, but it seems like nobody really cared enough to be remembered. I'm not sure though if Fassbender was playing an insomniac or he was just too bored to convey an emotion.",/review/rw3848670/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2020,mahmus,2," What?
","This film is literally unfinished. According to the director, about 15% of the screenplay was not filmed. And it shows. The editors probably tried their best to turn this into a coherent film, but they definitely did not succeed. This is one of the worst edited movies I've seen.",/review/rw3848670/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2017,joshbarton15,4," Started so promisingly too
","The snowy white landscapes of Oslo seemed like the perfect setting for chilling crime thriller The Snowman, a film based on Jo Nesbø's novel of the same name. The trailers promised so much and with a lead actor like Michael Fassbender on board, it had the potential to be one of the most intense films of the year. ",/review/rw3848670/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2017,areatw,5," Puzzling at times, but not the disaster some are making it out to be
","I can't deny that I had high hopes for this film and it disappointed me on many levels, but I do think some of the previous reviews are exaggerating just how bad 'The Snowman' is. The film is messy, even puzzling at times, and very frustrating to watch. It lacks focus and struggles to find its feet early on. It also contains some baffling individual scenes that contribute nothing to the plot or film as a whole.",/review/rw3848670/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2017,InaneSwine,2," Worst thriller of the year
","The Snowman could honestly be a contender for worst thriller of the year. It's dull, boring, confusingly plotted, drearily acted, lazily edited and poses more questions than it can ever be bothered to answer. Why are all the Norwegians in the film British? Why is it set in Oslo? Why does the killer use snowmen as a calling card? What is the purpose of J.K. Simmons character, other than to effectively walk on screen and pronounce, ""And I'm J.K. Simmons""? Who are these women getting their pictures taken with a camera-phone? And finally, how could a film with such a strong ensemble cast and effective cinematography end up being such an unmitigated disaster? I know not one of the answers and, frankly, the time it took me to watch the film and write this review is about as much attention as I'm prepared to give this shoddy work. The most thrilling moment of the film was the end credits, as I could finally leave the cinema. Avoid like the plague.",/review/rw3848670/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2018,latinfineart,2," The abominable snowman
","This movie was an absolute abomination. It felt like it was directed by a 13 or 14-year-old. Totally incoherent, no cohesion to the story, no suspense of the plot, no build up, no let down, no nothing. Just a boring mishmash of complete and utter nonsense. Please, please do yourself a favor and avoid this abominable snowman. It is a complete waste of your time and an absolute piece of garbage. No service to the book on any level. Wow. Terrible.",/review/rw3848670/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2017,Ravnehjerte93,3," A disaster
","The Snowman is a disaster. It's not only a disaster, it's an unfathomable disaster. This film had absolutely everything going for it. I've not read the source material, that the film is based on, but it's being hailed as one the best books in its genre here in Norway. The director, Tomas Alfredson, has made some great films in the past and the cast is great. Yet the film is a complete mess.",/review/rw3848670/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2019,bombersflyup,3," Nothing here.
","The Snowman is a slow monotonous mess, much like a television drama. Not a thriller, that's for sure.",/review/rw3848670/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2019,Beard_Of_Serpico,5," Not as bad as you might have heard but not a classic.
","I read that this movie got some pretty terrible reviews but i kind of enjoyed it. I'm a sucker for cop/detective movies especially ones where the main character is jaded and burnt out and the movie has a great cast - Micheal Fassbender, J.K Simmons and the beautiful Rebecca Ferguson. The story kept me interested all the way through and the Norwegian setting is pretty stunning to look at.
It felt like a TV movie in places though probably because nothing is overly flashy and the movie wasn't particularly action packed but i did enjoy the police procedural elements. It's well acted and i was invested to know what would happen next.
Also you're kept in the dark until the last 15 minutes as to who the killer is and then my reaction was ""Oh, it's that guy....really?"".
Not as awful as the reviews would make you believe but not a classic. If you enjoy detective thrillers i'd say check it out, you'll have a decent time.",/review/rw3848670/?ref_=tt_urv

4 March 2019,DimitrisPassas-TapTheLine,3," A major letdown.
","All fans of Nordic Noir around the globe were expecting the release of this film, that was the first American adaptation of a Jo Nesbø's novel. ''The Snowman'' is the seventh installment in the infamous Harry Hole series and also one of the most horror-like books of the Norwegian super-star crime author. I enjoyed reading the book a few years ago, though I don't think that it is one of the best in this legendary series, as it lacked the ingenuity in plotting that is one of Nesbø's trademark characteristics as a crime writer. Nevertheless I was eager to watch the silver-screen adaptation, especially when I heard that Martin Scorsese was ready to participate in the production team.
Unfortunately, the final result was below mediocre and the ending of a film found me feeling sad that so many viewers around the world will form their opinion on both on the book author and the Nordic Noir as a genre, based on this unsuccessful attempt in producing a crime/thriller that echoes the melancholic mood of the novel(s).
The main -but definitely not the only- flaw with ''Snowman'' is its bad editing which makes the viewer feeling confused over a story that seems to be disjointed and not making any sense in some parts. The pacing of the movie is uneven and jumbled, lacking in both fluctuations and climax. The director, Tomas Alfredson is an experienced auteur and the person behind the camera in major commercial and artistic hits such as ''Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'', and ''Let the Right One In'' seems to be out of his depth in this one, while the actors try to do their best, but without proper guidance make cardboard characters that have little in common with the fleshed-out, compelling characters like Harry Hole or Katrine Bratt.
I can't recommend ''Snowman'' even to the most ardent films of the Nordic Noir genre and those who are fond of Jo Nesbø's Harry Hole universe and characters should better skip this one.",/review/rw3848670/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2017,kluseba,7," Under-appreciated like a fresh snowstorm
","The Snowman is a psychological thriller based upon Jo Nesbo's critically acclaimed novel of the same name. This film received mixed to negative critics but I have to disagree. Despite a few flaws, this film is overall above average in my book. Let's take a look at what several critics had to say and compare their points to my personal experience.",/review/rw3848670/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2017,Field78,7," Pretty cool, but should have been an entire season
","There doesn't seem to be a lot of love for The Snowman, which is a pity since most of the elements I love about Scandinavian crime drama are there: an overall unglamourous look; icy landscapes; a protagonist with emotional issues and difficulties connecting with other people; gruesome killings; dark family secrets, enough red herrings to fill a small sea, and a surprise twist at the end. In fact, had this been a Norwegian movie, then I think that most people would have praised it as pleasantly non-Hollywood, but now they don't now what to make of it so they give it a critical drubbing. Director Tomas Alfredson (of Tinker Tailer Sodier Spy fame) knows how to put the elements together in the best tradition of series like The Killing (Forbrydelsen) and The Bridge (Bron) and films like The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (Män Som Hatar Kvinnor), but, to be fair, The Snowman is also the lesser of this group.",/review/rw3848670/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2017,TheLittleSongbird,2," Great potential completely buried fast
","'The Snowman' had so much going for it. The Norwegian setting (Norway has some of the most beautiful scenery in Europe), a brilliant book, a great cast (usually can't go much wrong with Michael Fassbender and JK Simmons), the involvement of 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' director Tomas Alfredson and one of the best premises of the year.",/review/rw3848670/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2017,OJT,6," Way better on second watch
","The Snowman was right from the start panned with bad reviews. But I found this film was way better on the second viewing, just like Tomas Alfredsons Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy was. Exactly the same way! And that says a lot. Alfredson likes to do some subtle moves.",/review/rw3848670/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2019,southdavid,2," Worth Watching? Nor-way!

14 October 2017,mshavzin,10," Nice, moody thriller.
","Differs from the typical fare with a nice steady build up of suspense, gives satisfying clues, and in the end wraps up the mystery. If you are looking for Jigsaw, then this is not the film for you. I realize that some of the disappointed reviews were from folks who were hoping to be frightened. I personally have no love for shock value, and am never frightened by films. If i wanted to be scared, I would go watch Oprah or the Kardashians to be properly terrified at how absurdly stupid and inane the human race has become. Otherwise there isn't much a screen can do to terrify me. This isn't trying. It has the same goals as Wind River, but it fulfills them better. Probably because Detective Harry isn't a blundering idiot. I am unwilling to give up the plot like some others. I can say; nice pace, good story, not particularly original, but very well done. Exactly as it should be. Its not an art house film. Its a thriller mystery, and a engaging one.",/review/rw3848670/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2017,stephenkemp-60017,3," What a waste of opportunity
",I made the mistake of reading the book again before watching the movie So had high expectations. It was The Snowman that got me hooked on Jo Nesbo and was excited when I saw the trailer. I walked out of it at the end feeling very disappointed.,/review/rw3848670/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2022,levybob,2," TWO STARS FOR THE SCENERY. ZERO FOR THE REST.
","So much negative criticism has been written about 'The Snowman' I really have nothing much to add. It's truly as bad as many of the IMDB Reviewers have said it is. And it's every bit as bad as the Press Critics said it is: it received an average rating of '23' out of a possible '100'. As for the story: It's a mess. A serial killer builds a snowman at the site of every murder he commits. The objective of the film, a 'Who Done It', is to uncover the murderer's identity.",/review/rw3848670/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2019,moemed99,3," Could have been great!!
","The Snowman is a great story, brought to screen by the wrong people. The story is strong and engaging, but the direction is choppy and including Val Kilmer, when he wasn't up for the job was a huge mistake. He is barely understandable and his scenes were misplaced. It is crazy that I'm giving 3 stars to a film with a cast that would make you wanna see it, but nothing about this movie is worth watching.",/review/rw3848670/?ref_=tt_urv

3 November 2017,Jared_Andrews,1," Terribly Dull & Incoherent
","Who would ever name their son Harry Hole? That is one of the many questions that crossed my mind as I watched 'The Snowman,' which I suppose is technically a movie. But it fails miserably to deliver on many of the standard qualifications that 99.9% of all other movies meet.",/review/rw3848670/?ref_=tt_urv
