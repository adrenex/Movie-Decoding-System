17 September 2016,paul_haakonsen,5," Pretty much as sequels usually go...
","I enjoyed the 2010 ""Alice in Wonderland"" that had that unique Tim Burton touch to it. But I wasn't in any rush to get to see the 2016 sequel ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"". Why? Well, because just what more could there be to tell about this story?",/review/rw3797599/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2016,Venom_81,6," Mediocre story with great visual effects
","Tim Burton refused to direct this movie..and there is a reason..simply the script is terrible. There is no real and solid story behind this movie if not a marketing operation. The direction works well, nothing special but nothing you can complain about, also the rhythm and the storytelling works good, the problem is the script. The movie is visually stunning , probably visual effects are the only reason to watch this movie. Jhonny Deep is probably on his worst interpretation, he isn't able to transmit anything not even the madness of his character. Mia Wasikovska is the only one who truly believe in the project and tries to produce a decent interpretation. Sacha Baron Coen is funny on his character but maybe he could add more personality in his interpretation. As I already said you can watch this movie just for the amazing visual effects..but without a decent story isn't so entertaining",/review/rw3797599/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2018,matthewssilverhammer,6," I actually kinda (God, help me...) liked this movie.
","I couldn't have been less interested in this franchise, completely dumbfounded as to why they were trying to make sense out of an intentionally non-sensical world. This sequel continues that journey into unneeded clarity, though with better results. Maybe I was just more prepared for what was to come, but I also think it has decent emotional arcs and cool visual ideas, despite Depp's lazy performance and way too much plot.",/review/rw3797599/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2016,zalouteacher,8," Going back to literature
","I liked the fact that the script of the movie is full of puns and rhymes taken from the original work. This makes the movie as interesting as the original Through the Looking Glass since Lewiss Carroll was famous with riddles and hidden messages in his works and he was known to include mathematical wonders in the writing such as the case of Alice in Wonderland. Maybe the plot was not greasy enough but overall it was a nice movie. The character that I liked most is Hatter( Johnny Depp) who has again striken me with his ability to wear different hats of roles and to impersonate himself in the character he's given. Also, the character of Alice was a fit with her angelic smile that reflects an innocent adult.",/review/rw3797599/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2016,cekadah,2," A confused mess with Mommie Dearest
","The Mad Hatter looked like Faye Dunaway in Mommie Dearest dressed up as Joan Crawford dressed up as Johnny Depp dressed up as the Mad Hatter!? Alice is the Captain of a sailing Frigate!? And could you understand what Sacha Baron Cohen was saying half the time? Even Alice had some indecipherable lines! The Chronosphere, who came up with this wacky idea? I could go on and on about the goofy mess in this movie but it's not worth it.",/review/rw3797599/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2020,lisafordeay,7," Well I enjoyed it better than the 2010 one
","Alice Through The Looking Glass is a 2016 sequel to the 2010 film Alice in Wonderland and this time Alice(Mia Wasakaska) has to travel back in time to save Mad Hatter's family(Johnny Depp). By doing this Alice must go to the time realm owned by Time(an unrecognisable Sacha Baron Cohen) and use a time sphere to go back.
But will Alice be able to change the past.
Bottom line I liked this film. It was also the final film for Alan Rickman(which this film is dedicated to).",/review/rw3797599/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2017,mark.waltz,2," Another evidence of a pretty film....a pretty mess, that is.
","It's a shame that the estates of the writers of classic novels can't sue to prevent the assassination of their ancestor's work. Certainly, there have been revisals of classic books, plays and movies that worked, but more often than not, it's an insult to the memory of the creator. Looking like ""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" meets ""Downton Abbey"" as this begins, this is a beautiful block of ice that drips and drips until there's nothing but a puddle of colored slop left. Already too old in the first film (where we at least had the creativity of Tim Burton to admire if not the film as a whole), but here, it's under new hands, and the claws have torn apart whatever charm was there before.",/review/rw3797599/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2016,albereinstein,7," Don't Believe Any Of The Negative Reviews. This Is GOOD Movie!
","Don't believe any of The negative reviews. This Is a GOOD Movie! I was amazed to see so many negative reviews about a really good movie. My comment is about not believing comments on IMDb. There has been times when I've read positive reviews about a movie, and the move sucked major ass. Now I read negative reviews about a movie that was really good from beginning to end, and it simply amazes me. That's why I've decided to pay no attention to reviews too much and just watch the film and make my own decision on whether its good or not. There are just too many critics and you just can't rely on what you read. Don't get me wrong, some of the reviews are spot on and I find myself in total agreement with some reviews, but this movie was really awesome. I like when a movie keeps my interest the way Alice through the looking glass did. So for anyone looking for a nice escape from reality, don't go by the negative reviews, give this one look. I promise you will not be disappointed.",/review/rw3797599/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2018,Leofwine_draca,3," They shouldn't have bothered
","You know your film's going to be bad when even Tim Burton doesn't come back to direct it, and this follow up to Burton's ALICE IN WONDERLAND is one of the most forgettable Hollywood blockbusters I've seen in a good while. I should note that it has nothing to do with the Lewis Carroll novel, instead mixing together a Wellsian time travel plot as Alice once more heads to Wonderland to rescue the Mad Hatter from a certain death. Right from the beginning, where we see Alice captaining her ship in a big CGI set-piece, I knew this film would be complete nonsense and so it proves. It's one of those slick CGI action adventures in which every single shot has to be packed with CGI landscape, imagery, and characters. The same old annoying characters return from the first film to annoy once more (hello, Helena Bonham Carter) while Mia Wasikowska seems to have mastered that single expressioned, mildly bored look. The story goes through cliche after cliche, merely showing off the latest work from the CGI animators rather than having any kind of real character or warmth of its own, and as such it is quite the bore.",/review/rw3797599/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2016,TheOneThatYouWanted,1," ~ ~ Makes the first one look like Citizen Kane ~ ~
","Spoiler-Free Review. Easily the worse movie I've seen this year. The 2010 version of Alice in Wonderland wasn't a great movie but at least is was entertaining and even watchable at times. This on the other hand is complete garbage. The plot plays like a last minute fan-fiction story you'll find on Reddit. The acting is unimpressive and screams of ""I'm just making this film because of the paycheck."" I went into this movie knowing it wasn't going to be as good as the 2010 film but after almost 15 minutes into the film, I started yawning. At least five people started scrolling on their smartphones about halfway into the film and no one cared, in fact we all understood why. I was tempted to pull out my phone and play around but I hate people who do that during a movie and I didn't want to be one of them. Without giving anything away, the biggest problem with the movie isn't the fact that it is boring. Oh God, it is boring af. But no, that isn't the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that it is just stupid. It is like they made this movie for kids who like watching The Minions movies just because the minions act and do dumb things. This movie must have been a last minute rush job. Anyway. On the bright side, this movie is very forgettable.",/review/rw3797599/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2016,danielharden,2," Time to just stop

20 September 2016,safaa_jolha2,9," I loved every second of it !
","Literally every second of this movie is worth watching ! it's even better than the first one. I love the visual effects, maybe that's why I loved this movie so much, I mean the nature in Underland, the time castle, much effort was put on this movie and it was worth it . I wasn't expecting that much of it, since I didn't expect a good story. But the story of Time is incredible ! And those little seconds of his are so cute, I liked the idea of the white queen not being totally good by lying in her childhood and being part of the reason that made her sisters' head big. I wish there were more parts for the Cheshire cat, I love his grin :D. But, finding The Hatter's family could've taken more light, the hatter just finds them and that's it. We should've got the opportunity to watch more of them after they come back. Still, this movie's became one of my favorite fantasy movies .",/review/rw3797599/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2016,KineticSeoul,3," A headache to sit through
","The first movie was serviceable but this sequel is just trash. Despite the first Alice movie being mediocre at best, it made a lot of money so here we have a sequel that shouldn't have been made. It ruins even the slightest intrigue the first one had. And gets rid of any magical flare when it comes to the characters. I know when it comes to the message it tries to convey about the importance of time. To choose your own path and make the most of it. But a movie's core message is not enough the carry the movie. Despite the high budget it still comes off as a movie with cheesy CGI and lame scenarios. This sequel tries to delve more into the Wonderland characters and their past but destroys the presence and the charisma they once had. Mad Hatter played by Johnny Depp once again came off super annoying. It just seemed like the whole cast was just there for the paycheck. At least in the first one the characters somewhat had a presence and at least seemed like they were trying. The narrative is just all over the place and came off like a huge mess. Over it being a magical fun time...Kids will be super bored with this one. And the adults will get a headache. ",/review/rw3797599/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2016,ccorral419,9," A welcomed step back into the looking glass
","Director James Bobin (Muppets 2011 & 2014), along with writer Linda Wolverton (Alice... 2010) once again bring color, amazing CGI effects and easy storytelling (although a bit complicated at times) to Lewis Carroll's book. Skirting Depp's current personal affairs, he once again captures the Mad Hatter, this time with more believable reserved flair enabling him to slip easily into his shy yet disturbed character. Successfully sharing the primarily (and believable) green screen set is the wonderfully adverturist Mia Wasikowska ""Alice,"" Helena Bonham Carter as big head Red Queen ""Iracebeth,"" Anne Hathaway as the less then attractive floating princesses ""Marana,"" quirky Sacha Baron Cohen as ""Time,"" Matt Lucas as the lovable Tweedledee / Tweddledum, and the wonderful voices (to name a few) of Timothy Spall, Ed Spellers and the late Alan Rickman. ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" isn't rocket science, it's just a good family film filled with colorfully special effects, a familiar storyline and good acting - regardless of what many a film critic are saying. If anything didn't quite fit into the fantasy environment of the film, it was the closing credits song by vocal artists Pink. Where the film places one firmly in a fantasy environment, Pink's song is too current, thus pulling one away from the established dream-state. Regardless, when Awards time rolls around, ""Alice..."" should fill its glass with recognition.",/review/rw3797599/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2020,briancham1994,6," Weird sequel
","This film is quite zany compared to the first one. It has some new additions - the queens and the time travel - that make it quite fresh. However, showing the backstory of the queens can also make them feel too grounded and not surreal enough. The whole ""saving the world"" feel is also a bit too typical for Hollywood. The visual imagination is good as always though.",/review/rw3797599/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2017,jamesrupert2014,1," Noisy, tedious, pointless crap
","How anyone can take 100 million dollars, a tremendous cast and the characters of one of the all-time great children's books and get this tedious drivel is beyond me. The moment I realised that the opening 'pirate adventure' was not just a dream sequence but rather the 'reality' side of some new post-feminist iteration of Alice's life, I knew that I was going to hate this movie - and it did not let me down. All I can hope for is that the dismal returns on Disney's investment guarantees that the studio won't desecrate another classic. Wishful thinking I'm sure - they didn't learn anything from John Carter. There is a reason why people still avidly read these books a century after they were written - they are that good - they don't need to be rewritten, updated, have their characters co-opted or their name and tradition exploited.",/review/rw3797599/?ref_=tt_urv

","If, like me, you think that the Victorian era was a fine time to be writing nonsense and love Lewis Carroll, I hope that you have memorized, as have I, large swaths of ""The Hunting of the Snark"". Don't bother seeing this movie, which is the product of people who have no familiarity with the book, no interest in the book, or are subject to that common delusion, that there's nothing wrong with these old classics that can't be fixed. In this case, there's nothing wrong with Through the Looking Glass that can't be fixed with some very stupid and obvious messages that you can't do anything about your past, but a woman can do whatever she wants to in Victorian London. Plus coming up with explanations for the cause-and-effect of Carroll's nonsense. Because that's what Lewis Carroll needs.",/review/rw3797599/?ref_=tt_urv
