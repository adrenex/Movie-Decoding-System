28 January 2011,beresfordjd,10," Brilliant!!
","Isn't it refreshing for a TV sitcom not to talk down to its audience but to credit the viewer with some intelligence? Frasier is just about the best written sitcom of all time in my opinion. The performances of even the smallest of characters are always of the highest standard. I have watched Frasier episodes over and over again through the years and always find something fresh in them. Whether it is a line I missed or some small physical movement there is always something to savour and to make me laugh again. I know most of the lines off by heart now, but the delivery of those lines is so perfect that I laugh often more than the first time. How Seinfeld got all the plaudits escapes me when Frasier is far superior in every respect. The writers, cast and crew must be so proud of their achievement in bringing this superlative piece of work to the screen.It is sadly missed - though still to be seen in daytime reruns.And I do watch it over and over. Even the episodes I think were not up to scratch bear watching again and are always better than I remember them. I bought the entire series in a boxed set but have never watched it because ti still appears on British TV. If you do not find it funny you have no sense of humour. Genius writers and superlative performances make this unmissable.",/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2006,starlit-sky,10," Frasier has saved my life
","When I first immigrated to Canada I was living in a bachelor apartment which was too small for...well everything. The only entertainment I had was my little TV (small TV for a small apt). This show literally saved me from killing myself. If it wasn't for this show, I would have probably jumped out the balcony or something. Every time I came home in the evening from a fruitless job search, I would turn on the TV and started watching Frasier 2-3 hours straight. And all the situations portrayed in the show with an optimistic look on life really helped me a lot. Frasier became my TV psychologist.",/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2005,soymilk,," A Wonderful Sitcom
","It may have started life as a hopeful spin-off from 'Cheers', but right from the very first episodes, 'Frasier' proved that it had enough style and substance of its own to become a TV legend. Granted, it went on for a couple of seasons too many, and toward the end was clearly starting to suffer from a lack of fresh ideas, but for the most part this was a hilarious, insightful and often very moving programme that my Friday nights throughout the late 90s just wouldn't have been complete without. After so many years of viewing, Frasier, Niles, Martin, Daphne, Roz and Eddie feel like more than just TV characters - they're like your very own neighbours, or even great friends.",/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2003,Silverzero,," Upper-class, very entertaining and likeable sitcom.
","Rather like Friends and Seinfeld, Frasier is one of those sitcoms of the 90's with mass appeal. While it probably isn't as internationally famous as ""Friends"" it is every bit as good as it. Over the years, ""Frasier"" has remained a consistently entertaining and ultimately satisfying sitcom. It always has fresh, witty material and hopefully will continue for another few years. The cast all work perfectly together, the overall effect is very good. ""Frasier"" is one of the best sitcoms on television today.",/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2019,nicholls_les,10," I'm Listening!
","What an amazing series this was. One of the best comedy series ever produced, excellent actors, writers and directors. It is unusual to say this but there are no flaws with this wonderful comedy. It still makes me laugh after watching it several times. Perfectly developed characters make this stand out from many other comedy series.",/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2000,Old Crow-2,," Saturday night would be nothing without this
",Simply one of the best sitcoms on tv ever! This series has a very good cast and script writers. I recommend  this to everyone who likes intelligent comedies. Many of the sitcoms on tv are poor but this one really shines. Saturday nights wouldnÂ´t be Saturday nights without it.,/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2003,shrek2004,," A gem.
","This is a good show. Hilarious, in fact! I am sad to see it didn't get as much publicity as ""Seinfeld"" and ""Friends"" over the years, perhaps then it would have gotten a bigger fan base. This show's humour is refined and elegant, and it's always funny to see Frasier's ego grow.",/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2002,TheNovelist,," Why can't all TV shows be as intelligent as this?
","I love this TV show, and I try to watch it as much as possible!  The humor is intelligent unlike some TV shows that have humor that is stupid and immature and predictable.  You just have to laugh at all the situations that Niles and Frasier get into that could have been prevented in the first place if they weren't so concerned with appearances, hence the episode when they wanted to see that actor's final stage performance but couldn't because they would not get cancellation tickets! Jane Leeves' Daphne Moon is a wonderful character; she tries to offer words of advice to the Crane family that are sadly ignored most of the time. Martin is funny as the dad who is clueless as to reasons why his sons won't embrace the ordinary life(and I want a chair as comfy as his).  I like how Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce showcase their musical talents on the show(and I can tell that isn't fake piano playing) quite often.",/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2011,AlsExGal,9," Classy comedy from beginning to end
","When Kelsey Grammar first introduced himself to Sam Malone as psychiatrist Frasier Crane on ""Cheers"" back in 1984, who would have believed that this television character would tie James Arness' Matt Dillon at twenty years of playing the same TV character? ""Frasier"" could hardly be called a sequel to ""Cheers"", though, in spite of guest appearances by alumni of that show that appeared pretty regularly in the early years. Frasier's new job on a radio show combined with his neurotic family and friends were a perfect setting for Frasier's trademark sarcasm and biting wit. The show seemed to lose a little steam around the time that Niles' pining away for Daphne actually became a relationship at the end of season seven through the middle of season eight, but the show could have perhaps overcome that had it not been for the tragic death of David Angell on September 11, 2001. Angell was the mastermind behind some of the funnier episodes of ""Cheers"", the creator of the series ""Wings"", and he was the creative force behind ""Frasier"". It just seemed like the show ran out of steam for a couple of seasons after Angell's death, but then came roaring back in its eleventh and final season. That's not to say that seasons nine and ten were bad seasons by network TV standards, they just weren't up to my expectation levels considering how funny and creative the show had been over past years. ""Seinfeld"" and ""Friends"" got more press and had a bigger fan base during the 90's, but Frasier consistently delivered the laughs over the years with a refined and elegant style of humor.",/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2018,thesmythley,9," Without a doubt, the funniest, touchingly humanistic US sitcom.
","Frasier has a witty, ironic, heart-warming and occasionally self-deprecating humour. Kelsey Grammar's portrayal of the generous, bordering on vain Frasier Crane is brilliant and it is always funny when his gleefully executed pretensions are shot down by the other characters, especially his father and Roz. I think that the humour of the show would be non-existent without well thought out dialogue exchanges between each character. Each character has a depth to them so that you never feel like they're just present within the show as merely a form of comic relief. That said, there are some hilarious side characters, such as Bebe Glazer, who add a little anarchy to the social dynamic of the show and serve to test Frasier's character.",/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2006,ian959,10," The best TV sitcom ever
","Whilst a good fan of ""Cheers"", I was somewhat surprised when it was announced that the Frasier character was getting s spin-off series. I did not see how this was going to work and had rather low expectations for both the show and how long it would last. A decade later and ""Frasier"" turned out to be simply the best TV sitcom ever made. Virtually unique in concept and presentation, there has been hardly a dud episode in the show and the cast has proved to be one of the best ever assembled for any TV show, certainly in the United States. I doubt that this show will ever be surpassed on mainstream US TV and it would be hard to imagine life without ""Frasier"" either on TV or on DVD. Repeated viewings remain as enjoyable as the first time viewing on TV. Simply the very best.",/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2003,Aaron1375,," Great show.
","Mainly it is a great show thanks to the cast.  Everyone in the show does a good job.  The thing that has made the show work from the beginning is the interplay between the characters.  The two brothers, Niles and Frasier who are opera loving cultured type people, and their dad the sports loving everyman is great.  Also, I can sort of relate to some of the characters as well.  I am a sports fan who doesn't go into all that fancy stuff, but like Frasier I have trouble with women.  The show rarely has episodes I don't care for, and I usually get a good laugh during every show.  I have taped almost every episode from TV as well.  Hopefully, this show will keep going for a long time, but I am afraid it is nearing the end.",/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2020,jonny_mcclatch,9," The best comedy spin-off you'll ever see.
","Normally spin-offs of any kind usually leads to huge disappointment even if the original show wasn't that good. But i'd go as far to say not only is Frasier great, I would say it's better than Cheers and Cheers was a great show itself. As cliche as the comment is, it is the most intelligent sitcom i've ever stumbled upon. It fills me with joy that this show emerged in the early 90s, I don't think the brand of humour would still be as accessible for the mainstream audience of today. Even though part of the brilliance is that you really don't have to be cultured nor talked down to, to understand it. That's largely down to such a solid cast and writers, their professional lives might not be relatable but the characters and what they experience through the series is very relatable. If all else fails i'd watch it just to listen to Kelsey Grammer, he could sing about salad and eggs and i'd still be drawn in by that mans voice.",/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2021,atlasmb,10," Top Of The Heap
","Comedy is in the eye and/or ear of the beholder. And yet we sometimes argue that one comedy series is better than another. In fact, it seems undeniable that some comedies are superior to others---at least when one considers a comparison based on averaged opinions, like IMBd scores. Few people would argue that ""F Troop"" is superior to ""M*A*S*H"", for example.",/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 1999,Rose-35,," Very funny show
","This is one of the funniest shows on tv. Kelsey, David and the rest work so well together and are very funny. No wonder it's won the emmy for best comedy all those years in a row. I can't believe Ally McBeal beat it out this year. I don't think that show is half as funny as Frasier. What makes it even better is that the show has Peri Gilpin who is the daughter of the great Jim O'Brien who was a newscaster/weatherman for Philly news. I see where she gets her talent! Anyway Frasier is a great show that anyone would enjoy!",/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2005,royu,," Quality, quality, quality.
","I enjoy watching Seinfeld and Becker more than I enjoy watching Frasier, but Frasier leaves them both behind in genuine sitcom quality. The cast is brilliant and the writing is absolutely top-notch. The first 5 seasons was probably the best display of American sitcom of all time, if not international sitcom. Unfornunately the show ran out of steam in the final few series when the energy seemed to slip away from both the writing and acting.",/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2019,Lew777,10," Just the Best !!
","Always a guaranteed laugh, with French-farce comedy situations and richly drawn supporting characters as Frasier tries to look for love in Seattle while working as a radio psychiatrist. Magnificent comedy of the highest order. Nothing has come even close to it's quality. If you've never seen it, do yourself a favour and watch it !",/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv

26 April 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10," A gem of a sitcom!
","Another American sitcom I really like is Will and Grace. Both shows are really funny, but I like this show more. Kelsey Grammar, voice of Sideshow Bob in Simpsons and Vladmir in Anastasia is just superb as radio psychiatrist Frasier Crane, a man with his failures but has a heart that makes anyone warm to him. And he is surrounded by some truly talented comedy actors, especially David Hyde Pierce(who starred alongside Tim Curry in the fantastic stage musical Spamolot) as his brother Niles. I loved John Mahoney as the father, and Peri Gilpin as Roz. My favourites are Jane Leeves with her character's silly humour, and Moose(one talented animal) as Eddie, who got the most laughs as Martin Crane's staring dog. The script is intelligent, witty and cleverly-structured, and there is enough style and substance to make it memorable. And the song at the end is quite catchy. Although I am sad it ended in 2004, I am glad it got a decent ending. 10/10 for a gem on American television. Bethany Cox",/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2017,sundevilemily,10," One of my favorite shows now after watching it on Netflix
",I always wondered for a while what the show Frasier is like and I saw that it was on Netflix and I decided to watch the first episode and go from there to see if I really liked it.Now I am almost done watching season 3 since I watched the first episode and it is such a funny show to watch and it's a show where people can really connect to.Kelsey Grammar does such a great job at bringing heart and soul to the character Frasier Crane who helps out people on his radio talk show.,/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2009,wilsr,10," Amid a sea of dross, Frasier stands out
","What can I add to the many positive reviews here of the Frasier series? I would watch ""Cheers"" if I happened to be at home when it was shown, but it was never a priority in my life, although I did think it was among the best TV sitcoms.",/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2018,bettycjung,8," A binge-worthy sitcom series
","4/29/18. I hate to admit this but I binge-watched the entire series this month! While it was 11 seasons long, mercifully, the episodes were short, so you can watch about 3 episodes an hour. I originally watched the character, Frasier on Cheers and found him to be an insufferable snob. Only Lillith made him tolerable. Neuwirth was so good in that role. Glad they brought her back to guest star in this series. But because this series lasted 11 seasons I figured it had to be good to last this long. I was glad I took the time to watch this. It is a well-written and well-produced sitcom with a nice blend of characters that counter-balanced one another. Frasier continues to be a snob, but he meets his match with his brother, Niles, who is a much nicer person but just as snobby as Frasier. Their father, Martin, is the stablizing factor in the rivaling siblings. It's so incredible for such a down-to-earth man to have these 2 sons, but many working-class parents can identify with him when they have college-educated children who all of a sudden act like they are too good and too smart to hang with their parents. Daphne adds a nice comedic touch who offers a more refined perspective but is never accepted as an equal until she marries Niles. And, finally, Roz, who is my favorite character, adds the touch of reality the boys need to be somewhat likable. The ending was good. This is a series worth catching.",/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2020,fensser,9," one of the best
","Great all-time sit-com. it started to go downhill when they introduced Daphne's mother as a regular cast member. she wasn't funny, she was nasty and gross, those episodes are unwatchable. the last season was ruined by Laura Linney, her over-acting is intolerable, don't know how she's maintained a career for so long...",/review/rw0316173/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2004,aberry-4,," If you don't get it, you don't understand
