8 September 2022,bencarterxd,9," Very enjoyable so far
","Unlike the 1-star reviews, I've actually watched the damn show instead of giving up after the first 5 minutes. No, this isn't another Resident Evil - it's not nearly as bad. In fact, I personally find it to be pretty fun, and a large improvement over most other modern Netflix Cash-grabs.",/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2022,star_hazard,9," Similar to Misfits but less comedy and more ""action sorta serious feel""?
","It's campy with some angst. A bit more drama with relatable human reactions since they never wanted to be monsters but it's not heavy psychological terror nor ""edgy emo""... They don't really dwell on that. Kept things fairly light hearted. It has kind of a dry-wit humor if you're into that. Colorful and not gray/drab which is always a plus! The overall vibe is very...modern grunge?",/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2022,pieralexrousseau,8," Fun teenager show
","I went into this having kinda low expectation, and I was pretty surprised to be honest. I find that the general flaws of teenager shows weren't there or were very mild compared to others.",/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,avatar_z,7," Silly fun
","Went into this with zero knowledge, popped up on my ""because you liked this other show you may like this"" list so gave it a go.",/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2022,crolaran,9," Netflix ruined a great show by setting the wrong expectations
","Netflix decided to call this show Umbrella Academy meets the Boys. Luckily I, as a fan of both those shows, didn't learn about that description until I had binged the whole series. It has hardly any resemblance to those shows. And if I had gone into it expecting the same experience, I would have been disappointed. However, that doesn't mean it's a bad show. Lovable characters and an interesting plot make it very enjoyable if you go in with the right expectations. Hope to see a season 2. I saw a bad review ranting about 21 year old scientists being unrealistic. What 21 year olds they could possibly be talking about, I have no idea. Also if a person in their early twenties working in a lab is weird to you then please don't go to any universities. You will freak the F out. In summary: Wrong expectations set. Very good show. Dumb reviewers.",/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,nattyj-80129,6," The first episode gave me a headache but then...
",Literally this show's first episode gave me a headache. The first 10 minutes specifically with that punk band and all that off key screaming. But after the second episode it became enjoyable enough to binge a couple episodes a day and it seemed to get better in the second half of episodes.,/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2022,lmiller-90007,7," Screeching sounds be damned
","I will say that I like this show. It's got a decent plot, albeit a little corny. But it's fun. The pacing is good and there are some mildly scary scenes. I don't think the characters are extremely likeable, but that doesn't really bother me. It's your average unethical scientist plot, but there are some decent twists. CGI isn't horrible for the type of budget I'm assuming they had.",/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2022,kaefab,8," such a low score WOW
",I found out about this from a video on youtube and best sci fi serie on netflix.,/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2022,marcosarferreira,6," Fun but not special
",The series lacks a strong storyline and some bases through the episodes .,/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2022,gageboss,10," Fun exciting
","I thought for a series that only had 10 episodes it was a really fun entertaining story. I love all three of the main characters as the complement each other perfectly. I really loved this show and the ending, I hope that gets at least a second season. The characters are very easy to get connected to and to relate to in a way. I love the casting they picked for this show and the actors did a great job. It never got boring and always had you waiting to see what happens next! I highly recommend this show to anyone thinking about watching it! Go watch the show and I think you will love it. I hope just hope Netflix doesn't cancel this amazing show.",/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv

12 September 2022,natalia-10120,7," It could have been better.
","Okey so I watched the whole thing in one night. So it's not terrible, but damn there are a lot of plot holes here, like come on you can't just make a series that is so fast paced and expect it to get great reviews now can ya?",/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,wild_orchid88-530-325600,9," A good cross between Alphas and Misfits
","Don't really get where are the hate is coming from, I found this show totally binge worthy! The music is on point, the powers are great fun and the acting is totally fine for the type of series this is aiming to be... Something that doesn't take itself too seriously and has lots of plot twists, like a Clue game but with superpowered people and mad science.",/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2022,Kenjislamberry,8," Decent Coming of Age Scfi
",I binged watched it over the last few days . I have seen people compare to the british series misfits . I haven't seen that show yet . The imperfects is a entertaining scfi .,/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2022,chunter76422,10," This show is imperfect, but in a GOOD way!
","Don't listen to the haters, this show is light, cool, fun and a wee bit scary. It's exactly what it's suppose to be. Any show today about people with powers is judged by Marvel and DC standards but they shouldn't be. You have to accept this show for what it is and just let yourself enjoy the ride. This show has an interesting if not obvious story in that the characters are looking for answers and growing closer to each other along the way. I hope they get the opportunity to explore take this show in to new and interesting directions. It is really refreshing good to see new faces and rising talents in this show.",/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2022,grangeheights,4," Reasonably good but messes with my tinnitus
",This show kind of ambles along at walking pace. Some likeable characters and some that are just annoying. Special effects are passable but that's ok. The plot is reasonably ok with some logic holes. Some parts could have benefited from being fleshed out more. The secret semi government agency doesn't really make much sense for some reason.,/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,jeradl,10," Great dark super power series
",I'm on the 5th show in the series at the moment and so far it has been a great kind of dark super power show. I am not sure what the negative reviewers were watching because their comments don't line up with the show. The actors are good and the characters are written very realistic.,/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2022,katy-993-427643,9," It's a fun story
","The Imperfects is engaging, hilarious and fun to watch. The characters are all enjoyable and watching how they grow through the show is has been the best part. There's a bit of mystery, a bit of drama, a bit of comedy, and a good representation of Auditory Processing Disorder.",/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2022,thecrowfam,1," This wins the dumbest show award
","This could've been a good show, but it was written for people with the mental capacity of a 5-year-old and cluttered with unrealistic, obnoxious characters. This could be amusing if you're 5 or a bored teen, but this is in no way appropriate for the age range it's seemingly geared for. It's poorly put together. The scripting is clich√© and really ridiculous. I don't think anyone consulted with actual scientists before writing this nonsense, but it wouldn't matter because it's just a pile of irritating characters acting stupidly in poorly laid out situations. No adults are going to watch this and find it remotely good. I suspect the high ratings are from bored teens or maybe the actors themselves. The scientist, Alex has got to be the most obnoxious, unbelievable character on Netflix.",/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2022,jeroen47,7," The first six episodes are fun (8/10)
","After reading some reviews here, I started my watch expecting the series to be not that good and not taking it seriously. With this attitude, and skipping some parts if the first episode, the first six episodes were actually fun to me. I give them a rating of a solid 8/10.",/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2022,meglives,10," Idk what I love about this show but I love it
","I started watching today as I lounged around the house and have ended up obsessed. It's got just enough blood, gore and laughs for me. I love it. But if you ask ""what do you love?"" I'll laugh and say ""I'm not sure but I can't stop watching!"" I'm big into Witcher, Sandman, etc. Just finished Raising Dion on a dissatisfied note, so this was a breath of fresh air from season two of that.",/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,derkrys,6," It's okay
","We did not went into this with high expectations. We wanted some easy, mindless fun and monster action. And for the first half of the season, it totally delivered. Unfortunately the second half drags. The over all storyline seems lost and the characters either revolve round themselves or change their direction every 5 Minutes.",/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2022,smeglinm,1," poorly written & BOOORING
","My lord. I gave it an honest shot- 3 episodes. It was pure torture getting through them. A bunch of random (diverse) people with far-fetched ""powers"" that make no sense whatsoever. There's no consistency with their powers- it's like they asked a 7 yo what powers they should give each character. Netflix continues its downward spiral of horrible content. There's no plot. The writing is so novice- so boring. You need more than gore and curse words to make a story- the story went nowhere after 3 episodes. The acting is college level, the effects are high-school level. 3 episodes watching them look for a doctor so they can get pills- no ones cares... too bad, it really could've been something good but the writing is just miserable. I bailed.",/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2022,pnickovich-781-88739,3," The Imperfects is exactly that...imperfect
","How people are rating this a 9 and above is beyond me. The show suffers from poor pacing, poor script, mediocre acting, overexaggerated, unlikeable and bland characters and a whole bunch of scientific pseudobabble packed in an already (I reiterate) lame script - all for the sake of coming across as edgy, angsty and funny to target young adults. Here's just one of the multitude of issues - Reputable published 18-21 year old geneticists seem to be everywhere according to this show. At least try to root it in some form of reality (yes I understand its fiction but come on, at least try to sell it). There was definitely a concept for the show in there somewhere. Unfortunately the producers never tapped into it. Watch the misfits. Same concept just better. Netflix really either underestimates its audiences or intentionally insults them. Or maybe it's because netflix really believes its target to be 12 and figured who they're too stupid too care. I tried giving this show a chance, god knows i did. Particularly being an avid watcher of most things supernatural/sci-fi and fantasy it just had to be done. But this was shameless. Anybody considering this a quality show shouldn't have an opinion as you are part of the problem. The same ones who have enabled companies, streaming services and producers to get away with producing trash for the sake of a cheap cash grab. Welcome to the age of Kardashians.",/review/rw8525276/?ref_=tt_urv
