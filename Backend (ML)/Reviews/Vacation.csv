31 December 2016,claudio_carvalho,5," A Thriller with Great Potential and Cast, Wasted by a Poor Screenplay and Inadequate Direction
","The divorcée Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt) commutes every day to New York by train and watches the old house where she lived with her husband Tom Watson (Justin Theroux) through the window. Rachel is an alcoholic and sterile woman that frequently has blackouts and shares an apartment with her friend Cathy (Lura Prepon). Tom is married with Anna Boyd (Rebecca Ferguson) with the baby Evie. Their babysitter is Megan Hipwell that lives with her husband Scott (Luke Evans) in the same neighborhood in the suburb. Rachel admires Megan and Scott since she believes they are the perfect couple. However Megan is a promiscuous woman that has affairs with many men including her psychiatrist Dr. Kamal Abdic (Édgar Ramírez). When Rachel sees Megan kissing another man on the balcony of her house, she decides to have a conversation with Megan after drinking in a bar. However she has a blackout and awakens with bruises in her apartment. Soon she learns that Megan is missing and Detective Riley (Allison Janney) that is in charge of the investigation visits Rachel to interrogate her since the neighbors had seen an alcoholic woman wandering in the area. However Rachel does not recall what she did that night. Rachel decides to investigate the case and has dreadful discoveries about her life and Tom. Who might be the killer?",/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2019,sddavis63,6," It Overcomes A Slow and Confusing Start And Becomes A Solid Movie By The End
","To say the least, ""The Girl On The Train"" is a very dark movie. Unsettling. Confusing. Even baffling. There's an uneasy feel to this from the start. Something's off. Something's not right. Is this even reality, or is it a fantasy taking place inside the mind of a very disturbed woman? The disturbed woman in this case is Rachel (Emily Blunt.) She's an alcoholic and rides the same train every day, past the house where she used to live with her ex-husband. She sees their neighbours, and wonders about them and about their relationship. The female neighbour is the nanny to her ex-husband, his new wife and their baby. The movie mixes the story of all three (Rachel, Anna - the new wife, and Megan - the nanny) together. What drives it forward is that Megan has gone missing, and the question is what happened to her and who was responsible.",/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2016,TheLittleSongbird,3," Derails very quickly
","The book is a terrific and engrossing read, with a lot of tension and suspense, a clear timeline and while the characters are unpleasant you understand why they are.",/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2018,LaoagMikey,9," This is a real sleeper of a movie.
","I almost turned this movie off at 30 minutes. That's my cutoff time for bad ones. For some reason, I left it playing and kinda watched it. It was a very slow burn. The first 30 minutes were a snoozer. But then just after my cutoff time, the plot started moving forward. If you are going to watch this, plan on being bored for 30 minutes but the rest of the movie more than makes up for it. And you really have to watch it. There are so many entanglements that you won't know who is doing what to whom and why without really paying attention.",/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv

4 January 2017,wayne-robb,9," Brilliant
","I have been on IMDb for a number of years and always rate the movies i watch. I have not written many reviews,however i think i needed to write this one. This film is brilliant. I haven't read the book but the story was excellent and having read reviews i am disappointed with the negative reviews of this masterclass in story and film making. Do not be put off folks, this was a real thriller mystery and deserves a big 9.the acting was superb,and having been in a drunken state myself for a time they couldn't have put it more realistic. Enjoy its really good, please check my review scores before taking my opinion,i don't like crap as you will see.",/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is an excellent mystery/thriller that had me 'grasping at straws' for a solid hour or so, trying to figure out who was 'good' and who was 'bad.' And...it's punctuated with a ""killer ending!"" (Yes, pun intended ~)",/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2016,bartonj2410,8," Thriller that serves up a real mystery
",We've all experienced the same monotonous train commute to work in our lives at some point. You go by the same places and see the same faces each and every day. None of us have quite had a commute that changes our lives quite like Rachel Watson in The Girl on the Train though.,/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2018,StorieLuver,10," How one person's selfishness can destroy multiple lives
","By titling the book and movie ""The GIRL on the Train"" and making Rachel the narrator/protagonist, the audience is fooled into thinking this is Rachel's story, when really it isn't. This is TOM's story, and how his selfishness and single-minded pursuit of his own wants and desires ruins other people's lives. So here's a summary of the story, when you retell it from Tom's perspective:
Tom wants the stereotypical perfect suburban life with the stay-at-home wife and 2.5 kids. He marries Rachel, but it turns out she can't give him children. So rather than adopt (because they wouldn't be ""his"" children, which I believe the book did point out), Tom starts cheating on Rachel and lets her become a raging alcoholic. Tom divorces Rachel, leaving her life a total shambles, and moves on to marry Anna, who promptly produces the baby he wants. When Anna then starts to focus on the baby rather than Tom, he starts ANOTHER affair with Megan (because of course, it's still all about Tom and what he wants). Unfortunately for Megan, who doesn't want children because of a trauma in her past, she becomes pregnant with Tom's child. Well, Tom can't have a pregnant mistress ruining his ""happy"" marriage with Anna, so he murders the inconvenient mistress. And that, in a nutshell, is the real plot line of this story. So what is the role of the girl on the train, other than to be the discarded, barren first wife who turns to alcoholism to deal with the loss of her husband and home? In an act of karma, she gets to witness (from her train) a piece of evidence which draws her into Megan's disappearance/murder and ultimately bring Tom to the justice he so richly deserves.",/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2016,danielharden,2," Trainwreck
","Based on a best selling novel and with a huge marketing campaign to back the film, The Girl On The Train oddly became one of the most anticipated films of the Autumn to Christmas period... But instead of being the Guardians of the Galaxy of this period the film fairs as well as this years Suicide Squad. The Girl On The Train is absolutely terrible and I feel rather sorry for Emily Blunt who I feel is left alone trying to salvage this wreckage.",/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2016,paulmcuomo,2," Read the book. No, seriously, read the book, it's so much better than this
","The Girl on the Train is a novel that kind of jumped up on the world, especially with the unbelievable success of the book and movie versions of Gone Girl. Since then, this sub-genre of Domestic Noir has exploded and it seems that every novel that can be compared to Gone Girl has been optioned for a film: this, and Renee Knight's Disclaimer had the film rights purchased before the novels were even released to the public! It's a bandwagon that needs to stop, because I cannot understand how this movie could've been so disappointing and poor as it is.",/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2017,liorreem,9," Emily Blunt worth an Oscar!
","I read some of the reviews here, and came with very low expectations to this movie, and WOW, what a pleasant surprise! Blunt gives here the show of her life, way above the level of acting in ""edge of tomorrow"". The story itself takes time to build but it all adds to the atmosphere, and finally you get a fair amounts of twists and turns. Bennett and Ferguson also acting very well, which all adds (to my opinion) to a great film. And to all the men that say it's a ""men hating"" film, I say that you really have a low self-confidence to come up with such a statement... I would risk to say it's one of my 2016 best films, and I will be surprised if Blunt will not be an Oscar nominee for this film.",/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2018,Tweekums,9," A gripping psychological thriller with plenty of twists
","This psychological thriller opens with Rachel, a commuter on a train into New York, looking out of the window. As they pass through the area where she used to live with her ex-husband, Tom, she looks at the house two doors away. She observes a woman, Megan, standing on the porch. She doesn't know anything about the woman but in her mind she imagines what her life might be like. In reality Megan was working as a nanny for Rachel's ex and his wife Anna until recently. Then one day Rachel sees Megan with a man who isn't her husband and is infuriated as it reminds her of how her marriage ended. She decides to get off the train at that station and as she does so she confronts a woman in a tunnel... the next thing she knows she is waking up at home covered in blood. It turns out Rachel is an alcoholic who is prone to blackouts and the day she got off the train was the last time anybody saw Megan. Rachel approaches Megan's husband Scott and, from photographs, identifies her psychiatrist as the man she saw Megan with. What follows is an investigation into what happened to Megan; there are many possibilities and Rachel is not the most reliable of witnesses; so much so that she doesn't even know if she was somehow involved in whatever happened.",/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2016,Sleepin_Dragon,9," Award for Emily? Should be....
","The first point I'm going to make is that this film is outstanding, prior to seeing it, people made the point that it's very similar to Gone Girl, I agree to z minor extent, but in my opinion this is the better film. The story is wonderfully clever, how many of us haven't sat on a train, looked out and people and wondered how different our lives would have been, had we made different choices. The way the story unfolds is loaded with intrigue, you keep asking questions in your mind, all the way through to the revelation at the end. I always knew Emily Blunt was a class act, I just had no idea she was THIS good, she produced an utterly incredible performance as the tormented Rachel, it will be an outrage if awards don't follow for her. Justin Theroux, Luke Evans, to name just a few are also brilliant.",/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv

",Bitterly disappointing.,/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2016,Quinoa1984,4," dull
","The Girl on the Train boasts a (mostly) intriguing performance by Emily Blunt; she commits to this character as what appears at first to be a 'drunk mess' and is one of three major woman characters in this story of deception and murder. But the plot is simply dumb, and more than that is deathly dull. This would barely pass muster as an episode of Law & Order (or for that latter obviously Lifetime), and despite the appearance of the occasionally dependable Justin Theroux (remember him in Mulholland Drive?) the cast doesn't bring anything to the threadbare characters. The rest of what is essentially a soulless Lifetime movie has nothing to offer. What a lump of a 'thriller'. Even a scene like the one woman describing a tragic incident with her infant that IS dramatically potent gets lost in the slop that is this plot and story and... What characters to even speak of? Forget about Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train made me pine for *What Lies Beneath*!",/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2016,Magic_Lantern,5," Gone Girl without the tension, emotion or drama
","First off, I will admit that I've not read the bestselling book that The Girl on the Train is based on so my thoughts are based purely on the movie adaptation.",/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2022,boblipton,4," Obvious And Dull
","It's reportedly a story which shocked the world or some portion of it. My conclusion was that they were easily shocked, since it turned out to be another Cozy Mystery in which Emily Blunt (giving a typically fine performance), playing a depressed alcoholic subject to blackouts, singlehandedly outdetectives professional detective Alison Janney and the entire Ardsley-on-the-Hudson police department; then, in the typical Cozy Mystery trope, having figured out who the psychotic killer is (I figured it out when Lisa Kudrow showed up), goes and confront the maniac single-handedly and tells the madman that she is going to the police.",/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2017,TxMike,," Well-made murder mystery, worth a look.
",We watched this at home on BluRay from our public library.,/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2017,GandLNY,7," Well done, complex mystery
","Well, I enjoyed this movie to the point I would watch it again to catch some of the nuances you miss during first viewing. The story is a bit complicated with several couples in overlapping relationships, but that makes it interesting. The actors are all good with real responses to the surprise events. Unveiling the main character's, Rachel, story in drunken snippets adds to the tension. Some other reviewers complain about plot points that don't make sense but, in some cases, it's because the reviewer did not understand the plot and the inter-relationships of the characters. Special credit to Emily Blunt and Haley Bennet for portraying the angst in their personal situations.",/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2016,lorriejinx,2," Southern Rail provide more drama
","Saw the film two days ago. It started alright but just never really went anywhere in terms of drama, intrigue, pace, suspense or any of the key components of a murder mystery thriller. By the end of the film you just don't feel anything for any of the film's main characters. Having not read the book, I can't say whether the book is suspenseful but the film has less drama than the current Southern rail conductors strikes. When eventually the killer confronts Emily Blunt's character you really don't give a flying fig. The film makes me relish even more, wonderful murder thrillers like Jagged Edge, Seven, Fargo, The lives of others, Silence of the Lambs, and Basic Instinct.",/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2016,Chiller7,10," I liked it, even if mystery thriller is not my usual kind of genre
","I don't usually watch mystery thriller dramas - I generally only go to big budget action movies. I knew next to nothing going in about what this movie was about, which is probably the best way to go into this movie (so in this review I'm not going to discuss the plot at all, just how I felt about the movie - it's better this way). I knew Emily Blunt was in the movie and that it was based on a novel and that's really about this it. Despite all this, I actually liked this movie.",/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2017,pc95,7," Entertaining Mystery
","(Big Spoilers) Directed smoothly by Tate Taylor, mystery/suspense movie ""The Girl on the Train"" doesn't break any originality margins, but it nicely entertains. In the jig-saw puzzle style, Taylor has Emily Blunt, Haley Bennett, and Rebecca Ferguson in a trio of decent performances. The story could be a bit overlong, and somewhat far-fetched in some character reactions and scenes, but I enjoyed the old-school mystery. You have to swallow disbelief in the idea that Blunt's character juxtaposes her recollections of how she acts. Alcohol is a ready-made explanation for this, but anyway, if you're looking to poke holes in the story, you could. And sometimes movies don't deserve the benefit of the doubt, but I found it more fun to just watch this one. 7/10",/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2016,MOscarbradley,3," Taylor drags this one out.
","Is ""The Girl on the Train"" this year's ""Gone Girl"" or is it this years ""50 Shades of Gray""? Sadly this 21st century 'women's picture' is more Gray than Gone and had me crying out for the good old days of Bette and Joan. Instead we get Emily Blunt, (so much better than the material she's given to work with), as well as Jennifer Lawrence lookalike Haley Bennett and Rebecca Ferguson as three women caught up in a fairly obvious murder plot. These are women who have suffered the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune mostly at the hands of the men in their lives, here played by Justin Theroux, Luke Evans and Edgar Ramirez.",/review/rw3560337/?ref_=tt_urv
