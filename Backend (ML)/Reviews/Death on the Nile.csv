30 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," I miss this show!
","The Mentalist is easily one of my favorite police shows of all-time. I loved every episode of every season. It's only been off the air for a few years and I already miss it. The entire cast is fantastic but the real standout here is Simon Baker as Patrick Jane. He was born to play this role. It's about a former ""psychic "" who serves as a consultant for the California Bureau of Investigation. He uses his incredible smarts and observation to solve cases in unusual ways. He's also there to find a killer named Red John, who killed his wife and daughter. If you're looking for a good show that you'll have a lot of fun watching them give this a try, you won't be disappointed!",/review/rw1977746/?ref_=tt_urv

","Out of the thousands of police procedural shows to choose from I have to say that The Mentalist is one of my favorite! It has everything you want in a good police show...drama, action, comedy, suspense, etc. Simon Baker is absolutely perfect as Patrick Jane as he leads an all around great cast!",/review/rw1977746/?ref_=tt_urv

9 April 2009,cosmic_quest,8," So far, so good...
","'The Mentalist' is the latest American crime drama to make its way to British shores and so far, it is proving itself to be a promising show which will hopefully continue to flourish. The show revolves around Patrick Jane, a mentalist (someone with a highly developed sense of observation who can give the illusion that they have psi abilities) with a haunted past, who uses his unique skills to help the California Bureau of Investigation solve crimes.",/review/rw1977746/?ref_=tt_urv

","I thought I'd buy other DVDs of other shows and movies first (the x-files, Mad Men) but I gladly got every season separately of THE MENTALIST, Later, I bought the X-Files yet haven't got Mad Men (too grim)(the 60s told from a rich white viewpoint and getting a lot of details wrong - the real soundtrack to the 60s was the uber-expensive-to-use-as-background-music Beatles, Simon&Garfunkel, Hal David/ Burt Bacharach, and Bob Dylan with the Beatles constituting 70 o/100 all music played on earth from 1964-1970, race riots were a part of summer from 65-70 in every major Northern city, and there was only one gay character.

17 October 2019,arindamdas-41892,10," More than just a show. Something that's gonna stay with you for a long time....
","I don't normally write reviews but i have to for this gem. First of all if you're in dilemma of deciding whether should watch it or not then put your doubts aside and give it a go, you will not regret it . This is one of the best show I have ever seen.
The story is very well written and it's surpassed only by the acting of the cast involved. Simon Baker's performance in The Mentalist is nothing short of spectacular, he brought the character of Patrick Jane to life. A well balanced protagonist that is smart, sexy and have a good sense of humour, plus Patrick's background story is so emotionally strong that you can't help yourself to connect with it in a deeper way.
The chemistry between Simon Baker and Robin Tunney's character is portrayed so well by these two, and their amazing friendship off-screen is reflected on the show in a wonderful way. Jane and Lisbon's relationship is truly one of the most beautiful relationships ever written for TV. But, it's not just them you feel attached to. You'll get fascinated by the tricks of a Mentalist. He is witty, sarcastic, arrogant at times, manipulative and extremely intelligent with an extraordinary IQ and memory. He is gonna trap you into his wide skills of observation, manipulation, cold reading, mind bending tricks & ideas. The way he solves the cases is magnificent to watch and so so intriguing. I can ever go as far as to say that his intelligent surpasses that of Sherlock Holmes. This guy can literally get inside the minds of the smartest & the toughest criminals and manipulate them to do things his way. He can get inside Joker's head and make him commit suicide, yes you heard it right. Such is the mind of a brilliant man, Patrick Jane, the main protagonist. You're gonna love him every single moment of the show.
Won't give you any spoilers or anything but a great show needs a great antagonist, & it can't get any better than Red John. From the suspense regarding his true identity, to the mind games between him and Patrick, all of it is presented so well to keep you intrigued for the entire course of show. And even after Red John this show is a delight to watch.
And I dare say that I have finally found a show with the PERFECT ENDING. A show can not get a better closure than this . The only thing sad about the ending was the fact in itself that the show was ending. Now it's hard for me to imagine a day without watching The Mentalist. It's gonna stay with the watcher forever.
Thank you Bruno Heller for giving us this masterpiece.",/review/rw1977746/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2008,GonzoBarbossa,8," A show that is so much more than it seems.
","For anyone who thinks this is close to Psych...you're dead wrong. While both shows take a similar premise, they're so different in many ways. This show does have a man with the ability to spot minute details, but he does so much more, he plays mind games with people, reads their emotions and sets elaborate traps to catch them. Many compare him to Shawn Spencer of Psych, but I would rather compare him to Sherlock Holmes, except more tortured. The pilot obviously takes on a more serious approach than Psych and the dynamics of the show go from cute and funny to deeply disturbing in seconds.",/review/rw1977746/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2022,disisdkat,10," I love this show
","I had given the show a 9 because I really hated the Red John thread but I have now re-watched it from start to finish and I love every bit of it. I had never seen the last season which to me to is best of all of them. I generally dislike shows that have the main characters fall in love and pair up. Castle did it as has many others and they simply drop in quality when they do so. Not The Mentalist. What a wonderful way to end a series. Now when I think of the show I just feel good. TV has a way of ruining shows at the end one way or another. I am grateful this did not happen with my favorite long running show. Thank you to the writers, directors, producers, actors and all those involved.",/review/rw1977746/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2009,mjmdl,10," Enjoyable Crime Solver
","I really like the show and it's actors. It stars a man who had a career acting as a psychic who was just pretending for the money. He made the mistake of catching the attention of a serial killer who retaliated by killing his family. He recovered from a breakdown and now works as a consultant to help the bureau catch the ""bad guy"" by using those same intuitive, observant skills and really listening to what people do and don't say. Simon Baker plays quite a multifaceted character that goes from playful to serious, whichever is called for and does it very well. The Mentalist has a good blend of being neither too dark like Criminal Minds or too lightweight like Psych, shows which I also watch.",/review/rw1977746/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2020,lewismom-59557,10," Unique, great plots, humor, action, great characters
","One of the best shows I've ever seen, this series has it all: countless surprising plot twists, humor, long satisfying story arcs, well-drawn characters who change and grow, murders, action, revenge, pathos, more humor, quotable & memorable dialog, suspense, multiple romantic story lines... everything. Characters are likable but complex. Locations and plots are varied and interesting. Never a dull episode, and unlike many series, the final episodes offer a satisfying conclusion. My family and I have watched the entire series together three times, it's that good.",/review/rw1977746/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2019,Phil_Chester,," Characters you relish spending time with
","What I love about 'The Mentalist' is that it's a cop procedural show where the characters are so much more important than the solving of the crimes. I relish spending time with these people. Every one of them feels so well drawn and realised. Simon Baker was born to play Jane. The stories are packaged up in easily digestible bite-sized chunks, so you can dip in and out whenever the mood takes you. Highly recommended.",/review/rw1977746/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2008,vagabondjonson,," Intriguing
","I've only seen about four of five episodes of this show and I liked it, but as others have said, it follows a rather familiar vein. Trying not to compare it to anything else though, I found it to be enjoyable at face value. The lead character is likable and keeps the interrogations and methods of discovery light and conversational which is nice. I like that his part isn't really dark and sinister, which was an avenue obviously available to the writers given the main character's back story.",/review/rw1977746/?ref_=tt_urv

29 June 2022,mkup04-254-935900,8," Binge worthy
","I love this show... the Patrick Jane character is the best. Trying to figure out who Red John was, was fun! I used to think it was his boss! I remember rooting for Patrick and Teresa from the beginning but was a little disappointed when they did. His profession of love was more passionate than there relationship throughout the 7th season. You don't see them really embrace. When Vega dies, instead of really consoling her he touches her shoulder from across a counter. I am still glad the couple got together, but would have loved to see more from them.",/review/rw1977746/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2018,Kirpianuscus,," Simon Baker
","His job is admirable. not surprising. because it is nuanced portrait of a familiar character. but profound original. it start as story of revenge. and it remains a one -like. but the first traits of sketch are more and more full of colors and nuances. a crime serie. who must you see. first, for the art of Simon Baker to propose the right character and the right manner to propose, in each episode, a new surprise.",/review/rw1977746/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2022,pavelfomitchov,10," I would never expect that I will watch all episodes many times!
","I'm not sure that I can explain this, but this is the first time on my life when I watched all 150 episodes more than 3 times. There is something really special about this serial that keeps me thinking about it and watching it again. Yes, it is another version of Sherlock Holmes. Yes, I can see the patterns in the plots of multiple episodes, but still I'm on the hook. Unbelievable mix of great stories, wide range of emotions, social circles, intellectual clues, excellent acting and unexpected turns of the action. I'm glad that I can discover more and more interesting details every time when I watch it. Finally, I would never guess that watching a criminal drama will make me calm and relaxing after another crazy day:-)",/review/rw1977746/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2008,cchase,8," Great Start For THE MENTALIST
","Okay, first let's get this out of the way, shall we? I've already heard the naysayers griping about how this is a blatant rip-off of USA's series PSYCH. And you know what I think? I think that's an insult...to THE MENTALIST. I have seen at least one episode of PSYCH, and I have one question...WHY would you defend that show? It's horrible! I gave it one chance to impress me, especially since the episode I saw featured one of my favorite actors, Tim Curry, as a special guest star. I don't know who I was more embarrassed for - poor Tim for choosing to make that appearance, or for myself having to watch him slog through it.",/review/rw1977746/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2008,tianxiafengyung,7," Great show with a lot of potential
","The lead character Patrick Jane (Simon Baker) aka the 'Mentalist' plays a 'psychic' consultant for a serious crime unit headed by Lisbon (played Robin Tunney, ""Prison Break"") along with the rest of the cast, Cho (Tim Kang ""Rambo""), Van Pelt (Amanda Righetti, ""OC"") and Rigby (Owain Yeoman ""Nine""). But Patrick is no psychic, he relies upon acute observation and a penchant for playing mind games with the 'suspects' (and other members of the unit)to solve the case.",/review/rw1977746/?ref_=tt_urv

","I love to watch this series especially the character ""Mr. Jane""; it's mind blowing his style mannerism is excellent. He perfectly fitted in that role and I became big fan of him.

19 November 2008,Chi3_16,9," intelligent new show
","The mentalist is no doubt not an original concept, and yes, it might be somehow related to Psych. The show does distinguish itself from Psych with its new and unrelated material. The series literally takes you on a ride as one feels involved in the investigations with every episode. The haters of the show should ease up. This is good old detective work, which relies on careful crime scene observation and a bit of suspect manipulation, as oppose to the science ridden crime dramas which bombard our television sets every evening. No disrespect to C.S.I. One more thing that struck me, has anyone else noticed the number of 24 alumni appearing on the show?? Up until episode 7, we have had 4 alumni, Steve Culp, Xander Berkeley,Gregory Itzin and Leslie Hope. I wonder who is coming up next........ Catch the show for its wit and fun, if not.....check it out to see if Jack Bauer shows up to help The Mentalist.....",/review/rw1977746/?ref_=tt_urv
