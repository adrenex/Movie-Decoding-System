21 September 1999,squir1y,," Hilarious!
","This movie is one of my favorite comedies. One of the funniest I've ever seen. My favorite parts are where the psycho crossing guard guy who is obsessed with Star Trek is stalking Reggie. It's too bad they don't call movies like these classics, if they did, teenagers would rule the film industry. Check it out. 10/10",/review/rw3197797/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2002,thenexusone,10," Perfect for a relaxing laugh.
","I was overly joyed when I saw the trailers for Senior Trip.  It appeared to be a very good no brainer for a 90 minute laugh.  Unfortunately it wasn't well taken to by movie-goers which made its release to vhs very slow and limited.  It hasn't even made it to dvd yet and I know of terribly worse comedies that have, and most are from the present Saturday Night Live Crew. The film does fulfill the area of not only certain high school hijenks, but also a human feeling for the kids of that specific time.  It pushed through the ideas of free alcohol, drugs but not so much sex.  There was the element of sex, in words and conversation, but no real nudity or fulfillment. Overall an excellent film that would have done better a few years later when teen flix came back with a vengeance.  Senior Trip carries with it the National Lampoon feel of Animal House, but doesn't veer off into a demented spoof like Not Another Teen Movie.  It filled the void where drama and action films had worn away movie goers in the mid 90s.  Watch for Tommy Chong as the bus driver and the chemistry, whether electrified or jaded between the characters.",/review/rw3197797/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2008,lee_eisenberg,6," ""Forrest Humps"" might be a neat idea for a movie
","I should say that ""Senior Trip"" is mostly one of the silly comedies that they released in the 1990s (of course, it was intended as such). I guess that on one level, it has an important lesson about paying attention to what happens in the government. In my opinion, the best parts were some of the briefer things: the guy chasing the bus, J. Edgar Hoover's grave*, the porno movie in the hotel room, and the epilogues. Otherwise, this isn't the sort of movie that you'd go out of your way to watch. Although I have to admit, Matt Frewer (who turns 50 today) and Tommy Chong play great characters.",/review/rw3197797/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2017,sol-,7," Trip with the Teacher
","Invited to meet the President of the United States, a group of high school seniors try to make the bus trip as exciting as possible, much to the anguish of their easily irate principal, in this lively comedy starring Jeremy Renner long before his Oscar nomination for 'The Hurt Locker'. The film is weighed down by heavily stereotyped characters (geek, slob, smart girl, prissy young teacher, etc) and at least a third of the gags backfire, but the ones that work are very, very funny thanks to great comic timing from all concerned. Matt Frewer is particularly energetic as the stuffy principal and Lawrence Dane is perfectly vile as a corrupt senator, while Tommy Chong is a lot of fun playing pretty much himself as the bus driver. There is also a wonderfully uncanny subplot involving a 'Star Trek' fanatic who believes that he has a mission to stop the bus arriving at its destination. The film additionally features two hilarious fake movies: one, a 1950s style film about contraception; the other, a pornographic version of 'Forrest Gump'! Oddly enough, the film does not really offer any real ideas regarding the future of education given that the students are traveling to Washington to discuss such matters, but this is a bubbly comedy first and foremost and an enjoyable one at that with Frewer even nicely learning how to bond with his students along the way.",/review/rw3197797/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2004,avelitchev,," A great and very personal movie for me

9 March 2005,bellhollow,1," Not worthy of a National Lampoon Title
","This is a really, really bad movie which explains the Alan Smithee direction. The premise was good but this is a movie for children who have never seen Animal House, Airplane, or the Naked Gun. Because this movie goes nowhere fast is an understatement. The only funny scenes involved the guy from New Kids in the Hall playing with his Star Trek blow up doll. But aside from that, we have a bunch of kids drinking and puking and not much of anything else. Do not watch this movie. Even the ending was STUPID!! I still don't understand how people can make movies stink so bad. They could have had more scenes with the principal and the typing teacher but that would have involved lesser known actors so that they would have taken their clothes off. Or they could have had the students actually catch the bad congressman having sex with one of the students. I can not reiterate how awful this movie is. I sat there waiting for something funny to happen and even waited for ending hoping something would salvage this painstaking road I had wondered down. Instead I felt like I had watched a movie that will barely keep anyone's attention under the age of ten.",/review/rw3197797/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2018,hellraiser7,8," Wild Field Trip
","This film is one of my honorable mentions of school comedies, it's also another comedy that passed under the radar, like a student passed by a bus. I really got into this movie in the latter part of my adolescence and was looking into crude/teen comedies which were starting to become more frequent in the mid to late 90's. This film you could say is pretty much ""Animal House"" but in High School, I think that's makes sense going this direction just as ""Animal House"" parodied/satire a little on students and their subculture in Collage, this does it for teen and their subculture in High School.",/review/rw3197797/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2008,aesgaard41,7," Almost Funny Teen Movie
","On one level, this is a really horrible movie that tries to make heroes out of slackers, potheads and social rejects, but on another more subliminal level, the kids in this movie are like the largest comedy team ever seen. They're not funny, they're interesting to watch. Jeremy Renner is the ringleader, an under-achiever who has accepted his limitations and blindly corrupts logic to break the rules. He should have been a break out star, but the direction doesn't explore his comedic chops and he is forced to mug, grimace and cow tow to the rest of the cast. The true funny presence to watch is character-actor Kevin MacDonald as the psycho Trekkie with a chip on his shoulder who wants to takeout Renner's character for years of psychological abuse; he's the one to watch here as he goes through abuse after abuse and realizes the things he learned from ""Star Trek"" don't help him in the real world. Matt Frewer is wasted as an exasperated, harried and frustrated principal stuck in one mode as the kids push him over the end; he's pretty much the kids patsy and victim from one end of the movie to the other. Eric Edwards plays a forced Belushi clone: an sleepy yet vice-driven imbecile without morals, but without any of the charm, humor or presence of John or Jim Belushi. (To see him now, you'd never expect he was the same actor!) Tommy Chong is stuck in the same one-joke clich√© role he plays in every movie: a conspiracy-talking pothead who is his own worst enemy. It's a shame he's written off so early; investigating his life would have been more interesting. My favorite character is Carla Morgan played by Tara Charendoff; she oozes sex and kittenishly moves through the movie possessed by Marilyn Monroe showing off the full range of her acting ability. The plot is weak; it runs like a documentary of high school rejects attached to a loose sequence of comedic criminal events and unfunny disasters filled with a huge cast of unknowns. Only Charendoff and Nicole DeBoer would go on to any greater success. It lacks the spirit of ""Animal House,"" the humor of John Landis or the commentary of Harold Ramis, and yet, you wonder what sort of damage these kids could do somewhere else and there, there is the one saving point of this film that you wonder what happens to them next.",/review/rw3197797/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2007,kayabound,3," Tommy Chong, Tara Strong and Nicole de Boer
","I really wanted to like this movie, but I could only come up for 3 reasons to suggest anyone else endure this movie. Tommy Chong, Tara Strong and Nicole de Boer. Quite frankly, Chong isn't enough of a reason since he can be seen in better form in a dozen other choices and de Boer is a minor player at best. You are better off watching the last few seasons of Deep Space Nine to be mesmerized by Nicole. So that leaves us with Tara. Yes, Tara is enough of a reason to watch this movie... once. Only because it is the only movie in existence that she is in as a physical entity. If you don't know Tara is the voice behind 100s of cartoon characters you probably watch with your kids. The movie has a few funny moments, but they are rare and limited. Tara on the other hand is absolutely gorgeous.",/review/rw3197797/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2021,ben-mckimm,7," Clever comedy dressed up as stupid comedy
",National Lampoon's movies always have layers of comedy. There's the surface level gags like fart jokes and people falling over but underneath that there's always much more going on. It's always worth a second or third watch so you can pay less attention to the in-your-face jokes and more attention to what's going on in the background. Senior Trip is no exception. It looks completely stupid but there's a lot going on. It deserves at least 2 viewings.,/review/rw3197797/?ref_=tt_urv

","Being someone who usually when he has the cash heads to the film theaters alone. I liked this film...the stuffy kid in the suit reminds me of what I possibly could ahve been like had I gone along with stuffy stupid republicans at a similar event. I was involved in the close up foundation and am so glad I lost. This film spoofs those functions. Naturally, this film was not about me or my situation in life (i am different than this character and excell at dressing like a slob and looking like one.) this is a film anyone tied in with student political groups in school could love. The film satires the political ssytem and student ""young"" party groups that are so green they have no concept of what the ssytemis actually like. Foolish kids breast fed on half truths in cirriculum books and the ""90's senastionalism"" news. A great satire on the gen x generation as well. Not as clever as ANIMAL HOUSE but clever enough..yet i am not a film maker and never will be one...who am I to judge.

","As with most films of this type, the movie stands on the shoulders of it's supporting players. The slut, Carla, who immediately checks out the men whenever she walks into the room. The geek, Virus, who plays the piano with his erection. The assassin, Travis, Star Trek fan, manipulator of the young and all around comedy fall guy. These actors are the ones who make us laugh.

8 September 1999,Richard-110,1," I came, I saw, I groaned.
","Although most film critics consider ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" the worst film ever made, I submit that ""National Lampoon's Senior Trip"" was much worse. Without question, it was THE worst film I've ever seen.  It condones and makes a joke out of drug use, and the heroes of the movie are stoned-out students who have complete contempt for authority or students who are interested in academics.  Sorry, but I find nothing funny about a film that relies on juvenile gutter humor and stereotypical clueless authority figures to sell tickets. It was so horrible that I didn't even see the ending.  I didn't have to:  based on the comments I've read, my predictions were right on target. In fact, if predicting endings of pathetic films like this was as easy as predicting the course of the stock market, I could bankrupt Bill Gates. My rating for ""National Lampoon's Senior Trip"":  BOMB!",/review/rw3197797/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2010,Sandcooler,5," Those rowdy teens
","I love how you can spice up virtually anything by putting ""National Lampoon's"" in front of it. It may not mean anything because National Lampoon lends its name to everything that moves, but it always has a nice ring to it. If you can't think of a clever title for your movie, just say what it's about and put ""National Lampoon's"" in front, it always works. The movie itself well, it's nothing special. The same tired stereotypes you see in every college movie go on (you've guessed it) a senior trip to party and cause mayhem and just generally do things that you'd rather do than watch. Meanwhile a ridiculously one-dimensional principal tries to put a stop to this because well, just because. The jokes are pretty stale, and the characters are unlikeable, but I still enjoyed this movie for some reason. It's a pretty good compilation of clich√©s I guess, its strength lies in its predictability. Also Tommy Chong appears, that always helps. Not the best college movie, but still easy to get through.",/review/rw3197797/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2000,Quinoa1984,7," A funny movie, plain and simple
","Some people might not find this movie funny because some might think It's gross or some might not know the actors in the movie.  Well, I think this is a good movie.  It is one of the best National Lampoon movies, and I saw it when I was younger, so it taught me a few things- (Insolen looks like heroin, never smoke a bong after taking 10 reds, to never eat goldfish, and to just have fun).  It is also utterly hilarious, with Tommy Chong being always great as the stoned Red bus driver, and Kevin McDonald, who is drop dead funny as a Star Trek fan who talks to a cardboard spock.  Definately a lot of fun for any teens or Lampoon fans.  Christian conservatives on the other hand, beware.  A+",/review/rw3197797/?ref_=tt_urv

","Having laughed my backside off while still in my teens, continued to laugh my cheeks off with each subsequent viewing in my twenties and now, at the ripe age of 36, having recently split my sides once more on the first viewing in nearly ten years, all I can conclude is that the viewers who conspired to rate Senior Trip (as i will always know it) so badly were clearly watching the wrong kind of film for them. It's perfectly casted, over-the-top, amusingly written and acted and ticks just about every box you want from an occasionally crass teen-comedy... in fact it ticks most boxes twice, and in bold. Do not let the score deceive you. Like Flight of The Living Dead, this is a film I have shared with at least twenty people over the years, of different ages, tastes, backgrounds, genders and religions - and I've not had a single negative response.",/review/rw3197797/?ref_=tt_urv

","NATIONAL LAMPOON'S SENIOR TRIP is one of the most outrageous [and funniest] teen movies ever made. It's about a group of high schoolers who write a complaint letter to the president about education. After reading the letter, the president asks to see the students in person so they go on a field trip to Washington. Half of the movie takes place on the bus, but those are some of the funniest scenes. When the movie finally gets them to Washington, the amount of laughs when down and a lot of them were featured in the theatrical trailer.
