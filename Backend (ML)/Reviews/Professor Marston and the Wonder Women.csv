8 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,9," Terrific!
","I absolutely love 1923! It's right up there with Yellowstone and 1883. If you're a fan of those two then you'll be a fan of this to. It takes the best of both of those shows and combine it for this one. This is definitely a show for adults with all the violence and language it that's what makes it so good. It's not for children. At this point Taylor Sheridan can do no wrong. He hits home run after home run. I love everything about this show...the acting, writing, directing, production, cinematography, etc, etc. Are all excellent. I mean this stars Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren for crying out loud. For those two A-list actors to do a tv show you know it had to be good. I know those two are going to get all the attention, and rightfully so, but there are just so many other great actors in this. Too many to even name. I can't wait to see more of this series and where it goes!",/review/rw8744508/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,9," Does Not Disappoint
","1923 is the next prequel to Yellowstone after 1883 and like those two shows this is just as incredible! As a huge fan of those two shows I was really looking forward to this and it did not disappoint! It continues to follow the Dutton family and show how they created the Yellowstone ranch. This obviously takes place in 1923 during prohibition and the Great Depression. It's another gritty western from Taylor Sheridan. Sheridan is one of the best things going on television right now, everything he touches turns to gold. Just look at his resume (Yellowstone, 1883, Mayor of Kingstown, Tulsa King, Sicario, Hell or High Water, etc.). Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren lead an amazing cast who are all at their best here. I'll be shocked if this show doesn't win numerous awards.",/review/rw8744508/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2022,douglasmcbroom,8," Range War's Already Started
","First, let's talk about Taylor Sheridan. I don't like 'Yellowstone' and stopped watching it when I realized it was a soap opera and not a drama and all of its characters are unlikeable. In the case of the daughter-despicable. I thought 1883 got off to a brilliant start, but lost its way after the halfway point. I thought Sheridan's screenplay for 'Hell or High Water' was fantastic. His screenplay and direction of 'Wind River' was outstanding. I love 'The Mayor of Kingstown' and I'm really liking 'Tulsa King.' So, it's a mixed bag.",/review/rw8744508/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2022,A_Different_Drummer,8," Some of you will love this. And some won't
","Most reviews are about content. Sometimes, the exception to the role, you have to peek behind the camera. This is one of those times. Taylor Sheridan has quietly evolved into Hollywood's #1 ""golden boy."" Sheridan has active been in the industry for less than a decade, and has already demonstrated the ability to write, direct, produce and even act (Sons of Anarchy). He has earned 24 awards out of 57 total nominations. Most importantly, he is the creator behind the massively popular Yellowstone franchise and its knockoffs -- of which 1923 is merely the latest. Knowing that this show was destined to be a hit, the producers doubled down on their reputation for idiosyncratic casting, putting both Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren in the leads. The chemistry not only works, it is brilliant. That said, there are tricks and tropes in 1923 which hint that Sheridan is still experimenting with his scripts (the safari scenes, the exaggerated violence) -- and refuses to fit into any reviewer's preconceived notions or expectations. Good for him. Some viewers will eat that up. And some won't. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

10 January 2023,housearrestedever,9," Better and...BETTER!
","So far, this series has gone to Episode 4 and has become more and more intense like what we have seen and experienced in Yellowstone, the up-to-date Kevin Costner, the latest generation of the Duttons. We have seen the similar scene when the survived one buried her loved one on the mountainside. We've also seen that in the 1920s', the similar wounded Dutton and the latest Dutton, both were ambushed and almost died. The great. Taylor Sheridan has smartly used the same fate and situation that the Duttons inevitably have to face and deal with. The eras may different, but what happened just kept happening.",/review/rw8744508/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2022,garywrght756,10," I want to love this
","As a Scotsman there is nothing more excruciating and gnawing as listening to a failed attempt at a Scottish accent. Who cast Jerome Flynn as a Scotsman, Mel Gibson? Are there no Scottish actors or is it impossible to do a Scottish accent. I love everything about this whole universe but the Scottish accent makes me angry as if anyone thinks that sounds authentic then they've never met anyone from Scotland. I've still given this a ten as I love it still and with it being the wild west I'm sincerely hoping that someone will shoot him in the throat and relieve my ears of the butchering of my on tongue. Sort this out as it is insulting to all the Scots that helped build America.",/review/rw8744508/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2022,nonsensefans,10," Brandon Sklenar as Spencer Dutton is the best character of all !
","Beautiful scenes as Yellowstone, the cow, the horses, cowboys & all but we've seen it all already in Yellowstone. What attracts me to this show is when this young alike Indiana Jones character called Spencer Dutton plays by a good looking Brandon Sklenar gets all actions , thrilling scenes with lions/ leaopard in Africa. I wish Brandon gets a standalone series or something just him & the lions & his adventures. Harrison Ford the lead , amazing as always , then I also saw James Badge Dale but his name not in opening theme not sure why. So far the storyline are well paced, I am looking forward to see more of the story of this Duttons family.",/review/rw8744508/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,regularhero-162-380653,10," Sheridan does it again!!
",I didn't think 1883 could be topped but this is running it close already. It could already be the show of 2023 and we are only in January.,/review/rw8744508/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,reggiemiller-59077,10," So far this is the best show on TV!
",This is in my opinion better than Yellowstone and the best show on television right now. Every character in the show is great. The storyline and the writing are spectacular. Yellowstone is good but to me it has gotten a little far fetched for my taste but this show so far is flawless. You will fall in love with all the characters. It also has that old western feel to it that makes westerns so much fun. Almost has like a Tombstone feel to it or something. Anyway I am looking forward to where this is going to take us. If they keep it up maybe we'll have somebody of Dutton saga all year round....,/review/rw8744508/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2022,dhampton2750,9," Helen miren is a fox
","Helen Miren is an amazing actress. Tyler Sheridan is a genius. He keeps creating outstanding entertainment I can't wait to see what is next. I like how the scenery is center stage. The back story and character development is fabulous. I enjoy seeing the evolution of the Dutton family in parallel to America. There are several stories intertwined which make less than A list actors hugely important to the series. The emphasis on the plight of native Americans is just right. No politics, just perspective. Tyler doesn't go heavy on politics but give a great view of what it might have been like for natuve people. This series along with 1883 and Yellowstone give us a glimpse of what true freedom looks like.",/review/rw8744508/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2022,carolyn-lazar,10," Except
","I'm very sure the general public is ignorant about the Indian Boarding Schools that were rampant throughout the West during that time period and were run by churches and our government. The Heard Museum in Phoenix has an excellent display of the horrors that we subjected Native Americans to in order to assimilation them. Taylor Sheridan is just referencing real history. If you think it's horrible, good. It was. That's how white people treated Native Americans then. As to the character of the young girl, Teonna, I believe she will be the ancestor of Chief Rainwater in Yellowstone.",/review/rw8744508/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2022,MoistMovies,9," The Sheriff from SOA, to creating the greatest modern western over 3 series.
","And the first time Harrison Ford has tried in along long time. And his first TV series. Just like Taylor Sheridan has gotten Stallone to act in his first series in 'Tulsa king' which so far is a perfectly paced crime drama that isn't too heavy and still keeps the cowboy feeling to it.. there's never been a crime Mafia series set in cattle/cowboy country like it and it has Stallone like Ford, putting his all for his age, into the performance. Even tho many shots are obviously not Stallone with the character he's talking to, but using doubles. 5his has become significantly more obvious since the pandemic... actors wanting less interaction with lots of people makes it easier when his driver is talking to him and you can only see a half back of the head of Stallone. This happens in many conversational part of the series with him. But he chews the scenery everytime he's alone and has admitted in interviews doing a tv series is the most demanding and tiring he's ever felt working. Which from the guy that played Rambo.... that says alot about what Mr Sheridan expects from his lead cast. I highly doubt he'd hire Harrison Ford if he was going to play bored old man like he has for 3 decades of film. I feel like he's going to leave this series as his acting legacy. And with James Marigold directing the new Indiana Jones, the same guy that made Logan and got the best performance from the two older leading cast members. I mean since then, is sad so see Patrick Stewart in the newtrek destroyed by A.kurztman...nwith his acting being horrible compared to Logan.",/review/rw8744508/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2023,Giannis34,10," Lives up to expectations
","This has been a great show ever since the very first episode. The cast looks like something from a summer blockbuster, not a television show. You can tell they've put a lot of money into this and have gotten the most of their production value. The actors also all do a great job as they bring this story to life. This is a show where you can't be playing on your phone, cooking dinner or doing something else, it requires your undivided attention. If you do that then I promise you won't get bored and have a good time watching this. I've been lost in the story since the beginning and can't wait to see what happens next.",/review/rw8744508/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2023,frannysklenar,10," ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!
","After ready comments. I do want to say 1923 has everything to do with the story line from 1883 and also in the future Yellowstone. People who say they dont get how the relate, well sorry for you,, but you just dont get it.. Africa story line and all of Spencer's adventures are him escapeing his own torment, what dont you get.. about Spencer and his running from his own pain. PTSD! I GET IT 100%. Helen Merrin is the best I've seen her. The story lines for all the characters is awsome. My favorite is Spencer and Alex's love story. Its so real. Their totally opposites, but know each other so well. Brandon Sklenar is great in this role, as (Spencer) a very humble-troubled young man with thoughts of the war he fought and how it hunts him. You really feel for him watching his pain. Alex is a girl after my own heart. Very smart, had a mind of her own. I love it. Their a great story, that needs in my opinion to end the story together and happy. After all the tragedies of ""1883"" and ""Yellowstone "". 1923 needs to end on a good note! An excellent show. So far1923 is the best of all them! I love it!!!!!",/review/rw8744508/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2023,fransklenar,10," Another Hit!
","GREAT, LOVED IT. Every episode gets better and more exciting. Every character has a great story and they connect with 1883 and Yellowstone (in the future). My favorite is Spencer, how he's so broken from the war. He lost himself and its so obvious Cara (Helen Miren) his aunt has great love and respect for him and what he went through. She depends on him now in a way she knows he'll get things done in winning their range war when he gets home. I hope his story line continues with Alex, they have such good chemistry. After all they have been through , I hope there together and happy in the end of all of this!!!!",/review/rw8744508/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2022,brandoncallen-58930,7," Good for the most part
","Sorry need to just say right out of the gate that people need to keep their politics out of reviews. Who cares if the actors are repubs or dems in their personal.life it's about the acting. The acting was pretty damned good, expecially Helen Miren she is one of the all time best. Supporting casts was good enough. Ok so two needless situations in my opinion. One, the Catholic father beating the nun for beating the student. And two, the Africa story line is completely unnecessary. The black sheep of the family could be in a hundred different locations why Africa? Also not every cowboy was a badass danger seeking bad boy. For the most part I liked it and hope it ends up being as good as 1883.",/review/rw8744508/?ref_=tt_urv

","This series is beautifully Written. It is one of the most tragic Stories I have ever watched. It is definitely It is full of suspense & uncertainty. Despite the tragic events these characters
endure you'll find they still have the ability to love, no matter thick their skin is, all the while fighting to stay alive. It's hard for me to explain how this made me feel. All I can say is, with everything that we have going on today It doesn't compare to ""Anything"" that they went through. Watching this series I was able to feel Is they're Struggle and feel their pain. It definitely made me reflect on my life and the things that I've had to face it doesn't compare. There's so many great characters in this series I have many favorites.",/review/rw8744508/?ref_=tt_urv
