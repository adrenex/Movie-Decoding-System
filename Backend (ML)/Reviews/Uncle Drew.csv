18 February 2005,BrandtSponseller,10," As good as the original, with exciting new directions and room for a sequel!
","Shortly after a number of strange cases begin to appear at the hospital where Ana (Sarah Polley) works, a bizarre zombie ""epidemic"" hits the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area full force. Sarah escapes her immediate threats and meets a number of other humans who decide to seek shelter inside a large shopping mall. As they learn that the zombie outbreak is much more widespread than anyone could have imagined, their chances of survival grow increasingly dim.",/review/rw0920038/?ref_=tt_urv

17 May 2021,masonsaul,8," Surprisingly great remake
","Dawn of the Dead is a great remake that's funny, tense and emotional whilst also skillfully managing to stand on its own two feet. Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, Michael Kelly and Ty Burrell are all great. Zack Snyder's direction is excellent, really kinetic and visceral. The music by Tyler Bates and the soundtrack are both really good. However, it's brought down slightly by the ending (after the credits).",/review/rw0920038/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2004,Cube_TX,7," Action rather than horror, but worthy remake
","As a HUGE fan of the original Dawn of the Dead I was very skeptical of this remake.  I wasn't expecting an Academy Award winning blockbuster or anything, but I did want to see the remake do the original justice.  I was impressed with the filming more than anything.  This is an action movie rather than horror.  The outdoor scenes are filmed with a grainy, hand-held camera which gave the audience the feeling of being disoriented much the same way the characters would have felt.  The movie was not made in the MTV-generation style that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake was.  Dawn of the Dead stuck to the same mythology of the first without giving it a complete reimagining.  I could imagine the two movies co-existing, but in different parts of the world.",/review/rw0920038/?ref_=tt_urv

3 July 2021,k844140,7," Good zombie movie
","It is always risky to shoot a remake of the film which started the genre (well, it wasn't the first film about zombies, but the first which resembles recent ones), and Zack Snyder succeeded in it. Why is it risky and hard? Because the film which starts the genre always sets some rules which all the films of this genre follow. In this film we see absolutely the same as in other zombie movies, whether they are new or old ones: people try to save themselves from zombies, conflict and get bitten. Very frequent trick is also showing that people are bigger monsters than zombies, which is also present in this movie. By the way, because of some bad security guys which appear in the beginning of the movie, I first thought this will be a cliche zombie movie. And though sometimes it is, it has numerous strong sides. Actors are pretty good and their characters are diverse. Here we have strong woman nurse character, a couple of freak guards, one of which saves everyone in the end, young couple of teens who want to be inseparable, interesting sniper Andy, responsible policeman, weird man who ties his pregnant zombie wife to give birth to a zombie child and rich selfish guy Steve. This different characters are quite well represented and you understand every one of them, though there is a lot of characters and film is not that long. This is due to a decent script for a zombie horror. My favorite characters are Sarah Polley's and Ving Rhames' ones. The plot is quite gripping in the end, and basically film gets more and more interesting each 20 minutes. Beginning is a typical zombie horror opening, but in the end due to good character development and some interesting moments it gets much better. Directing of Snyder is decent enough in this film as well. Thanks for the R rating which made film more realistic.",/review/rw0920038/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2004,bryandeth316,9," In a world of bad remakes, this wasn't bad.
","I went into this movie completely excited. And I wasn't even really disappointed either. The acting was very good, and I actually loved how they didn't follow the exact storyline. They took the basics of the original Dawn of the Dead and made it more contemporary. I knew they wouldn't be filming the movie at Monroeville Mall (the mall just 15 minutes outside of Pittsburgh where they filmed the original) but it was still awesome none the less.

","I'm a Romero nut (for those among you who don't know the name George A. Romero: that was the genius writer/director who single-handedly created the modern zombie film and who also wrote and directed the original 'Dawn of the Dead' in '78), so you may believe me when I say I wasn't impressed when I heard there would be a remake of the zombie maestro's famed horror classic. Truth be told, I was absolutely determined to hate this new film when it came out - but boy, was I in for a pleasant surprise!",/review/rw0920038/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2007,poolandrews,6," In my opinion not as good as the '78 original, nowhere near.
","Dawn of the Dead starts just like any other ordinary day for nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) as she goes home after another long shift, she & her husband Luis (Justin Louis) go to bed & have a good nights sleep. The next morning Luis is woken by Vivian (Hannah Lochner), their next door neighbours young girl, who proceeds to bite Luis on the neck. Ana manages to push Vivian out of the room & locks the door, Luis dies in front of her but suddenly comes back to life & attacks Ana in the same frenzied way Vivian attacked him. Ana climbs out of the bathroom window & sees complete pandemonium outside as the dead are returning to life & attacking the living, Ana gets into her car & speeds off but ends up crashing. She is found by a cop named Kenneth (Ving Rhames) who in turn find a guy named Michael (Jake Weber) along with Andre (Mekhi Phifer) & his pregnant wife Luda (Inna Korobkina) who all decide to head to the local shopping mall to find safety. They break in & watch in horror as the streets outside become overrun by flesh eating zombies while the TV news broadcasts offer little hope, if any...",/review/rw0920038/?ref_=tt_urv

12 March 2005,Buddy-51,7," pretty good though not up to the original
","""Dawn of the Dead"" is a remake of the George Romero film from 1978, which was itself a sequel to his 1968 classic, ""Night of the Living Dead."" This new version, written by James Gunn and directed by Zack Snyder, follows the original storyline fairly closely, centering on a group of people who are holed up in a local shopping mall while flesh-eating zombies wreak havoc on the world outside.",/review/rw0920038/?ref_=tt_urv

",Let's get something out of the way first and that is as a director George A Romero is way down there with Ed Wood . The technical aspects like editing and sound are awful while his cast are so wooden you'll get splinters from picking up a DVD of one of his films .,/review/rw0920038/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2004,MovieAddict2016,," OK remake if you're in the mood for a brainless action picture -- but little else.
","The 2004 Dawn of the Dead is sort of a poor man's version of the 1978 original by George A. Romero, which isn't to say it doesn't deliver the goods in terms of gore, but it has little going on upstairs. It's the equivalent of choosing Paycheck over Total Recall  both films are based on short stories by late sci-fi author Philip K. Dick, but only the latter of the two movies actually amounted to anything memorable and thought-provoking.",/review/rw0920038/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2016,Leofwine_draca,6," A different enough remake to be a success
","When I heard that this loose remake of the Romero classic was scripted by the guy who also did SCOOBY DOO, I cried. Then I went to the cinema to see for myself (no matter what reviews might say, it's always worth checking out movies for yourself; sometimes you might be pleasantly surprised). As it stands, DAWN OF THE DEAD is an acceptable remake-cum-horror-thriller which uses the original film as a basis for the story and then moves on from there. Luckily, it's not too similar to the '70s classic; half the film is set in the mall and the rest is an extended chase between humans and zombies. The zombies here are quite good although, I have to say, I prefer the slow-moving variety to the animalistic killers in this and 28 DAYS LATER. Special effects have progressed to a grimly realistic level and the film is packed with enough grue and gore and spraying blood to please any avid horror fan.",/review/rw0920038/?ref_=tt_urv
