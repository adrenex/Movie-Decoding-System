2 April 2016,bkoganbing,8," Gets better with age
","Although young Michael B. Jordan has the title role in Creed the film really belongs to Sylvester Stallone. Sly joins an exclusive club of players like Bing Crosby, Paul Newman, and Al Pacino who got two Oscar nominations for playing the same role. In the case of Sly and Newman both aged naturally into the parts of Rocky Balboa and Eddie Felson. It's hard to believe that it has been 39 years since Stallone debuted Rocky Balboa. It's also 39 years between the nominations that Stallone got for Best Actor for Rocky and Best Supporting Actor for Creed.",/review/rw3397755/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2015,LloydBayer,9," With grit, style and substance, Creed goes the distance as an exceptional crowd pleaser.
","History has a strange way of repeating itself. 40 years ago, Rocky Balboa became a household name and turned an unwanted actor into one of the greatest success stories in Hollywood. The fact that Rocky (1976) won three Academy Awards including Best Picture is of little importance compared to the real life struggle behind the making of that film. For Sylvester Stallone, it was a rags to riches story that mirrored his real life struggles to make a decent and honest living. Cut from the same cloth maybe, but Creed is much more than just the seventh installment in the Rocky film franchise. As a no- holds-barred sports drama, this is every bit an exceptional crowd pleaser with a lot of heart, plenty of amusing jabs to the ribs, and an unexpected but emotional haymaker to the gut. And a lot more.",/review/rw3397755/?ref_=tt_urv

","Milking the franchise for everything it's got, Sylvester Stallone returns as Rocky Balboa in the 7th installment in the series. This time, he's smart enough to know he's too old to get into the ring, so he gets some new blood with a familiar name.",/review/rw3397755/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2015,tjgoalie13,9," An Exhilarating Showcase of Talent and Heart.
","Ryan Coogler's Creed delivers on everything that a great boxing film should, and represents a full return to form for Rocky. Directed by superstar in the making Ryan Coogler, and starring powerful performances from Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone the film is amazing. Creed is exhilarating, beautifully acted, while honoring the previous Rocky films lovingly. The film may be a little too familiar at times, but at least approaches it's overused plot lines with a different take.",/review/rw3397755/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's not about winning, it's about hard work, daily dedication and never giving up because new opportunities will come.

25 March 2016,TheFirstExecutioner,9," Much More Than Just a Boxing Movie
","Creed is the 7th installment in the Rocky franchise but this time focuses on Adonis Creed, Apollo Creed's son. He wants to follow in his father's footsteps and is trained by Rocky Balboa himself. More than boxing, this movie really goes into the relationship between Creed and Rocky and how they both support each other when they most need it. Michael B. Jordan is fantastic as Creed. He is so energetic in the boxing scenes and he is even better when his character is being developed. Now we come to Sylvester Stallone as Rocky. In his signature role, he absolutely knocks it out of the park in what may have been his best performance in his career as an actor. He honestly deserves an Oscar for this part. He brought tears to my eyes on multiple occasions and still has the same charm from the old Rocky movies. ",/review/rw3397755/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I wrote my review of ""Rocky Balboa"", I premised an idea that might have been used for an eventual 'Rocky VII' movie. I didn't get it all right, as the character Marie and Rocky Balboa Jr. weren't brought over from that story. But the part I got right had to do with exploring Rocky's growing older, and as this picture goes on to reveal, how he chooses to deal with an illness that will eventually level the former champ.",/review/rw3397755/?ref_=tt_urv

","Despite a very similar plot to the original Rocky, Creed is an incredible continuation that finds new life in the Rocky franchise with an emotional and thrilling film. Michael B. Jordan gives an incredible performance and has fantastic chemistry with Tessa Thompson, who is also incredible and Sylvester Stallone, who is perfect and gives an all time great performance.

31 January 2016,AlsExGal,8," Stallone deserves an Oscar
","I can say with all seriousness that Sylvester Stallone deserves his Oscar, and I didn't believe that the original and rather obvious ""Rocky"" deserved Best Picture Oscar, so I'm not some fan blind to the weaknesses of the series . He was excellent in that film. While some can argue that the Oscar would be a reward for the entirety of the Rocky franchise, I think that Stallone's performance in Creed stands on its own and is wholly deserving of any accolades he receives. His performance of an aging Rocky Balboa coming to terms with his own mortality (and the mortality of his loved ones, like Pauly and Adrian) and dealing with the effects of aging and the realization that he cannot partake in the rigorous boxing world anymore is very heartbreaking and compelling. Without providing any spoilers, the scene in which Adonis Creed and Rocky return to the famous steps from the first Rocky is a very poignant scene.",/review/rw3397755/?ref_=tt_urv

To be fair the Italian stallion isn't really the focus of the story and the story revolves around the son of the late Apollo Creed , a son has it happens he didn't know he had and a son no one else in the universe knew he had apart from the producers of this movie . Did someone say contrived ? How about another word beginning with C - cynical ? Yes that's the word we're looking for . Cynical ",/review/rw3397755/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2019,KeremUlucay,8," CONLAN WINS THE FIGHT, CREED WINS THE NIGHT
","Lets be honest, Creed is so different from any Rocky movie. In the same time it is so loyal to first one. And it feels it is 6th's sequel, we can see the connection. Story is awesome, cast is amazing. Micheal B. Jordan looks so ambitious, as though he has Eye of the Tiger. His motivation is super duper great. On other hand, we have Tessa Thompson. Im so close to fall in love with her, really. Her character has well written. And absolutely, we have the big shot Sly Stallone. There are nothing to say about him. He is just a legend. But if I had to add something, I can say his acting is better than his young version. Being old has a positive effect on him. But in this movie, director is not Stallone, we have a different guy from other Rocky movies. He is Ryan Coogler. He is amazing, Im so thankful to him for making this world so better and creating another great story about these perfect characters. He proves Rocky franchise has built their own universe. There are lots of great references to earlier movies like chicken training, giving some screen time to Adrian and Paulie characters. I shocked when I realised Paulie is dead. He was the only survivor from first Rocky expect Stallone. But in the same time, I was expecting to see some characters like Little Marie or other children of Apollo Creed. Where are they now? Anyway, Creed has great fight scenes, technically they are perfect. And it has very inspiring training scenes. Also this movie has a great humour, I raised a laugh during the ""cloud"" thing. Finally, best thing this movie have is making an incredible final fight and making whole movie is like a new solo movie. And worst thing it have is not creating a so intense villian. This is my second favourite Rocky movie so far. I cant wait for second Creed movie.",/review/rw3397755/?ref_=tt_urv

28 November 2015,stephendaxter,9," A passing of the baton from Balboa to Creed
","Creed is a film that from the trailers can be looked at as a continuation of the Rocky franchise, but it is actually more of a 'Rebirth' for the franchise and a passing of the baton in a way. My experience with the Rocky franchise is limited to half of the first film and bits and pieces of iconic moments and characters, but missing out on the previous Rocky films will not harm your experience with this film. This is definitely not a 'Rocky movie', it definitely stands on its own and the main focus of the film is Adonis Creed. Of course, being in the same universe and featuring the series' main protagonist does lead to many callbacks to the other Rocky films. Now i didn't know the significance of every reference, but i knew enough to know when they were referring to a past event. But these callbacks (apart from the obvious) are not crucial to the plot and really are just there for die hard fans of the series. ",/review/rw3397755/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2015,mtsaska,10," The legend lives on...
","First off let me say that I have been a life long Rocky fan. With that being said I went into this film very cautious as almost the entire cast and crew were brand new. The trailers looked good, but today a good trailer is not necessarily an indicator of a good film. Sylvester Stallone killed it as a much older and more breakable Rocky. Michael B. Jordan's performance was as good if not better than Sly's. I think that from this day forward anytime I see Jordan, I will think of him as Creed and not whatever character he is playing. The story was engrossing and well thought out. The film pays a great amount of respect to the Rocky films while at the same time carving out it's own place in boxing film history. Honestly I have no idea how accessible this film would be to someone who's never seen a Rocky film, but I think the way the story flows it wouldn't be too much of an issue. Again, highly recommended.",/review/rw3397755/?ref_=tt_urv
