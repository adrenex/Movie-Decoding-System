22 September 2012,StevePulaski,8," A possible pioneer
","It pains me to say that I've already heard many people say they will not be seeing Trouble with the Curve because of Clint Eastwood's ""antics"" at the Republican National Convention just a few weeks ago. Their loss. Not being able to separate the man from the actor is something that took me a while to do, but the way some do it now is childish and immature. I wonder if those same people knew Eastwood was a Libertarian/Republican when he was playing ""Dirty Harry."" Hard to believe it has been nineteen years since Eastwood himself acted in a film he has not directed. He lends the camera to Robert Lorenz, who assisted him in directing much of Eastwood's filmography, including Flags of Our Fathers and the acclaimed Best Picture winner Million Dollar Baby. Lorenz's captures screenwriter Randy Brown's simple but uplifting, intimate story of a man's devotion to a game and his brewing reconnection with his daughter he seemingly abandoned at a young age.",/review/rw2937206/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2012,cattjones,8," At Least a Triple
","I normally do not like movies about sports. I love sports; just not movies about sports. That being said, this film was not so much about baseball as it was about a father and daughter relationship. It also touched on how technology has taken over the human element of scouting for players. This film is the complete opposite of Money Ball, where technology actually helps in building a team. Gus Lobel (Clint Eastwood) is an aging scout for the Atlanta Braves who is struggling with his eyesight and the front office has doubts about whether or not he is still up to the job of spotting up and coming talent. Because of this affliction, Gus is a grumpy old man which actually adds a lot of humor to the film. His character kind of reminded me of the character that Eastwood played in Grand Torino. His daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) discovers that her father is having difficulty, reluctantly takes on the roll of caregiver and follows her father on his scouting adventure. Incidentally, she knows more about baseball than probably anyone else in this film. Johnny Flanagan (Justin Timberlake) is an aspiring sports announcer who was scouted by Gus years ago. The relationship that develops between Mickey (named for Mickey Mantle) and Johnny is fun to watch and provides some insight to Mickey's reluctance to develop a serious relationship with any man. Pete Klein (John Goodman) plays the mediator role that brings Mickey and Gus together. I really liked his unyielding devotion and trust to Gus. It was also good to once again see Scott Eastwood (Billy Clark) act alongside his father. They have acted together in several films, and it was good to see them spending some family time together. I think that the entire cast definitely made this film better and I am sure that it will draw young viewers to the theater. I do not think that this film was utterly brilliant, but it was thoroughly entertaining. There were aspects of the film that were totally predictable, but I looked forward to seeing it play out. Director Robert Lorenz may not have hit it out of the park (like he did with Million Dollar Baby), but I think that it is a definite triple play. I recommend that you do not sit on the bench and go out and see this film. I give this film a green light.",/review/rw2937206/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2013,kosmasp,7," Feeling and hearing it
","I didn't think Clint Eastwood would star in a movie he doesn't direct anymore. Actually I never thought he'd star in a movie period. Then again Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake are there to support him. And if you look at it closely it's more an Amy Adams vehicle. Still the daughter-father relationship is explored in major detail here. And it works for the movie as well, even if it sometimes feels a little clichéd.",/review/rw2937206/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2012,patsworld,8," Trouble With The Curve Hits A Solid Home Run
","Clint Eastwood has being a curmudgeon honed to perfection. How refreshing to see a mature actor creating appropriate roles, and not trying to be a plastic version of his - or her, for that matter in many cases - former self playing inappropriately younger parts. He is excellent in this movie. Amy Adams is, as in every film I've seen her in, a total delight. I never was a fan of John Goodman in his earlier years, but the older he gets and the meatier the roles he takes on, the more appreciation I have for him. And Justin Timberlake has a role absolutely meant for him. He is a sexy little hunk, no doubt about it, with personality to spare. Oh, I loved this movie! The exhilaration of baseball, the heart-tugging familiarity of family issues.this one has a lot going for it and I enjoyed each and every minute of it. It's as good as expectations built it up to be. I would advise you not to miss this one!",/review/rw2937206/?ref_=tt_urv

","I liked this one quite a bit even though it borders on predictable and Clint Eastwood portrays exactly the same hard headed, grumpy old man character he did in 'Gran Torino' and 'Million Dollar Baby'. Amy Adams is likable and engaging as his daughter and there is also a more than decent back up cast in Justin Timberlake, John Goodman, Robert Patrick, Matthew Lillard and George Wyner.",/review/rw2937206/?ref_=tt_urv

","With the talents of Clint Eastwood, Amy Adams, Justin Timberlake, and John Goodman you would think you'd be in for a really good movie. Unfortunately, I didn't feel that was the case. It seemed the makers of the film went out of their way to make the film as contrived and formulaic as possible. With the various soap operaish plot elements and stilted dialog I was rolling my eyes in disbelief, especially in the final twenty minutes or so of the film.",/review/rw2937206/?ref_=tt_urv

20 September 2012,BigBudde,8," Great Drama
","A great film for sports fans and non sports fans alike. Great drama and acting by Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams. They really make a believable father and daughter. Justin Timberlake was also good as a washed up pitcher turned baseball scout. It follows a story of a baseball scout (Eastwood) who is getting towards the end of his career, and scouting the potential number one pick for the Atlanta Braves. Eastwood is definitely getting up there but he can still act and plays this part perfectly. The film moves along good, and is enjoyable from start to finish. It has laughs, drams and some romance. Great for a couple or for the family. An added bonus if you're a baseball fan. 8/10.",/review/rw2937206/?ref_=tt_urv

9 June 2013,classicsoncall,7," ""Is that it. Is that all you got?""
","Well I think Mr. Eastwood threw us all a curve ball this time. This isn't so much a movie about baseball as it is about relationships and coming to terms with advancing old age, and there probably isn't a better role model for portraying that realistically than Clint. One thing is sure, Eastwood isn't afraid to film himself in an unfavorable light. There's one scene where he's looking at himself in the mirror and he looks even older than his eighty two years; it was rather shocking to this viewer who has occasion to view a young Rowdy Yates riding the trail in 'Rawhide' every now and then.",/review/rw2937206/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2013,TxMike,," Well-balanced baseball themed movie, Adams and Timberlake play well off Eastwood.
","I grew up in the 1950s and 1960s as a baseball fan, playing some ball and seeing teams like the Dodgers, the Cardinals, the Mets, the Giants, and the Colt 45s play MLB. So seeing this baseball themed movie with a veteran like Clint Eastwood was just a joy. There is little actual baseball playing here, the focus is on scouting. Embedded is the story of a man and the strained relationship with his adult daughter, a high-powered Atlanta lawyer.",/review/rw2937206/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2012,dgefroh,5," Trouble with the curve needs some straightening out
","I'm a big Clint Eastwood fan, and I really like Amy Adams. Justin Timberlake was decent and a likable guy in this movie, so what's the problem? The problem is the story or should I say lack of a decent story. This movie is so predictable that 10 minutes into it you will be able to figure everything out including the ending. I don't understand why Clint Eastwood would accept or take on this role, maybe it's because he gets to be the crabby, hard headed, cigar smoking, never smiling, snarling old timer like he has played so well in previous good movies such as Gran Torino, Million dollar baby, and The unforgiven. Regardless of why he is in this predictable, silly waste of time, the bottom line is that this movie fails in every aspect. This is not a baseball movie, it's not a drama, it's not a romantic comedy, it's truly a waste of what might have been, could of been, or should of been a potential excellent trip into movie magic. I didn't hate this one, but I didn't like it either, I suspect the reason I didn't hate it is because I really do like Clint Eastwood movies and I'll forgive him this one slip.",/review/rw2937206/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2012,lagudafuad,5," Eastwood is not the director here
","""Now get out of here before I have a heart attack trying to kill you."" That is my favorite line from the 80 something Clint Eastwood in this movie Trouble with the Curve. The movie is sport drama, that is kind of predictable and it does drag, that you can actually get up, go to the toilet get back and still not have missed anything. This is Eastwood's first acting role since 2008's Gran Torino and his first acting role in a movie where he is not the director since 1993's In the Line of Fire. ",/review/rw2937206/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2012,seghers,4," Trouble with the Movie
","First, let it be known, I am a huge Clint Eastwood fan. From his Westerns including the amazing ""Unforgiven"" to his startling and touching directorial triumphs including Mystic River, Letters from Iwo Jima, Flags of our Fathers, etc etc. Given his well-earned iconic status, I find it sad that he chooses the brain-dead ""Trouble with the Curve"" as one of his later appearances. The dialog I would put on a par with ""Expendables 2"" which is to say horrendous. Poor Eastwood, Adams, Timberlake, Goodman, and other fine actors are forced to spout ridiculous dialog that seems to have been written by a 10 year old. Watching the film, we found ourselves laughing at the dialog in in appropriate places, paying attention to how poorly made the film was, rather than even following the story. The story seemed to meander around, first being about Eastwood needing some player to start hitting to keep his job... but then they just drop that plot to make it be about something different... then at the end, they bring everything back together again, tying it into a ribbon without any further explanation or emotional investment earned. The baseball is terrible also. The home run hitter guy is obviously not an athlete, much less a ""five tool"" superstar. Other players, who are supposedly at the triple-A level, especially the narrow shouldered, bespectacled player who precedes the slugger in the batting order, are characters more out of ""Bad News Bears"" than a real baseball movie. The peanut vendor turned star situation is too ridiculous to even comment further on. The ending, as contrived as it is, provides a small amount of satisfaction, but even that is spoiled by Lillard's ridiculous overplaying of the villain, and more even more inane and pointless dialog. I hope very much that we see Eastwood in movies more deserving of the status he has earned. ""Trouble with the Curve"" hits a single simply through its stellar cast, but is thrown out trying to stretch it into a double, aiming for far more than the skill of the writers, editors and producer are able to deliver.",/review/rw2937206/?ref_=tt_urv

","Ageing baseball scout Gus (Clint Eastwood) doesn't believe in computers or statistics. He enjoys researching the old fashion way by going to games and watching new talent firsthand. However, Gus is struggling to take care of himself. He doesn't eat well and his eyesight is growing weaker, making it harder to observe the matches. With draft selections approaching, Gus's friend Pete (John Goodman) is worried about an important scouting trip coming up. He can't afford for Gus to make any mistakes with selections so he employs some extra help. He tries to persuade Mickey (Amy Adams), Gus's daughter, to go on the trip with her father. Mickey lives a very separate life to Gus. She works in a law firm surrounded by men and has to work hard for any recognition. However, she knows as much about baseball as Gus does and eventually concedes when she realises her father's instability. Her relationship with Gus shares a bitter past, but she finds relief by coming to know Johnny (Justin Timberlake), a young scout who would have been a great player had he not succumbed to injury.

30 November 2012,writers_reign,8," Three-Base Hit
","If you live in London and read the Evening Standard best ignore what their s0-called critic said and read instead the great reviews on IMDb. It's clear that there was insufficient cgi, S&V, all-round gore and body count for the Standar's cretinous critic. Time the Standard deep-sixed this cat and hire someone who knows his ass from third base movie-wise. Don't get me wrong, this isn't going to be troubling the judges at Oscar time and/or the Festival circuit but then Robert Lorenz isn't Joe Wright; he's a first-time director who realises that most audiences want entertainment not pretentious dross. In short this is our old friend the feel-good movie, sadly in decline of late; if you want to BE pretentious you could call it a Rom-Com with attitude. It's less about baseball than about relationships, father-daughter, man-woman, and it delivers on both. I doubt if I've ever seen Amy Adams give a bad performance and she doesn't break the streak here. Eastwood too is ageing like Jack Daniel's. I'm not saying it'll hold up five, ten years down the line but right now it's a triple play.",/review/rw2937206/?ref_=tt_urv
