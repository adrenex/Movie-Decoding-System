17 November 2022,samog-98289,7," A magnificent prequel series that still holds up today and will never beat the Disney Plus series!
","After re-watching this series more than once I'm going to do my best to keep this spoiler free of my thoughts, what I enjoyed most about the show and the final verdict! This prequel series was so much fun to watch from the beginning, middle and end! Sean Patrick Flanery brings the iconic hero of Indiana Jones to life originally played by the now 80-year-old Harrison Ford who is a charming and charismatic rogue we all know & love! My favourite part upon rewatching this TV show was seeing the grittiness and brutality of the great war during volume 2! Along the way, this younger version of our beloved childhood icon will meet historical figures from the 20th century played by so many celebrities who when you watch at a younger viewing you'll completely forget they were in this! Overall I had heaps of fun watching this series and in 2023 I look forward to rewatching it all over again that's why I'm giving Young Indiana Jones Chronicles a 7/10! Hope you like it just as much as I did!!! XD.",/review/rw8679681/?ref_=tt_urv
