22 February 2020,Calicodreamin,6," Alice slays, as usual
","Alice was her usual badass in this installment in the resident evil franchise. The objective should never be to go in with high expectations, it's all about over the top action with a sprinkling of plot. This fits the bill. The storyline was a bit disappointing because it doesn't have much of a beginning or end, it all just kind of happens. Overall decent acting, good cinematography and zombie action. I thought Alice and Claire had good chemistry, and the newcomers held up as good cannon fodder.",/review/rw7492977/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2021,nosin_jesuskin,7," Better than people give it credit for!
","Ok, hear me out. I'm a big fan of RE 1 and 2, but RE 3 fell flat for me. RE: Afterlife combined the mystery of the first and the cheesy nature of the second. I admit this is far from a masterpiece but it is more enjoyable than Extinction which took itself too seriously. There were a few moments which left me yelling ""What?!"" at the TV, however that is part of the fun. Have a few drinks and laugh at the outrageous nature of this movie. I was thankful that the fixed the issues of number 3 by immediately killing off the clones and removing her lame ass x-men powers. The worst aspect of the movie was Chris Redfield. I was so excited to finally have him on screen and they decided to go with Wentworth?!? His acting was quite good, I was just hoping he would have at least been jacked instead of super skinny. All in all this was lots of fun for a laugh. Don't take it seriously and it's really enjoyable.",/review/rw7492977/?ref_=tt_urv

11 September 2010,CrimsonKingLives,," Did we see the same movie?
","I'll be honest, I went to see this knowing it wouldn't be great. The 3D looked awesome, and I was excited to see Wesker. What I wasn't expecting was a dull, pointless, plot less, horribly-acted cornball ""action"" movie.",/review/rw7492977/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2010,msb-utils,6," no story, but enjoyable
","I liked this compilation of scenes. I liked the soundtrack; I liked the acting; I liked the settings; I liked the effects. As a game, it works greatly. The movie is a sum of chunks of stories. Most of them are action stories. A few are horror stories. Another few are mystery stories. And none of them are connected to each other. They just share common characters.

12 February 2022,Xstal,5," Alice's Afterlife Aggregation...
","A prison breakout's always fun, especially if you're on the run, from multi-tongued mutant defiance, or a hooded giant axe wielding giant. Arcadia's moored just off the shore, if you make it there your safe for sure, just try to avoid the shaded fella, who pulls the strings of Umbrella. If your losing faith with all the confusion, you need to prepare for retribution, where everything you've seen before, is repeated, recycled, churned, turned once more.",/review/rw7492977/?ref_=tt_urv

18 August 2022,lukem-52760,9," An Action-packed Thrill-Ride From Start to Finish
","I loved the first Resident Evil film & consider that one the best of the franchise, & i didn't really enjoy the other sequels that much but recently re-watching them I've decided each entry is good in their own way, well i don't like ""Retribution"" because it drops two of the best characters (Chris & Claire Redfield) as after the Awesome ""Afterlife"" those two are never heard of again? WHY? Where did they go? They were right there at the end of Afterlife!!! Plus Ali Larter & Wentworth Miller were excellent in their roles & was the best part of Afterlife. The two sequels after Afterlife are pointless to me & silly.",/review/rw7492977/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2020,MR-ODIN,," Afterlife
","Resident Evil: Afterlife attempts to take the series back to basics and delivers a campy action film that has fun with the material. In this chapter Alice searches for Claire and her group of survivors of the zombie apocalypse, which were headed for Alaska looking for the infection free zone Arcadia. Wentworth Miller joins the series and gives a strong performance. Additionally, the over-the-top action scenes are quite impressive, and bring a lot of energy to the film. However, things start to fall apart in the last act as the story goes off in some bizarre directions. Yet for a cheesy horror film, Resident Evil: Afterlife is pretty entertaining.",/review/rw7492977/?ref_=tt_urv

23 October 2010,Troy_Campbell,6," Mindless fun.
","This fourth Resident Evil instalment was only ever going to be worth seeing if it featured lots of amusing gore and entertaining action scenes that utilised the third dimension successfully. Evidently, director Anderson must've known this too, because nary a second is wasted on anything else. From the get go we're embroiled in a mass raid on Umbrella's high-tech underground headquarters by dozens of Alice replicates. It's Matrix-y slick, features a massive body count and is a great way to kick off proceedings, even if the CGI is occasionally substandard.",/review/rw7492977/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2010,the-timelord-victorious,1," They should've ended it at the third one. Utter trash.
","I've always enjoyed the Resident Evil movies, I know they're far from being Oscar worthy material, but overall they've been entertaining one way or another. The first was great, Apocalypse was alright, Extinction was great, if not on par with the first. Afterlife however, is just awful. ",/review/rw7492977/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2011,p-stepien,6," Patchwork filmmaking
","Alice (the eternal Mila Jovovich) is back and in multiple copies. Her prime target is the Umbrella Corporation and the now T-virus enhanced Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts). After a full frontal attack the Umbrella base is left destroyed, but the whole batch of Alice clones get blown sky-high, when Wesker manages to fly away unscathed and detonate the plant. Conveniently for the movie the original Alice survives unscathed as a castaway on-board the plane. During a skirmish with Wesker Alice gets injected with a antidote, that turns her back to being human (but somehow she still manages to survive a terrible plane crash unharmed and keeps her over-the-top fighting abilities largely intact). With Wesker dead and Umbrella disposed of Alice returns to the States to search of her friends, who left for sanctuary in Alaska, only to disappear in mysterious circumstances.",/review/rw7492977/?ref_=tt_urv

7 July 2012,BA_Harrison,7," More of the same... so I'm happy.
","Having sat it out for parts two and three, Paul W.S. Anderson returns to the director's chair for Afterlife, the fourth film in the Resident Evil series; rather unsurprisingly, his film is another slick, effects packed horror/sci-fi hybrid with the emphasis on glossy 3D action set-pieces rather than character development or plot progression. As such, the film is unlikely to alter the opinions of those who haven't enjoyed the series thus far, but the rest should have a blast...",/review/rw7492977/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2010,Robert_duder,9," Resident Evil continues once again to bring mind blowing action and Zombie to the very top of the pile
","I guess, although I don't think of it often, the entire Resident Evil Series must be considered one of my favourite series of films of all time. I haven't scored one of them less than a 9 and this is no exception. Its even more mind blowing to think this is based off of a video game series that long before this film series I thought could make a great movie series but no one would ever do it properly but that just isn't so. The entire series packs science fiction, horror, action, thriller into one perfect conglomeration. The story carries throughout and they tie all the ends together while still creating a solid individual story for this film. Resident Evil Afterlife isn't pure artistic brilliance (shocker I know) but it is cold hard entertainment and sometimes that is the best film you can walk into. ",/review/rw7492977/?ref_=tt_urv

10 September 2010,creedreaper,10," Completely Lives upto it's Expectations!!
","If you are a fan of trilogy, you shall not be disappointed. This movie completely lives up to it's expectations. Honestly I don't think 3D was necessary but still it was a great add on. They introduce a new star cast who were familiar from TV shows etc. and they also did a great job. Also don't storm out of theaters right after the credits, stay for few minutes and see a MAJOR clue. Milla Jovovich yet again surprises us with her charismatic hardcore action. I cannot imagine anyone else for the role of Alice besides her. Ali Larter didn't had a major role but she also kicked butt! And offcourse if you like Zombies, this one has more than the previous parts. The soundtracks of the movie were breath-taking. They literally gave me goosebumps! I'm just not happy that it wasn't long enough. I was hoping for it to be at least 120mins but it was instead 90mins but I guess they are saving it for the next chapter. And yes believe me there will be a next one! I cannot wait to own this movie in Blu-Ray.",/review/rw7492977/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Afterlife"" is not inferior to its predecessors. In fact, we have more fight, more adrenaline, more strength, and more special effects typical of a sci-fi sequel movie. The plot is clever, original and have logic sequence of events. And the music was very well selected and suited the scenes perfectly.",/review/rw7492977/?ref_=tt_urv
