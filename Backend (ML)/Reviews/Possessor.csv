29 April 2022,bitbucketchip,5," Why oh why?
","Why can't they portray scientists correctly onscreen? Scientists have emotions, sure, but they are also able to think logically and rationally. This group of scientists have more in common with Hollywood writers sitting in a room than actual researchers. Nothing they do is logical, rational, or reasonable.",/review/rw6361871/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2020,omendata,7," A series that actually ends... wow!
","I have to disagree with all the low score ""i figured it out"" ever so clever crew; when I watch a movie I switch off and let it flow over me and I didnt figure out the ending at all and found it a pleasant surprise or ""twist in the tale"" as they used to say in the days of Tales Of The Unexpected and it was well pulled off in my opinion for what it is worth. As long as you can still watch a movie for the enjoyment and are not the type who sits and picks all the flaws with the plot, trying desperately to figure out the ending to prove how smart you are and picking issues with props I am sure you will enjoy this.",/review/rw6361871/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2020,premmgor,8," What else do you need?!
","When the communication to the outside world stops, Everything is suddenly falling apart for a small group of scientists of an International base station in Antarctica. There are six episodes each creating enough suspense and thrill to make you binge-watch the show. The BGM and Screenplay are the highlights of the show. It's one of the shows in which you keep guessing 'what will happen next?'. Though the last episode seems rushed, overall you won't be disappointed if you love mystery thrillers like Me! Highly Recommended! ðŸ˜„",/review/rw6361871/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2020,px-82689,8," Enjoyable Mystery
","A reworking of the classic mystery theme of an isolated trapped group of multinational people, most of whom have a shared past, begin to be killed off one by one. Add the 6 month polar night, the deadly temperatures, polar T-3 syndrome ( a real behavioral affliction of polar explorers), interpersonal issues, loss of communication, planetary ecological implications, and attempting to reconstruct events from the traumatized memory(?) of a person who might be a victim or a perpetrator makes for an interesting mystery. Yes there are physical events that require a suspension of disbelief and some questionable decisions made by various people. You might at first think that it is just another formulaic plot that you have seen before but it is well worth watching to the satisfying conclusion.",/review/rw6361871/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2020,namstonk,4," Good start but falls apart
","A good effort, well directed and acted, enjoyable for the first four episodes then the plot just falls apart. This ends up with you feeling a little cheated, there is genuine mystery for the initial episodes but clearly the writer couldn't think of a mysterious enough ending so went for the obvious and used method.",/review/rw6361871/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2020,TheUrbanIntrovert,9," Brilliant, Keeps you guessing until the end.
","One of the best mystery series I've seen this year so far. As I started watching, I thought it was just going to be the usual antarctic sci-fi horror rip off the The Thing. Only when I kept watching it, I realised this is a different beast all together. The way they kept revealing secrets slowly, peeling off the true mystery; it was just absolute brilliant. It made me keep guessing & second guessing myself.",/review/rw6361871/?ref_=tt_urv

12 August 2020,silva_e_souza,4," Interesting but with disappointing ending
","Interesting but with a disappointing ending. The first chapter was fantastic, telling the story from its end. Was cool. And the following chapters, from the first to the fifth episode, were very good but the last one was terrible .. There is only one witness for the prosecution and is she credible? I didn't like the ending, OK?",/review/rw6361871/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2020,Quigonjay,8," Enjoyable mystery/drama
","Whodunit type mystery/drama. Certainly an international effort - Spanish/Japanese production set at a research station in the South Pole in English, Swedish and Danish languages and filmed in the Canary Islands. Some great performances from some of the cast, keeps you guessing until the end.",/review/rw6361871/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2020,tonydun,4," Crazies in the snow
","I only got a couple of episodes in and I had to stop. The plot was heavily reliant on heavily flawed people acting badly. When you realise how intensely people are scrutinised and analysed before being sent to Antarctica, this just seemed so unlikely it seemed a tad ridiculous to me. If you're happy to suspend your critical faculties and roll with it, you might enjoy it but I couldn't.",/review/rw6361871/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2020,concreterdude,5," Watching this was a lot of work.
","Not a thriller. Was about as thrilling as 90210.
Hardly a mystery. While there is a mystery. You cant solve it because the clues get served to slowly and blatantly.
Low brow fantasy. Every major plot point is built around something that is not going to ever happen.",/review/rw6361871/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2020,connorundrumme,4," Beyond stupid!
","The tiniest grain of a mystery is enshrouded in tons of time-wasting nonsense. The acting was good, especially considering the writing, and I really wanted to like this, but it was 80% flashback videos, became totally ridiculous in more than a couple of ways by E02/03, then it just kept going:

26 December 2020,Xavier_Stone,2," Draws you in but then gives everything away
","The first episode is interesting and it makes for an interesting story.
But having the entire story be a flash back from one of 2 or 3 lone survivors is a terrible idea for a murder mystery. I mean, it's one of the 3 so it's not that hard to figure out and isn't really that much of a spoiler since everything is pretty much laid out bare in the first 10 minutes.
The real struggle is trying to figure out how stupid these people are.
By the end you're just wishing it was aliens or something just to make the whole thing more plausible.",/review/rw6361871/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2020,bball_mnky,4," Started strong, finished weak

19 February 2021,ellenhouston-87900,9," Kept me guessing...
","This is an excellent who-dun-it series much in the old school style of 'And Then There Were None' like an Agatha Christie novel. Murderer on the loose, questioning the motive of each of the players with a little bit of the story unfolding after each death. I loved the multiple twists in plot and it kept me guessing. I appreciated the novel idea to set the story at a science station in Antarctica. Film gave a nod to some famous explorers as well as to another film set in an Antarctic science station that will go unnamed.... Unlike other reviewers I enjoyed the climate change elements in the script, it added a new dimension to the story-telling, but can appreciate why other reviewers thought it was perhaps insulting to scientists or weakly represented. One recommendation, this is not a show to binge watch in one sitting. Take your time with it, enjoy its complexity and excellent acting, there is a lot going on in each episode that you don't want to miss.",/review/rw6361871/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2021,peterk727,3," Speed watch this one
","This is a very slow suspenseful drama that would have made a much better 2 hour movie. Instead they stretched it into 6 one hour episodes. Slow, boring at times, you can speed watch this series using the Fast Forward button. Acting is mediocre, not a great story and you can really skip Episodes 4 and 5 or increase the Fast Forward speed and still follow the series. Ugh! Pick a different show. This one is stupid.",/review/rw6361871/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2021,jcdunn-90464,2," Why is this named ""The Head""?
",The negative reviews provided by others provide plenty of reasons I regretted watching this series. The primary problem is the writing. There was so much implausibility in the storyline. Plus it is difficult to understand why the writers felt it necessary to drag this out for six hours. 90 minutes would have been more than enough to tell this lame story.,/review/rw6361871/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2021,ebeckstr-1,6," An unfortunate miss
","I can understand why a lot of people like this show quite a bit. It had a lot of potential - decent acting, an intriguing Agatha Christie + John Carpenter setup - but ultimately is two episodes too long, with a resolution which, while somewhat surprising and engaging, is too preposterous. I'm not sure it was worth the wait of 6 hours of viewing time. If you do watch it be sure you do so right up until the closing credits.",/review/rw6361871/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2020,nezthe,9," Good , but?
","I enjoyed this, but thought Maggie was too good to be true. My only problem is if something like this happened in real life, there's no way the truth about Maggie's real identity wouldn't come out. Solid drama though.",/review/rw6361871/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2021,lanellkeith3,8," Excellent
",This should have gotten higher ratings. It's an excellent 6 episode series. With expert story telling and a great twist. Definitely a worthy watch. It's a foreign film but mostly English with limited subtitles. If I were to guess... the next season will probably start a new story. But that's just a guess.,/review/rw6361871/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2021,enterlexx,," Cold, but no steamy breath to be seen.
","If there is one way to tell it is cold it would be your breathing.
Of course it doesn't always directly show irl , but no visible breath at all is too weird when in the freezing cold.

16 October 2020,mpless,1," So Poorly Written It Gives Me Chills
","I had high hopes for this because it's a genre that I enjoy. Sadly, almost from the outset it proved to be a disappointment that only got worse with time. I decided to compile a list of plot holes and implausibilities for the show, from memory. I stopped at 42.",/review/rw6361871/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2020,hamzaoam,8," Sounds good

13 December 2020,Cujo_Firebird,7," Mystery fans will solve it mid way through
","Well acted and fairly well written. Dialogue holds true for the most part and the actors are very believable though some character development could have happened, and possibly left on the cutting room floor. Sets and camerawork very good. Fairly high production value.",/review/rw6361871/?ref_=tt_urv
