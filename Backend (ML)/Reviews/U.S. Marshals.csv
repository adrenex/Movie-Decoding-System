13 December 2019,hsarikayaa,7," The most Micheal Bay movie Micheal Bay ever Micheal Bayed
","The title is just a quote from Ryan :D The movie is a chaos. And i mean in a good way. I think platforms like Netflix and so on is just a place for people like Micheal Bay so they can go do their thing so freely. There is so many to talk about actually. The great crazy action opening sequence right away, really weird song choices including the internet meme one(RUN) and so on... I liked the way the mood changes and kinda turns into a political fight. Also, the good about it is that it's not a stupid American provocative movie. Not the best time i had but definetely it was different and fun.",/review/rw5329551/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2020,Gordon-11,," Attention deficit
","The film is just endless attention deficit scenes which jumps like crazy. There is no coherence or story development. I honestly don't know what I really watched. The visuals are good, and the film is obviously big budgeted. However, these don't make a good film.",/review/rw5329551/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2019,Markyajv,8," This isn't Scorsese or Mann.... It's Bay! Just have fun.
","These reviewers who watch a Michael Bay movie and review it as if they were expecting Shakespeare need to stop reviewing. Seriously. The only reason to watch his flicks are so you can leave your brain at the door, turn off the lights, turn up the surround sound to 100 and sit back and watch $hit blow up. You want a thinking person's movie? Go see something else. You want your brain mushed then watch this! Was awesome, funny, action filled, fast cars, explosions, I was blowing bubbles out of my ears. Such fun.",/review/rw5329551/?ref_=tt_urv

13 December 2019,zack_gideon,9," Michael Bay on Steroids and HGH!!!
","I'm not a huge bay guy, but this is him, unleashed. I'm sure Netflix just said do what ever you want we trust u. And u know what it's a really great ACTION movie. I like action movies that are really action movies. No holds barred.",/review/rw5329551/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2019,TwistedContent,6," By-the-books Blockbuster
","Michael Bay Deluxe, the BOOM, the POW and Ryan Reynolds. It's just about what I was expecting - mindless action, shallow story, (mostly) bland comedy, cliché characters & Reynolds doing his usual shtick. The explosions, gunfights and chases are a little less awesome on the streaming screen, but still deliver the manly blockbuster entertainment we came for in the first place.",/review/rw5329551/?ref_=tt_urv

","I don't mind a brainless action flick occasionally, provided its well done. 6 Underground can generously be described as "" a tossed salad of awfulness"".",/review/rw5329551/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," 6 Underground
","It's a good mix of action and comedy.
the first 15 minutes will blow your mind - special effects like no other",/review/rw5329551/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2019,daniels-thaabiet,8," Blockbuster Action
","Has Michael Bay won an Academy award? No. Will he win an Academy Award? No. Is his movies pointless fun? Yes. That's the beauty of a Michael Bay movie, you know what you're getting and this was no exception, was it flawless? No. Was it 2 hours of fun? Hell Yes. So again if you want to see a near flawless movie, go watch Joker, if you want to watch a pure action adrenaline movie, this is the one.",/review/rw5329551/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2019,mdroddis,8," It's a Friday night movie
","So you have had a long tough week at work.
It's Friday, and you want to escape your work life.
You open a bottle of wine, pour a glass and put a movie on.
You have escaped the dire reality of 9-5.
This film is a perfect release, it has action, it has Ryan Reynolds based humour. It will never be an Oscar nominee for best picture, but hey, it's Friday night, you have a glass of wine in your hand and you want to release the week.
At times it felt like a film
By numbers but nowadays it is extremely rare not too.
So please, enjoy the film for what it is. It's action. It's fun. It's Friday night so enjoy.",/review/rw5329551/?ref_=tt_urv

","Over two hours of fast action packed coordination, chaos, laughs and loved every moment of it.
Just sit back and enjoy the ride...as this is what entertainment is all about.
Over and out!",/review/rw5329551/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2019,vjdino-37683,8," Exaggerated, perhaps. Fun, always. Each Michael movie is a 90 'video clip.
","Exaggerated, perhaps. Fun, always. Each Michael movie is a 90 'video clip. Visually perfect. Emotionally it can involve if you leave rationality for the duration of the vision. For the omega generation it is the best! For the previous ones it's rubbish. Why warm up (or cool down) so much and give negative judgments. Much will continue to be appreciated as blamed! Relax and enjoy the show, popcorn is free!",/review/rw5329551/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2019,viktorhornberg,9," What's up with all the angry reviews?
","It's an action movie with action stuff in it its not a deep movie or a complicated one just watch it when you want to chill in the couch and don't want to focus that much.
I hope they do a second one because sometimes movies like this can be great",/review/rw5329551/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2019,gideonzack,8," Fun Action Movie!
","Ignore the negative haters on here. I'm not a huge action guy, but I found this one quite enjoyable. Good combo of crazy action scenes, comedy and some good acting. I actually think it could have been a bit longer at the end, but overall a very enjoyable movie with great car chases and grandios action sequences that impressed me. 8/10! Enjoy!.... Also a cool message. :)",/review/rw5329551/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2019,Fella_shibby,6," Disjointed n incoherent back n forth cuts, shaky cam, flickering lights, abysmal editing n screenplay, far fetched parkour n lack of hand to hand combat.
","The film starts with a nice picturesque settings, very soothing cinematography but then suddenly it turns into a mindless car chase,
of course with lots of bloody carnage n mayhem. The parkour scenes looked too far fetched n done in a very badly shaky cam stuff.
It has some bloody shootouts n awesome scenes of car getting sliced but the film got tedious after some time.
I had always liked Mélanie Laurent ( her topless scene in Enemy n her distinctive nose).
Had expectations with the film but Michael Bay has lost it.",/review/rw5329551/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2019,TheBabayaga,2," This should be buried deep underground
","Michael Bay's 6 Underground has every single crash, bang and wallop any desensitised moviegoer could possibly ask for. Everything about this film is a vicious assault on the senses akin to the D-Day invasion of Normandy. I swear that every noise of the universe is in this 'movie'.",/review/rw5329551/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2019,stehartley,8," lots of fun

16 December 2019,scott_j_marshall-33-567110,3," Could have been so much more
","""Cliches and poor editing"" would be my brief summary. There's some great action pieces but then it's followed up by lots of quick shots from different angles that are of no use, or a slow motion sequence that is out of place. It's like the movie was made by AI, with a heap of tropes fed into a computer and this is what spits out. You could give it to a film school class and say ""what would you fix and how?"" and it would keep them busy for the whole semester, but I reckon they could come up with a great product by the end. Unfortunately, this is the 'before' photo.",/review/rw5329551/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2020,kosmasp,7," It's Bayhem
","Does the name Michael Bay tell you something? Do you feel like you know the movies he does and do you like them? If you answer yes to both, congratulations. To be honest more often than not I'm not down with movies that really do not give you much in the department of character development. But this is Bay and the action is terrific.",/review/rw5329551/?ref_=tt_urv

18 December 2019,Leofwine_draca,5," Typically overblown and underwritten
","6 UNDERGROUND is the latest from Hollywood blockbuster director Michael Bay, here working in collaboration with Netflix for the first time. You know, I thought Bay had matured since his BAD BOYS 2 days, what with producing quality fare such as the excellent BLACK SAILS. It seems not. This is a hark back to the TRANSFORMERS days of old, i.e. endless big-scale action sequences and not a lot else. The film suffers from having myriad annoying characters, all competing to be witty and edgy, led by Ryan Reynolds basically playing Deadpool without the costume. I could do without them. The action is typically overblown and bombastic, chock-full of explosions and mayhem, and I did appreciate the gratuitous violence throughout, although some of the FX are a little off. It's a lightweight and instantly forgettable movie but it does keep your attention throughout, so the definition of a popcorn flick.",/review/rw5329551/?ref_=tt_urv
