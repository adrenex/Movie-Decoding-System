17 October 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Tommy's Back!
","Power Book IV: Force is the third and easily the best of the spin-offs from Power. I've been a fan of Power and all the spin-offs but I like this one the most. That's obviously because the story is about the best character in the entire Power universe...Tommy Egan! It's almost impossible not to root for him. If you didn't fall in love with Tommy in Power, you definitely will here. It follows Tommy as he leaves New York a wanted man and goes to Chicago to make a name for himself and eventually take over. He breaks all the local rules to become the biggest drug dealer there. It's non stop action that will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the series. This series is good from the first episode through to the last. If you're a fan of Power or looking for a gritty gangster show then you'll love this!",/review/rw7884400/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2022,Supermanfan-13,9," Great!
","I was a fan of of the original Power (except for the terrible ending) and have liked all of the spin-offs so far too but I have to say that Power Book IV: Force is easily the best spin-off yet. None are as good as the original but this is the closest of them. Obviously, Tommy Egan was a huge fan favorite and is the main reason why this show is good. Joseph Sikora does such a great job as Tommy and the supporting cast all hold their own in this too. I'm really looking forward to future seasons!",/review/rw7884400/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2022,atdmv,10," So far, the best show in the Power Universe
","I started out really disliking Tommy in the original show, but his growth as a character made me appreciate his motivations and actions. He is still a deplorable person, but it makes for a great entertaining show.",/review/rw7884400/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2022,oscarjneklund,7," Good! ðŸ˜ˆ
","Tommy egan is evil as hell, and I love it. The actor Joseph Sikora really knows how to get into character, what a great job. When a show is shaped around you just one main character, it can be hard to stay in character, but Sikora can definetly do that. It wouldn't surprise me if he stayed off the script sometimes, because things he's saying, it just can't be scripted! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡²",/review/rw7884400/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is better than Power, I tried raising kanin, but didn't like it, although I did like the 80/90s theme, this is so good, it did take me about 3 eps to get into, but most shows do, so excited to see Tommy Flannigan as a villain again, love him, he never disappoints, Lilly Simmons is great, I feel like her character is an extension of her Rebecca Character on Banshee, if she moved to Chicago, the Puerto Rican chick is great as well, Great Character development here and that is extemely important, the son is even sexy and he was not in the show Awkward, Tommy is so ambitious, its fun to take this ride along with him and almost all the characters are likeable, I'm on eps.7 and it's just getting better, I'll probably watch again, their are no shows this good on anywhere right now, or in the past 6 months, I started the Ghost one and it's like a extra season of power and is enjoyable, but this is special, I highly recommend and I have a low tolerance for boredom, it's hard for me to get into anything, most shows these days suck and lose my interest right away!",/review/rw7884400/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2023,timsem_sem,7," Tommy is Back
",My first thought was Tommy is Back I liked Tommy in The original Power but to be honest Tommy isn't the same without Ghost I give this a 7 star because it wasn't the worst thing I watch this year but not as good as The original power and Power Book 2 my opinion on it better then Raising Kanan but that's not saying much . It just seems like Tommy isn't the same without Ghost . But maybe season 2 will turn out better . But Tommy is Tommy but like I said just not the same without Ghost It just sucks seeing that Ghost died I think everyone was hopping to see Ghost comes back like they fake his death or something I mean just was the worst thing about Power was that Ghost died ..,/review/rw7884400/?ref_=tt_urv

25 April 2022,lappalaineniivari,10," This is why I watch TV
","Brilliant - nothing more to be said. You need to watch this show. I wish there were more characters on TV like Tommy (Sikora). But for now, I am just happy to be able to watch him & the rest of the cast. I will say it again, brilliant. Must watch for anyone interested in the genre.",/review/rw7884400/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2022,moniquerich,9," I'm enjoying this one
","So far, Force is turning out to be pretty good. Tommy is, well, Tommy. I like the new characters and the storyline. I'm not from Chicago, but I love what I'm seeing. The rivalries are great between the Irish, the Serbians, and the black people. I'm only on episode 6, and I can't wait for the next 4!",/review/rw7884400/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2022,FortyFiversNBG,8," Great, but....
","I'm a 'Power' fan for life, the only thing that bothers me is the 'broken Russian' instead of Serbian... Too many serious Serbian actors who could play Mirkovic and the gang, and make it more genuine, but you picked those guys... smdh.",/review/rw7884400/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2022,AfricanBro,7," Nothing out of the box or new.
","It's too early to say but I do like how it's starting off, despite what I'm about to say now. I still have a couple issues, not problems but issues. It's just all a bit cliche-ridden. The Irish gang... the leader is sick, probably dying of cancer, still drinking for the pain and doesn't want anyone to know or see a doctor 'cause of his ego, he's sexist so wants his short sighted hothead son to take lead after he dies yet his daughter is more competent but she's just doing the books instead. Says it's a ""man's work"". Cliche. She's also seems unemotionally attached to any partners she has, boss lady vibes and I'm sure at some point she's gonna say something similar to ""you men don't know how to do business"" or ""there's a smarter way to solve this than using brute force"". Potential cliche. Tommy falls for a girl he just met at a bar that was only supposed to a short stop, he drops everything for her and decides he wants to stay. Tough guy goes and starts trouble for her ex, who coincidentally is also the son of his soon to be rival, just doesn't know it yet. They're probably gonna have a fight soon and the girl is gonna feel bad but still stick with Tommy. It's going to be the new guy in town getting the girl and going against the established mogul father.",/review/rw7884400/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2022,wjosephjorob,8," Fish out of water, gangster style!
","How could they make a character that's despicable be so cool, this program manages to do that, we get a Tommy Egan T. V. show set in Chicago, he's virtually a fish out water in the criminal landscape of the city, trying to find a way to be successful doing it the only way he knows how to, by being vicious and ruthless, if you could stomach the language and attitudes then you're going to be O. K.
The criminal element going up against this dude, better be ready, he survived New York, he's only around to make money and won't let anything get in his way, very good first two episodes of this program, looking forward to watching this show, wait till one of my favorite characters show up in that city, Two-Bit, this is one thirsty dude probably just as bad as Tommy, another survivor looking for a come up, the Power universe is very entertaining so far.",/review/rw7884400/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2022,brandonneicke,9," Best of the power series
",This is even better than the original. Minus ghost and he's a character and actor that can never be forgotten. This is the best quality of writing in the universe and it's definitely got some great new Actors added. Quality directing and over all a real banger of a show. I can't give it 10 because what would I give shows like the wire and breaking bad? However I'm comparison to any new stuff it's a 10 today.,/review/rw7884400/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2022,Veritas99,8," Finally...
","Tommy is back, that Power Book II with Tariq is unwatchable, is has nothing from Ghost charisma...
Can't wait to see Tommy's new adventures, hopefully without Tariq's face anywhere in it.",/review/rw7884400/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2022,weltsr-51193,4," Super Thug
","All Tommy needs to make this farce complete are tights, cape and a mask. Single handedly taking over the under world in Chicago? About as believable as him killing off an entire mob family without a scratch at the end of the original show. Just a little realism could make this a drama worthy of the Power moniker.",/review/rw7884400/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2022,lanemam,10," Best ever

4 May 2022,stacyjmcdowell-66282,10," Amazing season
","I have been watching Power since season 1. We are now into the spin offs. I have watched them all. However my favorite,hands down, no comparison is Power Force. I mean Tommy (Sikora) is such a strong character that in his own he pulls you in. I fell in love with his character in Season 1 Episode 1 and been ride or die since then. I can't wait to see his new movie come out. He is an all around amazing actor. He is also very humbled and interacts with his fans which makes him even more amazing.",/review/rw7884400/?ref_=tt_urv

1 March 2022,BoringJoe,6," Probably the best since original Power, but clichÃ©d and cartoonish.
","Everything is far too neat in how things seem to work out to the point it becomes completely unrealistic. Yes I know it's a fictional show, and yes I know we must suspend or unbelief, but there should be an element of authenticity. Yet Tommy just happens to come into contact with all the most powerful people in Chicago in what's supposed to be a random sequence of events.",/review/rw7884400/?ref_=tt_urv
