22 February 2006,TOMASBBloodhound,8," Bad things just happen. We usually can't stop them.
","The Mothman Prophecies is a solid thriller. It's supposedly based on true events, but even if it weren't, it would be worth a look. Richard Gere stars as a Washington Post reporter who inexplicably finds himself in a small West Virginia town where a series of strange goings-on have been happening. His wife was killed two years prior in a mysterious car accident, and there seems to be a connection between her death and the strange happenings in Point Pleasant. Holding the key behind the mystery seems to be a large moth-like creature who tends to show up in places where the loss of human life is about to occur. Gere meets up with several locals who claim to have seen the Mothman, and after a while this creature begins communicating with him. The creature warns people of tragedies about to strike (plane crashes, earthquakes), and Gere thinks this creature can even put him in contact with his dead wife. Gere is given a warning about an upcoming tragedy near Point Pleasant, but can he act in time to stop it? Or should he even try? The film is very moody and sullen. The direction and photography are top drawer, and they enhance the mood greatly. The acting is terrific, as well. I usually can't stand Gere, but he's great in this film. Laura Linney would seem miscast as a local cop, but by the end of the film, she will have proved how truly talented she is. Will Patton is outstanding as a local resident who has several run-ins with the Mothman until it drives him crazy.",/review/rw1747169/?ref_=tt_urv

","John Klein (Richard Gere), a Washington Post reporter, finds himself somehow drawn to a small town in West Virginia. In fact, his car dies, along with his cell phone and watch. He knocks on a nearby house to call for help, and the man who answers the door attacks him, saying Klein's been around three days in a row. But has he?",/review/rw1747169/?ref_=tt_urv

4 August 2010,Cujo108,," About as eerie as it gets
","Based on actual events that occurred in the 60's. John and Mary Klein are a happy couple who have just purchased a new house. The excitement over their new place is short-lived when they have a car accident following the purchase. Mary winds up in the hospital with a head injury, but the CT scans reveal that she has something far worse wrong with her. She eventually dies, leaving a devastated John to discover that she had been drawing sketches of moth-like figures during her time at the hospital. A year passes, and John is scheduled to do an interview for his Washington Post job. On his drive to the interview, he mysteriously winds up in Point Pleasant, West Virginia with no recollection of how he got so far out of his way. Mysterious events are plaguing this small town, events that may be connected to what happened to his wife.",/review/rw1747169/?ref_=tt_urv

21 November 2015,reb-warrior,9," Very interesting, creepy, spooky tale
","I don't quite class it as horror, but more of a supernatural mystery thriller. Fascinating that this thing is based on real life reports. It gives it more of the creepy factor. That aside, it's just a really good nail-biter.",/review/rw1747169/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2005,Lechuguilla,," History Revised
","In 1966-67 a series of weird, supposedly supernatural, events occurred in or near Point Pleasant, West Virginia. Much of what happened centered on local residents' purported encounters with UFOs; confrontations with ""men-in-black""; phone calls from entities whose voices sounded electronic (or metallic); and sightings of a winged, semi-human creature that came to be known as ""mothman"". A few locals also were made privy to future predictions (prophecies), some of which in fact did materialize, but others didn't. One of the alleged predictions was a December, 1967 disaster that did occur, and which this film dramatizes.",/review/rw1747169/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2012,eytand94,9," The Mothman Prophecies: True Horror That Brings On Some Serious Chills!
","While several horror movies advertise themselves as being ""based on true events,"" they are usually just fabrications of the actual material. ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre's"" brutality and nightmarish setting make the movie's inspiration(the Ed Gein murders) something to look into, especially since the events inspired ""Psycho"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs."" ""The Amityville Horror"" is a question of truth or myth. Was that house haunted? We don't know, mostly because Hollywood had to exaggerate everything. However, 2002's ""The Mothman Prophecies"" comes along, and when one is knowing of the real story and John A. Keel's book, the movie makes you think differently about ""true story"" horror. Music video director Mark Pellington has given us a movie that not only interests genre fans, but actually pulls through on bringing you a big case of the creeps.",/review/rw1747169/?ref_=tt_urv

16 April 2019,classicsoncall,7," ""All kinds of things exist around us that we never see.""
","Like a handful of other reviewers for this picture, I too felt that it had the flavor of an X-Files story. Considering all the Monster of the Week episodes that show came up with, it's a bit surprising they never tackled the legend of the Mothman. The closest they ever came was a fifth season episode titled 'Detour', in which Mulder considers the creature that he and Scully are tracking may be related to cryptids like the Mothman, a cryptid being an animal whose existence cannot be substantiated. Richard Gere and Laura Linney in a way seem to be acceptable stand-ins for agents Mulder and Scully in this film, although the entity they attempt to investigate seems to be more of a supernatural aspect than an actual animal or person.",/review/rw1747169/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2002,SILV3R,7," Surprisingly entertaining
","Starting off promisingly with X-Files creepy events (deaths and visions) this young persons horror movie has a suitably tense edge. Based on a myth last discussed in great detail in the 60s, this is a modernised version of the legend of the Mothman, a mysterious figure who comes to people to foretell disastrous events. There is an air of Saturday night channel 5 about this film, but don't let that discourage you as its in the upper echelons of b-movie fair.",/review/rw1747169/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2008,michaeljharvey,9," Brilliantly unsettling.
","If you're a fan of a good psychological scare, this film will stick with you for a long time. Richard Gere stars as John Klein, a Washington newspaper reporter who encounters a moth-like apparition driving home with his wife late one night. His wife dies mysteriously after the ensuing car accident and Klein becomes convinced this apparition was to blame. When he hears of similar sightings (a tall, thin, humanoid creature with moth-like wings and red glowing eyes) in a rural West Virginia town, he becomes obsessed with finding the truth.",/review/rw1747169/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2021,filipemanuelneto,8," A good mystery film that never seemed to me to have been properly valued.
","I really like this film, where the terror is subtle and the tension builds up very well and remains almost until the end. It is a film that wins in being seen by audiences that do not know well what it is about. The more we read before seeing it, the more we spoil the feeling of tension and mystery that the film wants to build. The film is loosely based on a real accident on the Ohio River in the Sixties, and associates it with a series of appearances by a mysterious creature. Nowadays very forgotten, I think that this film was never truly valued for what it is.",/review/rw1747169/?ref_=tt_urv

17 May 2005,christian123,5," One of the better thrillers of 2002
","The Mothman Prophecies is a creepy thriller that doesn't make as big as an impact as you would expect. Based on true events, the film examines a series of inexplicable occurrences through the eyes - and mind - of one man played by Richard Gere. The plot sounds creepy and the fact that its based on true events sure makes it more engaging. The film looks and sounds scary as well and there are a few scenes that are bound to get underneath your skin. The film is still kind of disappointing as they don't really explain the movie so well and your left with too many unanswered questions. Sometimes its hard to take the movie seriously as there are some scenes that don't make sense or that the scene kind of feels like a joke. Like said before though, the film should still creep underneath your skin. Richard Gere stars and he gives a very good performance. He makes up for starring in that awful film called Autumn in New York. Laura Linney also does a good and these two really keep the film moving. Mark Pellington directs and he does a good job of keeping the film at a nice pace and making the film look creepy. The ending was done decently and it sure makes you think about what happens. The Mothman Prophecies will leave its mark on you and you may have trouble getting it out of your head when its time to go to sleep. The film is almost two hours long so you may start to get bored if you find the film to be stupid. Pretty much if you like the X-Files or The Forgotten then you should enjoy this thriller. The Mothman Prophecies may not be top notch thriller but its still worth checking out and will make a good rental to watch at night. Rating 6.7/10 a sometimes scary thriller that's worth checking out.",/review/rw1747169/?ref_=tt_urv

31 May 2002,uds3,," THIS is cinema !!!
","One common thread seemingly shared by all those who did not like this movie, aside from the fact their brains never developed beyond puberty, is their total incapacity to verbalise WHY they didn't like it or what aspects they believed should have been bettered, not to mention, HOW they personally would have gone about this reformation themselves?  It is of little consequence I suppose - cerebral implosion has always interested me as a physiological condition. That this great film has inspired a universal rating of only 6.6 bears testament to my belief that today's viewing audience are, for the most part cretins - or getting there! I realise also that these comments most likely condemn this review never to be published, since the IMDb frowns heavily (and funnily enough I agree with this policy) on the slating of other IMDb reviewers. This particular film however incites my anger towards these negative and terminally limited people, like no other I can recall! ",/review/rw1747169/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2021,skrstenansky,8," Extremely underrated
","This movie is absolutely just an amazingly great and surprisingly well done movie. The movie's plot honestly sounded pretty dumb going into but I decided to watch it after some time, and actually found this very enjoyable. It makes it seem advertised to be a monster movie or some bad horror movie, but it's not either of those. This is more of a weird and mysterious movie, mainly based on psychological like experiences by a unknown entity. Very entertaining and very well done, do not listen to all the bad reviews this is actually worth your time and very good.",/review/rw1747169/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2002,CatTales,1," you will mysteriously lose 2 hours and $7.50 on this dud
","There's a good 5 minute story buried in this subjectively shot movie that tries too hard and utterly fails to scare. I was filled with dread as the credits appeared over a meaningless running shot of office fluorescent lights and close-ups of everyday, irrelevant, inherently unscary objects. As the film progresses we get more irrelevant close-ups, disorienting angles, hand-held camera shots, rapid editing and fast drum-beat soundtrack. And more close-ups. Soon you'll be wishing you took some dramamine. The movie tries to make EVERYTHING scary, with the result that nothing seems scary. There are a few standard ""jolts"" when something appears out of nowhere  - the usual filmic way of saying ""Boo."" But after a dozen times of the now-cliche camera zooming to and away from a character, the panicked look he's left with seems probably caused by a sudden camera in the face rather than a ghost. The creepiest-potential moment when Indrid Cole (aka Kindred Spirit?) phones our hero is dissipated by the excessive layering of visuals. Soon any plot or sense of realism is lost - what about our hero's job? what day or night is it? what does he do most of the time in Point Pleasant? why and how does his initial meeting with a young couple happen at night in the quarry instead of the day, and do they really mention all the sexual details we see as they relate their mothman encounter? All the irrelevent camera shots encourage the viewer to ponder irrelevent questions: Is that little guy in the sound lab making a music CD of his glass-lip rubbing? Do ethereal mothfolk really leave slime when hit by a car, and are there accident attorney mothpeople that represent them in mothcourt? To make something creepy or uncanny you need some realism to subvert, as one can see in ""One step beyond"" and ""Xfiles."" By becoming more and more erratic, this movie not only seems unbelievable but manages to undermine the credibility of the real events.",/review/rw1747169/?ref_=tt_urv

About 10 years ago I had several occasions to travel to Point Pleasant, WV and Gallipolis, Oh on business.
