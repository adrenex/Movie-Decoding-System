24 September 2008,fertilecelluloid,8," If it were French, Americans would be singing its praises
","If ""Houndog"" were French, it would be praised as a worthy study of a child on the brink of adolescence. But because it's American, it gets attacked (primarily) for its subject because the majority of Americans are uncomfortable with on- or off-screen sexuality (unless it's the crude ""American Pie"" kind) and uncomfortable with depictions of other Americans that don't adhere to their idealistic perceptions of themselves -- as winners.",/review/rw2071444/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2007,MattD12027,4," Ultimately very disappointing.
","This is a bad film. It is not really Dakota's fault, but to be honest I wasn't really impressed with her this time around. I felt like she was a little too much, a little too melodramatic, and definitely not as real as she is in her other films. The real problems with this film lie in the directing, the script, and the pacing. It's poorly filmed (though beautifully lensed), the script panders to too many stereotypes to even enumerate, and even though it's very short, it crawls along.",/review/rw2071444/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2007,davidfrazier42,7," There WAS a point.....
","To keep it brief the movie was just OK for me although there were a couple of decent performances. As a southerner I always hate it when I hear overly exaggerated Southern drawl. It's like fingernails screeching down a blackboard to me. In retrospect I quite liked David Morse' character. In my opinion he took far more risk than Ms. Fanning as the ""addled"" father. We also got a glimpse of the gifted singer Jill Scott. ",/review/rw2071444/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2009,ccthemovieman-1,3," Is This Being Responsible?
","Curiosity got the best of me and I finally saw this controversial film recently on DVD. The controversy centered around a rape scene and whether an 11-year-old girl should be acting out scenes like that. Well, when you're Dakota Fanning and your parents have already placed you in R-rated movies beginning at the age of seven or eight, I guess this is no big deal to them.",/review/rw2071444/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2011,jeffreyjets,7," If you love Dakota Fanning then it is worthwhile
","The voter of 7 was mostly for Dakota and her excellent acting. The story was admittedly slow and plot fairly thin, but then it is a Chick Flick, which is all about emotions and relationships, so pace and plot is somewhat irrelevant. The acting was superb all the way around. I saw it based on Dakota being in it. Everyone else's acting was very good from David Morse, Piper Laurie and the Snake Guy. A better Southern Goth tale is Winter's Bone, but like my summary says ""If you love Dakota Fanning then it is worthwhile."" FYI - I did not hear about all the ""controversy"" about Dakota's character getting raped. It didn't influence me one way or the other. I have known that this has happened and showing it in context is not inflammatory, although if you were a victim and it still greatly messes with your mind, I don't think seeing it would help.",/review/rw2071444/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2008,joshsittre,7," Dakota excellent again!
",I saw the premiere back in 07 in Sundance yes some people booed and some walked out. Some people will fault the obvious metaphors but Dakota deserves a 10 for her performance like Morgan Freeman she can save movies and she does here. The 'controversy' was not founded in the least. I also believe it to be her best performance since man on fire I will of course not give a thing away about the film or what happens suffice it to say her character is someone you want to see win even with her flaws. One scene dares you to see her in a bad way but it never seemed to happen for me. The movie is set deep in the swamps of the south. The first scene in which Dakota's character propositions her friend was a shock for me to I wasn't all the way prepared for her slightly adult turn yet I realized that she was making a turn or step forward in her career.,/review/rw2071444/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2011,hi_im_manic,7," Nice film about Jenny, but where's Forrest?

14 June 2011,Cedric_Catsuits,8," Fails to convince
","Reading some of the reviews here, and elsewhere, it is clear that the reviewers haven't actually seen this film - unless there are lots of different versions out there. They didn't see the film I did, for sure. There is no gratuitous or graphic violence or sex, and the only bit of nudity comes courtesy of David Morse's behind. If anything, a little more sex or violence might have enabled more of today's jaded audience to actually get the point of this movie.",/review/rw2071444/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2007,rebelgyrl05,10," A comment from someone who has seen the film
","I just watched the final Sundance screening of this film earlier this evening. It was excellent. I found it to a highly emotional film with a very powerful message. Also, Dakota Fanning has a beautiful voice for someone who had never sang before filming began. Not beautiful as in technically perfect, but beautiful in the way it conveyed the emotions of the character at the time. Just to clarify for all of those who haven't seen it, there is no pornography in this movie. In fact, Utah's Attorney General watched it for himself, and said that it does not break any laws and contains no child pornography. Please withhold judgment until you have actually seen it.",/review/rw2071444/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2009,thinker1691,6," "" There are places where you can hide, but your conscience is not one of them ""
","In the hidden recesses of the South, there are many tragic stories which emerge about how brutal life is. Often such stories can make it to the big screen and illustrate how difficult it is to put it on film. 'Bastard out of Carolina' and 'Betrayed' are but two examples. Here is another which was purportedly so shocking few would be able to finish it. The movie is called "" Hounddog "" and relates the early life of a little girl named Lewellen (Dakota Fanning) who lives in a shabby, ram shackled house with her itinerant, slightly retarded father, (David Morse) who is scratching out a modest living as a farmer. Helping to raise Lewellen is ""Grammie"" (Piper Laurie) her Grandmother, a strict, overbearing and often religiously intolerant relative who keeps the family secrets and indiscretion records of all the ""Sins"" committed by the family. Lewellen has one close friend named 'Buddy' (Cody Hanford) whom she trusts and shares what little happiness there is in her life. Lewellen has one overpowering ambition and that is to imitate her idol, Elvis Presley (Ryan Pelton). To this end, she will do anything to see him in a live concert. So driven is she to her quest, she allows herself to be tricked and raped. The controversial scene is almost non-existent and nothing if transient. The editing, dialog, directing and script are poor and few scenes are given much depth. So much so, one concludes the story and it's integral film parts are juvenile, haphazard and often amateurish at best. One aspect of the movie should be noted and that is Lewellen's friendship with the neighboring black character called Charles (Afemo Omilami) who offers understanding, comfort, sage advice and medicinal education concerning snakes and the intention of enemies. The movie has gained little accolades aside from the controversy. In short, the movie is interesting, but little which will propel audiences to remember it. **",/review/rw2071444/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2010,moonspinner55,3," Pointless, useless hillbilly portrait...
","A barefoot, backwoods pre-teenage girl in the 1950s Deep South, in love with Elvis Presley's music and with a budding interest in boys, comes-of-age one summer after her father is struck by lightning, leaving her vulnerable to the elements. Dakota Fanning attempts to carry this heavy-handed vehicle all by herself, but it's an impossible task. Writer-director Deborah Kampmeier has no sense of character development, and her timing and details seem askew (at one point, Elvis appears on an old TV set, but obsessed fan Dakota barely seems to take notice). The film garnered a bit of film-festival backlash after news of a rape scene involving Fanning was leaked to the press, but that sequence isn't nearly as disturbing as an earlier one where Grammie Piper Laurie stares strangely at the youngster standing up in the bathtub (is Kampmeier trying to say this girl isn't safe around anybody?). The locations are well-captured, and there are nice supporting performances from Afemo Omilami as a black horse trainer who introduces Fanning to the blues and Robin Wright Penn as the child's promiscuous aunt. Otherwise, these muddled results are entrenched in murky waters. *1/2 from ****",/review/rw2071444/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2007,bananapotato,1," Saw this at Santa Barbara
","The crappy writing has probably been covered. One gets the feeling that Lewellen (Dakota's character) will go on to abuse others. Already she abuses mean to Buddy and Grasshopper. It's like Kampmeier - she too seems to be perpetrating the abuse cycle by using these children to act out all these sexual scenes. It reeks of exploitation, but ironically, the rape scene and Dakota's scenes probably less than all the others. Multiple underwear/undress images of all the children. The bad character (and rapist), Wooden's Boy, was just omically one-dimensional (as was the father, now I consider it). He didn't do anything, just was mean, then raped the girl. A few things don't seem to follow on with each other. There were a lot of scenes cut. Disgustingly, and although I tried not to think about it, Lewellen was a rather horrible character, even portrayed at times as deserving of the abuse, 'asking for it'. Sickening. It didn't seem like a rape victim advocacy movie. I think they just tried to bring that in after the fact. Oh, and exploitation aside - it was still bad. The audience didn't like it and I think there were even some walkouts.",/review/rw2071444/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2007,hettyfarquar,1," One of the most boring and sexually depraved films ever made
","Hounddog must be one of the most boring and sexually depraved films ever made. For some reason, the people involved with production seem to think it's important and will raise awareness, instead of trying the art line, they are now trying the moral tactic. We are now supposed to see this film, because rape happens often, and happens to children often, and none of us are aware of it.",/review/rw2071444/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2011,rmax304823,6," In The Pines, In The Pines...
","I'm not sure but these regionally restricted Southern stories seem to divide themselves into two types. In the first type, we get a series of character sketches, anecdotes without much narrative glue to hold them together. Beth Henley's stories come to mind, and slightly melancholy tales like ""The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter."" In the other category fall stories like ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" and ""Streetcar Named Desire"", dramas in which events unfold apparently in accordance with some greater cosmic plan.",/review/rw2071444/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2007,jenjefk,1," Amateur rubbish
","I saw this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival and was very, very disappointed. First up let me say the rape scene was completely irrelevant to the rest of the story - it seemed very much out of place and like it was just inserted to generate controversy. The film had some tolerable aspects - I like parts of the cinematography - but the music seemed badly chosen and there were a few scenes where the editing didn't seem right - it seemed choppy, done in a hurry (maybe to cut out bits which would have been offending, and pretend they were never shot). Dakota is an astounding actress, but this was one of her weakest roles yet, probably because the inexperienced director was unable to guide her performance. (I thought the same about Robin Wright Penn.) The other child actors appeared to have been equally badly guided, and they don't have the experience of Fanning to be able to give good performances. It was horrible watching some of the scenes they had to do. The worst part of the film was the boring, long and pointless storyline. It was degrading. There was no triumph over adversity, definitely no escapism, no big moral issues that seemed to have been dealt with. This is an over-hyped, amateur hack film that should not be seen by audiences anywhere.",/review/rw2071444/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2007,aaronkalvani,1," The Worst Film Ever Made, boring and depressing
","This is the little girl who played scared in War of the Worlds with Tom Cruise. It looks like she has been pulled out of that film as the same character, as anemic and ill as ever, bullied, and then raped. Its a stupid rape scene that lasts for a few minutes and as I watched it I would only think of the director and the cameras as it seemed so staged. The story is nothing new, and the acting is terrible. The music is badly chosen and more importantly it does not deliver. I think that the only hope the producers and actors have is that the bad publicity that the film has brought from the Catholic Church, may get a few perverts into the cinema. Save your time and watch something bigger budget.",/review/rw2071444/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2007,ihearthuckabees_88,1," As a survivor.....
","I don't find films like this to be at all interesting. A friend thought I might be interested in this one and boy was she wrong. It's bad enough rape happens to real children, why get others to have to act it out? I don't think it's helping anybody. Certainly it didn't help me come to terms with my own trauma, I found it excruciatingly difficult watching the film which is why I walked out. I have spoken to a few others in the same situation as me and none of them are even interested in seeing it, let alone using this film to magically fix their situations, or make them aware that they suffered. It's not suitable for child viewing, and it's so completely unrealistic (the line about the father getting struck by lighting was awful) that I don't think anybody will be identifying with parts from it. There was a strange anti-sex theme that I seemed to pick up, as well as some kind of lesbianism/feminism and anti-men theme. Oh and the snakes was probably the worst imagery I have seen yet in a film.",/review/rw2071444/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2010,drpakmanrains,1," Slow as Molasses
","It is rare that I rent a movie on Netflix and give it one star. And even one star is generous, as this is a slow slow slow paced film trying to be artsy and show the 50's or early 60's south as it was before air conditioning and Civil Rights breakthroughs. It has almost no story, dull characters, and accomplishes very little. The hour and 39 minutes seemed like an eternity. I was waiting for the pimply youth who raped Dakota Fanning to get some comeuppance, but even that didn't really happen. This film was badly written, acted, and directed despite a good cast. Dakota Fanning was not at her best, but compared to the rest of the cast, except for her same age little boy friend, she was the only one with a shred of believability. Piper Laurie reprises her 1976 role in Carrie. Robin Wright Penn and David Morse are wasted in empty performances. I can't believe that anyone could find this movie important or worth the time.",/review/rw2071444/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2010,doctorsmoothlove,2," Fanning the flame
","Hounddog is a movie about many things people (including the author), love to hate about the Old South. The director, Deborah Kampmeier, resorts to cliché after cliché to tell her half-baked story that I'll get mentioning in a few lines. She set the story in the south for no plot necessary reason, and layers our expectations with even more expectations. All of the young white adults are pitiable, uneducated characters who have no control over their lives. The old one is a hard-lined Christian nut, and the black people are oppressed yet compassionate because they are black. This story's only noteworthy player is Fanning's character Lewellen. She is a preteen girl, admittedly a caricature herself, who was fortunately played by someone who delights the audience with her rendition of Scout Finch.",/review/rw2071444/?ref_=tt_urv

","I really enjoyed this movie. It was very interesting and the acting of Dakota was very good. I watched it twice to really get the feel and the point that this movie was trying to present. I have always been a fan of Dakota and her acting in this movie was not a disappointment. The ""rape scene"" was well done so as not to look too offensive. The movie was showing the life of an innocent girl in a small town and how she lived playfully and without any kind of guilt or fear of anything. Kudos to the director and all the actors of this film. This is a movie that shows how encouragement and determination can help a person to stand up again after falling and being an unintented victim of somebody's evil desires.",/review/rw2071444/?ref_=tt_urv

7 July 2009,belindajmay,6," Beautiful film
","Wonderful film. The actors are very convincing. The film takes place in the 1950's and everything about the film is just as I imagined it would be at that time. Dakota Fanning is such an amazing actress. The main character Lewellen lives such a tragic life very reminiscent of the main character in Bastard Out of Carolina. If you loved that film, then you'll probably love this one. Although this one is toned down a lot from Bastard Out of Carolina. Watching Lewellen fall from something so innocent into a tragedy is heartbreaking. I just kept wishing for things to get better for her. Some people may think that the main characters are stereotypically southern, but I come from the South and grew up in conditions not to different from Lewellens, and there ain't nothing' stereotypical about it. From the grandma with a shotgun to treating snake bites with whiskey. This is an amazing film. Give it a chance!",/review/rw2071444/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2009,TxMike,," The superb acting of young Dakota Fanning is the main reason to see this otherwise muddled movie.
","As I think about the brief career of Dakota Fanning there is a certain sadness that she is no longer a child and now has to begin accepting young adult roles. Just 2 weeks ago I saw her in ""The Secret Life of Bees"" where she was clearly into adolescence. But here she appears to be only 11 or at most 12 during filming and still looks like a child.",/review/rw2071444/?ref_=tt_urv
