31 October 2021,deloudelouvain,7," Great cast, nice easy to follow story.
","The Comeback Trail deserves a higher rating than it gets at the moment (5.6 stars while I was writing this). Okay you will not die from laughing but it's certainly pleasant to watch. It's an easy movie to watch, well written, and with a great cast. Robert DeNiro, Tommy Lee Jones, Morgan Freeman, those are world class actors that almost never fail and they didn't in this movie. Add Emile Hirsch and Zach Braff to that cast and you get a movie full of talent and it clearly shows. To give this movie a negative review is just a bad judgement. As a comedy it's just lighthearted but not bad at all.",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2021,Gordon-11,," A pleasant watch
","This comedy is really pleasant to watch. It is light hearted, and it has many big names. I enjoyed it.",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2021,imseeg,7," A good, (but not great) comedy, which deserves a bit more attention than it got...
","Not a great comedy, but certainly good enough for those fans of Tommy Lee Jones and Robert de Niro. Especially Robert de Niro has starred in lesser comedies in the past and however simple this comedy might be, it it still quite enjoyable, without getting big laughs though, because it is more amusing than straight forward funny.",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2021,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," Hilarious and much better than I expected.
","The all-star legendary trio did not disappoint, and the story was surprisingly well thought out and very cleverly written. You'll start to pick up on the many reversals of (mis)fortunes for almost every character, and how in reality they could've been the trend-setting future of the film industry. What I also enjoyed about the story, is how it shows the particular role every person involved has in the making of a film. Then add the awesome on-point comedy that was just right and perfectly executed by all cast, and this little gem of a film is a hit. It's a shame the critics went hard on this one. I'll be certainly watching it again, and it's a well deserved 8/10 from me.",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,jmrecillas-83435,5," A good and decent comedy
","Someone says that if you reunite some old actors to make a comedy you will find with a piece of crap, a bad movie with tons of bad jokes, bad lines and lousy performances. This is not the case. If you avoid fart and sexual jokes, that's a point to count it, since almost every Hollywood comedy from the last decade just repeat that formula. This days it's hard to find in a comedy a masterpiece, and this is not one of that category, but is a pretty decent one, and is genuine funny and worth to watch.",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2020,movieman6-413-929510,5," Beautiful aspects are overshadowed by cartoon comedy.
","The Comeback Trail is a remake of the 1982 action comedy of the same name. This remake is directed and partly written by George Galo, the director of Middle Men and 29th Street.",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2020,trinaboice,7," Slow start but but Act 2 is hilarious
","IN A NUTSHELL:
With a powerhouse cast, this comedy pokes fun at the film industry itself. A movie producer who is mixed up with the mob tries to use an aging movie star in an insurance scam, but the plot thickens...The fun movie is directed by George Gallo. He also wrote the screenplay with Josh Posner based on a 1982 film by Harry Hurwitz. The movie premiered at the 2020 Mill Valley Film Festival. Other than the language, I was extremely entertained.",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2020,nogodnomasters,7," The Producers
","Max Barber (Robert De Niro) and his nephew Walter (Zach Braff) are unsuccessful ""B"" movie producers. Max borrows money from Reggie Fontaine (Morgan Freeman) who demands a return or else. Max gets the idea to insure an old actor, have them do a dangerous stunt, die, and collect a healthy insurance check. Tommy Lee Jones as a washed up cowboy doing his own stunts is his mark.",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2021,darius_sutherland,7," Dumb Fun 6.5 From Me
","Not sure why this has a rating in the 5's. I've seen much higher ratings for much worse. It's nothing amazing but it provided us with some silly slapstick predictable humour. It was an enjoyable simple movie. I'm finding it harder and harder to find funny movies these days. They seemed to have stop making comedies and many have the comedy tag added to them and they are far from comedies. Silly, lighthearted fun. De Niro and Freeman do a good job and Tommy was excellent too.",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2021,al1-3,5," yep, all the funny bits are in the trailer
","You saw it all, why watch the whole thing when it's just padding around what you saw in the trailer? And they wonder why streaming services are taking away crowds from the cinema. Gimme a break. And make of it what you will with the 10/10 reviews!",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2021,japongt,8," Please release ""Killer Nuns""!
","I found this movie to be hilarious. Not perfect, but sure gave me a handful of laughs. Anyone who denies the work of Tommy Lee Jones, Morgan Freeman, and Rober De Niro's ability to do good comedy probably doesn't have a good sense of humor.",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2021,mr-altex,4," No juice
","Actors are doing what they can, the premise is all right, but the overall output of the movie is just boring.",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2021,masonsaul,7," Really good black comedy
","Whilst it's blend of dark humour and slapstick comedy doesn't always work, The Comeback Trail is still a really good black comedy that's funny and heartwarming with good intentions. Robert De Niro and Zach Braff are both great and Tommy Lee Jones and Morgan Freeman are both really good. George Gallo's direction is really good, it's well filmed and well paced. The amount of jokes that land outweigh the ones that don't. The music by Aldo Shllaku is good.",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2021,phoenixinvictus,5," This could have been better if the roles were switched
","If Morgan Freeman had played the ""down on his luck producer"" and Robert de Niro had played the gangster I believe that it would have been funnier. It has its laughable moments and a few gags but as I said I believe that a simple switch of roles could have pushed this to a six star.",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2021,studioginger,8," Funny and entertaining
","I don't understand all the bad reviews about this movie, there is no reason why certain actors have to be stereotyped on every movie they play in.",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2021,HabibieHakim123,8," It's A Fun, Enjoyable, And Very Funny Movie
","""It's a fun, enjoyable, and very funny movie, while it's still not a perfect movie, De Niro, Tommy Lee Jones, and Morgan Freeman hilarious perfomance makes The Comeback Trail succeed making me laugh so hard and having a good time""",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2021,ops-52535,6," not so bad at all...
","With robert de niro at the top of his lungs, spraying verbal sprout everywhere, and ever so loveable tommy lee jones, has become so overcoming of age, still with a staggering limp and a wink in the eye. This is comedy alla 70's and 80's, and the filming sets reminded me about peter sellers ''the party'' with the signal horn in the intro.",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2020,steveinadelaide,7," Amusing
","An amusing movie. Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman, and Tommy Lee Jones looked like they had a good time with this one and it's worth seeing the movie to watch these three in action. Robert De Niro plays his character with the joy and intensity we haven't really seen in recent times. It's a remake of a 1982 movie of the same name (which I haven't seen and I'm not sure anyone else has!). It moves along at a good pace and there were moments when I laughed out loud - but not often. There is a serious element to the story related to Tommy Lee Jones' character (which I won't reveal) and which is at the heart of the plot. It was a pleasant outing and good-humouredly pokes fun at Hollywood.",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv

13 November 2021,docm-32304,7," Pretty Good, Not as Funny as I hoped though
","I watched this film because of the cast. How can a movie with DeNiro, Morgan Freeman and Tommy Lee Jones be bad? The premise is good and I expected side splitting humor, but it just doesn't come off as smooth and fast as I expected. However, Tommy Lee is fantastic and it still makes for an enjoyable watch. I could do with a lot less profanity, but that seems to be a Hollywood signature on anything made in the last decade.",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2021,battlebuckships,1," What a waste of time.
","Love the staff! Great actors one and all, but if this is what Hollywood is producing these days, we're in trouble. Nothing about this film was funny or interesting. Sad to say simply a waste of time watching.",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2021,Markyajv,1," Anytime you see a 10/10....run away!
","Seriously? ""Unreal performance by deniro and freeman. Acting legends!!"" ??? DeNiro is falling into the Eric Roberts, Dolph Lundgren, Lorenzo Lamas territory of acting. At least Morgan Freeman puts out a couple good ones but at this point, if I was their advisor, I'd tell them to retire and enjoy their riches. How much more money can you take from the straving people of the world. Always go out on a high note.",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv

20 April 2021,ezgolucky,4," ""They're nuns with a bad habit...""
","When the ending trailer, Killer Nuns, is the best part, that's saying something about this movie. There are a couple of chuckles, especially from Morgan Freeman's character, but otherwise a drab and boring flick. My advice- fast forward to the end credits and watch the Killer Nuns trailer...",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2021,brian-85466,1," The Producers without the laughs ot talent!
","Don't waste your time, the funniest thing about this movies is when Walter reads a review of he and Max's latest film, the reviewer writes the best thing about this film is its it's only 90 minutes long and then it ends, at 102 minutes then it ends, it's the only positive thing you can say about The Comeback Trail too.",/review/rw6838685/?ref_=tt_urv
