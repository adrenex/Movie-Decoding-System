17 June 2019,rooprect,8," A romcom for effed up people
","I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.",/review/rw2692295/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2012,AdultAudienceMember,9," Stunningly accurate look at the bipolar life.
","I am bi-polar. I have been that way since I was a young man. I am approaching 60. I have been in treatment for many years. There have been relapses and time spent in hospitals. There have been good times. Before I received good treated, I left a trail of emotional, professional, and relational disaster behind me. It broke apart the lives of others as much as it did my own.",/review/rw2692295/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2020,deloudelouvain,8," Entertaining & good story about bipolarity.
","I'm surprised by the negative reviews. I can't really see why people would dislike this movie. Even if it's not really my genre of movie I thought this one was very captivating. Bradley Cooper did a really good job playing his bipolar character, to me it was one of his best performances yet. The Oscar for best female actress went to Jennifer Lawrence, which surprised me a bit, even though she did a good job here. But to me Bradley Cooper is the star of Silver Linings Playbook. The rest of the cast was also excellent, all contributing to make this movie very enjoyable to watch, with some good giggles, but most of all an interesting story. I find stories about the ""little bit crazy"" people always fascinating to watch and in Silver Linings Playbook Cooper did a great job playing a bipolar. I wouldn't pay too much attention to the extremely negative reviews on here, those people rarely are satisfied by anything in life.",/review/rw2692295/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2012,ferguson-6,8," Excelsior Strategy
","Greetings again from the darkness. The film is exactly what you would expect from a screwball romantic comedy steeped in drama based on bipolar disorder, depression, OCD, Philadelphia Eagles fanatics, a ballroom dancing contest, adultery, Hemingway, and a lead character who jogs while wearing a trash bag. Maybe not exactly what you would expect, but more likely much more.",/review/rw2692295/?ref_=tt_urv

26 January 2013,planktonrules,9," Although the ending was awfully formulaic, the overall package is just terrific.
","The Oscars are still a few weeks away, so at this point I have no idea which awards, if any, this film will receive. I also cannot really say which ones it SHOULD receive, as I still have quite a few movies to see that were also nominated for the big awards. But I can say that the two leads were just terrific and I loved how unconventional most of the film was. I seem to have heard a lot more about how great Jennifer Lawrence was in the film--and she was AMAZING. However, I can't understand why I haven't heard at least as much about Bradley Cooper--his performance as a really screwy guy was quite convincing.",/review/rw2692295/?ref_=tt_urv

16 October 2018,brueggemankade,9," Enjoyed it
","People are saying that it's ""offensive"" and ""too happy"" to be real, and that surprises me.
As someone who lives with mental illness (severe major depression with severe psychotic features), and was in psych ward for quite a while, I didn't find it offensive. I found it to be remarkably accurate in portraying some of my own struggles, with mind-dulling medications, unwanted outbursts, deep paranoia, odd tics, etc. that I have had for over ten years.
As for the ""overly happy"" stuff? Too many movies and TV shows focus on being ""dark"" and ""edgy"", so I found it refreshing to see someone going through struggles being positive about it. I won't pretend to have had the most difficult life, but it hasn't been easy. I saw this movie a few months after I was released from psych ward (2016), and I can honestly say it gave me a bit of hope to find my own silver lining.
The world needs more positivity.",/review/rw2692295/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2013,kosmasp,8," De Niro is back
","While the big headlines might be taken by the Oscar nominated lead actors (and also Oscar winner, regarding Jennifer Lawrence), the other good news is that De Niro finally had a role he could relish in again. And a role we as viewers would actually like to see him in too. There have been a few lesser roles he played over the past couple of years. And while he is never able to completely disappoint, you won't remember him for a movie called ""Freelancers"" and others in that vain.",/review/rw2692295/?ref_=tt_urv

",This is without a doubt THE movie that launched Jennifer into stardom. And deservedly so! For all those who love Jennifer Lawrence and for some unexplicable reason havent yet seen this gem there is only advice: stop reading this review and start watching!,/review/rw2692295/?ref_=tt_urv

21 July 2018,nogodnomasters,10," MY CHERIE AMOUR
","The film centers around Patrick (Bradley Cooper), a bipolar person, who has issues. He goes into a berserk mode whenever he hears ""My Cherie Amour"" like Curly used to do when they played ""Pop Goes the Weasel."" Of course bipolar people should be introduced to other bipolar people, because you never sleep with anyone crazier than yourself.",/review/rw2692295/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2012,Nuss,10," So very much more than meets the eye
","At first glance, you would think this movie would be just another generic Katherine Heiglesque rom-com that dominates the box office and empties your soul. But classifying it as such is like saying Jaws was a nice little fishing movie. It's so very much more and what makes it all the more wonderful is that it comes as such a pleasant surprise.",/review/rw2692295/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2012,cummingsjosh7,8," Silver Linings Playbook is a refreshing addition to the rom com genre
","While most romantic comedies usually contain bad acting, sappiness, and a large amount of predictable moments; Silver Linings Playbook is the exact opposite. There may be a little amount sappiness in this movie but there is bound to be some in any romantic situations. In reality though, all of the sap in Silver Linings Playbook can be overlooked due to the fact that the film is completely original, extremely funny, and contains outstanding acting from the two lead roles.",/review/rw2692295/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2013,Hitchcoc,7," Life Is a Lot More Complicated/A Psychiatrist's Buffet
","I have to agree that Jennifer Lawrence is darn good in this. Bradley Cooper overacts with the best of them. But as I watched it unfold, I just couldn't buy into it. Of course, this is ultimately a comedy, though it is a dark comedy. Cooper is completely out of control when he is off his meds. This is pretty well presented at the beginning as he rants about getting back together with his wife (after having nearly beaten her lover to death). His strained relation with his father, a bookie/Philadelphia Eagles Fan/and a raving OCDer, is in the forefront. The dad, played by Robert DiNiro is about as off his trolley as Cooper. The mom wants everything to be nice, and is constantly caught in the middle of these ""crazy"" people. DeNiro has been banned from the Eagles' stadium because of rowdy behavior in the past and believes his not being present is the reason for their lack of success. Anyway, Cooper hooks up with Jennifer Lawrence who is newly widowed. She is also a nut case. She becomes his mother confessor and his link to getting back together with his wife. She is learning to dance and insists on his helping her with this in exchange for her participation in getting messages to his ex (there is a restraining order that keeps him from her as well as the high school where she teaches). Lost in all this is the seriousness of bipolar disorder. All the people in the movie are in serious trouble, and when the chips are down, the writer and director back off and turn it into a bit of a silly romantic comedy. Cooper is unrecognizable in the second half. Where did all the angst and despair go? These people don't have epiphanies. They are in constant battle with their disease. While it captivated me on one level, I felt it sold out and became less that it could have been.",/review/rw2692295/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2020,aidanratesmovies,10," Fantastic
","A smart, impactful, and surprisingly entertaining narrative, Silver Linings Playbook does more than an impressive job of exploring the live of those with bipolar, and provides a fantastic story along the way. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence both give fabulous performances as the leads, Pat and Tiffany, as well as Robert De Niro as Pat's father. The film is really entertaining, engaging, and interesting to watch. It can be certainly tough to view at times, but as the world around these characters are broken down and break down in the process, the film does a masterful job of making us want to root for their sides. The film is incredibly clever and well written, and the work of the book can easily be seen upon the screen, and proves to be quite an impressive feat to match. The cinematography is interesting, and honestly provides plenty of shots that i'm sure in the future will be lead to be iconic. The pacing of the film starts off slower than the rest, but this justification, is by all means a great way to start it, and will be firmly enjoyed upon my future viewing. In the end, Silver Linings Playbook is a wonderfully romantic, emotional, and very clever film. It's approach on bipolar is a tour de force, and one of the many reasons that makes this such an important work of cinema. It's entertaining, captivating, and very impactful, and will easily not be an experience I forget anytime soon.

14 December 2020,auuwws,8," Silver Linings Playbook
","The average romantic aspect of the film was excellent, but the dramatic side was poor. Jennifer Lawrence's performance was excellent and she deserved an Academy Award for her performance in the film. Bradley Cooper's performance was excellent. The body of the psychopathic character was excellent.",/review/rw2692295/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2014,MLDinTN,5," who thinks this was good? Not me
","After finally watching this over hyped film, I don't get why people think it is really good. I thought it was barely watchable because it was so boring. I don't get all the award nomination nor how Jennifer Lawerence could win an Oscar for this role. There was nothing outstanding about her character, Tiffany, to warrant a stand out role. And the worst part was the lack of chemistry between Bradly Cooper and Jennifer Lawerence. First he looks 20 years older than her, and why would a depressed widow want to hook up with a bipolar manic who has melt downs. Simple, it wouldn't happen.",/review/rw2692295/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2013,bob the moo,," Solid performances but obvious direction and writing rob it of wit, intelligence and depth
","Beyond the nominations for Oscars, I hadn't really heard much about this film so I didn't have any preconceptions to speak of and came into it blind more or less. The film focuses on two characters who are each struggling with mental and/or emotional issues that manifest themselves in acting out violently or sexually. The two get together to work on a dance project which appears to help them deal with their issues to a point, however family pressures, emotional pressure, sports pressure and just generally life doesn't just go away.",/review/rw2692295/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2013,woinaroschy_1979,5," After a great beginning, the silver lining gets lost in Hollywood happy ending
","After a great beginning, describing pretty realistically the condition of a person with a mental disorder (in this case bipolar), the movie fails completely in the last 30 minutes, where the main character suddenly gets over his obsessions and finds true love, his family wins a lot of money and his friends manage to solve their emotional and mental problems in order to celebrate the happy-ever-after couple.",/review/rw2692295/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2012,bigmystery23,10," Sooooooooooo good
","I was fortunate enough to make it into the Austin Film Festival screening of this film, and my god it was worth the wait. David O. Russel has outdone himself with this beautiful portrayal of a dysfunctional family searching for a way to come together. Bradley Cooper has won me finally with his odd and hilarious character. Jennifer Lawrence is dashing as ever with the hysterical role of Tiffany, a depressed woman trying to find a way out of her issues. This whole film has powerhouse performances, a laugh-out-loud script with heart, and a way to get the audience attached to its likable characters. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, and you are sure to see this as Osacr buzz.",/review/rw2692295/?ref_=tt_urv
