2 December 2022,Supermanfan-13,5," Was hoping it would be better!
","I was a huge fan of Supernatural so I was really looking forward to this ever since I first heard about it. I have to say after watching the first few episodes I've been disappointed. The Winchesters is the prequel to Supernatural that tells the story of how Dean and Sam's parents first met and how they got into fighting the supernatural. While it's not as good as Supernatural, not much is, I'll probably still give it a few more episodes to see if it gets better. If you're a fan of the of the original show then you should probably give this a try to see for yourself but don't have high expectations. I'm looking forward to seeing if this gets better but not expecting it to.",/review/rw8604140/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2022,DiCaprioFan13,3," Not close to as good as Supernatural
","First off, Supernatural was a lot better and this is not close to as good. It's not terrible, it's just not great either. The Winchesters is a fun show that's a prequel to Supernatural. It tells the story of how John Winchester (Drake Rodger) met Mary Campbell (Meg Donnelly). It shows how they fell in love while trying to save the world. John returns home from Vietnam and tries to find out about his father's mysterious past. Along the way he meets Mary who is also looking into her fathers past. Oh, and she's a demon hunter. They then team up to look for answers about their fathers and fight the evil supernatural events that are taking place. Jensen Ankles, who played Dean Winchester, is the narrator for this so it's nice to have the nostalgia of the original show.",/review/rw8604140/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2022,cantrelayne,3," Prequeling a series is Tough; Predating it RIGHT shouldn't be!
","I was an Instant Supernatural fan, from Day One. Was very hopeful about this series because Jensen Ackles is in charge. Now 6 eps in, very, very disappointed, and frankly insulted. You have to completely forget ""In The Beginning"" {Season 4 ep 3} , ""The Song Remains The Same"" {Season 5 Ep13} which look right, get the vernacular and clothing, as well as the details - newspapers, Tab advert, etc Right, let alone the seriousness and foundation of John and Mary. You have to forget too much of the foundation, you have to wipe it out completely! This is not about the show not being Supernatural, it's about the show being so far off that it would not be good as a stand alone.",/review/rw8604140/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,HardLight,3," SPN expletive insult towards stupid writers
","During the early 2000s there was a lot of talk about reboots and reimaginings of projects, so much so that certain creators decided to make a tongue in cheek approach towards it with parody episodes that involved using such plots and cranking the dial up to 11 on the cheese factor.",/review/rw8604140/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2022,rockdude-68045,4," Really want to like it but its just flat
",Everything is there to make this show live up to the supernatural name but it's missing something to make it do just that. It's literally like Sam & Dean 2.0 in the form of their parents with substance in the plot and immediate callbacks to the supernatural show. It obvious has a ton of potential as a show but right now it's just falling flat on the expectations I had for it. I hate to say it but the real achilles heel has been the acting so far for me. It feels like a B or C style movie/show and I try to be forgiving and invested but sometimes the acting actually takes me out of the show. I guess it just needs more time to settle in and develop but right now I'm struggling to stay committed to the show. Like I said it has potential and it's not always bad but it still has some work to do to really get things going and live up to its name. I'll change my ratings when or if that happens... until then I have to be honest and say 4/10. I find myself sometimes scrolling on my phone instead of glued to the tv like I was with the OG show.,/review/rw8604140/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2022,bcprabhu,," The road so far is pretty bad
","Sorry, Jensen but you should go back being Soldier Boy (or do something else). That was a good role but so far this show is absolute garbage and a waste of time. It brings nothing new to the established lore.",/review/rw8604140/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2022,phil_consult,3," Is this intended to fail?
","I decided to give this show a try, and binge the first six episodes. I was somewhat disappointed, and that grew to an even greater disappointment. The only things this show has common with the original series is the subject matter encompassing ""monsters"" and ""hunters"", and the Winchester namesake. Other than that, its not remotely comparable.",/review/rw8604140/?ref_=tt_urv

23 November 2022,adamkelley-75150,3," How did Jensen miss what made SN Great??
","It was never the monsters that made SN great.. It was Sam and Dean. The love they had for one another. The chemistry Jared and Jensen had. It was Cas, Crowley, Rowena, Chuck, Gabriel, etc.. All these great characters!. Hell, even Lucifer (pun intended).",/review/rw8604140/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2022,jasondutton,5," It's ok
","If you're expecting anything like supernatural then don't watch. It's a passable show, but I find the characters a bit weak. Continuity aside (a few massive clangers) it doesn't have the juxtaposed comedy of Dean with the seriousness of Sam, that I feel this type of programme needs.",/review/rw8604140/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2022,Sandre-Monroe,2," SCOOBY DOO GANG into the SCOOBY DOO BUS - The tv show

7 November 2022,AfricanBro,4," Legacies
","It's pretty low budget so the special effects aren't anything to behold, I'd say just subjacent to Legacies if you've seen it. The story seems pretty generic and the world seems like a blend of other series and movies in the genre. So despite being thrown into the middle of it you catch on pretty quick. It's fast paced but I felt slightly too quick at times, characters meet and almost instantly willing to go on parlous adventure on a whim. The introductions feel like it was pieced together pretty quickly and can't wait to get onto the next, possibly juicy part of the story. Apart from the the forced lighting and the fact that they tell you, it also doesn't feel like it's set in the 70's. Just found out it's a spin-off to Supernatural, haven't watched it yet but I guess this is the Legacies to The Originals for it. Makes sense the intros were hastily done. I was wondering why it got a lotta buzz after it only just started. The rating's probably gonna be higher than it deserves due to the fan love inherited from the parent show. A couple episodes in and I'm not yet sold, maybe if you're a fan of such shows it could be worth a try, but the more I watch the lower I wanna rate it.",/review/rw8604140/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2022,sharahill,3," Won't last, no substance
","If this wasn't linked to Supernatural you wouldn't even bother, add to that they've changed the whole backstory. This essentially is a scooby themed teenage love story without enough substance to give it a long life.",/review/rw8604140/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2022,lynnbarr-72128,5," Teen-fest
","I was looking forward to The Winchesters, but to be honest, I think this was made for a teenage audience, Supernatural was an absolutely brilliant series with good acting, story, and direction but The Winchesters just haven't got what it takes to hold an audience's interest, the main characters Mary and John were just OK, I didn't feel any connection to them, it all gives off a Scooby-Doo vibe, I was expecting to see shaggy, Velma, Fred, and Daphne come running round the corner. I may watch the rest of season one episodes but I'm not expecting a great deal this is one of those shows that is canceled after the first season.",/review/rw8604140/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2022,misiek-65485,1," Total cash grab.
","This show is a insult to the Supernatural legacy and to every true Supernatural fan. It's a total cash grab trying to squeeze every penny from Supernatural name. Really really bad premise, horrible bad casting and horrendously bad acting. I can't believe that this trash was greenlighted and Wayward Sisters didn't even get a proper chance. Please get Wayward Sisters another shot ,it would be much better than this. Or make another show about younger version of Bobby and Rufus! The words can't explain how disappointing this show is, I really wanted to like it because I miss Supernatural so much but this show is just a dumpster fire.",/review/rw8604140/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2022,jim_christine,4," Not terrible but not great either
","As a fan of the Supernatural series I was hyped to watch this prequel knowing Jensen Ackles was involved and that it might have those same qualities that made the original show so cool. So far I'm not seeing the same quality of show that Supernatural was. The acting is pretty stiff, the chemistry isn't there between characters, some are actually annoying. The effects are cheesy. The whole thing seems kind of boring. I really don't see how viewers are giving this a 10/10 rating and saying they are surprised how good it is. Have they not seen the original series ? I hope it gets better, Supernatural fans deserve better.",/review/rw8604140/?ref_=tt_urv

4 November 2022,dream_collector,1," Hardly anything about this show looks like the 1970s
","There is so much garbage on television nowadays. Oftentimes when I'm flipping through the channels, I come across a show I've never seen before, and I'm willing to give it a try, I always end up disappointed. I will start off by saying I've never watched a full episode of Supernatural. The plotlines were complicated, and the occult material gave the show such a bizarre feeling. The only positive thing I got out of it was developing a crush on Jensen Ackles (I'm a female - just thought I'd mention that to provide more context. But hey, the man is so hot, I'm sure there's other men who gush over him too). He's a thousand times more authentic than other male celebrities. Not only is he handsome and have a sexy voice, but he's also down to earth and kindhearted. However, all of that aside, I have to wonder what he was thinking to make an unnecessary prequel. It just seems like it was a poor idea. The Winchesters is basically a story of how Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean's (Jensen Ackles) parents first met each other and teamed up to fight monsters. It takes place in 1972. Their father, John (Drake Rodger), has come home from the Vietnam War, and is subsequently battling PTSD (come to think of it, if he's returning from Vietnam, wouldn't he be much older than 18?). He encounters their mother, Mary Campbell (Meg Donnelly). Other supporting characters are Latika Desa (Nida Khurshid) and a guy named Jojo Fleites (Carlos Cervantez). In terms of the writers creating an atmosphere that's evocative of the 1970s - they fell kind of short, in my opinion. I wasn't around during the 1970s, so I can't say what people were like from experience. I watch a lot of TV shows and movies from the 1970s, so I have an idea of how people talked and dressed. Besides Mary and Latika wearing bell bottoms, and Jojo having long hair, nothing about this show gives off 1970s vibes. The characters' dialogue and mannerisms reminded me of teenagers in this time period more so than 1972. I also question the casting of minority actors and actresses, because they seem misplaced. Jojo is not only Hispanic, but he's also gay. He's not flamboyant, but he doesn't hide his sexuality either. I can't help but wonder if a gay teenager would've been so out and expressive in the 1970s. Stonewall was in 1969, so I'm sure after that event, gay people felt more comfortable being themselves than previous years. But that was New York City, and in the case of The Winchesters, we're talking about a small town in Kansas. I can't see a gay adolescent, Hispanic or any other race, making it obvious they're gay in public without fear of harm to their safety. Plus Latika is Pakistani-American. Were any non-white people living in rural Kansas in the 1970s??? Very few period pieces present an accurate picture of the decade they're trying to portray. I feel like TV writers need to stop going to such great lengths to make everything politically correct when they're creating a show that takes place in the 20th century, and to just focus on doing research to see what that particular decade - not just the 1970s, but the 1940s, 1950s, or anytime before the year 2000 - was actually like. The Winchesters is more or less a show for kids. Not super young though - I would say middle school. As for young adults who love anything nostalgic, I can't see them caring for this. I'll be surprised if it lasts for more than a few seasons.",/review/rw8604140/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2022,HorrorFilmHellion,2," This is just plain bad.. in every way.
","This is the typical dreck you expect from CW, except now they hire an army of fake reviewers to go rate every new pilot they come out with as a perfect 10.. same thing happening with Walker Independence. Don't take my word for it, check out the reviewer's profiles yourself. The casting on this is horrific.. the period portion of this piece is completely off. It's not good to look at. The characters are miscast and super ham-fisted. It's painfully woke. Worst of all, it feels like the worst part of what SPN became (boring snoozefest) before it finally ended. SPN was awesome in the first few seasons, and had the Kripke magic. This absolutely does not, which is a heck of a bad start right out of the gate.",/review/rw8604140/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2022,Jim_E_Cornette,4," Someone tell Jensen: retcons stink

12 October 2022,bellab1972,2," NOT SMART OR FUNNY and has NO SOUL!
","Supernatural was an epic show with so much heart and soul with a sensational cast that made the show! Here we have a spin off attempting to piggy back off of Supernaturals popularity but it's a dismal failure! We start with the timeline and events being totally wrong. We leant in Supernatural John Winchester didn't know about demons etc and Mary was the hunter who tried to hide it from John and have a normal family life. But, apparently here John learns about supernatural beings from the moment he meets Mary.",/review/rw8604140/?ref_=tt_urv
