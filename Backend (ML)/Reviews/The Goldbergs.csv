26 February 2022,Jeroenvandermeer,6," Messing with history
","Show is not as bad as people want you to believe by giving a minimal rating. But there are some major issues. They try to combine the original series with some The last kingdom and it not a good thing. But what really made me cringe is the adding of a black Viking leader. That's just complete nonsense. The woke sickness should stop. And the invention of the surfboard? Come on, just don't. It's all just messing with history.",/review/rw7917112/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2022,gabrielguerena-47860,8," Garbage political correctness in a good show
","First of all, this is nothing like the first Vikings series even after the huge success of Ragnar's story I find hard to believe they couldn't find a big budget. Some of the acting is meh, some is bad but the protagonists are just decent and that works. CGI is mediocre.",/review/rw7917112/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2022,alexleizerovichcoaching,6," This feels like the last seasons of Vikings
",Unfortunately this feels exactly like the last seasons of Vikings post Ragnar's death. If you compare this to the Ragnar era there is no comparison. Something about the first seasons with Ragnar was special and magical. It took the time to build the story and the characters. The last seasons of Vikings were pretty boring and repetitive. Valhalla really reminds me of them.,/review/rw7917112/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2022,random-70778,," An anachronism a minute, pale follow-on to great series.
","Firstly the people claiming that there are fake low rating reviews here are way off base. The full season dropped on Netflix in Europe nearly 20 hours ago, and the first negative review occurred 14 hours ago, plenty of time to have seen eight total 50 minute episodes. So let's talk about the show, not downvoting claimed to be fake by other people who don't know how netflix works across continents.",/review/rw7917112/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Very Entertaining!
","When I first heard about Vikings: Valhalla I couldn't wait to see it. I knew it was going to be hard to live up to the original but this not not only met my expectations but surpassed them in every way. Of course it wasn't as good as the original, I wasn't expecting it to but it's still a very good show that can stand on its own. I actually liked it so much that I binged the entire first season over a weekend. Now season 2 just came out and I did the same thing...I binged it as fast as possible. Both seasons have been great! I know it's already gotten an early renewal for a third season so it's obviously getting good ratings. I hope this last as long as the original as I look forward to seeing where this story goes. The more Vikings the better!",/review/rw7917112/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,Carambotti,8," Tough act to follow the original
","This show has big shoes to wear after the wild success of the 2013 Vikings series. It very much is the junior brother to that series, as it turns out.",/review/rw7917112/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2022,georgewhittingham1,6," Meh
","Sadly painfully average. It has its moments, but it's main issue I would say is the lack of character development. 8 episodes that takes us between England and Norway, trying to give us 3 main characters, but introducing more and more along the way.",/review/rw7917112/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,PartialMovieViewer,8," Looked Cold
","What can I say? When I watch a movie that is supposedly based on fact, I figure that very little is historical. I read on the internet, that all Vikings were really woke and awfully nice people. Of course I posted those words after watching a couple of episodes. Suggestion: toss the history aspect and change up the scenery for a different planet; costumes to space suits; horses become dinosaurs and tinker with the plot some - and - voila! Think about it, ""Vikings in Space."" I like it. Grab on to it, write something original. Go out on that limb. I shouldn't knock the author of the greatest Christmas movie ever - 'Die Hard' is unbeatable. But tell me why pick on the British or English or Saxons - can't we all just get along? Anyway, a movie, for me, it just has to be enjoyable. Putting PC aside, it really turned into a pretty goods series. Will I watch it again? I don't know, it's getting hard to digest too much more of Hollywierd's screen-vomit, which this, really isn't. I detect some hard arm twisting took place, just to get this to the point where it was acceptable to the studio czars. I really want to see something without the wokeness. I had raise my first score, it is enjoyable, even without the space suits.",/review/rw7917112/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2022,LuvBinks,6," Vikings Valhalla crossed the line!!!!!!!
","There's not much too say besides the fact the they put a black woman in charge of Kattegat... ridiculous you are right this is insane I like too be enthralled in the atmosphere of history, you completely rejected history and culture and this is something truly sad to see. I have nothing to say besides thanks for wasting my time and the potential of the Vikings reboot.",/review/rw7917112/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,Diviana-83,8," Enjoyable
","I enjoyed the series, even though I don't agree with casting a black actress for the role of a Viking Ruler. I think this show worked for me because of the story (even though not historically accurate) and the atmosphere they managed to create. I did manage to care for the fate of some of the characters, unlike other viewers...",/review/rw7917112/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,yahaira-729-694701,6," Viking's valhala is are boring
","I was looking forward to this series since the Vikings- Ragnar was such a great series on the H channel which makes this netflix production to be a boring soap opera and not historically correct. I agree with most reviews that its wrong to make the historical fictions woke. It takes away the reality. Lets face that its not real for a viking culture to put a woman from African lands to be queen of Kattegatt given that ascension to the throne is along family or clan lines. That does not disclude that people of other races, be they slaves or warriors could have neen sold traded or stolen from the Romans with whom the vikings did business and battle with. I agree there isnt the passion and drama of Ragna, here with the characters whom appear to be 2 dimensional, however characters develop and story gets goid by episode 4. Its worth watching.",/review/rw7917112/?ref_=tt_urv

26 February 2022,shanejmullan,8," Cheap and tacky woke copycat
","Cheap and tacky woke copycat. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME. I don't know how this reached Netflix's number 1 for today. What is the world coming to.. Some completely poor actor choices, trying to re-write history to suit their own activist agendas.",/review/rw7917112/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2022,dtaarin,8," Woke Netflixification a parody of Viking culture
","1000 years ago Judeochristian invaders destroyed pagan culture not (only) by cutting throats but by over-coding, by synchretism, by over-writing pagan culture until it was dead in all but image. Netflix are doing the same again. This show projects a woke assault on a culture Netflixies probably despise.",/review/rw7917112/?ref_=tt_urv

1 September 2022,poetictank,10," What's with all the hate?
","Seriously, what's with all the negative reviews? It's a little fishy to me. Vikings, the original series, was definitely much better, especially in its first few seasons. However, the original show became so mediocre in its last 2 or 3 seasons. It was so messy.",/review/rw7917112/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2023,postmeiska,7," It Grew On Me
","I imagine, like many other reviewers, the series we compared this to is the History channel's, Vikings. That was a truly outstanding and unexpected series with my vote being a 10. So, when this came along I was not thinking it would meet that mark. I was right in that assumption. The actors, acting, storytelling and overall production simply could not compare. This was especially true of the first season. However, by the second season there was improvement enough for me to to continue with it. By the end of the second season there was enough development of the storyline, and improvement in other areas, to make it entertaining especially since I enjoy content from this period of history. Hopefully the third season will step it up. BTW, if you haven't already seen 'Vikings' you can pick the 6 seasons up on several streaming services.",/review/rw7917112/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2022,bshaef,8," original series is much better
","Because of cooler characters;'= - Ivar thr Bonless, Loki,, Ragnar, and so on and the story was better but scenery was equal to first series. Enjoyed watching both but #1 held my attention all the way through and in this one I kind of lost interest. Battle scenes were too repetitive.",/review/rw7917112/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2022,nourdinb,6," It lacks the previous Vikings charisma
","They've chosen the wrong actors. They don't have as much charisma as previous Vikings actors like Ragnar, Floki, Rollo, Lagertha, Bjorn and King Harald. These guys have friendly looks, talk English with a ""nice try"" accent. No face tattoos and all. It just doesn't appeal to me as much as the real Vikings.",/review/rw7917112/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,smartsug2002,9," Crimes on the name of church
",One of the great shows that highlights the crime committed on the name of church. This belief that my faith is better than others has destroyed this world. Both major abhramic religions have killed millions on the name of sending people to heaven. Hope this stops now. As a pagan myself i have seen the crimes myself. Bombings in various places by believers of one God and forced conversion by the followers of others. Request you all who are rating this show as 1 to read yourself on how pagan cultures across the world was destroyed and still getting destroyed. Hope you all reflect yourself and request pope to stop this now.,/review/rw7917112/?ref_=tt_urv
