24 August 2022,FeastMode,2," The writers/director clearly have never owned a cat
","Other headlines I thought about using are ""Rooting for the lion"" and simply ""Idiots."" This movie is so dumb. And this is coming from someone who frequently enjoys dumb stuff. I'm the target audience for this type of movie. Yet I couldn't stop noticing how dumb everything was.",/review/rw8468933/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,AfricanBro,3," I was fuming
","I had to rewrite this because the first one was more of a rant with spoilers. You know those moments someone attempts to be a hero and somebody else goes ""you're either really brave, or really stupid"", well this is full of the latter. All the main actors keep making the most illogical decisions and the beast hunting them's actions also didn't make sense. Somebody said the writers think we're stupid. Idris Elba deserves better than this, even he couldn't save it. The script sucked, tries to hold emotional weight at times but it either falls flat or feels forced, especially from the stubborn daughter. Camera work sucked too, it looked like it was filmed by a regular guy walking around with a camera, not a professional especially when following in tight spaces, it was unstable. At times, it's like those videos of a school fight and the person recording keeps moving around and it's just commotion. It also starts out like a horror and is full of jump scares, still deciding if that's a good thing or not. I however loved that they cast locals for this, because that ""African accent"" Hollywood likes to use bugs me because I've never met anyone who speaks like that; like some director in the 80's decided this is how we sound and Hollywood still oblivious to it years later. So points for the accent. But the movie's still not worth the watch, it's just a family with really bad survival instincts and I haven't been this infuriated during a movie in recent memory. One of those movies that makes you wanna reach into the screen and knock some sense into the characters.",/review/rw8468933/?ref_=tt_urv

24 August 2022,RedandBlueBulldog,6," Sleep Mode Not Beast Mode. Rule #342 of Bad Movies: Kids In Survival/Disaster Films Are Totally Annoying!
","I had high hopes for this film. The trailer seems interesting enough. Idris Elba and Sharlto Copley are always good in their roles and here it's no different. This movie just doesn't have it. I wanted to like it. I tried so hard to like it, but ultimately it doesn't do its job. It doesn't strike fear into the hearts of men or anyone else for that matter. It does, however get on your last nerve. All because of the kids in this movie. It's always the kids. The kids, as in other films, get in the way. They distract. They do stupid stuff. They say stupid stuff at tense moments thus shattering said tension. As already stated, not even Elba or Copley can spiff this baby up. It's a mess.",/review/rw8468933/?ref_=tt_urv

","Ridiculous, annoying actor/character actions will make you want to feed these people to the lion. Especially the older daughter. I've not been this annoyed by a character in a long time. I think we are supposed to feel for her plight and her fear but all I wanted to do was to make her shut up. Even before the lion came.",/review/rw8468933/?ref_=tt_urv

","How a dad, a child and a teenager fight a monstrous lion with punches and kicks to prevent him from getting into a car, and to hear every 2 minutes sentences like: ok it's fine, don't worry, he tore my leg, it hurts, I'm bleeding out and I'm fainting but don't worry, we'll be fine and you know how much i loved your mom? And do you want to see how this monstrous lion is not killed by heavily armed poachers and hunters but is eventually subdued by other lions including an injured lioness ?

18 August 2022,ferguson-6,5," Idris Elba punches a lion
","Greetings again from the darkness. Movies featuring man versus beast date back to at least 1933 with KING KONG, and have proven to be fan favorites many times since, likely peaking with JAWS in 1975. Of course, this sub-genre has also produced too many flops to count as low-budget filmmakers have attempted to capitalize with the cheap-thrills approach to entertainment. Director Baltasar Kormakur has previously flashed his skill with nature thrillers ADRIFT (2018) and EVEREST (2015), and here he's working from a script and story by Ryan Engle (NON-STOP, 2014) and Jaime Premak Sullivan (BREAKING IN, 2018). It's tempting to call this one 'Cujo as a lion', as a tip of the cap to the 1983 adaptation of Stephen King's horror-novel, but there are many reasons not to do so.",/review/rw8468933/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,nscoby93,3," I had no expectations going in but holy damn was that bad
","There's not a lot of good here so let's get straight to what little is done right. The first act is what carries this film, it was so well done and entertaining. The scenery and establishing shots of the African landscape were beautiful it made me wish I was watching this film on a bigger screen. The introduction to these characters was fine enough, I was intrigued to learn more. Idris Elba was great he's a fine actor, his co-star Sharlto Copley was great in his supporting role they both had great chemistry. This first act culminates in a fantastic scene where this village is massacred, it made for some great tension some horrific scenery.",/review/rw8468933/?ref_=tt_urv

","Experiencing this movie would be a living hell for me. Give me a serial killer chasing me over this any day of the week.

16 September 2022,JackCowart34,6," A Man's Fight Against Death Incarnate
","Beast delivers on its core premise but fails to exceed expectations. To elaborate, occasionally you'll attend a movie for one reason and end up appreciating it for a different reason all together. This is not one of those movies. However, there are a few outlier scenes within the film that are far superior to the baseline the movie sets for itself. My personal favorite is a truly touching monologue delivered by Elba in the first act of the film in which he expresses his regret at his inability to save his wife from terminal cancer. Another, obviously, is the brutal fight scene between Elba and the lion in the final act that is sure to cause the more delicate audience members to look away. As for me, my eyes were glued to the screen. Unfortunately, the writing stymied the film's momentum, as the middle third struggled to bridge the gap between the onset of the attack and the climactic ending. The children's characters weren't particularly well realized either, partly because of their decision-making (which you can also attribute to the writing), and partly because of subpar acting. But ultimately, you pretty much get what you expect: Idris Elba going to war against a massive lion to protect his family.",/review/rw8468933/?ref_=tt_urv

","Those girls drove me NUTS! They don't listen to any their father says even when their lives depend on it. They are always talking over him and asking stupid questions. The movie would have been better without those two annoying characters. If those two idiots are edited out of the move I give it a 6/10 rating. Mr. Elba is always good and there is a lot of action and suspense. You can almost sense how hot it is in Africa and and without reliable communication (phone, radio or cell phone), how fragile life can be, even IF you're not being stalked by an angry lion who, sadly, had his pride murdered by poachers.",/review/rw8468933/?ref_=tt_urv
