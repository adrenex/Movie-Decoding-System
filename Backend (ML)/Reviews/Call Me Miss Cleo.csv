22 May 2017,elizrug,9," Relatable characters and interesting story line
","I don't like shows full of fake pretty Hollywood actors. This series has beautiful women and men, maybe not in the fake Hollywood standards, which gives it so much more realness. The characters are complex in their different personalities without going overboard in their acting.",/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2021,DKosty123,8," British Series Not For PBS
","If you know the meaning of Harlot, it is no surprise this is not really family viewing content. Set in 1763 London, England we have the wealthy and the poor working women trying to work their way up into nobility. Of course the work is physical and calls for much foreplay. We have the feud between Quigley and Welles. Even though they are battling, they are also connected by strong life long ties, bound together with love and hate for one another.",/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2017,PowerSheetAI,9," Game of Brothels - Betrayal, Politics, Sex and Revenge in the Struggle to Become Queen of Whores
","Surprisingly addicting. Game of Throne-esque betrayal, alliances, bribery, coercion, corruption, politics, sex, and revenge.",/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2020,dtlacey78,10," Love. Love. Love it!
","Sex. Drinking. Swearing. Romance. Comedy. Tear-inducing drama. I'm totally in love with this series. Chock full of throughly loveable characters and equally detestable characters.
The whole cast are outstanding from the household names like Samantha Morton, Lesley Manville Dorothy Atkinson & Liv Tyler to the lesser known but just as superb Hollie Dempsie, Eloise Smyth & Jessica Brown Findlay.
I've recommended this to many friends & family and every single one of them has thanked me for it.
I urge everyone to guve this a go. I guarantee you will be hooked after the first episode.
I'm holding out for series 4 to be commissioned by a major network soon!",/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2017,kekrauss,8," Portrayal of black people in 1700's London
","After the previous reviewer's tirade about including black people as just being PC and pandering, I was curious and did a little research of my own. According to an historian's article on the history of black people in Britain (which is near the top of google results for ""black people in 1700's England) it seems the portrayal in Harlots is spot on. Everything from interracial couples in the lower classes to servants in aristocratic households and a lot of other interesting things I had no idea about.",/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2017,PanicStation,9," Thought Id hate it....very wrong!
","I just wanted to say that this programme is so much better than I thought it would be. I actually care about the characters. I don't usually like full on sex scenes, but because of the subject matter it doesn't seem gratuitous. It's actually a very fascinating insight into 18th Century England, and seems that it was a very complicated lifestyle to live in a brothel as well as dangerous. I'm enjoying it. Give it a go.",/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2018,hylandnwolf,," A Delectably Binge-Worthy Series!!!
","Indulge yourself and watch this series!!! The rating doesn't do it any justice! I found that I became further enthralled as the show progressed. Brilliant acting, with a fabulous cast. A very well written series indeed.",/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2017,bjarias,8," ..don't discount it.. it is a guilty-pleasure
","..it's an interesting show.. part period piece.. part soft-core sex-soap.. but pretty much so far.. total fun.. and the cast across the board is pretty darn good, and with some very noteworthy leads.. the couple really jump out are Samantha Morton and Jessica Brown Findlay.. they both are just outstanding.. Morton has been around well before in numerous productions, always doing top-notch work.. as for JBF, this is a breakout role.. she is perfect and makes the absolute most of her character.. in today's world she'd be one of the highest paid, and most sought after hi-end escorts in the business.. after the first episode was not so sure how things would go.. but now seeing four parts, it's can't hardly wait for more.. to stay fresh they will need to remain very creative.. really hope they are up to the task.. it might be the worlds oldest profession, but throughout TV land, it's been one of the most difficult story-line genres to keep alive long term",/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2020,simmsmaggy,7," A great binge watch - 'Eastenders' in cosplay
","The costumes and context are gloriously detailed and accurate, from the filthiness of 18th century life in general to the cosmopolitan societies of port cities like London. The costumes and settings are based on 18th century 'real' examples, which for me gives the series a hallmark of quality. The dilemma of how people would have spoken and behaved is avoided by giving the characters 21st century reactions to 18th century situations. So you can choose to be a geeky historian, and look for the bits to criticise, or just sit back and enjoy it. The screenplay seems to slip rather in series three which involved so many doors being knocked on in one episode that I got dizzy.",/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2021,Headturner1,7," Pretty good
",It's like someone copy and pasted the same reviews over and over re worded. Ok. I came upon this the other night with exhausting pretty much everything I thought I'd try this. I was surprised to see there were 3 seasons and I'd never heard of it and new it would be pretty good if they made 3 seasons. I started watching and was like wow. Before I new it I was 5 episodes in. I just finished all 3 last night. What I didn't like maybe spoilers:,/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2017,ericwilson10,8," Gets better and better, with excellent cast performances.
","I started watching this, as I had no other series lined up, saw a trailer and quite like Samantha Morton as an actress. The first episode left me a little nonplussed, as I thought it seemed a little more lightweight than I was expecting. Perhaps even gratuitous and shallow. But I stuck with it, and by episode three was hooked. Easily as good as Peaky Blinders, which is high praise indeed from an avid watcher. The characters seem to develop well and the casting is excellent. The portrayal of the Bawds from both Samantha Morton and Lesley Manville are magnificent, and a superb supporting cast brings the piece to life. It seems odd that ITV in the UK have hidden this gem away as I can only assume that it is an expensive series to produce. A mainstream channel release is surely overdue, and a budget increase for the second series must be imminent.",/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2017,earthboli,7," Well-Written Period Drama That Loses Steam
","Superficially, one might think that this show is a bawdy romp in Georgian England (18th century), but it is so much more. Written and directed by women, this show depicts the harsh realities for women during the 18th century, when they had few options but to be a man's property. Refreshingly, this show features women at center stage of the entire show, with men being the side characters that support the stellar female cast.",/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2017,Phantom_Duck,10," One of the very best dramas I have seen, a 12 of 10
","Amazing, the story, the casting, the writing, aesthetics were stunning. Acting direction, set decoration, cinematography, editing were breathtaking. The costumes are above Oscar caliber. Sheer perfection from every department.",/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2019,emuir-1,10," On a scale of 1-10, this rates an 11.
","A hilarious bawdy farce set in Hogarth's Gin Lane, at least Season One, as Season Two became darker, but even so, the script was witty, stinging and salty. If the soft corn porn and rather too graphic sex scenes had been cut out, this would still be a brilliant and addictive show. The cast don't just chew the scenery, they swallow it whole, and the acting pulls out all the stops. Samantha Morton is magnificent in her 'don't mess with me' role, sailing into a room like a ship in full sail, then switching from quiet ingratiating tones to a raucous bellow as she yells upstairs to her girls. Lesley Manville, as you have never seen her before, moves between caring and solicitous, to conceiving, vicious. vengeful and manipulative.",/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2020,dcarroll74,10," Brilliant
","I watched, I saw, and I cried. I detest the abuse of women, and the abuse of ""non whites"". This was an eye opener on a subject that most find abhorent, not the abuse but, prostitution. Cudos to those that wrote, produced, directed but, most of all; portrayed all that is abhorent in men AND women's persuit of, I have no idea, or at least, I cannot scribe in less than a bookfold.",/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2018,zohal-13239,10," brilliant writing....absolutely delicious
","I watched this first season 3 times so far. It's so good! The actors & actresses are actually good-looking (sorry but this is sometimes a big factor for me when I watch british shows). And the acting is great. The music is not genre-direct but still works well. The show is created a bit edgy, which I like. The best part for me is the writing! The writing is just amazing. The writer really knows how to illustrate both sleazy & holy, with varying degrees of comedy & wholeheartedness. Honestly, this is the closest I have ever heard of in a show where the writing and acting mimics the older generation of my female relatives when they talk amongst their own gender in a sexual-direct comedy form but, of course, this is boosted sexually 10xs. (I am not american-born, by the way- I am afghan born, uzbek ancestry, american raised) Great job, all you guys!",/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2020,dogonlion,8," Absolutely superb! Horrible music!
",This series shows a world where sex is had fully clothed. Those scenes are the funniest. The show is entertaining 100 percent of the time though. The soundtrack is horrible. Watching scenes of the 19th century era with hip hop or EDM music in the background is just ridiculous,/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2018,barbaraproencataveira,9," Deliciously outsanding, so much more than sex
","A few days ago i found myself bored and craving a period drama, I was looking for a movie when I came across Harlots and decided to give it a go. 
I was not disapointed at all. The reason why I think Harlots is so underrated is because it is a TV show about women to women. The fact that this story is about prostitutes may decieve us into thinking it will be a superficial show. Well we couldn't be more wrong about that, and the fact that that idea still crosses our mind is exactly the reason why a show like Harlots was needed. Centuries after this story we still find ourselfs judging other women based on their sexual past. 
If you are watching this show in hope to see some silly prostitutes with no brains then you might as well give up. The characters are sublime, interesting, smart, strong women. 
As the show went on i found myself falling in love over and over again with Charlotte Wells, she's simply superb. You can't help but love the forbidden love story of Violet and Amelia. And a few episodes in you'll find yourself feeling Margaret's pain and struggle of loving their daughters while managing a dangerous business. Lucy is the perfect the sweet inocent girl-next-door with a touch of a dark side. The cast is amazing and carries their characters beautifully through the story. (The dresses are breathtaking, may I add).
This show is seductive, smart and deals with important timeless issues. So grab on a cup of tea and a blanket and get ready to binge watch Harlots. I promise, it's so much more than sex.",/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2020,mgumsley,7," Original, but Fast becoming like 'Killing Eve' in 18th century London
","When this series started, I really enjoyed the bawdy, campy fun and the over the top acting performances, but now we are well into Series 2 the obsession of these two brothel owners,, i.e. Lesley Manville and Samantha Morton, is beginning to wear a little thin.
Don't get me wrong. The idea is great, showing a warts and all London full of too many bored rich men spending time and money with women of loose morals. There is nothing new about that, and the actors are great throughout, especially Manville and Morton.
The series has also been interesting for the way it depicts the exploitation of women at the time and how ruthless men were. Actually in this series, the men are not really memorable at all, except for the black men, who are more kind hearted, and Lesley Manville's son who has an absolute ball romping with the prostitutes at both borothels.
Beautiful costumes, lovely sets and wonderful period detail has kept my interest so far, but 'Killing Eve' somehow always lurks in the shadows when I watch this series.",/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2019,etiennestories,8," Well done series, but needs a new background score
","My partner and I are really enjoying this series. The writing is great; the settings see authentic; and as one who has studied costume design, he says the costumes are spot on.",/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2017,rustyhotchips12,8," Good Original Program
",SO far I have only watched 3 episodes but they were all watched in a row as I first just started watching to see if it was any good. Well 3 later and I am hooked. I think Harlots has some good writing and is not at all gratuitous in any way for a show about prostitution. People on here that are trashing it are probably holy rollers that are so uncomfortable with their own sexuality that they cant bother to see it done by others. Other than that I really started watching because of Jessica Brown Findlay. I really enjoyed her in Downton Abbey and was excited to see her in another television series. Well she has not disappointed. Neither has the rest of the cast. I will enjoy the rest of the season and future seasons to come. Very worth your time!!,/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2018,laurynl,9," While not historically accurate, great dramedy
","I really love this show. It has great story, complex characters, and politics. I like that it shows the side from women's perspective back in Georgian society in England. My only bother is that it can be unbelievable. For instance, when Charlotte outs Howard for raping her at the dinner table, all of his friends instantly believe her and cast him aside. This never would've happened back in the day, unfortunately. But it is nice to imagine. Otherwise magnificent show!",/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2021,A-Pioneer-Without-A-Frontier,7," Missed opportunities
","...And so many of them. Everything felt so rushed, especially in the end, even though it took three seasons to finish a quite a simple story. No proper depth to most of the characters, there was no time at all for normal everyday life, because the mediocre writing depended on the constant chaos and catastrophe as a smoke screen.",/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2017,scarlet812-593-111967,9," Very Guilty Pleasure
","This show is not for the faint of heart, but it's delicious entertainment if you can stomach it. As to be expected from the title, there are a lot of graphic sex scenes; you'll also encounter a great deal of profanity and a fair amount of violence. I've watched all the available episodes and can't wait to see more. The basic plot of two rival brothels quickly becomes a complicated tangle of relationships, grudges, and secrets. There are several very interesting story lines, fascinating characters, and an ongoing mystery to keep you engaged. The two rival madams in the show have well- developed characters, a realistic mix of good and bad. The decisions they make regarding their own lives, their children's' lives, and their employees' lives are at times brutal and at other times very sentimental. Some characters in the show are pretty one-dimensional, but most are realistically portrayed as very human in their inconsistencies. It's hard to believe the things that go on, but as a history buff, I will say a lot of it is probably not too far out of the realm of accuracy. I got the free trial of Hulu for The Handmaid's Tale, and between that show & Harlots, I think I will have to keep a subscription to Hulu.",/review/rw3739548/?ref_=tt_urv
