4 July 2014,CalRhys,," A Captivating Mix Of Contemporary And Retro Aesthetics
","'Drive' is a visceral and brilliantly executed vision of art-house action; possibly one of the greatest art-house films to have graced the screen. Nicolas Winding Refn has created a stylised neo-noir thriller that is simply stunning; full of glorified violence and stroking imagery. The soundtrack is amazing, fully reflecting the films mood, whilst attempting to create an atmospheric feel to accompany the gritty action. 'Drive' is a captivating mix of contemporary and retro aesthetics. A stylish and taut thriller that keeps the audience entertained from start to finish with breathtaking sequences, brutal violence and stunning cinematography, a modern masterpiece that has truly redefined the noir genre.",/review/rw2495927/?ref_=tt_urv

","Drive is different, intense, brutal and simple, Drive is not like any other thief action film with a loud music, lot of gunshot, jump from here to there, it's not, Drive is a face pacing movie that will keep you interested every single second of it, fills with incredible performance by all the cast especially Ryan Gosling, Drive is a great time.",/review/rw2495927/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2011,colinrgeorge,," Intelligent Adrenaline
","After a summer of cheap thrills, Drive delivers thrills on the cheap. With a budget Michael Bay might have allocated for a single effects sequence in Transformers 3, Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn made one of the best movies of the year. Following Bronson and Valhalla Rising, Refn crafts his most polished, commercial work yet, while retaining all the ambiguity and unbridled aggression of his tough-as-nails art house pictures.",/review/rw2495927/?ref_=tt_urv

26 September 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10," A contender for my favourite of the year so far?
","Yes, very likely. Of a very hit-and-miss year so far, I have seen some gems like Tree of Life, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy(the first two in a way are not for everybody though), Rio and Source Code. And then I saw Drive, which was simply brilliant.",/review/rw2495927/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2012,planktonrules,7," Amazingly violent....so beware.
","I should point out at the onset that this really isn't the sort of film I like--so keep this in mind. I decided to watch ""Drive"" because it received a lot of critical attention but was ignored at the Oscars. And, since I'd heard so much good stuff about it, I decided to rent it.",/review/rw2495927/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2012,Smells_Like_Cheese,9," Reminder on why we love movies
","Last year one of the big films that I think was a surprise hit was called Drive. I was always curious to see this movie, but unfortunately missed it. From what I had heard it was a must see so I rented it and absolutely fell in love with it. Reminding me a bit of the old action movies from the 70's and 80's with those great old cars that could take one heck of a beating with the anti-hero who wins your heart over and then we get a million sequels trying to out bank the previous film. Anyways, Drive offers something different, a new cult classic for a generation that is a bit ADD, this gives you something exciting or great to watch each second. I can't tell you what an amazing opening chase scene they choreographed, not to mention some very exciting action scenes. Ryan Gosling continues to be a star on the high rise proving his leading man qualities and to be an action star, he just steals the show as Driver.",/review/rw2495927/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2011,blackmambamark,9," An art-house action flick at it's finest
","I think we all remember hearing about Ryan Gosling right after 'The Notebook' came out. Most men, including myself, neglected the man on his acting ability. It's not a good reason to not really appreciate an actor. But when it comes to romantic flicks like that, i'm not really keen on the subject, or it's actors for that matter. But film by film, this man is starting to impress the hell out of me. Now it's about time to see what kind of chops this man has when it comes to an action film.",/review/rw2495927/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2011,kgprophet,8," Great use of Subtlety
","It would be difficult to write about parts of the storyline in this film, because many expectations change when the consequences of one event folds upon another. A terrific original screenplay defies Hollywood conventions of over-the-top plot convolutions and unrealistic twists. Sure, there are a couple coincidences, but there are many rewards for keeping the story simplified and enhance the characters' arcs. The director borrows heavily from Michael Mann in painting a cool atmosphere with glistening city lights at night and a throbbing synthesiser soundtrack. The film elevates itself above any other similar film in it's drama, perhaps better than the character rich film ""The Town"" from 2010. The editing emphasises the main character's withdrawn persona, hiding his emotions (indirectly hinting at his criminal past) while romancing his neighbour. Moments in conversation where a 'normal' person would express their feelings or be more extroverted, are instead tension filled passages of silence that speak louder than words. With great use of subtlety, the film does wonders in terms of depicting the main character's withdrawn mental state, but still visualising his thoughts and intentions without direct exposition.",/review/rw2495927/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2011,greekmuse,6," Most overrated movie of 2011
","Wow!! Did I miss something here? The biggest drawback of this movie is the plot: it's barely believable and lacking in substance. While the soundtrack is very good, it also cannot save the weak dialogue which is mostly Ryan Gosling staring at people and things and not saying much at all -- we're supposed to think that's really cool. He also likes to wear that scorpion jacket even when it's been bloodied. Becoming best buddies with the neighbor's kid on the first try - really? And then willing to risk his life even after the neighbor's boyfriend comes back from prison even though she previously hit on him - really? Also, outsmarting a police helicopter in LA in the first chase scene - really?",/review/rw2495927/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2014,Leofwine_draca,9," Simply wonderful
","Nicolas Winding Refn's previous film, VALHALLA RISING, an existential Viking epic with Mads Mikkelsen, was a breath of fresh air for this tired reviewer. I immediately marked out Refn as somebody to watch, and while his prison biopic BRONSON was a little disappointing, I waited with interest to see what his next movie would be. Well, DRIVE was it, and the good news is that it's his best one yet.",/review/rw2495927/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2011,markdroulston,9," Fantastic retro action with art-house flair!
","It seems to be the case nowadays that film audiences, particularly at this time of year as the summer winds down, are left with a choice of seeing the latest broad appeal movies filling the multiplexes, or venturing to the local independent cinema in search of more intellectual fare. Very rarely will a film transcend these boundaries and offer a mix of Hollywood-style action and art-house flair, which is what makes Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive so unique and something to be celebrated.",/review/rw2495927/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2017,sddavis63,1," The Very Definition Of ""Dreadful""
","Seriously - there are times when I just don't get this site. I get that people have different tastes in movies - but this movie has a ridiculously high rating. To be perfectly blunt about it - it's dreadful. If you look up the word ""dreadful"" in the dictionary, I'm sure that there will be some reference to ""Drive"" in the definition. It takes almost half the movie before we really get a sense of where this is going - and even then it doesn't become very interesting. It's ridiculously and often graphically bloody and makes terrible use of bad music to try to build suspense.",/review/rw2495927/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2018,austinfromdahood,10," NWR's best film, one of my all time favorites
","When I started to get interested into film, I somehow started watching movie reviews on YouTube, and my favorite YouTube movie critic was and still is, Chris Stuckmann. After binge watching many of his videos, I found out that one of his favorite films is Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive. I decided to watch it one day, and I was very mixed on it at first. I then watched Chris Stuckmann's Analyzed video on Drive, but after that, I still didn't understand the movie too much. Then, one day, I just had the urge to watch it again. I don't know why, I just did, but watching it the 2nd time was a very mesmerizing experience. The soundtrack, the cinematography, the acting, and it's complex story makes Drive one of my favorite films of all time. Many people did not like this movie upon its release, and I think it is because of its misleading marketing. The trailers for Drive make it seems like the movie is a straight up action film with the utterly handsome Ryan Gosling in the leading role. The movie is actually a meticulously crafted neo-noir film that doesn't concentrate on the action, but on its complex story. This film is not only one of my favorite arthouse films, but one of my all time favorites.",/review/rw2495927/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2011,evansweet1214,10," A Tense and Often Beautiful Masterpiece.
","You might hear one comparing this to a Tarantino film, but leave all worries at the door, this is an absorbing and tremendously unique piece of cinema from Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn. The reason it works so exquisitely well is because the film grabs hold of you and takes you inside this often dark and dream-like LA setting. So, when the end of the film hits, you feel apart of this film, and it's there to stay.",/review/rw2495927/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2011,MidnightMax,9," Best Film of 2011: ""Drive""
","At the Theater- ""Drive"" -- This is not an Action film, this is not a ""Car"" movie- It's a character-driven, slow-burn thriller of the first order that features elements of some of the finer works from Directorial royalty like Martin Scorsese, Michael Mann, William Friedkin, Quentin Tarantino, Walter Hill and the late Sam Peckinpah.",/review/rw2495927/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2011,vostf,2," Overblown simplistic writer's fantasy
","So this was the movie to watch these days. An asocial hero hiding a heart of gold and ultra-violence under apparent dumbness. He is not even slightly interesting, he doesn't talk, he lives in his little inner world of cars and precision mechanics, an economy-class emotional bubble that can burst into something relentless.",/review/rw2495927/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2011,Ziya90,4," Empty, soulless and sadistic with a pseudo-artistic touch!
","I believe that the most important element in a movie first is ""having heart and soul in the delivery"" in other words dramatic structure which leads to impressiveness and effectiveness both. Why the worst film I have ever seen in my life is Federico Fellini's Otto e Mezzo? or Why I hated Darren Aranofsky's The Fountain? Because there were no heart and soul in the delivery and believe me especially critics love that! Cinema without heart. Now, let's talk about Drive. What an original and ""never-seen-before"" story! A hired driver who doesn't talk much decides to protect a family, a girl and her child and things in his job go awry! Other than such clichés in the plot and lacking of heart and soul, there were other flaws in the movie. Being a ""driver"" or being a cool hired killer is not that easy! Ryan Gosling's wooden performance and his senseless character are just pointless and has not any interesting or deep element. The violence in the movie was neither artistic nor entertaining, it was sick and sadistic! Also it was pointless! You know Quentin Tarantino makes extremely violent movies like Kill Bill, but it is entertaining and it is artistic at the same time. Drive is not! What about music? Well, oddly, it reminded me Tron, another movie I didn't like, so simply I wasn't impressed by the songs either. Is Drive an action packed? Not at all! The movie has an exciting opening, but then it turns into an empty and dull pseudo-art work with some disgusting violence. The rest of the movie is not a piece of art or an audiovisual feast in contrast with the hype, that's why I was seriously frustrated by the movie! Unfortunately the flaws hasn't finished yet, Drive has an anti climax and pretentious finale that leaves you totally unsatisfied. I am sorry, but the ones who call this as art owe other art house directors an apology.",/review/rw2495927/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2011,recoltes,," Drive through LA
","A haunting movie with a stilted atmosphere reminiscent of Mulholland Drive though in an altogether different genre. The pink credits beginning the movie and the music throughout are pure eighties and set an offbeat tone against the contemporary LA streets and skyline. Great character studies punctuated by violent action scenes keep the audience immersed in this blood bath of a movie. Some powerful performances, stylish direction and intricate plotting complete this strangely understated production. Drive may not deliver box office gold in the short term though will certainly be paying long term dividends as a reference point for future film noir writers, directors and fans.",/review/rw2495927/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2013,skepticskeptical,3," From nice guy to mass murderer in thirty minutes flat.

29 September 2011,st-shot,5," Boring Drive fails to maintain decent speed.
",This sluggish piece of neo noir featuring a protagonist (Ryan Gosling) in a constant state of comatose cool who assists in LA heists will have you wanting to get out after a couple of miles as it cruises into the slow lane of mawkish pretentiousness after the first twenty minutes. Other than a couple of taut car chases this lemon has to depend on some vivid gratuitous violence to keep the audience awake as it careens out of control.,/review/rw2495927/?ref_=tt_urv
