21 August 2022,imseeg,5," Interesting idea for a story, which never reached it's potential. In other words: boring
","When one places 2 actors in 1 room and there is nothing else but a white room, then THE ACTING becomes paramount.",/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2022,jtindahouse,8," Admittedly it's my kind of movie - but I really enjoyed it
","'The Immaculate Room' is the type of film that makes me worry about which other films I would really enjoy that I haven't watched because of a low IMDb score. 4.3/10 is criminally low for a film like this, in my opinion. Is it just young people upset that nothing has blown up in the first 40 minutes of the film, switching it off and giving it a 1/10? Or are people actually finding this offensively bad and I've just missed something? I'm not entirely sure. All I know is I had a great time with it.",/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,MogwaiMovieReviews,4," Already-Dated Pandemic-Era Product
","It's hard to imagine a more obviously COVID-era movie, made in strict isolation with a small handful of actors, some of whom never even meet each other and talk only to a camera in another room.",/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2022,storey97,3," How do they keep bumping into things
",It drove me crazy that they kept bumping into the bed or kept saying they couldn't see anything after the lights went out even though the room had the entire floor covered with lights. I mean the bed practically had underglow light effects like a car would have.,/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,2," unstimulating, unexciting mess
","This film is just a boring mess. There isn't anything intellectual about it. I personally found it tedious to watch, hoping it had something intelligent to say. But the film is just about greed, insecurities and jealousy. As an audience member, I was just as bored as the actors on the screen.",/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2022,johnnyhbtvs27,4," A Real Letdown From A Good Idea
","The Immaculate Room feels like a missed opportunity. It has an interesting idea and starts off well enough but loses it's way badly towards the end. Emile Hirsch (who is seemingly incapable of a bad performance) and Kate Bosworth (may be the strongest i've seen her) give great performances and it was nice to see M. Emmet Walsh in one scene. The concept of the movie is definitely better than the execution and the directing is rather poor at times, most notably in the ending which is rushed and is really a letdown after what's gone on before. Shame.......................................................",/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2022,demonblade-37792,5," Can You Survive?
","A couple are sent to ""The Immaculate Room"" where if you spend 50 days in a room where there is mostly nothing that you win 5 million dollars. It was quite intriguing that the movie was shot in only one room and Mikey and Kate are questioning their own sanity while spent locked up by themselves as days go on with surprises that the room gives them. It is, at best, a decent film.",/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2022,lynxmajic87,3," Shallow characters, predictable story
","From the first moment the characters are shown, it is clear they have nothing in common and arguments are going to be all over the place. Kate and Michael depict two opposite ways of dealing with the Room. The two main characters seem to live two parallel lives, which never meet. Why did the director write these? Just to show two opposite characters within the Room? Michael and Kate learn nothing from each other. They do not grow or develop.",/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2022,publicemaildump,1," More horsecrap than the whole room could fit!!!
","I could have filmed this piece of junk for $10,000 (stripper included). Absolute waste of time, zero entertainment or thought implied. If you have seen The Cube, nobody could ever beat that.",/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,gab-67599,6," Not Great
","As expected the whole movie was shot in one room. I knew this going into the movie. I pictured it would be like movies such as Cube (1997), or Room (2015). The only difference was those movies added something special into the mix, where this one didn't! I must say I added a star because I am a Hirsch fan, but only one star. The few interesting moments did not outweigh the long drawn out boring parts in this movie.",/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,jarskynz,4," Interest concept, poor execution
","The Immaculate Room, is as the synopsis states...a movie where you spend 50 days in a white room, and by completing this you win $5 million.",/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,gqkmqmtym,1," As soon as I saw Chicken Soup for the Soul...
",I knew it would be bland as soon as I saw which media company was behind this. Chicken Soup for the Soul claims to be the most self-conscious aware organization but they are so bland when it comes to their storytelling I'm talking no seasoning salmonella still pink in the middle because nothing's ever finished the way it should be. It's fully cooked with no spices. It leaves so much room for improvement you could make a whole new dish.,/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,rotini-52586,1," Kinda Dumb
",Tried to reason why this was made.....still don't know why. Acting was okay and the boobs were okay.... But besides that not a very good movie. Watching something else hour on.,/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2022,catfanatic888,8," Intriguing if slow paced movie
","If you don't mind slow paced movies, this might be one to watch. Despite the low reviews, I actually thought it was pretty intriguing. The addition of Ashley Greene took it to another realm which I enjoyed. There were enough scenes to keep me watching throughout. I kept wondering how this was going to end. It was not what I thought which was a nice surprise. Just know that the whole film is in one big white room.",/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,sanrionislove,1," Slow, Pointless and Boring
","The trailer for this movie made it seem like it was going to be a thriller, and yet by the end I felt like I had wasted an hour and a half of my time as the movie and its story was boring and the entire movie was slow and pointless.",/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2022,Neptune165,2," What kate has the worst character development I have ever seen
","Meh these two r dumb but then again the girl was much worse, he remained human and sane and in control except for his trauma but he hurts nobody while she doesn't even call for a doctor moreover she is so dumb to realise if she marries him she too will be rich lol but anyways, if it were my boyfriend, lets say my ex who is from a humble background like me, id immediately call for a doctor even if it costs the whole sum up, knowing he aint rich or even the fact that he may brk up in future (which he did n its past now lol) so yeah, if a life specially of someone u know, let alone someone u love, u give it all away in exchange for the chances that they may survive. The film never really took any risks. The ending of the movie also drove me insane. How could a person finish a movie in such a ""good"" way? I don't think the film truly earned the ""simplistic"" ending. When I saw it, I felt very similar to a Black Mirror episode. The difference between this movie and a Black Mirror type episode is that Black Mirror provided something new. I would expect they have to stay longer instead of only 50 days, 500 days for 5 million would have been more believable in terms of mental breakdowns.",/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,vsnsfmt,1," Don't bother
",Was really expecting this to be something fun it did ok TikTok but I just lost time nothing. Low budget and boring. Nothing is interesting. I wouldn't waste yer time.,/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2023,heykateforever,1," Hour And a Half I Will Never Get Back
","Most reviewers have already talked about the many problems with this so-called movie. I think calling this a thriller is a false statement and needs to be amended to simply Very Bad Drama. If there had been more chemistry between the two main characters, with more moments of intrigue and, well, plot, MAYBE you could call this a drama. But thriller? Not a thriller.",/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2022,sarah-508-649421,6," Not Immaculate
",Not Kate Bosworth's worse work by any means given she's the same in absolutely everything she's in. Quite a predicable film with a lot of conversations and not a lot of 'action' as such.,/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,TheAffableFool,9," Eerie and wonderful
",Although slow paced the movie flew by fast. I found it gripping and well acted. Very tense in parts and surprisingly didn't climax the way I was expecting. Great watch!,/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2022,nathaniel_helke,1," Don't watch - just more Hollywood narcissism with no point
","What a disappointment! No confirmation at the end? What lazy writing. There wasn't even any attempt at some deep sociological revelation. Was this ""room"" a gameshow? Worst game show ever! They never really explained it.",/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2022,alexklaraak,1," Flat and Predictable
",Normally I'm a fan of single room dramas and thrillers but this one was bad. The cast did well but there was zero depth to the characters and the conflicts were predictable and boring.,/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2022,tejasdhanuka,10," Amazing movie n main actor is like me!

29 November 2022,jtcgever,3," Boring
",I don't normally write reviews but this movie was boring... not sure but maybe it was a B movie? I can't believe I watched the whoooole thing. It does have one use of gd which I hate. And there are parts that are not for young eyes. Mostly..just sooo boring. I didn't feel that the characters did what I or anyone else in their position would do so that was frustrating too. It was listed as a thriller but I just didn't find it too thrilling. I just thought maybe I could save you the time. It might be something you could watch while you play cards on your phone or something. Hope you find this helpful!,/review/rw8706940/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2022,Mehki_Girl,5," Not that great, but had a message
