1 September 2022,Tobeshadow,6," Watchable, but could have been far better!
","The protagonists were not particularly likeable and came across incredibly one dimensionally, leaving Hugh Bonneville little to do but chew the scenery. He gives a committed performance, but his character is ultimately lacking the flair or nuance to make it truly great.",/review/rw8501680/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2022,Jac23443,8," Solid Thriller...
","The ratings for this movie are very interesting, I don't understand the review bombing on here declaring the movie unwatchable. This is probably one of Netflix's strongest releases since they declared they would release a new movie each Friday. Every movie Netflix has released in the past year has been absolute garbage. This movie was very well made, the ending could have been a bit better, and I didn't like the killing of certain characters because I thought they were great! But this movie was solid, definitely rewatchable. I loved it!",/review/rw8501680/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2022,BenW1999,7," Not what I expected, but I enjoyed this.
",I did not do any research on this film or read any reviews so I thought this was going to be a political drama. After watching the 1st 15 to 20 minutes I then thought I was correct that there was a political drama but then the story took a turn and then it clearly became more of a thriller/horror.,/review/rw8501680/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2022,Eiriksterminator,8," It is good.
","Hugh Bonneville does such a good job as the menacing villain, and the plot keeps you on your toes. A few people make some bad mistakes, but it's not enough to destroy the anticipation of wanting to see what happens, and most of the time things are believable. Don't know what people are complaining about. I especially have no idea why some people are calling out the ending, I wouldn't have had it end any other way, and this complaint makes no sense to me. Do people want things to end badly or something? I don't get it. :-/ The other actors also do a good job. Soundtrack is good, and the suspense is as well, with some jump scares thrown in. It's not really a mystery, as you quickly get to know what is going on, it's more about waiting to find out how the situation will be resolved. A good thriller.",/review/rw8501680/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2022,kosmasp,8," Secrets within
",The more evil ... I do think we tend to forgive those who do small petty crimes against those who do way worse things. And we have an example here - our main character is not really a good guy in any sense of that word. He is not Robin Hood - but he is doing the things he does to survive ... well a bit more than just to survive I reckon - and no pun intended.,/review/rw8501680/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2022,saysjenn,8," Deserves Better Ratings!
","This movie was fun to watch. I was yelling at the tv the whole time feeling mental! Good acting, I didn't know what was going to happen next which is rare. They took a lot of risks which made the film way better. I just couldn't wait to see what happened next.",/review/rw8501680/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2022,indiana1981,7," Fresh storyline and unpredictable plot - deserves credit

5 September 2022,julieshotmail,9," Exceeded my expectations
","Netflix is the streaming platform known to spit out the most garbage shows merely due to its sheer volume. When I see ""I Came By"" advertised as a dark-looking flick upon login, I think, ""Great, another one."" Then I squint and realize that it's Hugh Bonneville of ""Downton Abbey"" fame looking menacing here. Is he the villain? Could he pull it off? Will he have an American accent? So I decide to hit play and feel instantly relieved that the movie is set in the UK so we do not have to be forced to reconcile Lord Grantham trying to sound American. Instead, we do get Hugh Bonneville portraying another esteemed character of course in his highness. But this time, sinister things abound. The beginning of the plot is somewhat predictable but you stay on because the actors are good and the ambience is dark and mysterious. Another unexpected treat is Kelly Macdonald who is a very underrated actress and offers a passionate performance in every role she has been in. Here, she delivers. Without giving away spoilers, the predictable plot redeems itself towards the middle with a rather unexpected twist, and I feel the movie gets better from there in its second half. Then we get a pretty satisfying ending that wraps things up neatly for us with a bow on top. Thank you, Netflix, for a nice surprise.",/review/rw8501680/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2022,nathanmanson,4," Too many problems
","First of all how bad of a friend was that guy, leaving his boy in the dust like that. I find it hard to wrap my head around the decision to have the only person to get saved the guy who doesn't even have a line in the movie. Yet the mother and son with the most screen time don't make it. Just a weird decision If you ask me. You think you'd have atleast one of them survive.",/review/rw8501680/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,deloudelouvain,8," Suspenseful and entertaining.
","This is exactly what I'm looking for when watching a thriller, some good thrills and suspense. I Came By was much better than I expected it to be, a nice surprise if you ask me. The story is a bit slow paced but it keeps you on your toes all the time. Just don't expect wild action scenes because it's not that kind of movie. Some good tension building keeps the audience entertained and wondering what will happen next. As for the acting it was good and that from the whole cast. I can't really think of anything bad to say about this movie, it's original, well-made and in this genre it's certainly worth a watch.",/review/rw8501680/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2022,nigelmacdonald-97173,2," Don't Bother
","A low budget and no brain Don't Breathe rip off. Yet another film that relies on characters being incredibly stupid to keep the story going. They make such poor decisions that you end up not caring what happens to them. It also drags a lot with pointless filler and there's nothing much to recommend other than to see Bonnevilles creepy performance. Even his character does the most ridiculous things that make very little sense and defy logic. With a little more thought and better writing this could have been a half decent thriller, but if you have no investment in any of the characters it just falls flat.",/review/rw8501680/?ref_=tt_urv

31 August 2022,thepencilhoarder,8," Slow start and anti-climatic ending but somewhere in the middle, this was excellent
","I started watching this in the background. The two graffiti kids are not much to look at and you don't have a reason to care about them... until you do. This thriller was unexpected and while the ending could have been better, it was just right. I hear what other reviewers are saying about cliche themes, but I didn't feel like this tile was pandering to that. Bonneville's performance as the ex-judge living a double life was spot on. The police were once again disappointing but not for lack of trying, the bad guy does bad things well, the entire supporting cast did their job to perfection! Give it a shot.",/review/rw8501680/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2022,levybob,1," Downright Awful
","'I Came By' is awful. I watched it because Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville is one of its stars, and a favorite actress of mine, Kelly MacDonald is in it as well. And so a lesson was learned. Good actors take bad roles in bad movies for - I assume - good money. And God Bless Them. But I didn't get paid one red cent to watch this and, honestly, I feel cheated. If THEY could get paid, so should I. In fact 'We' should be paid; should you decide to watch this film.",/review/rw8501680/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2022,soelir,5," So disappointing
",At first I thought it was quite bad but I persisted. Then I perked up as I thought it had some potential. Then it dragged on for a bit (but I did get a jump scare in). Then it ended.,/review/rw8501680/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2022,lougadou,9," Very solid, don't be fooled by the haters
","I just wanted a good thriller to sink its teeth into me and I got what I wanted. It was captivating, my heart was beating out if my chest. I thought the directing was fresh and the plot was nicely unpredictable; a rarity in the thriller genre. The actors were solid. Jay and Naz were especially beautiful. I'm haunted by the tragedy, won't say more. I'm always baffled when imdb has so many insanely bad reviews for what is obviously a good movie. There might be some cringey cultural references but we're talking 3, maybe 4 eyerolls total. The substance of this film more than makes up for it. Solid thriller. 8.5/10. Some weird smear campaign stuff going on here.",/review/rw8501680/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2022,martinrobertson300482,5," Average
","This Netflix thriller is really being sold to people through Hugh Bonnevilles performance. As he usually doesn't play creepy parts like this, and he does do a half decent job. The movies also kind of interesting. As it doesn't take the route you'd expect, and isn't as predictable as alot of these kind of movies are.",/review/rw8501680/?ref_=tt_urv

4 September 2022,ekwok888-725-796504,1," What a ridiculous mess.....Don't waste your time
","The writers were trying to have some kind of social commentary on the injustices between the rich and the poor. Unfortunately all they have done was to perpetuate this injustice by showing that the rich are smart and competent whereas the poor are bumbling idiots. The 2 protagonists, mother and son, were so infuriatingly stupid. They were not lured or kidnapped into the house, they actually broke into the house which had the element of surprise in their favor. But what were their plans? Have they brought some weapons or at least some tools to achieve their plans? Did they take some photos or evidence of the crimes so they can alert the authorities? No! All they did were flaying around, falling on their faces until they were caught and killed. What's the point of this debacle? Is this supposed to be a comedy? It's a total waste of the actors as there was no credible story, no credible motive and was just a total mess.",/review/rw8501680/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2022,Pairic,8," A Judge To Dread
","I Came By: When a serial killer is a recently retired High Court Judge, Hector Blake (Hugh Bonneville), it's more difficult to get the police to take your suspicions seriously. Especially when he plays squash with the local Police Superintendent. The judges secrets are first discovered by a graffiti artist Toby (George McKay) who raids the homes of the rich and tags them. He finds a dishevelled, starving man but is unable to free him.(Not spoilers, this is revealed in the opening 15 minutes, more is given away in the trailer on this page.) When the police won't act he involves his mother (Kelly Macdonald) and a tagger friend Jay (Percelle Ascott). Bonneville is suitably satanic as a member of the elite who poses as a friend of the underprivileged. His mansions provide battlegrounds as he hunts and is hunted with multiple shifting POVs and protagonists. Some rather disturbing scenes outline his hunting techniques and motivations as well as the disposal of his victims. The director is never afraid to sacrifice a major character as the narrative unfolds and the body count rises. The basic plot isn't particularly original but a nice twist on the trope is delivered here, Great performances all round. Directed and Co-Written by Babak Anvari. On Netflix. 7.5/10.",/review/rw8501680/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2022,arungeorge13,6," Don't Breathe UK: The Rich, Influential Man's Basement [+57%]
","While it'd be easy to tag Babak Anvari's film as the above, it offers some exciting social commentary that makes it a few notches above the average Netflix thriller. The antagonist (played to chilling effect by Hugh Bonneville) is thankfully given enough layers and his dubious intentions carry a sensitive backstory that touches upon the subjects of racism, classism, and elitism. However, it is the random shift in protagonist and timelines that set the film back to a slight extent. From George MacKay to Kelly McDonald to Percelle Ascott, the writing struggles to hold onto its protagonist(s) firmly.",/review/rw8501680/?ref_=tt_urv
