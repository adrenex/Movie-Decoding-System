25 October 2021,Pukeonthestreet,9," Great to have chucky back
","After the star studded but off brand reboot, it's great to have our actual chucky back with the creators and some original cast back too. It's weird how the show goes from cheesy to serious but chucky as an anti hero is a great take. The humor was always the most important part to me and I'm glad it's still intact. Also nick's touch can be seen in it too but not so heavy handedly.",/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv

",Am I the only person who think that doll is acting better and looks more realistic than the rest of the team?,/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2021,beaslad,6," The Lead is Terrible
","So much of this show was good. Especially the final episode. My only issue is the lead character. His entire ""emotional range"" consisted of a scared/disappointed/sad face that literally looks like he just smelled a terrible fart. He literally has one of the most punchable faces I've ever seen.",/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2021,paul_haakonsen,7," The real Chucky is slicing his way back to the screen...
","This 2021 series ""Chucky"" is such a blast. Especially if you enjoyed the original ""Child's Play"" movies.",/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2021,sallianmanyi-44997,10," Very Interesting
","It is starting out great, and is a must-see(may be too early to say it will always be awesome). A decent amount of horror, and hopefully a change for the better.",/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2021,ItzyNixie,3," Acting is the only thing scary
","The series started OK in a mediocre way, a gore teen comedy about a silly doll.",/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2021,AdrienneGrayceMusic,9," Yes
","I based my 9/10 rating on the pilot episode only. There are a lot of jump scares but I actually love those. The show does a great job of keeping you in suspense. It was casted well. The series is better than the last 4 remakes of the chucky movies. Don't get me started on the last chucky movie that didn't even look or sound like him. The series started just in time for halloween so I'm digging those fall halloween vibes. I'm liking where they are taking this series. I was worried when i first heard about a chucky tv series, But now that I have seen the first one, I'm confident that this series will last. The writers, producers, special effects team, and actors are all great. Hopefully the rest of the season Don't let us down.",/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv

","Where do they find the actors? Not even one good one except for the doll. The story is ok and I would have loved the show, but I can't see through the bad acting. It's impossible.",/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2021,Go_For_The_Jugular,1," Just awful
","Question: How do you turn a beloved horror franchise that's haunted people since the 1980s, into a joke of a kid's show, with no real storyline and almost zero horror?",/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,tvcarsd,2," Not enough chucky
",Too much back story about characters you don't care about. Even watching this trash at x2 or x3 speed isn't fast enough to cut through the tripe you must endure just to see your 2 minutes of Chucky per episode. Massive let down.,/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2021,natashialw,10," Loving it already and hooked!
",Couldn't have asked for anything better so far! What a great start to this series and I hope this never ends! I know tons of amazing thrills are in store for us!,/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2021,adotson-98233,8," Funny, stylish, and a great continuation
","""Chucky"" is a very surprisingly enjoyable show. It's got all the things you'd want to see in a Child's Play show. With fun gore, quick pacing, and some surprisingly good messages. This show is heading in the right direction",/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2021,Michael_Arm,5," Lame
",Terrible acting except for Chucky....the actors are awful and way too over the top. The main character looks awkward and is uncomfortable to watch. His scenes and acting are unrealistic.....for a kid who is hiding a killer doll you'd think he'd be a little more discreet when practicing his stabbing methods. He's not the only bad actor as the show is filled with them. The blonde girl is an easy to hate character between her personality and terrible acting i'm not sure which is worse.,/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2021,Jonathanraven1980,1," Garbage. Chucky was more realistic in 1988
","So I tried watching this. I tried... and tried. And tried. This was just... so bad... I couldn't bear it. I loved Child's Play, but this is just pure garbage. No other way to put it. My apologies to the actors/actresses but this is just terrible. Chucky somehow looks even more fake, in 2021 than in 1988... how is that even possible? I won't get into other details because this show already wasted enough of my time. Avoid at all costs.",/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2021,bodhi_74,3," Not impressed.
","The only redeeming feature of this is Brad Dourif returning as the voice of Chucky, although he doesn't feature enough at all. There is too much focus on characters you don't care about, and some questionable acting.",/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2022,pughspencer,9," The Lakeshore Stranglers story is far from over
","Compared to many other horror movie icons Chucky has got it pretty well when it comes to his movies. Sure some moments in them have went a little too far on the absurd side but it only adds to the sick charm of this homicidal dolls story. This TV show furthermore tells us his story is far from over. Season 1 was not only great at introducing new faces but also bringing back familiar ones. Jake, Devon, and Lexy make a good trio you root for all the way thru as chaos unfolds every episode. They all go through brutal losses that brings them down but also tightens their survival instincts to hunt down the killer toy. Chucky himself hasn't changed he's still the relentless maniacal evil spawn in a doll we all recognize him as & Brad Dourif yet again lens his iconic voice. Not to mention his design is the best he's looked in quite awhile. One benefit about it also being a show is we get to see flashbacks on how a young Charles Lee Ray started his thirst for blood. Luckily they don't try to diminish him with some generic sympathetic tragedy that led him to the wrong path. Instead we learn hes always been a soulless monster ruining lives. Everyone else gives excellent performances as well, especially Fiona Dourif who I did not expect to see so much range in. Despite it being a show on cable TV it never holds back on the bloody fatalities and f-bombs we've grown accustomed to in the series. As well as plenty of dark humor throughout and you'll find yourself laughing that how just insane everything gets. Every past Chucky film is referenced one way or another and it feels like a neat celebration of everything that's happened so far in the series. A fantastic season and I'm looking forward to what season 2 brings next.",/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2021,dutch_devastator,3," Ridiculous
","I've managed to watch the first 4 episodes, but that was it. The story is ridiculous, the acting very bad. I wasn't expecting a realistic story, but it was so bad. Don't watch it. It's an insult to the movies.",/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2021,Nightmarelogic,9," Slasher series done right
",One of the hardest tv series to write is actually a horror/slasher series. Writing 2 hours worth of murder and mayhem is easy writing 10 is alot harder and in television there needs to be more of a story involved. So you have to mix and match the two. Child's Play has always been an odd mix of story and mayhem anyway so it was a perfect movie franchise to turn into a tv series.,/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2021,jritty,1," Total garbage - another FF classic
","I feel sad that people today have JUNK like this to watch... I thought we were going to get a nice old school thriller like the original..but this, this is pure crap. Not one likable character - everyone is a horrible person, especially these kids. Nothing to like about this show, just like most of the 'entertainment' we get today. Not one good thing to say about except for the doll effects. Poor Brad Dourif. The man had pure acting talent (see exorcist III) and this is what he has to do for a buck. Child's Play as a franchise was in the toilet with Cult of Chucky but this series is the big flush. Bad acting and writing and directing...it's a laughable mess that can only be watched on fast forward. Sad...",/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2022,heratyplant,1," Bizarrely Bad
","Laughable story & direction, everything that happens makes no sense or is just stupid & you end up thinking 'how did these people get hired' it's embarrassing.",/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2021,blanbrn,9," Chucky is a fine sharp leading and bleeding cut man!
","If you were a fan of the ""Child's Play"" movie franchise then this new extension and carry on of the character and story called ""Chucky"" is a must see TV watch! As the ""Syfy/USA"" series is fun, and sharp with fright blood gore fear in a clever and satiric like way. Set in a nice ideal like town of the well to do suburbs with likeable folks, Jake(Zach Wheeler) who's a bullied gay teen doesn't have much or many friends to help, however when he buys a vintage good guy doll at a yard sale things change a scary bond is formed! As this little toy carries an evil past spirit wise, in which involves an old serial killer, still ""Chucky"" has plans to help out Jake. The game plan involves making trouble and a blood like hell life for those who have picked and bullied Jake in life and at school! It's a mix of characters and modern life involving relationships and really a great origin story. The episode are fun and scary with ""Chucky"" being an evil sadistic friend till the end!",/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2022,shelbylyn-92984,8," Don't listen to the haters
","Great show. Especially if you're a fan of all the past movies. A lot of old faces almost all the major ones and still a ton of new ones as well. It centers on a new group of highschool aged youngsters whose lives are all quickly thrown into disarray due to chunky and the murders that ensue. Keep in mind some of these aged out child actors reprising roles haven't done anything big in a while and don't take the ""bad acting"" reviews on here too seriously. I think it's awesome to see them reprise their roles the show is fun. If you like cult classic campy type of horror stuff I would definitely recommend to give it a watch.",/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2021,rfieldj,1," Pretty Bad
",I don't know how anyone could actually stick with this series. I got through the first episode and it was so boring I kept falling asleep. The Chucky character isn't the worst part. It's the rest that left me yawning. It's another example of why reboots just never work. And Devon Sawa should go into another business.,/review/rw7489194/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2021,SamJamie,8," Fun, funny & entertaining.
","Before Annabelle of the ""Conjuring"" movie series, there was another terrifying doll.
