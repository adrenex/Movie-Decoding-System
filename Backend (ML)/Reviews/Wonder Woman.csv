24 February 2021,Impartial-Reviewer,," A B Level Film With A Blockbuster Graphics Level.
","A film based on the game franchise ""Monster Hunter"", where it tells a story of Lt. Artemis who finds herself along with her soldiers teleported to another world full of Mega sized monsters and her attempt to return to our world.",/review/rw6879491/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2021,ThomDerd,7," Never played the game, but this film is fun!
","Great visuals, fast pace, amazing fight scenes and Mila Jovovich equals fun! No plot or anything like that of course but a great ride overall if you are looking for a monster-munch flick to watch! 7/10.",/review/rw6879491/?ref_=tt_urv

30 August 2021,Gordon-11,," Good visual effects
","The film has good visual effects, but that's about it. The story is non existent, and nothing is explained. It is a brainless monster film that may entertain, but it's ultimately forgettable.",/review/rw6879491/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2020,trinaboice,6," No plot but super cool monsters and tons of action
","IN A NUTSHELL:
This action-adventure movie is based on the video game by Capcom. One of the cast members, T.I., said that it was his youngest son that convinced him to be in the movie because he is such a fan of the Capcom video games. I was curious to hear from real gamers what they thought about the movie and they all agreed the monsters looked awesome. They said the movie is pretty faithful to the original game with some fun fan-service, so that's a good endorsement!",/review/rw6879491/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2021,dacpcon,4," The director of a million scene cuts
","Watching this movie it was obvious from the start its a poor game to movie adaption, but it's at least entertaining, until there is a fighting scene. Within a very few seconds of the first fighting scene I knew this movie had the same director as the last resident evil movie, just because it's so many cuts, there are not even a second long continuous sequence in a fighting scene, annoying as hell to watch and I can't for my life fighter out how anyone can sponsor this director for an action movie, it's always the same...",/review/rw6879491/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2020,DarkVulcan29,8," Stargate meets Pitch Black
","I was expecting this to be a run of the mill awful action film with one note performances, but surprisingly I was entertained, although I'd say not a great film, but in some ways it kind of knows that.",/review/rw6879491/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2021,CountJonnie,3," Rips off too many decent movies
","Paul Anderson has always been polarizing. Yet, he turned me into a fan with Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon and Death Race, because at least he always delivers amazing cinematography, good action and in these cases at least some consistency.",/review/rw6879491/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2020,movieman6-413-929510,4," Paul W.S. Anderson is filming yet another video game series in a bad way.

7 March 2021,SnoopyStyle,6," lower expectations
",Ranger Artemis (Milla Jovovich) leads her soldiers on a mission to find a missing squad. They are hit by a mysterious lightning sandstorm and get transported to another world. It's a world of monsters and monster hunters like a nameless local hunter (Tony Jaa).,/review/rw6879491/?ref_=tt_urv

18 December 2020,abisio,8," Not perfect but really entertaining
","Let's be realistic there are no movies in cinemas. Blockbusters have been delayed for months and the only one out TENET is in my opinion an expensive failure.
Paul W.S. Anderson (the guy behind the Resident Evil movies) decides to release his new video game adaptation on MONSTER HUNTER.
I am not a gaming fan but I really enjoyed the Resident Evil movies; specially the Final Chapter; one of the (or perhaps THE) best in the series.",/review/rw6879491/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2022,kluseba,8," Relentless Action with Fascinating Characters in a Dystopian Universe
",Monster Hunter is an international fantasy film based upon a video game of the same title. I haven't played said video game but watched a few trailers and playthroughs and realized that it might not be my cup of tea. The movie however offers intense entertainment that should appeal to a wide audience.,/review/rw6879491/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2020,DizzeDahmer,8," Give me chocolate
","I'd rather a video game movie blow through the storyline and get to the action instead of trying to explain every detail and every character. Some things only make sense in a video game. This gave me the goods. Intense monster battles, hand to hand combat, explosions and even a cat pirate! Plus Mila Jovovich, Tony Jaa & Ron Pearlman. Give me the sequel!",/review/rw6879491/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2020,Stevensson,," Another Paul Anderson ego trip
","The only redeeming quality are the monsters . Everything else is just so cringe and doesn't fit at all. From Explosions and Loud music to the corny dialogues : ""So what. Are we like Guardians of the Galaxy now?"", ""This is officially above my pay grade"" and not to mention the protagonist used fire against Diablos and Rathalos and survived a plain crash Really ???? that's soo laughably bad .they should have made a story that stays in the MH world. The generic U.S. Army coming from the real world was disreputable . and if you are fan of RE franchise you may enjoy this otherwise don't waste your time.",/review/rw6879491/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2021,tbuestrin,3," Ummm.....
","I should have stopped watching after the opening scene showing Ron Perlman wearing a Barry Gibb wig. I want to unsee that. So this is essentially a combined rip off of Tremors, Pirates of the Caribbean, Reign of Fire, and a sandy Waterworld. It really has nothing new or exciting...just re-used Hollywood themes that are boring and dated. As a fan of Milla Jovovich...this is sadly disappointing.",/review/rw6879491/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2021,andreascaloni,5," Bad movie with some great special effects
","Monster Hunter is mostly a bad movie. It has some awful performances, a bad editing and a weak characterization of the characters. You can watch it for the VFX work. It's not a great film at any point, but there's style and creativity in the last act. And while the best moments of the final battle come perilously close to be very good, with great special effects, the story around is very hollow. Indeed Monster Hunter ends with its heroes rushing ridicolously towards a fight with the biggest, coolest beast we've seen yet. I am disappointed.",/review/rw6879491/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2021,Homer_Ate2,1," Absolutely terrible
",With better casting and a little more attention to detail this could have been good. As it stands this movie is trash. None of the actors fit their role or were even believable in said role.,/review/rw6879491/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2021,ReliableReview,8," Way better than Mortal Kombat
",I don't analyze movies for character development plot faithfulness to source material or any such nonsense. Bottom line is was I entertained and most resoundingly yes. I thought this was better than Mortal Kombat which I feel it's a 6.5 and far better than Wonder Woman 1984 which is more like a 5. Just great monster fight scenes and fun goofy chemistry between the two leads. Love the international cast of actors and the monster CGI was well done. With a movie called Monster Hunter you know what you're getting and it delivers. You don't watch a Monster Hunter movie for plot character development logic or narrative coherence. You watch it for monster hunting action and you get exactly that. Awesome!,/review/rw6879491/?ref_=tt_urv
