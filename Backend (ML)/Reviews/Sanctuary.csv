7 February 2022,mhunts33,7," It's getting old fast
","Season one was interesting for sure with some really creepy characters. However, now we are in season 3 and NOTHING EVER HAPPENS! Every episode is pretty much the same. Now I believe that they have already signed on to do season 4. How is that even possible? This is classic M Night with the story being well shot and nice to look at but the story seriously lacking. He has been chasing the success of the Sixth Sense and looking for that type of payoff ever since. Unless there is a real ""wow"" twist , I expect that those of us who have stuck around this long will be massively disappointed. Wrap it up and get to the point!",/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2021,hisxlnc,1," Going nowhere
","The show started on a good note, there was a lot of intrigue, suspense and drama on offer however Season 2 has just gone off the rails completely. The plot is not really going anywhere and it often borders on utter nonsense.One wonders if the creators have up given up on their show and are just interested in milking Apple as long as they can.",/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2021,windsorenquirer,2," What happened?
","Season 1 was good, interesting, season 2 is so boring and practically unwatchable, it puts me to sleep. Life is too short to wait for weeks for something to... maybe/possibly... happen... or most probably not. Yawns.",/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2020,cherold,8," a creepy mystery that keeps you guessing
","I found the first episode of Servant so fascinating that I insisted my girlfriend watch it while I rewatched it. Directed by M. Night Shyamalan, it's weirdly unsettling: the guy is weirdly hostile, the woman is weirdly nervous and excited, and the girl is weirdly low-key. Shyamalan keeps the camera too close as the premise rolls out.",/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2021,hnt_dnl,5," A one-season wonder
","SERVANT (2019- ) suffers from the same problem as HBO's Westworld in that the first season was obviously meticulously planned and written and then after that the writing reeked of phoniness and pretense. And given that the third season of Westworld was terrible, I expect the same will be true of this show. The showrunners actually said they had 6 seasons planned and given the awfulness of Season 2, it's scary to think how bad 4 more seasons would be. Thankfully, they decided to whittle it down to only 4 total seasons, most probably due to the pandemic. But no matter, I won't be wasting my time anymore on this 1-hit wonder of a series.",/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2021,saadgkhan,7," Servant Season One (Thumps Up) Season Two (Thumps Down)
","Servant is not your typical horror show, there are not many characters or heavy flashbacks. It is primarily shot in one townhouse and that's about it. Season one was great, it was slow but it has all the creepiness what we like and admire in the genre. A creepy baby, a nanny, a house and husband who just lost a baby but have to put all this together. I enjoyed thoroughly till the end as the cinematography was top notch and the cooking and chopping scenes were creepy and exquisite at the same time.",/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2020,cruise01,7," Creepy, unsettling, and difficult to keep your eyes away.
",Servant Season 1 (3.5 out of 5 stars).,/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2020,anthonyjlangford,," Pushes and pushes... however...
","No need to tell you the set-up. You know enough already. It had me in from the first episode. I stuck with it. It maintains its interest rather than build upon it beyond Epidsode 2. It never gets better than that.
It's essentially a play. Almost all of the action takes place in the house. It could quite easily be a play.
Yet the issue is, when you limit something to this degree, the shock, thriller value can only travel so far, until you have to deliver.
It's smart and it traverses these boundaries very well. However it was Episode 6 that finally crossed the line of realism. You can hide reality various film making techniques, which is what has been done here, such as cutting away from certain scenes, distracting the audience when the truth should have been expanded upon and more, but in Ep 6, some events occur that do not generate a normal human reaction. This is not realistic. No spoilers but it took me out of it.",/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2021,frankblack-79961,5," Unique story draws you in. Ridiculous characters ruin show.
","While this is an intriguing story, I just cant get past the characters. Beyond the fact that these people are just totally screwed up and act in ways no sane person would most of the time, the are just flat out unlikable. The situations they get in are followed and exasperated by ridiculous choices. Its really too bad as I really was interested in the underlying plot. Just very poor and unrealistic characters.",/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2020,frankblack-79961,5," Gets you interested but cant keep you.
","This show starts off good. And it has enough mystery to make you want to keep watching. Like another reviewer said, the characters just don't make rational decisions or follow what a normal person would do if this situation really happened. So for me it lost my interest fairly quickly after the first 4 episodes. Just weirdness for weirdness sake. Not very good story telling in my opinion.",/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2021,azarrayyan-29799,7," Servant!
",A huge mess with no answers. It leaves you wondering for hours. Season 1 was way better than season 2 tho. Kind of disappointing. This show had so much potential that now is sadly wasted.,/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2020,nancyldraper,5," Disappointing!
","{Season One Verdict} That was disappointing. We put up with a lot, in hope of a season finale payoff: unlikeable characters, strange camera angles, a preoccupation with culinary gore, all on the promise of unravelling the bizarre mystery. I think it is a crime to renew a series without fulfilling a seasonal arch. It was a waste of effort. No hidden depths here, just false teases. I won't be watching the second season and wish I hadn't watched the first. I give this series a 5 (disappointing) out of 10. {Mystery Thriller}",/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2021,surfisfun,5," over rated , sluggish in a bad way , plot/acting confusing
","Good luck to enjoy this one.
S1 okish.
S2, by 5 th episode, not interesting and too boring/ bad scripts.
The emotions and talks are unreal and hopefully i really quit this badly written and produce series, not entertaining at all and frustrating.
covid saved it with rating.
way over rated.",/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2020,am-by,5," What?????
","Couldn't make any sense of this series. Whats the point of it, if it has no point. Went back and read all imbd reviews with spoilers to see if they revealed a plot. No luck, you could skip episodes or watch it all back to front, it would make no difference. Its a plotless waste of time and talent.",/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2020,Mehki_Girl,9," Rubert Gint is Killing it...
","I actually agree with some of the negative reviews. Yes, this can drag a little, but each episode is a doable short 30 minutes each and it does keep you watching. You can binge watch this whole thing in one sitting on a rainy afternoon during the pandemic. There are worse things that you could be doing.",/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2022,alby_00,7," You may like it at the beginning - but then you get frustrated
",I'm not going long with this review but I want to confirm what others have written. MOST of the episodes end up with suspense and questions that makes you want to watch the next episode.,/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2020,UniqueParticle,10," Superb show to start with on Apple+
","Absolutely intriguing from the start easily one of M. Night Shyamalans best work! Super weird at times, unorthodox, seems supernatural, and thrilling. I love how fancy everything is and how beautiful the cinematography is! I'm happy I got into Servant, I'd recommend it to anyone that likes things bizarre.",/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2019,mtyducs,4," Going nowhere fast
","The show started off really well but now the episodes are getting repetitive. Every episode is thirty minutes of nothing with an odd twist at the very end that in no way, shape or form carries over to the next episode. I am sure this all will come to make sense in the end but it is a long painful process to get there.",/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2020,Erlik_Han,10," Absolute masterpiece, how is the score so low?!
","The show is absolutely brilliant! The acting is amazing, the story that slowly unfolds is fantastic and thrilling from beginning to end. I've just binge watched the first season and I can't wait for the second season.",/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2019,floydbastable,1," Are we watching the same show?
","Had me totally intrigued to start with, but then really turn into something so boring and then something so silly. Yeah uncle wierdo who you have never met ever, stay in my house for the night and sleep in the babys cot. Of course you wouldn't mind that would you.",/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2020,doorsscorpywag,3," WTF?
",Another M. Night Shyamalan con job that promises so much and then goes nowhere.,/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2021,nicoleforster-35742,7," From intriguing, to ""SEEEEANNNNN!""
","The first half of the first season, I was absolutely riveted. It plotted out a great set of mysterious little breadcrumbs, had gorgeous direction, good acting, and a fantastic initial plot set-up. Then... I just finished the last episode of season 2, and feel very unsatisfied, to the point of eye-roll frustration. The amount of repetition, for example in Dorothy wailing ""SEEEEANNNNN!"" from every room of the house every 5 minutes, to the ""OK-we-get-it, you're a bon vivant who's into wine"" references, to the multiple uses of the line ""what have you done!?"", to the creepy characters who come and go, but never get to finish a single sentence without the family shouting adolescent arguments over them, to Dorothy taking it up several notches in wide-eyed crazy to the point of absurd, Sean losing his sense of taste and having a rotting hand not raising an eyebrow with anyone, the attic - window shattered, a burnt out dress, exploded Christmas lights, and 100 straw crosses all over the floor, that nobody seems to notice or bother to ask about. I feel like with this much time invested in the show, I should have a lot more answers by now, and a more interesting way ahead for season 3. It's all very good looking, and mysterious, but I'd rather less window dressing and more plot progression. I do like the initial framework, and feel like we've been given enough clues now to understand what Leanne is and where she came from, and how the baby comes and goes, but it took a looooong time to even get that much established.",/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2021,trcr-59431,3," No adults anywhere?
","I liked the premise of the series - a baby who suddenly reappears without explanation, wondering if something supernatural is going on or just a well-played trick with unclear intentions. Either way, with season 2...all adult logic is thrown out the window. I understand the grief of a dead child and not wanting to put a loved one through the pain to relive it twice...., but come on.... Sean and Julian going along with all the plans that the obviously unstable Dorothy has come up with is unbelievable. Leanne is drugged, kidnapped, imprisoned, violated, almost killed.... And they let it happen, only to not reveal to Dorothy that the child is not even their own? There's not even much thought put into it, aside from a few glances while drinking wine.... it's very lame character development, or at least an explanation why people would act like that....",/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2021,secsubs,5," Started with a bang but going nowhere
","Someone already pointed it out - started really suspenseful and could make you tense and arched like a nervous cat. 2-3 episodes later, they lost the plot. Nothing happened for several episodes, the story didn't move. Great direction and acting but they all carry the carcass of a dead plot. Season 2 is more confusing and castrated. Like so many shows - taking off and weaving a complex web is easy, landing it and untangling the threads is very hard. Unfortunately, this show is just an annoyance now.",/review/rw6615610/?ref_=tt_urv
