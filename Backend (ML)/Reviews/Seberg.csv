29 April 2019,chron,9," Cinematically Beautiful View Into an Ugly Event
","As a piece of cinema, this is truly a sight to behold. The filming is beautiful in its ability to tell the story of a horrific shooting in Montreal in 1989. The black and white filming and the direction remind of the ""Dekalog"" by Krzysztof Kieslowski.",/review/rw3259738/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2021,christopher-underwood,8," quiet, subdued, calm and effective account of a mass slaughter
","There is a beauty that pervades this movie, despite its awful subject matter, and perhaps that and the constantly falling snow, help imbue this with a sadness all the more profound. I was confused as to why there was no resistance or assistance and whether it was a hair colour change at the end that added to my confusion but none of this affected my feeling of reverence towards the film itself or its director. I'm not sure if I had seen this upon release I would have imagined Denis Villeneuve would be equipped to go on to make a successful sequel to Blade Runner a remake Dune or to tackle Cleopatra but the talent is certainly evident, even in this quiet, subdued, calm and effective account of a mass slaughter.",/review/rw3259738/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2009,kosmasp,8," Bang!
","The movie starts off with a bang and if you don't know what this is about (like me when I watched this, I hadn't read anything about it), then you will be awed by this very strong beginning. While it's almost like a documentary, it is very strong and has very good natural performances! ",/review/rw3259738/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2020,gortx,," Tense early Denis Villenueve film
",A tense early Denis Villenueve film based on a mass shooting at Montreal's Ecole Polytechnique in 1989. Villenueve's fictionalized account follows the killer (never named; played by actor Maxim Gaudette) and three students on the day of the massacre. The shooter was an incel-like anti-feminist who specifically targeted the female students.,/review/rw3259738/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2020,gravybacon,8," A Realistic recreation of a real life nightmare.
","This film, shot mostly handheld with a black and white color grade, is a realistic recreation of a real life nightmare scenario that happened not too long ago in modern history. Focusing on a small group of fictional recreations of real life people, this film truly shows the dangers of untreated pyschological disorders, including depression, and the dangers of anti social idealogy in the hands of an armed person. It is a well done film with excellent acting from the cast, and is an anxiety inducing and truly negative experience, but one worth watching, to both remember the horror of the past, and to realize that such events still happen far too frequently in the present.",/review/rw3259738/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2014,SnoopyStyle,6," some compelling scenes
","In December 6, 1989, disgruntled 25-year-old student Marc Lépine shoot 28 people and then killed himself in École Polytechnique in Montreal. He aims his anger at feminists and blames his failures on them. This is a dramatized version of the true events. Maxim Gaudette plays the unnamed killer. Valérie (Karine Vanasse), Stéphanie (Evelyne Brochu) and Jean-François (Sébastien Huberdeau) are fellow mechanical engineering students and friends. The film follows these four characters before, during and after the incident.",/review/rw3259738/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2020,dmdebruyn,9," The Beginnings of a Master
","Since I'm really really looking forward to seeing Dune in the future, I felt like checking out this early film from Denis Villeneuve's filmography. This movie's based on a real-life tragedy that occurred at the Polytechnique Montreal engineering school in 1989, and it dramatizes the event in a way that feels very humanistic. It doesn't make any comments or draw conclusions about the event and still leaves you feeling for most of the people involved. It does a great job of being ambiguous, something Villeneuve has mastered throughout his filmography. My heart goes out to the survivors, and my thanks go out to Villeneuve for being so great at making films like this.",/review/rw3259738/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2011,ronchow,9," An excellent Docu-Drama
","From the opening scene of students busy doing their copying in front of an array of copying machines, and the sudden disruption caused by a burst of gun fire, Polytechnique grabs the viewers by the collar and placed them right in the middle of this horrific event that took place in Montreal in 1989.",/review/rw3259738/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2013,OJT,8," Unconventinal and grim storytelling with lots of film references
","This Canadian movie is really some different approach on a school massacre movie, made by someone who obviously had a lot to say. It's shockingly grim and brutal, yet made with artful eyes and a close look to details, made by a future film genius.",/review/rw3259738/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,lasttimeisaw,7," Cinema Omnivore - Polytechnique (2009) 7.3/10
","""Valérie (Vanasse) is one of the fortunate survivors of the ordeal (does she suffers from the survivor's guilt?), and before that, she has a first taste of working-place sexism when she is interviewed for an internship, and her classmate Jean-François (Huberdeau) is also on the spot, being the stronger sex, he is spared by the killer with other males, but he seems to be the only one who shows some valor when all hell breaks loose. And after the fact, he is tormented by mounting guilt that he hadn't done more to prevent the mass killing (a typical messiah complex), whose ramifications are immeasurably grave, varying from individual to individual.""",/review/rw3259738/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2011,shah_alizeh,," What people don't seem to understand....
",I've read many comments by people stating that this film is bias because it only reflects the point of view of the victims who were mainly female and that is just giving support to the feminist movement but that is not the case.,/review/rw3259738/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2021,TheAnimalMother,7," Early Film From A Budding Master
","An amazing little French Canadian film about the Quebec massacre. Personally I recommend watching everything Denis Villeneuve has made. This guy is among the greatest living directors in the world right now and he is definitely making some of the most interesting films of our time...Incendies, Prisoners, Arrival, etc. This is one of the films Denis made before he became well known. I've seen everything he's made now except for his newest version of Dune, which I'll check out in the theatre when it opens in October. Every single one of his films was well worth the watch! Forget the overhyped Fincher and Nolan of the newer generation of directors, this guy easily wipes the floor with them. In my view, Denis is definitely the most interesting filmmaker alive today that hasn't made anything prior to the mid 1990's. 7/10.",/review/rw3259738/?ref_=tt_urv

20 December 2020,ocosis,7," Heartbreaking.
","It's heartbreaking that this actually happend. The characters, for the film, were fictionalised, but Polytechnique shows a glimpse of what those innocent young people would have gone through. And it's truly saddening.",/review/rw3259738/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2021,jamesives,10," Best director out there
",Denis has got to be my favourite director so while I was waiting to go to the cinema to see dune I decided to search out for this film. This is the true story about a college shooting In 1989. Denis has a way of making you feel for the characters without knowing much about them and knowing what happens to some characters ( the story is told in the eyes of 3 people ) I gotta say it bought tears to my eyes. Such a tragic story told beautifully and obviously my heart goes out to all the victims and their families. Top marks for one of the greatest directors about.,/review/rw3259738/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2010,sddavis63,7," An Interesting Movie That Fails To Add Anything To Our Understanding Of The Event
","One of the darkest and most tragic events in Canadian history was surely the 1989 ""Montreal Massacre"" in which a number of female engineering students in a Montreal college were shot and killed by a misogynistic, feminist-hating gunman. This movie is based on those events, although changing the identities of everyone in the movie to the extent that none of the characters were even named as far as I recall. The movie begins with a long recital of a letter by the gunman expressing his hatred of women, and it closes with a long recital of a letter by one of the victims (who survived) expressing how the shooting had impacted her. Between those closing narrations, the story might best be described as ""minimal."" There's very little dialogue of any kind between any of the characters. The movie focuses more on the reactions of the students as the gunman wanders through the building, shooting any women he encounters. It's shot in black and white, which gives a somewhat ""eerie"" feeling to this, and it is very suspenseful; the viewer certainly feels the sense of helplessness and chaos that must have been felt by the students. This movie is quite reminiscent of the American movie ""Elephant,"" which was based on the Columbine shooting. I preferred ""Elephant"" - I thought it made better use of the school setting than this one did. I can't say that I was really keeping track, but I thought this movie also exaggerated the event a bit. The Montreal Massacre was bad enough as it was; in this far more women seemed to be shot than actually were shot in the event itself - although, as I said, I wasn't really keeping track. The best part of this movie is the suspense that's involved. One doesn't really learn anything about the Montreal Massacre. Marc Lepine (the name of the real shooter) was a misogynistic feminist- hater. We already knew that. So, perhaps one wonders what the purpose of this movie was. The opening captions say it was to honour the women killed, and their names did appear in a scroll at the movie's end, but I confess that I honestly didn't think it succeeded in that goal. It was a dramatic enough portrayal of a school-shooting, but it adds nothing to our understanding of the event. 7/10",/review/rw3259738/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2009,Craig_McPherson,8," A celluloid memorial to the victims, their families, and survivors
","On December 6, 1989, Marc Lepine wrapped his Ruger Mini-14 semi automatic rifle in a plastic garbage bag, filled the pockets of his coat with ammunition, and headed off to class at the Montreal's Ecole Polytechnique, the engineering branch of the University of Montreal. By the time he was through, fourteen women lay dead, and another ten women and four men were in critical condition. Lepine culminated his misogynistic rampage and wretched existence with a bullet to his head, leaving behind a rambling three page letter railing against feminists who had turned society against him and ruined his life and everything good that had been created by man.",/review/rw3259738/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2010,rgcustomer,7," Another missed opportunity
","I was put off by one of the very first things you see in this film, which is a statement in which the filmmakers hope to have their cake and eat it too. They claim it's ""based on a true story"" but they then disrespect the families by saying all characters have been fictionalized. It's the ultimate disrespect to profit (via cash or fame) on the misfortune of others, while not even telling their story. We all know that far fewer people would have chosen to see this movie if it was titled ""Gately College"" or something.",/review/rw3259738/?ref_=tt_urv

19 October 2021,Movi3DO,5," Can't believe this but I was bored
","A reenactment of the real-life tragedy in Canada, and not much more than that. I don't see how this movie served anything for the victims from the event. After a quick search online, I saw that there's a lot of controversy regarding the motive and aftermath. And yeah this movie didn't contribute anything to the conversation.

","Denis Villeneuve's Polytechnique (2009) is as far away from his later Enemy (2013) as I could imagine.

It looks great in black and white, which creates a sombre atmosphere.",/review/rw3259738/?ref_=tt_urv
