23 January 2021,Stanlee107,6," A woman's torn
","This is a powerful, emotional film that captured the joys of home birth & the despairs of tragedy thereafter. The first scene is the most potent scene in the film but given what an emotional rollercoaster that was I had high expectations.",/review/rw6462027/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2021,jboothmillard,7," Pieces of a Woman
","This was one of the contenders of Awards Season I was looking forward to the most, having seen clips and Mark Kermode talking about it on BBC News, The Film Review. Basically, a happy couple in Boston, Martha (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Vanessa Kirby), an executive, and Sean (Shia LaBeouf), a construction worker, are expecting their first child. Martha goes into labour at their home and Sean calls their midwife, Barbara. Another midwife, Eva Woodward (Molly Parker), is sent in Barbara's place, as she is unavailable. Martha struggles with nausea and pain during contractions, but Eva is supportive, and Sean helps to keep her calm. When Martha reaches ten centimetres, Eva realises the baby's heart rate has dropped dangerously low. Sean asks Eva if they are safe to continue and Eva tells Sean to call an ambulance. Martha eventually gives birth to a baby girl who at first seems healthy. But shortly after, Eva notices the baby is turning blue and attempts to revive her as she stops breathing. Unfortunately, the child goes into cardiac arrest and dies before the ambulance arrive. The following month, Martha and Sean meet with a coroner. Sean is eager to find out what went wrong, while Martha is reluctant. They learn the cause of death has not yet been established but are told they were able to determine that the baby was in a low-oxygen environment. Proceedings against Eva have already started. Sean leaves, overcome with emotion, while Martha is almost emotionless and stays to talk to the coroner. She wants to donate the baby's body to science. Martha and Sean's relationship continues to be strained. The relationship between Martha and her mother, Elizabeth (Ellen Burstyn), a wealthy Jewish woman, and Holocaust survivor, also becomes strained. Elizabeth wants to have a burial and funeral for the baby, Both Martha and Sean remain deeply depressed. Sean later starts to have an affair, having sex with Martha's cousin, Suzanne (Sarah Snook). He is a former drug addict, he has been sober for almost seven years, but he starts using cocaine. Suzanne is the attorney prosecuting Eva; she informs Sean that a potential lawsuit against Eva could be very lucrative. A month later, at a tense family gathering at her home, Elizabeth tells Martha that she has to attend Eva's trial and blames Martha for her baby's death because she decided to have a home birth. Elizabeth then tells Sean that she never liked him before offering him a cheque for large sum of money to leave and never return. Martha drops Sean off at Logan International Airport and he leaves for Seattle. Months later, Martha testifies at Eva's trial. She is interrogated by the defence about the dangers and complications of a home birth as opposed to going to hospital, while the prosecution questions if she truly trusted Eva to do her job. After her testimony, the judge allows her to address the court. Martha finally becomes emotional about her baby, she says that no conviction or lawsuit is ever going to take away her pain, and she states Eva is not to blame for the death of her child. A month later, Martha scatters her daughter's ashes into the river from the bridge that Sean helped to build. Years later, a little girl climbs an apple tree, picks an apple, and eats it. This little girl is Martha's daughter, Lucy (Juliette Casagrande), she helps her down and they go inside together. Also starring Iliza Shlesinger as Anita Weiss, Benny Safdie as Chris, Tyrone Benskin as Judge, and Jimmie Fails as Max. Kirby gives a highly convincing performance as the middle-class mother who cannot bring herself to truly acknowledge what has happened, LeBeouf is good as her partner who goes down a dark path, and Burstyn is great as the domineering mother pressuring her daughter to take legal action. The opening twenty-four minutes is a brilliant unedited long take of a realistic labour scene, the story going forward monthly to see the aftermath of the child's death and the relationship breaking down is clever, it really draws you in, a terrific drama. Very good!",/review/rw6462027/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2020,kjproulx,9," Almost Too Brutal at Times, but Very Powerful
","This is a film that will be on my mind for a while. It's hard to enjoy a movie that's incredibly depressing, but Pieces of a Woman is one that I got behind. All I feel like doing is raving about how good this movie truly is, but I need to stress that I probably won't recommend it to most average viewers. Having just premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, Pieces of a Woman took me on a journey that I wasn't prepared for in the slightest. Here are my overall thoughts on this very challenging film.",/review/rw6462027/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2021,Cineanalyst,4," Lament
","""Pieces of a Woman"" seems to be exactly what many others are saying about it: a partly well-acted movie that would've made for a decent 30-minutes short film followed by more than an hour and a half that's not as compelling. I don't have much to add to that because this is generally superficial filmmaking wallowing in grief that inevitably falters into melodramatics, including yelling and speechifying--even a speech in a courtroom that rather ruins what was otherwise a powerful moment involving a photograph of the mother with her newborn. Even the some-20-minutes long take, technically impressive though it is, of the birth scene is more showy than profound. After the title appears 30 minutes in, though, and beyond the credits appearing letter by letter (in pieces, in other words--get it) and sequences divided by gaps in time (more pieces), the picture is exceedingly uncomplicated in construction. It becomes mere dull melancholy. Long with ruminative shots, but nothing intelligent to think about.",/review/rw6462027/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2020,ferguson-6,7," the smell of apples
","Greetings again from the darkness. It happens sometimes, but rarely. A single sequence in a film is so profound or unusual or artistic or affecting, that it alone makes the film worth watching. Such is the case with the labor-birth-midwife scene in this film from real life partners, Hungarian director Kornel Mundruczo and writer Kata Weber. Much of it is an extended single continuous shot, and it occurs within the first half hour.",/review/rw6462027/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2021,ThomasDrufke,8," Gut-Wrenching
","Beginning with a truly remarkable ""one-r"" long take to the powerhouse performances from Vanessa Kirby and Ellen Burstyn throughout, Pieces of a Woman is a tough watch, but a worthwhile one that provides a heartwrenching tale of a woman trying to move on after an unspeakable tragedy.",/review/rw6462027/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2021,Neon_Gold,6," Wonderful Acting
",People are saying that this movie is fantastic for the first half and then kinda looses steam. I kinda of agree but I think that it is much more up and down than that. The opening is really good but is a little manic at time. This bothered me a little bit but then I got the feeling that maybe it was on purpose to sort of drag us into the feelings of the characters at that moment.,/review/rw6462027/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2021,bradh6886,6," Pieces of a Woman review
","Opens on one of the most powerful long takes in recent memory, but not even the masterful performances by Kirby and Burstyn could save the dry 2nd and 3rd acts. Resolution felt incomplete. Kirby elevates an otherwise tough sit.",/review/rw6462027/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2021,sherripadgitt,6," Quite unbelievable as portrayed
","Pet peeves first:
Coming from a nurse, I saw so many things wrong with the opening scenes in this that I just wanted to stop watching, but I continued to see where the story would go. The story lags in the middle, but picks up towards the end. The details lack substance and don't seem to be based in reality.",/review/rw6462027/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2021,kosmasp,9," Sum of her parts
","Long lingering shots ... performances off camera and focus on the titular woman. This really is not an easy drama to watch - a journey of mostly pain and agony. Even if you don't know what the inciting incident is or will be, you can tell ... you can see it coming. It still does not take any of its impact. Nor the performances of everyone involved. This really is quite something.",/review/rw6462027/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2020,Come-and-Review,9," Heart-jerker like a Bergman film
","I've seen several comparisons of Mundrucz√≥'s style to that of Cassavettes, but when the credits arrived, Bergman came to my mind: largely discoursive, disfunctional family relationships, and naturalistic dialogue despite the presence of a structured screenplay.",/review/rw6462027/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2021,Xstal,7," A Woman Fractured, Disintegrated, Through a Story Attenuated...
","The lives of two people decimated with the loss of their newborn baby girl. Grabbing the viewers' attention from the off, as every parent's nightmare is lived out in graphic detail at the close of a thirty minute escalation that lays the foundations for a bridge to the unimaginable, a trajectory paved with chaos, veiled and shrouded in turmoil, suspended on tenterhooks as tense and as taught as Tacoma. With anticipation and expectation set, it's a little disappointing to find this resonance, once established and secured soon decays and rapidly fades, from the deeps to the shallows, as the story begins to mainstream with its contemporaries, as opportunity, empathy and originality are lost and the only structure left standing embodied through the performance of Vanessa Kirby, who will surely go on to much bigger and better crossings.",/review/rw6462027/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2022,becky-92346,8," A beautiful and heartbreaking film.
",Pieces of a Woman (2020) follows a woman who struggles to deal with the aftermath of a traumatic home birth. This film was a really beautiful film with a lot of heart and emotional. Such a brutally realistic portrayal of grief and I'm very happy i watched it.,/review/rw6462027/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2021,laragi,4," Long and drawn out nothingness
",What a complete nothing. No new insight here. This could have been SO MUCH BETTER! I think they tried so hard to not follow formula that it backfired. Snoozed till the end.,/review/rw6462027/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2021,berndgeiling,7," Pieces of a Screenplay
","The screenplay and the resulting formal structure of the movie left me a bit puzzled.
Did they try to parallel the experience of this young woman, surpassing a deep life crisis after a miscarriage, on the formal level and the structure of the movie? The film never recovers from its strong first 30 min, after this you have the feeling it breaks into pieces, like the life of this young woman itself. Sequences seem fractured and shattered, not really motivated or combined in a convincing way. Dialogue and acting often seems loosely improvised and unconnected.
La Beouf's part for example, the most unconvincingly motivated character for me, suddenly loosing any connection, vanishing out of sight. But that's exactly the way the grieving mother must have felt it herself! Maybe they did that intentionally to give us the feeling of loss, pain, anger and emotional estrangement this woman is going through. Strong supporting acts by Ellen Burstyn and Molly Parker. But the movie's core and center is Vanessa Kirby here, giving a breathtaking performance, she carries this film almost alone. In the end it doesn't leave you frustrated, it seems there's enough hope left for a new beginning in life.",/review/rw6462027/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2020,KingOfHungary,6," Good film reaching but failing to be Great
","It's a well acted tragic story that starts off excellently, but falls apart bit by bit the longer it goes until it ends on a whimper, as if the story got tired. Vanessa Kirby is equal parts excellent, and yet underacted in a sort of apathetic manner, where it began to hurt the story itself because her behavior was not shown to have anything underlying it, but her surface level was her entire level. Shia was excellent, as was the Mother. The film is very much in the style of Hungarian films, as the director is, and I say this in the way that this film could and would have been shot as a Hungarian film and played out exactly the same, if it had not been North American. In fact, it feels like an American adaptation of an existing Hungarian film, but this is it. The tone of the film jerks around somewhat, going with hard, every day realism, with odd smatterings of symbolism that just don't mesh well and come up like worn down speed humps on your drive, so instead of you getting seamless symbolism, they are stark and you are slapped aware of them when they show up. The dialogue is very good and realistic, except for a few instances where they get speechy and you start to fall out of the immersion because of it. The cinematography is very great, and the music works well. I think with some tweaks this could have been a great, even excellent movie, but what we got is a hampered result.",/review/rw6462027/?ref_=tt_urv

15 November 2021,david-meldrum,10," Moving, Sensitive And Beautifully Crafted
","Very powerful, but still subtle, drama. The opening birth scene is truly extraordinary, and Vanessa Kirby's performance in that scene - and throughout the film - is a masterclass. It's a brilliant portrait of a woman who for the majority of the film has things happening to her, people doing things they think she needs, agency well-meaningless removed. Her core flinty resolve is hinted at throughout, and when it's finally allowed out it's beautifully expressed in a final few minutes that could feel like lazy grandstanding but is instead delivered with all the restraint needed. An excellent supporting cast too, especially Shia LaBoeuf as her partner. Moving, sensitive and well-crafted.",/review/rw6462027/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2021,tejmummy,10," Extremely well done.
","I lost my child in 2007 just before she was born and I watched this wondering would it be portrayed sympathetically. It was. The birth scene is part of the story but it is the fall out from the loss. The grief is soul destroying and it changes lives. Me and my partner are not the same people we were before our daughter was born. Both leads play this beautifully, the self destruction is honest. I know people struggle with the ending but sometimes life evolves and becomes 'normal' again. We've had 2 Rainbow babies since our loss. The apple theme is true and accurately portrayed.",/review/rw6462027/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2021,amyfleck,3," Blame the midwife
","This movie, while the performances were great was just stupid. And it's annoying this midwife was blamed at all. The prosecuting attorney talked about the public's hatred for her like she was Casey Anthony. Theres no way a case like this would even go to court. Theres absolutely no basis on why the midwife would be prosecuted. She didn't do anything wrong at all. Nothing. I mean the baby even came out alive and crying and as soon as she stopped crying midwife jumped to try to revive her. So I'm a bit confused by it all. Bottom line to all the wanna be progressive (or regressive, dependinghow you look at it) women out there in terms of childbirth, if you want to make sure you have a healthy, living baby in the end, have it in a hospital! Childbirth can be complicated, even dangerous, and women who want to have their babies at home are just asking for problems. 3 stars for performances alone.",/review/rw6462027/?ref_=tt_urv

10 January 2021,lisacarlson,2," Not worth the time
","What a disappointment. While some of the cast is excellent, Kirby and Burstyn, the writing is terrible. Without excellent writing this story drags on into nothing. These actors have nothing to work with. I don't know why LaBeouf keeps getting roles because he can't act his way out of a paper bag. It would have been much better had the wonderful Vanessa Kirby been partnered with someone who can actually match her talent.",/review/rw6462027/?ref_=tt_urv
