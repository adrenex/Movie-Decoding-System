23 August 2004,bob the moo,," Very high hit to miss ratio makes it almost stand out with Airplane and Naked Gun as one of the funniest spoofs around
","Haunted by feelings of guilt over the actions of his father Buzz and having been kicked out of the navy, Topper Harley has withdrawn from the navy to a life of solitude, quiet contemplation and helium. However when Lt Commander Block comes to him with an offer of a second chance, to take part in secret mission Sleepy Weasel, Topper takes it up and signs up for training and briefing with the other pilots. However with a difficult love interest and his old fears resurfacing, can Topper hold it together? Can the mission succeed? Can Admiral Benson get it together? Only time, will tell.",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2021,kosmasp,8," Top Gun Shot(s)
","I should have rewatched Top Gun before seeing this ... I did hold back on that to make it a ""double feature"" when the second Top Gun movie finally gets its theatrical release .. you know when Cinemas reopen and all that. You can still see that it spoofs that Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer (gay?) bromance . Now don't get overexcited or offended - the undertones are there and they get spoofed here. If you are easily offended maybe do not watch this movie. Though you'd be missing out on many good jokes - from one third of the Zaz team ... he knows his stuff for sure! And the cast is amazing too.",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2001,Quinoa1984,8," The funniest film of 1991.
","Jim Abrahams' first solo comedy effort Hot Shots! is a smash comedy that has many, many laughs and is as silly as anything Abrahams has done with his uoltra successful team of ZAZ (Zucker Abrahams and Zucker) which made Airplane, Top Secret, The Naked Gun and The Kentucky Friend Movie.  Hot Shots deserves a place with them.",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2002,Agent10,7," One of the best parodies of all time
","I watched this movie after watching a really poorly made one, so this film came off like Citizen Kane in many respects. After not watching this film for such a long time, I came into this viewing wit ha more trained eye, and to say the least, it was as good then as it is now. This is easily one of those parody movies that will live forever, especially due to all of the great scenes on the aircraft carriers (dogs chasing the plane, the dancing, etc.). While the film did have its dull moments, there were too many funny moments. Charlie Sheen seemed perfect for this role, simply because it looked like he tackled this movie with a serious purpose. Cary Elwes was also good, considering the stuffy Brit took on the whole comedy role quite well. Kudos to all who had a hand in this film.",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2016,Hitchcoc,8," Charlie Sheen Is the Perfect Choice
","I get a kick out of these hit and miss comedy tributes to recent films. The more sight gags and ridiculous comments they can make, the more fun. I think the classic for this will always be the first ""Airplane"" movie. In this one, Charlie Sheen reprises Tom Cruise's character from ""Top Gun."" When the eggs started frying on that girl's body, I nearly fell off my chair. Not to mention that the plot itself and the mission involved are absolutely ridiculous. Except for the fact that they could not be anything else. The inimitable Charlie Sheen with his over-confidence and his somewhat bewildered look is the perfect choice for this. He has that handsomeness that works in this role. If you want to laugh out loud, take a chance.",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2004,TheOtherFool,7," Great spoof
","Really funny movie spoofs Top Gun, Dances With Wolves and others. In the centre is Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen), who is incapable of flying because he thinks his dad is responsible for the death of his co-pilot.",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2004,philip_vanderveken,7," Hot Shots is one of my favourite movies when it comes to comedy.
",Hot Shots is one of my favorite movies when it comes to comedy. It was made in a time that farting and burping weren't yet considered as the very best humor has to offer. ,/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2017,zkonedog,8," The King of Sight Gags
","Here's the basic formula for dissecting this film: If ""Airplane"" spoofed a single film (in this case ""Top Gun"") instead of an entire genre (disaster films), you'd get ""Hot Shots"".",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2006,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," I have to admit, I actually laughed more than few times
","I'm not sure why, but I guess I was interested in seeing the first Hot Shots since my mom only has the sequel and I noticed the movie in Blockbuster, I also love Charlie Sheen in comedies, he works so well in spoofs. Not to mention all in all, I do love spoofs, most work for me. It's just the kind comedy that I like. Hot Shots! proved itself to be a worthy spoof that is more than worth watching. It spoofs Top Gun, An Officer and a Gentleman, 9 1/2 Weeks, Gone with the Wind, Rocky, among many other movies.",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 1998,Peach-2,10," One of the funniest films ever.
",Hot Shots is one of the funniest films I have ever seen in my life. I laughed so much it nearly made me sick to my stomach. There's really no better proof of a great comedy than when you laugh from beginning to end. Lloyd Bridges is hilarious and Charlie Sheen is really great at these type of films. The whole cast is great. Jim Abrahams has made a modern classic in my opinion.,/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2020,planktonrules,8," One of the best of the ""Airplane!"" style films.
","With the success of ""Airplane!"" came many other similar style films. Some were by the same folks who made ""Airplane!"", such as ""Hot Shots!"", and many were by wannabes....who generally came up very short in bringing off such a rapid-fire comedy. While not quite as funny as ""Airplane!"", I think ""Hot Shots!"" is probably about as close as they got to recapturing the style and humor...along with ""Airplane! 2"".",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2014,SnoopyStyle,5," smirk worthy
","It's parody of ""Top Gun"" from Jim Abrahams of ""Airplane!"" and ""Naked Gun"". Lt. Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) is the Maverick character who is struggling with his father's history. Lt. Kent Gregory (Cary Elwes) is the Iceman character. Ramada Thompson (Valeria Golino) is Topper's psychiatrist. Jim 'Wash Out' Pfaffenbach (Jon Cryer) suffers from walleye vision. Pete 'Dead Meat' Thompson (William O'Leary) is ... well ... dead meat. Adm. Thomas Benson (Lloyd Bridges) is their clueless commanding officer. Lt. Cmdr. James Block (Kevin Dunn) is trying to create problems so that they get new planes with help from the manufacturer.",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2006,no-406,10," Memories...
","It's 2006 and I still believe this is one of the best parodies of all times, worth to include next to Spaceballs, Naked Gun and Scary Movie (all 3 of them).",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2021,cricketbat,9," This spoof film flies high above the others
","I know Hot Shots is a dumb movie, but it's the good kind of dumb that makes me laugh. Charlie Sheen is playing his role as Topper Harley so seriously that this could have been a drama, but the jokes are just too quick and too plentiful. This lampoons a number of movies, and features some gags that I laugh at just thinking about them. This spoof film flies high above the others.",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2021,damianphelps,8," Very Very Funny
","There a a stack of these kinds of movies, Airplane, Naked Gun, Top Secret, Hot Shots is up there with the best of them.",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2016,OllieSuave-007,10," First class comedy spoof!
","This is a comedy from Jim Abrahams, spoofing Top Gun in which unstable fighter pilot Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) tries to complete his mission of destroying the Iraqi dictator's nuclear plants.",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2017,Mr-Fusion,7," This flight is loaded down with gags
","I'm not really sure how it is that I'd seen ""Part Deux"" a good five or six times as a teenager but never the first one. The humor in ""Hot Shots"" is as broad as possible, always trafficking in outright silliness. In that regard, not all of the jokes work, but the ones that do are knee-slappers. And Lloyd Bridges is comedy gold, I mean the man doesn't have one line that isn't a scream.",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2006,mattkratz,," reasonably funny
","I think this was a decent send-up of the Top Gun movies and other films as well. (Dances With Wolves, etc.) There are many hilarious scenes, such as Jon Cryer's ""Wall Vision"" and Charlie Sheen's Indian nickname translating as ""Fluffy Bunny Feet."" You know something bad and funny is going to happen when Dead Meat reveals all that he's carrying-right before he goes on a mission. Charlie Sheen gives a truly hilarious performance as Topper-a man on a mission, in more ways than one. The Superman and Dances With Wolves scenes are inspiringly funny, and the movie was overall a good one. I recommend this to anyone who likes comedies and spoofs.",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2006,lee_eisenberg,10," hotter and hotter
","I've never seen ""Top Gun"", but as far as I'm concerned, ""Hot Shots!"" is sufficient! Since this is from the guys who gave us ""Airplane!"", that should tell you everything about it. There is actually a plot: loner Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) goes into the air force, and a series of goofy things ensue. But don't let that fool you. Just sit back and enjoy the gags (the one about the relatives should send you off the walls).",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2021,Christopher_Reid,9," Very stupid and very funny
","Part of why Hot Shots! Works is that the actors are good and take it seriously. Charlie Sheen and Cary Elwes are talented actors who have been in many good and serious films, along with much of the rest of the cast. It's much funnier when ridiculous and immature lines and jokes are delivered seriously, as if the characters are completely oblivious to the jokes. It also means what little of the story there is can at least be appreciated, although it's 99% farce.",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2017,philtbautista,10," Fun to Make - Great Cast and Crew
","After finishing up a gig on the Space Shuttle in Houston, I called Billy (Aerial Unit) and he says ""We can use a guy your size, come on out!"". So I was an extra: A Carrier Deck Hand, Iraqi Soldier, they guy who holds up the weight sign to the pilot, etc. Then one day Matthew the 2nd AD is looking for Charlie to set up a scene and says ""Go tell Wardrobe to put you in Charlie's dress white's and get out here, we gotta set up this scene and Charlie's shooting another scene right now"". So I did, and then became his Stand-In from there.",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2008,Hassard1994,," Very good comedy to pass the time!
","I bought this in Tesco for a tiny sum of £4.00 because i heard that it was really good, it has an 81% ""Fresh"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes and was a box office success, grossing over $180,000,000.There you are kids, a bit of history, tell your friends!",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2004,udeaasykle,6," a crazy crazy comedy
","This is one of the best in its genre, giving you lots of laughs from the beginning till the end. There is both slapstick humor and spoof humor, misunderstanding humor and just hilarious humor. Charlie Sheen as the thrown out, return to save them all pilot Topper Harley. One of Charlie Sheen's best movies, if not the best.",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2005,Captain_Couth,7," Jim Abrahams, solo director.
","Hot Shots! (1991) was another solo effort from Z.A.Z. member Jim Abrahams. In keeping with the tone of his other films, the humor is just like that of Airplane! and Top Secret! This time, Jim Abrahams takes on the Top Gun films and others of it's ilk. Charlie Sheen stars whilst Valeria Golino, Cary Elwes, Jon Cryer and Lloyd Bridges co-star. But like it's brethren the humor is real dated and some of the jokes don't work like they used to. But I wouldn't miss watching it again if it was on the idiot box. I wonder what the film would have been like if the Z.A.Z. team worked on it? Followed by Hot Shots! Part Deux.",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2021,AngelHonesty,7," Funny
","Not bad for a parody. I've seen some really bad ones and yes, this one has its cringe worthy moments too, but it also has some genuinely funny ones. I liked how some of the jokes were simple and subtle. Others were a little over the top, but it still blended together nicely. The overall storyline was really dumb, but when you're mocking a movie such as top gun, I guess you have to go to extremes to do so. I think it all depends on your taste if you'll like it. It's a funny mockery of a great film. Stupid, and yet funny. Well acted and filmed pretty good.",/review/rw6888454/?ref_=tt_urv
