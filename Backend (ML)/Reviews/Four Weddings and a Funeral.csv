","I absolutely LOVE the new adaptation, it's gorgeous, the music is great, the characters are finally true to the original manga (oh my Shigure!!!!!) and it just gives you the feeling that the team working on it are all fans themselves!",/review/rw6790854/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2020,harrythewooldridge,10," I can't express it in words... so
","This series is incredible and if you've seen it you'll probably know what I mean, and if not, I'll put it this way. if I had 3 wishes I would use one to be able to forget what happens in the series so I could watch it again for the first time.",/review/rw6790854/?ref_=tt_urv

29 June 2021,atharvature,9," Three years no disappointments
","Not an average romance anime, very different. I liked the ending, so since yesterday fruit basket is on number one spot let's see how much time it takes for FMAB fans to bring this downðŸ˜”",/review/rw6790854/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2019,elliemae-65279,10," AN ABOLUTE MASTERPIECE
","No one can deny Takaya's original manga series, is absolutely marvelous. A timeless masterpiece, with dark undertones that get progressively darker as the series goes on. This is something that the 2001 anime completely failed to portray in every almost every aspect. 2001 was a bubbly, over the top, tiny portion of the actual story. I noticed someone in the reviews before stated that the 2019 version should have just picked up where 2001 left off. Well, if that person was a true fan then they would know that the 2001 version left out KEY ELEMENTS to the story that are VITAL later on in the series. So in conclusion, JUST NO. A reboot was absolutely necessary if you want the whole TRUE story to be told. And Takaya is doing just that, she is overseeing all of production and 20 episodes in, I AM AMAZED, not only with the animation, but with the subtle updates to this 20 year old story, and not to mention the way that they are switching story arcs around slightly to better express the on screen telling of this story. The music also is a lot better in the reboot- You can actually hear Yuki talking, something that didn't happen often in the 2001 version because the music was not only obnoxious, but way too loud. I am so excited to eagerly keep watching every week as Tohru helps people with her kind heart and words, not only in the series, but in real life too. I have always looked back on this series throughout my life and it has influenced a lot of decisions. I whole-heartedly recommend this to ANYONE, no matter your age or gender.",/review/rw6790854/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2021,natertateer,10," The Perfect Anime
","The perfect anime doesn't exist, until now! Whether you are a beginner or an anime veteran you'll enjoy this show. Fruits Basket has 3 incredible seasons based of the original Fruits Basket manga. A true Adaptation, fit with a high quality studio producing the show, and an outstanding soundtrack perfectly matched with emotional scenes sure to make you laugh and cry. While sometimes comedic this show exposes you time and time again of lives struggles, no matter the age. An all-around 10/10 available in sub and dub both fit with great VA's.

27 April 2019,taraegv,10," True to the Real Story combined with the charm of the 2001 Anime
","I have read the Entirety of the Fruits Basket manga a multitude of times. It is beautiful, dark, captivating. When I watched the 2001 anime I also fell in love with the new, brief, sugarcoated way of telling the story. However I have always desired the original story be told as it is and seen through till the very end. Oh the end.
This 2019 remake is dead on and I couldn't be more excited To see it all unfold onscreen. Finally. The real story. And I love that most of the original voices from the 2001 anime are in it because I was already attached to the sound of those characters. I couldn't be more happy about this revamped Fruits Basket with the original tale. It's one of those things I never thought would happen and yet here it is
Dreams do come true",/review/rw6790854/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2021,jasminn_tan,10," I have so much love for this anime
","Fruits Basket is just.. a masterpiece. It's definitely become one of the most memorable shows I have watched this year. The characters were wonderful, all of them, but especially Tohru who was like a ray of sunshine piercing through thick dark clouds. I'm not ashamed to say that I've grown attached to these characters over the course of 63 episodes and I honestly didn't want to let them go.",/review/rw6790854/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2019,rxnvaz,9," Better than the Original Anime, More True to the Manga
","I read all the Fruits Basket manga as it was coming out years ago, and honestly only watched the original anime because it gave me quick nostalgia of the books but it definitely never really felt like a true animation of the manga. It lacked the depth and thoughtfulness the actual manga exudes in between periods of goofyness and absurdity. I am so glad they have remade the animation of Fruits Basket, I love the music, and it is much more accurate to what I read and fell in love with years ago. Finally an animation that gives the manga justice. I cannot wait to see more.",/review/rw6790854/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2021,bill_allison,9," Begins like a Poignant Comedy then a story of salvation
","This has been rated among the best stories and anime of all time. Powerful story with fine animation and terrific voice acting. Keep a box of tissues near-by. It begins like a high school comedy with wacky characters & funny situations. The heroine, Tohru Honda, is a girl who has survived many hardships, yet remains cheerful and kind. She moves from a tent into a home with the Sohma (alternately Soma) family. The story-line shifts into Therapist Mode, as she listens to people's problems and dispenses simple yet powerful advice. You may find yourself inspired! The Sohma Clan is an elite family, yet tortured. The Sohma begin to seek out Tohru, curious if an outsider can be so helpful. Dark secrets are discovered and serious dangers threaten. Can Tohru save the family from self-destructing? Humor, friendship, love, and life-threatening dangers are all present in this series.",/review/rw6790854/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2019,jameshowlett-27456,9," It's Fluffy but also Good
","I'm not really an avid watcher of anime but i saw the hype the remake got and thought hey I'd give it a try
Oh boy it was so worth it
The protagonist is probably the nicest character you'll ever meet. The way each and every character is fleshed out, the underlying themes and the feels..
It's a pretty good romance story and if you like slice of life you'd love this one",/review/rw6790854/?ref_=tt_urv

13 September 2020,michaelmilesstimson,10," Sweet, sad and uplifting all at the same time.
","I can't compare this to the manga or 2001 series as I haven't seen either. My daughter introduced me to this series, we started at episode 1 and before long I was just as keen as she was to see the next episode. By episode 5 I was tearing up with Tohru as she struggles against genuinely selfless nature to put her own feelings first and Yuki and Kyo escort her back... the rice ball is finally picked to be included in the fruits basket!",/review/rw6790854/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2019,lunalovegood567,10," So true to the manga
","I've only watched the first episode, but not only is the show more beautiful than the original anime, it's so true to the manga that you can follow the what the characters said in the show line for line in the manga. I'm really excited to see this show get the ending it deserved - the first anime was great but it did leave you hanging.",/review/rw6790854/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2020,lisadewaal-98104,10," It's so beautiful
","I watched the 2001 version of Fruits Basket like five years ago, and even though I enjoyed it, it didn't feel entirely right, especially the ending. THIS version, however... It's just beautiful. The animation is fantastic. The characters are all likable in their own way. The story is fantastic.",/review/rw6790854/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2019,mariannequintinio,10," Heartwarming, Nostalgic, Tearful
","Sometimes I wonder why I keep watching this 2009 reboot even though I've already finished the manga 12 years ago (and even though I finished watching the 2001 original series 18 years ago). Despite each episode running fast-paced due to closely following the manga, it is heartwarming, nostalgic, and makes me tear up, especially in the later half of the series. Whether I watch it in Japanese dub (with English subtitles) or English dub, I find myself crying over each emotionally-heavy scene. Here are a few reasons why I'm giving Fruits Basket: 1st Season (2019) a 10/10:",/review/rw6790854/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2021,elwinpjohn,10," A story which makes your lips smile but your heart cry
","I have not watched the 2001 version so I won't be commenting about it, but these 2 seasons made me very emotional, a very unique story idea, the characters of tohru, kyo and yuki and their own personal problems in completely different directions and the help they received from each other is just really beautiful.... TOHRU HONDA is a masterpiece character, the voice actors both sub and dub have really done an amazing job because the voice has a soothing, loving and caring touch..... All I can now say is thank you for making this",/review/rw6790854/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2019,h_hesselbach,9," Love this reboot
","I remember watching Fruit basket (2001), it only aired 26 episode. I'm glad they brought back some of the same voice actor who were in the 2001 version. I really hope that the reboot of Fruit Basket will go more than 26 episodes and trying to stay true to the Manga Series.",/review/rw6790854/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2020,emily-crutcher,10," I rarely give anything 10/10
","This anime/manga has stuck with me since childhood. 20 years later and it's still the most beautiful, insightful adventure. This anime helped me grow and shape myself. And I still take lessons from it today as a parent myself. It's a masterpiece and a must watch, again and again. My only issue is that it's SO good you could get addicted to it!",/review/rw6790854/?ref_=tt_urv

27 April 2019,meloetta-38655,10," I enjoyed fruits basket before and I enjoy it now
","I've read the manga and have seen the older 2001 version of fruits basket. If I'm being honest the 2001 version kind of left me disappointed I felt like they missed a lot from the manga and they didn't portray everything in the best way but don't get me wrong I still LOVE the anime. When I heard fruits basket was getting a reboot I was overjoyed! I have hope that they will stay truer to the plot from the manga and if you look at it this way , maybe it will get another season as well , the 2001 version stopped , where as in the manga their story had just begun you don't see the full depth in kyo and tohru's relationship in the 2001 version as opposed to in the manga. I've been watching all the newest episodes of the 2019 reboot and if I'm being honest I love it ! I admire the newer update in the art , I'm so happy that they used the same voice actors as the original, and I'm also glad that they are making sutle updates which make more sense to the viewer, it's also fun to rewatch . Overall an amazing anime and if you haven't I suggest reading the manga too both are fantastic . This may just be my opinion, that's okay but personally I really love the new reboot .",/review/rw6790854/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2020,brindanasker,10," PHENOMENAL
","Hands down the best anime series I have ever watched. This series made me cry so many times. Fruits Basket deals with some serious mental health topics and traumas even though it has lots of romance and fantasy. I've grown an emotional connection with Fruits Basket after finishing the second season. The first season is lighthearted but the second season gets dark, intense, more romantic and into a total emotional rollercoaster. The animation is mind-blowing and the music tracks and OST are phenomenal as well. There's lots of comedy and adorable moments too. This show has everything. WATCH THIS OR YOU'RE SERIOUSLY MISSING OUT.",/review/rw6790854/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2021,iluvpink-16132,10," My Favorite Adaptation
","The original 2001 adaptation is what got me into anime. But the ending always left me unsatisfied, especially after reading the manga. This by far is the best ""remake"" of an anime I have seen. Fruits Basket finally get to be told in all it's glory. The animation is beautiful, the pacing is a tad rushed but the key parts are all there. It's nice that all the original voice actors are back. The storyline is well done, and it's sticks close to the manga. I recommend this anime for any first time watchers as well. The story is a complex, and not predictable. Many plot twists and shocking Revelations, all the characters are relatable in some way. 10/10.",/review/rw6790854/?ref_=tt_urv
