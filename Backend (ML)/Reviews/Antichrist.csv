14 January 2023,mccabe-shannon,8," Why do people confuse the persons actual personality with that of a traitor?
","So, I've never been a huge fan or watched of the reality competition shows. I've seen maybe a couple episodes of some of them over the last what 25 years. I don't watch much reality tv in general with the exception of below deck (so Kate was the only one I really knew before watching). I decided to give it a shot and watched the entire thing with a few hour break for sleep. Some of the production was a bit much but that's to be expected.",/review/rw8842827/?ref_=tt_urv

","I do have to say I was very skeptical about this show from the beginning , I wasn't sure if I would like it but after the second episode I started to really enjoy it . The characters started to grow on me and kept me captivated and wanting more .",/review/rw8842827/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,tikitim-47092,9," Very addictive...pleasantly surprised
","So I binge watched the entire season in about 3 days. I didn't know if I would like it at first and I really didn't know many of the reality stars except a few from Bravo shows. However, I must say once I started it and got familiar with the rules of the game and how it worked it was very engaging and I could not stop watching. I think I watched four or five episodes in one sitting. I do agree with some of the other viewers that it would have been a little bit more intriguing had the traitors not actually been identified to the audience because it would have kept us guessing more. But on the other hand it was interesting hearing their reasoning and strategic moves for who they would pick off one by one. I definitely would watch another season and I hope it gets picked up. I wasn't bored at all and it was interesting seeing the different personalities and cliques that formed. Definitely worth a watch in my opinion.",/review/rw8842827/?ref_=tt_urv

",I accidentally watched the first episode and it reminded me so much of the board game The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow (it's literally the game in a TV show format) and it gave me such a nostalgic feeling and happy memories of playing with my family I just had to watch it.,/review/rw8842827/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2023,ucc-01735,6," It's ok
","A ""reality show"" where group of 20 work together while 1 or more are traitors. At first we are lead to believe this kind of a who done it type show. But it isn't.",/review/rw8842827/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,entej,3," Very very weak
","Started to watch this after uk and Australian versions. My GOD, this is bad! Challenges are exactly the same as in UK version. I think it has been shot even in a same castle.",/review/rw8842827/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,can-u-not-hun,1," Don't bother
","This is an incredibly subpar version of the UK series (yes I know it is a Dutch concept but this is filmed in the same location as the UK version). Why ruin a great show by adding Z list celebrities? The best thing about the UK one is that it was a group of regular people that had no affiliation with each other and no way of knowing who anyone else is. Here we have a bunch of reality 'stars' who have crossed paths before so they're aware of each others mannerisms and when they're being off, or trying to hide something.",/review/rw8842827/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2023,hoboss2806,5," After having seen AUS and UK version....
",".... I have to admit, that the UK version was the best. The AUS version was new and exciting but fell flat. Therefore I rated it 7/10. It was entertaining and very modern. But it wasn't 10 out of 10. The outcome was disappointing and the characters were not as charming as those of the UK version.",/review/rw8842827/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2023,TheWatcher17,1," As expected, Awful!!!
","Watch the Australian version instead if you can, because that version is brilliant because they have a competent host and cast that are regular people that actually have fun playing the game! As soon as I saw the announcement for this American version, I knew it was going to be bad with them picking D-List reality stars as the contestants instead of regular people. And then when I saw the trailer, we can see they cheaped out and did an exact copy of the UK version (exact same castle, games, and editing). But I still gave it a try just in case. And gosh, that was a complete waste of time. Alan is a really annoying host (even more annoying than Claudia from the UK version), and the drama just feels so fake and doesn't have that same exciting dynamic as it does with real people. Some of you might think, well most Americans haven't seen the Australian or UK versions so it doesn't matter. But it does matter because it shows how low quality our North American entertainment industry has become. I'll be skipping the rest of this show, and continue to watch the next season of the Australian and UK versions.",/review/rw8842827/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2023,artiques-376-570301,3," Would Be Better If . . .
","The Traitors were not identified to the audience. Were we not clued in to the most essential part of the game there would be much more intrigue and excitement for the viewers. This was one of many missteps, and possibly the most significant one.",/review/rw8842827/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2023,madelyn-67461,9," Great game/show - horrible casting!
","I really really like this game/concept but the casting was absolutely atrocious. The faithfuls throughout the game ""completely trusted"" other contestants. Why would you trust anyone? And then at the end Arie basically waived a big red flag alerting the remaining faithfuls to Sirie being a traitor and they still ""completely trusted"" Sirie. They looked soooooo criminally stupid and most of the contestants did the whole time too so I can't just blame those last two. I think most of the contestants were people that believe in participation trophies. I couldn't even tell if they really wanted to win. It would be much more entertaining to have savvy people that understand the game and simple math on the percentage of trainers in the room. I think Sirie, maybe 1-2 more, were the only people who really even understood the game. And Reza leaving at the beginning was a huge loss in the entertainment department. He would have been smart enough to kill it too. Anyways, I will watch again next season and hope for better casting.",/review/rw8842827/?ref_=tt_urv
