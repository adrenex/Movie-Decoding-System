30 July 2018,paulclaassen,7," Thrilling and exciting!
",I've seen this film so many times and it is exciting and entertaining every time. This film works so well thanks to the way the antagonist was set up. You honestly would never have guessed!,/review/rw1391864/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2016,Leofwine_draca,9," A simple thriller with plenty of bite and gusto
","Wes Craven's latest movie after the lacklustre CURSED is a biting thriller that is definitely the director's best since SCREAM – and better than a lot of his films made before SCREAM, too. It follows the recent convention of setting thrillers in just one location – COLLATERAL's taxi cab, PHONE BOOTH's well, phone booth. RED EYE is a film set almost entirely on a plane, but that doesn't mean we're in for some sub-PASSENGER 57 theatrics; instead, this is a surprisingly mature and well-plotted film which makes maximum usage out of its minimal sets and has a snappy script to boot. Craven is happy to leave the bloodshed and supernatural killers behind to make a more realistic kind of film that only descends into cheese in the last twenty minutes or so, when it becomes an amusing, HALLOWEEN-style stalk-and-slash game between heroine and antagonist.",/review/rw1391864/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2006,=G=,6," A little breath of fresh air
","""Red Eye"" is all about Lisa (McAdams) who is simply trying to get home during a bad weather snarl at the airport and finds herself stuck on a red-eye and flying headlong into a suspense drama. A busy, fun little no brainer, ""Red Eye"" begins like a romcom, morphs into a suspense/action flick, and takes you on a simple-minded but entertaining girl power ride as Lisa races with the clock to save the day. Probably worth the price of a DVD rental, ""Red Eye"" will play best with fans of rising star McAdams and those who no brain it to avoid it's many nagging plot holes. Keep expectations real for maximum enjoyment. (B-)",/review/rw1391864/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2007,ma-cortes,7," Suspense and thriller into airplane by the great Wes Craven
","The film talks about two people(Rachel McAdams,Cillian Murphy) who meet one night very late in the airport,catching a Red-eye.The story is the worst plane ride you could ever take.The place on the airplane where everything is compressed but that really contributes to the sense of claustrophobic,creeping terror, it's this struggle ,all contained within the coach section of the plane. This is the story of the worst person you could sit next to on a plane.The excitement is generated out of this compelling conversation between two individuals that start off innocent enough but then suddenly devolves.The psychological mind-play between these two characters and what it is to have to sit in one spot and be terrorized and basically held hostage,she and his father(Brian Cox) without letting anyone else know what's going on.Wes Craven said that he was attracted to this project ,first of all for the remarkably constructed script written by Carl Ellsworth.Thus the characters are complex,when you think you know what's gonna happen something else happens and the fascinating idea is that you never know who who you're going to sit next to on an airplane.The screenwriter does a character piece,and ,in a way ,maybe he creates a hybrid of the independent character film and Hollywood action blockbuster,thus we can have a character-driver piece,but also have suspense,thriller,action elements in it as well.",/review/rw1391864/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2007,lost-in-limbo,6," My job comes first.
","Wes Craven's psychological thriller ""Red Eye"" isn't something we haven't already seen, but the standard format actually generates into a tight, snappy and gripping experience. After breaking away from its vulnerable, claustrophobic intensity. Craven effectively heightens the suspense, for a heart stopping and dazzling last-half potboiler, despite some elaborate and questionable details. This is sure a different mood for Craven, and you probably wouldn't know it was he behind it. Being short and sweet makes the flying time go by in no time. Quantity seems to be replaced with quality, but still this is a streamlined lightweight commercial flight for audiences. The taut premise builds up nicely, because of an always engagingly sharp and sly script. However it does seem to get quite silly, and overstated towards the spontaneous closing. Even the whole set-up is very wishy-washy. One of its driving factors were the profound lead performances. The lovely Rachael McAdams gives a dedicated, headstrong performance. Opposite of her is a sensationally suave, but sinisterly steely Cillian Murphy. The two gelled very well, and their back-and-forth banter was expertly delivered. Veteran actor Brian Cox provides some solidarity, and pleasant support. The cracking music score by Marco Beltrami demonstrates slick panache, and well-timed cues. Craven and his two leads; McAdams and Murphy lift this one up a notch.",/review/rw1391864/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2020,joiningjt,9," Wes craven proves hes no 1 trick pony!! Great thriller!!
","This is a great thriller I'm writing this review in 2020 but watched it multiple times since its 2005 release and it hasn't lost any if its luster. The whole cast is great, excellent story, great directing, it's a winner. It does exactly what its supposed to do...it entertains!!! Thriller in fresh air...love it!!",/review/rw1391864/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2008,mattkratz,9," unbelievable suspense
","If you want suspense in your movies, then this movie is for you. I think it was one of the most suspenseful movies since Speed. Most of the film takes place on an airplane, with most of the rest taking place in a hotel and at a house. You might think this would detract from the story and suspense. Quite the contrary;I think it only adds to it. In the movie, Rachel McAdams, a hotel manager, catches a red eye flight back home, where she meets Cillian Murphy, a charming stranger, in the airport, and they wind up sitting next to each other in the plane. Murphy turns out to be the head of an assassination plot. The intended victim, a government cabinet official, is planning on staying at the manager's hotel, and he extorts her into calling the front desk and changing his room so they can carry out the plot. He has made arrangements to hold her unsuspecting father hostage so she will cooperate. Most of the remainder of the film consists of the two characters trying to outmaneuver each other. The suspense does not let up for a minute, and the supporting cast is great, including Jayma Mays as the frantic front desk employee. There is even a little comic relief with a pair of irate hotel guests. You will like this movie if not love. I guarantee.",/review/rw1391864/?ref_=tt_urv

12 September 2005,gus120970,8," The perfect in-flight movie
","Red Eye is not the kind of movie that's going to win the Palme D'or, but Wes Craven has never been that kind of director, anyway, and his branding is a good indication of what a film-goer can expect.",/review/rw1391864/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2006,lee_eisenberg,7," more than (air)plain
","Knowing that ""Red Eye"" comes from the man who gave us ""The Hills Have Eyes"", ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Scream"", we would probably expect a slasher movie. It turns out that this is nothing of the sort. What we have here is a slick thriller in the vein of another airplane-set movie from last year, ""Flightplan"". And a very clever one at that.",/review/rw1391864/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2013,Hey_Sweden,7," A diverting thriller.
","Veteran filmmaker Wes Craven rebounded from the disappointing ""Cursed"" with another rare excursion outside the horror genre. ""Red Eye"" is a movie that offers quite a bit of fun provided nobody ever takes it that seriously. It gets a lot of juice out of the relationship between its two principals, who both do a wonderful job. The editing and the pacing are first-rate, resulting in a quick movie that clocks in at just over 85 minutes.",/review/rw1391864/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2005,alancroydon,7," Well directed
","I had fun watching Red Eye. It's not a masterpiece, but it's well directed and structured. Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect in the role. Yes, it's the same old story with a different setting but Wes Craven gave it a good pace. At least not another Scream with the usual college killer. It's nice when you can see a clean, coherent thriller even when originality doesn't stand out as its main character. Particularly from a film-maker like Craven that has brought so many innovative ideas to the thriller and horror genre in the past and that now just lends himself to bringing home what could have been a good TV movie had it not been released theatrically. Good job!",/review/rw1391864/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2019,TheMovieDiorama,6," Red Eye takes off with an assured agenda and safely lands to tense thrills.
","Unsurprisingly, one of Craven's lesser known features. Mostly due to its non-horror nature, with a severe lack of masked murderers and nightmarish masters. But that doesn't necessarily mean this thrilling flight should be dismissed, as its simplistic disposable nature provides some quality mid-air entertainment. A hotel manager, travelling on the red-eye flight to Miami, is tangled up in an assassination plot regarding one of her clients.",/review/rw1391864/?ref_=tt_urv

New ""IT"" girl Rachel McAdams (""Wedding Crashers"" and ""The Notebook"") dominates screen time in this nice little classic suspense thriller from famed horror film director Wes Craven (""Scream"" movies and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"").

She is traveling back, weather delays the flight, and she ends up being on a ""red eye"" to arrive in early morning.

","This film starts out very calm and you meet a young pretty gal named Lisa Reisert, (Rachel McAdams) who is a very efficient manger of a hotel and she meets a friendly young man, in an airport and has a drink with him at a bar and they seem to be getting along This young man's name is Jackson Rippner, (Cilliam Murphy) and he also sits next to Lisa on a flight to Miami, Florida. Jackson tells Lisa some very frightening information about her father, Joe Reisert, (Brian Cox) and Jackson threatens Lisa and demands she follow his instructions.

5 August 2005,misterembryo,8," Wes Craven finally gets the red out of his eyes and brings us something not irritating to see
","Scream was Wes Craven's last decent thriller. Since then there has been nothing but an unbearable streak of Hollywood trash barely good enough for a blockbuster night, including the disappointment of the Scream sequels. Perhaps the genius and the craftsmanship devoted to the movie drained all the energy and creativity out of him, so that when it came time for supper, he had nothing to serve us but his own doo doo. Finally, after who knows how many bad movies later, he gives us a delicious, ruthless, gripping, chilling suspense thriller with Red Eye.",/review/rw1391864/?ref_=tt_urv

We have the 'bad guy' who wants to force the 'good guy' (or girls in this case) to do something or face the consequence. The 'good girl' in this movie must use her smarts and skills to defeat the 'bad guy' and save the day and her loved ones. Using charisma, bravery, and even luck to save the day.
