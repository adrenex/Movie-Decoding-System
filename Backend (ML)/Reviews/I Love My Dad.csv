23 August 2014,ElessarAndurilS,9," Covert Affairs grows, and grows on you as it matures & intensifies.
","Covert Affairs is a show that starts interesting and with each season grows in it's entertainment and level engagement as the story line deepen and grow. Half way through season 5 I'm updating this review and my rating as season 4 took to a level few shows achieve with me. I like how they've taken us with a novice CIA agent at the beginning who gets progressively better with each season with her starting as a talented rookie she quickly raises her stock to a driven professional who has gone dark and from not carrying a gun to plugging the bad guys with regularity, and satisfaction (mine). The depth and intensity of the story grows right along with the character such that by the beginning of Season 4 each show is leaving me at the point where I can't stop and need to see the next episode to get more answers. Since I am streaming the show this only presents the problem of burning through the episodes to fast and being left without a favorite show to watch sooner than I would like.

14 July 2010,MonsieurMS,," good atmosphere, ridiculous storyline
","The good news is that this was appealing in terms of actors and characters and relationships. But the storyline and plotting--ridiculous. To some extent it is another example of Hollywood chutzpah--petite agent takes on most dangerous killer in the world. Right. In real life, he just puts a bullet in her head in the restaurant kitchen. And 1st day agent winds up violating rules and going off on her own? And why doesn't she just tell her boss about the clues in the first place? Right--it's Hollywood and every boss is stupid. It's hard to ignore the gaping holes in the pilot episode, but for all that it was still fun.",/review/rw5383150/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2014,atlasmb,8," Worth Watching
","If you like Piper Perabo, you will probably like this show. Her character, Annie, is a CIA agent who hits the ground running right out of training. It helps that she is something of a prodigy--excellent with weapons, amazing at hand-to-hand combat, and a whiz with languages. Though she sometimes has to confront her personal fears, for the most part she is determined to tackle any problem by immersing herself in the heart of the matter.",/review/rw5383150/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2010,bailinelrsh,9," Wow
","When I saw who the producers are, I must admit, I felt some trepidation. The Borne Trilogy was good (no self-respecting film lover could deny it), but hardly TV series material. All my trepidation flew out of the window less than five minutes into the pilot. I'm not an easy judge to please, but I must say, I'm hooked.",/review/rw5383150/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2014,Shopaholic35,8," Love this spy show.
",This show reminds me a little of Alias. If you liked that you probably will like this. Although it is not as heavy as that it still is filled will female kick butt attitude. I love the fact that it feels like a light spy show that is just as fun as it is action-packed. Piper Perabo is fantastic as the lead and makes you want to be part of her spy crew. The storyline could use a little bit of work and maybe a bit more fleshing out but for the moment it is working fine.,/review/rw5383150/?ref_=tt_urv

",Annie Walker (Piper Perabo) starts as a new operative in Domestic Protection Division of the CIA. Auggie Anderson (Christopher Gorham) is a blind tech and operative who befriends Annie. She hides her secret life from her sister Danielle (Anne Dudek) living in her guest house until her secret is later revealed.

6 February 2021,chrisfairhall,8," Suddenly got much better.
","Almost exactly around the middle of season 3, it suddenly gets better and stays that way. Up until then, it is watchable but only if you have nothing better. The writing, the action, the subterfuge, it becomes an eminently bingeable spy thriller.",/review/rw5383150/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2013,sandimcg,8," Thoroughly entertaining spy show with terrific characters!
","This is the first good spy-type series I've seen since 24 (looking forward to its return on FOX)and Alias (such fun with all the disguises, gadgets and mystic aspect). I was SO happy to have recently discovered Covert Affairs! This show is thoroughly entertaining if you enjoyed 24 and/or Alias. And - stop comparing - they're all different. I definitely enjoy the characters in this show. I am now into the 4th season and, even though there are some things that should be made logical with just a few sentences of explanation, and there is the inevitable craziness in all shows - like getting from the U.S. to Europe in just the right location in the middle of nowhere in - seemingly a few hours instead of a day - just in time for someone (like the elusive Ben, Eyal or Teo) to save Annie's life. Of COURSE, we're happy - big phew! And who cares if it's implausible - it's a TV show that needs to keep moving along. Purists will nit pick, but I would say anyone who likes this genre will find it totally intriguing entertaining and compelling. I always look forward to seeing what twist is coming up next. I hope it keeps going for years without the writers getting bored and killing off the best characters and ruining the series.",/review/rw5383150/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2010,DeadnotSleeping,3," Lacking in all areas

13 April 2020,m-47826,6," Struggling through season 5.
","The show was a decent spy series, that reminded me a lot of Alias. Only with lighter storylines and tone. And a modest production cost, that shows a lot. Especially during the early seasons. But things got way too serious, and it turned into a poor man's Homeland. Even Piper Perabo, who used to be the highlight of the show, became pale in comparison to what her character used to be in the early seasons. Seasons that were mostly fillers/cases of the week, but had a certain charm. And the Ben storyline was making everything come together. Season 3 and 4, though heavily serialized, were a pleasant first watch. But hard to sit through, once you know what happens. Season 5, however... Only watching it now, and I understand why USA decided to pull the plug after this one. Everything in it is pointless, adds nothing to the story and drags out a boring conspiracy and useless drama. This and the cringeworthy Annie/Auggie « love story » made the show lose one star in my book. Stick to the first four seasons, and pretend season 5 is the alternative ending.",/review/rw5383150/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2010,joshburk,3," A disappointment
","I am a huge fan of USA's original programming. They have a great working model: a character-focused premise with interesting story lines. Burn Notice, Royal Pains, Psyche, Monk -- all great shows, some of my favorites. Unfortunately, ""Covert Affairs"" fails to live up to its predecessors.",/review/rw5383150/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2010,tile46,7," Like Alias, only less stupid
","This show is turning out to be what I wanted Alias to be. The similarities can't be missed really. Strong female spy with big doe eyes and a b cup, wandering around in skimpy outfits somehow kicking ass in spike heals (this always bothers me so much. I spend so much of female led action shows just staring at the foot where in dismay) but also managing family and home, occasionally crumbling in the arms of a strong scruffy man. But unlike Alias this show avoids some pitfalls. ",/review/rw5383150/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2010,PartialMovieViewer,2," Ah Well
","My God I was at the edge of my seat for the entire program. I am trying to figure out why I did this and then it hit methe show lasted way too long. Covert Affairs is a concoction of mundane plots and overbearing stars who seem to always be so skilled at leading potentially good programs to early demises. Pretty much a menu for most short-lived programs, this mixture requires a main character who is not a only good looking blond, but also a rookie, and of course she knows more than anybody else in the show. Sprinkled around the edges of this romp are politically correct villains and a fare share of professional victims who are just so smart it baffles the mind...and according to this show, the they're in charge of our nation's security. Wowzers...I am sure the worker-bees feel quite secure knowing their bosses handle crisis by preferring to whimper about their own personal perceived shortcomings than cover the backsides of their operatives. This show is just as much a fail as many other new programs are hitting the market these days. It has potential but PC trumps storyline. I doubt it will get itself out of the cute little hole it has thrown itself into. This show is very appealing to many, and I am happy for them. I am not that impressed, but I do wish it luck.",/review/rw5383150/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2011,cune_aleksander,1," a little too unreal
","There are some things that are just not very professional when making this movie. Let's start with the stunts, they look very cheap, some are just awful, especially when driving is concerned and not to mention gun shots that never hits the main characters, come on. And now Annie, who ""speaks"" some languages, she's like a miss know it all, she doesn't look like an agent who can take combat and be all lo-vie-do-vie, her accents when speaking a foreign language are awful, at least they could have prepped her before acting to loose the American accent, it's typical for most Americans that come abroad, but as an agent probably you have to pass all that. One more thing, the movie reflects perfectly the image of the CIA: deceitful, and driven only to killing people.",/review/rw5383150/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2020,kath0544,10," Intense, Heartwarming, Incredible and More! Watch for Piper!
","The first two seasons were filled with exceptional standalone episodes. The chemistry & development of the main characters make you love them & continue watching. The third season proves the show can do long-term storytelling. Seasons four and five get even more intense & heart-pounding. The biggest reason to watch is Piper Perabo. She should've gotten more recognition for not only her amazing acting, but also her incomparable ability to speak many different languages & sound fluently in them all; her pronunciation always precise. She can even sing & put so much emotion when she speaks in a foreign language.",/review/rw5383150/?ref_=tt_urv

4 January 2015,kikkapi20,2," Are CIA agents that incompetent?
","This Henry Wilcox thing has dragged on to the point where I can't even watch the show any longer. We no what is going to happen - Annie is either going to nail Wilcox or the writers are going to drag this out for 3 more seasons. They should drop the ""Covert"" from the title. The writers seem to have lost their way and just dragging out a story line that should've been 4- 6 episodes tops into 20+. It's like watching a 20 hour mini-series - or a soap opera - absolutely ridiculous. It's as if the writing staff just doesn't know how to end this - or they're intentionally dragging it out to string along fans. I was a fan but it's just silly and, in a way, insulting, now. If I want to watch a neverending story I'll put on General Hospital. Covert Affairs has gotten to be one of the worst shows on TV.",/review/rw5383150/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2015,antoniotierno,7," Boosted by Perabo's charm but with good action
","Covert Affairs is fast-paced, funny at times and charming in a way. This drama provides a less cynical view of intelligence work compared to other similar dramas. Though having the habit of blasting maudlin pop ballads to signal Annie's moodier moments it has action scenes — particularly a hotel room barrage of sniper fire in the pilot episode — of first rate. The series is not as taut or intense as ""24"" or the ""Bourne"" trilogy but works on the whole and when the nation seems nostalgic for cold war simplicity, this espionage drama answers the call. Action sequences — gunfire, car chases and hand-to-hand combat — but also emotional turmoils. Acceptable overall.",/review/rw5383150/?ref_=tt_urv

26 August 2014,bjarias,5," ..only one reason it's still around
","A 'covert' agent looking like a medium-sized supermodel, with (of all ludicrous things) a blind guy as her genius CIA sidekick.. it's as far from reality as you can get. And where did they come up with some of the chase-music (at times distracting and downright annoying). And why were they compelled to shorten every scene (even the good ones) to less than 90 seconds, it gets most tedious when streaming episodes. All that being said, it is now into a fifth season (16 episodes.. and with declining viewership, maybe its' final one). MI-5 it ain't.. the sole reason it is still around at all is Piper Perabo. Like her or not she IS the show (garnering it's one award nomination). Coyote Ugly got her recognized.. CA has given her the high visibility most all actors dream about. It will be interesting to see where she goes from here.. and how they decide to finish up this production. The measure of a truly great series is one you cannot stop yourself from streaming episode after episode, and you must watch every minute of each and every one. CA is at times barely tolerable, and definitely does not fit into either of those two categories.",/review/rw5383150/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2010,curiosity_71828,3," ""Alias"" for children

5 January 2020,AngelHonesty,5," Could Have Been Better
","This show started out great. The storyline was intriguing, filled with twist and turns. It was fun watching the everyday life and challenges of a CIA agent. Piper Perabo played her part perfectly, making me fall in lover with the show. But then it went downhill fast. Things became unrealistic, Anne suddenly could handle anything emotionally making her into this shallow character that started to annoy you.",/review/rw5383150/?ref_=tt_urv
