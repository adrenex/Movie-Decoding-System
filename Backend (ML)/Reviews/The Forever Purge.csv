3 April 2021,ThomDerd,7," Great action, cool visuals and that's about it.
","I am glad I watched this film for 3 reasons: 1-good runtime of 1h 50m, 2-never gets boring, 3-relentless impressive action sequences. Don't expect much from the plot but prepare yourselves for some epic monster fight scenes and some great ideas on visuals. If you have seen the previous kong and godzilla films then you will like this a tad more. But if you haven't, it doesn't matter; it will keep you invested throughout. Its at least a 7 because they kept it relevant to what it is. Its just a fun movie 7/10.",/review/rw6799667/?ref_=tt_urv

","Godzilla vs. Kong
First, this is really a terrible movie. Two Hundred Million for this trash? Are you kidding me? This explains why WB is having such a hard time creating a stable DC universe. Green lighting silly ideas like this. There's a vehicle in this nonsense called a HEAV, and that's what I wanted to do watching this. At 87 minutes, it feels much longer. The only positive thing I can say is that the effects were excellent. But even there I saw problems. So, let's break it down shall we?",/review/rw6799667/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2021,nogodnomasters,4," Kong bows to no one.
","They took the Kong from Skull Island, an excellent film plus the recent less than excellent Godzilla film and smashed them together into a confused mess. They simply tried to do too much. They take the basic titan fight and added ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"", ""Upside Down"" Kong as Indian Jones, ""Transformers"", a light saber Ax, teens save the world, and a little girl saves the world. The company Apex are the bad guys who are trying to do something good. Good visuals. Just a messed up plot.",/review/rw6799667/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2021,kenzibit,7," Epic battles with an uninspired plot.
","Rating basically for the epic battles in this movie, great special effects that blend perfectly with the environment accompanied by immersive sounds to rumble your speakers. Kudos to all those responsible for that. On the other hand, this movie does a poor job of character personalization and story plot. Had a lot of fake smiles and poor dialogues, did a poor job of making you feel for any character's situation and wanting more from them, it's like the movie pauses when scenes switch from the Kaijus to humans. Characters were introduced for no particular purpose or reason. Story was dull and uninspiring. Wouldn't recommend this movie for the plot or character performances but will recommend it for the epic Kaiju battles and CGI.",/review/rw6799667/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2021,alfredsmith,5," Great CGI can't compensate for awful story.
","This is a mindless, plotless action flick with great action and effects but not much else. The plot is mundane, ridiculous and predictable. Much of it didn't even make any sense, because nothing is adequately explained. The acting is mostly awful. The editing made it difficult to follow what little plot there was. Actually the whole series of movies in this rebirth have all been really bad and this just continues that tradition. I am at a complete loss to explain the high ratings some people have given it and cannot recommend it all. Seriously don't bother with this.",/review/rw6799667/?ref_=tt_urv

25 March 2021,MrDHWong,7," Delivers exactly what it says on the poster - a pair of iconic monsters duking it out in the most epic way possible ...and very little else
","""Godzilla vs. Kong"" is the fourth film in Legendary Pictures' ""MonsterVerse"" and the fourth Godzilla film produced in the west. Starring Millie Bobby Brown, Julian Dennison, and Alexander Skarsgård, it delivers exactly what it says on the poster - a pair of iconic monsters duking it out in the most epic way possible ...and very little else.",/review/rw6799667/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2021,Mike_Devine,4," Overhyping and underdelivering is a dangerous combo
","The latest entry in the Monsterverse was built up to be a truly unforgettable battle of two cultural icons - Godzilla and King Kong. Unfortunately, 2021's 'Godzilla vs. Kong' is a colossal letdown - another casualty of overhyping and underdelivering.",/review/rw6799667/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm the exact demographic for these types of movies. I love watching giant monsters fight each other. And i don't mind stupid mindless action flicks. But man.

",It's quite amazing how a film as simple as two monsters battling could be screwed up into such an epic mess.,/review/rw6799667/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2022,veritybingo,2," An overblown expensive mess.
","Let's see...
Unexplained non-back-stories, unearned emotion, characters you don't know but are instantly expected to relate to (like turning up at a stranger's family Christmas), trillion dollar effects with no semblance of realism whatsoever, dumbass ""jokes"" ...
These days it seems the film industry seems happy churning out kitchen sink formulaic zero quality nonsense which is tantamount to the distraction a kitten finds with a laser pointer or ball of string. This does not fit the cleverness, inventiveness or effectiveness of director Adam Wingard's ""You're Next"", which is one of the best horror movies of the last decade or so.",/review/rw6799667/?ref_=tt_urv

","Kong is being kept under-the-dome living on Skull Island and he's not happy about it. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) is trying to keep him safe and away from Godzilla. Her adopted deaf daughter Jia communicates with him. Meanwhile, conspiracy blogger Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry) is investigating and working at Apex Cybernetics. Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown) is a fan and she tracks him down with Josh. Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsgård) is a Hollow Earth expert. Oh yeah! There is the Hollow Earth, a magical axe, and a surprise villain.",/review/rw6799667/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2021,ratpackaustin,7," Nobody wanted a plot
",I guarantee 99% of viewers just wanted to see two titans go at it. Nobody cared about the humans in this movie. So why does WB keep trying to force humans down our throat in these movies? In an hour and 50 ish minutes were forced to watch people for 80 of those minutes. There's way too much time trying to make a plot here that I don't want to see.,/review/rw6799667/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2021,jp_91,2," A waste of time!
","""Godzilla vs. Kong"" is a weak film with a bad script. Two of the most important monsters in the film history together in a movie, some good things and a lot of problems. The good things are the beautiful visuals, correct performances, an amazing music score, tribute scenes to the original ""King Kong"" film and to the ""Gojira"" franchise, and the best point is that this film is saving movie theaters around the world from bankruptcy after the current COVID-19 pandemic but it is not enough. The bad points are the fake special effects and an awful scrift full of inconsistencies and stupid jokes, it is like an episode of ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" mixed with a telenovela episode and an episode of ""Thundercats"", this may be interesting but in this production is a failure. A really bad film!",/review/rw6799667/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2021,cejhinton,2," Not good
",I feel like they pump in millions of dollars into movies like this and of course get great effects but trash story could barely sit through it all. Complete drag and would never watch again. Overhyped and to much unnecessary things going on. Definitely just a cash grab and movie for the sheeple. Maybe would be actually worth the watch in 3D.,/review/rw6799667/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2021,Educhico,2," -
","This would be the right recommendation to return to cinemas, taking advantage of the titular conflict's scale that, otherwise, wouldn't be so well experienced. And yet, I prefer to resist recommending in any way this film, since the public's appreciation is dependent on their acceptance of the rest of the wanderings through idiotic situations and characters.",/review/rw6799667/?ref_=tt_urv

10 April 2021,dasa108,1," Giant crap
","This is the clearest evidence of how Hollywood can destroy great movie icons. Unable to make a decent film about Godzilla, they decided to destroy the two great cinema monsters with the bonus that Mechagodzilla's fantastic robot is reduced to a cockscrew. If I pay a ticket to see the film I want the story to be honored: Godzilla has features that we hope to see film after film. I don't ask for much. But the untalented people who made the film came up with the idea that it was better not to play Godzilla's music. I thought of Star Wars without it´s iconic music. It's the same. An aberration. On the other hand, the humanization of King Kong is unbearable. Uncomfortable, worried, it makes it nauseating to see the great King Kong turned smart gorilla who can communicate with his little friend. Since when did King Kong stop liking blondes? The humans who star in the plot are also unbearable. The boy, the particular reason I hated Deadpool 2 now achieved the impossible: that he hated American movies about monsters with an inclusive cast. Of the others only one sentence: I wanted them all dead in the first frame. Everyone, their parents and their grandparents. I wanted everything to explode in the film, and in the final fight they would wipe out humanity, starting especially with those involved with the production of this slug, this crap, this cinematographic insult. Finally: Godzilla has no neck and has a microcephalic head. I don't know who came up with it that this is how the king of monsters should look. Godzilla for that anatomy couldn't even look to the side without having to rotate the body. King Kong using weapons is as if it were an extension of past films with apes conquering the world inaugurated by Charlton Heston. No Hollywood, don't do it anymore. Stop doing garbage. Stop insulting our intelligence and pockets. Stay away from this movie at all costs, well-shot fights aren't worth everything behind and around them. If you want to watch a decent movie, just watch the ones made in Japan or Pacific Rim.",/review/rw6799667/?ref_=tt_urv
