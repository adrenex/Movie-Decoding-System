23 March 2013,rubenm,5," Looks like an extended music video
","This is a strange film. On the one hand, it looks likes an extended music video, filled with mindless scenes of teenagers having one big party. On the other hand, there's clearly more to it. Some characters are so one-dimensional and cartoon-like, that the whole film becomes a sort of mockery of the modern teenage culture. This ambiguity is very clever, because the film appeals to a teenage audience as well as to the art-house audience Harmony Korine is usually associated with. ",/review/rw2773240/?ref_=tt_urv

","Faith, played by Selema Gomez, and her three very close friends plan to escape their boring college dorm lives to attend a massive Spring Break party. In order to pay for their getaway, her three friends commit an unthinkable act of terror. Their Spring Break vacation turns out to be a non-stop party of drunken drug use and sexual perversion that lands them in prison.

24 July 2013,kathleen-t-mueller,7," an honest and unsuspecting message for our generation
","Spring Breakers highlights the mindless popular culture that surrounds youth of this generation. The reason for its controversy stems from the fact that its target audience found its plot to be pointless, even though that was the point. This film depicts the shallowness of the modern definition of what is 'cool', like idolizing people that suck, those that contribute nothing to society but cheap entertainment. This sort of fascination blindly controls youth, the main reason so many did not understand the meaning behind this movie: they are blind to its influences. They think week long drinking binges, whoring themselves out, and having no goals is cool, because YOLO. However, this film is based off of these components and its audience deems the plot as pointless. Funny. Spring Breakers is like this generation looking itself directly in the mirror.

22 August 2013,Sergeant_Tibbs,5," An unpleasant nightmare.
","Harmony Korine is a strange one. I've seen 3 of his other films, Gummo, Mister Lonely and Julien Donkey Boy and I thought they were decent to good. I can often see what he's trying to do but its lack of character and substance hurts it. Spring Breakers is perhaps his most mainstream effort given the concept, stars and the slick production but it's probably his least interesting. With MTV style cinematography and editing, a dubstep soundtrack and drama distant from the camera, the result is an unpleasant nightmare. I'm not sure who this film is aiming at, the type of person the film is about or the art-house crowd where the the techs are the furthest to their taste? It wants to be a comment on contemporary party culture but its unrealistic characters make it unbearably tedious. Every time a character starts to becomes sympathetic, they leave the film, and far too easily at that. Why are we even trapped in this nightmare if the characters are deliberately raising the stakes? It's a film that relishes on forced juxtapositions such as singing Britney Spears over robberies and it ends up obvious or pointless, nulling its effect. I still don't really know what to make to Spring Breakers but it definitely isn't my thing.",/review/rw2773240/?ref_=tt_urv

13 September 2013,brando647,7," A Surreal Mind-Trip into the Seedier Side of Spring Break
","Can someone explain to me why SPRING BREAKERS was in the comedy section of my local department store? I can only imagine how many people saw this movie sitting on the shelf with it's cover portraying Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, Rachel Korine, and James Franco in beach-mode and thought, ""Well this movie looks like a fun time! It's like THE HANGOVER for the Disney crowd!"" I am, of course, assuming that the majority of people buying movies from my local department stores are fools who aren't familiar with movie ratings or aware of movie reviews. And I'm pretty sure I'm right. Anyway, SPRING BREAKERS is not a comedy and, if it is, I missed something somewhere. This movie is a 90 minute hallucination and a rough one. It centers on four longtime friends: Candy (Hudgens), Brit (Benson), Cotty (Korine), and Faith (Gomez). Spring Break has arrived and their too poor to leave campus when everyone heads down south to the beaches of Florida for a week of insane debauchery. We receive our first hint that these girls aren't quite right when Candy, Brit, and Cotty decide to rob an all-night chicken shack for their Spring Break funds. From there, it's beaches, booze, and bongs as the girls party it up until their arrested in a narcotics bust when they're in the wrong place at the wrong time. Enter AlienÂ…a wannabe gangster who makes his living dealing drugs and robbing spring-breakers. He bails out the girls and enlists them to join him in business, and it all goes nuts from there.",/review/rw2773240/?ref_=tt_urv

10 July 2013,smellyville90,8," Are you not entertained?
","I have to say, that watching this movie was a total spur of the moment decision on my part and I walked into this completely unaware of what I was getting into. While watching it, I felt my senses were assaulted, but there was more to it than what I was able to discern viscerally. Therein lies the greatness of this movie. It makes you think about what images are being thrown at you and why. The image is obviously that of what the youth of our age are sold as 'the good life': money, drugs, sex and partying. This is the American Dream. This movie follows 4 girls who do despicable acts, who behave with such depravity and who are shallow to the core, that watching this can be painful at times. But that is the whole point and people who walk out of this feeling as though they have had their time robbed of them or are too disgusted by what they see are missing the point. I am not an elitist movie critic in no sense of the word either, but I know a shock movie when I see one.",/review/rw2773240/?ref_=tt_urv

23 March 2013,StevePulaski,9," A sad, sad portrait of societal degradation
","Not since Ron Fricke's Samsara have I experienced such an enormous sensory and auditory overload. Harmony Korine's Spring Breakers annihilates both senses with absolute impunity, truly making this one of the most engrossing and consuming pictures so far this year. It possesses a style and a message that is so bluntly honest and terrifically captured that it deeply pains me that the audience that needs to see this the most likely will not, due to its eclectic nature and limited release.",/review/rw2773240/?ref_=tt_urv

27 March 2014,ironhorse_iv,4," Spring Breakers is an awful art-house movie that has girls gone wild! Yet, it's disturbing interesting.
","Honestly, if this is this generation coming to age's film; I have little to no hope for humanity. This movie was pretty bad. Directed and written by Harmony Korine, the film highlights the mindless U.S popular cultural event known as 'Spring Break'. Spring Break serves as a break from the social norms, where youth can relax from the stresses of life. Over the years, Spring Breaks celebrating in Florida with each generation has got more extreme and stupid. I don't have a problem with Spring Break, as it's does boost the local economy, but I do see this sort of party fascination is blindly controlling youth in the worth direction. Colleges are become less and less about teachings of proper education, and more and more about majority in being a drunken fool, lately. I hate dumb young people. The film depicts the shallowness of one such event, and the extreme examples of letting loose of society control. It's pretty sad to see four gifted smart college students allowing themselves to do dumb things that seems 'cool' because of these YOLO phenomenon. Ideas like long drinking binges, whoring themselves out, and lots of drug use. These bad behaviors are cause by two factors: A fear of not being good enough (the fear of failure) & the fear that his or her life's not going to be good enough (the fear of loss). Sadly, this movie doesn't explain it well. There is little to no amount of intellectually subtle social commentary in this movie. It's not even that thought-provoking. It gives no insight, message, or underlying theme. I found this to be the most depressing part of the film. We never truly know why this girls do the most despicable acts and behave with such depravity. If the movie had more inside of the character's home or school life, maybe we can understand what they're going through, but no. This movie doesn't know if glorifying the demoralizing activities portrayed, if it is a satire it, or its just mindless shock value. It's in no way, a comedy as the majority of the sexual, and violence content is actually presented in a dramatic or uncomfortable fashion. Very rarely is it meant to be comedic or taken lightly. I just have to say, it was painful to watch. No amount of eye candy, and nudity shots can make this movie any better. Most of the Controversial of this film comes with the fact that the four college student turn robbers are mostly ex-Disney TV teen idols. Seeing Selema Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine in this film is a bit disappointing, as they all could had pick better adult themes roles. I'm not talking about roles that degraded women to being near dumb sex objects like this movie does. They really need to follow the Emmas (Emma Stone, Emma Watson, and Emma Roberts, who majority in my opinion, start in pretty good movies). Emma Roberts was supposed to start in this film, but dropped out in early 2012, reportedly after hearing she would need to gain body fat for her role. Good for her. There is little to no character development, but glad the movie shows that at less two of girls came back to their senses, as less I think. So I guess, that counts. If there is a protagonist in this movie, it would be the development of Faith (Selema Gomez). I doubt this movie will hurt Selema Gomez's movie career. James Franco as the weapon-dealing, wannabe rapper Alien is pretty bad in my opinion. I know a lot of people like his performance, but I found it to be annoying as hell with his looping voice of Spring Break is forever. At less, it wasn't real rapper Riff Raff playing Alien. That would be worst off. I give some credit to the movie as some scenes are pretty beautiful shot. I like how it was shot like a weird dream, with its poignant use of slow motion, and its use of bright beautiful colors. It was well-shot kinda, with a few scenes that are going a bit too soft-porn. There's a beautifully crafted scene during their robbery of a restaurant that features one of the girls rolling the car around the building, catching glimpses of what they were doing inside. There is something disturbing about having seeing two maniac women kill people, and be OK watching My Little Pony: Friendship is magic. There is a pretty good scene where Alien is with the girls around a piano singing, 'Everytime' by Britney Spears. The electronic techno dubstep music by Skrillex is pretty catchy. The movie is pretty smart with its foreshadowing. It does it with sounds. The movie is broken into roughly four segments, and the transition between each is a specific event that has a distinctive sound. The sound is worked into the edits and shot changes in the scenes leading up to their events. Specifically, sounds of crashing and hammering leads up to the fast food robbery, sounds of the jail cell door leads up to the arrest, and sounds of gun fire leads up to one of the characters being shot. The bloody ending is a bit a stretch of being unrealistic with season gangsters that can't shot at a target that is wearing bright colors; while a bunch of teenagers with no marksmanship skills are able to kill people. I do feel disturb seeing a bunch of white girls killing a bunch of black people shortly after the Trayvon Martin killings in 2012 in Sunrise, FL. I doubt the producers care. About the people saying its feminist. I really doubt that, too. Killing men isn't feminist. It's more sexism than ever. Overall: I have to say, Spring Breakers isn't the worst movie ever, but it's no way, good.",/review/rw2773240/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2013,grounden1985,10," A sometimes thrilling, very hypnotic, poignant piece of filmmaking.
","I can't describe the elation I felt leaving Spring Breakers--truly one of the best films to hit mainstream cinemas in a long time. It was a breath of fresh air amidst all the cookie cutter romantic comedies, dramas, action films, and horror movies that plague modern cinema. The stamp of a good film is the impact factor--how long it stays with you when it's over. Spring Breakers was a film that stayed with me long after leaving the theater. It didn't evaporate from my mind as soon as I hit the parking lot. This film affects you and leaves you in a mood long after the credits appear.",/review/rw2773240/?ref_=tt_urv

","SPRING BREAKERS is a wannabe exploitation flick that warns of the dangers of drugs and free sex, but turns out to be an extremely trashy and poorly-made movie in the process.

2 September 2013,jhmb2003,8," There is no paradise in Earth. Paradise is just another form of hell.
","Understandably, the film wakes much rejection. A quick view or not reflective enough can mislead us to believe that it is superficial. On the contrary, Harmony Korine's film is a bitter satire (at times cynical) about the American youth culture and, in large part, global. The shallowness of the characters is deliberate. The three crazy travelers do evil in pure boredom, the banality of evil is presented here in an ironic contrast to the free and unlimited sexuality and drug use, the Holy Grial of these girls. At times, the three chicks seem the witches of Macbeth, messengers of death and emptiness. Harmony Korine is a moralist, his film denounces the horror that lurks behind the glamour of drugs and free love. But Korine delivers his message with a style that copies and reproduces the mechanisms of fashion, so that a teenager is attracted yet shocked by what you see on the screen. Watching this movie, it is impossible not to remember Less Than Zero, the novel that enabled Bret Easton Ellis earn his place under the California sun. The state of affairs is certainly catastrophic for Korine: a. The pursuit of happiness is reduced to get lost in a perpetual orgy. b. The perpetual orgy is slightly threatened only by religious zealots as the only challenging force. c. No more parents and adults, no more institutions concerned with the physical and mental health of its citizens. d. Youngsters' paradise is depicted as one of the many faces of hell.",/review/rw2773240/?ref_=tt_urv

3 September 2013,Extraneus92,8," This is an important film
","This film largely gets a bad press. It is criticised heavily and pushed to the sidelines, but when I watched it I wondered why. I loved it. I mean I can understand why so many people hate it, it's an easy film to criticise, it's not perfect by any means, but at the same time there's a very special meaning to much of it which is delivered in a very different way to other meaningful films. I think that this message is hugely overlooked in this film and as such this work bludgeoned by film goers. To me this film is an aesthetic tug against our fast paced, vulgar and narcissistic society. It provides a subtle and neat critique of all that is wrong with our modern selves; the now factor, the psychopathic lack of remorse for actions, the party as hard as you can, the vulgarity and tackiness of the pursuit of money. These are topics that the film handles well.",/review/rw2773240/?ref_=tt_urv

What a waste of time. I have watched it until end only to see will these stupid girls get some sense in them, big surprise, no they didn't.
