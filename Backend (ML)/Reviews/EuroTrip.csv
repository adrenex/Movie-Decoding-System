12 September 2021,markeitareid-10513,5," Tyler Perry's take on P VALLEY
","It was okay. I thought it would be better. Not terrible but bot great. Eva was better than expected but her lines at times are stiff but that's the writing. Says the same lines repeatedly. Guy who plays her nephew is fine as hell but acting can use some flow to it..felt like the same character from Sisters. The dancers were better actors. It just felt stiff. That being said I watched all episodes in one sitting and would tune in to season 2. Guy pleasure type show. The scenery is beautiful, sets amazing, wardrobe flawless, makeup gorgeous!.",/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2022,kitaylor-07508,1," ðŸ˜£ Painful
","The acting and writing in this series is so bad, it's actually comical. It takes a special skill to have a show this bad--terrible acting, terrible script--why y'all do this? I'm being a TRUE friend, because a true friend would have told you to not do this!!! The only worthy thing about this show are the men's bodies. And Eva was barely holding on, but she could only carry the show so far on her looks. The music was appropriate; maybe it should have been a silent movie.... I don't know. Me and my girls tried to really give it a chance, but it never got better. It was like the impossible meat trying to be angus beef. I'm sorry, not sorry for being honest.",/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2023,battlezone-29113,1," Please stop Tyler!!!
","First of from I saw it I just knew Tyler perry had something to do with it and I was right .....this isn't even worth 600 words to describe how bad this is ,ladies may like it but only because but if we are being honest this is garbage..unrealistic and corny ,who are these suppose to be gangster strippers with these corny looks and acting ,only because it's an all black movie I'm sure people gave it a second chance because if u critique it they'll say your a hater or if your white then you must be a racist...but all of Tyler Perry's films are trash especially if he acts in it other than being ""madea"" I can multi task whiles watching this crap ..talk on the phone answer the door not pausing it,warm some food up ,play a game all whiles not missing anything important,I never have to rewind only fast forward.",/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2021,anitramurray-47424,8," Should watch
","Wasn't expecting much from a Tyler Perry production but I was pleasantly surprised. Despite the not great writing, Eva did a really good job of convincing me she didn't come to play any games. There's no words to describe the actors that danced... had me fanning myself.",/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2021,mizzggtooyou,10," STRAIGHT CLASSY WITH a HINT OF GANGSTA
","I am so proud to see Tyler Perry stretch himself and do something out of the norm, along with giving black actors and actresses a chance to show their talents. I want him to cast me as Eva's mom since I know her from her time spent on ANTM, and when she lived at Museum towers by Centennial Park. Proud of her taking her acting serious. I have some good ideas Tyler Perry, contact me. =) I would give this 100 stars if I could. I called everyone I could and told them to watch the show. LOVED IT.",/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2021,aj-79481,10," Enjoyed greatly!!
","Bring on another season!!!, Please. This was an awesome series. I love the cast and the plot. Some scenes were a bit cheesy but entertaining.",/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2021,swaybrown,10," Good show
",Eva Marcille did a wonderful job! I had no idea she could act so well. I love the storyline and the actors are good. Can't wait for the next season.,/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2021,doctordre-69067,10," Please be a Season 2
",It's Creative and brings a twist on a more edgy Magic Mike vibe with this series.. I love where it's going and Congrats on Eva Pigford haven't seen here in years.,/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2022,noekenn,1," It's laughingly bad
",It's giving Foxy Brown meets Tyler Perry. I don't know who wrote this trash but it's embarrassingly bad and downright cringeworthy.,/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2021,acon0220,10," IT JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER WITH THE STORYLINE!!!!!!!!!!
","I absolutely love this show now. Watched ALL 10 episodes last week and was like Damn. This is really really good. The entire cast and crew did an amazing job putting this on. Thanks to Christian Keyes, Tyler Perry and all of the directors and producers for shooting this show at Tyler Perry Studios. This is a must see and cannot wait to see how the story continues to unfold each week. 10 out of 10.",/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv

",This show kept me on the edge of my seat!!!! Bring on season 2!,/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,stephanieb-48069,10," Great series!!
",I'm totally addicted to this show. So many beautiful men in one show. The cast is outstanding! I can't wait until this show returns. The Actors and Actress are outstanding. Love love this show!,/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2021,travismparker,10," Great Show
","I love this show, the actors & actresses are great. Christian Keyes has done a great job with this. I've watched every episode. Each is better than the last. I'm hoping it gets renewed for a new season.",/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2021,cpwssxm,10," Worth it! something DIFFERENT
",Far superior story lines and drama! So much better than other similar shows. Refreshingly different and interesting background realism into the lives of the characters that isn't false. Just needs a little more rapid flow.,/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2021,resilientkk,10," I love Eva!!
","First off the folks on here talking about it like they are on an episode of ""Men On"" HATED IT!!! I mean anyone could clearly tell before they watched it what it was going to be like! And to actually demean the show, all the while their asses watched the whole season is just truly pathetic. If it was so very despicable you seen that in the first 5 min so why keep watching it??? Giving the detail described you clearly watched it all, so at any time you could have stopped watching it! So obviously you must have a low key fetish for ghetto psychopaths! ðŸ¤£",/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2021,smatthews-83929,10," Especially for the women!!!
",I cannot wait for Season 2! I'm currently mad at myself for binge watching the entire season in 2 days. The dancers are EVERYTHING! The choreographed routines will have you smiling and fanning. I loved Eva's acting skills; She gave me boss b*tch who plays no games and the suits sealed the deal. Storyline is awesome! Some parts are little far-fetch but overall it's a great show in my opinion. Definitely looking forward to more seasons to come.,/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2022,osheadiggy,1," Terrible Acting
",The only difference between this show and P-Valley is that pvally has actual good writers and actors. The conversations between Eva Pigford and the other cast members is cringworthy. The awkward pauses in between each convo is beyond noticeable and hard to watch. Good luck with a Season 2.,/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,futuristicmikec,10," Great drama show
",I love Eva Marcille and always have she really does great as Madam in this series. I love seeing her play this role that she never gotten the chance to play before. Every single one of the cast members do an amazing job.,/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2022,lgordoncrick,1," Mr. Perry's gross form of entertainment.
",This show is just garbage. If someone thinks it's entertaining to watch someone going around and shoot disabled deaf people in the head like they did in the second season of the second episode given the recent shootings that are going on in this country. The episode should have been pulled from being broadcast. It was extremely disturbing especially when the main character joked about killing a group of deaf men with a bullet to their head. People need to start protesting to have this show canceled.,/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,luvleme1,10," Ratched-ness
",Really enjoyed this show and so happy all of the first series was in one lump sum. It makes me anxious to see Season 2. Highly upset if not. It's a must.,/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2021,loveissharingall,9," ALL HAIL THE QUEEN!
","I approached the first episode with an excitement and expectation that it would be more about the ""Queens Men"" but boy was I pleasantly surprised...The Queen was everything i needed with my popcorn. Magic Mike , Chocolate City's are more focused on the men, but no, no, not here! They share the spotlight perfectly. Only criticism was they should have slowed the various law enforcement agency's coming for Madame, and push back Blue getting locked up to future seasons. Its only season one, there was time for that. Nevertheless...what sealed the deal was the best male strip performance I've ever seen! Highly impressed, greatly unstressed. My hats off to all involved!",/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,ianderson-55865,1," Cultural Trash
","I wonder when we'll stop trying to make money off making Black culture look horrible and psychotic? As long as Tyler Perry is involved, I guess never. This was ridiculously horrible in both the plot and acting... unless you don't have 2 brain cells to rub together. And the bot accounts giving this 10 stars are very obvious. And please stop comparing this to P Valley. Just because it's about a strip club does not mean it's similar. IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE!",/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2021,cjrmnf,9," If it weren't for the male strippers, it would be a 10 for me...
",The writing is funny. Acting is stiff at times but some of the best lines seem straight up improv.,/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2021,tonistatonharris,7," A shero maintaining and kicking ass, gets me every time!
","This gets a 6 from me because the show has a good start and has room to grow. I appreciate the writing and Eva is believable and I like her. In spite of the bad, you root for Madam. She's ruthless and protective in the same vein. You also see her very real vulnerable spots, and that duality is refreshing. The eye candy is outstanding and the minor twist are enough to keep you going. The surprises are enough to bring you back. The beauty on the screen is breath-taking and to be one these cast members is to be one of the beautiful people.",/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2022,juniorsexton,10," LOVE THE CLIFFHANGERS!! This isnt a bot account lol
",I am a real person lol! I see alot of negative comments saying everyone writing fake reviews as if blacc ppl dont like shows like this. I love that Eva is continuing her acting! Tyler perry isnt the best at writing shows lol but this one is worth watching if you dont mind seeing men half naked lol.,/review/rw8519826/?ref_=tt_urv
