5 April 2020,claudio_carvalho,5," Clichés but Entertaining
","""Bloodshot"" is a poor collection of ""Universal Soldier"", ""Robcop"", ""Matrix"" and 'Memento"", among other films, that do not work well. The plot is absolutely predictable and it is possible to the viewer to foresee the story. Despite of the clichés, the viewer that is fan of Vin Diesel will certainly find the movie entertaining. My vote is five.",/review/rw6605549/?ref_=tt_urv

",Ray Garrison (Vin Diesel) is an American special force squad leader. He and his wife Gina are kidnapped and brutally murdered by mercenary Martin Axe. Tech entrepreneur Dr. Emil Harting (Guy Pearce) brings him back to life with new powers. KT (Eiza González) is another one of Harting's projects.,/review/rw6605549/?ref_=tt_urv

7 September 2020,classicsoncall,7," ""It's likely that what you think is real, sometimes ain't.""
","Even as far back as the Nineties, there were rumors of a movie being made based on a character from the Valiant Comics universe. I was a huge Valiant fan and collected all the titles up until the dissolution of Acclaim Entertainment in 2004. Bloodshot wasn't one of my favorites, I preferred 'Archer and Armstrong' for it's humor, and 'Eternal Warrior' for the time travel aspects of it's central character. But I did read 'Bloodshot', and it had an interesting premise with it's nanite technology and it's application for enhanced humans.",/review/rw6605549/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2020,Clive_W,2," Win for the worst effects
","The special effects in this film are average, the final fight scene was again pretty cool but did feel like an old style video game and the overall content felt weak, the story lacking, the characters rushed and random. I did find the psycho killer scene quite amusing, there were moments of humour throughout the film. At some point during the film I got very confused over location as one moment it was said location (a), then suddenly without explanation was location (b) and (c) in completely different countries within Europe... overall final feeling to the film was that if you want something to not pay attention to or a harmless bit of fun but if you want to engross yourself in the film this is not recommended.",/review/rw6605549/?ref_=tt_urv

","I don't get all the hate. It's a great action flick. Unrealistic, yeah definitely, but if I want something social-critic I would watch other stuff.",/review/rw6605549/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2020,trinaboice,5," Robotic soldier turns into...robotic soldier with nanotechnology
","IN A NUTSHELL:
Columbia Pictures offers a science-fiction drama based on the popular Valiant comic book Bloodshot (2019) Book 1. I wasn't familiar with the comic book character, but I always get a kick out of Vin Diesel and was ready for a fun popcorn flick. ""Welcome to the circus"" says one of the wounded/enhanced warriors when Ray Garrison joins the super-human squad of medically-enhanced bio soldiers. Cue the popcorn. Most people are calling this a ""one and done"", meaning it's entertaining enough to watch it once but it won't be anything people will want to watch over and over again.",/review/rw6605549/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2020,paul_haakonsen,5," Lots of action, but not an impressive script or storyline...
","Right, well I had the chance to sit down and watch the 2020 movie ""Bloodshot"" from director Dave Wilson. I had never heard about this movie prior to getting to sit down and watch it.",/review/rw6605549/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2020,masonsaul,5," Average
","Bloodshot is an average movie that's brought down by its extremely generic and predictable plot with nothing shocking, smart or original. Its also got some inconsistent CG and action sequences that border on being incomprehensible but are relatively enjoyable. However, Vin Diesel is great and Eiza González and Guy Pearce are both really good. Its pretty well paced and the music by Steve Jablonsky is good.",/review/rw6605549/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2020,penguin_holmes,4," Boring, Predictable and a mess
","I never saw the trailers, neither did I knew this was based on a comic-book. I just wanted to see a good action movie with Vin Diesel in it. I did not had my exceptions very high, but boy did it even went far beyond that.",/review/rw6605549/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is going to be a biased review ! Plain and simple ! I have never been and never will be a fan of Vin Diesel.....he simply cant act !! He is not an actor , he is like a stuntman that has got lucky and been forced into the public spotlight to be made into a star. He is not even a good action film actor............to me thats people like Tom Cruise , Liam Neeson and Keanu Reeves...............so your more than welcome to stop reading and downvote or whatever.",/review/rw6605549/?ref_=tt_urv

10 August 2020,santurcedc,10," I Enjoyed This Movie Filled With Lots of Action
","During the Covid 19 pandemic and the stay at home orders in many U.S. cities, I have been watching a lot of television. When this movie came out at the theaters, I read many bad reviews and I didn't go see it. I watched this movie on Starz premium cable channel and I enjoyed it. It was very entertaining with lots of action. However, I wished they filmed some of the scenes in a U.S. city with the guy walking through bad New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Los Angeles, Chicago, etc. fighting and killing thugs and drug dealers terrorizing innocent people in their communities. In my opinion, this would have made the movie more interesting.",/review/rw6605549/?ref_=tt_urv

14 June 2020,isantistao,9," Incredibly Amazing
","I don't usually like Vin Diesel movies. I think they are generally terrible. But this film is incredibly amazing. It blew me away. He doesn't do his normal bad acting style (which is probably mostly due to bad writing). And the action in this one is much more compelling. He plays a super hero type of role this time. And while the action is powerful, it is also a bit more deep and emotional than most action films, especially his. It is a really inspiring story that is very well written. And they brought it to screen with all of the best CGI and effects and production, creating a phenomenal looking film that stops just short of overdoing it. If you love action movies, this one will be an instant favorite.",/review/rw6605549/?ref_=tt_urv
