25 May 2016,bkoganbing,7," Family western series from Canada
","Living where I am in Buffalo, New York I'm fortunate to get a few Canadian television shows from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation which is on my cable package. If I didn't I wouldn't be seeing Heartland which I'm informed is Canada's longest running television series.",/review/rw3445896/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2009,bengleson,8," even for a non horse person, this is good story telling
","I confess this show is one of my clearly-no-longer secret pleasures. The stories of Heartland resonate with me in quite a different way then most of the pablum I watch on television. The travails of a multi-generational country family, the mix of urban experience and back to the horse-manure land operation, the western motif and the youthful tales of love, of coming of age, of environmental concern, well I find some comfort and a strong sense of just about lost values in the telling. Above all else, the story of the young horse whisperer is almost mystical. If it borders on trite from time to time, it is easy to forgive this creative slight. A very pleasant TV experience.",/review/rw3445896/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2013,tradewinds68,10," Good Old-Fashioned Entertainment
","Heartland is a true family show grounded in the values of times past but in a present context, leaving the viewer with a light and happy feeling at the end of each episode. It is a true delight to watch and the characters are incredibly genuine, making it easy to empathise with their lives and dilemmas. My son is 15 years old and as with other children his age, addicted to modern technology, yet since I discovered Heartland, we enjoy nothing more than sitting down in the evening and watching a few episodes as a family, something that I doubt no other PG-rated show could have achieved. I would recommend Heartland to everyone of all ages who wants to watch a heartwarming television show that brings its stories to life.",/review/rw3445896/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2021,backworld,9," good show..but..
","Like many other people, I have been watching this show since the beginning. I also really detest the characters of Lou & Tim...I am now on season 13 & whenever either of them are in the story line, I fast forward past the whining & me me me attitudes of both characters...both could be removed without hurting this good series..",/review/rw3445896/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2022,winginsue,6," Fun show BUT
","We are currently in season 3. We are enjoying the show but good heavens, I've never seen so many self-centered inconsiderate people in my life. How these people stay in any relationship is beyond me. Amy gets upset about the dumbest things. It can get SO frustrating watching it at times. I want to slap some of them on a regular basis.",/review/rw3445896/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2022,jleeharris-36991,6," So many annoying characters
","The main story with Amy and Ty is pretty good, but some of the supporting characters are unwatchable. I have to fast forward through any scenes with Mallory, Lou and Georgie. Either they are a control freak or a bratty kid or both. Georgie is the worst. If she isn't putting someone else in danger with her antics, she is maiming herself or destroying someone's property. She is a constant drama queen, sobbing and saying ""I'm sorry"". Its so unrealistic that she would not suffer any consequences for her sometimes dangerous behavior in a ranch setting.",/review/rw3445896/?ref_=tt_urv

","The beginning season were fantastic! An amazing family show! This series had so much heart and humor to it. I loved the way Amy could work with horses and help them with their problems. Everything about heartland; the cast; the storylines; the landscape, filming, everything was perfect. But after awhile, Amy's relationship with Ty became exhausting; the humor wasn't as good from the shifting of characters and storylines. But most of all, what happened to helping the horses? The majority of the show is about the personal drama instead of what made me fall in love with the show from the beginning. Helping solve an issue with a horse seems to be more in the background of the show instead of the face.",/review/rw3445896/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2020,mjwood-41-152434,5," Family?
","Because I love horses and beautiful mountain scenery, I have enjoyed the show. The writing is good just looking at the arc of the story, but I have a bit of a problem with the dialog between characters. They are rude to one another. All of them are with the exception of maybe Jack, Amy, and Ty. In addition, no child in the show is made to suffer the logical consequences of their behavior. This is especially true for Tim's and Georgie's character. Georgie will blatantly not do what she was asked and when a consequence is given to her, the adults rarely follow through. As a matter of fact she gets her way because she acted out. No child in real life would grow into the well rounded adult we see her moving towards. They would have simply been taught that I can do what I want when I want and still get to trick ride! I find it so unrealistic! Also, Tim is really rude, but everyone just puts up with what he does and says and so his behavior is tolerated as though it is normal. And it may be, with some people in real life, but someone who acts like he does would have few friends and be barely tolerated by family. It isn't normal in my world. If I talked to people at school where I work the way Tim Fleming talks to people, I would not hold a job for long. And Lou is so neurotic it is horrible. The world must revolve around her. So what if Jack and Lisa were married in a way that they wished to. Nothing wrong with that in my book. But to Lou, everything and everyone must meet her expectations or you are wrong! So, I don't think the give and take between characters is realistic. And worse than that, I think this show teaches kids that nothing is wrong with being rude, petty, and selfish. You get what you want anyway! Not a way to raise responsible people.
Thank goodness for the horses and scenery!!!",/review/rw3445896/?ref_=tt_urv

",I read the books when I was little and never knew they had been made into a TV series until this year so I had some major catching up to do! I can't really remember too much of the books just the basic bits which is probably a good thing. ,/review/rw3445896/?ref_=tt_urv

1 September 2015,justinpparkway,9," I'm a 32 year old man and I love it
","First off, I'm a 32 year old man living in Upstate New York. I drive a truck and have seen a horse up close maybe 3 times. I love this show. The acting is great and the script is written very well. Every now and then, you can predict something, but very rarely can you be specific. Everyone talks about the horses and the heartwarming tales. I agree with all of that. I'm writing this as of the completion of the 8th season. Ty's character was my favorite. I loved Amy as well, but Ty is the kid with the troubled past. I enjoyed how his past became relevant more than once. It's not like he moved and everyone back home forgot about him. He grew as a person and a man. Great things were portrayed in this show.",/review/rw3445896/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2014,dkl5664,10," Truly love it
","Love watching the show. My daughter and grand daughter love it too. Grand daughter is 2 and says horsey show mama. She would have it on all the time. Too cute. Wish we had more heart warming shows like this. I like the values it teaches. Family is so very important, and this shows a family's struggles and victories. Sleepless nights I turn on Heartland and have a marathon till morning. Wishing episodes 6-8 were available here. I will just have to wait. The story line and cast are excellent. Awesome family show. Makes me want to get baby girl a pony. Would love to see Calgary someday. It truly is beautiful. Would recommend watching this series, it will fill your heart with joy. Grew up with horses at grandfathers. So the story falls right in with all I remember growing up.",/review/rw3445896/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2017,oldyfan,," Love this show but two annoying characters
","I love Heartland as a feel-good show to watch. I love the horses and the scenery and most of the characters, particularly Jack. But I want to smack Lou and her dad, Tim. Both are selfish and don't really think about anyone but themselves. I guess that's just part of the show but Tim especially has no real redeeming characteristics and should just be ran off the ranch!",/review/rw3445896/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2018,lightheartedbeing,9," In the Land Where the Heart Rules
","Great story-telling in this series and every aspect is well produced: acting, writing, and the incredible scenery. I'm about halfway through the 12-season show, and am simply enjoying the heck out of it. The horses are great actors, too, and should win awards. It does seem everyone is doing most of their own riding, they make it all so very realistic. The lead Amy played by Amber is incredible, who knew one person could do so many different types of riding and do it well? Horse dancing, to dressage, to jumping, to rodeo, to racing, to communicating deeply with horses in a genuine heart-felt way gets conveyed incredibly well. There's lots of topics that reveal ranch life in today's world that is interesting as well. From wild horses to oil, class war, business vs. family life, addiction, native people's oppression and resilience, death and loss, relationship dysfunction, craziness and creative solutions (no sex). Then there's the whole healing aspect that comes from living in and/or visiting the land where the heart rules. The therapeutic work with the horses affects the people and vice versa in sometimes amazingly touching and profoundly metaphorical ways. The show goes deep and is lighthearted too. It cannot be an easy show for the actors to do because it is quite physically demanding. There's violence, though not too bad, fires, explosions, shooting, avalanches, rescues, fights, lots of action. The characters, including repeating characters and are so well-drawn and acted, you end up taking them to heart. There are a few places where what they do doesn't quite fit with them, what they know or would do in just a few situations, but otherwise the character arcs, their growth and development over the years is an incredible journey of the heart. Totally enjoyable for the whole family, too. If you don't love horses when you start this series, you will.",/review/rw3445896/?ref_=tt_urv

","Sorry, that headline might make you think I hate the show, but actually I'm loving it, for all the same reasons others have mentioned. Heartwarming, wonderful acting, good stories. But honestly, Lou and Tim and just plain insufferable. They're both self-centered, passive-aggressive, and frequently bullies.",/review/rw3445896/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2015,elaine_byrne,10," Wholesome Family Drama
","I discovered this series by accident on UP TV. The saga revolves around the multi-generational Fleming family on their Heartland ranch in Alberta. Grandfather Jack is a somewhat crusty individual who is the one everyone else turns to for advice and help in times of trouble. Amy is the central character, one of Jack's two granddaughters, who is, if you will excuse the expression, a horse whisperer. Lou is the other granddaughter, a good-hearted but often too aggressive take-charge person. Chris Potter plays Amy's and Lou's father, an x-rodeo cowboy always looking for a make-money scheme. His wife was killed in an accident, which plays heavily in the first seasons episodes. Ty Borden comes to Heartland on a temporary visit and stays on as his character grows in importance. These cast members, and all the other permanent or temporary cast members are fine actors. The scripts are well written and directed. Once you see a few episodes you will be hooked and look forward to the next and the next.",/review/rw3445896/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2019,hyacintoblack,7," Interesting for about 8 seasons
","It started good and was interesting. But later in the season it becomes more of a teenage frame (relationships are on/off, ""he kissed me!"", ""You kissed me!"", ""She kissed him!""...)
Got sick of it in the end.
The writers list the plot and the spirit of the series with the Mongolia adventures and subsequent story lines.
The first seasons were the best, definitely. After that not so interesting unless you're 16 and hormonal.",/review/rw3445896/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2019,posserider1996,10," Wow!! This is the best family movie we have watched
","We have watched this series from the beginning and bought all the dvds available to date . I am a former horse(many horses) owner and can relate to many of the situations seen on the series, Amber Marshall has grown up on the show and has a real compassion for horses onset and in her private life, so what you seen on screen is for the most part real feelings and emotions. All the actors on this show have great chemistry and a lot of fun to watch interact. if you live in the USA and want to watch current episodes of this show you can subscribe to UpTV and stream it. If you love horses or just a good down to earth family show to relax and watch you should give this a try, I do not think you will be disappointed. Have Fun",/review/rw3445896/?ref_=tt_urv

8 June 2021,bw-50712,9," Good show!
","I am late to the party on this show (I'm in season 5) and it's been really enjoyable. My only complaint is with Mallory and Lou. Mallory is way too annoying, and makes me want to hit ""mute"" when she's on. Lou often comes across as a diva. I know it seems like a negative review, but I love the other characters, the photography, scenery and of course, the horses. Will stick with it.",/review/rw3445896/?ref_=tt_urv

10 June 2020,ma-94743,6," Good show but same basic premise for each episode
","I watch this show with my wife and we enjoy it but it basically mimics what is wrong with the world today.
People don't communicate so there are constant misunderstandings and that is what the show seems to always be about, solving issues between each other and also a lot of characters sticking their noses into others affairs. The worst character in the show in my opinion is Mallory she is 13 year old who thinks she knows absolutely everything and not in the normal way you would expect a tween to. She has no respect whatsoever for the elders in the show. Example she tells Jack a 60ish year old man and patriarch of the family. ""Don't patronize me"". I cannot stand a child with a mouth like that. This seems to be a very good representation of the young people today and I can now see where they got it.",/review/rw3445896/?ref_=tt_urv

5 April 2016,gregorybmowery,4," Great Horse Show Saddled with Predictable Characters and Strange Behavior
","HEARTLAND is apparently Canada's premier TV drama. And when the show, which is set on a ranch in Alberta, Canada, focuses on the difficulties running a modern horse ranch, it's a lot of fun to watch. Yet all too often we're treated to ridiculous and predictable story lines that are preposterous and make the characters shallow. Let's start out with Amy (the appealing Amber Marshall), the granddaughter of the patriarch, Jack Bartlett (Shaun Johnston). Amy is a young horse-whisperer, who is something of a local legend. But every time she sees her boyfriend, Ty (Graham Wardle), she's an emotional mess. These two miss each other's signals all the time. Her sister, Lou (Michelle Morgan) is even worse. When the series opens, Amy's older sister returns to her grandfather's ranch to attend their mother's funeral. Lou is a mess of insecurities which all-too-often, she disguises by acting superior. She bosses everyone in the family, and when she finally finds the guy she loves, she does the same thing to him. When she gives birth to their daughter, she becomes a total control freak. Lou is smart and very good at business, but suffers from intense guilt as a mother. Her husband is the soul of patience, and I'm amazed at how nasty she can be. Their dad, played by Chris Potter with all the charisma he can manage, is perhaps the most unappealing of the clan. A first class womanizer, this ego-maniac always puts his own needs ahead of his two daughters. When he finds out he's the father of a young boy, he suddenly acquires a conscience. His daughters need to kick his selfish ass out of the house.",/review/rw3445896/?ref_=tt_urv
