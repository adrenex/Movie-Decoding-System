27 September 2021,atlasmb,7," A Humorous Balance
","""Home Economics"" is a comedy, nothing more. It is about an extended family in which one member is financially well-off and living on a different economic plane than his siblings. This generates some friction, in part due to envy, but also because one wing of the family---the sister in a biracial lesbian relationship-rejects anything on its face that appears to be un-woke.",/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2021,Okonh0wp,," Has some hidden depth in showing that adults
","Mostly an effort to fill the safe family programming hole left by ""Modern Family"" except this is a bit more generationally horizontal than vertical. The series centers on the lives of three adult siblings whose kids are roughly the same age. Their parents (Nora Dunn and Richard Kind) make occasional appearances but are safely in recurring guest star territory while the kids are about as important to the formula as ""Everybody Loves Raymond"": Screen time is doled out to them if it helps develop one of their parents' arcs. Frankly, they could have recast the kids in between episodes and I wouldn't have noticed.",/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2022,jennfinn,5," Seriously ?
","I've never been a fan of Topher Grace but I actually feel bad for him in Home Economics. His characters (Tom) only purpose seems to be the punching bag to his wife, brother, and sister. Jimmy Tatro plays his younger brother, Connor who is very rich, recently divorced and has a daughter. Jimmy is funny in very small doses but in this he's annoying, beyond stupid which makes it impossible to believe he's actually made a fortune in business.",/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2021,fastpuppy,5," A great cast absolutely squandered.

27 May 2021,moov_e_c_er,6," Still waiting...
","I'm 4 episodes in and still waiting for the point. Premise is one guy is a writer supposedly secretly writing about his family yet episode 4 doesn't open ""chapter 4"" like the previous style. If you have a bible for the show follow the damned thing: if you don't make one BEFORE you shoot second episode and adjust if needed. Topher's physical comedy of tripping works first time but next time is like a flashback (doesn't work most of the time). Based on cast and subject matter this show has so much potential but the organization of characters, dialogue, and editing is garbage. Fire everyone but the actors and start again. I'll keep watching just because I'm bored and maybe it will become something?",/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2022,IdaSlapter,3," Like Modern Family...
",...without the chemistry or laughs.,/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2021,and_shove_it_up_your_butt,7," It's got potential!
",I'll give it a chance to be fine tuned over the first season because some things aren't dialed in yet. Overall though it's pretty funny if you are into dry humor.,/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2021,ghcheese,9," Is this the new Modern Family
",Good start. I hope it continues. Modern Family had the right mix. Everyone was smart in their own way. Everyone was an idiot in their own way. No one was better than the other. As a group they were great. This seems to be on the same road but time will tell. I hope so. I miss Modern Family.,/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2021,fleck05IMDB,," What's your dog's pronoun?
","Three west coast siblings - two brothers and a sister - try to get along without microagressing each other. One bro is an uber-rich recently single dad, the other bro is a struggling writer with a wife attorney and twins, while sis is one-half of a biracial lesbian couple that's been laid off from her job. When the middle class brother asks the millionaire brother for a loan, sis is quick to play the ""white privileged much"" card. They argue, but agree to help each other because they're family.",/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2021,aprilsfriendorin,5," Promising but stills needs to find its footing
","I started this show because the cast seemed great. However, the writing definitely needs help. I'm a few episodes in and so far I would label the show as ""average."" Not terrible, but not great either. It has a few funny moments but the majority just seems like filler content. The sister is also a ridiculously obnoxious character (unfortunate that they wrote their main female character to be the most stereotypical ""woke"" person ever).",/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2021,Thinker365,7," Fair to reasonable with scope to improve!
","The best thing going for this is its likeable cast and its interest in topics which rarely get airing, particularly given it's a sitcom.",/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2021,jessegar-74378,7," It's cute.
","I like it, the actors are pretty good and likable. Topher needs to stop with the stupid clumsy acts. They look so scripted and it doesn't work. He doesn't have the comedic timing that the other brother has in his scenes. The sister is kind of annoying but comes together with her wife. I hope the show continues and grows more in-depth characters. I feel it might be the a good show in the spring lineup.",/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2021,mcc-08445,1," Watch it if you hate comedy
","This is the most boring and lifeless tv show. I would be surprised if they have 2nd, 3rd seasons. Haven't even smiled yet. Writing is extremely poor, directing is horrible and actors have no clue what is going on. Don't waste your time. You are better of with re-runs.",/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2021,Barry0169,3," Life Is tToo Short
","Life is too short to waste on this drivel. It strives to be Life in Pieces or maybe The Unicorn, but falss way short. A sitcom should make you laugh. After three laughless episodes, I've removed it from ,my DVR list -- anything is better than watching this show.",/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2021,rachsangster,9," Why so negative?!
","I'm through the pilot and part of episode two, I thought it was pretty great so far. Some points where I laughed out loud, some times where I just giggled. I wish people could just watch a show for what it is and not read in to things so far. I have a surprise for you guys, not everything is a conspiracy, not everyone has an agenda. Sometimes a TV show is just a TV show, that is in line with the dynamics of families this day and age. Shocking, I know.",/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2021,adamchurvis,10," FINALLY a sitcom that covers financial disparities between family members
","Handles the uncomfortable really well without forgetting to make it appropriately funny. And ANYTHING with Sasheer Zamata is worth watching; she's like a ""Secret Sauce"" that improves the taste of anything you put it on.",/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2021,lolly67,8," Some pretty good laughs so far
","I went in without any expectations and loved that I laughed throughout both episodes I've seen so far. My favorite is, Karla Souza.....since I watched every episode of every season of How to Get Away with Murder.",/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2021,fasterwaysara,9," Fun first episode!
",Thought this was a great introduction to the family! Loving the fact that no one is perfect and the cast did a nice job being likeable. Love all the Matt Damon references and hope maybe he will make a guest appearance sometime! Been looking for a good comedy that makes me laugh and this seems promising!,/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2021,sbsieber,1," One star says it all
","I watched episode four last night and found it painful, and unfunny. The situation is contrived, characters are irritating, and the actors seem to think that zany equates entertaining. It does not. I was especially irritated when one of the spouses scolds her father-in-law in the proper pronunciation of her twin children's names, giving them a heightened Spanish accent, and roll of the rrrrrs. Sorry, but I am not going to call someone 'Ferrrrnnado' just because you tell me to. 'Fernando' is just fine. In any case - not recommended.",/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2021,rftt,7," It's pretty good
",It kinda reminds me of Life in Pieces with some of the quick dialogue!! It's true that a few of the jokes are a little over the top with the diversity theme but I thought it was and probably will be pretty good!!,/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2021,nickventura-98896,10," Wow went in with low expectations just to be entertained
","Anyone rating this lower than a 7 is clearly just annoyed at certain parts about the show; which I could agree with. Although it may be awkward at times, this show promises a good and funny cast along with ridiculous events that happen throughout the season. Only 2 episodes in, but I love it. It's a relaxing comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously. Like I said, anyone giving this below a 7 is just looking to hate on something to make themselves feel better.",/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2021,RandomTard,4," Not good but not disasterous
","With this show you get exactly what you would of guessed. It is very politically correct and diverse, so naturally it is therefore boring and unfunny. And since it is not funny it of course does get second season, because reasons.",/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2021,degaswilson,9," OMG
",Wow. Was really good. I love Toper Grace.,/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2021,cherold,6," Funnier around the edges than in the center
","Home Economics is a ""family with mild conflicts working out those mild conflicts while being funny and stupid and then everyone hugs"" comedies about three siblings, whose only gimmick is one is rich, one is temporarily struggling, and one is what passes for poor in a movie about upperclass white folk.",/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2021,SamanthaZell,3," It's bad, but no one is actually saying why
","This honestly might have been the worst first episode for a sitcom I've ever seen. But, of course, the only thing the negative reviews are talking about is the diversity of the cast. So here's an ACTUAL review for you.",/review/rw6795952/?ref_=tt_urv
