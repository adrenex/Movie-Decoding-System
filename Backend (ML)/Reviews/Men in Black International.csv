8 December 2019,pawanpunjabithewriter,7," It's a child movie, but yeah, you can watch it. It has a lot of fun! Do not consider the Age bar
","I was just chilling down, was looking to watch some movie with less or no expectations which made me turn down to this one.
It turned out to be an above average movie.
If you like animated stuff, don't miss this. Right after 20 minutes of the movie, I started becoming curious what's next in the movie. The climax amazed me. Should, should have run a little longer. The direction was superb. All boxes and characters ticked right from the start. A completely satisfying end to the movie.",/review/rw1569842/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2006,manicgecko,8," Very pleasant surprise
","Here I am, taking my 2 year old to a movie expecting to be bored stiff. Much to my surprise, my 8 year old also enjoyed it, and my 2 year old sat enraptured and watched the entire movie without a peep. And then talked non-stop about it for the next couple days. That is enough for a positive rating, but I also found myself enjoying this cute movie. Usually for that to happen the movie makers have to put in scenes just for the parents that the kids don't get at all, not here, I found myself chuckling at the same things my daughter did. Just simple innocent monkey business and a bumbling Will Ferrel, it needs no more. I even thought the additions by Jack Lullaby Johnson added to the movie, not just to put the parents asleep. We will definitely end up with this movie on our shelves for the kids, and even the parents can watch it one or 2 more times without going out of our minds with the typical substitute stupid for cute fare that usually passes for children movies.",/review/rw1569842/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2006,meccano,10," ""...a reminder of what a CHILDREN'S animated movie is supposed to be like""
","Wow, what a rare treat. A children's animated movie the is completely and totally suitable for children of all ages. I am not easily offended by movies for adults, but as a parent I am simply amazed at how much children's entertainment is really NOT fit children. Cat in the Hat, also from Ron Howard and Imagine, was rude and crass. I am embarrassed when my six year old repeats lines from the movie like the whole dirty hoe thing and all that. This movie is a very gentle and kind movie. No double meanings, no sexually explicate or pop culture references to keep adults interested. A favorite children's book, that with any luck, will be a favorite children's movie. I have a feeling that this film may not be a box office success, yet I still think that it will have a very long life for many years to come on DVD and cable because it is such a great entertaining movie for kids. The Jack Johnson music is perfect. The animated style is wonderful. It is not the all-new and important CGI animation, but a traditionally animated film that uses the old styles that have all but been abandoned in feature films This is the best Disney animated movie that I have seen in the past decade. Well, of course this film isn't made by Disney, but this is the type of film that they should be making, even if only occasionally, as a reminder of what a CHILDREN'S animated movie is supposed to be like. In a way, the film is even sweeter than the stories from which it is based. I really can't find anything wrong with this film for children and as a parent, I was much happier to watch it than Garfield or Shark Tales (both of which I sleep through).",/review/rw1569842/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2006,Ronald_Mexico,9," Surprisingly, ""curiously"" good
","I'll admit it: when I first saw the trailer for ""Curious George"", it inspired in me little more than an eye-roll and a deep sigh of martyrdom. As of late, Hollywood has had a fascination with remaking children's stories from earlier decades, producing such atrocities as ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", ""The Cat in the Hat"", and ""Bad News Bears"" (to name just a few). Taking the misguided notion that people actually want to see modernized versions of these stories and combining it with the voice talents of perhaps the most overrated comedy star in Hollywood (Will Ferrell) seemed, at first glance, to be a recipe for certain disaster.",/review/rw1569842/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2006,alane8500,9," A sure bet for preschoolers and kids at heart.
","Anymore animated movies are trying to appeal to adult audiences with crude humor, and double meanings. If I wanted to see an adult movie, I would get a babysitter. This is a movie FOR CHILDREN. I took my 2 and 3 year old girls to see it. It is a visually stunning rendering of the classic children's books. George is wholesome, endearing, and charming. The whimsical animation style breathes life to the character we remember fondly from our youth. He exudes youthful exuberance and energy and mischief.",/review/rw1569842/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2006,EpeeBill,7," A kids movie that is actually for kids
","I took my two-year-old son to see this movie, his first in a theater, and we both had a great time. Curious George is a light-hearted, sweet movie that portrays our little monkey's mayhem without resorting to manic pacing, blaring music or wise-cracking.",/review/rw1569842/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2006,3s2m,8," Great for kids, good for adults, Will Ferrell aside. Why Disney gave up traditional animation is beyond me
","Universal Studios and Imagine Entertainment have, in the past, co-conspired to produce two truly offensive cinematic travesties of iconic children's books: ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" and ""The Cat and the Hat"". With ""Curious George"" I am delighted and relieved to say that in this instance tragedies do not come in threes. Simple, charming, attractively animated (by hand, with some 3D effects which blend in well), appropriate for kids, with no Seinfeldian self- consciousness or Adam Sandler-style gross-out humor, this film is near perfect.",/review/rw1569842/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2006,jthomp6-1,10," Very charming, not a sour note in the entire film!!
","My wife and I took our 9-year-old to see a sneak preview of ""CG"" over the weekend. Going into it, I had reservations--I loved the books and illustrations when I was younger, but I thought my son wouldn't like it & that I would just zone out for 90 minutes. I WAS WRONG! The animation is very well done, probably more computerized than hand-drawn, George thankfully does NOT talk, and the characters are given enough depth & background to sustain a plot for a children's film. The film takes some of the most memorable scenes from the original books & melds them in with the story about a search for a lost idol. The film's humor is aimed squarely at kids & kids at heart. Unlike ""Shrek,"" there are no jokes that pass over kid's heads to make the adults laugh--kids & adults alike were howling with laughter at the screening we saw, & my wife even teared up a little at one emotional point. The film has a bouncy background soundtrack made up of songs that sound like something Paul Simon would write. Thoroughly enjoyable, worth seeing, & nothing in it to offend anyone of any age.",/review/rw1569842/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2006,court_marie,10," Soooo Cute!
","First off I have to say that I am a huge Curious George fan and have been since I was a little girl. I have to admit that when I saw that they were making my beloved little monkey into a feature film, I was incredibly nervous that his legacy would be ruined. But the movie opened today and my boyfriend and I went to the first matinée at the theater and I LOVED it! I thought it was adorable and true to the style and story of the original book. I loved everything about it. The animation was great, it was nice to see something NOT computer animated for a change. Jack Johnson's music was a perfect fit and watching basically morphed me back 18 years into a 5 year old kid again. It brought me back to watching the old animated stories I watched with my little brother. I think this will be a great thing for getting kids to go and read the books as well. I was in a Borders later in the afternoon and saw two kids buying books and overheard a phone call asking about what books were carried there.",/review/rw1569842/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2012,djansen24,7," Great for small kids!
","Curious George is a rare thing in Hollywood these days: a big budget feature ($50,000,000) that is specifically tailored to small children. Oh yes, they could have possibly made more of a profit had it been a straight to DVD release or put in less effort into the animation, but the studio decided to have some balls, take a risk, and go all out for this feature. I am so glad they did! This film avoids a lot of the pop culture references that one finds in most animated features and decides to focus on George's antics. That was a very good decision. Kids can identify with a curious monkey with seemingly limitless energy, an excitable innocence, and fun filled nature. The opening credits clearly establish the personality and good humor of George, and it just gets better from there. Jack Johnson was commissioned to write the music, and his whimsy is a perfect compliment to the mood of the movie. No, it is not a perfect film that transcends the genre of animated movies and there are plot holes. But in a film so fun loving and innocent, who cares about the small details. This film is appropriate from age 2 and up. Parents will enjoy seeing their kids laugh and having a good time. Simply put, if you want something safe for kids to watch, get this movie. Or better yet, read them the original Curious George stories.",/review/rw1569842/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2011,TheLittleSongbird,8," Cute, clean and charming
","I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. It mayn't be an animated classic, but it is so cute, amusing, clean and charming you find it so easy to like. The traditional animation is nice and colourful, with the pretty backgrounds especially standing out, and the soundtrack is very bright and breezy. The dialogue also amuses, the opening sequence is an inspired touch and the story while thin and predictable perhaps is nice and simple, easy to follow and goes along at a cracking pace thanks to George's mishaps. Not only that, it sticks to the spirit of the terrific books. The characters are engaging, especially George who is just adorable and steals every scene he's in. The voice work overall is terrific, Will Ferrell I am not a fan of but he does a solid job voicing a likable character, Drew Barrymore is appealing and it is a delight hearing Dick Van Dyke again. In fact, Curious George's only real problem, or so in my view, is that it is too short. In conclusion though, it is delightful. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw1569842/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2007,Dingataca,," I'll be honest....I LIKED it!
","I thought I would be bored out of my SKULL seeing this, but I really enjoyed a lot of this movie. I am glad I watched this with some friends and their siblings, and by the end of it we were all pretty cheerful, Curious George is such a gentle, light feel-good movie!

8 February 2006,richa333,9," Great Fun for everyone with a young heart!
","From the very first moment that Curious George scampers onto the screen to begin his funny adventures, my heart was swept away with laughter. All my cares disappeared while my wife and I giggled with all the other kids, very young and very old, watching George do his best to do the right thing  only to get in more and more trouble from the adult animals all around. Soon George (a 'monkey'  actually a chimpanzee) finds better times with the animal children, whom he gathers around a chameleon that they light up like a rainbow disco strobe.",/review/rw1569842/?ref_=tt_urv

","I remember reading the books as a CHILD, so i wasn't sure what i was in for when i took my son to see the movie.... well needless to say WE loved it.. yes, i said WE! i enjoyed myself.. and as we left the theater my son and I agreed this is one movie we will buy! :) it kept us laughing the whole time. and truly was unlike other children movies i have taken my son too... this one actually had parents interested and laughing along with our children. Not often that happens. Movie was well made. I wish i knew when we could be expecting it to be released on DVD. the excitement is killing my son,.. OK I will admit, I cant wait to own it and watch it again with my son! TWO thumbs up!!!",/review/rw1569842/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2006,aharmas,10," The Magic is Back
","Watching ""Curious George"" reminded me of what it is that takes me to the movies: an communal experience where the silver screen grabs you, bewitches you for 90 minutes with a well-told and executed story. There are segments in ""George"" when you have to catch your breath because the screen is bursting with color, music, and magic. The use of primary colors, the simple, yet sweet and touching story pulls you forward with sure footing.",/review/rw1569842/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2006,RobRoseW,10," finally a FAMILY movie!!!!!!!!
","FINALLY someone has actually made a family movie. No sly innuendo, pop culture references or nonsense! My kids thoroughly loved it and its proof that these Hollywood people can stop trying to please the selfish segment of adult society that wants themselves to be entertained by Children's movies.Growe up! This movie, like all kids movies should be, is for kids.It was thoroughly entertaining and is the first kids movie in some time that seemed to actually have been made for kids. Let them be kids...not adults. ..and enjoy this thoroughly entertaining movie!!!!It was well written, our kids enjoyed the music and laughed a lot. if they made more kids movies like this our family would go out to the movies far more often. Our kids loved the books and the film was fairly true to the books. They finally did a kids movie for kids with no hidden Hollywood agenda.",/review/rw1569842/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2006,dharper-12,9," True to Spirit
","Attended the world premiere yesterday for Curious George. The movie is true to the spirit of the original work of the Reys'. For a full-length animated feature that was under a tremendous production schedule (not counting the 14+ years of development), Imagine Entertainment really pulled it together quite well. The traditional 2-D animation, a collaboration of from animators in over 10 countries, is very good and a nice throwback and change from all the CGI animation more prevalent today. What really makes this film are the songs by Jack Johnson--the two fit together perfectly. Overall, this is a cute movie and a perfect way to spend an afternoon or evening with your young children. For those adults who grew up with Curious George, they too will not be disappointed in the film's light-hearted, warm approach to the original character.",/review/rw1569842/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2006,guerillagorilla,9," Family Film? It's about time!
","My introduction to the world of ""Curious George"" before seeing the movie adaptation was to read a couple of his books to my nephew a few weeks prior. During, it became pretty clear to me that I wish I'd been so introduced when I was little. I thought it was just so cool that there are still children's books that are highly revered for their ability to inspire kids to be curious and enthusiastic about their surroundings - as opposed to just the ones that inspire action through superstrength or superpowers (or at least to little kids, they're superhuman). Those books are fun too, without a doubt, but they just don't seem to make that great of a lasting impression at the outset.",/review/rw1569842/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2009,Trangor,9," Polished for kids and big kids

19 April 2022,HotToastyRag,4," Changes the charm of childhood
","As any self-respecting fan of the Curious George series would, I flocked to see the full-length theatrical movie released in 2006. As much fun as it was to hear Will Ferrell voicing the Man in the Yellow Hat - and believe me, I really enjoyed it - I did miss Jeff Bennett's original voice from the television series (although he does give a cameo as a salesman). Since Frank Welker got to keep his employment in the movie and voice George, it seemed a little unfair that Jeff didn't also have the privilege.",/review/rw1569842/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Curious George "" a animated movie inspired in the books following the adventures of the monkey George ,it just simply a wonderful and cute movie for all the family . One of the best things of this movie is that if you consider that in this days almost all the movies are made by computer , this dares to use traditional animation ,but it looks pretty good and actually it seems more ""Alive "" than the 3D movies . Second ,it don't try to be ""subversive "" as the other stupid animated movies that tries to use toilet humor and sex references to catch the adult audience , and it never forgets for what audience it was aimed .
