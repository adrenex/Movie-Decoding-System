1 February 2018,deloudelouvain,8," Hardcore revenge at it's best.
","I have to admit I didn't expect much of a movie with a title like Brawl in Cell Block 99. It's not the most appealing title, that's the least we can say. But it was actually a good action movie with some pretty hardcore violent scenes. Some people will find them a bit harsh to watch, but I didn't mind it at all, I even applaud it. It's gore but also funny to me. So if you read negative reviews about this movie it will come from people that can't cope with violent scenes like in this movie. The story isn't bad at all, even if it was a bit predictable. But since it is an action movie I was not expecting a difficult story. A good revenge story, nothing beats making your own justice. Vince Vaughn has the physique to play his character. His fighting scenes might be a bit slow but they fitted his character perfectly. So if you like me like hardcore revenge movies you will probably like this one as well.",/review/rw3871136/?ref_=tt_urv

","I loved this film as soon as I watched it. Yes, yes, yes, I craved for this movie, although I also perfectly understand that many folks don't. I can understand that the terrific and unbearable graphic violence depicted here may be disturbing for many audiences. Those skull crashing scenes are unbearable, I admit. That reminds me AMERICAN HISTORY X sequence with Eddy Norton doing the same as a skinhead, puting the jaw of his opponent on the sidewalk edge, and then brutally crashing, smashing it. But I did not love BRAWL...for this reason, of course. I would be a dumb if I only did. No, I also loved this film for the story, this so desperate tale, of a hero lost in advance, and faced to his own doom. The Don Johnson characters is also terrific. This eally looks like a QT movie, atmosphere, of course. It could have been another Tarantino feature. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS
 The most interesting element here is not the skull, face crashing matters, but the diabolical scheme. The poor guy sent to high security jail ONLY to be executed by the inmates - working for the organization whom he provoked the three millions dollars loss - but eventually killed by the prison guards and warden, I presume ALSO Under contract by the organization to get rid of him. He was not sent to the HS jail to kill another ""invisible"" man. HE WAS THE ULTIMATE TARGET, because he was out of reach for this same organization in the first jail. Follow me?
 At least, that's what I understood.",/review/rw3871136/?ref_=tt_urv

","Well throughout film history we've all enjoyed a good prison movie watch am I right?! Stallone bringing it in with Lock Up, that was my first looks into the prison life setting. Relatively young, with no prison experience behind or in front of me fortunately this film made you never commit a crime. there has been many others through out film history that have stuck with us over the years, one of this generation that just might stick for a while is Brawl in Cell Block 99 staring Vince Vaughn. This hard look and rough life of the main character is brought to you by the man behind Bone Tomahawk, if you haven't seen Bone yet please do so, building quite a following from cult fans and Hollywood actors is steadily growing. this man is S. Craig Zahler, writer, director, even composer of this film which is great. Normally wearing many hats in the industry means you have too because your an independent filmmaker, the budget is there so I'm sure its for creative control of the film, written and directed I'm sure its creative control of the film that is produced is exactly what you've envisioned. Now onto Brawl in Cell Block 99, don't be deceived by title, its sort of a brawl throughout multiple locations. We start with the main character Bradley Thomas who is a repo man that gets fired at the start, just in the first 10 minutes you surely get the feel that this character is going to battle throughout, life is going to throw it at him one punch at a time. after being fired and going home he sees his wife lauren Thomas played by the very talented Jennifer Carpenter, looks like she's had a long night sort a speak and he see's this and loses his temper. Its evident at this point that Bradley is going to go through it for sure. Bradley looking for a new job and a way to pay the bills, has to resort to his past life, running drugs, guns, etc. you name it for his employer Gil ( Marc Blucas) and his associates. needless to say things go south while taking one of these jobs and costs a few people a lot of money, thus going to prison on a plea would've been nice, at first its a minimum security prison, very lax and some of the others there are friendly and warm up to him, then Bradley receives a visitor at the prison Placid Man ( Udo Kier) and tells him that his wife and they're unborn child would be harmed in a most gruesome way if he does not kill a fellow inmate in the prison, but not this one, a different prison that is a high security maximum penitentiary run by warden Tuggs (Don Johnson) and its a lawless place basically void of life for the worst of the worst criminals. Ill let who ever reads this extend their time to watching it because it is a decently directed, well acted film, but let me forewarn you, just like his other films S. Craig Zahler has under his belt he shows you not a quick story to be rushed through, these films build characters, locations, and more importantly the will to watch a longer film and feel like its not dragging you across concrete, little pun there. Overall Vince, Jennifer, Udo, and many other cast members truly bring this universe to life for Bradley Thomas, so enjoy the ride, or should I say the Brawl in Cellblock 99.",/review/rw3871136/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2018,Leofwine_draca,10," Excellent little film
","With the two-fer of this and BONE TOMAHAWK, writer/director S. Craig Zahler is quickly becoming one of the most interesting talents working today. The good news is that BRAWL IN CELL BLOCK 99 is every bit as good as BONE TOMAHAWK and very similar, although it takes place in an entirely different genre and with an entirely different story. Vince Vaughn - away from comedy in this and HACKSAW RIDGE and turning out to be a fine actor - plays a small-time drug runner who ends up in prison after a pick-up goes wrong. His situation becomes perilous when his pregnant wife is kidnapped by gangsters and he's forced into pulling off a seemingly impossible task. This is one of those films which gets darker and darker as it goes on, detailing man's inhumanity to fellow man in unflinching detail. As a prison film it looks extremely dark, dirty, and depressing. But Vaughn's moral characters keeps you drawn into the story, and the suspense gradually builds until the film's reaches a cathartic climax which has some of the most brutal violence you'll see in the cinema all year. It's an incredible, tour-de-force ending, unflinching and unafraid, and it tops off what has been an excellent little film overall.",/review/rw3871136/?ref_=tt_urv

","Brawl in Cell Block 99 is the long awaited sophomoric effort from the brilliant S. Craig Zahler, the director of the 2015 surprise hit Bone Tomahawk. Brawl in Cell Block 99 tells the story of Bradley Thomas (played by an unrecognizable and equally amazing Vince Vaughn), a former boxer whose life is in a bit of a downward spiral. After he is let go from his mechanic job, he comes home to find his wife carrying on an extramarital affair. After dismantling her car with impressive accuracy, Bradley makes up with his wife Laura (Jennifer Carpenter) and the two decide to continue their marriage but Bradley wants to dabble into the criminal underworld in order to provide his future family the life they deserve. Fast forward a couple months, Laura is pregnant and Bradley is a drug runner. When a deal goes south and forces Bradley to get arrested and lose the shipment which results with him getting a light prison sentence at a cushy prison. After being visited by a drug czar's henchmen, Bradley is told that Laura and his unborn child will die if Bradley does not kill an inmate in Cell Block 99. Without giving too much more away, Bradley then becomes a one-man wrecking crew that is willing to do vile and brutal things to ensure the lives of his family are safe.",/review/rw3871136/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hits hard like ""The Boys Next Door"" meets ""Walking Tall"". The film is extremely unrealistic(in many ways), but Vaughn is solid. He sells this character. The fight scenes are choreographed quite well, and are far more realistic than the settings and timeline. It's a real strength for the film. You feel every punch and Vaughns strength really manifests itself on the screen. Kudo's to the director/choreographers. Plenty of action throughout - also enough playful sarcasm to keep it from being too heavy handed. ",/review/rw3871136/?ref_=tt_urv

","Vince Vaughn does a great job of portraying a no-nonsense tough guy who doesn't mince his words in this prison drama. I was surprised how much i enjoyed this movie. His character brings to mind characters similar to what Charles Bronson, Clint Eastwood and the like have played. There is a real intensity about this movie and his performance that is lacking in many action films these days. The supporting cast were good also but i thought Vince Vaughn totally carried this movie, which could have been way worse but for what he brought to it.

He did not disappoint. Him playing a redneck tough guy had me in stitches.

17 April 2018,jtindahouse,10," Proof that Vaughn could have played Jack Reacher in one of the best films of 2017
","Vince Vaughn is criminally underrated as a serious actor. I think people assosiated him the 'Psycho' remake early in his career and he never really recovered from it. He's obviously well known as one of the best comedic actors going around (with the right script) but very rarely do you hear him mentioned when it comes to the serious stuff. In 'Brawl in Cell Block 99' he is captivating to watch. The mixture of emotionless bad-ass with quick, witty and genuinely funny one-liners (the good kind, not the cheesy type) was nailed down to a fine art. In fact it lead me to believe that he would have in fact been the perfect choice for the title role of 'Jack Reacher' back when it was being cast. In a lot of ways he's basically playing 'Reacher' here in this movie. People forget too that he is an enormous human being.",/review/rw3871136/?ref_=tt_urv

","Didn't really know what to expect going into this as most reviews I've seen people either loved it or hated it. Me personally I dug this classic throwback to the prison exploitation films of old. It doesn't really get going till Vaughn (who it's nice to see in something other than a comedy for once) is sent to prison, but after that it's pure entertainment with some solid brutality and ultra-violence. Throw in some appearances from Don Johnson and Udo Kier and you got another top-notch winner here from S. Craig Zahler.",/review/rw3871136/?ref_=tt_urv
