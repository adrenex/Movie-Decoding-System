","I really do not understand some bad reviews here. I mean Ok, you can talk about irresponsability and the son is maybe a little bit annoying, but everyone can happen this anytime. You can find yourself in a miserable situation to lose your dog and ofcourse there is no one to blame but yourself.",/review/rw8802407/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,DarkVulcan29,9," Surprisngly enjoyable
","I first thought that this was gonna be real silly with campy like acting, the trailer on Netflix made it seem like it was gonna seem that way, but has I watched the film, it started to grow on me, for anybody who every has loved a dog, I believe will find this movie enjoyable.",/review/rw8802407/?ref_=tt_urv

","We wanted a brief break from bloodthirsty Vikings battling it out so we decided to go for a totally different, feel-good film that leaves you thinking, actually, there are some lovely people in this world.",/review/rw8802407/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,rufusmcd,10," What is with all the hate?
",""" These people are terrible. They made the wrong choices . They are rich and are able to do this"" Really? The movie The Titanic has rich arrogant people in it too who made a slew of wrong choices but somehow everyone loves that movie. How about the fact they made mistakes which apparently none on the haters never do. How about basing your review on the movie and not the real people its based on. Its a nice feel good movie that been done a thousand times before. The reason for that is people like to see other people find their pets. I suppose none of you have never lost a pet or anything else that was dear to you. Check yourselves.",/review/rw8802407/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2023,gracelamprell,7," Cheesy but a nice watch
","Only really a movie for people who own and love dogs but definitely will make you smile. I didn't think I was particularly invested until the ending when I was suddenly crying so they definitely pull at the heart strings. The acting from the main boy was really good, shame some of the material he had to work with wasn't always great. There was a side story about the son which did seem a bit unnecessary and probably that time could have been put toward some more content of the missing dog on his little adventures which I did think there needed to be more of. Also very distracting that the dog had a weird goofy name but then again it's a true story so they have to honour the original doggo. Enjoyed overall!",/review/rw8802407/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2023,irmamarie-937-495593,9," Don't listen to those knocking this film
","First off, I must say, Rob Lowe has gotten better looking with age. I do not understand the reviews talking about the son being annoying. What reality do you live in? I thought the character reflected many young people who graduate from college and feel lost. The love for his dog was heartwarming. I really enjoyed this movie. Knowing that it is a true story, it restores my faith in humanity. So many good people helped the family.",/review/rw8802407/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,PotatoSkit,7," Jamesasrose the pretentious ""dog trainer"" know it all
","Decent movie, I mean I cried so of course it's one of those movies that def hit at your heartstrings. If you're up for a cheesy tear jerker and you need a therapeutic cry then watch it. If not then don't. It won't win any Oscar's nor will it awe you with amazing acting. If you've seen enough dog movies you know what you're in for. Also, it's your doggie you can train it and raise it however you want. As long as they're loved and cared for everything else falls into place. My dogs (2 very healthy happy dogs) were never properly trained and they're the happiest dogs. So do and raise your dogs as you wish and give them all the love:)",/review/rw8802407/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,maheushellie,10," A Really Heartfelt Film
","This movie was really heartfelt. But I am not only a dog lover but I love all animals. I am certainly glad I don't go off of the ratings, especially what's written, when deciding to watch a film. This movie is about a young man in college trying to find his way. He experiences rejection from his peers and even parents for him not knowing what his career path is. He sees a dog out at campus one day, and decides to get himself a dog too. He finds himself the perfect dog at a shelter, who needed him as much as he needed the dog. Then while walking on a trail with his friend, the dog wasn't on his leash, and starts chasing a fox, and gets lost in the mountains, which is not hard to believe, and it was very sad and relatable too.",/review/rw8802407/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2023,kateann1027,2," Based on a true story but did not need to happen
","The relationship between Gonker and his irresponsible, uninformed human is a love beautiful to see. Unfortunately for Gonker letting a dog off leash in the woods with a strong prey drive and no strong recall response is a horrible and tragic thing to do. His parents thinking a shock collar is a responsible choice instead of positive dog training is horrible and stupidity at its worst. Making a movie like this sends the wrong message to dog parents. I get its a true story with a happy ending BUT There should have been a clear message at the end of the movie saying ""We do not advocate this uninformed treatment of any canine. Please find a good canine trainer to avoid losing your treasured fur member of your family and traumatizing your lost dog having to fend for themselves and barely surviving in the human world.""",/review/rw8802407/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2023,e-66469,10," Waxh the whole movie
",I scrolled through the reviews on this and was disappointed that the 1/10 person didn't even finish the movie and talked about how it took to long to get to the point. GROW SOME PASHENT PANTS. I am 13 and made it through this movie beter than some person who is probably 25 or older. I thought it was a great move especially for dog lovers. Definitely recommend if you have some free time. It is a little sad at some points but definitely is a great tru story. I definitely relate to this story. When you lose your dog all you want to do is find them. I have experienced this with one of my dogs before not to this extent but I have lost a dog for a few hours and it felt like day's.,/review/rw8802407/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,tommy5677,5," I muddled through
","The only reason this review got a 5 is because of Rob Lowe. That's it. Even at the ripe age of 58, this man continues to pack a handsome punch and it's obvious in this movie that he's hitting the gym on a regular basis.",/review/rw8802407/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,domialenic,1," pathetic
","Of course all you dog and animal lovers will have watched this movie. Based o a ""true"" story after all . But it can go beyond the ridiculous which this production certainly did. The sugar will stick with you for a long time. Nothing wrong with a bit of sentimental story telling. But here we have the story of an obviously very privileged family that could afford dedicating themselves 24/24 to finding their family pet, no expenses spared. Nothing really wrong with the premise. But to much is to much. It comes to the stage where one feels uncomfortable with the amount of fakeness and over the top artificial emotionality..",/review/rw8802407/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2023,bonnierae,4," Could have been so much better!
",The storyline is an interesting one--and apparently true. But the acting is clunky and the script even worse. And I love Rob Lowe! He seems at times to be a bit embarrassed at even being in this movie.,/review/rw8802407/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,zaltman_bleros,6," Not enough dog
","It's an enjoyable film that is lacking in the dog department. The dog is lost on the Apalachen (something) Trail and the film focuses on the search for the dog, the relationship with the father and son and the people they meet along the way that help them with flyers and spreading the word about the lost dog. I would have wanted to also see the ordeals of the dog Gronker but alas it was not to be. I also hate it that the trailer was misleading us, thinking the father was not fan of the dog the son brought home when in fact he loved that dog as much as the son. Why do they do that with trailers. Anyway whoopie, I reached the minimum character limit. Dog Gone is a good old feel good family movie. It's fine, just wished to see more dog in it.",/review/rw8802407/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,Jimduffy-51410,7," Emotional Fun
",So I wasn't expecting much from this as it's a Netflix dog movie. I did not know it was a true story until I watched the movie and I really enjoyed this film. You've got some really relatable stuff in there for me when it comes to Fielding not knowing what he wants to do with his life and his relationship with his Dad. The film got me really emotional at times when I wasn't expecting that at all. I thought it would be some cheesy dog movie with bad dialogue. But it was way more fun and heart warming than that. It won't end up being my favourite of the year or anything but it's still fun 7.5/10.,/review/rw8802407/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,danieljfarthing,5," Hallmarkesque tear-jerking true-tale canine melodrama
","In Hallmarkesque true-tale canine melodrama ""Dog Gone"" charmless whiner Johnny Berchtold (the film's worst aspect) returns from college to wealthy parents Rob Lowe (likeable as ever) & Kimberley Williams-Paisley... with new young lab-mix dog Gonkers, who needs meds each month to survive. So when Berchtold loses Gonkers on The Appalachian Trail Williams-Paisley sets up a military-style search command-centre at home while Lowe & Berchtold hit the trail looking for him (and bonding)... and they all spread the word as the clock ticks. Nick Santora's script IS cheesie, but still jerks out the tears just as intended. Watch with Kleenex handy, as like it or not they will be necessary.",/review/rw8802407/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2023,zorroaca,7," I Ejoyed... But Can See Where Others Might Not
",This is more of a personality... family and relationships story than about a dog. In a way... the dog is a backdrop. I am a dog lover and have lost one that was very close to me... so I am a ready made sucker. BUT this film covers about 4 stories... it has good acting... has very good production quality... and good character development. This was an easy film for Rob Lowe... but I think he did a great job. It does pull at the heart strings... and it did get to me a couple of times.... but I don't think it was over done. Most definitely an all family film... rare these days... but I'm a grown man and I enjoyed it. I don't think it's more than a 6... but I gave it a 7 to counterbalance those with a grievance or just a bad heart. And a good 6 is not bad.,/review/rw8802407/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2023,knights69,4," Syrup with extra sugar
","I put this movie on for myself and step daughter as we both love dogs and a good dog story, this movie started out ok but from about 1/2 hour in it just turned to Syrup, the only thing I agree with is him (the over financed son) buying a rescue dog, but the rest is over the top with a massively privileged brat kid with apparently high earning, high executive with contacts everywhere and mom stay at home mom that does everything both father and son want or need, with plenty of time on both there hands apparently, then son/kid who believes his parents will financially and emotionally support him for the rest of his life getting a rescue dog (only tick here)",/review/rw8802407/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,desiredresults,10," Don't listen to knights69
","Unlike knights69 I have the knowledge and empathy for others and found this show to be a great TRUE STORY. I did not see just a privileged brat kid, I found a man that needed more than just a school or parents pushing their wants and believes for him to find the right path for him. I see mom who had her own issue that she pushed on her son. Unlike knight69 I seen the love and compassion, it was something this world needs more of, a lot less nasty horrible attitudes knights69 lives with apparently daily! The times of joy and the sad times brings reality to everything, which this movie this TRUE STORY has.",/review/rw8802407/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,williamdrummer-70508,3," Good Potential, Horrible Execution
","""Dog Gone"" sounded and was advertised as if it was going to be the next big dog movie, much like ""Marley and Me,"" ""Beethoven"" and ""Air Bud."" However, this movie was FAR from those blockbusters. The acting was decent. But that's about it for this one. The writing seemed like it was written by a bunch of middle schoolers, it was predictable, and it just didn't hit me in the feels like the successful dog movies I listed above. The only part I actually enjoyed was the ending. But up until that point, everything was slow, boring, and ""meh"" at best. This one flopped in my book. I think there should've been more scenes with the dog itself to get the audience to form that relationship with the dog first. Once the dog ran off, it was hardly in the movie. There were no cut scenes showing what the dog was up to while it was on the run, and the whole movie was based on them finding the dog. While the story of this is true, the movie failed to impress.",/review/rw8802407/?ref_=tt_urv
