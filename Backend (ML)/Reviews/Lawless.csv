26 January 2013,boblipton,8," Statham Makes a Great Parker
","As a fan of Donald Westlake's writing -- he did the Parker books under the pseudonym of Richard Stark -- I have long been bemused by the inability of film makers to adapt his work for the screen. Westlake wrote for the screen himself, and the Parker books are nothing but action and plot. Yes, there's character, but you figure it out from what Parker and his associates do.",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2013,neil-476,7," Crime thriller which keeps its schizophrenia under control
","Robber with morals Parker (Jason Statham), shot and left for dead, wants only to recover his share and teach people how to behave properly. Having tracked those who owe him money down to Palm Beach, he poses as a Texan businessman in order to get a real estate agent to help him identify the property they may be using as a base. He may not have reckoned with the real estate agent having her own agenda, and the crew who owe him money having high powered connections... ",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2013,ActionFan-Reviews,7," Statham Doing What He Does Best - Kick Ass
","Many people say the same things about Jason Statham, He's a typecast or he doesn't do anything different. Which is partly true, but he is good as an action star and in my opinion hes a better actor than what some say. I don't think he does get enough credit seeing how he got into movies almost by accident. ",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2013,kosmasp,7," Not a love story
","While I wasn't aware there was already a ""Parker"" character (in books that is), I was more drawn to the movie because of the director. Taylor Hackford has done some extraordinary work. Be it ""Officer and Gentleman"", ""Devil's Advocate"" or my personal favorite ""Blood in Blood out"". But you can't compare this to any of those movies of course. I was however surprised seeing him working with Jason Statham. A man more known for his action filled roles.",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2013,siderite,6," I really wanted to like it
","I wanted to like this movie so much, because I really think Jason Statham has some serious acting skills and he deserves some good scripts. Also the story is based on a book, so it should have been good.",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2013,bob-rutzel-1,7," Good Action Thriller
",Parker (Jason Statham) is a thief with codes to live by. He is left for dead by his cohorts in crime when he refuses to join them for another heist. He vows to go after them and get what is his. ,/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2013,brendonm,8," Captures the essence of the ""Parker"" character
","I've read some of Richard Stark (a.k.a. Donald Westlake) 'Parker' books and this movie pretty much captures the essence of the character. This is not Shakespeare folks. The morality is pretty black and white in these books and Taylor Hackford and the screenwriter captures what this character is about very well. The only thing I found awkward in this movie were the flashbacks in the first third -- but that's a screenplay structure issue, not directing issue. Acting-wise, thought everyone did very well with their roles. No, there's not a lot of depth to anyone, except for perhaps Jennifer Lopez's character who makes it clear she's stuck in a dead-end life post-divorce and needs an out. All in all, a very good, entertaining crime thriller. I won't remember this years from now, but it entertained me and kept my attention throughout. And aside from all this, Stratham makes for one good badass! If you like this, definitely check out ""The Bank Job"" that he starred in: he really shows his acting chops in that one.",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2013,george.schmidt,8," Vengeance seeking Statham propels this swell slice of pulp fiction
","PARKER (2013) *** Jason Statham, Jennifer Lopez, Michael Chiklis, Nick Nolte, Wendell Pierce, Clifton Collins, Jr., Bobby Cannavale, Patti LuPone, Carlos Carrasco, Michah Hauptman, Emma Booth. Statham serves well as a revenge seeking crook with a code who is out for vengeance - and his slice of the pie - after a heist of double crosses leaves him for dead. High octane actioner with a swell ensemble and Lopez' best on screen role since ""Out Of Sight"" as the fly-in- the-ointment real estate agent that comes into Statham's plan-of-action-by default. Directed with gumption by vet Taylor Hackford and John C. McLaughlin's crackerjack adaptation of the late, great pulp fiction scribe Donald E. Weslake's novel ""Flashfire"" (under the Richard Stark pseudonym).",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2013,bmennen,8," A 'must see' for Jason Statham fans...
","Well, SURE, there are places where you must suspend disbelief (it's not THAT easy to steal a car, is it?), and SURE there are plot holes, and SURE there are times when you say to yourself ""How did he know to go there?"" BUT...this is one enjoyable movie!",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2013,BeneCumb,7," Too long and predictable, but no flop
","Of course, similar events - revenge after double-crossing - have been depicted several times and will definitely be depicted in the future as well - but it is the direction and choice of actors that counts. As for Parker, everything is at least okay with those: the director Taylor Hackford is an accredited creator and names like Jason Statham, Nick Nolte, Jennifer Lopez are certain signs of quality and non-boredom. They are pleasant to follow even in less interesting and less veracious scenes.",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,CuriosityKilledShawn,4," The Pen Guy
","Parker has existed as a movie character for quite some time now, just never as his proper name. Donald E. Westlake's famous anti-hero has been in many movies ranging from Point Blank (Walker) to Payback (Porter), with a few others in between. And, honestly, you're better off with any one of those as this is a very lazily-produced potboiler.",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2021,Vartiainen,6," Enjoyable
","A Taylor Hackford film, starring Jason Statham and Jennifer Lopez. The story revolves around Statham's character, the eponymous Parker, who's a high level thief, much sought after in the criminal underworld for his cool demeanour and ability to think on his feet. But then a job goes sideways and he's betrayed by his supposed partners in crime. He survives and vows revenge.",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2013,m-atanasoff,3," Every other Jason Statham film ever made
","Parker, a.k.a. ""Every other Jason Statham film ever...but this time with a ten gallon"". I won't be going in a detailed review, because if you've seen one Jason Statham flick you've seen every Jason Statham flick. Don't believe me? Here are some common trends I've noticed across his other films also present in this one: 1. Obligatory scene where he runs away from the hospital, minutes after waking up from being shot, beaten and/or mauled by a bear - check. 2. Semi-anonymous protagonist that is just a ridiculous badass for no apparent reason - check. 3. Whatever dubious activities he takes part in are explained to the viewer as honorable in a ""everyone gets dirty"" kind of way, because you know, JS has a code he adheres to and that automatically makes crime acceptable - check. 4. Women are magnetically compelled to his junk by his mere presence - check. Fast and fancy cars, because. (No I didn't forget the rest of the sentence) - check. 5.Walking around seemingly unfazed with broken appendages, ribs, collar bones, multiple gunshot wounds, knife stabbing wounds and/or bear mace - check.",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2014,namashi_1,7," Kick-Ass!
","Adapted from Flashfire, the 19th Parker novel, written by Donald Westlake under the name Richard Stark, 'Parker' succeeds by arresting it viewer effectively. A Kick-Ass Action Crime-Thriller, that doesn't lack the bite!",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2017,Tweekums,7," A solid Jason Statham crime thriller
","Parker is a thief with his own moral code; he won't rob from those who can't afford it and he won't hurt anybody unless he thinks they deserve it he also does what he says he will do and expects the same of others. His father in law sets him up with a reputable crew to rob the Ohio State Fair; things don't quite go according to plan and afterwards this crew tell Parker that they intend to use their million dollar haul to fund their next job. Parker wants out so they shoot him and leave him for dead. Of course he isn't dead and he is soon on their trail; he intends to find them, wait for them to do their robbery then take their spoils before killing them. This takes him to Palm Beach, Florida, where he poses as a wealthy Texan looking to buy property. Estate agent Leslie Rodgers shows him a variety of properties including some that have recently sold one particularly interests him and sure enough it is the one the gang are using as their base. When it becomes clear that Parker is alive the gang's mob connections send a killer to deal with him.",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2013,cinematic_aficionado,6," Mediocre with some pluses.

1 February 2013,pixrox1,8," ""Nothing but bills . . .""
",". . . is the funniest line in a movie that has more than a few. Delivered by Jennifer Lopez as a struggling Boca Raton, FL, realtor in the second of three postscripts to the main story, it reflects the matter-of-fact tone tinged with a touch of irony that pervades director Taylor Hackford's screen version of the Richard Stark novel Flashfire. Unlike, say the recent Schwarzenegger vehicle THE LAST STAND, Parker is NOT a movie which defies common sense from the get-go. Parker is not a cartoon (except for the implausible number of injuries the title character played by Jason Statham is able to bounce back from in the span of 2 hours; but given the level of abuse his character took in CRANK #1 & #2, Parker is at least a little more convincing). Parker's mentor Nick Nolte and his ad hoc partner Leslie (played by Lopez) are on-screen just enough to balance Parker's character with a check here and there, but not too much. Ditto Emma Booth as Parker's lover (and frequent nurse) Claire. The opening set piece filmed at the Ohio State Fair is more fun, perhaps, than the later jewel auction heist, but at least neither scene has viewers cringing for the safety of an aged retired California governor. Two thumbs up!",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2013,caseymoviemania,4," Casey's Movie Mania: PARKER (2013)
","Terribly clunky and painfully routine, Taylor Hackford's big screen adaptation of the late novelist's Donald E. Westlake's PARKER (who died in 2008) is nothing more than your typical, undemanding Jason Statham-centric crime thriller.",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2013,blanbrn,8," A lot of action, yet the story is to good to be true, still good eye candy in the form of J. Lo!
","""Parker"" is one of those action movies that you watch and feel entertained it's a crowd pleaser with a happy ending as everything ends in a way that's all most to good to be true like the anti hero Parker(Statham)getting revenge and getting money and splitting it with a woman Leslie(Jennifer Lopez) who needs it! Anyway Jason Statham is Parker a thief who after getting double crossed by his crew of bad guys goes off and assumes his own new identity and he relocates and meets and has a friendship with an unlikely woman named Leslie Rodgers(Jennifer Lopez). The meeting and new travel takes place in sunny south Florida and Ms. Rodgers is a desperate little lady divorced and living at home with her soap opera addicted mother, her only love is her job as a Realtor and selling rich real estate thru out Palm Beach and Miami. Her meeting with Parker despite dangerous and cautious will lead her to a rich bank account! Most liked and remembered is the eye candy scene of Lopez's Rodgers character stripping down to a sexy silk black bra and panties with white polka dots! Wow Jennifer is one sexy lady. Overall good action film with a happy ending that's blended with sex appeal.",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2013,dgefroh,8," Parker delivers action-entertainment-fun
","If you enjoy action movies, tough guys, an engaging plot, and decent acting, this one more than fills the bill. Going into this one I was somewhat apprehensive as Jason Statham movies miss more than they hit, and when you throw Jennifer Lopez in, I was really quite leery and afraid this one was going to be stupid and a typical Statham slam-fest....WRONG!! I've got to give it to both Lopez and Statham for pulling off not only a entertaining movie, but for also doing really quit a good job of selling their respective roles. The storyline has been done before, but there are enough twists and turns in this movie to keep it fresh and not totally predictable. My suggestion for you is if this type of movie is your thing, then don't miss this one.",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2019,valadas,6," Good performance
",That's the best part of this movie. All the actors and actresses do an excellent job with a particular mention of Jason Statham as Parker the main character. The story itself is nor very interesting nor very thrilling. The simple plot of a man who despite being a professional thief has got his ethics and soon enters into conflict with his gang partners after a successful heist. This leads to him being beaten and shot by them who leave him on the field almost dying on a field by a road where a passing by family lifts him up and takes him to hospital from where he runs away soon after being conscious again (we doubt how a so badly wounded man can recover so quickly but there is no explanation for that in the movie). Then the rest of the movie shows his actions to meet the other guys in order to take his revenge. Meanwhile he meets a girl who helps him about his purpose. And that is all.,/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2013,Ed-Shullivan,8," Class guy that Parker!
","Jason Statham puts in another great performance. He is a kick-ass thief, and he can be your best friend, or your worst enemy for life. Parker maintains strong principles. His life motto is to ""keep your commitments"".",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2013,searchanddestroy-1,," I expected the worst and I was damn' wrong
","I am a Richard Stark's novels die hard fan since the 70's. I started reading them at 12 years old. Parker is one of may all novels favourite. I have seen all the movies adapted from this gruesome, hard boiled professional robber's tales. Of course, Lee Marvin is the best above all, and the first too...",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2015,juneebuggy,8," Decent revenge thriller for Statham fans
","This was pretty good, especially if you're a Jason Statham fan and just sit back and enjoy the ride. It was actually better than I was expecting in some respects since I wasn't to keen on the whole Jennifer Lopez aspect going in but she plays a desperate, past her prime sort of character and thankfully not a love interest, so that worked for me.",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2014,A_Different_Drummer,7," Interesting Movie ... but nothing to do with Parker
","A long time ago in a place far away (the 60s) there was a bestselling writer of thrillers who was at the top of his craft. But that was not enough for this writer, he had a secret urge to write a different kind of novel, a kind that really had been seen since the 1940s. Dark. Fast. Efficient. Lacking any moral center. And he did, using a pen name. ""Richard Stark."" They were called the Parker novels and they are considered today the best of their kind ever done. Even other writers go nuts for these. Then Hollywood came knocking. Attempting (repeat, attempting) to bring the essence of Parker to the screen, some 6 times so far. And succeeding -- maybe -- twice. The Lee Marvin and Mel Gibson versions were not half bad. Which brings us to the 2013 attempt. Yuck. You would almost suspect that the reason they chose a one-word title - ""PARKER"" -- is that, without the title, most people would not know or suspect the connection to the above-mentioned series. As a thriller, it is weak, boring, derivative and barely useful for cable. As a Parker entry, it is a bad joke. As a pre-audition by Jennifer Lopez (the older, slimmed-down version) to get the lead in a future biopic of the Natalie Wood Story, it is however compelling.",/review/rw2935186/?ref_=tt_urv
