24 September 2005,MinorityReporter,7," Slightly better than the first
",I believe that the general consensus is that the first Austin Powers movie is the best of the bunch. I happen to disagree (as you can probably tell from my one-line-summary). I feel that the second film actually improves on the first film by adding a few new characters and generally cutting loose on the humor making it even more bizarre and funny than in the first film. I don't expect people to agree but at least hear me out as to why I think the second film is better.,/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2000,mic check,7," Mr. Mojo rising
","Austin Powers is one of those movies that has become MORE popular as time wears on. Austin's slang has worked its way into the lexicon and everything from the redhot video to the Austin Powers Penis Enlarger is on sale and raking in meeeeeelions. When news of a sequel hit the streets, fans freaked. It's safe to say that AP2 is rivaled only by The Phantom Menace as 1999's must see.",/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2002,Smells_Like_Cheese,9," Yeah, Baby!!! This is one of the funniest friggin' movies of all time
","I know it sounds silly, but I just think this is one of the funniest movies I had ever seen. Maybe I was just in a good mood or something, but I was a little surprised by the rating of just 6.5 because I knew a lot of people who enjoyed the movie as well as I did.",/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2004,Cephyran,8," Recycles old humor, but still fun...
","The Spy who Shagged Me - not a title you'd expect to garner much respect, but this movie does okay. With Austin Powers 2 we see the arrival of such characters as Mini-Me and Fat Bastard, who inevitably help steer the sequel way from completely recycling every joke used in the first film. However, there is still that overlap, so a lot of the humor comes off a bit stale and tacky. There is virtually no end to the plot holes, inconsistencies, and various irregularities, but that is often a big part of the humor of the Austin Powers movies - making direct fun of the spy genre, as well as themselves.",/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2000,Xophianic,8," Better than the first one!
","Some people don't think AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY was worthy of a sequel. Some think there should be a large series of AUSTIN POWERS movies, like the infamous Bond movies. Trust me, I'm kinda sick of everyone doing impressions of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil, (and I do one fine Dr. Evil if I do say so myself, even though both are easy to impersonate), but I thought AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME was even better than the first one. So if you asked me if there should be a series of AUSTIN POWERS movies, and I wasn't so sick of all those impersonations, I might say ""Yeah baby!""",/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2007,KUAlum26,8," More inevitable cheekiness from Myers
","The follow-up to 1997's Austin Powers:International Man of Mystery was probably not a certainty form the get-go:if I recall correctly,the first Austin Powers was NOT the smashing success of a box-office film that many involved initially imagined,and had it not been for a strong reaction from video and DVD renters,the franchise may've stopped at one. Since I happened to enjoy the first one(saw it on video BTW),I can honestly say that while the sequels seemed to have depreciating value,I'm still glad that Myers and company went ahead with the follow-ups.",/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 1999,Coxer99,," Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me
","Hilarious return to the international man of mystery with this non stop laugh ride of a film with Myers doing it again as Austin, Dr. Evil and a new character named Fat Bastard. There are many funny moments in the film especially the Scott/Dr. Evil episode of Jerry Springer and the emergence of Mini-Me, perfectly played by Verne Troyer. The laughs are constant. You'll laugh so hard, you'll have a headache when you leave the theater.",/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2019,dockerykelli,10," A WONDERFUL SEQUEL
","The first Austin Powers fell flat for me, however, the sequel WAS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!! It's has the same exact cast as the first one along with additional new characters!!! It's HILARIOUS, love blossoming and lightly action packed!!! A+++ Film.",/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv

20 October 2007,slokes,6," The Man With The Golden Pun
","The first Austin Powers movie was a shot-in-the-dark comedy Michael Myers pretty much made for himself and a few friends, little imagining the fuss it would spawn. This time, Myers and his alter egos set out to build a middle-brow entertainment franchise. At least they got the money part right.",/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2019,johnnythegreaserboy,7," A Hilarious Time-Waster
","Picture this: you're home with your friends or family and you have to pick a film. Nothing's really looking good and you just want to stick something on to have a good laugh. Here comes, the Austin Powers trilogy! Out of the three films, this one is one of the funnier instalments. Mike Myers gives a great performance as always, and Rob Lowe gives a great performance (although a very short one). I love the British 60's vibe, since I'm a big vintage fan. It's a good film to put on when you're having a bad day and just need a laugh. No wonder Austin Powers is such an icon nowadays!",/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2002,DunnDeeDaGreat,10," One of the funniest sequels ever made
",Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is a great follow up to Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery . In some senses the film is better the original. Meyers is funnier this time around as Doctor Evil with his one-liners and Verne Troyer is great and steals almost all the scenes as Mini-Me as does Seth Green. A great sequel if you've never sene it you're in for a treat.,/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2006,ccthemovieman-1,8," Funny But Nasty 'R-Rated' Look At The Stupid '60s
","I get a perverse kick out of the other deliberately-stupid humor of these ""Austin Powers"" movies. They are extremely bright and colorful - photography- wise, but full of dark comedy moments as well as light-hearted slapstick. Best of all, they poke fun at the ludicrous 1960s lifestyle, particularly in England. Many people may think they glorifying the hedonism of the period, and maybe that's the case, but find it more of a satire and see it that way.",/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2020,masonsaul,8," Superior sequel
","While it suffers from a few of the problems most sequels do, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is the rare superior sequel. Mike Myers is fantastic in all of his roles. Heather Graham, Seth Green and Verne Troyer are all great. It's way funnier than it's predecessor with more consistently funny jokes. Jay Roach's direction is also great, it's well filmed and extremely well paced. The soundtrack and the music by George S. Clinton are both good.",/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2006,lee_eisenberg,7," mostly good, but one scene was unnecessary
","""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" was mostly really funny - with Austin continuing his face-off with Dr. Evil - but the stool sample scene was unnecessary. Still, the rest of the movie was a hoot, especially all the slang names for the spaceship. Some of the things in these movies, I wonder how they're able to come up with, especially some of Mini-Me's gags. All in all, it's a movie that you're sure to love, particularly with the Jerry Springer scene and all the associations with world events.",/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2003,Silverzero,4," An inferior sequel, more successful, but lacking the dry wit of its predecessor.
",POSSIBLE SPOILERS,/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2010,TheLittleSongbird,8," ""Do you smoke after sex?"" ""I don't know. I've never looked""
","The plot once again is daft and while Heather Graham is really pretty she isn't quite in the same league as Elizabeth Hurley. That said, it is a fun, witty and sophisticated ""shagadelic"" sequel, that is literally like a lava-lamp lampoon that is stupid and as sophisticated as the first film. It isn't as good as a film to the first, but I think where it is improved from its predecessor is that it is more relaxed in style. Once again, the sets and costumes are gorgeous to look at, the soundtrack is funky and takes you back to the period and there are many moments of sparkling wit in the script. The film also moves quickly while being more relaxed at the same time. The performances from Mike Myers, Michael York and Rob Lowe are top notch too. Overall, a tad inferior, but a fun sequel nonetheless. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2002,bob the moo,," Still funny but a lot of recycled gags from the first film
","Happily married to Felicity and with Dr Evil gone, Austin settles into the future.  However when a fiendish plot to kill Powers fails it is clear that Dr Evil is back.  In order to tackle Powers, Dr Evil has invented a time tunnel to go back in time to when Powers was frozen and steal his mojo. Powers must also join the time jumping to reclaim his mojo in order to beat Dr Evil.",/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 1999,SRVHS,10," It's shagadelic baby
","This is one great movie. To me, to make a good comedy movie you need to make it very funny, and have a cast of lovable zany characters. If you have all that then you got a great comedic movie on your hands.",/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2003,MovieAddict2016,7," ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" is light-hearted entertainment which supplied me with a ton of laughs!

18 June 1999,Dave Taylor,1," What a huge disappointment...
","Same characters and same lines as the first one only it was done poorly. Mike Myers is so much better than this tripe. Dr. Evil is now an all-out pop icon. He has lost all his charm from Austin I. In the first film, Dr. Evil walked that precarious line between madman and culturally hip wannabe. Now, he is just boring. There was nothing innovative about this picture.",/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2005,moonspinner55,4," Cartoony smut goes a bit limp...
","Follow-up to 1997's ""Austin Powers International Man Of Mystery"" has Dr. Evil back from space, using a time-machine to travel back to 1969 in hopes of finishing off super-spy Austin Powers for good. Colorful but extremely thin comedy spoofs everything '60s (from ""Barbarella"" to ""The Thomas Crown Affair""); while these are endearing targets, the film has more dead space than hilarity, and the barest minimum of a plot. The first film was all about building the character of Austin Powers; he was fun, and the slapstick surrounding him was affectionate and happy. This sequel is just an excuse for Mike Myers (in three roles) to cut up; the character of Austin is no longer explored as much as he is exploited. As Fat Bastard, Myers is terrifically, grossly hilarious, but Dr. Evil is already starting to wear out his welcome. The movie is just a lightweight doodle, entertaining enough yet a big step down from its predecessor. ** from ****",/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv

14 June 1999,thad-9,1," Lame, baby lame.
","Same joke, different movie.  How exciting.  I have no idea why I watched this movie, and I suspect that I never will.  Perhaps it was sheer boredom, or that good old attention span problem that all American's have.  Take it from me, don't watch this movie, because you'll just wake up the next day and realize how stupid you were for wasting $7.50 on such a piece of garbage.",/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2007,Aaron1375,9," Another funny entry in the series, actually my favorite.
","Yes, I am sure most people probably prefer the first one over this one, but I thought this was the most funny one of the series. To me, this time both Dr. Evil and Austin are equally funny, unlike part one where Dr. Evil to me was clearly the more funny. The jokes run the gambit from clever to just disgusting bathroom humor...but for the most part they are hits. In this installment Austin is on his honeymoon and his new wife is explained away in rather humorous fashion, though that is a bit of a shame seeing how Elizabeth Hurley was the best Austin girl in the series. Well Austin does a dance number and then during a trist with a Russian spy loses his mojo. Well actually it is stolen by a minion of Dr. Evil named fat bastard. Well you know the drill, Dr. Evil along with his army of villains including the new mini me are going to hold the world ransom for a very high price. Well, Austin is off with a new female agent a very attractive, but not as good actress Heather Graham. Well you have more elaborate death traps, a death ray to destroy the world, Austin battling the all powerful Mini me, and a part of the movie Independence Day. So prepare to laugh as you get to see various jokes on Bond too, the most prominent being the coming out of water scene from Dr. No.",/review/rw1695710/?ref_=tt_urv
