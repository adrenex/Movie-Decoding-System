4 April 2021,johannes2000-1,7," Intriguing, but could have been better.
","I was highly intrigued by season 1, due to the sinister and menacing atmosphere and the weird goings-on, that became more and more unfathomable with every new episode. Unfortunately even the last episode of season 1 didn't deliver any solutions, leaving me puzzled and a bit disappointed. This in spite of all the positive things to praise, like some fine acting, especially by Sissy Spacek and by Bill Skarsgård, the latter playing the pivotal, intangible Kid from... well, from hell, heaven or maybe from nowhere. So I placed my hopes for answers on the second season.",/review/rw4331480/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2019,stevedownsrph-50085,7," Train came off track
","Loved 1st season and the 1st 7 or so episodes of season 2. It really went downhill by the last 3 episodes, the finale was like we are waiting for a large suspenseful ending that never really came. Worth watching but tried too hard to tie into the 1st season by the ending of season 2.",/review/rw4331480/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2018,sarnew35,8," Give it a chance
","I wasn't going to write a review, but after seeing the majority of people giving this 5 stars or less, I felt like I had to. Preface - I am not an avid reader of King's books, but I appreciate the films I have seen. This show was well written, acted, and had really beautiful cinematic moments. And yes - it's confusing, but it all gets explained in episode 9 and 10. Now, if you're not a fan of mystery or supernatural-ish/alternate realities, this is not for you. And if you want an answer to something right away, forget it. In my opinion, I disagree with those stating that it's poorly paced, slow, boring and written badly. There is a reason why the show flows the way it does. It kept my attention the entire time, so much so, that I didn't ever look at my phone (that's saying a lot).",/review/rw4331480/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2018,plasticanimalz,5," Had An Intriguing Start But Goes Nowhere Interesting
","First of all, I do not get the impression the two creators of the show ever read a Stephen King book other than the synopsis on the back of some of his books. There is little elements of Stephen King in here or his books, other than keeping the names of certain buildings, and off-handedly mentioning things, here and there. I feel like the creators sold the idea on the interesting concept explored in the first episodes...but had no idea where it was going beyond that. It shows. You're intrigued at first and follow along despite the show being slow, because Bill Skarsgard is just so creepy, weird, and intriguing, and Sissy Spacek is great, and you feel like it's going somewhere...but then you realize, maybe it's not...and then eventually you don't care where it's going because it just seems like a ship adrift that doesn't know where it's going either.",/review/rw4331480/?ref_=tt_urv

26 July 2018,mf2812,10," Believe The Hype
","As a lifelong Stephen King fan, I've been awaiting this for an age it seems. Only 3 episodes in but it has a real ""King vibe"" about it. The nods to various works by the man are plentiful, and the cinematography seems plucked from a King fans mind. Cannot wait for the next episodes to drop. If you're reading this and still not sure whether to give it a go as many King adaptations are a hit or a miss I urge you to watch. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",/review/rw4331480/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2020,SnoopyStyle,7," intriguing
","The recently dissolved rundown town of Castle Rock, Maine is controlled by the Shawshank State Prison. It's the town's main employer. The warden commits suicide and the new warden Porter reopens an abandoned wing of the prison. Guard Dennis Zalewski finds a mystery prisoner (Bill Skarsgård) locked in a bunker who refuses to give his name and only says Henry Matthew Deaver. Henry Matthew Deaver (André Holland) is a defense lawyer in Texas. He returns to Castle Rock after Dennis calls him and takes up the mystery boy's case. His adoptive mother Ruth Deaver (Sissy Spacek) suffers from dementia and he's wrongly suspected in the death of his adoptive father. Alan Pangborn (Scott Glenn) is the former sheriff who has been living with Ruth. Henry's childhood neighbor friend Molly Strand (Melanie Lynskey) suffers from her own mental issues and takes illicit drugs to alleviate the symptoms. She intents on using her inheritance to renew the town. In the second season, nurse Annie Wilkes (Lizzy Caplan) is on the run with her daughter Joy (Elsie Fisher) and they arrive in Castle Rock. Pop Merrill (Tim Robbins) is the head of his crime family and adoptive father to Somali siblings, Abdi Omar and Dr. Nadia Omar.",/review/rw4331480/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2018,tdwillis-26273,9," I Couldn't Even Blink
","They often say it takes a team to make anything succesfull and it is evident here. The actors are top notch, best of the best. The directing is A+. The camera work and cinematography are excellent. The story line and plot are at once a slow burn, yet sufficiently creepy and intellegent to keep you glued. One reviewer suggested they feel asleep it was so boring. He must have had a hard day at work, or narcolepsy because I dont think I even blinked.",/review/rw4331480/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2019,donaldricco,5," Not as advertised.
","Overall, it was a disappointment. I felt like it was advertised to be a piece that was going to connect a lot of the Castle Rock stories, and even the title sequence references that idea. But this is a stand alone story, that mentions places and familiar names in Castle Rock, but doesn't connect anything. Sure, there is good ol' Shawshank and the Mellow Tiger, and you have Jackie Torrance and Sheriff Pangborn and several references to Cujo, but that's all they are - references. As a long time Stephen King fan, I was looking for so much more.",/review/rw4331480/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2018,slider9499,5," No clue on what is happening
","After six episodes, I still have no idea what is going on. The first episode was good, then it started it's slow roll downhill. I don't care about any of the characters except the somewhat psychic neighbor. Lots of hype. Unfortunately doesn't nearly live up to it or what was expected.",/review/rw4331480/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2018,Matt345,," Brooding, with a sense of doom, without much meaning
","Stephen King isn't my favourite kind of writer, even for adaptations, however one could expect original material by him to have at least some kind of recognizable, coherent structure. This feels distinctly different even to someone with only passing knowledge of Stephen King stories, as it is clearly not an original.
This series is full of a sense brooding and doom, however without any coherence or anything to justify one's interest, instead it does what is the norm nowadays in TV writing: it simply assumes one's interest, takes it for granted, because watching stuff is practically a civil duty nowadays. What one is fed then is merely a pastiche of vague thematic references to Stephen King stories.",/review/rw4331480/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2018,mattenglish,7," Unclear ending

30 August 2018,rrrudra,4," I just updated my rating from 6 stars to 4 stars
","Started off well,i was totally excited for the show just to witness the brilliance of stephen king. It was hard at first to catch up with the story and predict the upcoming events, i was impressed by the fact that they managed to keep the plot so obscured till the 5th episode,then came the 6th episode and i was still patient, waiting for them disclose at least something that would encourage us to continue with show.Now after the 8th episode i am absolutely certain that this series is a fiasco, scattered sequences rendered into 10 episodes which lead to multiple plot-holes. Some cringy scenes which i ignored at first are also coming to my attention right now.",/review/rw4331480/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2018,decspv,4," Nonsensical
","After episode 7, still with few hopes left that something will rescue Castle Rock, I came to total boredom and final exhaustion. Four stars just for the set and some good acting, that's it. It has no meaning, no hooks, no intelligible development. I understand one must watch few episodes until things start to clarify but in this case, with each episode, more confusion is added, less clarity, and tons of nonsense keeps piling up.
The expectation wears out, one gets tired of constant background suspense music and darkness. I even had to add close captioning because the actors kept mumbling things. No, I don't care if the great Stephen King is behind the idea. It is crappola. Bye bye Castle Rock.",/review/rw4331480/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2020,westsideschl,9," Season 2: Lizzy - Stay Away!
","Usual caverns w/ancient bodies & symbols on walls. Usual insects (beetles) as harbingers of evil. The insects know! Undead with the help of ancient evil spirits take over bodies & haunt the town. Interesting sub-plot of using a Somali community.
Would have rated this as well done, but done before script. However, Lizzy Caplan as a bipolar, autistic spectrum, schizophrenic all rolled into one Annie (no disrespect meant to those who have to live w/those disorders) was creepily phenomenal. The looks, the walk, the range of emotions so disturbing that Anthony Hopkins & Kathy Bates combined would be a tame little ducky compared to her. Lizzy was so creepy that, even as an actress, please don't move into my neighborhood. Wait, expand that to city. She's deserving of an award for her performance.",/review/rw4331480/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2020,niseynisey,9," Patience is rewarded!
",Woooow. I listened to the other reviewers and gave this show a chance and MAN did it pay off in the end. My mind is so blown by season 1 episode 9 that I just want to stop here and watch it all over again. There were soooo many clues! I sort of guessed the twist but not to this extent!! Definitely give this one a chance; Pay attention & be patient.,/review/rw4331480/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2020,DrProfessor,8," A misguideded cancelation.
","I loved this show. And with 'The Stand', coming to TV (and with yet another Skarsgård), you'd think with an 88% approval rating on RT, Hulu would be interested enough to produce a season 3. But it's never about us viewers, it's always about the bottom line.",/review/rw4331480/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2019,westsideschl,9," The Usual
","There's something off-putting about flowing red dyed corn syrup for blood that is cheap and usually portends more future production cheap.
Hoping for originality, anyway, too many redundant plot, set, scene King seen before hooks, such as:
1. Reusing the same old suspenseful background sound effects. And, the always present oldies music.
2. Same old background figures disappearing; are they there or not there? Same old suicides, murders.
3. Usual nor'eastern small town w/questionable characters & malignant history as our setting. Must be the water.
4. Usual woods w/usual voices & sounds, and creepy old houses.
5. Shawshank prison was certainly familiar. Note: DVD subtitle spelled out ""prisonerer"". Final scene of locked up prisoner in total darkness. How does he eat? Then why were lights later left on? Not sure if this was a clue or a mistake, but one of the cemetery markers has a death in mid Feb. 2019, a couple of weeks from now.
6. How can I miss the crows/ravens, and their familiar dying crashes into windows, etc.
7. The voice/mind reading character, Molly, besides not being believable didn't seem to fit the storyline. Overall unless you are taking lecture detailed notes all along the timelines, and characters (alive or dead or imaginary or another dimension) are going to meld into a jumbled mess.
Left enough confusion room for season 2, of course.",/review/rw4331480/?ref_=tt_urv

21 May 2021,kevin_robbins,10," This is very well done with great writing and cinematography. I strongly recommend it.
","We finally wrapped up Season 2 of Castle Rock which does a brilliant job of showcasing the talents of both Stephen King and JJ Abrams. The storyline, primary and subplots are all very intricate and perfectly woven together. It even does a great job of tying season 1 & 2 together while delivering a completely unique and unrelated storyline. I have to say for a Stephen King authored tale, this ending is very fulfilling and well done. I do think season 1 was a touch better (10/10) than season 2, so I'd give this a 8/10 (Jaz gave season 1 10/10 and season 2 9/10). Either way, this is very well done with great writing and cinematography. I strongly recommend it.",/review/rw4331480/?ref_=tt_urv
