7 September 1999,TxMike,," From start to finish, never a dull moment. A fine, entertaining movie!
","Hopkins, Banderas, and Zeta-Jones are all just perfect in this film. From the action-packed opening scene to the rip-roaring climax near the end, this is a movie to just sit back and enjoy. It avoids taking itself too seriously, with more comedy than pathos. There is action, love, heartbreak, deception, redemption, and back to love. In several different ways. Sword fights, gun fights, dancing, horse chases, explosions. This movie has it all. I saw it on DVD and it comes across beautifully. ",/review/rw3041814/?ref_=tt_urv

6 March 2020,MR-ODIN,," Zorro
","Entertaining and dashing, The Mask Of Zorro is a superb action film. Antonio Banderas gives the greatest performance of his career as Zorro. A thrilling action packed film, The Mask Of Zorro is a superbly crafted action film that is entertaining and thrilling throughout. The film is never boring and delivers terrific action. The acting is terrific as well, and the cast alongside Banderas is great. Anthony Hopkins stars as the original Zorro who takes an apprentice under his wing to exact revenge on the man who imprisioned him and took away his daughter.I have to admit, I never really was a big fan of the Zorro character, but after seeing this film I was blown away. The best way to describe this film is an action packed period piece. The story is engaging enough to keep the viewer entertained and thrilled. I viewed this film quit a few times since its initial release and it doesn't seem dated one bit. The film is just as good now as it was when first released. The Mask Of Zorro remains Antonio Banderas' best performance and he give his all on screen. He is the perfect choice to play Zorro. The film may be uneven, but it succeeds on many levels. A highly entertaining action packed adventure that hits the right notes. Even if it has imperfections, there are more high points than low points. An entertaining film that actually makes Zorro an interesting action hero again.",/review/rw3041814/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2004,Boba_Fett1138,8," Good entertainment!
","Martin Campbell sure knows how to make entertaining movies. After making ""No Escape"" and ""GoldenEye"" he brings us yet another entertaining movie; ""The Mask of Zorro"". He actually used to be one of my favorite directors after seeing those movies I just named but unfortunately he hasn't made anything good lately. Let's hope this change after completing ""Zorro 2"" that is currently being made.",/review/rw3041814/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,8," Splendid swashbuckling entertainment!
","I will not deny that I am not particularly into swashbucklers that much, but I will be prepared to say that the Mask of Zorro is splendid entertainment. Antonio Banderas gives a very spirited performance as Alejandro, and the well-choreographed sword fights, beautiful score and witty screenplay allow Banderas to do what he does best. Anthony Hopkins is perfect as Don Diego, giving his character a sense of bitterness, sensitivity and vulnerability that make all his performances so endearing. In fact, this, Silence of the Lambs and The Elephant Man just go to show what a great actor Hopkins is; the only film he disappoints in is in Chaplin, where he played the rather unnecessary role of the fictional autobiographer. Catherine Zeta Jones is lovely beyond words as Elena, and Stuart Wilson plays his his-sable villain almost to perfection, but Matt Letscher as Captain Love isn't quite as threatening as he should be. The cinematography is very handsome, capturing perfectly the beautiful sets and costumes. The only other criticism I have of the movie, is its length, it's quite excessive. But I will say the explosive finale and spirited performances more than compensate, making it a very well-done and entertaining film. I wasn't as impressed with the sequel, the swordplay was more like slapstick and the plot was less involving and a little bloated. 8/10 for Mask of Zorro though.

13 February 2010,ma-cortes,7," Exquisite adventure with horse action, fencing duels and swashbuckling
","Antonio Banderas is appropriately magnificent along with gorgeous heroine Catherine Zeta-Jones.This superior Zorro with great swordplay is a lavish swashbuckler starred by Anthony Hopkins and Antonio Banderas as the dashing masked avengers . A young Banderas dons a black outfit and becomes the ideal Zorro riding in the hoofprints continuing in the wake of the old Zorro-Hopkins who passes his mantle of protector of hapless ad unfortunates. This is a zesty recounting of saga of legendary masked rider , though not as distinctive as previous classic entry starred by Tyrone Power. Here Zorro faces danger from governor Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson) as well as corrupt villain captain Harrison (Matt Letscher). And Anthony Hopkins gives slickness and distinction as elegant veteran Zorro. After numerous setbacks the hero and his lovely heroine, a wonderful Catherine Zeta-Jones, help the good people of California thwart the greedy schemes of a meanie who stands in the way of statehood for the territory. The nimble actor Banderas runs and jumps all over the images of this movie, as he deals with the oppressor with a breathtaking finale and wreak havoc included.",/review/rw3041814/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2003,rbverhoef,8," A fine action hero
","Zorro is one of my favorite heroes. He looks quite cool and not stupid, weird or childish like Batman, Superman, Spider-Man and all of their villains (except The Joker) and he has no superpowers like them, although sometimes it seems that gravity does not really apply to him. His weapon of choice guarantees some spectacular sword fighting scenes as well.",/review/rw3041814/?ref_=tt_urv

13 August 1999,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,8," Explosive,thought out hollywood adventure.
","The best thing about this movie is the casting.How ingenius,eh? Antonio Banderas as Zorro,eh?And Stuart Wilson as the central villain.This guy is one of the most unrecognised talents around.As a snidy British baddie,he could easily give your average Dennis Hopper a run for his money.Catherine Zeta Jones is also marvellous as the love interest. The action scenes and stunts are fantastic.Real hollywood at it's best.Martin Campbell keeps an efficent and steady pace to proceedings as director. If there's a problem here,it's that it's probably a tad overlong.But luckily,this unwantern time is'nt filled with unnecessary scenes but scenes as visually exciting as the last. It's also marvellous that it's a PG,because such past fare,like Bad Boys,is loud,action packed,exciting and brilliant,it's also rather flatulent and rude.This is just superb action entertainment which can be enjoyed by the whole family.",/review/rw3041814/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2002,tfrizzell,," The Best ""Zorro"" Ever Produced.
","Strikingly entertaining and first-rate in most all cinematic categories, ""The Mask of Zorro"" is a smart action film that works due to a convincing titled character (Antonio Banderas), the almost unreal beauty of Catherine Zeta-Jones and the professionalism of Anthony Hopkins. Anthony Hopkins starts out as Zorro, but is caught by the evil Stuart Wilson shortly after a wild rescue of three men in the village. Wilson leaves the country and takes Hopkins' baby daughter with him. Fast-forward 20 years and Hopkins has escaped and he begins to teach Banderas (also seeking revenge after the murder of his brother) the way to be a fighter for truth and justice. The baby has grown up to become Zeta-Jones and thinks that she is really Wilson's daughter. A great film that works well due to an adequate screenplay, good characterization and solid direction. A near-perfect success. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",/review/rw3041814/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2004,perfectbond,8," Great romance and adventure
","I remember of all the summer movies of 1998 (Armageddon, Deep Impact, Lethal Weapon IV etc.), I enjoyed this one the most. Sure a few liberties with plausibility might have been taken but the overall experience was very enjoyable. There was a sense of pioneering, honor, romance, and loyalty about the characters that made the viewing experience all the more immersive. Director Martin Campbell (Goldeneye, Vertical Limit) staged some exciting action sequences and was lucky to have a talented cast to make considerably more out of what could have been stock characters. Oh, and Banderas (in his best Hollywood role) and Zeta-Jones have great chemistry, a fact that is especially notable in their memorable dance together. All in all, very good escapist entertainment, 9/10.",/review/rw3041814/?ref_=tt_urv

","When deciding to go and watch a movie at the cinema,I have always found,that whilst I remember a lot about the film itself,I most of the time rarely remember much about the surroundings that I watched the movie in.In the middle of 1998,I somehow noticed a mistake,which actually played to my advantage,when I opened the case of a recently brought second hand video,and discovered that instead of the film itself being inside,the contents of the case was a ""blank"" Video.Seeing that I would have to wait for at least a week until the market was on again,I decided to play the ""blank"" Video,and quickly discovered that it contained a program shown on an obscure Sky TV channel in the early 90's called ""Zorro"".",/review/rw3041814/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2012,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,10," Spectacular Film of Excitement
","Not many films start off with an interesting introduction. However, director Martin Campbell did a great job at bringing a new Zorro to take over the old aging Zorro. The way the characters act, the time that is put into making Zorro is done meticulously and it shows. It's great to see how everything in the plot starts out simple and then becomes more complex. Once the complex situations start to arise, the execution of it is beautiful.",/review/rw3041814/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2006,JamesHitchcock,7," The Modern Errol Flynn
","The story of the Californian hero Zorro has much in common with the legend of Robin Hood. Both Diego de la Vega and Robert of Locksley are aristocrats, but both choose to side with the common people in their fight against injustice and oppression by foreign overlords, be they the Norman conquerors of England or the Spanish colonial rulers of California. Both men, at least in the cinematic versions of the legend, are expert swordsmen. Traditionally, of course, Robin Hood was more associated with the longbow than the sword, but the producers of adventure movies have always known that sword-fights make for exciting cinema. Hence the famous duel between Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (or, for that matter, all those light-sabres in ""Star Wars""). Similarly, Zorro still clings to his trusty blade, even though the stories are set at a time in the nineteenth century when serious differences were settled by the gun and swords were largely confined to ceremonial uses and ritualistic duelling.",/review/rw3041814/?ref_=tt_urv

","I just finished watching The Mask Of Zorro, and it was a spectacular achievement. It all seemed cliched at first, and even though it isn't that original, it still pays off quit well. The cast is great. Anthony Hopkins seems to get away with an English accent in every movie he does,but his acting was solid as usual. Antonio Banderas is teriffic as the new Zorro and there's funny moments between Hopkins and Banderas as teacher and student respectively. Catherine Zeta-Jones is very appealing in her role also. The only real complaint I have is that the bad guys never seem like a real threat. The direction by Martin Campbell is very good and the editing was great.

","THE MASK OF ZORRO ****1/2 Stunning, visually rich, and highly acclaimed motion picture that retells the story of the Masked Swordsman (Anthony Hopkins) serving the people of California by saving them from the devious plans and conspiracies the Spanish empire and trained forces carry out. Hopkins trains a new Zorro (properly portrayed by Antonio Benderas) to take his place and save California from a tasteless fate. What subsequently takes place is nothing short of first-rate entertainment. The film has delightful humour and well choreographed sword-on-sword sequences. The musical score by James Horner provides additional supportive elements to capture all of the film's diverse moments. Excellent direction by Martin Campbell.

","Wonderful movie, visually rich and a nice blend of comedy, action and romance, well-written. Hopkins is great; so is Banderas as Zorro-in-training, and Zeta-Jones sparkles in her scenes with him. Very little gore or skin, what there is serves the plot instead of BEING the plot. The best movie I've seen in a long time. Note: previews make it look a lot less interesting than it actually is--you just see a lot of things being slashed and blown up, while the comic scenes between Hopkins and Banderas don't really appear (the best part of the film).",/review/rw3041814/?ref_=tt_urv

","Always enjoyed the classic ""Mark of Zorro"" original in the 40's, however, Anthony Hopkins (Don Diego/Zorro), ""Meet Joe Black"",'98 gave an outstanding performance through out the entire picture and taught the new Zorro all the tricks of the trade with the dueling and sword swinging, almost looked like Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.in action!  Catherine Zeta-Jones, (Elana)""Chicago"",'02 performed a very torrid Spanish dance and was extremely HOT during the entire picture. Elana almost lost her underwear with the swift blades of the newly taught young ZORRO introduced in this film.  This is a very refreshing new approach to the Zorro image and is a must see film !",/review/rw3041814/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2014,Samiam3,," A personal favourite blockbuster
","In 1998, for the first time since the days of Errol Flynn, Hollywood gave us a swashbuckling epic which did something that no similar film has done since. It managed to deliver all the goods without being heavily dependant on a dumbed down story or heavy use of clichés. While the formula is somewhat schematic, it has a real sense of romantic age, glamour and historical accuracy to it as well as fully rounded, non-artificial characters, and a story that combines humour/action/emotion perfectly, never too little or too much. This is probably the best post- Flynn swashbuckler, and while plenty of similar films have come out since, there is something about The Mask of Zorro which so far it has not been parallelled.",/review/rw3041814/?ref_=tt_urv
