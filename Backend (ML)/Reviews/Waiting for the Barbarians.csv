23 November 2009,Hitchcoc,9," The Indiscretions of a Child
","We are such a fragile race, so affected by the shifts of a societal breeze. A child misinterprets what she sees and brings about the destruction of people she actually loves. So caught up in her dramatic wants and angry, she lies, and that lie haunts her for her remaining days. This is a movie version of a wonderful book, the best I read that year. It captures the pain and the need to make true restitution. The truth of the matter is that sometimes it just doesn't work that way. The characters come to realize that. It's a slice of life in wartime and all the chickens come home to roost. Probably the most gut wrenching thing is that the character that causes the most damage has great success in life, but carries around her guilt to her dying day. She is never allowed to truly enjoy things. This is a really fine movie and, except for some breaks in editing, does a nice job of presenting the issues in the novel.",/review/rw1789544/?ref_=tt_urv

21 September 2007,JamesHitchcock,9," Forgive Our Foolish Ways
","""Atonement"" is structurally comparable to a three-act play, with a brief epilogue. The three central characters are Briony, the younger daughter of the wealthy Tallis family, her older sister Cecilia and Robbie Turner, Cecilia's childhood friend. Robbie is from a humble social background (his mother is one of the family's servants), but academically brilliant, and Mr Tallis has paid for him to be educated through grammar school and Cambridge, where he has obtained a First. A brilliant future seemingly awaits him, in whatever profession he chooses, and he wants to pursue a career in medicine. ",/review/rw1789544/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2007,evanston_dad,7," One Third of ""Atonement"" Is Brilliant
","The first third of ""Atonement"" is superb. We are introduced to a group of affluent English aristocrats whiling away their summer hours at a massive estate. One of them, Cecilia (Keira Knightley), is nursing a raging case of sexual attraction to her childhood friend and now family gardener, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), while another, Cecilia's young sister Briony (Saoirse Ronan), spends her day writing a play which she plans to perform for a family gathering later that evening. Everyone is bored and listless in the summer heat. Briony, prey to an overactive imagination, keeps witnessing a series of increasingly serious moments of intimacy between Cecilia and Robbie that she isn't old enough to fully understand, and finally a false accusation by her is responsible for sending Robbie away from the estate in handcuffs. Everything about this part of the film is brilliant. The director Joe Wright ratchets the sexual tension to an almost unbearable pitch, and I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen.",/review/rw1789544/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2020,CubsandCulture,10," I am not sure why Dunkirk got made when this film exists
","I deeply appreciate Atonement for other reasons and while the films are about 10 years apart I am utterly perplexed by how Nolan's Dunkirk became the critical darling it is, especially since this film exists. This film isn't about the evacuation of Dunkirk or WWII (those elements form the background for a fully realized troubled romance and family drama) and YET this film spends about 20 minutes on Dunkirk and it conveys the horror, defeat and dread of it it far sharper and more resonant than Nolan's film does for its entire run time. There is a one very long shot of soldiers on the beach that even manages to capture the whole what is time when facing your death thing better than Nolan's film.",/review/rw1789544/?ref_=tt_urv

26 August 2007,PizzicatoFishCrouch,9," Beautiful, sad, and McAvoy excels as usual.
","13-year-old Briony Tallis is a girl with a huge imagination who loves to write. The film starts at her completion of a play, ""The Trials of Arabella"", a morality tale on love and the dangers of being too hasty with one's emotions. From her opening line in the prologue, various multisyllabic words that I didn't understand were employed, and the audience giggles at her pretension: evidently, this is a girl whose world is shaped with words, regardless of whether or not she understands them. Witnessing her sister Cecilia dive into a pool as their housekeeper's son Robbie watches after her, Briony pictures as scene she has no understanding of, and, by the end of the day, she will have changed lives for the worse, and she will spend the rest of her life regretting and trying to atone this mistake.",/review/rw1789544/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2007,simonparker1990,10," If this doesn't win Best Picture next year it will have been robbed!
","Its very rare that a movie like Atonement comes along and leaves me completely speechless and in complete and utter awe for hours after I have seen it. You see Atonement isn't just the best movie I have seen all year, its one of the best movies I have seen in a very, very long time. And by that I include Pan's Labyrinth, yes this movie is better than my favourite movie of 2006, and I never imagined Atonement would ever come close to that level of greatness until fifteen minutes into the movie last night. Atonement is an unusual movie, in fact its fair to say that I have never seen anything quite like it. Its a rare movie that actually I adored so much that I am going to hunt down a copy of the book tomorrow just to see the comparisons. Its not an easy movie I'll be honest, if you go in expecting something light hearted and easy to digest then you will leave the cinema feeling very cheated. This is a movie that deals with very dark things at times. No matter how much I desire to write in depth about every aspect of the movie I just can't, the movies greatest triumph is the fact that its plot is so intricately woven that if you ruin one part of the storyline to anyone then the movies impact is slightly lessened. The storyline is just brilliant, but its the climax that leaves you in store for the biggest shocker, and its this shocker that leaves you reeling long after you have left the cinema. The performances here are all spectacular, I think its fair to say that the two leads, James McAvoy and Keira Knightly shall be receiving at the very least nominations for Best Actor/Best Actress. The score is beautiful, whoever came up with the idea of using a typewriter as a musical instrument deserves to be praised heavily. Its rare a score leaves me feeling moved, the score in this movie did that for me. That's yet another Oscar that this movie deserves to win. All in all Atonement is just perfection, I doubt you'll find a better movie this year or even for the next three years. In a time when Blockbusters get all the attention it is nice to see a small, but intelligent movie leave me in awe.",/review/rw1789544/?ref_=tt_urv

","A budding young writer named Briony witnesses an innocent act she doesn't fully understand between her older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and long-time family servant Robbie (James McAvoy) one restless summer day on her family's lavish country estate in 1935 England that leads to scandal in Joe Wright's dreadfully sumptuous adaptation of Ian McEwan's international best-selling novel, ""Atonement.""

9 April 2018,classicsoncall,7," ""I will return, to find you, love you, marry you, and live without shame.""
","I was left with a bitter feeling at the end of this movie after hearing the elderly Briony Tallis (Vanessa Redgrave) explain to an interviewer how she manufactured the extended love story between her sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and lover Robbie Turner (James McAvoy). Granted, and while putting things into perspective, young Briony (Saoirse Ronan) at the age of thirteen was not only mistaken in her accusation about Robbie, but was also in a bit of revenge mode after being rebuffed by him after the fountain 'drowning' incident. Her twenty first and final novel was meant to put to rest her conflicted heart over the matter of destroying two lives, but her means of 'atonement' at that point had no conciliatory effect on the way I felt about her character. Would that the relationship between Cecilia and Robbie have turned out the way it did following the war and it's aftermath, but it was all a fiction concocted by the troubled author. In a way, it's a story that never happened, at least as far as the latter half of the picture goes, so it left this viewer feeling as if he had been strung along. I don't think we had closure on chocolate heir Paul Marshall (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Lola Quincey (Juno Temple) either, as their relationship further damned the future of Cecilia and Robbie as well. They could have come forward to contradict Briony's story when she was thirteen without jeopardizing their reputations, although to be fair, Lola was a kid at the time too and was certainly scared about what happened between her and Paul. So ultimately, all thoughts of a tragic love story between the principals was shattered by the end of the picture, leaving me with only a degree of measured contempt for the author who couldn't (or wouldn't) take responsibility when it mattered.",/review/rw1789544/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2007,littlemartinarocena,8," Love And Death In a Cold Climate
","The superb Ian McEwan book translated into cold beautiful images by the startling Joe Wright and scriptwriter Christopher Hampton. The result is a series of powerful rushes and abrupt stops. A pacing that, perhaps, is a bit too self conscious for its own good doesn't help us to connect the emotional dots. I had the feeling I had lost something in the love story of the protagonists - something that didn't happen to me reading the book. By the time the ""injustice"" takes place I was taken by the pain of the injustice but not by Knightley and McAvoy's liaison. Their love story is left to its own devices. The beauty of the images is overwhelming and the assuredness of Joe Wright at his second feature after the, much better, ""Pride and Prejudice"" keeps you going. The score tends to be monotonous and irritating but in spite of all that I intend to see ""Atonement"" again and I would recommend it with just the above mentioned reservations.",/review/rw1789544/?ref_=tt_urv

","With 7 Golden Globe nominations, ""Atonement"" is one of those movies for which the script is important. It is adapted from a novel by Ian McEwan, same as ""Enduring love"" (an impressive performance from Daniel Craig who, incidentally, was a relatively unknown at the time, at least on a global basis). Starting with an innovative use of the sound from a typewriter for percussion with a pulsating urgency, the movie plays out like a concerto with 3 movements.",/review/rw1789544/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2008,Turfseer,3," A Tale of Two Stories
","Atonement reminds me of Scorcese's ""Gangs of New York"" in that the director felt compelled to insert a 'second story' into the main narrative. In 'Gangs', there's a whole sequence about the New York Draft Riots which is completely superfluous, tacked on at the end simply because the director was enamored with a particular interesting piece of history. Similarly, in 'Atonement', we're treated to a glimpse of the British Army retreat at Dunkirk which is brilliantly photographed and reminds one of a scene from hell in a Hieronymus Bosch painting. Despite the Dunkirk scene's artfulness, it's all padding and it needs to be there because without it, 'Atonement' would be little more than a specious melodrama about the evils of the British aristocracy.

","Atonement is being acclaimed now as one of the best films of the year, a surefire contender for the best picture prize at the Oscars (at least, apparently, as a ""proper"" film as opposed to the crime classic No Country for Old Men). It's not hard to understand it, for a good lot of the running time; Joe Wright, the director, has taken what is an apparently beautiful book (unread by me) and transformed it into the stuff of true existential crises. It's about a young girl, Briony, who witnesses what she thought she saw as a crime. This might seem unclear at first, but it isn't, it's a clear move on the part of immediate revenge for a tryst she witnessed between her sister and a worker (Kiera Knightley and James McAvoy). He's sent to prison, then to war, where unforeseen circumstances may change everyone's lives.",/review/rw1789544/?ref_=tt_urv

","When ATONEMENT was released in 2007 I made a point not seeing it due to the hype . Critics were falling over themselves to judge the film a "" masterpiece "" and it's interesting that all these critics were British . When it comes to harmless shallow jingoism the British film critics are unique . While some countries have an obscene tradition of murdering people because "" they're not one of us "" the British lovers of art fawn sycophantically over the slightest piece of mediocrity if there's some Anglo-Saxon Celtic connection and since ATONEMENT is set in a pre war 1930s Britain with posh folk we have the archetypal class driven British movie that appeals to jealous egalitarian Americans . It was interesting that the film didn't do very well at the American box office and that despite receiving an avalanche of prestigious nominations it had a very small award from nomination ratio .

1 September 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," Beautiful to watch, and very well done as an adaptation.
","I read the book and watched the film recently, and I really liked them both. The book is beautifully written, with flawless narrative detail, though at first it isn't very easy to sink your teeth into. The film on the other hand is beautiful to watch, wonderful cinematography and excellent period detail. The music was quite nostalgic, and I suppose positively hypnotic. The screenplay was wonderful to start with, but the last part's narrative did lose its way a little, and despite the fact that I thought Briony's portrayal was fine on the most part, when she first finds that Lola is being hurt by who she suspects is Robbie, I didn't find her as comforting as she was in the book. The library scene I thought was more believable in the book, it just felt thrown in in the film. I will say, the performances were wonderful, with Kiera Knightly at her loveliest and James McAvoy very handsome and heroic as the two lovers who embark on a complex love relationship. Also worth of note are the performances of two great actresses, Vanessa Redgrave and Harriet Walter, who didn't disappoint here.
