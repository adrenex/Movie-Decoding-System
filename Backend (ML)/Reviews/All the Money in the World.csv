30 December 2017,ThomasDrufke,7," Greed
","It's nearly impossible to separate what happened off screen with the final product of All the Money in the World. With that said, Ridley Scott pretty much couldn't have done a better job at making a seamless transition from Kevin Spacey to Christopher Plummer in the role of J. Paul Getty. Inevitably that will be the one thing people always remember about this film, but in the end, the film succeeds elsewhere as a thriller based around the kidnapping of Getty's grandson in Rome in 1973.",/review/rw5194290/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," Compelling true-story presented exquisitely
","The cinematography, set details, directing and acting were all outstanding in this compelling true-story crime drama. Replacing Kevin Spacey with a re-shoot that cost 10M extra was seamless although the editing could have been tighter. The pace could have also been a little faster to make the 133min length not feel like 160 mins. Otherwise a very enjoyable film. 8/10 from me.",/review/rw5194290/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2017,ferguson-6,7," your money or his life
","Greetings again from the darkness. The grandson of J Paul Getty, the wealthiest man in the world, was kidnapped while in Rome in 1973. That fascinating story holds more than enough drama for an engaging movie, and certainly did not need the notoriety or artistic challenges brought on by the Kevin Spacey scandal. With filming completed and a release date mere weeks away, director Ridley Scott made the decision to erase all evidence of Mr. Spacey's J Paul Getty, and replace him with Oscar winner Christopher Plummer. The ""do-over"" is nearly seamless and it's not a stretch to believe the second version turned out better than the first.",/review/rw5194290/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2019,AlsExGal,7," True-story crime drama from director Ridley Scott was a logistical accomplishment
","The film tells the story of the 1973 kidnapping of J. Paul Getty III (Charlie Plummer). He's held for an exorbitant ransom, but the kidnappers figure that since the young man's grandfather is J. Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer), the richest man in the world, he shouldn't have a problem paying it. They don't know Getty, a notorious cheapskate and skinflint who first refuses to pay any ransom, and then tries to negotiate it down to only an amount that is tax deductible. This naturally infuriates the boy's mother Gail Harris (Michelle Williams), who works with Getty family security chief Fletcher Chase (Mark Wahlberg) on getting the boy home safely.",/review/rw5194290/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2018,TheLittleSongbird,5," More miserly than Getty himself
","Saw 'All the Money in the World' due to that its subject is incredibly interesting. Ridley Scott has also some great films ('Alien' and 'Blade Runner' especially are masterpieces of their genre), the cast is a talented one (particularly Michelle Williams and Christopher Plummer) and the trailer was one of the best of the year.",/review/rw5194290/?ref_=tt_urv

4 July 2018,vijaychandrank,8," Money is everything..!
","This movie is one of old classy types where tension is built around dialogues and the predicament characters find themselves in. Christopher plummer is riveting as a greedy billionaire who thinks about evading tax in every walk of his life and want to be in control of everything he sees. Michelle williams is terrific as a caring mother and not the usual dumb potrayals you normally find in these kind of movies. She is smart, witty and sees hope even in darker moments . The scene where she asks ""Do they want me to cry?"" potrays the real emotion people go through in situations like these. Mark wahlberg is more of a cliched character where you can predict pretty much what he will do. There are intense scenes in second half where the kid acted really well and you felt the pain character went through. Even though its a serious film, you might find humor in traces which made sure its an enjoyable watch.",/review/rw5194290/?ref_=tt_urv

",You may or may not be aware of the fact that Christopher Plummer came on board after Kevin Spacey had to go amidst controversy (sexual allegations from the past). So bring in Christopher Plummer - and you may try to think at times how Kevin might have done the same thing. Try not to and instead enjoy the movie as it is.,/review/rw5194290/?ref_=tt_urv

27 March 2018,bondscammer,9," Plummer Kidnaps The Film
","How does Plummer do it? Shows up on a day or two notice, then proceeds to steal the film from underneath everyone!
He is incredible, those Golden Globe & Oscar noms were deserved. 
Scott is an expert director, and knows how to pace, stage and film each and every scene perfectly.
Wahberg hasn't been as good as this since 'The Departed', and Michelle Williams is a revelation. Goodbye Streep, I'll take Michelle anyday!
This plays as a gritty thriller, tempered with some humour, within a great script that maintains your interest and no fat left to trim!
I loved this film, I hope the controversy over recasting doesn't keep anyone from enjoying it!",/review/rw5194290/?ref_=tt_urv

","There is a passage from the Bible that says that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into heaven. This movie is a testament to that. The acting is outstanding, you really feel like you are there. The mood of Italy and Europe of the 1970s infuses the film. Terrorism is in the air with the Munich Olympics of 1972, the Red Brigades and Baader-Meinhof gang. The depiction of Getty the oil magnate is shown to us by his various statements and actions. A truly gothic character. The gangster kidnappers are also frightening in their normal everyday lives that accept criminality as if it were like a walk in the park. Hard to believe a time of telephone booths, ringing telephones and sending letters. Ransom demands took time.",/review/rw5194290/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2018,liufilms-yl,5," A drama without drama
","This could have been a human drama of unbearable tension instead it's a movie manufactured with devious intentions. Devious in the real world, in movie making terms is totally accepted to do anything to lure people into the movie theaters. Probably their marketing people thought that a detailed slicing of an ear may do it. It made me so angry. No tension, no passion. The only reason to see the film is Michelle Williams. I didn't realized it was her until well into the movie, in fact until she has a scene with Mark Whalberg. She is real and truthful, when they stay with her everything works. Christopher Plummer plays the old mean billionaire to perfection but I must admit I thought of Kevin Spacey throughout. Everything is shot without real thought behind it. I liked the wind taking over the newspapers but the kidnappers remain a blurry mystery to me, who were they really? They looked like actors to me.",/review/rw5194290/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2019,duckonthedam,4," Would have been better if they stuck to the facts
","Although this dragged on and on for most of the movie, the addition of the totally OTT fictitious rescue chase scene at the end, pushed this film into the ridiculous. On top of that, the portrayal as the mother as the new ""heir"" was just so st√πpid, and further pushed this into unrealistic and simplistic happily ever after stories.",/review/rw5194290/?ref_=tt_urv

","By now, almost everyone knows about the last minute switch of Christopher Plummer in place of current-pariah Kevin Spacey as pivotal Billionaire J. Paul Getty in Ridley Scott's ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD, so when I checked out Plummer's Oscar nominated turn, I couldn't but help see if I could tell when Scott put in a new scene and where he just ""augmented"" his scenes with Plummer.

","I remember the stories of Paul Getty with pay phones in his house for his guests. He was always a picture boy for the horrors of money. Nobody paid any attention to the horrors not the real ones anyway, just the exterior ones of opulence, meanness and greed. Everything for and because of money, everything. The kidnapping of young J Paul Getty caught the attention of the world then, the plight of his mother is the stuff great drama is made of and here Michelle Williams does wonders with her character. She is totally true, one hundred per cent of the time, but her director doesn't know how to capture it. The film is a rambling, repetitious, undramatic product by Ridley Scott. I didn't detect any real thought behind it. Just craftsmanship and that sometimes is enough, but not this time. I suppose money was also behind this enterprise. Even the stitching of Christopher Plummer in place of Kevin Spacey has a totally commercial connotation. Mark Whalberg? I like him but everyone laughed when he appeared on the screen. So completely out of place, specially when confronted by the powerful authenticity of the wonderful Michelle Williams. All in all a dispiriting affair in more ways than one.",/review/rw5194290/?ref_=tt_urv

","""All The Money In the World"" (2017 release; 132 min.) is ""inspired by true events"", we are reminded at the beginning. As the movie opens, we are told it is ""Rome, 1973"", where we see the 16 yr. old Paul Getty (whose grandfather J. Paul Getty is the richest man in the world's history) is wandering the streets of Rome late one night, only to be abducted. Soon thereafter the abductors demand a ransom of $17 million (about $99 million in today's money). When Paul's mom approaches the elder Getty, he refuses to pay. The voice over by Paul reminds us: ""We look just like you but are nothing like you..."" The movie then gives us the nutshell version of how J Paul Getty made his fortune, taking us to ""Saudi Arabia 1948"" and the ""Toulon, France Shipyard, 1958"". At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw5194290/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2018,pauletterich-la,3," Give Me Your Money
","I was familiar with the entire saga and I was eager to see the Ridley Scott dramatization of the events. Now I saw it. A truly depressing movie experience by the director of the original Blade Runner (I'm not going to talk about the 2017 version) All by the numbers with a commercial eye that, I must say, is faltering big time. Did you see Scott's version of Robin Hood with Russell Crowe? No, here Scott attempts the conquering of box office grosses by a close up of J Paul Getty's ear as he's been mutilated. What a shame! Ridley Scott had the extraordinary Michelle Williams to play the mother and she is the one that makes it true even if the script doesn't provide her with well structured scenes and gives her Mark Whalberg to bounce of. He seems the hostage at times, delivering his lines without an ounce of real conviction. Charlie Plummer (oddly enough no relation to Christopher Plummer) is lovely and Christopher Plummer appears as a techno distraction but if they thought we were not going to be replacing Plummer for Spacey in our minds, all the time - aware of the performance as well as the technical wonder - they were wrong. As we left the theater that was the main topic of conversation. Plummer/Spacey. I'm afraid that greed played a part in this operation.",/review/rw5194290/?ref_=tt_urv

","Entertaining for sure, but the overall movie felt a little flat to me.
