","At Eternity's Gate is perhaps one of the most artistic films that I've seen. It somehow manages to give the sense that it took Van Gogh's painting style and put it in film form, and it was quite effective.",/review/rw5319116/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2018,PotassiumMan,7," Van Gogh through the eyes of Julian Schnabel
","Vincent Van Gogh's last days in the south of France are depicted in this heartfelt drama by Julian Schnabel. Willem Dafoe gives a powerful performance as the destitute, troubled painter who was not understood by those in his own time. As Van Gogh seeks to express his extraordinary eye for nature and portraits, those around him are either put off, wary or sometimes intrigued. His brother is his only real comfort.",/review/rw5319116/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2018,markgluckstern,10," Don't think of At Eternity's Gate as a movie movie
","Rather think of it as a painted film, with one artist (Schnabel) trying to convey what it is to be another (Van Gogh). At Eternity's Gate is an immersion into the world of Van Gogh. Art conveys something about the world and the human condition words can never express. After watching the movie I came to realize other ways of trying to understand Van Gogh and his art fall short of this immersion. If you were to take an audio tour of a Van Gogh exhibit you would not finish the tour with the same feeling or understanding as you might get from watching the movie. Everything about the movie is spare, whittled down to an essential nub. The dialogue doesn't matter. What does matter are the long, silent scenes of Van Gogh in Nature and at home, and the times where he speaks directly to the audience, informing it of what it is to be Van Gogh. The occasionally jumpy camera shots and the overlapping dialogue may not have been completely necessary (and obviously a major turn-off for various other viewers), but they do help to establish what it may have been like to be Van Gogh. Madness? Sure, if that label works for you. Clearly, Van Gogh was different. Mad or not, he had his difficulties fitting in to society, any society. The last 20 minutes or so are the most painterly. After absorbing an hour of background material, all the film and Van Gogh have told you allows you to understand his world. When he talks about light, the screen is flooded with light, but even when the screen turns to gloom, you see the world as Van Gogh did. The walls are painted as they were in the background of a Van Gogh painting. And you the viewer? You sit back and drink it all in.",/review/rw5319116/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2019,TheLittleSongbird,7," Through Van Gogh's art and mind
","Biopics don't always have great reputations, but to me despite many playing loose with the facts and quite a lot not exploring their subjects enough or being too conventional many have a lot to recommend on their own merits as films. Vincent van Gogh's paintings are a thing of beauty and van Gogh was a very fascinating man and one of history's most influential artists. Willem Dafoe has also been great, fantastic even, in other things. So there were plenty of reasons as to why 'At Eternity's Gate' had big potential to be great.",/review/rw5319116/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2018,lor_,," Julian shoots himself in the foot
","Stealing many a technique from far better filmmakers, Julian Schnabel botches this obviously personal film about Van Gogh. It fails to deliver any insight into the artist and is surprisingly stupid in terms of its treatment of basic themes.",/review/rw5319116/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2019,ebbyamir,8," Not a Hollywood film, but an excellent film
","This film doesn't follow the Hollywood structure. It's not a biography like you might expect, and the plot isn't defined. Instead, this is an attempt to get inside Van Gogh's head, and a brilliant one at that. Imagine being the world's greatest artist, with zero validation and constant ridicule by the establishment around you. That's the torturous state of being this film encapsulates and does it with purpose. At times, the cinema language gets more experimental than necessarily to accomplish its goal, but I commend the director for pushing the boundaries of standard filmmaking and letting us inhabit Van Gogh's mind for this brief period. I genuinely felt a loss for this escape from my own mind when Van Gogh passed. I recommend anyone involved with artistic or creative thinking to watch this film.",/review/rw5319116/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film succeeds in various ways: Dafoe delivers a marvelous portrayal of van Gogh, and Rupert Friend offers a dignified performance as Theo, his brother.

As someone who has seen most of the films directed by Schnabel, I find him an insightful, astute director, yet I wish he would have introduced more nuance into certain scenes.",/review/rw5319116/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2019,iamichor,9," Masterful.
","At Eternity's Gate is an amazing piece of art. I will admit that in order to fully appreciate its artistic offerings one would most definitely need very minor prior knowledge to who Vincent Van Gogh was. What his ideologies were, and the major events of his life, as well as his relationship with his brother. The way lines are repeated multiple times in a way that sounds like an echo chamber to show the audience the way Vincent is perceiving conversation on a delay, rationally speaking. One critique I see a lot is of the very long scenes of Vincent running around in wilderness looking for something to paint, and the overbearing music that surrounds those scenes. I disagree with these critiques but I do understand them. I feel it was necessary to have this music in order for the audience to understand the pure child-like joy Vincent felt while looking for something to paint, and while experiencing nature. I highly recommend this film for any Vincent Van Gogh fans. It is just shy of a perfect movie in my opinion, but I can see why someone would very much disagree with that.",/review/rw5319116/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2018,thomas1298,9," Uncomfortable to watch but that's what made it great (like the artist himself)
","This film tackles the story of an artist creating masterpieces for later generations but not for his own. All the techniques that bothered other reviewers--the handheld camera, loud piano soundtrack, looped dialog--all emphasized a life of loneliness and ridicule that made the audience experience those emotions.",/review/rw5319116/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2019,lee_eisenberg,7," the problem with being a genius is that you're so far ahead of everyone that people consider you crazy
","Vincent van Gogh is widely recognized as one of the grand masters of impressionism. That is, he's now recognized thusly. During his lifetime, he only managed to sell one painting. Maybe it was that he was too far ahead of his time that people just couldn't appreciate his genius. It wasn't until almost 50 years after his death that people really started taking notice of his work.",/review/rw5319116/?ref_=tt_urv

30 November 2018,gortx,," Impressionist view of the famed Post-Impressionist artist
","Vincent Van Gogh is an artist seemingly tailor made for the movies - the brilliance, the madness, the short tragic life unappreciated in his time and....the ear! (the first I ever heard of Van Gogh was in elementary school. An artist so intense he cut his own ear off!? Cool!). Coming off last year's brilliantly animated LOVING VINCENT, comes the latest entry in the Van Gogh filmography, AT ETERNITY'S GATE.
Played by Willem Dafoe, this Van Gogh isn't given the traditional bio-pic treatment. It focuses on the last few months of the painter's life. The main details are there (including, yes, the ear incident), as are the characters such as Paul Gaugin (Oscar Isaac), Dr. Gachet (Mathieu Almaric) and, of course, his beloved brother Theo (Rupert Friend). Director Julian Schnabel (DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY, BEFORE NIGHT FALLS) and his co-writers including the esteemed Jean-Claude Carriere (who's worked with the likes of Bunuel, Schlondorff, Godard and Wadja) give us more an impressionist* treatment. Abetted by Cinematographer Benoit Delhomme, we get a kaleidoscope of images, sounds and visions. Delhomme's hand-held camera-work takes some getting used to, and, quite frankly, can be a bit distracting at times (the demands supposedly forced the camera operator to give up on the opening shot and Delhomme had to operate himself!). Tatiana Livoskaia's minimalist score adds to the disjointed perspective.
Schnabel's fragmented style doesn't give the actors much room to breathe, but Dafoe et al. acquit themselves capably. The cumulative effect will certainly not be to everyone's taste (particularly those desiring a traditional biography), but, GATE is a vivid impression of what those final months may have been like. One artist's vision of another's.",/review/rw5319116/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2019,skepticskeptical,6," Severely marred by amateurish camera work
","I wanted to like this film, but for the entire first half I was constantly distracted by the dots produced by reflections off camera lenses. When I take a photo with those red or yellow or blue dots (because the sun is too direct), I write it off as an error and thank myself for having shot lots of other images from different angles. I have no idea how a professional cameraman could have allowed this to happen over and over again. Near the end, there was a huge line in the middle of the frame for entire scenes. Perhaps this was intended to convey van Gogh´s bleary and confused perspective of his surroundings, but in the first half of the film, the images were *of* van Gogh, and so the same explanation cannot be given.",/review/rw5319116/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2018,paul-allaer,1," Wants to be ""Art"" (with capital A), induces headache instead
","""At Eternity's Gate"" (2018 release; 110 min.) is a bio-pic about painter Van Gogh's last years. As the movie opens, we hear a monologue (on a black screen), where Van Gogh muses ""I'd like to be just like the others"", but of course he is not. In a subsequent scene, we see Van Gogh in discussion wit fellow painter Paul Gauguin, who advises Van Gogh to look for new light (literally) in the South. We are then in ""Arles, South of France"", and Van Gogh makes a painting of his worn out shoes... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw5319116/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2020,wildsparrow16,10," A beautiful portrayal of a beautiful human...
","I am not well versed in art and I went into this only knowing that I love Van Gogh's art and knowing a bit about his troubled life. This movie knocked my emotions out of the park (ok, out of the wheat fields in this particular case). Dafoe never has disappointed, but he WAS Van Gogh in this movie. The emotions he was able to elicit were a constant tug on the heart (as if Van Gogh's life doesn't already do that). The movie was well-done from his humble beginning through his rather unappreciated life, his descent into mental turmoil and realistic to the very end of his controversial death.",/review/rw5319116/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2019,chiaragiacobelli,5," I didn't like it
","Another movie about Vincent Van Gogh, trying to say something new and different, but everything has been already said and this is, in my opinion, a bad experiment: too much attention in the way of moving the camera and shooting the scenes, so that at the end it is difficult to follow the story.
Also, there is a lot of introspection rearding the protagonist, but very often it seems forced, not natural; actually, I don't think they really expressed Vincent's thoughts and philosophy.
I would have prefered a linear movie really concentrated in the figure of the painter, without the necessity to produce something artistic and particular. To conclude, here the metacinema seems to be more important that the cinema.",/review/rw5319116/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2019,javomed88,8," Getting into Van Gogh's Mind
","As mentioned by Willem Dafoe during his interview at the Academy Awards ceremony, the intention of this film was never to be a crowd-pleaser, standard biopic. This aim of 'At Eternity's Gate' was to tell a story from a whole different perspective. The technique and point of view is supposed to make you see and feel just like Van Gogh did during his last days. If you really immerse yourself into the film, you'd realise it almost feels like a virtual reality experience. Maybe this film should have been made in a VR format.",/review/rw5319116/?ref_=tt_urv

5 December 2018,linen-72394,10," See the World Through Van Gogh's Eyes
","If this movie is playing in your area, don't miss it. Beautiful, poignant, historically accurate, its dialogue is lifted directly from Van Gogh's correspondence with his contemporaries. Vincent, Theo, and Gauguin come alive as do the people in his portraiture. Willem Dafoe's performance as Vincent is jaw dropping. Dafoe's gaunt presentation as Van Gogh's self portrait after slicing off his ear, fur cap on his head, against that saffron yellow wall, radiates an intensity and humanity so often missing biopics of artists. Think you know yellow? Think again. Once you've seen this film, you'll think of Van Gogh with a tenderness usually reserved for your child. See it now if you can.",/review/rw5319116/?ref_=tt_urv
