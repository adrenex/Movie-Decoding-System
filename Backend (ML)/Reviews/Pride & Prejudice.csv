5 December 2022,paul-allaer,8," Opening episode had my attention from start to finish
","As Episode 1 of ""George & Tammy"" (2022 release; 6 episodes of about 50 min. Each) opens, the King of Country is barely holding it together at the Grand Ole Opry. Soon after, Tammy is introduced to George at a seedy motel where he is staying with 2 women (neither being his wife), and she convinces him to let her open some of his shows. It's not long before George takes a serious interest in Tammy, who is married herself... At this pint we are 10 minutes into Episode 1.",/review/rw8784028/?ref_=tt_urv

10 December 2022,avakay-98287,7," Wanted this to be better
","The music was not right....it was dragging at times. The voices are not as strong as the real George and Tammy. George's voice was one of a kind. I saw him in person a few times. Maybe they should have lip synched instead. Jessica does look a little like Tammy. The action was
true according to accounts I had heard before. I think this mini series could have been better. Now I'll have to get my George and Tammy albums out and give them another listen. Tim Blake Nelson was Roy Acuff who also had a big voice but not in this show. Above all, the music has to be right for a music bio to succeed. Wish this one had.",/review/rw8784028/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2022,henrylbs,10," A Great Lady and an Impossible Man
",George Jones was already a country music legend but heavy drinking was taking its' toll and he was on the way out unless he could do something about it. But there is no sign that he is about to do this or that he even cares what he is doing to himself until Tammy Wynette enters his life. Tammy was on the rise being only a year and a half in Nashville with three successful records to her credit. Tammy idolizes George or rather his music and finally is able to be hired as an opening singer for him. She is in love with him from the start but he is married and so is she with three kids of her own from a previous marriage and three inherited from her second husband. George falls in love with her and takes her away from her husband but their problems are just beginning and the biggest problem is that George is a self-destructive abusive drunk. I've only seen the first two episodes but it is pretty obvious how this is going to play out. Tammy is going to rise to the heights while George is probably going to sink to the depths and Tammy is going to hold onto him as long as she can but it will prove more than she can bare.,/review/rw8784028/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2022,virginia67,4," Eh
","Great acting... the real story is too good to mess up too badly, I do wish that they might have given a little more back story on both sides. (For those who don't know George or Tammy's music) what I'm saying is that the acting was incredible it's a testament to these actors... but.... It takes a lot of country lonesome to capture George and Tammy....the singing is so bad that we are actually fast forwarding through it. It's AWFUL. This review has no spoilers.... No need for it, the singing does that. Maybe next time just dub in the real music or get Faith Hill to play Tammy. She would have been incredible in this role. I suggest that whoever made this movie needs to go watch some of the great classic legendary music that these legends made. The crowd at the Ryman auditorium would never had crowded the stage like in the first episode. Roy Acuff NEVER wore a cowboy hat... These are just little things that do matter.",/review/rw8784028/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2023,mstevm-88545,10," Great series!
","I am not much of a country fan so I had no expectations or the knowledge to nit pic the performances. I think both Jessica and Michael should win awards for their fantastic roles and, I loved their singing as well, this is a departure for Michael Shannon from my experience and he blew me away, Jessica Chastain is so beautiful, I now have a crush on her. I had no idea that their story was so fraught with addictions, jealousy and the usual hangers on pushing them to perform so they could make money off them. Overall great casting and a heart felt sad love story worth telling. I am telling everyone I know to watch the show.",/review/rw8784028/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,thejdrage,6," I wanted to like it, but it's a high wire act

21 January 2023,jhsanford-76264,5," Tammy
","This show should be called Tammy, not George and Tammy. It is extremely one sided and really only about Tammy. Anything about George is put in a very dark light and I don't think this is the way it was. Tammy is not the saint. She did hit fame with the one song that she wrote about George, but George was an amazing artist. An amazing vocalist, song writer, etc. Everything in this show depicts him as a scumbag, criminal, abuser, etc. I really do not care for the actor for George, although the actress for Tammy was pretty good. Again, I would like to see a show from George's perspective. This is a very, very biased portrayal from Tammy only. This should be called 'Tammy'.... Realized it made a little sense due to the fact that the actress for Tammy is the Executive Producer of the show..... Disappointing.",/review/rw8784028/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,Mombrain,8," Interesting and Keeps your Attention
","It seems to be a trend right now to have shows about true life stories or loosely based stories. From start to finish it really kept my attention their love and struggles while hearing music I enjoy. I see people posting the singing was terrible, but I do not think so. Shannon especially sounded good. I think people get in their head the real singers and will not have it in their heads someone else singing some of the songs. Sometimes we do not see past the true performances on stage and tv. The characters we derive in our heads may be completely different than their true personalities so you got to go into it open minded. Unlike some of the other stories I have watched recently that the captivating parts were in the first 2-3 episodes this was different it kept my attention start to finish. I am sure that everything is not completely accurate, but I found it well put together and interesting.",/review/rw8784028/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2022,nettystuph,3," Horribly miscast and inaccurate.
","Being a huge George and Tammy fan, I was so excited to watch this. But after just the first episode, I won't be watching the rest. Michael Shannon is HORRIBLE as George Jones. His acting if fine overall, and his singing OK for an actor, but he embodies NOTHING of the real George Jones. Not his looks, personality or talent, I feel like I'm watching Hank (Williams) and Tammy, not George and Tammy. And the story telling part is so inaccurate and chopped up, that it bears little resemblance to the reality of how and when they really got together. He didn't just show up out of the blue after getting a haircut, to smash her dining table and haul her out of her house! Ugh!! So between a totally miscast leading actor and the nonsensical scenes rather than documented reality, I'm only giving this 2 stars for the nostalgia of George and Tammy. The production itself is a big fat zero disappointment for me. I won't be tuning in for the rest.",/review/rw8784028/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,julieact,6," Acting is fine but.....
","Jessica Chastain and Michael Shannon are always great in everything I've ever seen them in. The problem here is this feels like a generic version of the, so far, far superior Walk the Line, starring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. This may be the true story of George Jones and Tammy Wynette but you could almost change the names to Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash at this point. There are an abundance of situations that occur that are almost identical to the other project. Seeing as this is a series and not a movie, there will be more hours of content so hopefully at some point there will be something here that doesn't feel like a rerun.",/review/rw8784028/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2022,bserrett,1," Really wanted to like this, but...
","I was really excited about this series because I loved the ""real"" George & Tammy, but the first show was a painful to watch. Jessica is a great actress, but the slow, drawn out singing was painful. It needed to keep the ""Tammy"" musical timing, because that slow twangy impersonation is completely OFF! The one thing it does is make you go back an listen to the REAL recordings, just to get that sound out of your head! Could have been cast better and directed better. They should have taken cues from the Johnny Cash movie or the Elvis movie. I read great reviews from the Critics, but they obviously got paid to lie.",/review/rw8784028/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2022,philadkins-20765,3," Terrible attempt at singing.
","The only reason to watch a show like this would be the music but there is the problem. Everyone knows the story of George and Tammy, it is well documented and and was open and notorious at the time of the events. So you watch the show to listen to the music you remember, the problem is that the actors can not sing. I have no idea why actors think they can do everything just because they are actors but here is yet another example of their foolishness. Chastain is particularly bad, completely butchering the music. Hollywood, please have the actors lip sink in the future, they are not singers/musicians for a reason after all.",/review/rw8784028/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,timjculbertson,10," Emmy awards all around
","I for one never been a fan of early country and western music growing up, I knew who they were and their stories of comnflict kinda reminded you of Taylor and Burton. Its sad they were married a short time, given their history they should have been married much lopnger and its obviousm depsite all the troubles they did really still love each other, it just didnt work. The performance of Jessica and Michael had me sold from episode 1, their dramatic performances from them doing their own singing,m it was just a blessing. I see where josh Brolin was first signed, I think it could have worked but shannon had Jones down from the get go. I sure hope when the Emmy nominations are announced come next year, these two will be on the top of the list and better win too.",/review/rw8784028/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2022,helenahandbasket-93734,2," Definitely Not WtL
","No matter how hard they try, this cannot and will not be Walk the Line. I truly love Shannon, and he definitely looks the part, but there's something off about his portrayal of Jones.",/review/rw8784028/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2022,jannfann1,3," I wanted to love it....
","As a 62 year old who was raised on and steeped in classic country, Tammy and George in particular, I was excited to watch this. I learned how to spell D-I-V-O-R-C-E and custody before I could spell cat or dog. Jessica as Tammy when not singing is fine, but the minute she opens her mouth to sing...nope! I really tried but when she started mutilating Divorce, I was done. Ray, Bohemian Rhapsody, and the recent Elvis demonstrate there are actors who can embody the singers they are portraying. Jessica isn't it. She is portraying an iconic singer, the voice needs to be able to take the audience back and be believable. Michael Shannon just didn't cut it as George either. Sadly I turned it off and won't finish it.",/review/rw8784028/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2022,douglasmcbroom,6," No Show Jones
","George Jones had a sense of humor because he wrote and sang that song about his notorious habit of not showing up for his shows. Michael Shannon plays George and Shannon is a fine actor. He also has a face for classic country music; not this modern, blow-dried country music full of snowflakes who all look and sound the same and have Liberal sensibilities, but the hard-livin' hard-drinkin' country music stars in its heyday wherein they had individual personalities, iconic voices and the songs meant something.",/review/rw8784028/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,bloodfestpodcast,2," The Possum would be disappointed, not good..
","I grew up watching and listening to George Jones and Tammy Wynette, hoped for the best with this show, but it's bad. The music is great, Jessica does great playing Tammy. I love Michael Shannon as an actor, he's great, but terrible choice playing George Jones. He seemed more like a serial killer stalking his next victim than he did George Jones in this. Bonus is seeing Steve Zahn in this, his role was pretty comedic, though his on-screen time was fairly small. But overall, this doesn't do justice for George Jones. He needs an actual movie made, with someone playing him that can actually capture his persona. This wasn't it. Good try, but it sucked. As someone who grew up listening to George and Tammy, I'm highly disappointed in this.",/review/rw8784028/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,rosieceb-54028,9," Jessica Chastain performance is worth watching
","For one I enjoy movies based on real life especially on musician. I had been anticipating the day this would air which was today Dec 4, I was surprised it was a mini series and not a movie by how this episode ended. It left me wanting more. The chemistry between the two actors was undeniable. Great acting by both Michael Shannon and of course Jessica Chastain, I watch everything she is in. He is also a great actor. The main actors character George is just a mess in this from the start, while Tammy's character is a upcoming singer trying to make it in country music married with children who idolizes George music with a note pad of every song he has sang. Without giving away to much George obviously try's to work his way into Tammy's life by agreeing to have her open for him, agreeing to sing a song her husband has written, giving away a tour bus and inviting himself over for dinner. Causing friction in her marriage, you can feel something is about to happen and it does. The episode ends with you wanting more of the storyline.",/review/rw8784028/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2023,wvfempwolford,8," George Richey bad guy?
","I would rate this series a 10 but for the obvious bias toward George Richey. It's hard to imagine him being the conniving scoundrel.depicted given that he was married to Tammy for 20 years. That, and the fact that this series is based upon daughter Georgette's book, also having her input as adviser during production, and appearing in the last episode. In another review here, someone with a long history in Nashville music scene stated that this series was an attempt to redeem and salvage George Jones' legacy, though it was common knowledge that he regularly beat Tammy. In the scenes of Jones' drunken rages, we can see that behavior depicted shockingly, so the series was honest in that respect. As per the attraction & courtship in the early relationship between George and Tammy, it is depicted as all innocent and above board. C'mon, nobody believes a shampoo resulted in the table turning scene (however entertaining). Good performances by all. Singing was okay, but lacked the truly unique quality of both George and Tammy.",/review/rw8784028/?ref_=tt_urv

24 January 2023,silvasiembra,10," Blown Away to the point of liking Country
","This review is written to those who were never brought up listening to ""country"" music. I'm one who wasn't. I watched this series because I like the main actors. Man, I blown away by the lyrics of these songs and the way they were sung! I didn't care if George and Tammy's life was accurately portrayed. I cared more about how the actors and the series itself made the words to these songs so vivid to me. I congratulate everyone who made this emotional story possible... which included their youngest daughter. It made me appreciate this music so much more. I'm impressed how how these simple songs can be packed with so much emotion. I'm convinced that anyone who isn't familiar with this genre will develop a special liking for it. I sure as hell did.",/review/rw8784028/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,sarahdrymon,10," My HEART
",I am familiar with both George and Tammy's music but did not know anything about their story so that is my perspective. I was absolutely hooked from episode one. Michael Shannon really makes you feel the undying love and passion come out of the screen and practically smack you in the face. Jessica Chastain is as perfect as she always is and you never stop loving the character even when you don't exactly like what she is doing. Same is said for Shannon's performance.,/review/rw8784028/?ref_=tt_urv
