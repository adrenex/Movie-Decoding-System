2 July 2014,A_Different_Drummer,9," rare entertainment, no pretentiousness, no agenda, only pure film-making
","As a sports film (of which there are many each year, mostly in the B-genre, most you will never hear about) this little gem has more in common with Eastwood's Gran Torino. In other words -- oh this sounds so cliché, but sometimes only a cliché will suffice -- this really isn't a film about winning, or a film about running, but a film about life. Life. The one sport we all have in common. The one sport we compete in each day, whether we want to or not. The 4-minute mile becomes a metaphor for merely living your life with integrity, with impeccability. With its sights set so high, this would be such an easy film to mess up. The balance is so delicate. Heavy-handed direction would make the viewer feel manipulated, or ""Disneyed."" And too light a touch would miss the mark completely. Canadian director Charles-Olivier Michaud, with very few credits in features, simply nails it. I mean nails it. Pitch perfect direction. About as far from Michael Bay and the Transformers as the Earth is from the Moon. And the cast is uniformly excellent, especially veteran warhorse Richard Jenkins -- who steals his scenes so subtly you don't realize it until the film is over -- and Analeigh Tipton, who has to simultaneously be provocative enough to attract a boy who wasn't looking for a relationship in the first place, yet practical enough to cement that relationship as the seismic tremors in the script come one after another. A gem. A perfect gem.",/review/rw3065128/?ref_=tt_urv

",4 Minute Mile is a plodding unoriginal drama although it does make a reference to The Karate Kid at one point.,/review/rw3065128/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film tells the story of a young man who takes up running as a way to get a college scholarship, so he can leave the undesirable social situation he is in.",/review/rw3065128/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2014,intelearts,8," 570th Review: Instant Classic: Kid's Gotta Run. Has-been Trainer, Good Drama, Great Sport
","Who doesn't love a good inspirational sports movie? In One Square Mile we both get and then get beyond the standard clichés of the sports genre to a very good film about running. This is a film with well-judged pace, it doesn't rush and yet, we were absolutely hooked.",/review/rw3065128/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2015,wow88,2," Not an original moment to be found.
",How does this type of drivel get made? Who sits down and decides to create something so cliché? Every single character was a cliché. Who enjoys this kind of predictability? Couldn't the writer have come up with even one original character? Maybe this is the world of talentless cookie cutter people that surrounds him. None of the relationships in the film would ever exist because people just don't behave this way to each other. Someone explain why he would listen to his brother when he acted like that? When coach said wax on wax off was the most enjoyable moment because I had been saying it to myself the entire film and I found something to laugh about. If you want to see a much better version of this film watch the Jerico Mile with the amazing Peter Strauss.,/review/rw3065128/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2014,TxMike,," Smaller independent film of a runner with inner demons.
","We were able to watch this movie on Netflix streaming. From the brief description I figured I would like, and I found it to be even better than my expectations.",/review/rw3065128/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2014,MaryS-333,7," 4 Minute Mile Wows Audiences at the Seattle International Film Festival
","I attended the world premier of 4 Minute Mile, directed by Charles-Olivier Michaud, at the Seattle International Film Festival. I chose to see the film, not only because it was filmed in Seattle, but also because the storyline sounded compelling. The film proved to be more than compelling; it was shocking, gritty, and suspenseful. ",/review/rw3065128/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2014,dansview,7," Slow but Effective
",Yes there were the standard clichés of high school underdog athlete from the wrong side of town. But there were enough fine qualities to this film to overcome stereotypes of the genre.,/review/rw3065128/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2020,zutterjp48,7," A good story of sport and self-improvement.
","Drew Jacobs lives really a hard life, he lost his father, he lives in poverty and besides has to make illegal runs for his brother Wes.He has been expulsed from the university relay team.Other side Coleman is observing all the competitions and has noticed that Drew has a talent for running a one-mile distance.At the beginning Drew suffers very much, because Coleman gives him hard duties, running in the water, looking for a tire under the water.But Coleman wants to show him what means patience and tenacity.Besides this hard training Drew met Lisa, a student who practices also athletics and they become first friends (he got a black eye for definding her in her birthday cerebration) and fall in love together.
A good story about patience, tenacity and self improvement.
About performances, Richard Jenkins no needs any presentation, he is really a very good actor,Kelly Blatz is excellent in his role of Drew and Analeigh Tipton is also excellent in her role of Lisa.",/review/rw3065128/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2018,nogodnomasters,6," WAX ON. WAX OFF.
","The movie was originally titled ""One Square Mile"" which made more sense than PLOT SPOILER ""4 Minute Mile"" as no one actually runs a four minute mile in this film. Drew Jacobs (Kelly Blatz) likes to run, his dad OD, his brother (Cam Gigandet) deals drugs, although not very good at it, and mom (Kim Basinger) tolerates it all.",/review/rw3065128/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2019,davyd-02237,5," Unsure if a True Story!
","It isn't made clear in the version that I saw that this is a true story....the runner comes from a family with a ""low life brother"" who has even ""lower life friends"" and a mother who seems very distant. His coach spends most of the film ""in a bottle"" and the drama of the ""tragedy"" only comes with 9 minutes of the film remaining. I don't see much in this to entertain given that's its unclear if the ""hero"" of the film actually really achieves anything in life. If you have other things to do, it may be better than watching this, although to be fair to Ms Basinger she still looks great heading into 60years of age",/review/rw3065128/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2014,cumberbatchv,7," Unexpected
","I anticipated this being a typical, high school sports movie and was geared up for that sort of simple entertainment. Some aspects remained typical: conflict in the protagonists' life stemmed from family, some sort of important death would occur that would make him want to win more, and that the protagonist had a bit of a temper. HOWEVER, the two major unexpected aspects of this film is what pushed me to give it a 7 and not a 5, which I rate as a film that's just average in all ways. ",/review/rw3065128/?ref_=tt_urv
