26 August 2011,ferguson-6,7," What's wrong with you?
","Greetings again from the darkness. This one has been on my radar since the Sundance Festival and all the raves about Elizabeth Olsen's performance. After attending a screening last evening, I find myself at a loss to adequately describe not just her stunning turn, but also this unusual film from writer/director Sean Durkin.",/review/rw2719987/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2019,rooprect,9," The most boring thriller ever made... and I loved it.
","Even the title ""Martha Marcy May Marlene"" is so boring that most thriller audiences will fall asleep before they finish reading it. But before you click away in search of Saw IX, consider this question: Which is more powerful, a bunch of quick forgettable shocks, or a slow intensifying charge that builds up over 102 minutes? M.M.M.M. definitely takes the latter approach, slowly seeping under your skin, never quite giving you the cathartic release of a good zap, but overall delivering just as much power as any popcorn-spilling slasher, but in a very different way.",/review/rw2719987/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2011,howard.schumann,8," Character development is not one of the film's strong points
","In first time director Sean Durkin's Martha Marcy May Marlene, Martha (Elizabeth Olsen), a young woman in her early twenties joins a commune in a wooded area in upstate New York and endures psychological and sexual abuse at the hands of charismatic leader Patrick (John Hawkes). Patrick is a Charles Manson look-alike, who calls Martha ""Marcy May"" (all women must use the name ""Marlene"" when answering the phone). Nothing is said about the reason the commune exists or what its philosophy may be, other than Patrick's misinterpretation of the Buddhist word ""Nirvana"", and his remark that death is but a continuation, not an end. We are not told the circumstances that led Martha to join the group, but we do know that her parents are deceased, and that her relationship with her older sister Lucy (Sarah Paulson) has been strained.",/review/rw2719987/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2013,phd_travel,4," Unsatisfying and disappointing despite a strong performance
",It is a fascinating subject for a movie to see the after effects on a member of a cult. Elizabeth Olsen acts as the title's Martha who escapes from an upstate cult and stays with her sister played by Sarah Paulson and her husband.,/review/rw2719987/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2012,itamarscomix,6," Tons of potential
","I'm tempted to give Martha Marcy May Marlene a higher rating than it deserves for what it could have been, not for what it is. It boasts two young talents who are showing tons of potential - director Sean Durkin and lead actress Elizabeth Olsen; Olsen's performance is subtle and effective, and Durkin's directorial work creates a strong sense of atmosphere, which is aided by the superb cinematography of Jody Lee Lipes (who also had very little prior experience in feature length films). It's a film that looks and sounds great, but unfortunately it doesn't mesh into a satisfying experience.",/review/rw2719987/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2011,DonFishies,8," Should be retitled ""A Star is Born""
","Moments after the credits began, I knew Elizabeth Olsen was destined for the Oscar red carpet for her work in Martha Marcy May Marlene. It was a quiet thriller I knew very little about content wise before hand, but knew all about the acclaim it has received since premiering at Sundance and Cannes earlier this year. When it came to the Toronto International Film Festival, it was one of the first films I clamoured for tickets for. And now I know why.",/review/rw2719987/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2011,deproduction,8," Ending, like the rest of the film, is perfect
","Don't read this if you haven't seen the film yet. Don't read any of these, just go see it! Though unresolved endings are nothing new in film, the abrupt ending to Martha Marcy May Marlene is one of the most apropos uses of an ambiguous ending I've ever seen. The film is designed to leave the viewer in the same state of mind as the title character throughout, wondering if we're experiencing the present or the past, dream or reality. The point of the ending is that the fear, instability, and un-easiness isn't going to fade for Martha. Her experience will not be wrapped-up nicely in some storybook ending, but will continue to haunt her for the rest of her life. She will always live in fear that her world is going to be ripped apart. Other comments have asked about the car at the end, the identity of the bartender, the appearance of Patrick at the lake, and I'm sure the Director could ask for nothing more than for them to be confused. Martha herself doesn't know the answers, and neither should the viewer. My personal opinion is that Martha imagined Patrick at the lake, the car at the end was just odd happenstance, and maybe even the SUV she damaged was unrelated to the Cult, but Martha is going to question those and countless other events for the rest of her life. She'll never hear creaks or rattles the same again... she'll never sleep soundly and consistently... she'll never trust her view of reality, and that's exactly the point of the ending. Great performances, great direction, great movie!",/review/rw2719987/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2011,tappingjeff,8," More Than Meets the Eye
","Sean Durkin's first feature is quite the trip. Durkin's sensibility as a director shines with this film, and shows undeniable promise. The really crazy thing about this film is that it's quietness is only juxtaposed by the really messed up things that are happening in the plot. An intriguing analytical mess of reality, memory, and fantasy, Martha Marcy May Marlene is about a paranoia, an extreme desire to escape the past, though it always comes back to haunt you. It is the isolation and the trouble that comes with that, that Martha really suffers from-- the cult has a certain way of thinking and the film geniously explores the psychological persuasion into a way of thinkingthe way that the cult tries to make their ethics and morality universal is a terrifying, and intriguing thing. Elizabeth Olsen does a helluva job as Martha, giving her dewey eyed complexity, both bewilderment, shock, disgust, and intrigue. She gives quiet moments great momentum, and is an actress to keep an eye on. Jody Lee Lipes' cinematography is eerily distant and then uncomfortably close; the mixed bag reflects Martha's psyche in an interesting way. The scariest thing about Martha Marcy May Marlene is that it actually could happen. It may have even benefited from taking that dive a bit further, let us know just how paranoid and altered Martha is, and especially contrasting that with the old Martha, and the only complaint I might have is that we never get to see what the original Martha was like; it is only inferred as to why she would even accept and join this group in the first place, or what exactly she was running away from. But perhaps that makes the film only more intriguing—running away brought her to this society, and of course it looks fine on the outside, with it's acceptable living conditions and always a ""family' of sorts around you. But, ah, there's always more than meets the eye. B+",/review/rw2719987/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2011,napierslogs,8," Martha, Marcy May, and Marlene all caught between truth, sanity and madness
","Martha (Elizabeth Olsen) is a character who has forgotten what it means to be normal. Marcy May is a character who has been taught to ignore social values and any definition of ""normal."" Martha and Marcy May is the same person and that's where the conflict lies. ""Martha Marcy May Marlene"" is a dramatic character study which edges towards psychological thriller.",/review/rw2719987/?ref_=tt_urv

7 June 2012,rebecca-ry,6," Not Great

17 December 2014,SnoopyStyle,7," good surprising performance
",Martha (Elizabeth Olsen) escapes from an abusive male-dominated communal cult where she lived as Marcy May. Her sister Lucy (Sarah Paulson) eagerly takes her in. Lucy is married to Ted (Hugh Dancy). She has difficulties reintegrating into the world despite her sister's efforts. The movie flashes back occasionally to her time with the charismatic leader Patrick (John Hawkes).,/review/rw2719987/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2018,bbewnylorac,5," Self indulgent and disappointing
","There is plenty of potential in this movie. Great cinematography, good acting and an interesting plot about a young woman who lives with her sister after leaving a cult. It just moves too slowly. As a viewer, it's frustrating to have to sit through glacially sluggish, pretty shots of the actors staring out a window or across a lake. It's annoying. I guess they think it's poetic or artistic but - hello!!! - remember the audience?? Here we are! Often the sound, also, is poor. You can hardly hear the dialogue because they're going for some pretentious mood. But you miss entire chunks of conversations.The music, also, is overdone and intrusive. The movie needs more drive. Maybe a therapist for Martha? But sadly the director seems more intent on making everyone and everything look pretty than creating a dynamic and powerful film. Which this could easily have been.",/review/rw2719987/?ref_=tt_urv

","Woman escapes from cult and fears reprisals from remaining cult members. There's your premise. So many endless, exciting possibilities for what a writer could do with such a premise, and yet what we are presented with is this: Martha Marcy May Marlene, which may as well have been called ""Oh my god, you're not middle class anymore"".",/review/rw2719987/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2011,chaos-rampant,," Bad kundalini rising
","This is an exercise in controlled emotional damage, channelling oblique hurt and social condemnation from Haneke, or softened from Bruno Dumont. It plays well for a debut, a studied work referencing 3 Women and Bergman's Glass Darkly among others, the result a carefully tuned psychologic thriller, but raises a few questions along the way.",/review/rw2719987/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2012,BookSplotReviews,7," Weird, but in a Good Way
","Elizabeth Olsen's acting in Martha Marcy May Marlene is really fantastic (it may or may not be her first feature film, not sure which she did first this or Silent House). Her acting combined with the background we get make it easy to see how someone could be drawn into a cult - and stay for so long despite the abusiveness.",/review/rw2719987/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2012,nik-w-1,2," Great idea in theory, not so great in practice.

14 October 2011,bowieec,2," The acting was fine - given the horrid script.
","This film was AWFUL. I have never seen so many clichés in one film. This was a movie about cults that apparently has never read an article or seen another, better, film about cults. Just to keep it alliterative, I wish they'd added ""Manson"" to the title - because it could've been on a lateral plane with that cult. A woman exiting the screening looked at me and said ""I've never seen a cult that boring -- why did she wait so long to leave?"" It really was every 70's cliché you've ever seen (and not missed). The audience all started laughing half-way through the screening. It was in NO WAY about the actors. They were all pretty good. It was the script -- so hacky and horrid. And the consensus is that the Olsen sister (who is a fine up and coming actress) looks like the love-child of Maggie Gyllenhaal and Scarlett Johansson. That's not a bad thing -- just distracting. We all like Sarah Paulson - but she's been given the most unbelievable lines of anyone. When someone acts COMPLETELY PSYCHOTIC several times and you keep saying ""Why are you acting like this? What the hell is wrong with you?"" and you still resist getting that person treatment - well, it's your own fault what will happen... Overall there was not one surprise plot-wise in the entire film - just lots of the audience heaving heavy sighs from watching an unintelligible bad decision and giggles from seeing the cliché ""cult"" dialogue between the demagogue and the unfortunate female victim. And the Helter-Skelter house robbery - ridiculous. I have never left before the Q&A at a screening -- until tonight. My only question would have been: Did you read the script? Then why did you do this movie???? Awful.",/review/rw2719987/?ref_=tt_urv

","Martha Marcy May Marlene continuously cuts back and forth between past and present. However, the audience could have used a lot more past and a bit more present to help understand more about Martha (Elizabeth Olsen). The past shows Martha's introduction to a reclusive cult deep in the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York. The present reveals it is two years later, Martha has decided to escape the cult, and shacks up with her sister and brother-in-law in an upscale Connecticut lakeside community.",/review/rw2719987/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2014,paul2001sw-1,8," Socialisation and de-socialisation
","'Martha Marcy May Marlene' is a powerful drama about a young woman who flees a cult-ish community under the domain of a charismatic, abusive alpha male. She takes refuse with her estranged sister: but the latter is wealthy, a control-freak, determined to make the world around her fit her perfect image, whereas her new house guest is paranoid, nervous, provocative and highly de-socialised. The strength of the film is that in many ways, the host is not a particularly likable person, but nonetheless, the film forces you to see her point of view: that her sister is not someone she can care for in the abstract, but neither bear to be around nor actually help. The movie is not wildly unorthodox but it quite skilfully implies the disquiet and distorted perspective of its primary protagonist without forsaking either subtlety or the capacity to induce sympathy, right up to the disturbingly ambiguous final scene.",/review/rw2719987/?ref_=tt_urv
