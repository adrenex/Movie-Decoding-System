4 November 2004,Coventry,8," Subtle, genuinely creepy and ... SUBTLE
","The Others is a very remarkable film from more than just one viewpoint. In an era where you can only impress young horror fanatics with bucket-loads of blood and gross-out effects, Amenábar actually re-teaches his audience that fear is especially caused by suggestion and the absence of explicit images. The Others is the first intelligent horror film in years, completely relying on atmosphere and eerie set pieces. It's such a relief to finally see a subtle film that is also effective! I'm normally not much of Nicole Kidman fan but she's very convincing as the prudish, over-concerned mother who desperately tries to protect her children from the outside world (daylight in particular). She lives in a remote mansion and waits, along with her 2 children, for WWII to be over. With the arrival of 3 servants, strange events star to occur in the old house and the daughter spots 'intruders' everywhere. The screenplay - by Amenábar himself - is not totally unique (filmfreaks who're familiar with expressionism highlights from the 60's will quickly guess the hidden plot twist) but it's filled with ingenious findings and sublime dialogues. The Others reminds you of 'The Innocents' and there are far worse films to get compared with, if you ask me! What also is rather amazing about this production is that Amenábar seems so confident! This is his first giant Hollywood adventure with stars in the cast and American money and yet he has total control over everything. The acting is great, the plot actually scares you and the directing is solid. The Others is a total winner and easily one of the greatest genre-films of the last few decades.",/review/rw4958303/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2021,Sleepin_Dragon,10," A masterpiece.
","Twenty years on, and The Others still rates as one of the best, most memorable horrors of the last two decades. It doesn't have the cheap gore or lazy scares that so many do, this has the element of menace, the scares are more measured, and suitably placed.",/review/rw4958303/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2018,Kirpianuscus,," remarkable
","After each occasion when I saw it, I define it as masterpiece. sure, many explanations. but something is real impressive - the plot. the science to explore each emotion, expectation, thrill, supposition about story, characters and end. the performances are more than beautiful. the atmosphere - you feel it . the tension - real embroidery. the great good point - it is a film about yourself. about fears, certitudes and appearances. and that does it a magnificent film. and more. a remarkable masterpiece.",/review/rw4958303/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2005,nycritic,10," They Are Here, Invisible, but Here.
","The Stewart household is a strange one. An isolated house in the Isle of Jersey, it's constantly enveloped in thick, blue fog, all doors must remain closed, and drapes block the sunlight because the children suffer from an illness in which they are extremely sensitive to it. Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman, finally coming to her own in a story worthy of her talents), wakes up one morning screaming from what may have been a nightmare. Three strangers arrive to the house and they tell Grace they are replying for her request for domestic help -- and almost immediately, though subtly, strange events begin happening and it slowly becomes clear that there are other unseen, unwanted people occupying their quarters. This only becomes more evident when Grace discovers, to her horror, that these servants are more than what they seem to and that her own reality is not what she believes it to be.",/review/rw4958303/?ref_=tt_urv

10 August 2001,mercybell,10," A Beautiful Drama Entangled in Intense Thrills and Chills
","It's funny that I see this movie the way I do, perhaps I'm more perceptive to little dramatic, human touches, but I saw this movie and was satisfied with it. In fact, I fell in love with it. This movie is chilling, very spooky, with a few moments that will make you jump, but it's a movie that works itself up, and by the end of the movie you feel scared, and like someone has zapped you a few times, chilly from inside out, but fulfilled.",/review/rw4958303/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2007,cosmic_quest,9," Horror at its best
","At a time when horror films constitute silly teenagers blindly wandering into danger and unnecessary gore, 'The Others' is like a breath of fresh air. It goes back to the roots of the horror genre, employing an eerie atmosphere and mysterious characters to conjure the chilly backbone of the film.",/review/rw4958303/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2004,FilmOtaku,7," A throwback to the great spooky Gothic films
","Rarely does a scary film come around that isn't schlocky and obvious. 'The Others', directed by the great Alejandro Amenabar (Abre los Ojos) is a stylish, spooky and fun film to watch that doesn't cheapen itself like so many in the genre. It is 1947 on the island of Jersey in England, and Grace (Nicole Kidman) is the mother of two small children, Charles (Christopher Eccleston) and Anne (Alakina Mann) who are allergic to the sunlight, so they are not allowed to go outside. Moreover, any room they are in has to be locked with the curtains shut, a cumbersome task in their mansion with its 50 doors. Mysteriously, the mansion's staff left the week before, which precipitates the arrival of three new servants; a gardener and two housekeepers who are promptly hired. Further complicating matters is the fact that Anne keeps talking to an unseen child, and unexplained footsteps, opened curtains and doors opening and shutting are starting to wear thin on the already uber-fragile Grace, until the occurrences threaten their lives.",/review/rw4958303/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is one of the best movies I have seen all year, and one of the top horror stories ever told.  It's creepy, simplistic, and eerie.",/review/rw4958303/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2001,SteveMadcow,10," ""THE OTHERS is a creepy film... that reminded me of an old 40s or 50s ghost story.""
","The Others is yet another in a long list of great horror movies of the new millennium. I have always loved ghost stories, and this film has easily become my favorite ghost story ever. It's like one of the great old black and white ghost stories but better. It takes you on a slow, and uncomfortable ride.",/review/rw4958303/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2001,BermudezLievano,10," Perfect.... a master at work
","Alejandro Amenábar is a very young and talented director, born in Chile and raised in Spain. He revolutionized Spanish cinema when he arrived on the scene with Thesis, at only 24 years of age. The came Abre los ojos, a very powerful second film that immediately put him aside some of the leading directors there, like Pedro Almodóvar, Carlos Saura, or Fernando Trueba. The others is only his third film and you can now see a hint of who may become one of the best around in a couple of years (he's only 29).",/review/rw4958303/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2006,Vincentiu,10," Before the death, inside the illusion
","What is the death? What is the fear who make this sleep a huge problem? This movie do not presents a way to understand the future life or the secret of another world. This film talk about the knowledge and the innocence. About an inside solitude and the words of this empty space. Grace Steward is the perfect mother and a perfect wife. But his perfection is his fundamental sin. The fear and the waiting, the love and the sacrifice spirit. Like the Old Lady she believes in the reality and must protect his personal world of the dangerous contacts. The house is a grave, but his silence is the honest price for live. The rooms are cells but this is only way to save the essential. The sick of children is a wall for a good protection. Bertha Mills and his companions are not only the enemy, guides or strangers. They are the end of waiting. The killers of the Grace's reality. The death is yours master piece. And the verdict- a word of children's lesson.",/review/rw4958303/?ref_=tt_urv

",Can't say much without it spoiling the movie! Rating 9 because a lot of it moved a bit slowly but I guess that was all for a reason!,/review/rw4958303/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2005,Theo Robertson,7," Rather Effective
","I watched THE OTHERS simply because Christopher Eccleston in it , a future DOCTOR WHO in a scary movie , now this I've got to see , but to be honest Eccleston's role is little more than cameo while the always consistent Nicole Kidman isn't the real star of the movie - It's writer/director Alejandro Amenabar ",/review/rw4958303/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2004,Manthorpe,8," Fairly decent and original concept.
","I'll have to admit that I put off watching this movie despite being told by several friends that it was pretty good and worth checking out. That's mostly because ""scary"" movies usually turn out to be nothing but crap riddled, cheap thrill fests with terrible acting by actors just looking for their next handout...not to mention directors that care nothing about the progress of their careers. That and the slew of B- horror/thriller movies that seemed to come out very close together along with this movie made me a little apprehensive. However, I was pleasantly surprised.",/review/rw4958303/?ref_=tt_urv

27 June 2019,pokemon_trainer_lucas,9," A fantastic film that sends shivers down your spine
","With this film having an age rating of 12, it would serve as a fantastic film for a child/teens first horror film. The plot is simple but effective, the climax is chilling, and there are scenes throughout that will send shivers down your spine no matter how many horror movies you've seen before! This film will fill you with intrigue and tension. I highly recommend it!",/review/rw4958303/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2021,pawanpunjabithewriter,6," The most shocking and suspenseful movie I have watched all my life
","I have to dislike it since it has scared me so much I'm pottying for the second time in 30 minutes. If you wanna be scared like that, watch this movie TILL THE END. If you don't wanna trouble yourself and stay in peace get the hell out of this movie and never think of watching it again. I got so scared, I started this movie at 11.50 PM in the night and I'm done with it at almost 2 in the midnight. It can't get any scarier than this. The scariest part I'm referring to isn't the whole movie, however, I don't wanna create any spoilers for you. Take care and love your loved ones more.",/review/rw4958303/?ref_=tt_urv

31 October 2002,StreepFan126,10," Should have been Nicole kidman's Oscar nominated role
","For the year 2001, Nicole Kidman recieved an Oscar nomination for her role in the very overrated movie ""Moulin Rouge.""  I thought that her performance in this ghost thriller was by far one of the best performances I have ever seen that year.  It reminded me of Ellen Burstyn's performance in ""The Exorcist.""  In fact, the entire film was greatly overlooked at the Academy Awards.  A must for your Halloween library!",/review/rw4958303/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2001,overthetop10,10," Nicole Kidman rules!
","If I had to sum up this movie in a word, it would be ""chilling.""  The Others is a delightfully atmospheric suspense film.  It's tense, scary, and very memorable -- I don't think I'll ever forget the image of a terrified Nicole Kidman clutching her rosary beads around her shotgun as she tears down the halls of her dreadful Victorian mansion.",/review/rw4958303/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2005,Kyle007,9," What a twist!!! Scary to the last moments, specially at the last moments
","First of all, i have to say that this year (2001) is the one that established Nicole Kidman as a superstar, she was an ""A"" actress, but here she became ""A+"", first and mainly with Moulin Rouge and then with this superb movie, i have to say that i saw a few people who gave this great movie a 10, i rate it with a 10 only because there is nothing higher, but i'm sure it deserves a lot of credit.",/review/rw4958303/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2014,ma-cortes,8," Creepy movie builds taut by showing virtually eerie images , unsettling score and evocative cinematography
","Thrilling and surprising story full of chills , plot twists , intrigue and excitement . The movie opens with Nicole Kidman, in voice-over, reading a story. She begins with the words, ""Now children, are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin."" As a woman named Grace Stewart who lives in a darkened old house with her two photosensitive (it is very strange with roughly a thousand people in the world that have it) children (the disease they have is an actual disease known as Xeroderma Pigmentosum). Grace , whose husband (Christopher Eccleston) has never returned from the war , becomes convinced that her family home (the house - supposedly on the island of Jersey - is actually located in the north of Spanish , in Las Fraguas , Cantabria , Palace of Hornillos) haunted while overprotecting her two young children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley were cast after an intensive search that encompassed 5,000 children). They will live alone there with oppressive, rare and almost religious rules , until she needs to hire a group of servants (Eric Sykes as Mr. Edmund Tuttle , Elaine Cassidy as Lydia and Fionnula Flanagan as Mrs. Bertha Mills) for them .",/review/rw4958303/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2019,UniqueParticle,9," Nicole Kidman is bombtasticly awesome!
","""Sometimes the world of the living gets mixed up with the world of the dead."" - great line! The scary thing about this movie is I believe in ghosts, and strange thumping sounds can really happen without anyone around. Such a great story that's perfection with scariness and I was happy to see Christopher Eccleston in it. So rare for Nicole Kidman to be in the horror genre, and damn her performance is outstanding! I usually watch more intense horror so it's nice to see something that's not graphic and gratuitous!",/review/rw4958303/?ref_=tt_urv
