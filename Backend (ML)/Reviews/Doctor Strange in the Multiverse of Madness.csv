24 April 2022,KOOLAIDBRO,8," Brits just know how to make entertainment
","I'm a red blooded American from Missouri and the strangest thing happened to me when I saw the film Shaun of the Dead. I went down the rabbit hole of British TV and movies and came out a better person. Life is doom and gloom in on the telly *as the Brits say* in America 24/7 on a loop and it is exhausting. These kind of shows you can just turn on and have a good time. It doesn't shy away from serious issues, but it takes them on differently than American TV and that is why British TV for the win. If you like British TV you'll like this. If you don't wtf are you watching it for?",/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2021,nkishudak,10," Better than expected
","Why is this so underrated? It has great humor, drama, acting and storyline. Unique. Love it. I was expecting a typical British comedy, but got so much more.",/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2021,CrazyArty,7," Fresh British ""comedy"" ... enjoyable
",A novel comedy from Stephen Merchant in which a group of seven very different strangers complete community service together in Bristol.,/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2021,kris-gray,10," Brillliant
",Some reviewers here think a comedy drama is supposed to have funny lines ever 30 seconds. Thankfully it didn't I could have done without a canned laughter track. It's the situations that are comedic not so much the lines.,/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2022,Rogermex,9," Very cool and well done.
","This was such a pleasure. Of course, I'd watch anything with Christopher Walken in it, and he's typically fun here too. Amazingly fine acting by all involved. You find yourself caring for each of the characters, even if some seemed ""weirdos."" Good combination of clever humor and serious social issues, as well as personal drama. Seriously, I can't think of anything wrong with it. Have a ball!",/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2022,efd-10467,7," Good relaxing fun
","This is a very pleasant show, it is a good change to all the hardcore action, sex and drama on modern TV.",/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2022,smartinezmd,10," Withdrawal Symptoms
",I know that a series is really good when I feel sad that the last episode has ended. The characters have endeared themselves into my home and my heart. A very well done Brit comedy/drama/suspense with great writing and acting. Fun premise as well.,/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2021,Almost_Soldout,10," Light but bright Satire
","Unexpectedly a great show! Perfect cast, well developed characters and a nice plot with quite a few funny twists happening. Actually the storylines aren't the most important here, it's about people and how their such a different lives crossing with each other.",/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2021,fluffy2560,8," Back to a simpler time...
",People have said this show is not very good but perhaps they are looking at it the wrong way.,/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2021,gethinnadin,9," Uplifting, funny and entertaining
","After the first episode I wasn't sure, but this turned into a real gem. Funny, heartwarming and a love letter to Bristol. By the last episode I was smiling and throughly enjoyed this.",/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2021,robcallawayvfr,9," As a Bristolian I love it!
","I hate my accent and generally I don't enjoy hearing it on the TV or Radio. This could be that it is either put on by a non local actor, over exaggerated or automatically makes you think of Aardman's Creature Comforts.",/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2021,argylx,9," Brilliant dramedy
","Having read some other reviews complaining they didn't get as many laughs as they were expecting, I'd like to clarify; The Outlaws is not a sitcom. It is a dramedy or comedy-drama. I think people have seen Merchant's name, thought of The Office and Extras and thus misunderstood the idea behind this series.",/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2021,degrees-33365,9," Brilliant cast and writing
",This...is brilliant!,/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2021,kerrielmarsh,8," Walken and a Kool Gang
",Who doesn't love a group of misfits that are not really badies but a little bit naughty.,/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2021,RobCattani,9," Christopher Walken, it's only Christopher Walken!
","Absolutely brilliant in the first two episodes ,acting and story is bang on ,all characters are likeable , especially the shop lifting Rani ,superbly played by Rhianne Barreto ,a mix of hilarious comedy and nail biting drama ,Merchant as ever has delivered , and it has Christopher effing Walken in it ,one of the greatest actors in history ....
Genius.",/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv

9 November 2021,loisjclark,9," Sharp, Entertaining & Amusing
","Very enjoyable, easy-to-watch comedy.",/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2021,ianlouisiana,8," Comedy/Drama ;- a neat rick of you can pull it off.
","I thought the first episode was terrific,fast - paced,funny with interesting characters and numerous sub - plots that would presumably develop over the series.",/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2022,msghall,9," Mostly wonderful, sometimes preachy but always a bit funny
","This is a rich series with sharp direction, engaging script and a decent group of actors. The key of course is Stephen Merchant's dialog with its wit and humanity.",/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2021,dwhyde-91116,8," Decent well executed with laughs series
",The 1st ep might be a bit on the slow side while setting up what's in store with the following eps.,/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2021,timothy-price-794-581328,10," Brilliant miniseries. Kudos to all involved.
","Superbly written drama that manages to balance a story with surprisingly dark tones, with real heart and also a lot of comedy coming from the really well developed and diverse characters, who also surprise with their depth. A lot of programmes try to balance real drama and comedy, rarely achieved this well.",/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2022,talkteav,10," The Outlaws is a motley crew that offers you touching moments of hope for humanity.
","The Outlaws is a story that while topical, will still allow you to escape, laugh, and offer you touching moments of hope for humanity. It can feel a little slow, but the character backgrounds keep the story interesting, leaving you with a desire to see what happens next. The showrunners did a great job telling a traditional story about personal struggles with relatable characters and issues. My favorite character is John Halloran (Darren Boyd), who kept my fingers crossed, praying that he would do the right thing in each episode. The talented ensemble delivers a perfect atmosphere of drama only to have each actor offer you some form of perfectly timed comedic relief. I'm looking forward to a second season and more of Christopher Walken's mischievous smile.",/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2022,bosporan,8," Complex comedy with a human face.
","An original and intriguing concept from the warped, but brilliant mind of Stephen Merchant. Low level criminals from wide-ranging walks of life are uncomfortably smashed together in a Bristol based community service project.",/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2021,mail-228-654999,10," Absolutely brilliant
","Great set up - with a fantastic cast thrown together by circumstances. The first two episodes do some background to why a few of them are there or what their issues are and also mixes in a lot of cracking gags Each of them has stuff to deal with, some more difficult (or indeed hazardous) than others and I can't wait to see how they get on.",/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2021,philadams-98723,9," Just incredible & must watch tv!
",The first episode is just hilarious & laugh out loud! There are also many thought provoking back stories & some heart felt moments. There is also superb acting & really great characters. The writers have really hit the jackpot here. This show has cult following all over it. Just think it would have been perfect at half hour instead of 1hour though. Highly recommended!,/review/rw7481106/?ref_=tt_urv
