11 August 2021,Ed-Shullivan,8," My own fantasies have changed over the past 44 years since Fantasy Island was first aired in 1977. I am enjoying this new TV version.
","As Roselyn Sanchez states ""Most people don't understand there is a difference between a fantasy and a miracle."" Some of the other IMDB reviewers are obviously looking for a miracle, or simply just miss the 1977 TV version with Tattoo's (Herv√© Villechaize) famous line ""Boss 'da plane, 'da plane!""",/review/rw7366360/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2021,marymcfarland-01866,5," Based in the Pilot
","I liked this. I'm not understanding the ""1"" reviews. I watched the original as a kid in the 70s. It was always a program that addressed what you think your fantasy is, might not actually be your fantasy. Both then and now, this show required some huge suspension of disbelief. I think the reboot captured all of that. I like the reference at the very beginning to the forever awesome Ricardo Montalban. The newscaster story was a bit disjointed, because of editing or something...I don't know. Anyway, I like the casting, the scenery, and the overall feel. It's worth a watch.",/review/rw7366360/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2022,bosporan,3," A remake too far
","Fantasy Island is simply not very good, a shadow of its impressive ancestor with dull stories, poor writing and wooden acting. A show to be robustly avoided.",/review/rw7366360/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2021,catfanatic888,6," A bit dull and boring
",I wanted to like this so much but I just can't. The cast is very talented and attractive but the storylines are mostly boring and stilted. I've watched every episode so much but only one or two stories really moved me! I hope they improve the storytelling soon or I'm afraid this show may be canceled.,/review/rw7366360/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2021,redinnevada,4," writing is HORRIBLE
","I've watched every episode. I WANT to love or at least like this show. I like the actors in it. All of them. The scenery is beautiful. The ""fantasies"" are interesting if a bit wacky, but even that's ok since it's supposed to be a bit fanciful. All those ingredients are the right ones.",/review/rw7366360/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2021,doug2go,2," Sorry - Doesn't Work for Me
","I was looking forward to the re boot - don't have a problem with shows the second time around and updated , Hawaii 5-0 was great , Magnum was great until the Doctor showed and ruined the show for me - but that isn't the reboot problem that is just brain dead writers and show runners, Fantasy island needed better more exciting stories , too much human interest stuff and family intrigues. It become mind numbingly boring after about 3 shows - if there was anything on TV I would have self cancelled but finally had enough after 15 minutes of the second to last show - I like Roselyn Sanchez but she is obviously mis cast in this roll and her side kick is an unnecessary 3rd wheel - in short they have made a mess of a great concept .",/review/rw7366360/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2021,grlym-46849,3," Great revival but more a show for a women
",The show is cute and charming,/review/rw7366360/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2021,jaccer11,3," Hallmark meets soap opera, not a good thing.
",Unfortunately they film this like a hallmark soap opera and that removes and imagination and originality. Acting and filming is subpar. Landscape is amazing though!,/review/rw7366360/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2021,JayPatton88,3," Grew up on the original series
",This series is no where close to being as good as the original series in every way. A complete letdown.,/review/rw7366360/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2021,rosanna-83335,5," Not really a show I recommend 5 episodes in. Maybe in a next season
","Never watched the original. Finding this show on the boring side. I sort of think it could get better with time. One thing I am having a lot of trouble with is the voice of Ruby the right hand. I don't know if it her real voice or if she is putting on an old persons voice, sorry if it is her natural voice, but got a feeling it is put on as in the first episode she was a client. She was 70 and dying of cancer and wanted to be young again then got to stay on so her voice being old sort of makes sense but I find it very annoying. On top of that I find her role pretty useless. She is just around and from time to time will have a mini conversation that frankly isn't that wow.",/review/rw7366360/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2021,arod_85,4," Boring and Pointless
","I loved Roselyn Sanchez in Devious Maids. The Grand Hotel was not nearly as strong as Devious Maids, however, it still was interesting and I was eager to watch the story unfold. I also love Bellamy. She knocked it out of the park in both Scandal and the Prodigal Son. I thought this would be along the caliber of Grand Hotel, but wasn't expecting it to be as strong as Devious Maids or Scandal. I was very wrong. This was completely boring. I finally made it through the first episode and it just felt completely pointless. There was nothing in the pilot to keep you interested and wanting to see another episode. I may try a few one more episode before fully giving it up, but I went ahead and wrote a review because the pilot was so unforgiving that I'm only wasting 15 more minutes of my life on the next episode. Fox needs to step it up. Nearly all shows over the last years have been duds with the exception of The Passage, which got canceled after one season.",/review/rw7366360/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2021,bangel3322,1," Boring
","Just watched the first episode and I didn't like it at all. I haven't seen the original series and so I can't compare it, but this was so flat and lifeless, I'm not interested to continue watching it. I thought it might be a little darker and mysterious like the 2020 film, even that was better than this. It's a shame Roselyn Sanchez's talent has been wasted on this show, she's a better actress than this.",/review/rw7366360/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2022,pearson1994,5," All focuses on women
","Someone commented in the reviews that this series is catered to women. Well I watched 6 episodes so far and yes, it is definitely all women. Men are props and women are all the focus. Not very much diversity since they all cater towards diversity.",/review/rw7366360/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2021,Bryyycers,1," This is a shallow empty version of an 80s classic.
","Another poorly structured shallow 1980s remake, needs more depth and meaning. I was hoping for something more uplifting being is based on as uplifting of a sore that's ever been made. But it is hallow and needlessly manipulative/cruel. Deeply disappointed in something that could had been great.",/review/rw7366360/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2021,ryan-l-leong,7," Updated 21st century version of the popular TV show from the 1980's

9 September 2021,abbylynn-20643,2," DRAB, BORING
","In the original fantasy Island, they had at least four or five stories and in the new fantasy Island.. they're only casting one story so short I yawn and so boring I flip it off.. we need to get back to the original fantasy Island stories and you need to get a new writer because it's not working out. Please fire the writer..",/review/rw7366360/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2021,lgtaylor22,2," You can't go home again
","Some series are just perfect for their place and time and there's no re-creating them. Fantasy Island is one of them. No mystery, no magic, no charm. Dull and boring attempt at a remake.",/review/rw7366360/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2021,dharmashantilove,1," Horrible!

26 September 2021,kerrydunn,1," No Fantasy Island would be a better title.
","Every single episode is a boring ""lets explore our real feelings"" or ""relive some childhood drama"" or ""group therapy"" session instead of fantasies.",/review/rw7366360/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2021,AnimatedCritic,4," Very Weird Show
","I didn't think Fantasy Island would already be rebooted after only a year, but her we are, with this weird show. The premise is basically that people go to Fantasy Island to live out their dreams. But the show is really confusing in a lot of ways. First, in the premiere episode, a couple never wishes to be younger, but they do. There's a lot of holes in the whole wish-making thing of this world. I also found this show to be really cringe, and some of the dialogue was really bad. And this is from a major TV network. I will give it points because it does stand out from most of the shows on FOX, and some of the visuals and backgrounds were breathtaking. The characters were pretty dull, and you just can't really relate to them. One thing I should point out is that this show tries to show commentary on how society expect women to be was handled poorly in my opinion. Anyways, there's a lot of holes in the plot, the characters are pretty bad, and the visuals and background are some of the best I've seen from FOX. IT does stand out among other shows, but it's still an confusing trip.",/review/rw7366360/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2021,CruelSummer1987,1," I can't even believe how bad
","I have watched 3 episodes, and would take it back if I could. Why keep watching? I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something. But it wasn't worth it. Filled with boring plots, episodes far too long with nothing happening and the WORST ACTING AND CASTING EVER of the supporting cast, this show is ROTTEN.",/review/rw7366360/?ref_=tt_urv
