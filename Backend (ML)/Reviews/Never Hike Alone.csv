2 May 2020,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,8," An MCU film that deserved better at the box office
","The Incredible Hulk, based on another marvel superhero and also the 1970s TV show, revolves around Bruce Banner becoming a fugitive after his science experiment exposes gamma radiation on him which transforms him into the Hulk which becomes his appearance for brief periods of time. Meanwhile, General Ross and his army including Emil Blonsky tracks down Bruce and little does he know that Emil decides to use a serum that would give him some abilities while also transforming him into an even worse creature imaginable.",/review/rw1888797/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2019,Oeuvre_Klika,8," An underrated part of MCU history
","As I am writing this review, Avengers: Endgame is breaking box-office records as the culmination of 11 years of the MCU. Marvel Studios has become a juggernaut that seemingly nothing can ever stop. When The Incredible Hulk came out in 2008, the second movie of the so-called « Phase 1 » after Iron Man, such a success was merely a hope, if it was envisaged at all.",/review/rw1888797/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2008,MovieAddict2016,7," A fun summer blockbuster
","In 2003, Ang Lee's Hulk was released to commercial success  breaking box office records for a June opening and smashing its way to the top of the box office, it outperformed many analysts' expectations and was well on its way to becoming one of the biggest comic book films ever produced.",/review/rw1888797/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2008,Aaron1375,8," Smashingly good fun.
","This movie was the second film to release that would set up the 2012 Avengers film. In retrospect, it was a bit of a mistake as it did underwhelming business at the box office; especially when you compare the box office take of this film and the first film to release, Iron Man. Why is it a mistake, well there was already a Hulk movie released only five years prior to this one and it too was a disappointment. That being said, this is the better film than the 2003 Ang Lee film, I just feel it released too soon after it. I think if that film had not existed, this one would have performed considerably better. Not the 300 plus Iron Man did, but perhaps a 200 million dollar film rather than making about the same amount as Ang Lee's film did. I also believe they tried to do a bit too much with the story, not that it is complex, just that they almost blend the comics, with the television show and the 2003 film. At the end of the 2003 film, Bruce is in South America, at the beginning of this one he is in Brazil...so it's a sequel? No, not at all. The origin that is shown during the credits alludes to the television show, but Hulk looks like the comics. Just too much and trying to appease too many people all at the same time. I also think Norton was poorly cast in this one, as I did not get a Banner vibe from him at all. He just does not seem like he is into the role and considering he did not opt into doing the Avengers film and beyond suggests that he was not into it.",/review/rw1888797/?ref_=tt_urv

12 June 2008,DICK STEEL,9," A Nutshell Review: The Incredible Hulk
","The crowded streets and cluttered housing on the streets of Rio De Janeiro provided some reminiscence of Jackie Chan's Police Story, where you could be sure of a chase scene zig- zagging the streets to take advantage of the wonderful opportunities presented for an exhilarating chase. And Leterrier doesn't try not to provide action junkies plenty of action- smashing moments as we root for Bruce Banner to hulk up, unfortunately of course, to satisfy our lust for some unadulterated action where everything in the way of the Hulk, gets smashed. However those expecting action from the get go will be disappointed, as there were only a small handful of action sequences, though of course they include the classic moments that comic fans had been baying for since 4 years ago. So I guess most will be left happy as we see some nifty moves by the Hulkster, which will leave a smile on your face, despite being used in limited doses. But I note though that the story cum action, looked a little bit like Superman II with the seeking of a cure and the deliberate loss of power to be with the lady love, and the duking out between super-beings on equal footing (here being gamma-powered), with a tinge of Cloverfield like moments too.",/review/rw1888797/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2008,brando647,8," An Incredible Reboot
","I was not one of those who hated Ang Lee's 2003 portrayal of the Hulk. I did enjoy it to an extent; it was a bit slow-moving and there were some parts that needed some improvement, but it was overall a decent film. I do agree that Louis Letterier's 2008 film was a vast improvement, though. It improved on all of the issues I had with Lee's film. The film is a reboot of the dying franchise: Bruce Banner has been hiding in Brazil, attempting to keep a low profile while he searches for a cure for his condition, but General Ross becomes aware of his location and enlists the aid of Emil Blonsky, a soldier with a mean streak. A bit of non-sanctioned experimentation later and Blonsky becomes a creature rivaling even the Hulk in power.",/review/rw1888797/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2009,Scarecrow-88,7," The Incredible Hulk
","Odd casting makes THE INCREDIBLE HULK, in my mind, an interesting feature film, a second attempt to right the wrongs of Ang Lee's HULK. Ultimately, as others in the past have mentioned, by the end, it turns into a video game duel between two monster titans with New York City(..a setting which seems to work quite well as a place where destruction occurs to such a devastating degree)the battleground as civilians, buildings, and transport vehicles are leveled in the process.",/review/rw1888797/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2008,Bunuel1976,7," THE INCREDIBLE HULK (Louis Leterrier, 2008) ***
","I recall disliking the overblown, gimmicky and far too somber HULK (2003); even if the creature’s leaping skills were a staple of the original comic (an animated series of which from the 1960s I used to watch as a kid), I found them especially silly in the live-action version – thankfully, here, they’re relegated to the very end. Anyway, when this was first announced, I had little faith that it would be any good: at first, I even doubted Edward Norton’s suitability for the lead but, seeing him in action as Dr. Bruce Banner, he brings the right elements of intelligence, paranoia, tenacity and anguish to the role (his relationship with Betty Ross – nicely played by the luscious Liv Tyler – is very moving, making for one of the more compelling couples in this type of film).",/review/rw1888797/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,bretttaylor-04022,6," It is a lot better than the 2003 one
","The first issue I have with this is it feels like there is a film missing. Is it a sequel to the Hulk or not, I still don't know. Its just there to introduce the Hulk to the MCU I feel. It is entertaining and never boring but it is far from spectacular.",/review/rw1888797/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2012,cherold,5," At least it's not as bad as the Ang Lee version
","With only the vaguest whiff of a story and a lack of character development even in Bruce Banner, the sort of tortured conflicted comic book character seemingly custom-made for character development, The Incredible Hulk really only has its special effects going for it. And while those are decent, a movie that is nothing but its special effects is not a movie.",/review/rw1888797/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2008,come2whereimfrom,7," Hulk smash-hit!
","From that brilliant poster of Ed Norton dressed all in denim walking away from the huge frame of his alter ego the Hulk to the superb end fight that shows the makers of Spiderman 3 how it should be done this is a great film. Not by any means a brilliant film but a truly enjoyable superhero romp none the less. Gone is the emotion that Ang Lee tried to inject into Hulk (2003) and back is the smashing and shouting and smashing. Plagued by his demons and his uncontrollable green counterpart, Norton plays Dr. Bruce Banner a scientist with a secret, desperate to find a cure. Hot on his heels are the army lead by Emil Blonsky (Roth) under the command of General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross, who just so happens to be the dad of Banners girlfriend Betty (Tyler), who wants to know how he gets all angry and use the technology to create 'super soldiers'. Plus Iron Man Tony Stark is in it. That then is about it, what you get is a chase movie with some great characters, some great effects and a couple of amazing set pieces including the end fight between the Hulk and the Abomination. All in all it's smashing stuff that should leave other superhero films green with envy.",/review/rw1888797/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2008,springsunnywinter,10," Monstrously Entertaining
","By the looks of the ending of Ang Lee's Hulk (2003) it seemed that there is going to be a sequel. After 5 years we now have The Incredible Hulk which is a reboot like Batman Begins. The reboot was a better idea than a sequel because Hulk (2003) wasn't a bad movie but wasn't even great either and was better off as a one film itself. But if the first attempt at a Hulk movie left you feeling a little green, good news! This version has a whole new cast, a whole new mood, and even a whole new retelling of The Hulk's origin",/review/rw1888797/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2019,Floated2,7," Much upgrade over the 2003 Hulk
","The Incredible Hulk starring Edward Norton is quite easily an upgrade over Ang Lee's Hulk released in 2003 for several reasons. Having watched both films right after one another, it is clear this version is superior.",/review/rw1888797/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2008,claudio_carvalho,7," Great and Entertaining Adventure
","Dr. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is secretly living in the greatest slum of South America, the Favela da Rocinha, and working in a factory of ""cachaça"" in Rio de Janeiro. While seeking the cure with his beloved Dr. Elizabeth Ross (Liv Tyler) and other scientists, he learns how to control his emotions and heart beat and to keep his human form for a long period. When General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross (William Hurt) finds a clue of his location in Brazil, he sends a command leaded by the tough Major Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to abduct Dr. Banner. However, he transforms in Hulk and escapes to Guatemala. Later he contacts Betty and his colleagues and when he is close to find his cure, Blonsky captures him and transforms himself in powerful beast The Abomination. Dr. Banner has to decide whether he should remain human or transform in The Incredible Hulk again to stop The Abomination.",/review/rw1888797/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2010,planktonrules,6," Despite a ton of smashing, this film actually was a tad dull...but watchable.
","Before getting into the film, I should probably point out that I am not the best reviewer for this film--unless, like me, you aren't all that familiar with the Hulk. Apart from seeing the pilot of the TV series and riding on the Hulk ride at Universal's theme park, The Island's of Adventure, I have never seen anything of the green guy--not a single comic book nor the previous movie from 2003. So, for the die-hard Hulkophile, I am certainly not the best person to review the film. In fact, I only have watched super hero films because I have a friend and daughter who push me to give them a try. And, in general, I have enjoyed them...but I am still not a big fan.",/review/rw1888797/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2008,Robert_duder,9," Completely obliterates Ang Lee's mistake and makes it right in a big way!!
","I am going to re-watch Ang Lee's Hulk generally considered disastrous by fans so I can review it properly but I seem to remember it being pretty awful and in no way an homage to the monstrous hero that fans love. Now I'm not a huge Marvel fan by any means but I love the hero movie and they needed to redeem Hulk and The Incredible Hulk redeemed him and then some. This was the true Hulk film that fans would have wanted and now we can firmly pretend HULK never existed. Relatively new director Louis Leterrier takes the helm and makes Ang Lee look like an amateur and clearly Leterrier must be a Hulk fan or at least turned to enormous Hulk fans because this had everything. The film paid huge homage to the original 70's/80's series which I think is just incredible. It used the music from the original series on one or two occasions, Edward Norton seemed to really channel and pay respect to Bill Bixby's Banner character and his transformation definitely leaned towards that. Terrific cameos from Stan Lee (as always), the original Hulk himself Lou Ferrigno in a terrific and funny cameo that felt like a hand over of the Hulk reigns (although it was only coffee), Robert Downey Jr., and mentions of Stark Industries (Iron Man), the Super Soldier program (Captain America) and other terrific Easter Eggs.",/review/rw1888797/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2008,Chrysanthepop,," The Hulk Is Back With A Smash
","'The Incredible Hulk' sort of takes of where Ang Lee's 'Hulk' ends. It's not an exact sequel as a few events are changed but arguably it serves well enough as a continuation. This one succeeds in parts where Ang Lee's film failed. Leterrier's direction works for an action film as it's got all the required ingredients. It's a lot slicker and full of action. The pacing is comparatively well set. The special effects are an improvement (but the CGI is still very prominent). The camera-work is solid and the score is wild. The story isn't as effective as say this year's 'Iron Man' because the characters aren't well fleshed out and the dialogues are a bit clichéd. Edward Norton fits the role of Bruce Banner quite well but we don't see much of him because of the CGI hulk. Eric Bana wasn't a bad choice for Ang Lee's Hulk either so I wouldn't compare the two actors. Actually, the Bruce Banner in Ang Lee's version was better fleshed out and gave Bana more scope to perform. Liv Tyler, however, is a little too weepy and she shouts a lot. Clearly Connelly was the better choice. Tim Roth and William Hurt are adequate. Overall, this is an enjoyable action flick even though it's no 'Iron Man'.",/review/rw1888797/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2010,vip_ebriega,6," Not incredible, but rather enjoyable 'Hulk'.

27 December 2015,ivo-cobra8,9," An Incredible reboot overall improvement over the original!
","The Incredible Hulk (2008) is A Marvel pure, fun, popcorn, Action superhero Film! This film is miles way better than The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron and 2003 film Hulk! I take this movie over both Avengers films and 2003 Hulk! This movie right now is still to this day, the most underrated Marvel movie of all-time. The majority of people disliking this movie and loves Mark Ruffalo's Avengers Hulk. In my opinion Edward Norton's Hulk/Bruce Banner is still to this day the best (not saying that Mark Ruffalo was bad because by all means he wasn't). This movie has class effects and it just as good as Iron Man. After watching Hulk (2003) I was really, really disappointed over that lame over long, boring to death super wannabe comic book film. Watching this, I was highly enjoyed, the movie was entertained, not bad at all, it was pretty good. Not boring, not to over long, I have enjoyed the hell out of this movie. It is awesome Action superhero comic book flick that does the job right! I am not a big comic book reader fan, I have not read Hulk comic books, but I did have watch the original TV show The Incredible Hulk (1977 - 1982) as a child. Been the biggest fan of that show, I know that in the TV show that, there was a reporter Jack McGee who was chasing Hulk trough the state, in this film Jack McGee is mentioned but as a journalist reporter student.

15 June 2008,griffolyon12,10," The Most Incredible Movie of the Summer so Far!!!
","I am not going to lie, I really was not that excited for this film when it was first announced, simply because the last time the Hulk made it to the big screen it was such a disappointment. Ang Lee's Hulk film from 2003 was a poor adaptation of one of my favorite comic book heroes. I have always loved the comics, but felt that the film didn't do the character justice, where as this new Hulk film, which is a reboot of the Hulk franchise, finally took advantage of the Hulk franchise and delivers an adaptation that is both truthful to the comics and entertaining at the same time.",/review/rw1888797/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2008,rama-28,10," My review: THE INCREDIBLE HULK
","Take a deep breath when you enter the cinema to see this one because it's just downright breathtaking. THE INCREDIBLE HULK is an amazing summer blockbuster movie. This reboot has made Ang Lee's Hulk back in 2003 seem like it never existed. Edward Norton's version portrays what Hulk is supposed to be on the big screen. Do not bootleg this one, do not wait til it hit DVD, Go watch it in the theaters because I guarantee you it is worth every penny. This movie is spectacular and superb in every way. It's a rock 'em smash 'em, jaw dropping thrill ride.",/review/rw1888797/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2008,abecipriano,7," Simpler but more entertaining movie
","First off, let's get one thing straight - - - this movie is NOT a sequel to the 2003 Hulk which had attempts to portray many things from the Hulk comics (father-son conflict, father-daughter strained relationship, a love triangle of sorts) that resulted in a confusing, sometimes scary (remember that scene where The Hulk was fighting off killer dogs?) movie.",/review/rw1888797/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2008,femaleanimefan,9," Spit out the 2003 version of Hulk like a bad taste in your mouth! This is an exciting movie
","I wasn't really sure if I'd like the movie. Ang Lee's version didn't please me at all. It didn't have enough action and it had far too much dialogue. I had never really been a fan of the Hulk comics, but I did like all the movie adaptations of the Marvel Comics. While I didn't enjoy The Incredible Hulk as much as Iron Man, it's still great fun, and it will definitely make a big profit at the box office, and hopefully more money than the first did.",/review/rw1888797/?ref_=tt_urv
