13 March 2022,tchitouniaram,7," Nothing to do with Paranormal Activity ...
","Except name there is nothing even remotely close to the original franchise , saying that , it is a very decent found footage horror film. Kept me interested right to the end .Nothing really special , but definitely worth to watch once !",/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2021,trashgang,6," nothing to do with the franchise
",This franchise was loved or hated by the fans. Still it was original in it's concept and due teens being afraid of the first entry it became a succes.,/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2021,kevin_robbins,6," I wouldnt call it the best Parabormal Activity movie but it's worth a viewing
",Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin (2021) is a movie I recently watched on Paramount+. The storyline follows an orphaned young lady who traces her roots back to a Mormon society in the country. They take her in with open arms and show her their ways and tell her the story of her mother. As she stays with them she starts seeing weird phenomenon by the woods and around a rundown church. If she digs too much into her family history she may find more than she wants to know.,/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2022,elliotjeory,7," Decent film
",I had low expectations for this film and I was suprised when it turned out to be a good thriller. It's an interesting story and it's creepy in parts. It's better than some paranormal activity sequels which may not be saying much but if you like creepy horrors it's worth a watch.,/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2021,jtindahouse,5," Has nothing that used to make the Paranormal Activity movies great
","'Paranormal Activity' films used to be the staple of every Halloween. They were remarkably consistent right up until the very unfortunate 'Ghost Dimension' which killed the series. Now, years later, we have another entry in the 'Paranormal Activity' series. The only problem is that it is a part of the series in name only. It has no connection to the previous films and it has nothing that demands it be a 'Paranormal Activity' movie. It could be any old found footage film - and not a very good one at that.",/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2021,YRLY59E,6," Moderately more entertaining than some of the others in the series
","I mean it's not bad, it creates a good found footage atmosphere a few elements are just a bit too cheesy and some of the shots detract from the ambiance. Maybe 15 min less chopping some of the cheesiest parts and a few of the camera cuts would have made this a really decent movie. As it stands it's kinda long. It's still entertaining enough and just creepy enough to make a good watch for the Halloween weekend.",/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,Fortressofdoors,6," Midsommar meets Rec
","I won't go into it too much because it would be basically a repeat of what has already been said. This is not a Paranormal Activity movie, it just borrows from the name for promotional purposes. For that, I was disappointed.",/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,kuarinofu,6," It was alright
","I might be somewhat biased cause I enjoy Eubank's works to a certain extent. I think he's consistently almost a good director. The Signal was an interesting starting project, Underwater was too rushed and too focused on Steward though.",/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,jmbwithcats,7," I really liked it
","I'm watching Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin and honestly, even though some say it's a reboot or unrelated, it feels completely related to the series... the Amish family teaching the children in part 5 are a lot like perhaps who these people are before they came to the city.",/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2021,stellafoster,5," Watchable but not a PA film
","I love the PA franchise because they were original back in the day, and they scared the bejesus out of me. The third movie is my favourite. That rotating fan in the kitchen!!!!",/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2021,S_dot_M_dot,6," Should Be a Stand-Alone
","Tracked down by a distant relative after being abandoned by her mother, Margot (Emily Bader) gets a documentary crew to get a first-hand account of where she is from. Traveling to Amish country alongside Chris (Roland Buck III) and sound guy Dale (Dan Lippert), Margot discovers the way of life her true family lives. Night after night of unsettling encounters, Margot soon discovers why her mother may have given her up.",/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,SoumikBanerjee25,6," The Last Act More Than Makes Up For It
","I'm probably one of those very few people who continue to have a soft spot for this franchise. Don't know about the others, but for me 'Paranormal Activity will forever have a special place in my heart. Cause, it is precisely what introduced me to this rather deserted realm of Found Footage and now being an admirer of the same, I couldn't feel more indebted.",/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,alexfiles,8," Fun, enjoyable B horror
","That's pretty much it! Emily Bader did a great job, as did the rest of the cast. If this is the kind of movie you like, this is a good movie!",/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2021,Draysan-Jennings,7," Predictable but good
",I've always been a fan of the Paranormal Activity movies. I think this is one of the better films in the series. There was a few twists here and there but a lot of it was fairly predictable. You'd have to be oblivious if you didn't figure out the plot after the first 30 minutes. Either way I still enjoyed this film. I liked the new concept and most importantly it held my attention. Definitely a film worth checking out.,/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,phenomynouss,5," moderately interesting flim marred by bad technical decisions
","Whether by attaching itself to the Paranormal Activity franchise or some other reason, this film commits itself to being a found footage style horror film. This works great for most of the Paranormal Activity films, and even works out nicely for many parts of this film.",/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,queeroid,7," The Halloween III of the Paranormal Activity franchise
",It's a good found footage(-ish) film. But it's not great. And it _definitely_ should not be called Paranormal Activity. The cash grab of slapping that name onto the title is a big mistake that just ruins it for the people who would watch it. I'll explain...,/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv

30 October 2021,paul_haakonsen,3," Paranormal boredom...
","When I sat down to watch the 2021 horror movie ""Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin"", I must admit that I wasn't really expecting much of anything grand here, as the movies have been dull, uneventful and over-hyped since the very first movie. Yet, I have stuck with the franchise and watched the movies as the years went by, hoping that eventually the franchise would get better.",/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2021,SnoopyStyle,5," Paranormal goes Amish
",Margot with her friends Chris and Dale are filming her quest to find her biological family. She was adopted after being abandon at a hospital. Her search leads to Amish country and a dark secret world.,/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2021,FixedYourEnding,7," Franchise or not, this is a solid horror movie
","I actually liked it. The ""found footage"" genre is always questionable. It was done impeccably in the 1st movie in the franchise by Oren Peli, it is not perfect here and might bother some people, the idea is that ""found footage"" plays tricks with you mind to the level of ""maybe it actually did happen"", this would not be the case here, so the camera style here doesn't add much, it could have just been filmed in a regular manner. It seems this addition to the ""Paranormal activity"" franchise was done mainly to attract viewers, which I'm sure was successful on that front, due to the large number of fans of this franchise.",/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2021,subxerogravity,6," More thrilling as a franchise than scary as a stand alone
",I'll start by saying that I prefer to see a paranormal activity movie at the movie theatre vs. At home. I always enjoyed the experience better there.,/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2021,saysjenn,6," Entertaining
",It wasn't awful and followed the paranormal activity formula of scary. The setting as quite different at an Amish home. The environment was very creepy and had some good scares. It's worth watching if you like the franchise.,/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2021,gab-67599,7," Not Bad
",You know those movies you wish would keep going just so you could see how it all turned out. This was one of those movies. Let me first say if you do NOT like found footage you will not appreciate this movie. Although the start was VERY slow... the end was extremely powerful that energy at the end was what I had hope for the whole movie to be but it just wasn't. I honestly jumped a few times so it was not all bad.,/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2022,koltonbrett,6," Entertaining though we pretty much know what's coming.
","Next of Kin is the SEVENTH installment of the Paranormal Activity franchise. Rather than a continuation of the previous films, Next of Kin is supposed to be a reboot. As a stand alone movie, it's decently entertaining. As a reboot, it really needed to be better. It's not boring, it's just not anything extraordinarily interesting. It feels like a very familiar demonic horror film. From the get go, you have a general idea of where things are going. The title of this movie gives too much away. I enjoyed the isolated Amish country setting. There's the creepy old house, no electricity, no phone service, and they're surrounded by woods and farmland. It's indeed a spooky setting for a scary story. The weaknesses of this movie are its run-of-the-mill storyline and lack of scares. I remember the first Paranormal Activity being truly chilling. I wasn't chilled this time but there are suspenseful moments that hold the attention. I appreciated some of the creativity with the found footage filming technique. It separates itself from older found footage horror movies by displaying some modern technology capabilities. For example, drone usage and slow motion shots. The acting is good here and the characters are interesting enough. They keep us engaged throughout.",/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2021,Go_For_The_Jugular,3," *Deep Sigh*
","Ok, so I'm over the moon to know that the Paranormal Activity franchise is still going strong...there's another one due in 2022, but I'm disappointed that after all this time, this is the best they could come up with.",/review/rw7491680/?ref_=tt_urv
