","I was living in Japan at the time the movie came out and I didn't get it at the time. My mistake was thinking the movie had anything to do with Tokyo and for me, seeing Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) be bored in Tokyo seemed so stupid to me.",/review/rw1788335/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2005,Derek237,10," A great film, but the rating was lost in translation
","It's very interesting to see all of the ratings that Lost In Translation received in different countries. In Canada it is only PG, while in America it's rated R! And really, the only explanation for this is a brief scene at a strip joint that shows some nudity. I really look down on that R rating because Lost In Translation is a good-hearted film that should be enjoyed by all ages. Notice how during the 2003 Oscar season two films played the ""only one special effect: the effect on the audience"" card; one being this film and the other being Mystic River. Both are great films, both are rated R in the U.S., but only one of them can carry along its story without brutal murders.",/review/rw1788335/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2004,TxMike,," Filmed in Tokyo, with Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, one of the better movies I've seen in a while.

23 March 2007,Torgo_Approves,10," Perfect.
","Death in Vegas' spellbinding song ""Girls"" perfectly sets the tone for Sofia Coppola's second feature film, the bittersweet, intelligent, mature and absolutely wonderful Lost in Translation. Trying to summarize the movie is almost pointless because the emotions the film sparks within you (in my case, at least) can't be described in words. The basic story follows Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a washed-up, depressed actor and an emotionally confused newlywed respectively, as they accidentally meet on Park Hyatt Hotel in Tokyo. The two form an unusual bond, but a bond that is infinitely stronger than that which they share with their respective wife and husband (Charlotte's partner is a jittery photographer who doesn't pay very much attention to her; Bob's better half keeps calling him, pestering him about which colour they should choose for the carpet back home). Bob and Charlotte's relationship is not really a sexual thing so much as a matter of emotional understanding. They're both stuck in life, unsure of what to do with the rest of it and certainly not very satisfied with what they've done with it so far. It's very touching to watch, in a refreshingly non-sappy way.",/review/rw1788335/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2004,SECurtisTX,9," Lost Souls
","It's been a long time since a movie has made me hurt the way this one did. Perhaps ""hurt"" isn't the right word.  ""Ache"" is more like it.  I could so completely identify with both characters.  ",/review/rw1788335/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2005,Hitchcoc,8," A Quiet, Personal Film
","Being in a profession where there is constant noise, I enjoyed this movie for a very odd reason. The characters are pulling away from a hyped up society, away from a world, much of which is based on needless, trivial noise. Everywhere they go there is more numbing action. Watching the director of the commercial gyrating, trying to act like a real film director, despite the fact that they are doing a 30 second liquor commercial, typifies some of what this movie is about, a world where people are worn into the ground by a type A culture that is as vapid and unnecessary as we can imagine. I thought the Bill Murray character developed tremendously. While this trip to Japan was excruciatingly dull (money isn't everything), I believe that he began to see things he hadn't seen before. I liked that while he was struggling with his marriage, the crises were simple, day to day things that living brings to us. The young woman he meets shows through a whimsical kindness, that he is worth something. She is refreshing to look at an to be with. He, like many middle aged men, has self doubts. Because she has a sense of purity and can talk to him honestly about her world and his, he should go back to his life a little more sustained.",/review/rw1788335/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10," Sad, funny, magical and irresistibly moving
","I had been well aware of this film's reputation as a masterpiece for some time, and when I finally saw it I was so glad I did. I have seen it three times now, it improves each time. Lost in Translation is a brilliant film, but also a film you need to see more than once to appreciate it.",/review/rw1788335/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2017,areatw,5," Lost on me...
","I usually agree with the general consensus on what makes a good film and what doesn't, but very occasionally I find myself watching a widely popular film and wondering what on earth people saw in it. 'Lost in Translation' is one of those films. It did nothing for me and I thought it was very average and even forgettable.",/review/rw1788335/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2006,kevinmanf,10," A masterpiece about the mood and states of the characters
","It is not easy to talk about ""Lost in Translation"". Sofia Coppola's second film as a director is in part about things we never talk about. While its two protagonists try to find mutual solace in each other, their silence is as expressive as their words. This is a film that believes that an individual can have a valuable relationship with someone else without becoming part of that person's life. At 19 years of age, I am not married but I can understand pretty well that it is easier for a stranger with whom you share a moment in the bar or corridor to understand your problems better than your husband or wife. Here is an extract from Roger Ebert's great review of the film: ""We all need to talk about metaphysics, but those who know us well want details and specifics; strangers allow us to operate more vaguely on a cosmic scale. When the talk occurs between two people who could plausibly have sex together, it gathers a special charge: you can only say ""I feel like I've known you for years"" to someone you have not known for years.""

16 April 2007,dmgrundy,6," Little more than a ""mood"" piece
","It's hard, at first, to fathom why this film is so successful - perhaps it's because people think they've seen a 'meaningful' film - it lacks violence, sex (apart from a brief, off-screen reference and another brief scene in a strip club), swearing, and a clearly delineated plot, unfolding in a leisurely, low-key, melancholy, soporific fashion. So sure, it's not M:I3, but that doesn't automatically make it high art, or even a particularly good film, either. Too often Coppola seems content to let the camera sweep smoothly over night-life shots of Tokyo, or linger over Johanssen and Murray's serious faces, with perhaps some music sweeping over to make one think one's watching something 'meaningful.' (In fact, surprisingly for a woman director, Coppola seems to exploit the (admittedly beautiful) Johanssen somewhat - a long amount of time is spent in which the camera gazes on her, often partially clothed (though not nude or bare-breasted), and I was particularly troubled by the opening shot of her behind, which seems to have very little to do with the rest of the film apart from offering titillation for the audience.) The dialogue, which could have saved the movie, often fails to live up to expectations - the central scene, mentioned by another reviewer, where Murray and Johanssen are lying next to each other on the bed, and he gives her his thoughts on life, is quite touching, but he doesn't end up saying anything of much significance, just some bland generalisations about life/experience, and we never really get too many character insights. It's too elusive, too much concerned with surface, despite the fact that so many of its fans praise it for going deeper than most blockbusters. At times I felt I was watching an extended commercial, of the kind that seem prevalent nowadays - seductive visual images with meditative music transposed over the top, calming in a new age meditation kind of a way, but ultimately not saying much.",/review/rw1788335/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2005,mlee-29,10," Lingers for days- sucks you in.
",Few movies make you THINK long after they end. That's OK. Movies are supposed to entertain and most do so without requiring even one ounce of thought. It's sad that maybe some of you out there prefer movies- and life- that way. Thankfully this movie is all about thinking and feeling. This is not a chick flick.

29 April 2015,StevePulaski,8," The equivalent of cinematic fishing - once you're hooked, the film isn't letting you go
","Lost in Translation details the kind of wayward search for human connection many of us go through in life, sometimes young, sometimes old, or following a traumatic event. It's the time in our lives when we feel the most lost, and truthfully, many of us don't want answers as to how to better our situation, but just want somebody to go along for the ride. We'd like to find someone to empathize with, embrace on a frequent basis, and know that somebody cares about us and our wayward ways and to reciprocate such feelings.",/review/rw1788335/?ref_=tt_urv

What does one do when one is trying to catch up on some badly needed sleep in a foreign hotel? One watches television.

","Yes, Bill Murray, in a tailor-made role, is excellent and memorable. Even in a weak movie, he was probably worth of being considered for an Oscar nomination.   However, in my humble opinion, this is a wanna-be art-house film masquerading as a movie that succeeds in neither endeavor.

30 July 2016,sharky_55,5," For relaxing times, make it Suntory time.
","Lost in Translation is a comfortable film. It's Antonioni-lite, it's existentialism 101, it poses these characters as tortured, angsty souls that can't seem to reconcile their desires of self-actualisation and the obligations of their privileged existence. It has become clear by now that Sofia Coppola has also found a comfort zone; she's visited this material before, of the upper-middle class citizen surrounded and disgusted by artificial excess and seeking solace beyond what is already granted to them by birth or status (Somewhere, and The Virgin Suicides). You can always make this work, but there is a very fine line between being genuine and being simply self-absorbed.",/review/rw1788335/?ref_=tt_urv

14 June 2007,FilmCriticLalitRao,1," ""Coppola"" tag helped this pretentious dross gain worldwide acclaim.
","To my mind this is just an average ordinary silly film. The entire film takes place in an hotel. This is just fine but by showing some shots of a Tokyo skyscraper hotel heaven only knows what Ms. Coppola wished to convey. May be she wanted to depict that as people live in high buildings their feelings,emotions become low. A word about the bewildered American in Japan oh no Tokyo. Bill Murray looks utterly lost as if he has not been paid his salary for playing the part in the film. Scarlett is fine but she could have done better. The worst thing about this film is that Japanese people were caricatured. It is as if all the Japanese people use very long sentences even for expressing simplest of ideas. For all those lost souls interested in Japan bashing, please watch Alain Corneau's film ""Stupeur et tremblements"".",/review/rw1788335/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2008,Amadio,1," One of the worst films ever made
","Having lived in Japan for many years (I'm from Ireland) I was looking forward to a Bill Murray comedy about the extraordinary city that is Tokyo and the incomprehensible (to most Westerners) Japanese. Instead, I was subjected to what I can only call racist abuse. If this film had been made in Africa about Africans' behavior, speech, dress and customs, everyone would have been up in arms. Every cliché about Japan was thrown in. Bill Murray just didn't have to act, and not even Scarlet could redeem the mess. Coppola had to film in the hotel in secret as she wasn't given permission to use the place, and I can see why. It could have been a wonderful film full of insights into the quirky (?) nature of the Japanese as seen by Westerners instead of the hackneyed meaningless dirge. Just because Americans never travel, jet lag becomes a plot piece. Jeez! Jet lag? You have got to be kidding me. For anyone who knows anything about Japan this was an insult.",/review/rw1788335/?ref_=tt_urv

","What's there to say? This is a movie in which nothing happens. And it happens to a bunch of utterly uninteresting nobodies. Bill Murray is supposedly engaged in ""understated"" acting. Mostly he looks like a man either bored to death, or in one weeklong Valium trance. His counterpart, Scarlet Johansson, is lost in some sort of existential fog. Maybe these are the kind of people who relate to this movie, and thus find some sort of deep, meaningful message in it. I don't. ",/review/rw1788335/?ref_=tt_urv
