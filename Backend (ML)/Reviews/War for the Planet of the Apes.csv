11 January 2018,bora_mustafa,8," Though inferior to Dragonball/Z, Super is better than Dragonball GT!!!
","As a long time viewer I absolutely love Dragonball, as well as Dragonball Z. These first two series were legendary and gave us some of the most memorable characters ever. Recently after watching the first four seasons of Dragonball Super, I felt compelled to re-watch the original series again so that I can make a fair comparison between the two.

",First of all this show is better than GT! Don't even try to say that Gt was better than this.,/review/rw8111382/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2016,searcherer,9," Great Work Overall
","Great anime is what it is. Lovable characters, intense action, humor, and anticipation are all blended into a seemingly never ending story that keeps you wanting for more. The variety of new characters that this new series brings is especially wonderful - it's both, wide and thoughtful. The fight sequences are good as ever, with thrilling and suspenseful moments that draw you the more.. can't wait for Sundays!",/review/rw8111382/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2019,jonesmi-75978,9," Dragonball is Life itself
","I love this anime to the core. The plot can seem ridiculous when they manage to surpass the power levels of their foes when their life is at stake, but it has taught me in real life that whenever a powerful foe/circumstance arises, I must Look to God first of all but to also look within the wonderful mind He has given me to overcome and work out how to defeat every opponent. This is the only anime that has actually genuinely brought me to tears. Many of the other Anime's try way to hard to be emotional, they force it and it just makes me sick. Dragonball is a natural! However, i do have a bit of discontentment with how powerful some people become. People have been achieving in one day what it took Goku and Vegeta to achieve in about 20 years!!! ( I calculated these years given how Gohan was a minor in the Frieza Saga). Please stick to the rules Dragonball writers.",/review/rw8111382/?ref_=tt_urv

29 March 2021,shivammp,10," If someone asks you to give the definition of masterpiece, just make them watch this show
","Although I've never written such a review for any series, this one surely made me write it. If you're reading this review to figure out whether to watch DBS or not, then surely get on with it. You'll not regret it. The story escalates quickly from the first saga itself. It keeps getting interesting with new characters getting introduced on the way. It's a perfect combination of action, adventure and comedy too. The animations are too good and the dubbing too. Once you watch this anime, you'll want your memory to be erased so that you can watch it again. Trust me it's that great.",/review/rw8111382/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2017,ericstevenson,10," Mostly what we want
","When ""Dragonball GT"" ended in 1997, rumors went around everywhere about a fourth Dragonball series, usually going by the name ""Dragonball AF"". In reality, this show doesn't exist and now we know for a fact that it never will. This is the actual fourth Dragonball series that we've been wanting to see for literally eighteen years. Is it better than ""Dragonball GT""? Yes, much better. I just looked up and found out that that show is no longer considered canon, even though this one wasn't based on any manga. I remember watching ""Dragonball Z: Battle Of Gods"" in theaters and being blown away by how awesome it was.",/review/rw8111382/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2016,william-e-sepulveda,10," Dragon Ball Super is getting SUPER BETTER!! Off to the Champa Arc!
","Say what you say about the animation in some episodes, nothing stops me from loving this show! Dragon Ball Z is a big part of my childhood and i am glad that we have a new series. Sure the first arcs are based Battle of Gods and Resurrection F, but i don't mind this at all as in my mind it's a good idea to make these arcs for those who have not seen the two movies, which are all canon and so is this show. I think the real highlight will be the new Arc, where the Z-Fighters are heading to a new Tournament between the 7th Universe and the 6th Universe. Hopefully we get an English Dub of this anime, cause when it comes to Dragon Ball, it's one of those few anime you see in English. Oh and IMDb, tell Google to fix a problem when every time i search Dragon Ball Super, the rating is 7.9 on Google, but when i clicked it, it leads to Dragon Ball Absalon. Just a word of advice.",/review/rw8111382/?ref_=tt_urv

29 July 2017,shoguncrosse,10," Simply Put, If you Enjoyed Z You'll Enjoy This Greatly...
","Simply Put, If you Enjoyed Z You'll Enjoy This Greatly...According to IMDb, I must have at least up to four lines of review characters/words or whatever in order to submit this review so I will say just a few more things to those still on the edge of whether this is a good series or not or whether to watch or keep watching at all...Well, put your fears and negative perceptions of the series aside, plot holes/inaccuracies from Z and all, and just watch...I promise it is NOT dull, boring, or slow paced...(well, in some cases a few episodes go by before more good action comes along but what anime doesn't do this? And besides, its not as bad or even close to the seemingly '100' episode subplot fillers of Naruto thank god! lmao) Each saga, so far (im up to episode 101, 3rd or 4th saga) is only 10-15 episodes it seems. This current saga, the Universal Survival Saga, and the best so far in the series, EVER, yes including Z, seems to be much longer...about 8-10 episodes as like a preamble before the huge tournament that is occurring now (no spoilers) which has lasted to about 3 episodes so far, going into its 4th of the actual fighting and action of the tournament that is featured. If you are a DBZ fan in any way, you should NOT be disappointing by this series UNLESS you were expecting a recurring story from the now dropped GT, (which actually sorta touches on with the multiversal story lines btw! Not much, but hints!)or a recurring story from the BUU saga that is FULLY intact and without a single plothole...I, personally, haven't seen or spotted any plot holes throughout Super, but it has been many years since watched the final BUU saga of Z, and also, it's just an action packed cartoon thats chalk full of nostalgia, better animations, better fight scenes, more powerful heroes and villains, power levels that rival anything you've seen or wanted to see on Z (which we all know the dragon ball universe is all about the power levels! ""Its over 9000!"" lmao) Well folks, the Super series IS OVER 900,000,000! lmfao Trust in that....",/review/rw8111382/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2018,GeorgeStrCy89,10," How can you not like this?
","Yes I know the series didn't start with the best possible way, especially after THAT episode on King Kai's planet when Goku first fought Beerus and the quality of animation was unacceptable, to be honest I have no idea why they released an episode with such a quality, but they did! After that many people came here (and not only here) to give low rating to the series as usual! Like one or few episodes represent the entire series, what about the other 100+ episodes?",/review/rw8111382/?ref_=tt_urv

5 June 2021,brookeumar,10," Jiren vs Goku
","Just for the rivalry that emerges between Goku and Jiren in the Tournament Of Power(TOP) and Jiren beating the hell out of Goku, even his Super Saiyan Blue kioken times 20 and then Goku using his greatest final weapon The spirit bomb but unfortunately ends up getting absorbed by own spirit bomb, everybody believing that Goku has died from his own spirit bomb and then all of a sudden everybody feels a strange energy and Beerus says He is coming. And the hype when we first see Ultra Instinct Goku and what it can do, a level even God's cannot achieve easily, all God's of destruction get shocked and then as the fight goes on Goku giving tough time to Jiren but somehow Jiren is still much stronger and defeats Goku once again and then after Goku fights another with Jiren gets involved in another fight with a strong and much hated warrior Kefla which is actually the fusion between two saiyan girls and Goku once again giving a glimpse of Ultra Instinct and defeating Kefla with a powerful Kamehameha. Then we move towards another fight between Goku and Jiren in which Goku finally Masters Ultra Instinct and we get to see it's full form and Goku destroying Jiren and then with the help of Freiza and No.17 Knocking him out of the tournament and the tournament ends by Universe 7 being victorious.",/review/rw8111382/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am Dragon Ball fan and this is by far my most favourite serie ever. I just love this serie because of the characters development,the forms and the main thing the arcs. Future Trunks and The tournament of power arc are the best arc. The introduction of the super saiyan god and the super saiyan blue was just insane and then we got to see Goku's Ultra Instinct form whic break's the internet I was just freaked out at that time. Some people were hating this serie because of the animation the forms etc. But I just love this serie.",/review/rw8111382/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2022,mcatalin94,10," Many negatives for a must watch anime!
","It starts with two stories that could have had very good potential, Beerus and the return of Frieza. But making no built up stories, easy power ups to highest ever level, no emotions whatsoever connected to any of the characters, made it rushed and poor. And here is not the problem that they made fools out of some of the strongest characters in the series, Beerus and Whis by being weak to food, as even a Shinigami in Death Note has weakness to apples. Not things like this are the problem.. but the fact that Beerus should have stayed in the shadow for longer, make us want to see his power, make us fear him, make us wonder and by the end power up our hero for a special fight with one of the strongest in the Universe, instead of making a friend out of him, resulting in a joke for what is to follow, once you have such power on your side.. there is no more fear whatsoever for the destiny of our heroes. Frieza should have had one of the greatest come backs in Anime history, one to remember - like the Edo Tensei from Naruto...",/review/rw8111382/?ref_=tt_urv
