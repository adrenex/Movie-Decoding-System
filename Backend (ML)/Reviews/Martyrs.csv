11 December 2018,Platypuschow,7," Extinction: Nice surprise
","What is it with Netflix lately? They're taking over, everything I watch seems to be a Netflix original movie. And in some cases such as this one that's not entirely a bad thing.",/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," The twist *is* what makes this film a brilliant and rare gem
","I read a few reviews people complaining about the 'twist' and thus I didn't know what to expect. I had seen the trailer and found it interesting, curious, and was impressed with the visuals but hesitant with Michael Peña's acting, but still decided to see this film.",/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2021,jamesvass-62316,5," Yep, those kids are just so distracting...
","As the plot unfolds and you gradually become invested in the story and it's trajectory, the child characters do their best to distract the viewer by just being little pains... They seem to actively do everything they can to get the main characters killed off... I think this Netflix sci-fi flick should have rated much higher had it not been for those characters... Shame.",/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2018,lat297,8," Some balance here...
","I've never written a review, but felt compelled to do so after reading some of the 1 star reviews here. ",/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2018,Sleepin_Dragon,8," I really enjoyed it. Expect the unexpected.
","Half way through the film I kept thinking this is like Skyline, a film I hated, but good. As it went on however, it just got better and better, the twist comes as a huge surprise, one I certainly never expected. This has been advertised on a huge scale, and is I would say better then the adverts would have you believe.",/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2018,freqeteq,6," It's OK
","The story is quite fresh, I went in not knowing anything about the film so didn't see the twists and turns that it takes coming, which is quite a rarity with movies these days for me. The effects both cgi and practical are well done for the most part, though some of the cgi does suffer from looking like really good cgi rather than something that's actually real. Overall though it's a solid bit of science fiction fare to spend a couple of hours with. ",/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2020,Gordon-11,," Good story but very irritating
","The story is good, particularly the twist in the middle. However, the children were far too annoying in the beginning, and the ending is too irritating. Stopping the train to risk the lives of hundreds isn't acceptable. Slither irritating thing is that the father sits next to the window when he's being shot at, which is pretty stupid.",/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2019,phillafrenais,6," Bloody kids
",Cut the whining annoying kids and have a slightly bigger budget and this would have been pretty good.,/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2018,phenomynouss,5," too boring for its main conceit/surprise twist (Spoilers in review, summary in title)
","It feels to me a bit like cheating nowadays when i write movie reviews that end up needing to be marked for spoilers and basically end up describing the whole plot. In some cases, where the spoilers issue encompasses so much of the movie, it necessitates either an incredibly short, concise review amounting to little more than ""stuff was happening, then WOW watch out stuff changed! I didn't like it"" or a play-by-play of the movie in full spoiler mode. In some cases, spoilers for a movie or TV show can actually be what entices someone to watch it (in my case, i had absolutely no interest in Battlestar Galactica the 2004-2009 series until I read spoilers on how the series ended, and so I gave it a shot and absolutely loved it)",/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2018,lucy-partridge,8," Much better than expected - original and thought provoking
",I started watching this thinking I knew what to expect and I was very pleasantly surprised by how the plot turned. It was all there in the beginning but the story tellers did a job of subtly setting things up. I thought that the cast was talented and diverse and it was nice to see familiar faces getting the center stage they deserve. I'm not giving any spoilers but I just wanted to express that this really deserved d impress me and I enjoyed it and thought it was clever. I'll be thinking about it for a while.,/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2019,kingsx_64,7," Could have been a solid 9
","If the dialogue went like this;
Father- Come on, we gotta go
Little annoying twit; -I don't wanna daddy
Father- OK, fine. Then stay here by yourself. I never liked you anyway.
Little annoying twit- Your leaving me?
Father- Hell yea, shoulda dropped you off at the orphanage
a long time ago..
Movie crowd cheers giving dad a standing ovation.",/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv

27 July 2018,mrsylhet,8," You will be surprised if you stick to it
","Slightly boring first half, but it picks up right after a great twist. Have patience, stick to it and you will be surprised for sure.",/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2020,Kamurai25,7," ""Home World Invasion""
","Really good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.",/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2018,Alexander_Blanchett,7," Wait for the second half
","Okay I must say it was one of those films that truly develop during the watching experience. At first it starts like your usual alien invaion film, ultra boring and your standard fare. But then there is a twist and the film got a total turn around and new perspective, It actually became interesting, dramatic and thoughtprovoking. 
It was nice to see Michael Pena in a leading role, which is rare. He was quite well. Lizzie Caplan was also decent enough. I liked the two girls as well. Otherwise it was just rather mediocre on the acting department. 
The effects looked a bit cheap at times, as did the costume work. The editing was good and the score as well. 
I really think a lot of people actually switched it off after the first half hour or the first encounter with the strangers, but I think it deserves to be given a chance as there is an explanation for many things that seem to be a directional error or cheap effect/look.",/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2018,sugardaddy-31900,6," Not a bad film
","Decent enough film with a little twist. Not sure about having kids in it as all they do is cry, slow you up and of course they usual ""I'm gunna disregard what my parents tell me and leave to find my teddy bear thus putting everyone in even more danger"". Hollywood rarely changes these days so expect the ending you're expecting.",/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2021,gunn-wrights,8," A little slow, but the reveal(s) are worth it
","It's hard to write anything about this movie as to do so would be giving huge spoilers, which I DON'T want to do. Trust me! It's been over a year since I saw this movie, and it has stuck in my memory (I watch a lot of movies).",/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv

",Why are teens and kids so annoying in these types of movies?,/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2020,ninochandra,5," The kids ruined the movie!
","This should probably potentially be a decent movie.. but throughout the film I was sooooo distracted by the loud whining kids and its so annoying... they're not even essential to the movie. Yes I get it that the movie wants to potray a regular family having some alien attacks, but please... it was too over the top and makes you cringe... I believe alot of viewers would want the kids to be dead instead of being empathetic to the characters.",/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2018,ddiesonne,7," Nice twist
","The first half of the movie is pretty boring and reminds quite a lot of a cheap 90s B-movie. Then there's the twist, and things get a lot more interesting. I felt like... my patience was at least partially rewarded.",/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2018,staryellow,6," Good writing but those damn kids!!!
","Reason I'm reviewing is mainly due to my frustration with the kids and the poor decisions. Unexpected plot though, really great concept and the annoying factors actually kept me intrigued. The more I said ""I can't with this"" the more I watched, found myself yelling at the tv and scripting my own versions of how I'd handle those kids! Discipline! Sigh!",/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2019,krisboogie,7," Pacing was slow but they won me over with the twist
","I would rate the first half of the movie a bit lower. The idea for the movie was good, the acting was mostly good, but the pacing was too slow. I lost interest halfway through but they really brought me back once the twist was revealed. It was a good ending that brought the whole movie together and did really well blurring the lines between ""good guys/bad guys"".",/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2018,claudio_carvalho,8," One of the Best Recent Sci-Fi
","""Extinction"" is certainly one of the best recent sci-fi, with a great story and a surprising plot point. Peter (Michael Peña) has a recurring nightmare of an alien attack and like Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""Total Recall"", he has a strange sensation that his dream might be a premonition. When the planet is invaded and the population is really attacked, Peter and his family try to survive and he makes the most unexpected discovery. It is very hard to write about ""Extinction"" avoiding spoilers but if the viewer likes unexpected thought provoking twists in a sci-fi story, this is the film he (or she) was waiting for. Surprisingly it is totally underrated in IMDb. Maybe the viewers have not understood the plot point. The only problem is indeed Peter´s unbearable daughters. My vote is eight.",/review/rw7256068/?ref_=tt_urv
