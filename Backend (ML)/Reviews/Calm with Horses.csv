29 September 2022,deloudelouvain,7," Only in America.
","Based on true events you kinda hope this story is just all made up or at least seriously dramatized. If everything really happened like in the movie than we have a melting pot of incredibly stupid people, from the hostages to the hostage taker to the police. That said the movie is well shot, but the best thing about it is the acting. Good job from the entire cast making this an enjoyable movie to watch. The story is sad though, but realistic as we all know the VA is a shame in a country that proclaims itself as the greatest country in the world. The story could and would have been finished in half an hour in any other country by simply giving the man his 892 dollars. But it's the United States, the land of the trigger happy, where killing people is almost a national sport. Hopefully and most likely the sniper will read every single review as that's what vain people do so that he can read what a scumbag he is, he's the only one that should rot in prison for the rest of his days. Killing somebody for 892 dollars, shame on you America.",/review/rw8500028/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2022,AfricanBro,5," That's it?
","It's hard to call a movie based on a true story uninspiring or flat out boring because it's a depiction of the actual events and if it's dramatized it moves towards fiction, away from the truth. But this really was not interesting, and the worst part is John Boyega put out what is probably his best performance yet, and in one of his last performances before his passing, Michael Kenneth Williams also did his character justice... but the story just wasn't good enough. You're thrown into the middle of the plot and without any character development, expected to somehow care about the character. It's a heartbreaking story sure, but it's not captivating enough and pretty predictable especially since you hear all throughout the movie how exactly it's going to end, repeated over and over. Three movies premiered tonight and I couldn't watch all of them 'cause of the timings so I opted for this, and after nearly two hours I regret it; somebody loudly sighed ""that's it?"" when the credits rolled and the whole theatre mumbled in agreement. It was a realistic take on true events, but it lacked any suspense or thrill to keep you interested, no matter how sad the situation the marine war vet was in. It's sad an important message won't get the delivery it deserves. Also, John Boyega gave me Denzel Washington vibes in this.",/review/rw8500028/?ref_=tt_urv

","Solid drama based on the true story of an ex-Marine who took over a Georgia bank in 2017 threatening to blow it and a pair employees up with a bomb.

","As I've said many times about one-location films in the past, they can be very hit or miss for me. When done well, they're some of my favourites, but one that's not engaging can also just be boring from start to finish. Breaking is one of the latest films to basically take place in one location, and while it may not be the best one I've ever seen, it's still one of the best films I've seen this year. Breaking is so well-crafted that the run time felt non-existent to me. Here are some of the many reasons I believe this film deserves way more attention than it's getting.",/review/rw8500028/?ref_=tt_urv

18 September 2022,danieljfarthing,8," A hard-hitting, classy, true-tale drama - excellently performed & directed
","In true-tale drama ""Breaking"" John Boyega superbly channels Denzel Washington as a US Marine vet in Georgia who facing destitution when unfairly denied $793 by Veterans Affairs in 2017, held up a bank to highlight his case. Thru the ensuing tense siege (with hostages Nicole Bahari & Selenis Leyva) Boyega talks with po-po (inc Michael Kenneth Williams & Jeffrey Donovan), press (inc Connie Britton) & family (Olivia Washington & London Covington)... but where's it headed? Excellently performed (esp Boyega & Bahari) and terrifically directed (by Abi Damari Corbin (who also co-wrote it with Kwame Kwei-Armah)) this is a hard-hitting & classy movie indeed.",/review/rw8500028/?ref_=tt_urv

","LOW RATINGS FROM THOSE WHO JUST DON'T CARE
Anyone who understands the human condition of dealing with a society that doesn't care about the most vulnerable people who struggle day after day, will appreciate the message of this important movie. It's not only veterans who face homelessness, it's also those who suffer from mental illness. In any case, they are mostly alone and struggling to figure out how to get the help they need. By the time they get any direction on where to go and who to ask, they are already beaten down and their spirits are broken. This is the point for them in which death means peace and freedom.",/review/rw8500028/?ref_=tt_urv

",I was privileged enough to see this as part of the 2022 Sundance Film Festival and it was decent. My biggest praise for this film is the performances. All of them are great especially John Boyega. I've only seen him in the sequel trilogy where he doesn't have a lot to do so it was really fun seeing him finally have the spotlight and he does a fantastic job here. Michael K. Williams and Nicole Beharie do a fantastic job as well here. Another big plus here is the message about how we treat veterans when they come home. It's awful how the government treats our veterans and that is what the movie is trying to tell here and it really works at the end. My main issues with this film were its presentation. None of the technical aspects of the film stand out at all. The cinematography and music are fine. The editing is fine. All of it is fine but it could be better. They also had this ugly filter on whenever Michael K. Williams is on screen. The film's tension is pretty good though. There were definitely points especially at the end where I could really feel nervous about the characters. This is based on a true story so most people know what happened but you still feel your heart racing towards the end. There were times though when the film was trying to be tense and it just didn't come through for me. I would recommend checking this out whenever the film hits theaters if you're interested in Boyega or the story this film is based on.,/review/rw8500028/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2022,IboChild,7," Decent Drama Reminiscent of ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and ""Fruitvale Station""
","Based on a true story, ""Breaking"" is competently made with generally strong performances by the cast, but doesn't quite live up to its potential. The problem seems to be one mostly of structure and pacing. The tension builds in key moments, but doesn't sustain itself throughout the film. The elements are there, but the filmmakers don't quite have a handle on how to incorporate them into the film. The limited use of locations is very effective. Unless you're really interested in the subject matter or are fans of John Boyega or other members of the cast, it's perhaps best to wait until it reaches the small screen. In other words, it's not a film that demands to be seen on the big screen.",/review/rw8500028/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2022,arungeorge13,7," A heist-hostage thriller with more-than-usual depth! [+70%]
","Breaking/892 is a film I'd like to refer to as an emotionally candid hostage thriller. The storytelling follows a non-linear style, slowly giving us details into what went wrong in ex-Marine Brian Brown-Easley's life and what led him to ""hold up a bank"". Writers Abi Damaris Corbin (who directs) and Kwame Kwei-Armah punctuate the screenplay with sharp, hard-hitting dialogue that convey its upright (but underlying) intentions. John Boyega's performance as the protagonist is terrific, slowly and steadily drawing you in. He also gets good support from Nicole Beharie, Michael Kenneth Williams (RIP), and London Covington. The telephonic exchanges between Brian and his daughter prove to be the film's emotional spine while the somewhat thrilling hostage situation keeps us rooting for Brian's survival. The climax is moving too, even if you can predict a particular aspect of it.",/review/rw8500028/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2022,statuskuo,6," A Great Effort Fallen To Mediocre Structure
","Those of you who worried about John Boyega's career post ""Star Wars"" fame, need not worry. He is at the top of his game in portraying Brian Easley Brown, a Marine who enters a bank and holds its employees hostage. Two employees to be exact: Estel (Nicole Biharie) & Rosa (Selenis Leyva). Based on a true story, this hostage taker isn't there for money but some greater message he had conjured up in his mind would gather attention (which is seems to have been lost, even though it only happened in 2017). Boyega's Brian is respectful and courteous which will lead to a lot of comparisons to ""Dog Day Afternoon"" but that also has some of the flaws. We know he isn't ""dangerous"" simply because he makes it very clear he isn't going to hurt anyone just himself. What he is drawing light to is that he is a veteran and that he is incensed when discovering he had been cut off from veteran benefits due to an issue created by him (real life story). In the movie, they depict it as a clerical issue. There isn't much more to say here because there isn't much more going on. He feels tied to his ex-wife and most definitely to a daughter that he made promises to and need to fulfill those promises.",/review/rw8500028/?ref_=tt_urv

","Rivaling Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon and Washington in John Q Boyega puts out a Tour De Force performance in this touching and all too common story about a guy stepped on by the government. Being a true story makes this movie cut even deeper. Depending on your political take in today's ALL TOO RACIST CULTURE you may make up your mind about what those in power chose to do to end this situation. But, I thought immediately about Pacino and Washington's performance...But I actually FELT something for this character, although I didn't agree with his methods!! Better than good movie ....
