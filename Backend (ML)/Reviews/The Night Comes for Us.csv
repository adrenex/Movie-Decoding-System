2 November 2004,ctowner1,," Awesome thought-provoking show
","With all the pap that's passing for entertainment these days, this show stands out all the more. Week after week this show tossed out thought provoking questions in all areas of our society - medical, criminal, religious, philosophical - any aspect of our society and lives was fair game. And it wrapped these questions around the lives of a hugely talented cast of fully realized characters. The show also had the courage to not play it safe. It routinely tackled ""hot button"" issues from abortion, to homosexuality, to belief in God, to constitutional protection of rights. Is there ANY show on TV now that comes close to this??",/review/rw1185890/?ref_=tt_urv

2 May 2003,talking_tree,," Just lovely
","When ever I open the television and Picket fences is coming, I get a satisfactioned smile on my face and I crawl into sofa to enjoy. Today I saw the very emotional episode ""Frogman returns"" and now I´m sure that this is one of the greatest American series ever showd onto the daylight. Like many others have said, it has something for everyone. Drama, jokes, family moments, moral questions, children, teens, funny moments, emotional moments... LIFE. And it hasn´t really aged at all. I highly recommend it to everyone.",/review/rw1185890/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2003,tfrizzell,," Not Always a Bed of Roses.
","Sometimes a very intense drama, but sometimes very light-hearted, ""Picket Fences"" stayed around on CBS from 1992-1996 and stayed under the radar on Friday nights and usually had just enough momentum to win the night. The show took place in a small Wisconsin town that was anything, but normal. Usually one family (led by sheriff Tom Skeritt and doctor Kathy Baker) took center-stage. The children (Holly Marie Combs, Justin Shenkarow and Adam Wylie) also became key elements as problems for under-aged people were explored on several occasions. The townspeople (county judge Ray Walston, lawyers Don Cheadle and Fyvush Finkel, deputies Lauren Holly and Costas Mandylor, secretary Zelda Rubinstein and mayor Marlee Matlin) would end up helping to create some of the strangest situations you could ever imagine. Up and down the whole way, I enjoyed the series for the most part due to its creativity and its black humor. Usually the episodes had something to say, but sometimes they would cover their messages in thick sugar. 4 stars out of 5.",/review/rw1185890/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2001,blamar,," excellent study of family life in a small town
","Another David E Kelley gem that won several Emmys. A wonderful series about Rome Wisconsin. It follows the lives of the sheriff, his wife, the doctor, their 3 children and their circle of friends. It shows them dealing with the frustrations and joys of everyday life, dealing with the town ""characters"" including, an ambitious deputy sheriff..a young woman trying to make it in a traditionally male profession, a tough but not terribly bright deputy who had an affair with the female mayor, an Alzheimer affected gentleman who had good and bad moments as the mayor, a grandstanding Jewish lawyer who took cases that were colorful and controversial, a world weary judge, and an insecure coroner. This is a wonderful show that stands the test of time.",/review/rw1185890/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2013,Steed-2,10," David E. Kelley's masterpiece
","First of all, I must admit I'm not a big fan of David E. Kelley. Some of his famous TV shows are average in my opinion, just to enjoy one episode on a lazy Sunday afternoon and that's all. I would never buy them on DVD because all the TV shows I own on DVD must be above average, have to be something special. And Picket Fences was something really special!!!",/review/rw1185890/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 1999,angie-27,," the best ever
","i think this was the best series ever to be on television.  even after all these years off the air, i still love it.  never before or since has a show made my think as much as this one always did.  the writers tackled a lot of real and interesting issues, and usually made the viewer see it from both sides.  it could be the funniest show on tv, or the most touching, or the most thought provoking.  over the course of its run, it made me laugh, cry, get angry, smile, sympathize, and sometimes even hate.  as for the cast, they were great.  especially worthy of mention are tom skerrit, fyvish finkle, ray walston, lauren holly, holly-marie combs, don cheadle, marlee matlin, and kelly connel.  but the best, in my opinion, was kathy baker. she was always so good, even though i didn't always like or agree with her character, jill brock.  i don't know the actual episode titles, but a few of my favorite eps were: the dancing bandit; cupid; the green bay chopper; the murder trial when jimmy was the foreman; the cow babies; mayor kills carjacker and mayor explodes; man who can't recognize people kills his brother; howard buss dies (i cried); the shoe fetish (can you believe rachel harris stood up); parkinson's disease.  another thing about the show, it always had great guest stars.  anyway, i miss rome.",/review/rw1185890/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2005,lgmark,," Each episode was a treasure
","Each episode pitted some sort of preconceived notion of what is ""right"" against what is the law, theocracy, or medical ethics. This was a show that would raise you to cheer and have you crying all withing one episode. Some episodes were emotionally crushing. I can see why it didn't last on TV very long. It wasn't that it didn't receive great acclaim, but that there are only so many wrenching episodes that one can write about before it's ""washed up"". David Kelly knew this and it's one reason that it was on late at night as well as why it only lasted for a few seasons. One of the truly great Television shows. The ""Seinfeld"" of Dramas. I wish it would come out in DVD.",/review/rw1185890/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2002,dtucker86,," the best party sequence ever
",What a great show. Watching Picket Fences is like watching old friends come over for dinnner. These are characters you can laugh and cry with and feel good to watch. Tom Skerritt Kathy Baker Lauren Holly Fyvush Finkel and the late Ray Walston were all excellent. This show deserves to have a place in tv history because of Jimmy's birthday episode. Let me set the scene. Jimmy is suffering from gas REAL BAD and his wife blindolds him and leads him into the family room. He thinks he is all alone and then lifts his leg and man he really lets one! It is terrific. It is the first show to feature an authentic wind breakage on the air. Wow what great acting! This is TV history that no one should miss. Then Jimmy's wife comes back in the room and takes off his blindfold and she sees the room is full of people who all run out! I don't think there is another actor who could have passed gas the way Tom Skerrit did in this wonderful episode. Laurence Olivier would have been very proud.,/review/rw1185890/?ref_=tt_urv

","For the love of all things good in this world...RELEASE ""PICKET FENCES"" on DVD. It was the BEST show EVER in the history of television.  All of you fans of ""Picket Fences"" out there in imdb world, write David E. Kelley, or CBS, or TNN--whoever owns the rights to the show--and DEMAND it be released. There is no justice in the world until this is done.",/review/rw1185890/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2009,sharkey197,10," David Kelley's Masterpiece
","I was an addicted Picket Fences fan while it was playing on TV. The first three seasons were so atypical of television that it redeemed the rest of the garbage shown. Season Four suffered terribly at Kelley's absence, but it still had some good episodes. I recently purchased Season 1 on DVD and realized it had been two years since it had been released? Where's the rest of them? Why is every schlock TV series on DVD and not this? I've read it has to do with music rights and disputes over that. Actually, if you really want to, you can purchase all four seasons from various sites. The DVD discs are video transfer and the quality looks like video transfer, but if you really crave the series it will assuage your yearning until something better comes out. There are two episodes missing from season 3 and the first disc of Season 4 had a lot of break up interference, but the rest of season 4 was almost DVD quality and was captioned to boot. Superlative acting, exceptional writing, thought provoking and a haunting theme music. Picket Fences fans, unite!",/review/rw1185890/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2004,torben-16,," A TV series in a class of it's own
","Television here in Denmark are currently making a re-run, bringing back fond memories. It is by far the best TV-series I can remember. The plot is filled with interesting twists and presenting a moral dilemma with views both pro- and con. It forced you to consider questions of many importans nature such as child abuse, biggatry, active death help, problems with your kids, ex-parents and what have you. I use to watch it with my 10 year son (who loved Wambauch by the way) and discussing the contect afterwards. Not many TV-series will provide such material. The episode with the sheriff's boy dreaming of Maxine in sexy underwear and a Gameboy - and the something ""explodes"" is a very fine example of a young man's first ""wet dream"" and a good starting point for a father/son conversation. - A league of it's own and not what you would expect from an american production.",/review/rw1185890/?ref_=tt_urv

4 January 2022,KenW-3,8," Best Bad or Worst Best
","Loved the show and watched it religiously when it was first aired. Now that I'm re-watching the series again, the many, many flaws are clear. The writing is simplistic and plot lines are quite often a stretch, to the point of being ridiculous. And how many times do I see Tom Skerrit with that quizzical and confused look on his face with a sidelong glance as he appears to practically tip over? Even with all of that, it is a terrific series and always entertaining. One of my favorites.",/review/rw1185890/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2000,Nozz,," Then one week I said ""Good Lord, it's a play!""
","A lot of the time, Kelley used his sense of absurdity as a crutch... a dwarf with an elephant, a pig-to-human liver transplant... but I remember one week when Richard Kiley showed up in the role of the father, there was a smidgen of plot about some traffic violation or something, but then the characters sat down and began to talk, and the whole episode was nothing but the unfolding of their feelings and relationships.  The series had been going on for some time, characters had been established, and it looked as if Kelley were saying ""What's Eugene O'Neill got that I haven't got?""  And by golly, I think he did carry it off.",/review/rw1185890/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2013,jpyrrho,10," Most interesting show in my opinion....!
","Picket Fences was a excellent TV show. It brings out polemical issues on a day-to-day life in that little town called Rome. It makes us think, and think a lot. Religion, sexuality, abortion, drugs, poverty and other aspects were carefully written in there. Sometimes I watch an episode, in 2013, and find it extremely polemical and I just imagine how would that cause back in 1992. Crimes are brought up just as much, and the characters have their stories and evolve beautifully. I just find it terrific.Unfortunately, only the first season has been released in DVD, I truly don't get why the other's haven't. The Brock family looks so real in there, which makes it even greater. It is definitely worth-watching and I wish it became more popular in this new generation (me included)! I made two of my friends watch it, and they do not regret it.",/review/rw1185890/?ref_=tt_urv

12 September 2022,jarrodmcdonald-1,," Rome if you want to
","Looking back on it now, this series was very much ahead of its time. One reason I think Picket Fences works better than other David E. Kelley programs is that it is not as urban as the other ones. Because it is set in this remote midwestern community, it's sort of like a modern-day version of The Andy Griffith Show, except the topics are a lot more scandalous.",/review/rw1185890/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 1999,Coxer99,," Picket Fences
","An entertaining drama that had its good years and its mediocre. All in all, it was mediocre show. The show worked because it didn't glorify the law like shows like ""Law & Order,"" where people spouted off references to old classics as a matter of policy. Here, you have characters like Finkel's Wambaugh, who you're not even sure knows any old cases. Finkel stole countless episodes, as did Chapelle, who since the shows' end, has found better material and bigger roles. Wonderful! Skerritt didn't work for me. I couldn't take him seriously in the role of the Chief of Rome, Iowa. An actor like Robert Urich would have been better. Baker, however, was magic in every episode. She delivered her lines with passion and a sort of romantic sentimentality that is rare on many television dramas. The biggest joy in the show's run was seeing what crusty old judge Ray Walston was going to do next. Walston sunk his teeth into the role of Judge Henry Bone and he bit a chunk out of every episode. Her won much deserved Emmys and kept his long career going.",/review/rw1185890/?ref_=tt_urv

","Just after ""Boston Public"" wrapped with Kathy Baker held hostage in the basement, I wondered if I'd ever see ""Dr. Jill Brock"" in action again. A chance scan of TNN's weekday schedule brought a pleasant surprise: Five days of ""Picket Fences""! (Time for the VCR and popcorn as the search for ""The Serial Bather"" starts again.) First one seen: A ""Show & Tell"" turned into a hunt for ""The Green Bay Chopper,"" with Kenny and Max drawing on two Krycek-like FBI agents.",/review/rw1185890/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2003,storw1,," great show!
","I enjoyed the show ""picket fences"", especially the first several years, up until the change from current events to concentrating on individual characters(and relationships). When the show focused on different opinions of what was going on in the world and having the same thing happen in Rome was great! I particularly enjoyed the ""religious"" controversy with jimmy his wife and kids when jimmy said at the very best he was an agnostic. The show was great up until that change and I feel that's what did it in. Still would buy it if it ever comes out on DVD, but only the first few seasons.",/review/rw1185890/?ref_=tt_urv

21 July 2017,selffamily,6," meh
","The problem with a much-loved TV series is that it tends to become so formulaic that you can pretty well predict the outcome of nearly all episodes. I used to watch this when it came on TV, but I don't know how many series or episodes. However, now that i have the chance to revisit the town (city?) of Rome via DVD I am doing so. Let's start with Rome, is it a town or a city? In one episode, the then-mayor calls it a city, and they certainly seem to have all the facilities of a city, with a seemingly large hospital - doing transplants no less - and scores of cops with a sheriff and two deputies. I don't know how these things run in rural USA but in many countries that would point to a city. The sheriff and his wife seem to have no conflict of interest issues, even when she storms into the jail and demands the key to release her father following his arrest. I can't stand the woman, so I'm biased, although I recognise good acting, but surely at some point the sheriff could say no? Fyvesh Finkel is the star in my eyes, he is ""a character"" and lifts the mood considerably. The family are pretty mediocre, and although the middle son is obviously headed for a juvenile facility at some point in his life, (if not jail), they act a good family life. The little boy, with the ears, appears to have gone out of acting now, which is a pity because he would have done well. The two deputies are pretty well rogue, doing what they want, with whom and where it pleases them. It gives some concern about the standard of law and order in small town USA. The stories are for the most part good, with some unusual quirks thrown in - a dwarf running away with an elephant comes to mind. The cast is sterling, they play their parts so well, you cannot tell they're acting, which is probably why some are so irritating. On the whole, in my personal opinion, it's a good series, holds the attention, and draws the viewer back again and again. If I want to slap some of the characters, that's tribute to the acting ability and the writing, not the actors. I know it's some 25 years old, and apart from the shoulder pads, it has stood the test of time well.",/review/rw1185890/?ref_=tt_urv

","Unfortunately due to my hours I wasn't able to watch it when it was originally aired, but I would hear my family mention it in passing about what they watched. Then in the latter 90's I was flipping around to try to find something to watch in the early afternoon after I got off work and came upon a program where the courthouse of a small town was under siege from American Indians I believe and from that day I was hooked. I loved this program, yes some parts of it were weird to crazy, but it was very enjoyable. Yes they went through quite a few mayors, and as much as they died off I wouldn't want to be a mayor there, but I would love to move to a town like that.",/review/rw1185890/?ref_=tt_urv
