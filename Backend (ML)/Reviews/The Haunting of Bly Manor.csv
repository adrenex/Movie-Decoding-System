10 October 2020,durham100,8," People need to be more aware.
","So many people saying it isn't horror - well they are right. Haunted house tales are not horror, they are ghost stories. This is slow in building, atmospheric and extremely intelligent. The performances are wonderful, the kids especially, and once you get to where the characters don't know where they are in the story you will really need to think. This is everything a ghost story should be. For those diappaointed check out The Haunting from 1963 - you don't see a single spook or apparition in that movie but to this day it still scares the heck out of me. That is a ghost story.
Horror movies are lazy, they don't require the viewer to do anything because they just aim to make you jump or gross out. Ghost stories however, they get the hairs on your neck prickling up and make you check behind you now and again - just in case. This is great stuff and I hope so much there will be more.
Well done to all involved.",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2020,katharina-muellner,7," Just OK
","I looooved the Hill house and was looking forward to the same creators producing a new masterpiece, but in my opinion they didn't.
The first 4 episodes are sooo slow and borderline boring, to the point where I almost stopped watching. Glad I didn't, because the 2nd half was way better. But all together it didn't hit a home run for me.
Not bad, just not great.",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,geeboy-48854,5," Dont expect another Hill House
","I have to say if I didn't see Hill House prior to this I probably would never have sat through the whole series of Bly since its really not even close to how good Hill House was. It's also really disjointed, slow and confusing so you can really tell that Mike Flanagan didn't work nearly as closely on this one as he did with the Hill. In general Im a little disappointed and frustrated but still a huge Flanagan fan and will continue to watch all his future projects. I also wouldnt really call this is a horror, more like a mystery/drama but it does have its share of ""ghosts"". Maybe I should have watched Bly first and then Hill so if youve seen neither I would recommend going in that order so you end up with the best series.",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2020,mr_bickle_the_pickle,8," Its about grief
","I've seen some complaints that the show is slow. But you know what, its a gothic ghost story. Its supposed to be more atmospheric than straight up action packed and so in that regard, I think it delivers. It is still horror. Ive also seen people call it a gothic love story and even the show hints (at the end) that all love stories are ghost stories. But my interpretation while watching it, is that its a story about grief. And how that manifests in each of us. How we're literally haunted by our past like Dani. How we become the worst versions of ourselves like Henry. How we live in denial like Mrs Grose. How we become bitter like Peter Quint. How we can get lost in our memories (good or bad) because its all we have left. I think its a very beautiful and tragic story when we look at it from that perspective rather than solely focusing on the spook factor.",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2020,southdavid,7," Phantom Menace
","A year ago, I watched and enjoyed ""The Haunting of Hill House"" so was very happy to find that the spiritual sequel had made it to completion before covid shutdown. Much like last years effort, the scarier aspects are just trappings really, with ""Bly Manor"" being a tragic, or perhaps a series of tragic, love stories - with ghosts.",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2020,teiixeiral,8," On it's own, it's a beautifully emotional story about grief and love.
","I loved Hill House but this isn't Hill House, it's Bly Manor. As soon as I got that into my head I was able to enjoy Bly Manor for what it is.",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2020,zkonedog,10," Distinctly Different From Its Predecessor--But Equally Mesmerizing
","After having thoroughly enjoyed--to the tune of 10/10 stars--The Haunting of Hill House a few years back, I was shocked to see the middling-to-negative reviews of this follow-up anthology effort. After completing The Haunting of Bly Manor, however, I believe I have a much better grasp on what is transpiring: this second effort is not a jump-scare, bump-in-the-night horror show (granted, Hill House was much more than ""just"" that, too). No, Bly Manor is equal parts mystery and love story. Fortunately, it is every bit as compelling as its predecessor.",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2020,aylwardpaul,8," Gothic Romance
","If we're doing comparisons, then I preferred this to Hill House. I thought that HH had a muddled ending, whereas Bly has a perfectly bittersweet ending.",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2020,actualbookworm,10," ""The Haunting of Bly Manor""
","Well, I didn't expect to be crying my heart out for this series, The Haunting Of Bly Manor. This is definitely much lighter than The Haunting of Hill House. Hill House would scare the living s**t out of you and Bly Manor would melt the living s**t out of your heart. This is a borderline between horror and romance but mainly romance. It will remind you of the days of Gothic Romance, say The Phantom Of The Opera or Dracula, and the like.",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2020,alexacz,5," perfectly splendid, not
","Don't get me wrong, it was a positively great and enjoyable show, up until it wasn't. About halfway through it just gets perfectly tedious and you get an itch in your finger to press fast forward. A bit too much dream hopping and repeating the same scenes over and over and over and she slept and she woke and she walked and I was wishing for her to just sleep and never wake again.. so frustrating! And then there was the perfectly annoying narrator, it was supposed to be taking place in the 80s, or did I mishear and it was the 18th century? who talks like that? I could say that about all the charecters but I've said enough. Judge for yourselves my luvz and stup the bladdy overrating..",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2020,kaelynkhowe,10," I loved it
","I don't understand why so many people are rating this poorly? It definitely had its creepy moments and honestly, I enjoyed this storyline more than the last version!
I think people need to stop comparing it to the first season and rate it as it's own thing.
Please do not listen to the bad reviews and give it a go!",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2020,imuckenschnabl,8," Turn of the Screw
","Very nice and spooky new adaptation of Henry James' classic gothic ghost novel . Well well done! For me a 8,5/10",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2020,HeroOfTomorrow,9," Beautiful, sad - a haunting experience... in a good way.
","The Haunting of Hill House was an allegorical show, which kept the horror elements at the forefront. While I absolutely loved that season and the way it handled its subject matter, I'd daresay Bly Manor is even better, in large part due to its subtlety.",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2020,exisce,10," Thank you, Mike Flanagan!
","I am writing this review after watching this show for two times in a row in six days. ""The Haunting of Bly Manor"" is a masterpiece, that's all I have to say. An outstanding cinematographic work, which brings together a great script, amazing setting and dialogues, excellent actors, remarkable music, beautiful cinematography, and everything else that goes into an intelligent first-class movie.",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2020,Genti25,9," I'm being held hostage by a story
","I know for a fact that some people will not appreciate this story as much as Hill House, and that could be for a number of reasons. But I personally believe that this story will have an even longer lasting effect after watching it.
I loved what Flanagan did with Hill House, but Bly Manor somehow cuts even deeper into emotion. Without spoiling anything, the very last shot of the last episode alone packs so much emotion within, that a part of me will always be thinking about it.
The acting and the technical aspects are all masterful of course, but we already knew they were going to be.
It truly is you, me and us with this show. We're all together experiencing what a truly and thoroughly touching story made with and for love feels like.",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2020,elliotjeory,4," Pretentious babble
",It's really boring. The first episode was good. Then it went very slow. Some of the characters are terrible. Really bad. I liked the nanny but that's it. Really corny too.,/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2020,brandonneicke,8," Solid
","It's definitely not perfectly splendid. It's better than most ghost crap I watch. It was not as good as hill house unfortunately. Hill house was very intense and quite frankly terrifying. This is a little confusing but still has quality cinema to it. Very well acting and directing, writing is good to but the story is spotty. The last creepy show I watched was the outsider and it was much better than this. Still worthy of a watch, especially in the month of October :-)",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2020,audjo1999,3," The more I think about it the more disappointed I am
","I loved Haunting of Hill House. Everything about it was so well executed. However, wanting to give this series a fair chance, I went into this with no intention of comparing it to its predecessor but it just falls so short.",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2020,diescobarmdq,8," Get the tissues ready
","It's a love story, with some ghosts in it, so Don't expect jump scares like in Hill House.
The music, the acting, the setting, the dialogues, it's all very eerie and hipnotic. Each episode explains something relevant for each character, and by episode 8, you get the whole picture of what is really going on. There are many mysteries with each character going through their own drama and grief.
Ultimately, it's a tragic love story.
A beautiful one.",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2020,Calicodreamin,8," Beautifully made
","Another well made series, the storyline is captivating, the cinematography is beautiful, and the acting is great. The emotions conveyed in this story, and I agree that it is a love story, are breathtaking. Honestly well made in all accounts.",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2020,evelienvelden,4," Slow,boring and overrated
","Loved the hill house version. This one is totally different and doesn't come near the previous one. It is boring, not scary at all, the story is really bad and very slow. Wanted to quit when it became really boring after a couple of episodes but didn't. Watched it all, wish I didn't. It's a ridiculous love story. Waste of my time. I normally love horror ,especially the older movies but this has more a drama/love /mystery genre instead of horror. They should have left that word out.",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2020,mrb223,4," The watching of paint dry
","The haunting of hill house sent chills up my spine. This is quite opposite. You're lucky to get one horror scene that scares you per episode. The story is bland as well, acting is hit or miss. Nothing early on entices you to keep watching.",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2020,Pairic,8," Dark Gothic Tale
","The Haunting Of Bly Manor: While you do get some disturbing scenes of violent, vengeful ghosts the Horror in this series is mostly of a psychological nature. A sense of dread gradually build up even though the narrative does not unfold in a linear manner. We get flashbacks, flashbacks with flashbacks, even an episode which goes back to the origin story of the Haunting in the Seventeenth Century. Characters also dream when they are possessed by ghosts or even when they are ghosts themselves they are caught in recursive memories akin to timeslips or time-loops. This is very much a Gothic drama and while it does drag at times (and perhaps could have lost an episode) it is an impressive and worthwhile attempt at adapting The Turn Of The Screw for the screen. The Showrunner is Mike Flanagan who Directs/Writes the first episode. Nine episodes on Netflix. 8/10.",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2020,lanycera,9," I see how this can have so many mixed reviews.
","8.5 stars for me. It's very different to Haunting of Hill House. Less ""horror"" and more a story of love and obsession, ghosts and loss. In fact, it reminds me a bit of Haruki Murakami's stories.
While I thought the first episodes were a bit lacking, the second half is definitely interesting - pretty much from ""Altar of the Dead"" onwards.",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2020,paul_mossop-96426,3," If You're British this is all wrong. (Perfectly Dreadful)
","From the way they talk to the posh children using words from an adult script, from the obviously American/Canadian telephone in the "" British Manor House kitchen"" the two children Miles & Flora, sound precocious as though their last film was the original Mary Poppins, Infact you get the feeling Dick Van Dyke will jump out at any moment giving it his best fake dreadful Cockney Accent covered in Soot! Floras repetitions of ""perfectly Splendid"" annoying beyond belief! Seems poorly written, and researched, not a patch on Hill House..( I know it's different) it's laboured and dare I say after 3 episodes slow, dull, cheap & boring.",/review/rw6169508/?ref_=tt_urv
