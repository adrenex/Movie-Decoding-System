","Alright, 'Homefront' may not offer a strong premise or a power-packed Script, but what it has, is, Jason Statham. The Action-Star rocks in his portrayal of a hero, who defeats each & every snob out there & refuses to lose, ever. ",/review/rw3145904/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2014,BeneCumb,7," Nothing really new, but above-average entertainment
","Single ex-agent with a child, settling down in a new closed place where a self-claimed boss has set his own rules - there are (and definitely will be) lots of similar stories, about past, present and future. As it is difficult to add a new angle or approach, it is usually acting and solution of issues that counts, are they logical, or just ridiculous and unrealistic. Homefront has evidently more pluses than minuses - pleasant performances by ""the good guys"" - Jason Statham as a caring but tough father Phil Broker and Izabela Vidovic as sensitive but tough Maddy, realistic atmosphere, catchy fights, meaningful use of violence... True, ""the bad guys"" are too plain, the ending has predictable structure and elements, and there are scenes not necessary for the general course of events, but absence of dudikoffs-seagals and torpid chases and fights is already a valuable feature. It is nice to see that Statham as an action hero has followed in the footsteps of e.g. Mel Gibson and Bruce Willis.",/review/rw3145904/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2013,cousbrojs,7," It's not your usual Statham film
","""Transporter"" rocketed Statham's name as a well rounded action star. Since then, most of his action films have felt the same, just with a different title. That was my mind set going into watch this film. ""Homefront"", isn't your usual Statham film, and it's nice to see it play out the way it did. A change of pace for Statham movies, and hopefully a turning point for the actor. But let's keep things simple: Story: Good Acting: Good Action: Very Good Pacing: Good If you're looking for a good action film with a lot of heart, watch this.

26 November 2018,octomancer,7," Solid action fillum
","There is nothing wrong with this film. I thought JS's acting was pretty good. Compares favourably to other action stars' attempts over the years. I really enjoyed seeing Kate Bosworth, Winona Ryder and James Franco playing against type. Franco can be a bit hit and miss, he shines in the right roles, but others he struggles with (Annapolis for example). Definitely a hit here, his bad guy had more nuance than was strictly written into the part. Deserves a bit more than the 6.5 it's got as I write this.",/review/rw3145904/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2015,g-bodyl,8," A Good Action Film!
","Homefront is a solid action movie, and even though I typically enjoy Jason Statham movies, it's nice to see a change of pace for him. It's a different kind of film he partakes here. There are still many action scenes, but this is more of a slow-burn thriller that has an explosive finale. It's weird to see Statham playing a character that has existing family, because I'm so used to him working solo. As action movies goes, I have seen better, but I have also seen far worst.",/review/rw3145904/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2020,monkeysgalore,8," Essentially a Much Darker and More Violent Burt Reynolds Movie; One of Statham's Best
","Another Jason Statham vehicle, Homefront is one of his better performances and films. Boasting lots riveting action scenes and a great, if unlikely, villain in the form of James Franco of all people.",/review/rw3145904/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2016,davispittman,6," Boosted some by good performances
","Homefront truly is boosted higher by good performances by the cast. Winona Ryder really did a great job as the skanky bad girl Sheryl, she and James Franco had a really good chemistry and kinda bad guy dynamic going throughout the film. As for Jason Statham, he was perfect for his starring role, I mean could NOT have picked a better action star to lead this movie! He is sexy, rugged, tough as friggin nails, and overall a real badass, but a badass with a good big heart. Him and his daughter really had great father/daughter chemistry here, you could tell that they really had a great relationship and loved and cared about one another, which was needed for a movie like this one. Kate Bosworth is pretty darn good as well, she is almost unrecognizable here, Redneck trailer trash, anyways, she plays a well written character well here. Now as for the movie itself as a whole, it's kinda average action movie fare, nothing to distinguish it from the rest in this genre. The action and shooting sequences are pretty run of the mill, nothing all too special to see unfortunately. The plot has some nice attachments to it, like the father daughter relationship/connection that I mentioned before. Homefront tries it's hardest to be this edgy awesome new action film, but it did not accomplish that goal. It's just too average to be called awesome or even all that edgy. I mean yah there is time of crude language because of the degenerate characters, and yes, it has some rough violence to some scenes, but that still doesn't make it all that edgy. But hey, it's not a total loss, good performances all around! 6/10 for Homefront.",/review/rw3145904/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2014,santiagonunez16,9," It's a Jason Statham movie, what were you expecting?
","At first glance most Jason Statham movies are pretty much about the same thing. Some quiet, keep to himself guy finds himself using exceptional fighting skills against the bad guys. Turns our he's usually the fastest gun, in this case fist in the west. This time Jason Statham is a retired-likely forced retired DEA agent who raising his daughter after his wife and her mother pass away. They move to a quiet town somewhere in Louisiana and settle in. When his daughter gets harassed by the local bully in school, she drop kicks him into another dimension--hey, she did warn him before she broke the fat tub of lard's nose. Next we meet his mother, a very loud, unrecognizable Kate Bosworth who disrespects both daughter and Statham. When she fails at intimidating him by having her husband try to assault him in the school parking lot-a one-two takedown by Statham, she enlists the help of local meth kingpin brother, James Franco. There is a back story in the beginning and some actual character development dealing with Statham's former life and an undercover cop. Frank Zito, who in my opinion is very under rated both as a character actor and villain in this case, steals the opening sequence as motorcycle gang leader bent on revenge. This movie has some exceptional fight scenes, explosions, and very intense show down between Franco and Statham that was actually pretty surprising and satisfying. This is a Jason Statham movie but a strong supporting cast of Franco and Zito steal the show as both small time and big time antagonists. Action fans will enjoy this latest blend of action and drama from the last true action star of this genre. At 100 minutes, its just long enough to hold your interest. Surprisingly, Statham's last few films have contained some human elements to their stories. While it's not going to win any major awards, this movie is sure to please action fans and others looking for a decent night out at the movies.",/review/rw3145904/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2017,Tweekums,7," A school yard punch up quickly escalates in the Jason Statham action thriller
","Phil Broker was a DEA agent who went deep undercover in a biker gang to expose their drug dealing operation; now he has retired to a quiet town in the Louisiana bayous. He is hoping for a quiet life with his young daughter Maddy but an apparently minor incident rapidly escalates to the point that his old foes are coming after him. A schoolyard bully picks on Maddy but gets more than he bargained for when she gives him a bloody nose. The boy's mother pushes her husband into confronting Broker but he just ends up being put on the floor. This just makes matters worse; after her husband's humiliation she gets her vicious crystal meth dealing brother, 'Gator', involved. He discovers Broker's true identity and decides that he can use this to get the bikers, who want revenge against Broker, to get them to distribute his product. When they arrive mayhem is inevitable.",/review/rw3145904/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2013,A_Different_Drummer,8," A real ""guilty pleasure""
","I enjoyed this film. But, to be fair, they have been making this specific type of film since the 70s and I enjoyed them then, I enjoy them now. (Back in the day, this would have been a Charles Bronson film, or Chuck Norris film, or a Lee Marvin film). No I will not mislead you or tell you untruths. This is not an original story. It is a specific story which, depending on the actors and the direction, either works or does not work. Films like this never make it to the Oscars and often they don't do well in reviews either. But they can be fun. If you read the other reviews you already know the backstory -- the reason this specific formula was resurrected from the Script Graveyard and given the A-List treatment -- it was written/developed by Sly Stallone. Sly is too slick and too smart to let any property sit idle, so he ""slyly"" (sorry) picked Statham to play the lead. Once again, before anyone takes exception, I will note that my review of Hummingbird -- the first major film where Statham showed his acting ""chops"" -- was very popular in this database, so I feel entitled to make a final call. Which is this -- good movie. Could have been great, but it did OK, considering the part was not originally written for the actor who played the main role. And the heavies were (to be fair) just a tad over-written. I mean, if you have ever watched Justfied, you already know that the friendly overweight woman who runs the General Store in back mountain country is probably a serial killer. And the local deputy is corrupt and related to the judge. So, with such a rich assortment to draw upon, why import heavies? Final comment: I thought Izabela Vidovic as the daughter stole every scene she was in, most especially the opening (which arguably -- and this is not unusual in action films -- was the best single setup in the production) where she whips the snot out of a local bully who is twice her size after patiently and earnestly explaining to him that she warned him -- twice.",/review/rw3145904/?ref_=tt_urv

","I love Winona Ryder, in my opinion she is one of the sexiest actresses ever. Can you guess what made me go see this movie? Yes, it was Winona. I loved watching her in this film, she was great and looks awesome. I have also decided that James Franco is for real. He can play nice guys, mean guys and doped up drug dealers with ease. I never miss one of his films. ",/review/rw3145904/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2021,classicsoncall,7," ""Now are you connecting the dots?""
","Say what you will, but I liked this one. I think it was the kid Maddy (Izabela Vidovic) that won me over, she wasn't annoying and held her own for the most part. For Jason Statham, this wasn't much of a workout since he's been here and done that before, but this time out he looked more like just a regular guy. There's a fair share of recognizable names here and almost all are bad guys, leaving the women in somewhat of an ambiguous position at the finale. Like Winona Ryder's character Sheryl, and Kate Bosworth's Cassie. They started out pretty much as trailer trash and wound up helping Maddy in a tough spot by going with their maternal instincts to lend a hand. For Gator (James Franco), there were unintended consequences galore when he decided to try and deal with Cyrus Hanks (Frank Grillo), that guy had his own agenda without Gator moving in on his meth trafficking. I also liked Broker's (Statham) guy Teedo (Omar Benson Miller), applying new meaning to the term 'stick a fork in it'. The whole meth shop milieu was a bit too reminiscent of ""Breaking Bad"", but it did provide for a wild and fiery finale. Not a bad way of connecting all those dots.",/review/rw3145904/?ref_=tt_urv

","HOMEFRONT is the latest action flick from modern-day action star Jason Statham, who seems to be churning these movies out with a monotonous regularity.

29 November 2013,zardoz-13,8," Statham Kicks Butt Again!!!
","Don't let the title of the latest Jason Statham thriller ""Homefront"" deceive you. This is no soap opera about life in the boondocks. ""Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead"" director Gary Fleder and ""Cobra"" scenarist Sylvester Stallone should have entitled it ""Hell On A Bayou."" This exciting but formulaic revenge saga pits a retired DEA Agent against a murderous bunch of bikers and rednecks who resemble the hellions in the ""Sons of Anarchy"" television series. Naturally, Statham plays the conscientious DEA Agent who witnessed a gross miscarriage of justice that his superior defends as 'protocol.' After an explosive drug bust at a New Orleans' nightclub, our undercover hero's brothers-in-blue mow down a clueless biker in a fusillade of gunfire. Apparently, they suspected that the poor slob was reaching for a concealed weapon during a stand-off. The blood-splattered experience sickened our protagonist enough that he resigned from the agency and settled down in a two-bit Louisiana town to raise his young daughter. While he wants to put as much distance between his past as he can, our hero doesn't realize that escaping his bullet-riddled past is easier said than done. Basically, ""Homefront"" shares a lot in common with a witness relocation thriller, except the hero here is a cop rather than an eye-witness. Stallone adapted Chuck Logan's novel, but the filmmakers have altered the setting from Minnesota to Louisiana. A former Vietnam veteran, Logan has published eight novels about his protagonist Phil Broker, and ""Homefront"" appeared in print back in 2009. As it turns out, ""Homefront"" provides Statham with an ideal vehicle, and its rural setting and dastardly villains have the flavor of an Elmore Leonard novel. Co-stars James Franco, Winona Ryder, Clancy Brown, Kate Bosworth, and Frank Grillo constitute a first-class cast for this gritty, hard-boiled, methamphetamine melodrama.",/review/rw3145904/?ref_=tt_urv

3 December 2013,quincytheodore,3," Story so archaic, it wastes the talented cast.
","I suppose it's not surprising that Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay, since the plot is so ancient it might have been etches as hieroglyph on Rambo's machine gun. There's an appeal to simple action movie, but it's nowhere to be found on the uninspiring Homefront, and even the capable cast can't save it from mediocrity. Either it's from the poor casting or lackluster predictable content, audience will most likely have little to none enjoyment watching Jason Statham bludgeoning random thugs, again.",/review/rw3145904/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2014,jpmyers15-104-234102,7," Jason Statham Delivers Another Ass Kicking
","Okay so I think it's been well established by other reviewers that this isn't exactly an Academy Award nominee. Most of Jason Stathams movies aren't expected to break records, they're just meant to entertain. Once again, I was not disappointed by the amount of ass kicking that took place in this movie. I love seeing Jason Statham do what he does best. Not only did he easily dispatch scum bags in one-on-one confrontations, but he took out groups of guys with ease. Don't expect very good dialog or story lines; just enjoy the action. I personally enjoyed the first fight when he beats up the guy everyone knows as the town wussy. James Franco was actually pretty good as the nasty, horrible villain. I was looking forward to Jason Statham actually dealing with the leader of that biker gang.",/review/rw3145904/?ref_=tt_urv
