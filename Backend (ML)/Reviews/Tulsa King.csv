","As I see it, everyone is comparing it too much with the original series. It has not much to do with it, except for the setting and some of the original characters (that I believe were put in just to grab attention). Personally, I see it as a whole new project and I don't care much about the old one. ",/review/rw5713743/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2009,Necrom8,6," would have been good If not for the bad writers
","The only reason why I gave It a 7 is because It has potential. I liked the beginning. When I first sow It at first I though that It's going to be a good series. The main problem with It is the writers. In stead of just making a good series the writers felt the urge to give the character some really weird personalities. either the are too dumb, too emotional, angry or the are just freaks. It's like the writers literally said ,,hey the story is too simple, so we should create our own awful one''. It really is sad to think If they just made a series about normal teenagers, instead of emotionally troubled ones, It would have been a pretty decent series. Hope It improves soon. Also why did they cast actors which, the ones playing the parents look 30 years, and the ones playing their kids look 20 years old?",/review/rw5713743/?ref_=tt_urv

3 September 2008,resonator,3," This is actually pretty ... err... terrible!
","I very rarely have the urge to go to the web and state my opinion about a show, whether I like or dislike it. But judging from the first two episodes I hated this OC-ized version of a 90ties classic so much that for once I did feel the urge. What can I say, in my opinion this show seriously sucks (or bites, or blows, if you've seen the first 20 seconds).",/review/rw5713743/?ref_=tt_urv

20 April 2020,jwkc2,2," Terrible writing
","The plots are nonsense - so much of it is dependent on cheap mechanics. The way relationships are handled is like a child playing with a bunch of dolls ""Now you two kiss, now you two kiss"". The plots, 'characterization' and dialogue are so mind-blowing stupid, it makes you want to throw something at the screen. Season 4 is a zenith in bad writing. Much of the narrative is morally bankrupt and characters despicable (as opposed to flawed, the Jen character excluded). The writers should all hang their heads in shame.",/review/rw5713743/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2008,cjw322,," terrible...truly terrible....
","I gave this show a chance, I really did, but none of these actors or actresses can act. Even in the most tear-inspiring situations, I feel embarrassed for these people because they are unable to even convince themselves or even the poor audience for that matter that what they are doing is worthwhile. I liked Brenda in the original series because she could accurately portray teen angst; Anna on the other hand acts like a cheerleader even in the most dire situations. The show just keeps getting progressively worse. In the third episode, the scene between Kelly, her mother and Erin (Silver) where Kelly confronts her mother for being an alcoholic seemed entirely contrived because there was just no emotion, no depth. I would recommend that no one watch this show. I'm just going to hope that it gets ignored long enough that it is taken off the air without a fuss and then we can all forget it ever aired to begin with.",/review/rw5713743/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2012,steve-61-293483,1," Awful, dreadful, stupid trash.
","I seriously urge anyone who grew up in the 1990's to not watch this. In fact, avoid it like it's the plague. Remember when we were kids and used to watch Dylan McKay and Brandon Walsh duke it out on the original? Yeah this is not that. At all. Don't even waste your time.",/review/rw5713743/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2021,Larsii90,7," Is it bad? Absolutely. Is it also enjoyable? 100%
","I have a deep love for this show. I remember it aired at the same time as Gossip Girl, which was huge in comparison. Granted, it was a better show, but something about 90210 made me love it more.",/review/rw5713743/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2008,lilgra1,7," Not as good as the original 90210, but still has potential.
","After watching the first couple episodes of the ""next generation"", the show is not that bad. It was very smart of them to bring back some of the original cast like Kelly and Brenda. I think that they really bring back a nostalgia feel to their old audience and their acting compared to the new cast is way better. The main Wilson family is suppose to be i guess similar to the Walsh family. For the most part, the new cast is pretty good, except that Annie's facial expressions tend to be too exaggerated and almost seems annoying to me now. For the first episodes it was alright since she's suppose to be from Kansas, but she should definitely tone down on trying to act ""cute"". I like Ethan and Silver and Dixon, they seem to be pretty cool and acting wise believable. The girl Naomi is pretty bad at acting and doesn't seem like she's in high school. For the most part, this is a more pop-ish, and less serious than the old 90210. They play a lot of familiar music in every episode. If you don't take it that seriously, you might like it. I'll give it a couple more episodes and see where they take it.",/review/rw5713743/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2009,Naenae72,1," What's the point?
","What's the point of calling this a spin off series when it has little to do with the original series. This show feels like a rushed version of every other teen drama ever produced. Someone seems to be breaking up and hooking up with a new character every episode. There is nothing new, interesting, or original about this show. There are so many unanswered questions and the new generation is bland, boring, and irrelevant. At least with the original you got a sense of who the characters were.",/review/rw5713743/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2009,oanatimosca,1," ""where every story is intriguing""really?REALLY???
","why are people allowed to produce these kind of shows? The acting is bad. And no, it's not because they have nothing to work with, it's because they are bad actors. Age is not an excuse!If you can't act just stay home!Especially the ""leading"" lady, annie... The plot is awful. Just because they come from Kansas it doesn't mean they are supposed to be stupid or incredibly naive. What? They don't have cable or internet in Kansas? Are they still hunting for food, too? The characters. I don't even know where to start. Drug-abuse, pregnancy, indifferent mother, boyfriend dumping you...why isn't that girl trying to kill herself? Or better yet why isn't SHE the leading lady? Only one of those 3 should be enough to ruin one show so i don't even know why this one is still running. And even if i could ignore all those things, i can't ignore the fact that it's such a bad example for teenagers everywhere. Girls should eat more than salad, and they should not look like they just got out of Auschwitz. And why does every show concentrate on the popular kids in school when they represent only like 1% of student body? i'm not from the states and in high school we didn't have popular kids.and our lives didn't revolve around school.and it was great! I wasn't a fan of the original show (actually i wasn't allowed to watch it because my parents thought it would give a bad example) and i only saw a few episodes now and then,but comparing the two it's like comparing Sophie's Choice to American Pie.

26 October 2009,degrassijesus,10," 90210 is amazing
","I am so sick and tired of people saying they do not like the show because is nothing like the old one... well duh that's the point of the show, and that's why I like it. I can relate more to this show, the status of what teenagers are doing is more effective, and the drama is more relatable than the other one. This is by far my favorite show on television. I like how they mix in the new characters with the old, and the old kind of stepped out of their old character and have been modified into someone relatable for adults. The drama's are exciting, and the story lines are amazing. I absolutely without a doubt love this show and if people don't like it well obviously you guys care enough to trash it, but please don't ruin it for those of us who love it :D",/review/rw5713743/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2009,boidiva02,4," nothing worth seeing
","This show is not so bad that it's unwatchable. But the issue is this. It's billed as a remake of ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" and yet it doesn't contain any of the elements that made 90210 a smash to begin with. Gone is the sly sense of humor the first show had, gone is the group of actors that fans came to love, gone are the characters that America related to. Gone are all the cheesy, yet addictive elements that made the show worth watching. Instead we have some half-baked soap opera without any of the fun qualities that made people watch the first series.",/review/rw5713743/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2011,rj-hilliard7,10," It gets good, trust me
","The first season of 90210 was bad, until the season finale. During season 2, the show improved MASSIVELY. The plots got better and more entwined and the season finale left many shocked. Season 3, though, was weird. The season wasn't bad, but it wasn't as dramatic as season 2. But luckily, it was renewed. The producers and creators must have known this, because season 4 is AMAZING. It's very impressive, well produced. I just wish people would update their reviews, because most of them are coming from season 1. Also, the music on the show is really good. Unlike the other 90210, the drama isn't cheesy and overdone, it's creative and easy to relate to. The show has rich and struggling people, and although some of the themes are odd, but most of them make sense. The only real trouble if you haven't watched is catching up, because in order to watch the current season, you have to at least watch season 3.",/review/rw5713743/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2008,pamalj,1," Really very very very awful!!!!!!
","Tons of teen movie & drama has been produced in the last 20 years, some of them produced good results and others not. 90210 belongs to the second category. I didn't have high expectations on this drama, first of all because it lacks of originality and almost all the remakes and spin-off doesn't succeed to get the same quality of the original (why people can't have original ideas even if they are payed to do it?!). When I see it I thought ""what is it?!...a collage between BH90210, the OC and the last TDramas that have been produced in the last years? And the actors... are they really acting? Am I the only one who looks at them and see that they are stiffer than a dummy, than a mannequin"" My Advice? If u want to see a good telefilm 4 teen and enjoy yourself for an evening watch One tree hill, the OC, Dawson's creek, Buffy or if u're nostalgic watch again the original Beverly Hills but pleeeease don't look at this lame show.",/review/rw5713743/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2008,adamesq,7," Better than Expected!
","I went in as a big fan of the original, expecting to be disappointed. I actually like this show! I don't think I'd feel the same without Jennie Garth. I'm hoping that the original characters don't appear just for the purpose of launching this show. That would detract from the authenticity of the project and diminish the lure in to watching the show. The only weird return from a Spelling predecessor is Rob Estes - only because I feel like Lisa Rinna or Heather Locklear are about to run onto the set.",/review/rw5713743/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2008,vierstra66,1," SO Disappointed
","I never missed one episode of the old 90210 because it was so cheesy and great and I fell in love with the characters especially Kelly and Dillon. This 90210 sucks! All the characters are lame! No one is intriguing and wants you to watch them every week to see what happens like the old one. The best part about the new season was to see Kelly , Brenda and Nat. It was interesting to hear about what they have been doing. Like Kelly having a 4 year old child. I wonder if it is with Dillon, I hope so. All the old characters should just wait like Sex and the City did and do the original right, a couple years from now. This program will never last. It blows! Bummer!",/review/rw5713743/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2009,princess_paris96,9," fantastic
","after watching the season i would like to congratulate the network in producing a wonderful show. the story lines were good and very realistic and the idea of the show was good. the season finale was amazing. unlike most shows it had a mixture of things going on. and it leaves you wanting more. i admire the shows writers for using a topic that isn't very common on shows these days. silver mental illness was very well written, realistic and she was able to portray the character well. sure some bits of the show are a bit stupid like the stereotypical characters, annoying actors (shenae grimes) but considering some other shows out there, it is definitely better than most. a i am sick of watching shows based just on love. its so annoying. finally a show that has different issues as well. and most of the actors are great. Jessica Stroup and Jessica Lowndes are the two most brilliant actors on this show. ",/review/rw5713743/?ref_=tt_urv
