21 October 2020,owen-watts,7," Prebble & Piper's List of Unsayable Things
","Immediately preceding the first series there was an interview with Lucy Prebble on British radio where she said in the course of writing the series her and Billie Piper wrote a list of things ""they couldn't possibly say"" but eventually ended up using everything. It's not necessarily easy to imagine which of the many brutally sharp observations on display here came from the list but the concept of it popped into my mind every time the show pushed things into deeply uncomfortable waters.",/review/rw6053862/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2020,Quicksand,9," Relentlessly Brilliant
","The low rating and the poor reviews are baffling, especially when this series has been well-reviewed elsewhere. Best guess? It's about a woman and her problems, and our society (US and UK alike) is just misogynistic enough to write that off due to lack of education about what women experience just by virtue of living in the world-- the very education this show seeks to provide.",/review/rw6053862/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2020,jadeleak,9," Honest portrayal of the flawed human character
","Susie isn't exactly the anti-hero, but she isn't the hero either- no one is. All the main characters have flaws and are complex. I enjoyed the quirkinesses of this series which was unlike anything else I'd ever watch. It's not so much a comedy as a dark drama. Excellent acting throughout.",/review/rw6053862/?ref_=tt_urv

28 August 2020,erincarter256,4," Well... I Hate Suzie
","I tried to like this. I thought the trailer was good and drew me in. But 3 episodes in the characters life is so chaotic, and there is no relief written into the script to give you a break from the chaos. There's needs to be a fine balance to carry that kind of disruption off and this doesn't have it.",/review/rw6053862/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2020,charliehaze63,10," Five EPs in and I'm obsessed
","Loving this new show from billii piper , her frentic acting style during the crisis at the depth of this show is so amazing to watch , I don't smoke but I litterally felt I needed a cigarette after episode 1 cos of the anxiety levels she was showing thru her acting. So good, got three epsiosde left to watch and I hope it gets a second season",/review/rw6053862/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2020,arafreeman-75536,7," Seems a lot of people have gathered a big misunderstanding...
","A lot of the comments giving the show lower scores are saying it was too chaotic and the emotional ride never ""let up"" after the first episode. It would seem that people aren't fully aware of the emotional rollercoaster that grief can play on us, which is exactly what this show is about. Each episode is based off of another stage in the process and to forget this when criticising the show is actually doing the show a disservice. It captures the stages very well and the acting throughout was great. Only thing that was a little pushed may have been the extent to which Daniel's character was so manipulative and belittling, however, the show still accurately portrays how these kinds of people make those around them feel. Billie acts in a way that allows you to see what is going on in her characters head without her actually speaking and this show allowed her to show off this talent. Great watch and interesting conversation starters when questioning characters' values and decisions with others that have watched.",/review/rw6053862/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2020,irnbru-333,5," Quirky drama that seems unsure exactly what it wants to be
","It's an interesting premise but the first episode didn't really establish whether it was a plain drama or a comedy or something between the two. As a pilot it was awfully busy without delivering a decent punchline. Could the story sustain another seven episodes? I'm not convinced it will. Billie Piper had too much to do on her own and the other characters seemed a bit one dimensional. Distracting soundtrack. Overall a bit underwhelming, hope it picks up in the next few episodes.",/review/rw6053862/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2020,amycrabb-21395,9," Stick with it!

30 August 2020,freetherocks,5," Exhausting
","Do you know anyone who is needy, dramatic, and constantly makes poor life choices? Utterly exhausting, aren't they?
This is a series about such a person.",/review/rw6053862/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2020,Tom_Sugden,3," Exhausting
","This series doesn't really know what it wants to be. It's not funny enough to be a comedy; not weighty enough to be a drama; and the quirkiness is so forced. It's exhausting to watch. It's impossible to invest in any of the characters, not because they're unlikeable - although they are; all of them - but because they are not relatable. I feel so tired by the end of a 30-minute episode and relieved that it's over. There is no joy in this series, just a knot in my stomach as I watch Billie Piper lunge dramatically from disaster to disaster. Give it a miss.",/review/rw6053862/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2020,pontram,," Suzie hates Suzie
","This series centers around Billie Piper as Suzie, and it seems there is very much of her own vita in it. Her youth as a Pop Star is just taken 1:1 into the story. Note that Billie Piper was once a really famous singer with several No.1 hits in the UK.
Here we learn what might happen when we read about the life and scandals of some bigger and smaller stars (or better, celebrities), and what impact that has on their lives, from their perspective.
Can that fill 8 episodes ? - Yes, with such a great cast, it can. But, it takes those 8 episodes to work out what is really going wrong. Or not.
It's not easy to follow Suzie's ways of being Suzie. Though the script is very thorough when it comes to describe situations and the inner state of Suzie or her friend Naomi, it misses in being similiar thorough about her husband and providing at least a small background how and why they came together, as different as they are. So, the husband isn't as far a complex character like Suzie, he is just ""a husband"". He doesn't adore her or really love her, I could not find any sign of that. And maybe that is why things happen as they happen here, but I tend to think that this is not the case.
As being said before, the show centers around Suzie, and it centers deliberately on her and indeliberately sometimes too much on itself.
So, 7 stars from me for Bllie herself, the other cast members, and the good production values, which make this all in all a good show, but not a great one.",/review/rw6053862/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2020,the_nephilim71,1," Nope!
",I really DO hate Suzie! She is narcissistic and not a very nice person. The show isn't funny and that's the biggest problem. I love Billie Piper but not enough to watch this crap.,/review/rw6053862/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2020,lineart-12973,," Not a comedy
","It is listed as a comedy, but 15 minutes in and I am bored by this nonsense.",/review/rw6053862/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2021,davidadams-04768,9," Suzie runs the Gamut of Emotions on the Road to Acceptance
","That these kind of things happen most often to women is telling. The show bares the expectations and constraints put on women, whether rich or poor, famous or ordinary, it doesn't matter. Even today, there are still double standards-from without and from within.
But then we see we are all affected by similar expectations, real or imaginary, from others and ourselves. How we react determines our paths and the paths of those in our orbits.
I was gripped by the first episode, watching the incomparable Billie Piper, as Suzie, react as her whole world crashes down about her in an instant as a poor choice is made public. Her expressions are masterful. It made me feel every bad decision I've made in my life.
We've seen these sort of occurrences in the media before. At times we sympathize with the public figure; at other times, we ""hate"" them. To feel something, we have to see ourselves in the character. Well, there is as much to like in Suzie as to dislike. In her unraveling, we are confronted by our own. The darkest moments reveal our mettle, and it's up to you to decide if Suzie has enough of her own to find her way from the darkness.
For me, there were moments when I hated Suzie and moments when I loved her. She could be confounding, baleful, and petty. She could also be assuring, loving, and generous, in essence...human.",/review/rw6053862/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2020,fiona398,7," Great idea, but doesn't quite deliver
","The opening episode of this was great, with fantastic acting and balancing a sense of doom with chaos. The second was good too, but it declined by the middle, seemingly not sure what it was about.",/review/rw6053862/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2020,kellyallen-91096,10," Genuinely Brilliant!
","Watched all episodes in one, so truthful and brave to speak the daily crazy, injustice and misunderstandings that make you want to scream from the inside out. I read one review that said brilliantly off the rails?? I think it's much closer to the truth than anyone one dare admit. Thank you for this, it's perfect",/review/rw6053862/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2020,andrewmoss142,9," Absolute quality....love this show
","Such great writing, the key 3 characters are beautifully structured, actors are on point. You know it's a great show, when myself, a 52 year man and my 18 year old sons can both watch it and adore it. Ignore the bad reviews this is top drawer!",/review/rw6053862/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2020,notar0b0t,6," I... kinda liked Suzie
","Okay, so I watched this series this afternoon and here's my review and opinions of the characters:
I'm torn. On one hand, I disliked Suzie for the better part of the series. On the other hand, in episode 8 she was quite relatable. She has things to say but doesn't know how to tell them, notably to her husband, and she doesn't know who she is and she's just trying to figure it out.
I liked Naomi, and most of the time, liked Cob. The main cast is brilliant; I'd never seen Daniel Ings or Leila Farzad in anything but they were both great.
If this were to get a second season, I'd watch it, but I wouldn't lose any sleep if it didn't.",/review/rw6053862/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2021,zekeblack,8," A challenge to watch, but very worth it.
","Many comparisons made.. but I would go to ""I Will Destroy You"" --
The idea that there's a dramatic, rich inner life going on inside individual Women is a new exploration.",/review/rw6053862/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2020,cotta002-318-865119,8," Modern drama on how a celebrity career can be destroyed by social media
","Really gripping drama about a celebrity singer / actor who has sex photos leaked onto social media,
Each episode is titled as a core feeling and is really compulsive viewing.
It was interesting how I felt about Suzie and her husband to begin with but then as the series progressed how my opinion changed.
Worth a watch. Recommended binge viewing.",/review/rw6053862/?ref_=tt_urv
