11 June 2001,jhclues,10," Thought Provoking Drama From Rob Reiner
","In one of the most telling scenes in this movie, Navy Lieutenant Commander Jo Galloway (Demi Moore), a lawyer who is helping to defend two Marines on trial for murder, is asked why she likes these guys so much.  And she replies, `Because they stand on a wall, and they say Â‘nothing is going to hurt you tonight, not on my watch'.'  Which veritably sums up the sense of duty and honor which underscores the conflict of `A Few Good Men,' directed by Rob Reiner, and starring Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise.  There is a code by which a good Marine must live and die, and it is:  Unit, Corps, God, Country.  But to be valid, that code must also include truth and justice; and if they are not present, can the code stand?  Which is the question asked by director Reiner, who examines the parameters of that code with this film, which centers on the murder of a young Private First Class named William Santiago, who was killed while stationed at the Marine Corps base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  The case draws the attention of Commander Galloway, Special Counsel for Internal Affairs in the Judge Advocate General's Corps in Washington, D.C.  Galloway, taking into consideration the impeccable service records of the two Marines charged with the crime, convinces her superiors that a thorough investigation is warranted in this case, though there are those in high places who would rather see this one plea bargained and put to rest.

16 May 2018,classicsoncall,10," ""You wanna investigate me, roll the dice and take your chances.""
","Once this picture enters the courtroom it becomes riveting. The build up is intriguing as well in it's many aspects of discovering information and the principals feeling each other out regarding temperaments and personalities. I've usually been on the fence about Tom Cruise as an actor, I guess because I equate him with the Daniel Kaffee we're first introduced to, a cocky and brash hot-shot lieutenant who can do no wrong and has a record supporting his arrogance. What's interesting is that I like him as Jack Reacher, but don't care for him much in the early part of this picture, or as Vincent Lauria in ""The Color of Money"". But with the passage of time, I can better appreciate him as an actor now, and revisiting this film has a lot to do with that perception.",/review/rw2529783/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2003,rbverhoef,9," Nicholson is great
","A good film is what A Few Good Men is. It is not perfect but especially the performances take this film to a higher level. Tom Cruise and Demi Moore as the 'good guys' are good, as is Kevin Bacon. But the 'bad guys' make this movie really good. Kiefer Sutherland and most of all Jack Nicholson are masterful.",/review/rw2529783/?ref_=tt_urv

","A young hotshot naval lawyer (Cruise) is given what seems to be an open and shut case of two marines murdering another while he slept. Cruise, who has a reputation for plea bargaining was assigned by division, to defend the accused. Could it be so it never sees the inside of a courtroom? ",/review/rw2529783/?ref_=tt_urv

","To me, the mark of a truly excellent film is in its ability (through both great acting and a solid plot) to make us, the viewers, think just a little bit harder about whatever topic was being discussed in the film. ""A Few Good Men"" is the epitome of that sort of movie.",/review/rw2529783/?ref_=tt_urv

","After what is in this day and age a remarkable run for a drama on Broadway, 497 performances from 1989 to 1991 Aaron Sorkin's A Few Good Men was given the class A treatment in terms of a cast. It was also nominated in several categories for Oscars, including Jack Nicholson as the powerful and malevolent commandant of the U.S. Marines on the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba for Best Actor.

","This is a courtroom drama starring Tom Cruise as Lt. Daniel Kaffee, who is assigned to defend two marines accused of murdering a fellow colleague. Joining the defense team is Lt. Cdr. JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) and Lt. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollack), and all three engage in a rigorous attempt to help clear the marines, who contend that their assault against the colleague was a result of acting under orders.",/review/rw2529783/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2016,Hitchcoc,10," Good, Sophisticated, Courtroom Drama with a Stellar Cast
","This is one of the better courtroom dramas of all time. It starts Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon, Jack Nicholson and others. It involves the killing of a Marine be a couple of his colleagues during what is called a Code Red. That is an abusive act to teach him a lesson about his incompetence. So we go to a court martial and Tom Cruise's character, a lawyer with very little courtroom experience, is asked to defend these guys. Kevin Bacon is the prosecutor. He is assisted by Demi Moore and another lawyer, and they realize early on how far over their heads they are. Soon they are facing evidence of cover ups and manipulations that cloud the issues all the way along. But the principles are diligent. Nicholson plays a hard nosed Colonel who sees the Marines above the law and subject to its own set of laws. Cruise's confrontation with Nicholson is one of the most famous in movie history. This is a truly fine film that has grown on me since I first saw it.",/review/rw2529783/?ref_=tt_urv

","Daniel Kaffkee(Tom Cruise)is a young JAG lawyer who has never been in a courtroom but has won plea bargins for his clients and is the lead defense counsel of two US Marines charged with the murder of an innocent Marine private, ordered by Col Nathan Jessup(Jack Nicholson). Despite not getting lead counsel Jo Galloway(Demi Moore in a wasted role), thinks Daniel needs to take up the case and not plea bargin. Despite a risk of getting court martial, Daniel takes the risk and puts the Colonel on the stand as the Col ordered the hazing of the poor misfit private. Cruise, Nicholson, and Kevin Bacon as the no-nonsense and winning prosecutor Captain Jack Ross give wonderful and commanding performances!",/review/rw2529783/?ref_=tt_urv

","Guantanamo Bay is, apart possibly from the 38th Parallel in Korea, the only place left on earth where the US Military still confronts hostile Stalinism, eyeball to eyeball.  Ceded to the USA after the Spanish-American War of 1898, Guantanamo is America's only outpost on the island of Cuba. Marines guarding the perimeter of the naval base are under immense pressure. Here in the Cold War's last remaining hotspot, they are responsible for protecting the Free World.",/review/rw2529783/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2020,spookyrat1,10," The Second Coming of Maverick!
","Naval Pilot Lt Pete (Maverick) Mitchell from Top Gun is resurrected as another Naval Lieutenant, this time Daniel Kaffee, in Rob Reiner's outstanding military courtroom drama, A Few Good Men.This is not to demean Tom Cruise's performance as Kaffee in any way. If there was ever any doubt about the guy's acting chops, this film should dispel it. There's no doubt the film required a Maverick like legal eagle and really I suppose, who better than the man himself. Cruise plays a talented, arrogant, young Naval JAG lawyer, untested in trial work, who is assigned as the defence counsel, in the court-martial of two U.S. Marines charged with the murder of a fellow Marine. It is initially thought he will do a quick plea bargain deal (which he does specialise in) to facilitate a rapid legal reckoning. But spurred on by co-counsel Jo Galloway (Demi Moore) and the 2 defendants, who want nothing to do with a plea bargain, the lawyers, initially reluctantly, prepare a case to defend their clients.",/review/rw2529783/?ref_=tt_urv

29 May 2018,jjhoops7,," One of my favorites
","This is one of my favorite movies, and one of the best courtroom dramas ever. I can watch it over and over again. It's one of those movies that if I flip the channel and it's on, welp, that's it, I'm going to end up watching the entire thing. (Also in this category: Apollo 13. The constant? Kevin Bacon!) .. A Few Good Men is gripping. It's one of those rare films that is built almost entirely on it's dialogue, and succeeds brilliantly. The script is intelligent and thoroughly engaging. The directing is crisp and suspenseful. The performances are top-notch. Specifically, this is some of Tom Cruise's best work. There are, of course, a few unforgettable quotes, but the build up to these scenes is what makes them unforgettable. As the viewer, you feel like your fighting for justice right along side the cast. Their battle becomes yours, and the movie is all the more powerful for it.",/review/rw2529783/?ref_=tt_urv

","this movie kicks.  it's one of my favorites.  i like courtroom drama, and in my opinion, this is the best courtroom movie ever.  i love the part when tom cruise, during his redirect, asks noah wyle how he knows where the mess hall is if it isn't in the marine guidebooks. is that a great scene or what?  and of course the climax, when cruise has JACK on the stand, is exhilarating to watch, even after repeated viewings.  nichalson may be slightly over the top as colonel jessup, but that's why he's so good in this movie.  kieffer sutherland is perfect as kendrick.  and of course i have to mention jt walsh as markinson, just because i think walsh was a great character actor, and he'll always be one of my favorites.  my score-10.",/review/rw2529783/?ref_=tt_urv

Absorbing and crowd-pleasing adaptation of Aaron Sorkin's hit Broadway play from director Rob Reiner about two Marines charged with the murder of a fellow GI at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba with a tangled web of power and a green defense lawyer (excellently played by Cruise) assigned to follow the motions without a trial.  Superb performances all around especially Nicholson in rare form as a colonel with one hell of a Napoleon complex.
