","Everything Must Go is probably Will Ferrell's first truly well done film in years. The Other Guys was pretty good, Step Brothers was funny in parts, but this one totally takes the cake for being a great drama, and schools anyone who thinks Will Ferrell can't do anything but comedy. Though I doubt fans of Old School will think highly of this.",/review/rw2608063/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2011,cosmo_tiger,," A different role for Will Ferrell. A very good performance in a very good movie. Well worth watching. I say A
","""Good without the bad ain't no good at all."" After Nick (Ferrell) gets fired from his job of 16 years he comes home to find his wife has changed the locks on his doors and all of his stuff is on the lawn. Thinking the best way to fix things is to stay at home Nick begins his new life, living outside. This is a very very good movie and a very different role for Will Ferrell. While not quite as good as Adam Sandler in ""Reign Over Me"", Ferrell still shows he has what it takes to be a good dramatic actor. There are a few funny parts in this but this is not a comedy. It's a drama with a lot of heart and while the movie is depressing at times it is a joy to watch. Ferrell does have some funny scenes with his own style of humor that adds to the character and watching him with the actor that plays Kenny is a treat. This is not a typical Will Ferrell movie, but being a huge fan I loved it and look forward to more roles like this from him. I highly recommend this. Overall, if you like Ferrell you will like this, if you don't give this a shot still. You may like the change. I give it an A.",/review/rw2608063/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2015,m1965,," Will Ferrell Deserves an Oscar
","OK, maybe not an Oscar, but definitely some kind of recognition for the performance he gave in this movie. I'll be honest, when I chose this off my streaming service, I was a little hesitant. After all, Ferrell is known for his raucous humor (which I enjoy), but having seen previous reviews for this film - I knew it wasn't ""Anchor Man"" material. I was more than pleasantly surprised. Depth, great acting (by most, if not all of the cast), impeccably well placed music - and a story that most everyone can relate to.",/review/rw2608063/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is not a movie for the masses. Will Ferrell fans who liked Melinda and Melinda and Stranger Than Fiction will not be surprised by his performance as Nick Halsey in this movie.

4 December 2011,Chrysanthepop,," When All That's Left Is You
","Dan Rush's modestly paced 'Everything Must Go' pretty much takes a look at the worst day of Nick Halsey's life and the days that follow where he's left stranded in his lawn. The theme is quite refreshing but even though the movie is tagged a comedy, the humour here is very dry (it does draw a few chuckles) and it felt more like an intense human drama than a comedy. Halsey's situation is depressing and it really makes the viewer want to hate Catherine, even though, the writer tries to make the point that she was justified in treating him that way. But anyway, this is Halsey's story and perhaps to balance the intensity, Rush could have added more quirks. The pacing is quite slow at times but there was never a boring moment. I liked how the director and Ferrell depict Halsey's struggle with alcoholism. However, I felt that the story and characters (especially the supporting ones) could have been further developed. Will Ferrell is excellently restrained which makes Halsey all the more human and easier to relate to. Rebecca Hall is brilliant. Laura Dern has about one scene and she shows the viewer how one scene alone can make an actor stand out. Overall, I wouldn't recommend 'Everything Must Go' to those looking for a comedy. It is an intense humour drama about a man who once had everything and is now forced out of his house and how he struggles and attempts to deal with his problems one step at a time.",/review/rw2608063/?ref_=tt_urv

To those of you who have or have ever had trouble sleeping...you know when your brain just won't shut the hell up & everything is running through your mind a mile a second?

11 December 2021,classicsoncall,7," ""Everything is not yet lost.""
","Strange film. With Will Ferrell in the cast, and a title like ""Everything Must Go"", you would expect some sort of comedy given the set up and the situation his character Nick Halsey finds himself in. Instead it becomes sort of an introspective look at the reason for Halsey's alcoholism and job loss, punctuated by occasional lapses into his past life which at one time seemed to hold promise. The one big question mark I had in the story was when he showed up on the doorstep of a former high school classmate (Laura Dern), after finding out where she lived by contacting her mother back in their old home town. But then, didn't it seem like she lived just around the corner? How would he not have known that? I thought it a major distraction.",/review/rw2608063/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2019,ratpackaustin,9," Criminally undervalued and misinterpreted
","Ok to start with the obvious and most common gripe I hear people have with this movie. Yes it is Will Ferrell, no it is not a comedy. Moving on. This movie is a realistic depiction about our inner demons and the consequences our decisions create for ourselves. Usually movies just have all rainbows and lollipops and happy endings for our protagonist. However, ""everything must go"" shows that sometimes life just freaking sucks, and sometimes it's your fault. It's a Grimm reality but one that exists for many people in the real world. It does kind of end on a happier note, but we the audience can't help but feel like Nick has so much more to go through in his life. By far the best parts of this movie are the depiction of addiction, it's beyond real. This movie perfectly shows the reality of addiction. It's a crutch for those who are addicted and Nick is one of those people. When his life goes to hell? Cracks open a beer. When he's bored? Beer time. When he feels the itch? You get the point. But it's the same in reality, whenever you feel something you go to your crutch. And to see him battle against it was moving and great. Overall I loved this movie and personally love when comedians can show their acting chops in dramas. 9/10",/review/rw2608063/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2011,asam3122,9," A Wonderful Example of Ferrell's Acting Ability
","""Everything Must Go"" is a wonderful film. Taken from a short story by Raymond Carver, it is a simple idea, but richly textured so the viewer must look under the layers of simplicity for the story to open up. The short story is only a few pages long and it is very simple on the surface. The writing is sparse, but it still makes you think and this idea goes into the film as well.",/review/rw2608063/?ref_=tt_urv

1 June 2011,george.schmidt,8," Ferrell acquits himself in this fine dramedy
","EVERYTHING MUST GO (2011) *** Will Ferrell, Rebecca Hall, Michael Pena, Laura Dern, Stephen Root, Christopher Jordan Wallace. Ferrell stars as a downward spiraling drunk who has his worst day yet: after being unceremoniously fired from his corporate job he finds his wife has thrown all his worldly possessions out onto their front lawn and locked him out of their home – forcing him to sober up in more ways than one. Based loosely on Raymond Carver's short story ""Why Don't You Dance?"" newbie filmmaker Dan Rush fleshes out the bare bones storyline by incorporating new characters to interface with Ferrell and the fine cast lends able support to his better-than-expected dramatic turn (shrewdly low-key but humorous as well) that works for what it's worth as a decent dramedy.",/review/rw2608063/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2013,sddavis63,5," Will Ferrell Shows Some Versatility, But The Story Has No Real Point Or Conclusion
","The first thing to know about this movie is that it's not your typical Will Ferrell comedy. It's not outrageously funny; it's not ridiculously silly. Truthfully, in spite of the comedy/drama label, it's not really a comedy at all. This probably just could have been called a drama. This is downcast, sombre and even sad almost from the first moment. It makes the point that Ferrell can offer an effective performance without having to be outrageous (much as ""Reign On Me"" made that point for Adam Sandler.) And he was effective in this.",/review/rw2608063/?ref_=tt_urv

","Released in 2010 ... remember that financial crisis? You know, the one that was only partially self-inflicted?
Anyone who saw this movie in 2010 could probably relate. Either personally or by extension.
It's a brutal and honest and entertaining movie.
""You haven't hit rock bottom if you can say you've hit rock bottom""
That sums up this movie. We all suffer greatly in this lifetime. And it has little to do with the intolerance of others. It has to do with us and our inability to learn the simple lessons that childhood provides.
Number 1 lesson? Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.",/review/rw2608063/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2019,ptomley47,8," Will Ferrell and Christoper J Wallace are awesome
","Will Ferrell is amazing one minute he can play the clown the next he can play a role like with drama and pathos. The relationship between Will Ferrell and Christopher J Wallace is so touching and special. I hope Christopher J Wallace furthers his successful career being so young and showing so much talent. To me this relationship was more special than Will Ferrell with his female co-star(can't break this link)

","Greetings again from the darkness. Seeing this film back-to-back with Mel Gibson's ""The Beaver"" was a mistake. Following up manic depression with severe alcoholism and mild depression is just a bit too much weight in such a short time. But I guess that's the point of this one. Will Ferrell stars as Nick who loses his job, punctures his boss' tire, and finds out his wife not only left him, but also locked him out of the house with all his belongings in the front yard. That's in the first 8 minutes of the film.",/review/rw2608063/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2011,scotty_cable,7," Everything Must Go is a well-made movie, but heavier than I was seeking
","I really enjoyed Stranger than Fiction and, since I had heard Will Ferrell's performance in that movie compared favorably to the one in Everything Must Go, was excited to see EMG. I walked away after seeing EMG a little unsure of whether I truly enjoyed the movie or just merely appreciated the quality of the director's vision and execution. Everything Must Go is the story of Nick Halsey (Ferrell), a struggling alcoholic who, in the first 10 minutes of the movie, has been laid of from his job and kicked out of his house by his wife, all within the same day. The rest of the movie looks at Halsey's attempt to manage the tension between wanting what he once had and trying to pursue a life that he desires, even though he isn't entirely sure of what that looks like. I will start by saying I thought the acting of everyone involved, especially Will Ferrell and Christopher Jordan Wallace, was superb and a highlight of the movie. I thought the music and visuals added significantly to the feel of the movie, especially how so much of the movie occurred in the front yard with the records of his father occasionally playing in the background. Now I knew to expect a story that was not a happy-go-lucky comedy (is there one about an alcoholic struggling with sobriety), but was hoping for some more lightheartedness. I did particularly enjoy watching the relationship between Nick Halsey and Wallace's ""Kenny Loftus"", and thought that the filmmakers did a good job pairing the two actors up. A couple of things with which I walked away: first, I found it interesting how the director decided to show Halsey's eventual growth in the way that he let go of certain things, and to whom he left them. Afterwards, a friend of mine and I discussed how difficult these acts would have been, but thought it appropriate for someone trying to move beyond such a serious issue as alcoholism. I also found it interesting that such a pivotal character, like Halsey's wife, has no screen time at all, save for her voice in one scene. It is as if the filmmakers want us to see how much damage one person has managed to do by simply stepping out of another's life. Overall, I do believe that the movie was well made, with an interesting story and fantastic acting, but the mood of the film was a little heavier than what I was looking for.",/review/rw2608063/?ref_=tt_urv

1 March 2013,nesfilmreviews,7," Two terrific performances carry this everyman story.
","It's a touching, and beautiful character study on real people, with real problems. You can go anywhere - and you'll find someone who's faced an alcoholic - and the effects it has on their personality, their relationships, and ultimately their life. Now, ask three people about divorce - statistics show that over 50% of couples end in separation. Since you've covered two dramatic issues, go take a look at the unemployment rate - or even worse, about the people who've been laid off from their job because of the recession. Finally, imagine facing all three devastating predicaments, in one day. ""Everything Must Go"", is loosely adapted from the Raymond Carver story ""Why Don't You Dance?""--a portrait of a man in collapse. ",/review/rw2608063/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2011,Rockwell_Cronenberg,1," Absolutely absurd from the word go.
","I think that Will Ferrell is one of those actors that can do a pretty solid job of mixing comedy with drama, and I like when he plays human characters. Unfortunately here he is stuck in a movie that pretends to be this grounded character drama about a broken man who's lost everything, while it's actually just an absurd story that doesn't fit into any real context and meanders along until it thankfully comes to it's disastrous end. The film has a setup that I just couldn't get into at all. Based on a short story by Raymond Carver, Ferrell's Nick Halsey gets fired in the opening scene and then goes home to find out that his wife put all of his things on the lawn and changed the locks on the door. Halsey constantly makes a point of mentioning that he owns the house, so why doesn't he just call the police and have them let him in? Seems pretty simple. Even more simple given that his wife just isn't there anymore; why would she bother changing the locks and throwing his things on the lawn if she was just leaving? So right off the bat I wasn't on good terms with this one.",/review/rw2608063/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2012,scottj662,10," Excellent Movie
","I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and Will Ferrell's persona and it was a 180 from his usual comedy's. This movie is a completely different take on his skills and performances and I am very, very impressed. The ambiance of this movie kind of reminds me of Bill Murray in the movie, ""Lost In Translation"" and Adam Sandler's movie, ""Reign Over Me"". All three actor's did a good job at something different and I like it when actor's do this and especially when it works well. The director's in all these movies are very good and is in my opinion half of the success of any movie. One of my favorite director's these days is Sofia Coppola who I think does a great job at instilling a deep sense of real-life into her movies. She deserves more recognition in her directing and this is not because of her last name, but her true skills in directing. Director Dan Rush did an excellent job with Ferrell's movie also.",/review/rw2608063/?ref_=tt_urv
