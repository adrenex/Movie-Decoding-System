16 December 2022,Tweetienator,6," Visuals Top, Movie Not
","The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",/review/rw8754369/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2022,JumpingCineFile,7," Visually stunning and action packed but story is light
",This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.,/review/rw8754369/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2022,Paragon240,6," Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story.
","It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",/review/rw8754369/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2022,garabedian123,4," I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one
","So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?",/review/rw8754369/?ref_=tt_urv

14 December 2022,Jeremy_Urquhart,9," James Cameron's triumphant return
","It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.",/review/rw8754369/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2022,fraser-simons,6," Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is
","Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.",/review/rw8754369/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2022,EvanoOruvan,6," Most part felt like watching a sequence from National Geographic
","Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..",/review/rw8754369/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2022,imseeg,4," Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!
","Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!",/review/rw8754369/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2022,Dory_Darko,9," Damn James Cameron...
","He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:",/review/rw8754369/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2022,namob-43673,7," A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche
","If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.",/review/rw8754369/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2022,Sam56800,5," Visually stunning but very weak characters and story
","I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.",/review/rw8754369/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2022,jon_hsieh,3," During Cameron's VFX gloating...he forgot to throw in a story..
",The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looks like an PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.,/review/rw8754369/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2023,adrenilinmatt-56062,10," I Don't care. I just don't. This was beautiful, and an absolute experience in 3D imax.
","Okay. I'm just gunna write from my heart here on this one, mainly because that's what was impacted most by this ""movie"". We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.",/review/rw8754369/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2022,louis1011,9," One of the most visually innovative films ever
",This film is visually stunning. It simply has to be seen on the biggest screen possible in 3d. That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.,/review/rw8754369/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2022,Harkonnen2,9," A movie worth going to see at the cinema
","The movie while not fantastic storywise was very enjoyable and well worth going to see it. The visuals where beyond fantastic and makes this years other blockbuster CGI look like a joke. Would recommended strongly seeing it in 3D, while its mostly a novelty that because in most cases its done cheaply as a gimmic. Not in this case .The biggest suprise was how they returned some of the characters from the 1st movie which just fit right in.",/review/rw8754369/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2023,the-n,3," Story and especially the dialogue is awful.
","There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",/review/rw8754369/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2022,oogway22-428-714530,4," How does a script get ignored for 13 years?
","One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!",/review/rw8754369/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2022,shawcarvetht,3," Tiresome

14 December 2022,OJT,5," Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun

16 December 2022,AdrenalinDragon,6," More Avatar, More Water, More Average
","James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.",/review/rw8754369/?ref_=tt_urv

16 December 2022,dmerette,6," Not worth waiting 13 yrs for
","I liked it, but it wasnt worth waiting 13 years to see. I dont get how it took 13 years for this to be made. I felt like I was watching Titanic again near the end. It was beautiful, but lacked any real story or anything new. I guess I was expecting so much more waiting so long and having to sit in the theater for so long too. I did cry a little, so I gave it 6 stars, but Finding Nemo was more interesting. The story was weak and cookie cutter I've seen that before kinda thing. Why couldnt we have more animal fighting? I loved that in the first one. I just feel so empty and wish I could have some kind of warm fuzzy feeling and glad I watched it, but I dont think it was worth the wait. I guess I'll be dead before the 3rd Avatar comes out at this rate.",/review/rw8754369/?ref_=tt_urv
