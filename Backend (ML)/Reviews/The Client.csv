31 December 2022,simmsmaggy,8," Gripping tale with clever twists
","This was an excellent Twixtmas binge-watch. ITV seems to have created a distinct genre of regionally filmed and located drama, and this one does not disappoint. The action slowly reveals the circumstances that led to a girl's death and then equally carefully strips away piece by piece all the certainties surrounding it. Cleverly, none of the characters from the grieving parents, to an exploited teenager appear particularly likeable, nor are they written to elicit the audience's sympathy. The drama also explores the grim reality of life in areas that are run by drug gangs and the pervasive grip of fear that such gangs can exert.",/review/rw8786722/?ref_=tt_urv

",Gotta say that was fantastic and gripping from the start to finish. I won't put spoilers as I hate that happening. But it's definitely worth a watch. I was only watching one episode ended up till 2am watched all four of them. The actors and acting was exceptional as always with some of the people in it. I honestly don't think Vicky McClure as ever been in anything bad. She becomes the person she is playing so well and she is just one of the best actresses ever. A few actors from this us England is always good to see. Looking for my next series now for my my next Saturday off work. Watch it guys you will not regret it.,/review/rw8786722/?ref_=tt_urv

","The earthy allure of Vicky McClure is always a welcome attraction to any show and kept me watching through what felt like a run-of-the-mill ITV drama viewers have come accustomed to in the past decade or so but, fear not, there is a lot more to this story with a great twist in the tail to the whodunit in thd final episode.",/review/rw8786722/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2022,irnbru-333,8," Cleverly worked and very dark thriller that will keep you guessing
","A grieving Mother (Vicky McClure) searches for the truth about her daughter's murder years ago. Its an excellent premise and Without Sin, filmed in and around Nottingham feels authentic and delivers on its promises.",/review/rw8786722/?ref_=tt_urv

",It seems that nothing can be commissioned for ITV or BBC that doesn't have a fully completed check-list of PC nonsense.,/review/rw8786722/?ref_=tt_urv
