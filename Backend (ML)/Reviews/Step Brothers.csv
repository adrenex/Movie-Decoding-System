10 July 2016,A_Different_Drummer,7," (heavy sigh) It's OK, but it could have been great
","The core Tarzan story is not only iconic, it speaks to something deep within us. It is at the same time the ultimate Romance and the ultimate Action tale. It is no coincidence that, almost a century ago, when young Hollywood looked to find a franchise for its new ""talkie"" motion pictures, they turned to the Tarzan tale, and spawned a franchise so successful that it literally outlived the shelf life of its star.",/review/rw3506146/?ref_=tt_urv

29 June 2016,somf,8," Flawed but never boring
","I am really surprised at the mediocre reviews so far of this film. Honestly when I first heard about the film I had little interest in seeing it, but the trailer was better than I expected, and when has Christoph Waltz been anything short of terrific in every role he has played, but particularly when he is a bad guy. (Come to think of it has he ever been a good guy?) The whole cast is solid, and I really liked the historical setting concerning the Belgian King Leopold and his exploitation of the Congo.

6 July 2016,NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954,7," The spirit of Tarzan is alive!
","Many people today can argue, that Tarzan is somewhat a forgotten character and property. I believe, that kids today, are not all that familiar with the character Tarzan. So it was a matter of time, that one day we would get a reboot. That kids would get schooled on Tarzan, keep it fresh for the people. I believe that this movie does a good job of keeping the character, & the legend of Tarzan fresh.",/review/rw3506146/?ref_=tt_urv

","How, in this modern day, with such high standards of education and courses on script writing and film making, can a big budget film like this one be so bad? It was only because we watched in it Gold Class, in comfortable seats and with food service, that we didn't walk out.",/review/rw3506146/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2016,TheLittleSongbird,4," Despite mostly very good production values, this 'Tarzan' lacks swing

4 October 2016,paul_haakonsen,5," This movie didn't really deliver much...
","I can't claim to have had any particular interest in ""The Legend of Tarzan"" and actually only watched it because my wife wanted to. And having seen the old black and white Tarzan movies starring Johnny Weissmuller, then I had essentially seen enough of Tarzan to last me a lifetime.",/review/rw3506146/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2016,griffolyon12,8," A Well Done Adaptation
","More and more lately I am discovering a disconnect between myself and the vast majority of movie critics. I have loved a lot of movies this year that they've hated, and that trend continues here with The Legend of Tarzan. As far as live-action interpretations of Tarzan go, this and Greystoke are the two champs, with The Legend of Tarzan edging out Greystoke by a teeny bit.",/review/rw3506146/?ref_=tt_urv

","The story of Tarzan is so ingrained into the brains of moviegoers that it's difficult to really put a new stamp or add something fresh to something so well-known. While Legend of Tarzan certainly attempts to take a new approach structurally, it never swings off the screen as gracefully as I had hoped.",/review/rw3506146/?ref_=tt_urv

","Well, he we have another film that looked vaguely interesting on the trailers but turned out to be really boring. Well, there must have been quite a few people wanting to see it though because there were a number of sessions at my local cinema that had sold out, and I ended up purchasing the ticket the night before so I didn't have to waste my time walking all the way to the cinema only to discover that it had sold out again. Well, I didn't waste my time in that regard, but I do feel that I did waste my time sitting in that cinema for two hours watching a film that I really couldn't get all that excited about.",/review/rw3506146/?ref_=tt_urv

","Belgian Congo, late-1800s. The Belgian government is hoping to find diamonds in the Congo in order to shore up its shaky national economy. Their plan hits a roadblock when a powerful local tribe rises up against them. However, the chief says he will lead them to the diamonds if they deliver to him one man - Tarzan. Meanwhile, John Clayton, the Fifth Earl of Greystoke, is living in England with his wife, Jane. He was born and raised in the Congo where he was known as...Tarzan.

19 August 2018,Leofwine_draca,3," A bland CGI adventure
","THE LEGEND OF TARZAN is the latest big-screen outing for Edgar Rice Burroughs's famous ape-man, and thankfully not another lame 'origin' tale but rather a film that feels like one of the many sequels that Burroughs wrote. Sadly, my hopes for this film's success evaporated when I saw that David Yates, the ultra-generic director of the worst HARRY POTTER films, was at the helm. Unsurprsingly this turns out to be yet another bland CGI adventure movie, aimed at kids and without a single bone of wit or originality in its head. Alexander Skarsgard plays the usual strongman, glowering without any charisma, while solid character actors like Samuel L. Jackson and Christoph Waltz are wasted in cliched roles (comedy sidekick and villain, respectively). The less said about Margot Robbie's zero-emotion Jane the better. The film seems to have been written by idiots with no idea of Victorian or Edwardian dialogue (at one point Jane exclaims ""oh my God!"" like a Californian high schooler) but the worst thing by far are the cartoonish CGI animals. The gorillas are a distraction, the ostriches are lamentable, the endless CGI action scenes laughable (even swinging vine Tarzan is CGI). What a pity; give me a good old-fashioned Weissmuller or Scott movie any day over this trash.",/review/rw3506146/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2016,Rendanlovell,4," An underwhelming turn for David Yates.
","What we have here is yet another Tarzan adaptation. This isn't the Tarzan you know from the Disney movie. No, this time we see him start out in England as a gentleman, celebrity of sorts. People all know who he his and his origin. For a moment I thought the film would be smart enough to know that we, as an audience, also know this origin story. But this ain't that kinda movie. Outside of being a ""new"" take on the mythical man raised by apes there isn't anything remotely new about this movie. It still tells us his origin in laziest way possible and it still follows a three act structure that we have seen a couple thousand times over.",/review/rw3506146/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2016,sellers-michael,10," Legend of Tarzan -- Pulp Poetry With a Beating Heart
","There's a moment in David Yates' excellent and emotionally resonant Legend of Tarzan when George Washington Williams', played by Samuel L. Jackson, goads civilized Tarzan, played by Alexander Skarsgard, just a little too much. Alexander Skarsgard's Tarzan erupts instantly and spectacularly with a combination of physical force and gut-chilling animal sounds and pins the American to a wall, then growls out the words: ""They have my wife, and their families."" In this single small moment, Yates and Skarsgard put on display Tarzan's utter commitment to the woman he loves while at the same time same evoking the internal contradiction of a man who in adulthood could pass among society as a aristocratic Englishman, but whose feral upbringing has left him with a volatile beast within that can overwhelm the civilized trappings in an instant. Unlike the filmmakers who have come before him, Yates effectively captures this duality – and in so doing delivers a film that is fresh and appealing to modern sensibilities, yet is faithful to the character of the books in ways that Hollywood has never attempted before. The result is pure pulp poetry with a beating heart. Edgar Rice Burroughs would approve of it, and 21st century audiences will, if they can be lured into theaters to see it, be intrigued and satisfied by it.",/review/rw3506146/?ref_=tt_urv

8 July 2016,stanleyprunty,3," Waste of time and money
","This movie started off quite well, for a movie I had quite mediocre expectations it caught my interest when it introduces some interesting characters with mixed motives, unfortunately that and a few good cinematic shots is where the praise ends for this movie.",/review/rw3506146/?ref_=tt_urv

30 June 2016,Sandy0095,9," Beautiful visuals & CGI bring legend to life
","I wasn't sure what to expect with Tarzan. I thought it might be cheesy or the special effects would look ridiculous, but surprisingly a majority of the time, it looked really good! Do you have to suspend disbelief sometimes? Absolutely. But it's a story about a man who controls jungle animals and swings from vines, so its going to look unbelievable at points. However, I found a good chunk (about 85% IMO) relied on realistic scenery, makeup and special effects. I mean... they're not going to use real gorillas or lions with the actors, but the CGI ones looked really good and will have you mesmerized by the detail. Personally found the movie very enjoyable, action packed and beautiful to watch. The director and actors did a phenomenal job. I found myself glued to the screen for a majority of the film.",/review/rw3506146/?ref_=tt_urv
