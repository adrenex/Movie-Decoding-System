","A few weeks ago I went to see an independent horror film that was honestly one of the scariest viewing experiences I have ever been apart of. That film is the monster hit Paranormal Activity. Now we have yet another unique viewing experience, this one is The Fourth Kind.",/review/rw2404017/?ref_=tt_urv

",I really delayed seeing this movie because of all the crappy reviews I read on here and in other places. How it was all a hoax and that the filmmakers must think we're idiots and it ruined the whole premise and blah blah blah.,/review/rw2404017/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2010,paul_haakonsen,6," Interesting and thrilling
","This is a rather interesting movie, and it deals with a phenomena that we all are more or less familiar with - alien abductions. Now whether or not you believe in this is entirely up to you, but give this movie a chance, if nothing else then for its entertainment value.",/review/rw2404017/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2019,jdwpgh,7," The Blair Witch, but for aliens.
","I don't necessarily know if this movie should be dragged as much as it is, because it's not trash. The premise is kinda campy once you realize that it's not actually real and it is somewhat problematic to piggyback on the real-life tragedies of a small town in Alaska. However, taking the movie for what it is, it's not terrible. It's not great, but it's not terrible. It's enough to make you feel weird about owls though.",/review/rw2404017/?ref_=tt_urv

","At the start of the film you are told this is all true, though clearly it isn't. I don't really understand the point of that. It's fair enough to imply it's real but to outright lie about it, that's just a bit desperate.",/review/rw2404017/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2020,Endless_01,6," Different point of view, but still just average.
","The UFO genre is one of my favorite genres to kill time when I'm watching a horror movie, The 4th Kind was a pretty hype movie the time it came out, at least in my city, I remember there was a lot of emotion about the trailer and the cover it presented, and how it was part of the sacred genre ''based on real events''. Oddly enough, I didn't see it on opening day, so I can say that by today's standards, it's a great meeh.",/review/rw2404017/?ref_=tt_urv

16 July 2013,saad_sarwar,7," A different kind
","The genre of this movie attracted me first but the poor IMDb rating ruined my interest to see it. I heard somewhere that it's kinda horror but a different type. After watching this, I can also tell that it's really a different one. The movie based on the story of alien encounters where a psychologist discovered some disturbing evidence of alien abduction ever documented. Once you start seeing this movie, the story will keep your attention throughout the end. But at the end, it's depend on the viewer whether believing the story as true or fake, but this movie can make someone confused over the true existence of the story in practical life. Not bad as the rating shows so.",/review/rw2404017/?ref_=tt_urv

6 November 2009,rivertam26,8," you've never seen this before.
","The Fourth Kind is a creative, highly terrifying film. I'm not sure what I expected going into this film but it was something completely different. But combining supposedly real archive footage(that actually looks real for once), an intro and outro by the films star and director and a dramatization of the events that occurred is ingenious and realistically effective. The films tells the supposedly true story of a psychiatrist in the small town of Nome, Alaska who decides to finish her husband's work after his murder on sleep studies. What she finds is a common disturbance amongst most of the towns people of seeing an owl looking over them while they sleep. As the film progresses along and truly disturbing events take place we discover with them that their may be something more going on. Something to do with alien abduction. A subject that has always left me feeling uneasy especially after seeing Fire in the Sky when I was younger. The film's subject matter is carefully handled in a really creative way so that it feels genuine and all too real. The film is at times an absolute nightmare to watch. Glimpses of terrifying footage both dramatized and real footage shown really make for a one of a kind mind blowing experience. I was actually tearing a little I was so frightened. But the film's far from flawless it does seem to be long in a few spots and the performances are uneven especially from Jovovich although she gives it her job and does alright. The film is beautifully shot and evokes a surreal experience. There is once scenes where we just follow an owl staring at us as it's head spins all the way around. It's truly unsettling and this film is a new experience all together. whether you love or hate it, it's something that has never been done before.",/review/rw2404017/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2010,Westcoastal,2," What a huge disappointment
","This movie was outright terrible. I am amazed at some of the comments and reviews. It's hard to imagine what people see in this piece of garbage. The writing was bad, most of the acting was bad, the story was bad. The choices they made in presenting the material were also unbelievably bad. Showing two actors portraying the same scenes for much of the film was just... I can't even find the words to describe how misguided that was.",/review/rw2404017/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2010,winstonsmith_84,2," Poor
","Alright. First of all, there is no point debating whether the film is a hoax or not. Firstly, the people in the supposedly ""real"" footage are actors... who have been in films. You can find it out on IMDb. The ""real"" Charlotte Milchard is an actress from the UK:",/review/rw2404017/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2009,jaredmobarak,8," Even with hypnosis, it's black  The Fourth Kind
","I don't care if The Fourth Kind utilizes real footage or not, it's a very powerful film. All the marketing materials allude to the fact that filmmaker Olatunde Osunsanmi interviewed psychologist Abigail Tyler and, by using actual footage of her hypnotizing patients and herself, recreated scenes to give the audience the full story of what is happening in Nome, Alaska. The technique is very effective—excising names, showing the actors' names and who they are playing, (mostly changed to withhold identities anyways), showing the ""real"" Tyler in split-screen with Milla Jovovich's representation of her, etc, etc. I will admit to doing as little heavy digging as possible, going into my screening with the absolute belief that it was true. Do yourself a favor and do exactly that if you want to take a gander. It may play like an episode of ""Unsolved Mysteries"" but boy does it pack a punch. You will be doing yourself a disservice by debunking it all first, if in fact it is debunkable, (which I think unfortunately now that it is). Go in blind and be riveted, frightened, and made into a believer.",/review/rw2404017/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2020,Hey_Sweden,6," Milla acts her heart out.
","""The Fourth Kind"" purports to be based on ""fact"", but in truth, none of what you see is ""real"". In actuality, the filmmakers use actors throughout, recreations and the story proper alike. This may disappoint, if not anger, the audience. All in all, the filmmakers here are utilizing a gimmick, complete with deliberately old-fashioned ""recordings"" and split-screen technique. It makes their little film somewhat akin to ""The Blair Witch Project"", a decade after that independent horror flick had its great success.",/review/rw2404017/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2009,Quinoa1984,3," a disappointing movie - wasted potential and shoddy film-making
","I didn't believe for a moment that the ""actual footage"" in The Fourth Kind was actually actual footage. Surely one would have heard of stories of a relatively unknown filmmaker Olatunde Osunsanmi crafting a docu-drama out of footage from actual alien abductee interviews from some years ago. It should be no surprise that it is just a gimmick to make the story of UFO abduction more credible, which is all well and good. Indeed this wasn't even really the problem in and of itself I had with the movie. It was just that, well, it wasn't a good movie. This may sound like one of the weakest ways to complain about something like a film that took a lot of preparation and acting heft (or not or too much as case turns out), but it is the case here. It's a premise and technique that starts promising, and then without knowing exactly when it just crumbles in self-importance.",/review/rw2404017/?ref_=tt_urv

When she uses hypnosis with two clients, they have nervous breakdown and violent attitudes with their discoveries, but they do not disclose what they have recalled. When Abbey finds that she had also seen the owl, she pushes herself to the edge with tragic consequences. ",/review/rw2404017/?ref_=tt_urv

","Why do so many people feel like a movie has to be a life changing event? This movie is a great way to spend 1 1/2 hours. The acting is very good. The ""real"" vs acting element is well done.

11 November 2009,lindsayleaf,10," Terrifying
","I had read the reviews prior to seeing this movie and nothing prepared me for what i saw. It started out slow but built up quick and i was hooked. There is one point in the movie that I almost had to walk out of the theatre it was so disturbing, i'm glad i stayed though...i think! this is the first movie in a long time that kept me up at night not wanting to fall asleep...and I am 25 years old! This movies has a documentary sort of feel to it which makes it all the more horrifying because it feels so real...it is so real.. i don't know! i firmly believe in UFO's but my boyfriend is a HUGE skeptic, after watching this movie he is now a believer as well...or at least more of a believer. It is an extremely convincing and terrifying movie.",/review/rw2404017/?ref_=tt_urv

7 November 2009,catsklgd1,3," Huge Disappointment...
","I had tremendously high hopes for this movie, especially based upon the trailers and viewer reviews. However, the use of gimmicky ""true video footage,"" along with what were represented as ""actual audio recordings"" gave it the feel of a ""Blair Witch Project"" on studio steroids. The use of cheap, theatrical scare tactics, including sudden movements and loud noises, diminished rather than enhanced what little tension the film managed to achieve. But, the worse transgression was the use of an actress (I know I've seen her before, but I can't recall her name) to portray the ""real"" Abbey Tyler in what were supposed to be actual video recordings. So, what you end up with is an actress (Milla Jojovic) acting as the real Abbey Tyler who is then played by another actress. Sorry, but it just doesn't work. Sadly, there are wasted in this production some excellent acting performances by the aforementioned Miss Jojovic, Will Patton (always excellent),and Elias Koteas (Law & Order). I am a sucker for this type of film, but in this case I feel more like I was duped.",/review/rw2404017/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2010,feastorafamine,1," Blair Witch Fake - Dishonest to the point of Criminality
","The reason for the abysmal review is the fact that the film is sold as being ""reality"" based. When i say reality based i mean based on actual events, even events that could be construed as debatable. This is simply not the case here. This is an entirely fictional film for which Universal pictures has paid a settlement for having placed fake news stories in order to sell this film. This is a new low in film marketing. I know the excuse will be that films are in and of themselves a suspension of belief but do we need to be lied to now in order to achieve this? I submit NO! If i were to simply review this film knowing in advance that it was pure fiction i would have watched an entirely different film. A film that was slow to develop and only contained a few moments of actual horror. There were a few fearful moments, a feat easily achieved, but largely this was due to the illusion of reality perpetrated by the introduction of the film by Mila (Lead Female role) as being based on actual events. Sadly this seems to be a trend in the horror genre that i fear may continue simply because of the gap between when the general public can unearth the truth about such films and the money generated in the meantime. Suffice to say anyone reading this review before having seen this film will undoubtedly have a quite different reaction to those yet unaware of the films true fictional nature. I might also add that i am a fan of this genre. I enjoyed the movie Communion with Chris Walken purely for the subject matter despite its flaws as a film. Perhaps those who see this film knowing in advance that it is a marketing ploy will find greater enjoyment. I myself was not amused with the deception. Don't take me for a fool, i don't take at face value and abduction story as pure truth but some basis in reality might have been more acceptable to pure lies. There are of course countless encounters of the fourth kind retold by real people to be debated and discussed. The only thing i feel like discussing about this film is how many people will see it before they know the ridiculous deception perpetrated by Universal pictures.",/review/rw2404017/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2021,lopezpatricia-06139,8," Totally fake just look up the actors or google the thing. Good enough tho
","The second time I've watched this film, this time I had google on my side and it's totally fake the real dr Tyler (woman in interview) is Charlotte Milchard an accomplished actor. It was scary the 1st time cos I really thought it was real. But now it's a bit lame in relation to the patchy translation from the aliens the missing fuzzy footage and the missing words. I still enjoyed it and thought the acting was good and the production too.",/review/rw2404017/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2009,Red_Flag,8," An experience, out of this world
","Stop, before you make a joke about Steven Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" let me make it clear that these films have nothing in common. Instead of Spielberg's focus on making contact with visitors from another word, ""The Fourth Kind"" focuses on the abduction challenging us with the idea of reality Vs. fictional. What's makes the experience worthwhile however is the fact that this film comes with a disclaimer. Warning the following is based on true events. I know what you're thinking; in fact I know your already thinking about skipping this one. Honestly? You shouldn't, because unlike other films based on ""true"" event, this film challenges the reality behind it. The film tackles the issue of whether we should always believe what were told. It's this reason that makes ""The Fourth Kind"" a contact you won't want to miss.",/review/rw2404017/?ref_=tt_urv
