23 November 2022,vandykeu,10," I want more, now
","Wow. I just finished episode 12 of the first season of this show. As a lifelong Star Wars fan, I feel like I'm about 12 years old again. To me, the thing about the Star Wars universe that fascinated me was never the jedi, or the mysticism, or the lightsabers. All that was cool, but to me, the fascination was for the struggle. The underdog vs the world. The fight against oppression. From the original series, Wedge was my favorite character- just a regular guy doing his part.",/review/rw8749548/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2022,charlieedmond,10," This is the Star Wars I want.
","It is clear that who wrote the script for ""Andor"" needs to be promoted to a higher role within Disney's hierarchy of writers because they actually know how to write a coherent story that doesn't trip over itself.",/review/rw8749548/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2022,jaimemedina-36288,9," And, or? Maybe? Yes indeed
","This is, minute for minute, some of the best television on today. Not a ton of FX. Just a compelling story and great acting. It is certainly more adult than other CGI laden spin offs. I don't think any cute cuddly toys will emerge from the series. But the story shines.",/review/rw8749548/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,9," Awesome
","I have to say that I was really looking forward to Andor ever since I first heard about it. Then when I saw the trailers I got even more excited. I just finished watching it and it not only met my expectations but even surpassed them. It actually might be the best Star Wars series so far, or at least right there with The Mandalorian. The entire cast is great but Diego Luna is obviously the real star here. He is just fantastic as the lead. This may start a little slow but stick with it because it picks up in a hurry and the next thing you know you're completely hooked. It's already been renewed for a second season so I can't wait until next season and more of Andor!",/review/rw8749548/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,ComradWinston,9," Diamond In The Rough
","To anyone with the slightest critical eye, pretty much everything outside The Mandalorian and Rogue One has largely been vapid Disney-stamped Star Wars contentâ„¢. Simply keeping-up with the sheer amount of crap being pumped-out is a chore. Compared to the usual sterilized corporate stuff made for their crucial baby demographic, Andor's a breath of natural fresh air.",/review/rw8749548/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2022,Supermanfan-13,9," I've enjoyed it!
","Andor was every bit as good as I was hoping for. It might be the best Star Wars series to date, or at least tied with The Mandalorian. Of all the Star Wars series so far this one is probably the least known character but that doesn't mean it's any less interesting. Andor is a character from one of the best Star Wars movies, Rogue One. All the reviews have been great for Andor so that got my expectations even higher and so far they've all been met. It does start a little slow for some as they build the story but by the end of episode 3 you'll be anxious to see what happens next. It has a real gritty feel to it compared to the other Star Wars series and the visuals are great. It's also more adult oriented compared to the other shows so far. But the cast, led by Diego Luna, is the best thing about this show. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of this show and where it goes.",/review/rw8749548/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2022,poseyfan,10," The sheer grittiness and adult tones are a glad sight in a recently lagging Star Wars universe.

25 October 2022,skintone-38600,10," Brilliant. The best Star Wars for ages

23 November 2022,DocDAT,10," I want to give this more than 10 stars!
","Seriously, this isn't just peak Star Wars. It is peak TV. Mandalorian was good, but this is absolutely outstanding. An absolute gem of intelligent writing and storytelling combined with top notch acting. We just finished episode 12 and I can't stop thinking about how good this is on every level.",/review/rw8749548/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2022,raeldor-96879,9," Adult-Size Star Wars
","Andor is why I pay my Disney+ subscription. This is Star Wars for those who have grown up with the franchise and are yearning for a more mature take on the Universe. It's hard to use the work 'realistic' when it comes to sci-fi, but everything about Andor feels real. The characters act sensibly and their actions never feel like they are purely made to drive the plot forward. I think the last time I used the term 'sci-fi that transcends it's boundary' was when talking about Battlestar Galactica. I think I can safely use that term here too. It's not a action sci-fi, so it's audience it probably smaller, so I hope it will not get cancelled. I hope Disney can find the courage to front a show based on quality and not just audience numbers. I believe that quality shows will always be good revenue earners over time as they are appreciated by more people, even if they are not the most popular out of the box.",/review/rw8749548/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2022,Dimakovtun,8," Best SW series so far (6 episodes S1)
","Seeing all the other series, Andor provides a fresh breath into a franchise that's ultimately does nothing but reuses its own ideas.",/review/rw8749548/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,rannynm,9," Perhaps the best Star Wars spin-off series so far, Andor's superb script, visuals and performances will grip you throughout its duration
","Perhaps the best Star Wars spin-off series so far, Andor's superb script, visuals and performances will grip you throughout its duration. The force is indeed strong with this dark, grounded show, which comfortably departs from the Star Wars formula in significant ways.",/review/rw8749548/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,MamadNobari97,9," HBO's Andor
","The biggest surprise of 2022 in the tv/streaming part of the entertainment industry, and especially surprising because it is after like six or seven disappointed and mediocre to near garbaj Disney+ original shows. And It really does feel like HBO made it and not Disney+.",/review/rw8749548/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,ROOKreations,9," A Welcome New Tone
","First of all, wow! The show immediately grabs you with its first couple of scenes, letting you know that this show is going to have a more adult tone. Seeing the workings of everyday people in the galaxy, the perspective of an imperial loyalist, and a thief making his way through the galaxy is so thrilling and exciting. The big and little details you get out of all the varying cultures on different planets allows you to completely melt into and engross yourself in the Star Wars galaxy, which is what many of us love so much.",/review/rw8749548/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2022,sinahaase-960-743497,10," Just keeps getting better
",This show is surprisingly amazing. It's worth your time and definitely captivating. I started it with low expectations cuz I feel like shows these days seem so cringy and political and force feeding but not this one. And or is quite a breath of fresh film air and the acting....acting is perfect.,/review/rw8749548/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2023,esjacobs,8," Enjoyed it very much, as a NON star wars fan
","Was recommended this show and was hesitant to start. I'm not a star wars fan (gasp) and I have only watched the first movie and season 1 of the mandolorian. Both, with the best intent, I just could not get into. It's just not my thing, but boy how I enjoyed Andor. I find it to be so well done, the story was compelling, liked the characters and they were well build up. It had me clued to the screen, good variety of action and dialogue. The story is well told and good to follow, if you stay focused which is easy with this one. There are many other in depth reviews so I'll just leave with this; if you are not into the star wars universe, try Andor and maybe you'll enjoy this one. In my opinion, the rating is fair in this case and worth a look.",/review/rw8749548/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2023,BirdmanT7,," Compelling and brilliant !
","After Disney acquired Lucasfilm in 2012 and the three sequels they made that were utterly garbage and disastrous, I felt that was the end of Star Wars. I had no interest at all in anything Disney was going to make from George Lucas's brainchild because I felt they just wanted to make action films without any clue as to what the theme of Star Wars was. I saw ""Rouge One"" by chance and I was not impressed, it was like watching a copy of Star Wars, packed with nonstop action with no depth.",/review/rw8749548/?ref_=tt_urv

27 October 2022,melcher-2001,10," Very well done.
","Finally Disney has gone beyond the nostalgic vision at the center of Star Wars films ever since George Lucas first landed on Tatooine. Most of the franchise has been anchored in the sagas involving a single dysfunctional family, the Skywalkers; Luke, Han, Leia, Solo, Anakin, Padme, et. Al., and their wizard friends Obiwan and Yoda. Most of the new and original ideas and interesting characters have been confined to the various animated series and novels.",/review/rw8749548/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2022,tjstarr-99199,8," THE BEST STAR WARS IN YEARS WITH QUALITY STORYTELLING & SUBSTANCE!
","Those hating and complaining that Andor is boring and too slow, are the same people who complained about Sean Bean's outcome in Game of Thrones. Since The Last Jedi, Disney Star Wars has been a consistent dumpster fire of disappointment. The only great content being Rogue One and the last 4 episodes of The Clones Wars. The Sequel Trilogy was a completely avoidable unplanned disaster. Solo, was a unnecessary and pointless cash grab. The Mandalorian is not bad or terrible, but overrated mediocrity, and is now shifting more focus on Baby Yoda than Mando. The Book of Boba Fett was a complete embarrassment. Obi-Wan Kenobi was an absolute insult and is neck-and-neck with The Last Jedi for the worst of the Disney Star Wars bunch. For Disney, their SW content was focused on lots of forced nostalgia, lightsabers, random Cade Bane appearances, a deep fake Luke, Obi-Wan and Vader dueling again for no reason, Baby Yoda, rather than focusing on a really good quality story.",/review/rw8749548/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2022,kindofplace,9," How can a show get consistently better with each episode?
","I'm 11 episodes in, with just one more to go for Season One. My single complaint is the absence of aliens both as background and in speaking roles. This may finally be corrected going forward, at least to some extent, from 11 onward. Alien cultures and the dialogue between ""Basic""-speaking characters and subtitled chatter have been key storytelling features of Star Wars, and without those, the show becomes too human-centric, with only occasional funny-shaped heads used as set dresssing. With that as my single complaint, it's really such a minor issue with this show that finally respects its audience as much as The Empire Strikes Back did over 40 years ago. No hammy comebacks or muppet slapstick; no monotone, confused green screen performances,; no over-reliance on series tropes about destiny or who's-related-to-whom character reveals that made Star Wars not just predictable but tediously fan service in recent years. Lightsabers and Jedi powers are nowhere to be seen (unless we just got a big hint, but that still preserves the mystique and doesn't make the universe overpopulated by force users, for a much-needed change).",/review/rw8749548/?ref_=tt_urv
