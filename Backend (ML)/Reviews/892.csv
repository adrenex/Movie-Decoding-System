18 October 2005,gradyharp,8," Restoration of Dignity to Native Americans, Long Overdue
","James Fenimore Cooper's trusty old nineteenth century novel 'The Last of the Mohicans' has provided a surprisingly sound springboard for a film that tries and succeeds in restoring a profound respect for the Native Americans. Yes, it is a story about the Indians and their culture desecrated by the arrival of European entrepreneurs and colonists all relating to Hawkeye/Nathaniel Poe (Daniel Day-Lewis), who as a child was taken by the Mohawk tribe and raised by wise Chingachgook (Russell Means) with the graceful skills and philosophy of the Native Americans. And it is through his eyes that we are brought into the universe through the eyes of the Indians.",/review/rw1809757/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2008,shhimundercoverdamnit,10," ""The whole world's on fire, isn't it?""
","My all time favorite film. Still gives me chills. It's easily one of the most amazing films I've ever seen and it also features perhaps one of the greatest soundtracks ever. They way, the music hits the scenes is just absolutely astonishing.",/review/rw1809757/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2004,dee.reid,10," Fierce, bold, and beautiful - ""The Last of the Mohicans""
","""The Last of the Mohicans"" was one of the most popular and acclaimed films of 1992. Its vision of early America, as it was during the French and Indian War, is captured in its utter brutality and beauty, complete with the many driving ambitions and clashing cultures of everyone involved.",/review/rw1809757/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2013,planktonrules,9," Exceptional.
","In this 1992 version of ""The Last of the Mohicans"", Day-Lewis plays a long-haired version of the Deerslayer--a white man raised by Mohican tribesmen. He and his adopted father and brother are reluctantly pulled into the battle between the Brits and French during the French-Indian War (also called the Seven Years War). This is because the Brits have no idea what they were doing in the war and so it's up to these three men to save the day...or at least rescue a couple women from certain death.",/review/rw1809757/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2006,ccthemovieman-1,10," One Of The Greatest Adventure Films Ever
","This was one of those movies I didn't expect that much when I first saw it so I was pleasantly surprised. Since then, it has skyrocketed to nearly the top on my list of all-time favorite films. I can't think of too many other adventure films that are better. Just a great, great movie.",/review/rw1809757/?ref_=tt_urv

15 September 2000,tfrizzell,," Impressive, But Overlooked Masterpiece From 1992
","""The Last of the Mohicans"" is a very good film that was basically ignored by everyone in 1992.  Based on James Fenimore Cooper's novel of the same name, the movie is impressive in every way imaginable.  Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe are best in the ensemble cast.  Michael Mann's direction has rarely been better.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",/review/rw1809757/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2000,Dodger-9,," A cut above the other historical epics
","The Last of the Mohicans is by no means your mainstream box office smash. But released in a year of disappointing films, Alien 3, Far and Away, Patriot Games and Lethal Weapon 3 to name but four, it remains one of the most intellectually stimulating flicks of the early nineties.",/review/rw1809757/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2014,Wuchakk,10," Incredible, Magnificent, Reverent, Beautiful, Tear-Inducing
","Director Michael Mann's ""Last of the Mohicans"" is an incredible cinematic experience. I don't often go to the theater and I even rarer see films multiple times (at the theater, that is), but when ""Last of the Mohicans"" was released in 1992 I saw it twice. I then got my hands on the VHS as soon as I could.",/review/rw1809757/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2003,cooldarkraven,10," cheated at the oscars
","This movie won the Oscar for best sound. I have little respect for the Oscars. Best score ever, some of the best photography ever. Day-Lewis gives a powerful performance whose only fault is that he has done better. Copper's sprawling story comes to life with powerful action scenes and emotional close-ups. The final chase is stunning to watch. 10/10",/review/rw1809757/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2003,jckruize,10," Will make you forget that wimpy TV Hawkeye.
","Policier specialist Michael Mann steps way off his usual beaten path with this adaptation of that hoary old James Fenimore Cooper tale of frontiersmen, Indians, Redcoats and the French -- the latter back when they knew how to fight.",/review/rw1809757/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2012,hitchcockthelegend,9," Death and honour are thought to be the same, but today I have learned that sometimes they are not.
","The Last of the Mohicans is directed by Michael Mann who also co- adapts the screenplay with Christopher Crowe from James Fenimore Cooper's novel of the same name. It stars Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe, Russell Means, Eric Schweig, Jodhi May, Steven Waddington and Wes Studi. Music is scored by Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman and cinematography by Dante Spinotti.",/review/rw1809757/?ref_=tt_urv

28 May 2007,ma-cortes,8," Exciting and magnificent movie with overwhelming scenes and impressive scenarios
","The classic James Fenimore Cooper's novel is brought to screen is this suspenseful adventure. We're in 1757, Seven-year-war , between French and English soldiers ; French army supported by Hurons Indians and English army by Mohawk and settlers and tribes allied to each side . The story is partially based on true events , it's a historical fiction. The brave scout ,frontiersman Hawkeye (Daniel Day Lewis) raised by Mohican Indians , and companions ,his fostered father Chingachgook (Russell Means) and his son Uncas (Eric Schweig)rescue a small party that heads for Fort Henry, formed by the lovely Cora (Madeleine Stowe) , and beautiful Alice (Jodhi May) , they're Colonel Munro's(Maurice Reeves) daughters . While Fort Henry is defeated by a French colonel (Patrick Chereau) and the surrendering expedition is attacked by the nasty Magua (Wes Studi) and the Hurons , causing an authentic massacre .The brave Hawkeye saves the intimate sisters and along with the Mohicans and an officer (Steve Waddington) flee , being really pursued by the revenge-minded Magua.",/review/rw1809757/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2000,keihan,," A great American tragedy
","I have not read Cooper's original novel, I will freely admit, nor do I ever really see myself working up the interest to actually do so. But I absolutely love this version of ""Last of the Mohicans"". It was the first movie I ever saw in the widescreen format of video tapes and, after watching it again after about three years of not seeing it, everything I loved about it then still holds true.",/review/rw1809757/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2022,locutas,10," a Timeless Classic!
","30 years on and still a great watch! One of my top 5 movies, every aspect of this movie is graceful film making at its best (minus the buses by the fort lol)
Watch and Enjoy.",/review/rw1809757/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2007,the_yellow_brick_road,10," Beautiful
","I cannot believe I have waited so long to watch this move... granted it was made two years after I was born, but regardless I wish I had seen it long ago! I don't think there are enough adjectives to describe this movie or the effect it has had on me. Incredible. Soul-stirring. Heart-rendering. Amazingly hopeful. Gloriously Sad. It has two of the greatest love stories ever seen on screen- both yearning, smoldering and heart wrenching, and yet so different and subtle- I won't say more. The battle scenes are violent and brutal, but not gratuitously; realism is no issue here- you are transported to another world, and the actors have clearly thrown themselves into it as well. The period is meticulously and perfectly recreated in incredible detail. The scenery is almost as engaging as the action itself; and the score is so perfectly descriptive of the stunning visuals that your spirit actually soars with it. Sorry to be so corny but nothing else justifies it. The final 25 minutes are, in my opinion, the greatest 25 minutes ever filmed. Without spoiling it, let me just forewarn- get the tissues. I have watched this movie 6 times in the past 48 hours. Don't wait, get hooked now!",/review/rw1809757/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2003,pete-246,10," Overlooked masterpiece bucked trends of the time
","It used to baffle me why this film hasn't been held in greater esteem. I was blown away by this film when I first saw it, and knew quite a few people who snuck back to the theater several times for more. The beautiful and harsh scenery, dreamlike photography, sudden explosions of bloody violence, and raging, over-the-top passion amid a collapsing world create a pure emotional rush. This is melodrama at its best, which means that it can really stir your emotions if you let it.",/review/rw1809757/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 1999,Volay,9," Action, Romance, and Intrigue
","The Last of the Mohicans is a timeless tale of the 18th century frontier and the virtue and tragedy that results when the uniquely different cultures of the French, English, Native Americans, and colonists collide.  Based on James Fenimore Cooper's literary genius, The Last of the Mohicans transports the viewer back to a time of America's youth in a brilliant, mesmerizing fashion.",/review/rw1809757/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2000,JuguAbraham,8," Hypnotic musical score and top notch camerawork
","Michael Mann is one of the most noteworthy filmmakers in Hollywood today. As usual (e.g., The Thief, Heat), Mann picks up great music and matches the cinematography to suit the soundtrack. When Daniel Day Lewis and Russell Means run, the camera appears to ""run"" with them in pace with the music. Lewis' acting has been hailed but I thought Means and Studi contributed as much or more as American Indians.",/review/rw1809757/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2003,InfoBabe,10," Totally Absorbing
","This is one of only a very few films that I cannot stop watching once I start.  As others have stated, the music, the scenery totally engage you from the beginning.  The love story was not in the original Cooper story but in this case, certainly improves it.",/review/rw1809757/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2020,K3nzit,6," Overrated in my opinion
","Daniel Day-Lewis and the supporting cast do a fine job in this visually stunning romantic adventure. The production design, action scenes and sound effects were all first-class. Sadly the story was too weak and the slow pace of the film in some places felt not motivated. I liked the powerful score, but it was used too much and became repetitive. Still a decent film by Michael Mann with many memorable scenes.",/review/rw1809757/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2008,JKwiat5787,," Better than the book
","First I saw the movie and got excited by the beautiful backdrop scenery. Then I found out that the two main historical events depicted, the siege and fall of Fort William Henry and the subsequent massacre, actually happened. So I saw the movie again. Then I read the book. Then I read a good book about the French and Indian War.",/review/rw1809757/?ref_=tt_urv
