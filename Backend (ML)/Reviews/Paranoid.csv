3 February 2013,Leofwine_draca,8," Grunts its way to the end with thuggish abandon
","SAFE marks another step up the career ladder for action star Jason Statham, who also made 2012's above-average KILLER ELITE with Clive Owen and Robert De Niro. SAFE steps away from the teen-friendly hijinks of THE TRANSPORTER and DEATH RACE in favour of a more focused and realistic storyline which sees Statham and his young charge (newcomer Catherine Chan, and very good she is too) on the run in New York from not only the Russian and Chinese mafia but the city's police force, too!

23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Not bad. Kept me entertained
","Safe - Quick Review: Safe is a very interesting movie starring Jason Statham who gives a very good performance.Also this movie has good directing with not-so-well shot action but the sound effects are awesome nonetheless.The story while a bit cliche,is still very interesting until the very end.I really enjoyed this movie it's certainly one of the better Statham action flicks overall.",/review/rw2809087/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2012,jon.h.ochiai,8," Safe Works
","Ironically, the most frustrating aspect of ""Safe"" is reading the streaming subtitles for Russian and Chinese. Being that I speak neither I'm straining to absorb the detailed dialogue and narrative threads. Yes, Director and Writer Boaz Yakin's story is far from complex, but you forget that the words really don't matter here. Jason Statham is the badass with a big heart protecting a young Chinese girl prodigy played by Catherine Chan from the Russian mob and the Triad, because she memorized a series of numbers that accesses dire information. Much of ""Safe"" is sheer brute force. Statham's signature strike to the bad guy's trachea punctuates this. Statham's fighting sequences are high impact and resonate with awesome speed and power.",/review/rw2809087/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2012,Pycs,6," Entertaining yet forgettable
","'Safe' is the latest vehicle to showcase Jason Statham's ability to punch, kick, and shoot various henchmen. The plot here plays more of a role than compared to past JS films, as this one involves a young Chinese girl with a brilliant memory who's wanted by both the Russian and Chinese mob, aided by corrupt cops, and it's just to a down-on-his-luck Jason Statham to save the day.",/review/rw2809087/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2012,chrisvales,6," 'Safe' Review - Jason Statham, enough said.
","After watching the trailer when it was first released, I didn't feel what I always feel when I see Jason Statham in an action movie, which is giddy. There was something missing, but how can I say no to Jason Statham in an action packed movie? I just can't. 'Safe' ended up being good. Not great, just good. The beginning was a little slow, but the way they told the story, was a bit of bouncing back between Luke Wright (Jason Statham) and Mei (Caroline Chan), so it didn't really come out running, but I guess I can't complain too much about it because it definitely picked up after. As I stated earlier, how can I say no to Jason Statham in an action movie. The action was amazing. It's that kind of action where the audience is either clapping or yelling, ""Ooooohhhh snap!!!"" followed by some laughing. The storyline was decent, I mean, it didn't really stand out and there are a few scenes where you can probably figure out what's going to happen, but it got the job done. The acting was sub-par once you take out Jason Statham and Catherine Chan (Mei), who I thought did a really good job for her first Hollywood movie. There were a few cheesy lines, some epic quotes, one of which I put in the subject title and I'm sure you'll enjoy it too when you hear it and some funny moments; more than you usually expect from an action movie, which wasn't so bad.

29 April 2012,johnnymacbest,8," Jason Statham at his absolute best.
","This film is the most fun I had at the theaters along with ""Haywire"" and The Hunger Games; films that have thrilled me while at the same time giving me food for thought. Safe doesn't exactly fit the above criteria, but what it does is deliver a well-written action thriller with twists and turns in the plot to get any interested viewer bang for their buck.",/review/rw2809087/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2013,g-bodyl,8," Action-Packed!
","Safe is your typical Jason Statham movie but with steroids. If you have seen any of his newer films, then this movie will not surprise you. But like most of his films, Safe is a nice throwback to the heyday 80's action films. This film simply offers up a good time as we see Statham get involved with the Chinese and the Russians. The stunts are pretty good here as well as the cinematography since we see some cool shots of the action.",/review/rw2809087/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2012,barnabyrudge,5," Entertaining action flick while it's on.... quickly forgotten afterwards.
","Some actors simply aren't versatile and spend their entire careers sticking to what they do best. Can you imagine, for example, Steven Seagal in a stage farce or Hugh Grant in a martial arts flick? They do what they're good at, keeping fans around the world happy but neither of them display that chameleon-like ability to slip from one challenging role to another in the way the likes of Daniel Day-Lewis or Robert De Niro seem so adept. So it is when you walk into a Jason Statham movie. Before the film even begins you know there's going to be fighting and shooting, car chases and slow motion action, baddies being dispatched with cool one-liners, and so on and so forth. It's pointless going in expecting anything else, and just as pointless grumbling as you head for the exit about the plot being too derivative, or the dialogue too cheesy, or that it was all action and nothing else. Safe is a film which is pretty much described by its own title - it is indeed a totally safe action flick, with every character, situation and plot development as familiar as the back of your hand. Director Boaz Yakin makes no effort to disguise the clichés, opting instead to concentrate on noisy spectacle in the Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer tradition. All good and well, if that's the kind of thing that floats your boat.",/review/rw2809087/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2020,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," Jason Statham's film
","Any other lead in this film, would've made this a cheap B-grade flick. Add Jason Statham into the mix, and it's a knock 'em sock 'em kick-butt pistol-whipping Hollywood blockbuster. That is all. Great pacing, length, action scenes and the writing and directing by Boaz Yakin was decent. It's an 8/10 from me, most of it going to Statham.",/review/rw2809087/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2012,Oliver-S-K,7," Fast paced action, wrapped into a decent story.
","Mei (Catherine Chan) is a little genius when it comes to numbers. She can remember everything and calculate anything in her mind. That's why she's very valuable for the Chinese Triads, who use her as a computer that can't be hacked or traced. One day, she's asked to memorize a long number and drive to another place to learn a different one. But the Russian mob steps in and assaults her ride, killing almost everyone. Mei can escape and this is when she meets Luke Wright (Jason Statham). Former elite cop, former small time MMA fighter, on the run from the Russian mob who lost a bunch of money for betting against him in a match and killed his wife in revenge. The will to protect this little girl gives him a new will to live, a drive to go on. And so they run away; away from the Triads, the mob and the corrupt NYPD, trying to figure out why everyone wants either those numbers or her death.",/review/rw2809087/?ref_=tt_urv

5 June 2019,Tweekums,8," Solid Jason Statham action
","This action film sees Jason Statham playing Luke Wright, a former New York police officer who has been reduced to cage fighting in New Jersey... then he fails to throw a fight that was backed by some very dangerous people. They are determined to drive him to suicide; murdering his wife and promising to kill anybody he befriends. On the other side of the world Mei, a young Chinese girl with prodigious mathematical skills, including the ability to memorise long numbers is kidnapped and forced to work for a Triad gang. She is moved to New York and forced to memorise a particularly large number. She doesn't know what it means but is soon becomes apparent that a lot of bad people want it. She is kidnapped by Russian mobsters but manages to escape. Soon afterwards Wright sees her being chased and comes to her help... if he is to save her he will have to confront the Chinese, the Russians and corrupt New York cops.

18 May 2012,michaelRokeefe,8," Memory comes at a price.
","A former highly skilled agent, Luke Wright(Jason Statham), turned cage fighter comes to the rescue of a young Chinese girl, Mei(Catherine Chan), who has been abducted and used for her extraordinary memory. Mei has the ability to take a brief look at an amazing amount of numerals and memorize them. The girl has memorized what is part of a combination to a highly desired safe. Wright comes to her aid taking on the mission of keeping her safe from the Russian mob, corrupt NYC cops and the very same group of gangsters that all but destroyed his life earlier. Strong violence and language and enough gunfire to keep a munitions supplier happy. SAFE earns its R rating with heavy adrenaline driven situations.

8 May 2012,noeldarling3,7," Not as witty as a Statham movie usually is, but just as action packed and just as awesome.
","Cast: OK, I love Statham. Every role he has done, yes even in ""In The Name Of The King"", is almost perfection. Now just because he is awesome , doesn't mean that the movies he is in are, just like ""In The Name Of The King"". Recently though his movies all seem to be the same kind of film and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Lots of action, lots of cheese and some story that involves a rogue badass, aka Statham. I say all that but anyone else in this/those roles and the film wouldn't work. But anyway more on the film in a mo, Statham plays against a little girl played by Catherine Chan, who is awesome, to say she is a child actress. Not much on the rest of the cast, but mentions for James Hong's (known for Kung Fu Panda, Balls Of Glory) mob boss and Robert John Burke's Captain Wolfe.",/review/rw2809087/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2012,movieman_kev,7," Statham and some great fight sequences elevate an otherwise mediocre film
","If writer/director Boaz Yakin just keeps making films with Jason Statham, I may just forgive him for his involvement in the travesty that was the '80's Punisher film. Well OK not THAT, but perhaps it would however cleanse my mouth of the rancid taste that From Dusk Til Dawn 2 left.",/review/rw2809087/?ref_=tt_urv

Luke King (Jason Statham) is a cage fighter following leaving an elite NYPD special ops unit after betraying corrupt colleagues.

21 May 2012,thinker1691,8," "" When Two Tigers chase the same prey, it's deadly, . . But when there's three, it's Lethal! ""
","The Writer/Directer of this exciting and explosive film called "" Safe "" is Boaz Yakin. Needless to say, he keeps his action star Jason Statham who plays Luke Wright, directly in the line of some very hostile fire. Luke was a former NYPD detective who for some reason was cashiered from the police force. Now down-on-his-luck, he finds himself Cage fighting to make ends meet. Seen as a derelict drunk, with his wife murdered, he is roughed up by corrupt cops, pursued by Mob bosses and Chinese Triade hit men alike and is so despairing he considers committing suicide. However, a little Chinese girl named Mei (Catherine Chan) is also being chased by both Russian and Chinese gangsters alike for a secret combination to some valuable information, saves him. Taking refuge under the protection of the disgraced policeman, they both share a common bond, . . . to find safety. From it's inception, this exciting film is a, trill-ride full of dramatic car chases, crashes and gunfire of all sorts. Together the cast which includes Robert John Burke as Captain Wolf and James Hong combine to create a most memorable movie. ****",/review/rw2809087/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2013,robinski34,7," As Houses
","Like Bruce Willis without the one-liners, but possessing a much larger can of 'whupass', The Stathe tears the New York underworld a new one in this rollicking, no nonsense thriller. Catherine Chan is excellent as Mei, and there is a believable relationship between the two, although the set up in the film's initial scenes feels rushed. Once things get down to business there is no compromise, nor punches pulled, only young Mei could come anywhere near being described as good, but Statham's 'Luke Wright' at least has an honourable cause at the heart of his killing spree. The plot moves quickly enough that you will be too busy counting the holes in the bad guys to see the ones in the story, but if you are able to hang on in for the ride, this is flashy flick with something worth fighting for at its heart.",/review/rw2809087/?ref_=tt_urv
