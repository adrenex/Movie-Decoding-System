14 August 2018,cmorrisroberts,8," 1-6 FAB Series 7 - not so much
","I absolutely loved series 1-6. I couldn't stop watching. I think I must have watched them all in less than a month. It took me to a land far away, and into that little fantasy world that's not reality world. BUT. I'm sad to say that series 7 is such a disappointment. I'm only on episode 6, and instead of watching it I'm writing this review. I wish I was one of these people that can give up and didn't have to watch the entire series of programmes. I'm going to pretend, after watching series 7, that they all lived happily ever after, after series 6.",/review/rw5129281/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2018,allisonnp,9," The first few seasons were the best!
","Seasons 1-3 were excellent! I could not stop watching. Then 4-6 came along, and I thought they were pretty decent but definitely worse than the first three. I think that the show could have just ended after season 6 but nope... They had to make a terrible 7th season",/review/rw5129281/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2018,unityhimym,7," Don't watch all the seasons
","A very interesting concept for a show, the first season was rather interesting and had an compelling storyline. The way the fairytale world is mixed with the real world is beautiful. The main characters in the first season, regina and emma, are interesting and the storyline is wrapped up nicely by the end of the season. In the second season, there is a lot of character development and more fairytales are connected with the characters, again done beautifully, fairytales are intertwined, resulting in an exciting storyline. In the third season, new characters are introduced and they travel to new locations. This season is overall less compelling than the first and second season, and slower-paced, but still enjoyable to watch. Although the first half of season 4 still shows some enjoyable content, this is the turning point for the series, after this it seems like show was just going on for the sake of going on. Season 5 isn't gripping at all and it feels like they just ran out of ideas. Season 6 is a weaker version of season 5 and season 7 is just plain boring. Watch no further than the first 3 seasons, and maybe give season 4 a shot.",/review/rw5129281/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2017,StorieLuver,4," Season 7 is completely unnecessary
","(This review is strictly for the new season; if I were rating the show on the first 6 seasons I'd probably give it an 8).
So apparently ABC/Disney doesn't know the phrase ""Get out when the getting's good."" OUAT came to a perfectly natural, satisfactory conclusion at the end of Season 6 and they should've just let the show end there. But no, they had to insist on a reboot, and it's basically a dumpster fire. Specifically, the casting of the 3 leads is awful. The new Cinderella is a 40 year old trying to play a 20 year old. (There's nothing wrong with older actresses getting parts, but when they do they should act their age. Instead, we get a 40 year old trying to dress and act like a hip millennial and failing miserably; she even has a stepsister young enough to be her daughter). Maybe it's because Cinderella is trying so hard to fit into a role that's too young for her, but there is absolutely ZERO chemistry between her and the new ""adult"" Henry. Now HE is your stereotypical millennial, and I don't buy him as either Cinderella's love interest or the new kid's father figure. At least in the original series, young Henry was cute and endearing. The new girl is whiny, obnoxious, and far from cute. If I was rating the new season on just these three, I'd be giving it only a single star. However, there are the redeeming features of the Hook/Alice and Drizella/Rapunzel stories, and they are the only parts that caused me to give this 4 stars and keep watching. Without those secondary stories, I would've stopped watching this show back in the fall.",/review/rw5129281/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2011,zactac,10," The previews sparked my interest and the pilot just hooked me.
",Once Upon a Time already shows much potential with a great pilot episode. It really got to the point without giving everything away. It basically tells the background information behind the story seen in the shows fictional town of Storybrooke. It does this in just the right way so that the viewer won't get confused or bored from just hearing the talk of fairy-tales from the side of a little boy.,/review/rw5129281/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2017,TheLittleSongbird,6," Was great once upon a time, but has lost its magic
",What a shame! When 'Once Upon a Time' first started it was highly addictive and made the most of a truly great and creative premise. Really loved the idea of turning familiar fairy tales on their heads and putting own interpretations on them and the show early on clearly had clearly had a ball. Watched it without fail every time it came on and it was often a highlight of the week.,/review/rw5129281/?ref_=tt_urv

However to my ever happy surprise this show is amazing, beautiful acting, terrific plot lines, and they weave it together so perfectly that you really just have to applaud the way its done.",/review/rw5129281/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2018,riannedeheij,6," Should have stoped at season 6.
","I realy liked the first 6 seasons, but i simply do not understand why they made a 7th season. Wich does not even have a original start...
If you can't think of something new, just don't make a new season then.",/review/rw5129281/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2018,lin_mehmed,," Season 7, what a tragedy.
","It's so sad to say this but I used to really like this show, up until season 6, when things should have ended. Why did they decide to do a season 7 with the same story line as before, my brain will never understand. I despise season 7. I can't stand ""Cinderella""s character or the actress. The character just seems so weak, without any motivation or attitude to live life or to act, which isn't how I pictured Cinderella. I thought she would be more rebellious and have more of a spirit. Don't even get me started on the actress - she has no acting skills, I feel like every line is improvised and the directors just went with the first shot they took. At least try to pronounce words correctly. ",/review/rw5129281/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2018,SnoopyStyle,6," strong start, long decline
","In the town of Storybrooke, Maine, the residents are former fairy tale characters. The Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla) had cast a spell at the wedding of Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas) leaving everyone with no memories of their origins. Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) is an exceptional bounty hunter in the city. A boy named Henry knocks on her door claiming to be her son and she's the only one who could save his town. Other characters include Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle), Belle (Emilie de Ravin), and Captain Hook (Colin O'Donoghue).",/review/rw5129281/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2018,pat-08514,9," First Six Seasons are Awesome!
","I loved the first six seasons of Once Upon a Time, and actually binged all six seasons twice and eagerly awaited the arrival of season 7. There are few shows I can recommend more highly than the first six seasons of Once but seven was beyond disappointing. I couldn't make it through the first episode. Not even Colin O'Donoghue and Robert Carlisle could save it. I hated all the new and revamped characters. They lacked the class, style, fun and imagination of the original cast and the story itself was absolutely lackluster. ",/review/rw5129281/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2019,callladd,5," One Season Wonder
","I gave this show a try because of Robert Carlyle and was instantly a fan of not just Gold/Rumple but also Regina, Mary Margaret/Snow, Emma and the inventive storytelling. Season 1 started out strong and stayed that way through the entire season. The action in the modern world and the character's backstories were interesting and the cliffhanger endings of each episode had me excited for the next one.",/review/rw5129281/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2011,Jedi_Rumor,10," Creative
","I really enjoyed the pilot episode. It was refreshing to view a show that was not another reality series or ""dare"" show. This series brilliant mixture of classic fairy tales that adults have grown so familiar with and blended it with creative story lines. The acting was well done and the special effects were as well. The casting was well done and I couldn't imagine any other actor/actress playing the parts. Without giving too much away it's worth investing the hour to view! I can't wait to see the second episode and recommend this to any one who is/was a fan of Disney movies/Lost. Older children may even enjoy watching the series",/review/rw5129281/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2013,A_Different_Drummer,1," puts viewer in a magic land ... where nothing ever happens...
","Don't mean to be harsh here but you need to draw a line in the sand, even if the sand is actually fairy dust and you draw it with a magic wand. Once upon a time (a-ahem) when the world was green and TV was new, there was a hit series called THE FUGITIVE about a man wrongly accused of murder. The show was well-acted, well-produced, well-written. It was a hit. On the final episode after a wonderful run, the real killer was finally caught and the hero was vindicated. But that was not the real ending. The ""real"" ending was that, with the villain caught, viewers lost interest in watching the series in re-runs, and much income was lost, at least to the producers. And a valuable lesson was learnt -- never resolve any story, if you can avoid it. OK, flash forward a half century. In today's world viewers have somehow become a lot more comfy with paradox and ambiguity and, seemingly, can now watch for hours on end -- literally -- without ever knowing or caring how the story ends. Which is the premise of this show, reduced to the bare bones. Instead of making the fairy tale about the ending, make it about the story. Use quality actors, scripts, production values, knock yourself out. But -- here is the key - like another fairy product from Hollywood, prophetically called THE NEVER-ENDING STORY, just make sure each episode ends with more problems than solutions. If you dig deep through the 100s of IMDb viewer reviews here, you will find others who have noticed the exact same thing. Just when you think an episode is about to resolve, it instead spirals out of control. Clearly, this is not enough to dissuade viewers -- OMG, they have spun off a sister show! -- but for historians of the future, it does raise issues about the attention span of the modern TV watcher. For breaking just about every basic tenet of core narrative fiction, albeit profitably, this show is just plain wrong. I don't expect much agreement, but I need to point out the obvious. And here is a footnote -- you have to wonder aloud if the two Jennifers each initially read for each other's parts. Narrative aside, the show would have been more interesting had the roles been switched.",/review/rw5129281/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2018,ktillsley,6," Season 7
",I'm sad to say but I truly think it's time for the show to end. It was amazing especially season 1 and 3. But it has incredibly gone down hill. I still watch as a cliff hanger now will be sad. I never thought the day would come when I'd rate any less than 10/10 but now 4/10 I think is reasonable,/review/rw5129281/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2016,Auntie_Inflammatory,5," Time to say, ""The End.""
","I really liked the first season or two of ""OUAT"", it was different than anything else on network TV, it was a cute concept, it was fun. Unfortunately, it's really gone downhill in the last few years and I think it's time for this fairy tale to reach ""The End."" ",/review/rw5129281/?ref_=tt_urv

",I enjoyed the first 6 seasons immensely My Rating 10 but the current one no 7 is SOOO BAD!! My rating 3 :( Dania Ramirez looks old and like she is always in pain here we have a nearly 40 year of woman playing Hendry's Cinderella but looks more like his MOM probably double his age and looks it to :( and her acting is sub-par!! she should go back to Devious Maids where not much acting is required. I was looking forward to this now I'm just fast forwarding hoping this is a nightmare scene and we all go back to Storybrook with a Happy ending not the Disaster!!,/review/rw5129281/?ref_=tt_urv

","I know that some people hate this show but I love the sheer absurdity and corniness of it.

15 March 2020,danieldwilkinson,10," Fanstasies come to real life!
","Oh man this show was awesome! Seeing all my childhood disney characters in live action, each season being a main focus on a certain character while still introducing other small new ones, and reoccurring ones. I jumped on board just before season 3 or 4(peter pan one). And was able to binge it before that season aired. So many great characters, and so many great moments. Regina being one of the best characters with what I would say is the best development. The final season was enjoyable and cool how it started out the way the show started, but was odd and confusing at the same time which (while it made the ending a happy one and if I recall was more satisfying then the second to last season finale) made it feel strange to me.",/review/rw5129281/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2011,delightful-life,," This is a good show. Maybe the best one launched this year.
","So many new shows came out this year, and this is one of the good ones (along with Homeland and Person of Interest) Its a fantasy show bringing two time-lines together, an ancient one with magic, witch-craft and all, and the present one. They keep switching between the two and its beautiful.",/review/rw5129281/?ref_=tt_urv
