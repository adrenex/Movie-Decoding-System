11 June 2020,xiomatic,9," Stark, claustrophobic and real
","Bemused at the reviews of ""boring"" or ""too long"". This is not Apollo 13 or The Right Stuff, and is not meant to be. It is a character study based on a book James R Hansen which is a biography of Neil Armstrong, rather than a story of the moon landing per se. Of course the movie is going to show the moon landing, and the events which lead up to it, but these are just part of what the movie is about.",/review/rw4879946/?ref_=tt_urv

16 October 2018,Jared_Andrews,8," Excellent Understated Biopic
",The opening scene will take your breath away. I don't think a single cell in my body flinched for a solid five minutes as I watched Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) fight to keep his craft from floating away into space. The scene is spectacular visually and in every sense of filmmaking execution. It's also a bit misleading. ,/review/rw4879946/?ref_=tt_urv

3 October 2018,bobzmcishl,7," Good, Not Great
","I saw this movie at a sneak preview, and I had high expectations given the hype, but sadly, this was no ""The Right Stuff."" The problem may lie in the main character on which the movie is based, Neil Armstrong. He is portrayed as a colorless technocrat, who is somewhat cold to his family. The movie focuses mainly on his family relationships, and the landing on the moon is somewhat secondary, therefore the movie lacks a lot of drama. This is unfortunate since Armstrong led a very charmed life as a fighter pilot, test pilot, and astronaut. The movie covers three of his serious incidents while flying, and he had at least three more, that could have been covered in a miniseries. A miniseries would have allowed for more in-depth probing of how Armstrong became the man he was. The main characters all suffer from superficial once overs. The astronauts were all household names but you wouldn't know it from this movie. The movie also had a hard time capturing just how terrifying some of the events were. Apollo 13 did a far better job of recounting the terror of that flight. Claire Foy as the wife was ok but she also had a degree of coldness about her. The movie also glosses over the misplaced disdain military pilots had for their civilian counterparts. The complaint was that civilian pilots by virtue of their engineering training were too mechanical and not true flyers. This was not true of Armstrong who got his pilots license at the age of 17. The movie should have started there. He was considered a brilliant engineer by his peers, and he was rightfully selected to be the commander of Apollo 11. That brilliance is not captured on screen. By the end of his career he had flown over 200 different aircraft. He was a giant. I think the movie should have brought that out.",/review/rw4879946/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2018,TheLittleSongbird,7," To experience the impossible journey
","'First Man' intrigued me from the get go. It was based on one of the most important and fascinating true stories and achievements there's ever been, and a very interesting man. It had talented actors such as Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy, both of whom have done a lot of fine work. And it was directed by Damien Chazelle, responsible for 'Whiplash' and 'La La Land' which for me were both among the best of their respective years.",/review/rw4879946/?ref_=tt_urv

","First Man is a historical biographical drama film based on the life of astronaut Neil Armstrong, directed by Damien Chazelle (Whiplash, La La Land). Starring Ryan Gosling in the lead role, it paints a beautifully told and respectable portrait of the famous astronaut's life and the significance of his contribution to human history.",/review/rw4879946/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2018,ozjosh03,4," Over-long, over-hyped, over-rated
","The only real distinction of First Man may be that it's the first over-hyped and over-rated film of next year's Oscar crop. It's a film that is dismally defeated by its own subject matter at every turn. First it wants to be an illuminating, insightful study of Neil Armstrong. But on the evidence of everything it offers, Armstrong was simply not that interesting. If the most startling discovery about your hero is that he was sad about his infant daughter's death, then you're already in deep trouble. Nor is it hugely surprising that a guy who is dedicated to preparing for a mission to the moon isn't exactly a well-rounded, socially adept human being. But many a fascinating film has been built around a cerebral, emotionally-distant, socially awkward character, right? True enough, but it takes an actor with a much greater skill set than Ryan Gosling to make such a character interesting. First Man is essentially two hours of Gosling mooching around trying to find some way of making Armstrong's interior life compelling. That he fails isn't entirely due to his own shortcomings as an actor, but to a screenplay that does little more than rely on his good looks and the ""glamour"" of the space race to make Armstrong interesting. But the second big fail of First Man is that it doesn't offer us anything particularly new or interesting about the moon mission. Chazelle's strategy is to eschew the cliches of space movies - the focus on technology and the astronaut's eye view - and stay close on his heroes through interminable sequences in juddering space capsules. There's nothing new about this, other than it being the main, sometimes sole focus. Unfortunately, it becomes tedious long before we get to Apollo 11's trek to the moon. Even the ultimate moon sequence offers little that we don't already know from the grainy footage of the real event that everyone has seen hundreds of times. In short, the term ""epic fail"" could have been invented to describe First Man.",/review/rw4879946/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2018,cliff_bd,4," I understand what the movie was trying to achieve but....OMG it was so boring
",I really liked the idea and I kinda liked the movie but I found it to be disjointed and slow...... I loved the part of the movie when Neil Armstrong was on the Moon and he dropped his dead daughters braclet into the crater .... to let her go,/review/rw4879946/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2018,Bertaut,6," Aesthetically laudable, emotionally vapid
","More an intimate character drama than a grandiose examination of man's place in the cosmos, First Man is far more concerned with domesticity than the actual journey to the moon, attempting to demonstrate that behind the great moments of history exist personal demons and private motivations. Nothing wrong with that of course - contextualising small character beats against a larger historical canvas can produce excellent cinema. ",/review/rw4879946/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2018,maurice_yacowar,8," The humanity and heroism of astronaut Neil Armstrong
","On the level of plot the title refers to subject Neil Armstrong, the first human to set foot on the moon. The level of theme points elsewhere: The man precedes and predominates over the astronaut.
From beginning to end the film puts us into Armstrong's life, his experience. First as a father, his heart broken by the cancer death of his little daughter, then living a dedicated, stoic model for his young sons. The older son's handshake shows the promise of his manhood., Then as a husband - sorely testing and relying upon his oak-strong wife. Finally, as the professional, disciplined, dedicated, steady even as his friends die on their parts of their mission.
Ryan Gosling gives Armstrong a profoundly sunken emotional life, feeling deeply but all expression virtually buried. But for one outbreak, he keeps his head about him privately as well as professionally. His job interview for the Apollo mission is the most revealing since Judge Kavanaugh's.
The film reminds us how human our heroes are. Their losses, suffering and demands upon them and theirs make their successes so much more impressive than those of the superheroes. That makes this film so much more engaging and emotionally illuminating than the abstractions of Kubrick's 2001.
Finally, this film very much addresses the American moment. That was the Kennedy future. There's a sad nostalgia in harkening back to an American government that respected science, that propounded lofty ideals and that embraced America's responsibility of giving the world political, scientific and moral leadership.
For me three moments stand out. One is the repeated scenes of the capsule spinning wildly out of control, Armstrong manfully trying to recover its stability. That's the true American, of the great America, trying to bring stability to chaos, in the lab as on the globe and beyond. The good old days.
Then there's Armstrong's rationale for the space exploration program: ""I don't know what space exploration will uncover, but I don't think it'll be exploration just for the sake of exploration. I think it'll be more the fact that it, allows us to see things. That maybe we should have seen a long time ago. But, just haven't been able to until now."" His craving for the fullest possible perspective upon mankind and the universe is so at odds with today's willful ignorance and tribalism.
And the last shot. Armstrong and his wife have been through so much that separated them - even beyond the shattering loss of their child - that their reunion still carries a chill. They have so much gap to cross. In the quarantine room they can only play at a touch, through a glass darkly, a gathered pain between them. It's the perfect end to a story of heroism so dearly bought. And an America so sadly lost.",/review/rw4879946/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2018,jlthornb51,10," Incredibly Moving, Visually Stunning, and Simply Breathtaking.
","I was fortunate to see this fantastic movie at a small film festival in Oregon and it was a wonderful cinematic experience. A Visually stunning story of one of the great achievements of humanity. The science is fascinating and the effort behind that science is paid a wonderful tribute. The journey to the moon is as much a spiritual one as a human achievement. The men who made that trip are portrayed in all their humanness and incredible dedication. This is indeed a patriotic film and despite some controversy regarding not depicting the planting of the flag on the moon, flags are everywhere in the movie and the flag is certainly shown at the landing site. There is no doubt this was an American accomplishment and that is clearly celebrated. The inexplicable controversy about the U.S. flag is one of those contrived internet stinks from fringe elements who have never seen the film. It would be a tragedy to allow such nonsense to savage a film that is so inspiring and emotionally satisfying. This is a spectacular, exciting, stunning film and it should be seen by everyone as a reminder of the beauty of what happened in July, 1969.",/review/rw4879946/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2019,UniqueParticle,8," Slow paced wonderful biography about Neil Armstrong
","Damien Chezzele is a phenomenal director at least for Whiplash and La La Land, maybe not so much except bits of incredible cinematography! Ryan Gosling is pretty good except a little bleak and I still this deserves a fair rating. Mostly interesting to look at and the acting is spot on, but at the same time there are plot holes like others made more in depth note of regardless it's a marvelous film purely cause I don't think Neil Armstrong's story has been done at least not much.

27 October 2018,bob-the-movie-man,10," He captured a feeling. Sky with no ceiling.
","I am a child of the 60's, born in 1961. The ""Space Race"" for me was not some historical concept but a pervasive backdrop to my childhood. I still recall, at the age of 8, being marched into my junior school's assembly hall. We all peered at the grainy black-and-white pictures of Neil Armstrong as he spoke his famously fluffed line before stepping onto the lunar surface. The event happened at 3:54am UK time, so clearly my recollection of ""seeing it live"" is bogus. (I read that the BBC stayed on air until 10:30 in the morning, so it was probably a 'final review' of the night's events I saw). It is probably lodged in my memory less for the historical event and more due to the fact that there was TELEVISION ON IN THE MORNING! (Kids, ask your grandparents!)",/review/rw4879946/?ref_=tt_urv

20 October 2018,daniel-dippel,9," Thru the eyes of the first man
","I now laugh when I reread some of the negative reviews - to summarize: it made me have motion sickness so I left, didn't develop the orher characters enough, too somber and brooding, didn't cover all of the events of Niel Armstrongs career, etc. Well, most of these individuals missed the point of the movie or don't understand this genre of storytelling. It is a first person account basically told through the eyes of the first person to walk on the moon. I found this refreshing and not your typical Hollywood approach of trying to fit too much, too thinly for such an epic sweeping story that covers decades and dozen of key figures. It could have been 3-3.5 hours long. Yes, it could have been a TV mini-series or two (or more) movies. I love that it was told through the eyes of one central figure. Told through the eyes of the man that all of the accumulated effort of thousands of people and billions of dollars spent to accomplish one goal before the Soviets and for humankind - having a human step foot on the moon for the first time. I cannot remember a cinematic experience that got me as close to experiencing what it was truly like to be there first hand, in the drivers seat if you will, or better put, insabely strapped into a coffin fixed atop a massive liquid fuel explosion. How any person would be brave enough to face this, be able to perform well while in the thick of it and want to do it again and again is beyond words (or sanity). With death and fear all around no wonder there was a dark cloud hanging over everyone. I am sure all of us have marvelled at what has been accomplished by the NASA space missions especially Apollo. The movie Apollo 13 was a very good story that I thought put me as close to being an Astronaut as i could get. I was wrong. So, go and see First Man. Go and let yourself become THE astronaut. THE first human that was there at the very top of a giant pyramid of people because many before had made the ultimate sacrifice to make possible one giant leap for mankind. i will never look at another manned space vehicle, past or present, or astronaut again the same way,",/review/rw4879946/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2018,biggiebaby,4," Like watching a metronome.
","Gosling at his one dimensional best. Cluncky and disjointed, the story rides along like a low budget wannabe art film, but, with high budget actors. No character development to speak of just long lonesome staring off to the right of the camera lens. With the possible exception of the ubiquitous wife/mother scene demanding emotions from the husband/father.

18 October 2018,essential-23126,8," Highly recommended.
","I really enjoyed First Man. It was realistic, emphasizing the skills of the astronauts and the risks they took in this endeavour. Ryan Gosling very good as Neil with an excellent well known supporting cast of actors. I particularly liked the emphasis on the families of the astronauts, especially Neil's wife and children and the effects of his job on their lives.

18 October 2018,CubsandCulture,10," Chazelle is 3 for 3...
",For my money Chazelle is the best young director working today and First Man is another smashing success. Mostly interested in the subjective feelings experienced by Armstrong during space travel on the one hand and the human cost to his family on the other this is a gripping portrayal of man who loses himself to impossible work to hide his grief. The story does de-empathizes the political aspects (most are mentioned in passing) of the history but it does so to focus on the personal. Through I love how the question of whether the social-political cost of the space program is worth its benefits is asked along side the question of with whether the human cost to Armstrong's family is worth it. It makes everything personal about this telling of the story,/review/rw4879946/?ref_=tt_urv
