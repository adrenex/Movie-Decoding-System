15 October 2011,TheLittleSongbird,8," Powerful and heartbreaking
","Blue Valentine is not an easy film to watch and it drags at times. That said, it is very powerful and heart-breaking. Two things especially make it so. One is the script, which is full of genuine emotional credibility and never falls into the trap of being too clever. The other is the story, with the time-skipping structure proving interesting and the story itself is so well-observed. Blue Valentine is shot beautifully yet with a lot of grit, and the soundtrack is amazing, for one it is one of 2010's best soundtracks. The film is also sharply directed, and the film instead of straightforwardly tracing the rise and fall of their relationship actually contrasts the young couple's hopeful beginnings with their subsequent grinding domestic discord. Some mayn't like this approach, I found it incredibly interesting and thought it worked wonders, considering how much effort was made into making this approach credible. The performances from Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams are simply wonderful, their characters are not the most sympathetic characters in the world, nor I don't think were they intended to be, but the performances themselves and the chemistry I couldn't fault. Overall, a very powerful and moving film. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2339856/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2011,dharmendrasingh,9," Is romantic love the ultimate form of masochism?
","Director Derek Cianfrance may wish to stop wasting his talent on TV and make films his full time occupation. Cinema could use him. His 'Blue Valentine' studies the breakdown of a marriage through beautiful and heartbreaking juxtaposed scenes of past joy and optimism with present scenes of misery and depression. Flitting back and forth in the marriage, it asks: Is romantic love the ultimate form of masochism?",/review/rw2339856/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2011,deproduction,8," A heart-wrenching and cautionary tale of love
","I came away from this film more wary of love and relationships than any film I've ever seen. You look at Dean's character (Gosling's best role to-date) and wonder what it is that he did wrong. He fell for a beautiful, young woman (Williams), stepped-up to care for her and her yet-unborn daughter, and shifted his life to focus entirely on being a good husband and father. He was so charming in his interactions with his daughter, and was also loving towards his wife enduring more rejection from her than most could, trying to breathe love back into the relationship. Even his outbursts seemed attempts to give her what she wanted.",/review/rw2339856/?ref_=tt_urv

","Surprisingly well done. I was a bit skeptical at first, but as I traveled my way through this story, it made more sense than many other attempts to capture this concept and present it well. Michelle Williams really shines here, it may be her best role yet, at least that I'm aware of. ",/review/rw2339856/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2014,SnoopyStyle,7," Terrific performances
",Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy Heller-Pereira (Michelle Williams) are a married couple. This movie jumps back and forth to show their relationship over time. They have a girl named Frankie. He works menial jobs and she works as a nurse. He's a slacker and she's the tired responsible one. They both come from dysfunctional families. She runs into Bobby Ontario at the liquor store which causes friction between the couple. It turns out that Bobby is her former boyfriend with a big secret between them.,/review/rw2339856/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2011,ferguson-6,7," A Slow Dissolve
","Greetings again from the darkness. OK, so I was extremely surprised to be the only male in a theater with 30 plus viewers. I had not once previously thought of this as a chick flick. In fact, it is quite a weighty relationship expose' and that explains the lack of present men. What is surprising is that while the film is about the ever-so-slow crumbling of a marriage, there is no blame placed at the feet of any one person, as is so often the case in Hollywood.",/review/rw2339856/?ref_=tt_urv

3 December 2018,classicsoncall,8," ""Pack your bags, baby. We're going to the future.""
","Sad to say, but a lot of couples have been there. The conversation between Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) right after she ran into Bobby Ontario (Mike Vogel) in the liquor store was classic, with neither participant willing or able to come to grips with what was really bothering them. The entire story is so true to life it's scary, a virtual primer on how a once happily engaged couple falls into a dead end routine that ends in a shattering breakup. The flashback technique used by director Derek Cianfrance gets confusing at times, as the age difference of the characters over the time period involved doesn't always seem apparent, and I found myself more than once puzzling over when the story was taking place. But it's all brought back to the here and now in disappointingly tragic fashion for a marriage on the rocks with no chance of survival. Credit Gosling and Williams for making it work, both were commendable in their roles with Williams the more conflicted character with a wider emotional arc. First time date night couples beware, the word 'Valentine' in the title doesn't represent hearts and flowers; you'll only feel blue coming out of the picture.",/review/rw2339856/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2010,DirkesDiggler,10," Heartbreaking and Powerful
","I am going to soap box it here for a second. The MPAA (those fine folk who decide what rating a film will receive) ticks me off to no end. Their system feels arbitrary, outdated, and stupid. You can only use the ""F"" word once in the non literal sense and maintain a PG-13 rating. Because that's the problem, kids hearing the ""f"" word too many times. For want of any other description, it is terribly stupid.",/review/rw2339856/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2011,laura_macleod,," The complexities of human relationships
","Blue Valentine is a complex drama as it requires the viewer to take a step forward beyond the visuals and in to the depths of the psychological world of the protagonists and how they operate as human beings. The viewer needs understanding of their life experiences and how this effects their ability to love and be able to take part in a loving relationship. I really liked the film for these reasons - it stretches the viewer beyond the superficial and in to the psychology of love and why a relationship may fail due to unresolved issues and failures in early family relationships. The fabric of the story revolves around a kind young man who is drifting and without education. He yearns for love and it becomes clear that his yearning is also connected to his lack of family in early life and mother abandonment. He meets a lovely intelligent young woman who is hoping to become a doctor - she has a weakness and that is rooted in a promiscuity and lack of true connection with men - this is due to her father being a bully which is clearly shown. Fate throws these two young people together and a pregnancy issue brings them to marriage - whether or not the child is truly his is never totally explained. However, what is clear is that both of them are looking for love and the child serves as a catalyst for deeper connection. As the story emerges in the form of flashbacks, we are shown the gradual deterioration of a very promising beginning. I can pin this deterioration on a few factors which the film masterly leaves in the viewer's consciousness to discover. Firstly, the girl is not honest - she is not honest to herself and to her life wishes. She does not make decisions based on self awareness even though with her intelligence she is capable of that. She uses the love of the man to see her through a stage of being a mother that she has chosen but not with her whole heart. Meanwhile, the young man is not without flaws but he cannot find the structure in himself to improve himself as an individual; he sinks into a kind of lethargy probably sensing that he 'is not good enough' for the girl but not able to comprehend that if he had moved into education and goals, she would have respected him more. The film then moves into the territory of what we are capable of in terms of emotional damage in early life. This is a heart wrenching drama as you can see the potential of their love and how it is eroded by their subconscious destructive mechanisms and inability to grow together. The acting is SUPERB; I have total admiration for these two actors for these very difficult roles. I would like to conclude that Blue Valentine is not primarily a love story; it is fundamentally a story about human complexity and the journey it takes to shake off the past and to re-define the personality THROUGH love for another individual. Unfortunately sometimes the demons that people carry and the burdens of childhood are too strong and too overwhelming to survive even the greatest love. We are more than just emotion and in the pursuit of a loving relationship we need to be brave enough to improve ourselves, seek help and reach out for ways to grow within the initial love attraction and make it long lasting for life's long journey.",/review/rw2339856/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2012,kosmasp,10," Color me bad
","While the movie states that it is a love story, I think it depends on your definition of ""love story"" or how far that term stretches. Let me put it this way: This ain't your typical Valentines movie. It is heavy drama and it does depict relationship(s) very harshly. And because it feels so real, you can get sucked into it.",/review/rw2339856/?ref_=tt_urv

","This family album is familiar. A beautiful small town girl meets an eccentric but charming stranger and they fall in dumb. Five years and one enchanting child later, his romantic notions sustain the illusion of his happiness, but her reality is not so poetic. This is a quick snapshot of Dean, Cindy, and Frankie. What happens in this family is what happens to so many others when affection is replaced by contempt, when passive aggression becomes less the former and more or less the latter.",/review/rw2339856/?ref_=tt_urv

","Love is not only a product that always turns out great. Love is also not a energy that always lives forever. Even with the greatest memories, one doesn't necessarily hold on a love pattern with another person for his or her entire life. I was happy that Blue Valentine showed that side of love. Love can be filled with hatred. Love can express jealousy. It's a strong feeling, so why wouldn't it arise other strong emotions?",/review/rw2339856/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2012,michaelRokeefe,8," Even good love can go bad.
","This movie came highly recommended albeit depressing as hell. If you are not feeling down at the beginning of this drama, you will be by the end credits. Interesting, but seeming a bit disjointed through the use of flashbacks of a couple once madly in love of one another. Cindy(Michelle Williams)is driven by her job as a nurse at a medical clinic; while Dean(Ryan Gosling),an educational dropout and hopeless romantic, wallows in depression and his own emotional loneliness. Cindy has become bored and very disenchanted with her sexless and mundane married existence. Their small daughter Frankie(Faith Wadyka)becomes a pawn in the muddled once happy union. A trial of hearkening back the golden days fails miserably; all hopes of rekindled romance has already died. Also in the cast: John Doman, Carey Westbrook, Mike Vogel and Jan Jones. The myriad of flashbacks are held together with a soundtrack featuring Pat Benatar, Grizzly Bear, The Platters and a song that made the whole movie worthwhile... ""You and Me"" by Penny & The Quarters. Give this movie a chance even if your own mental health may be victimized.",/review/rw2339856/?ref_=tt_urv

16 November 2010,george-napper,10," Blue Valentine: The Most genuine and heartfelt romance in more than a decade.
","If ever there was a perfect film that defines the romantic relationship for the 21st century, Derek Cianfrance's 'Blue Valentine' is that film. We begin at a secluded ranch house where a little girl is trying to find her lost dog. We then see her father (Ryan Gosling) comforting her. Enter mom (Michelle Williams), the concerned mother who tries to balance work and her child's needs. Seems like a generally happy household, right? Wrong. Though they may not want to admit it, Dean and Cindy's marriage has been on the rocks for years. Dean decides to take his wife to a sex motel that ends up being more like a Star Trek motel to try to rekindle the way they used to feel about each other. The reason for their bickering is unclear until the flashbacks that have been following the main plot line give you a full understanding of why things have deteriorated so. You see them meet each other, fall madly in love, and then experience well, you'll have to see it yourself.",/review/rw2339856/?ref_=tt_urv
