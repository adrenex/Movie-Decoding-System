26 October 2018,ryansalamence,8," Mid9/10
","Aside from a couple minor issues I had with this film, I loved it. It just felt incredibly real. I didn't feel like I was watching actors. I felt like I was watching the lives of these kids unfold, and that those lives would just continue unfolding even when the camera wasn't rolling.",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2019,b-suhr01,9," Like the 90's if you were there
","This movie was the 90's skate scene to a T. The music, a mix of punk, indie and hip hop, the clothes, baggy pants and 2XL tees, drugs, underage drinking, and of course street skating.
If you were there, you know, if not you can experience a time that will never come back. Skating is not the outlaw thing you do to escape your sh!tty life anymore, it's city built skateparks and X games.
That's why this film hits hard. Everyone who was around then had their crew and every crew had the jokester, the pro, the poor kid and the hanger-on who wasn't really good but a nice dude so you kept him. That's what Stevie is in this film and that's why you feel for him.
Jonah Hill has made an authentic time capsule into the mid 90's that feels real and not forced.",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2018,Aktham_Tashtush,8," Jonah Hill presenting life in 90 minutes.
","As Jonah Hill debut ... bravo ,, he aced it both ways,, directing and writing ,, the movie has solid plot ,, as i was a 10 years old kid, Back in the mid 90's, even though i wouldn't say i relate to the events per say ""smoking and drinking and all"" but I have just felt it through the lingo, trying to fit in , find your group of friends and the music, Oh my!! the music was and emotional captivation. .. anyway , the script was really good ,, so balanced ,, when it gets somewhat slow, just for a second it picks up real fast..",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2018,dogmaticdogs,9," Excellent Film
","First off, the soundtrack is amazing. Second, the acting is superb. So good in fact, it actually feels like a documentary.",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2020,ronakkotian,7," If you grew up through the 90s, this would be a nostalgia fest
","The reason I wanted to check this film out was because of Jonah Hill. It's interesting to see actors give a shot at directing, writing or even both and for a first feature, Hill doesn't disappoint.",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2019,theethinethou,8," Entertaining- kids with heart
","Say what you will, even if Hill was trying to live life through the movie, so what? He did a great job. One reviewer mentioned a ten yr old boy and a 16 yr old girl would never hook up. What? All sorts of ""interesting"" things go on during this age, especially in the lives of, no offense man, hood skater rats.",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2020,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,9," Very well-made indie cinema deifying the 90s.
","Mid90s is Jonah Hill's love-letter and confronting examination of a decade we now look back upon with incomparable admiration and respect. It's got everything: skateboards, VCRs, Super Nintendo, Sony PlayStation, Ren and Stimpy t-shirts and gangsta-culture. It's a time-capsule movie that truly doesn't feel like it was made in 2018 at all: its setting and characters are that convincing in making us Belgrave we're back in the 90s. Sure it's not all sunshine-and-bunnies in the story: the main character suffers physical abuse from his older brother and his mother isn't the most accepting person on the planet, but the movie's exploration of camaraderie, sex and drugs and rock and roll, VidCam filmmaking, skateboards and no longer feeling like an outsider makes Mid90s quite the visual and story-based treat.",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2019,Horst_In_Translation,6," Jonah Hill the filmmaker delivers
","""Mid90s"" is an award-winning American movie from 2018. Writer, director and producer is two-time Oscar-nominated actor Jonah Hill. I must say I am not really big on him as an actor at all admittedly, but he did a really decent job with this one that I am almost tempted to say that he may very well be a better filmmaker than actor. The next years (and projects) will tell. It is far from his first effort as writer really, but this was his first ""real"" movie as a director. What he directed before were mostly music videos and definitely not too many at all. You will not really recognize many actors in his film here. The biggest name in the cast is without a doubt Lucas Hedges, a pretty young actor himself, but also already an Oscar nominee. He plays the protagonist's brother. The main character himself is played by Sunny Suljic. And while Suljic has received some accolades for his portrayal and certainly done a good job with a character that is in basically every scene here from start to finish, it almost never feels like a character study. It is a bit of everything. First of all, like the title says it is about depicting the 90s and what happened back then. There are many references to this decade that started almost 30 years ago already now. Man how time flies. The references include t-shirts and a lot of other stuff. There is a Mr. Burns Simpsons mention. I really liked the Guile Streetfighter shirt early on. Beavis & Butthead are included as well. And there is a lot more. I won't go that much into detail now. But you will recognize it when you see it. However, the longer the film went, the less frequent these inclusions were which I thought was a bit of a pity. Still Hill did a fine job without a doubt in making this film look extremely 90s. I mean if you showed it to an unsuspecting crowd and tell them this was made back in 1990, they probably would believe it.",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2021,havoke-74121,7," Jonah Hill has something special here.
","Where ""Jonah Hill"" places his characters, the way they speak, his direction. All of this speaks to me, cus a lot of us lived through moments like this. The love on display, carrys through any contrivances that you expect from a film like this.",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2019,kyosgod-39385,9," Our time ""was"" up
","Just incredible mixed feelings after watching: sadness for time passing by, melancholia for those ages and of course, joy for being part of them...Well done Jonah!",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2018,kjproulx,10," A Home Run for Director Jonah Hill
","It's fascinating to see certain actors and actresses try their hand at writing or directing, because you never truly know what to expect from their first outing. This has been a very surprising year in that regard, seeing John Krasinski's masterful work on A Quiet Place and Bradley Cooper's upcoming rendition of A Star is Born. That being said, I truly don't believe an actor/actresses will be able to top Jonah Hill's film Mid90s for quite some time, in terms of going from acting to directing. When a film can come out of nowhere and be hilarious, shocking, heartfelt, and realistic, all at once, then it's an immediate winner in my eyes. Coupled with the numerous things that this movie has going for it on and off the screen, this is the movie of the year in my opinion. Although the year still has quite a few films to go, I have a hard time believing something will impress me more than this film has.",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2022,zac-04879,8," Just Real
","Through Mid90s, Jonah Hill actually teaches as he realistically depicts skatepark teenagers. There's obviously a lot of raunchy jokes and coarse touches of humour, but the drama genre also strikes deep when it comes and deals with mature subject matter such as abuse and teenage alcohol use.",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2019,UniqueParticle,9," Very provocative but spectacularly fun to watch!
","I think the only problem is the over the top amount of profanity for minors otherwise loved everything about it! Jonah Hill is an incredible writer/director there's a few parts that felt so authentic, like one of the skate park scenes when a guy talks to a few of the boys, that was inspirational and several other bits like the skateboard store scenes were great! I also watched this on my 27th birthday, August 4th which was cool being from the 90's; spectacular film for what it is! I would've reviewed it several days ago, I was just a little busy.",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2018,dmasursky,6," Worth seeing but keep your expectations low
","There is a lot to love about this film. The actors are very natural and very engaging. The star, Sunny Suljic, is quite a find. There are a number of very moving scenes between the characters - we all have our burdens to bear.",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2021,Dougmd1974,9," Very real and honest movie
","I enjoyed this film. I was a older teen in the early 90s and it all felt very true and real to me. Visually appealing and reminded me of a lot of the events and times of that era before widespread use of cell phones. I do feel like the ending could have had a little more meat to it - it was a few weeks in the life of the characters - so while I did want a little more at the end it didn't ruin the honesty of the film overall. Nonetheless, it's still worth watching.",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2018,jdesando,," Brilliant Jonah Hill debut. LA in the mid 90's is positively romantic for a street kid.
","When Jonah Hill played the bright and nerdy stats guy opposite Brad Pitt in Moneyball, he was far more than the sclubby second banana that started his career. His mid90s, as writer/director, is one of the best coming of age story in recent memory.",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2019,huntforpickles,10," If you grew up in the mid 90s skateboarding...
","If you grew up in the mid 90s skateboarding, you will relate to this film. It was nostalgic AF. The soundtrack was on point. The skateboards, clothing, posters, CDs, and most of the set props were all as I remember in the mid 90s. It was so good. So much like we remember growing up. Skateboarding, hip hop, 40s and weed. If you know, then you know. I loved this film! Those little actors were incredible and totally believable. I felt like I was back in high school. Remembering how fun it was to be young and free. If you never lived that life, you'll never understand it. 10 stars!!",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2018,hollyrclemens,10," Hill doesn't disappoint with his debut film, Mid90s.
","Jonah Hill's directorial debut is an instant classic that is daring, heartwarming, and a visual masterpiece. The film follows Stevie, a 13 year old boy, who is searching to belong. He finds his place in a group of neighbourhood skateboarders, and learns that the life he imagines they live is much different than it seems. Hill's writing skillfully ensures that there are no details unnecessary to the story, and that no strings are left untied. Perfectly capturing the essence of finding family, love, and brotherhood, Hill's debut feels raw and perfectly balanced throughout. There are moments to laugh, moments to cry, and moments to feel an overwhelming nostalgia and joy. Hill's writing is clearly influenced by his own experiences growing up as a skateboarder in the middle of the 90s. The soundtrack to this film is the best I have heard for 2018. Although this film is somewhat niche due to it's subject matter, there will be something for every movie lover to enjoy. The cast of this film feel real and perfectly portray the characters they represent. This film will rejuvenate your youth, reminding you of conversations you've had as a teen. Jonah Hill ignited the Toronto International Film Festival with an unexpected- yet incredible, first film. I was left stunned, and you will be too.",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2018,Joetampa90,8," Larry Clark's ""Kids"" if it was a good movie.
","When I first saw the trailer for this movie months back it was hard to not see some similarities from Larry Clark's teenage slice of life movies from the late 90s and early 2000s. Once I saw the movie I was pleased to see while some parts may be influenced by Clark, the Mid 90s stands on its own as true winner.",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2021,kcitraro,9," Touched my 13 yr old inner child in me.
","I know that so many people are gonna watch this movie and just think it's memories of the skateboarding world in the 90's. But it was so much more than that to me. It brought up so many feelings from when I was 13 or so. Tryin to fit in.. fake it til you make it! I also had a sibling beat the hell out of me constantly. All I know, is a great movie makes you feel what they feel. And this movie did exactly that. Great cast of non branded actors that did an excellent job. ! Great casting of them. Great writing! Great directing. Great sound. My only criticism would be lighting. I always ponder why some movies are filmed so dark. We get it, it's a ""dark"" mood. But no one needs the lighting dim to understand that. All in all Great movie though. Just too short. I wanted it to go on.",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2018,masonfisk,7," THE SKATEBOARDERS ARE COMING, THE SKATEBOARDERS ARE COMING...!
","Jonah Hill's debut film as writer/director is an admirable piece of awakening. Feeling like an offshoot of Larry Clark's seminal 1995 film Kids, Hill takes a page from their playbook to chart the fascination of a latch key kid from a broken home (his brother beats him & it seems there is no father figure while the mother is off doing something) who falls in w/a gang of skateboarders who take him under their wing & give him a crash course on the bad things in life (drinking, smoking & of course skateboarding) which gives him a sense of purpose & belonging. An impressive list of needle drops are heard on the soundtrack (I picked out The Pixies, Bad Brains & The Mamas & the Papas to name a few) coloring the background of this low res effort which is a nice stepping stone for future efforts. Good work.",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2018,jsph_calabrese,8," Embrace the nostalgia / cliches
","Sure, it might not be the most original take on the coming-of-age story (Jonah Hill even admitted it is a movie built on tropes), but what makes it unique is the chemistry and exuberance shared between the 5 boys. It's also irreverent AF, which feels incredibly refreshing.",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2019,nogodnomasters,3," All kinds of sounds
","Stevie (Sunny Suljic) is a misfit looking to fit in. His older brother beats on him. He is raised by a single mom. He finds friends in a Skateboard crowd of underachievers, also called his ""ghetto friends."" They give him cigarettes, drugs, alcohol, and a night with a girl. Stevie is not a great skateboarder and takes a beating.",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2018,trevord-68114,9," Must see!
","I was a little nervous when I read that Jonah Hill was writing and directing a skateboarder drama. Being a skateboarder myself all my life, I really focused on how this movie was. Was it gonna be a wacky comedy or something serious? I walked out of the movie theatre with a massive smile on my face! This movie had the perfect tone to it. You really do feel for the characters and you really feel for Stevie. Growing up a skater, I really related to Stevie in the movie. while it focuses on a little kid becoming a skateboarder, it also deals with a lot of real life problems. Future, health, how hard some people's lives are. And this movie portrayed that beautifully! Hat tipped to Jonah hill! This is a must see not just for skateboarders for for everybody!",/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2019,justin-fencsak,10," A coming of age story for our times
",In actor Jonah hills first directorial debut the movie centers on fourth grade kids during 1995 in socal during an era in which music video games and skate culture collide. The acting is well done the music amazing and the way it's shot makes it look like one of those pan and scan VHS tapes from years ago. Give it a rental. Highly recommended.,/review/rw4655933/?ref_=tt_urv
