7 October 2010,Lady_Targaryen,6," Watchable, more because of the action stars united in a single movie then anything else
","A team of elite mercenaries, the Expendables, leaded by Barney Ross head to South America on a mission to overthrow a dictator of a small South American island. Barney and Lee, a knife enthusiast, meet the rebel Sandra and discover what is really happening behind the conflict in the city. Sandra is revealed to be the dictator's daughter, and during an ambush, they need to scape and let Sandra behind. But Ross cannot let Sandra there, and to make peace with his conscience, he and his team decide to go back to the Island.",/review/rw2298499/?ref_=tt_urv

22 September 2020,pawanpunjabithewriter,4," Ok. Overrated Action Movie
","I had expectations from this movie, and it didn't deliver a penny. So much action, so much explosion, sometimes good, sometimes unnecessary, but do we need only that in a Movie? What about the story? The story is highly predictable with not much to offer. It's just the action scenes that keep you in awe, but wait, that's not enough right?
I don't understand why is it unnecessarily made so dark, gloomy and depressing in the middle? The emotions during the halfway point has no meaning.
I do not recommend this movie. Plus it's highly overrated. Trailer was better, movie was worse.",/review/rw2298499/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2010,D_Burke,8," ""Expendables"" Reminds Us Why We Will Watch Sylvester Stallone
","""The Expendables"" is without question the most anticipated movie of the summer of 2010. Its cast is a who's who of established action film stars of the previous three decades. Even though the previews gave away the cameo by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, it still gave us just another reason to stand in line for this movie.",/review/rw2298499/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2010,TheCinemassacre,," Too much testosterone!
","Tough guys. Always going on suicidal missions. Threatened by bullets and blades. Running from explosions. Best friends waging wars. Nearly killing each other, then going to the bar later to laugh about it. Director and star, Sylvester Stallone, gets all his best men together to kick as much ass as humanly possible, allowing himself a severe beating from Steve Austin. Sly took a serious neck injury. Then he goes in front of a Comic Con audience and jokes about it. A man whose Double-""R"" franchises, Rocky and Rambo have both been highly successful. But he keeps coming back for more pain and putting his body on the line for the sake of entertainment. There's nothing tougher than that!",/review/rw2298499/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2010,thesar-2,1," The 'D-' Team
","Sure, Sylvester Stallone isn't the most bankable star. He's washed up and knows it. I appreciate that he knows, though writing and directing that theory into an incredibly shallow, talentless and pointless movie containing characters with zero depth or chemistry between each other and bringing other D-List stars down with himÂ…is just plain wrong.",/review/rw2298499/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," I enjoyed this movie
","A novelty film, the novelty being seeing all of these great action stars together in one big action film. Unfortunately, most of them are past their prime, and it's hard to share the spotlight. The action is great, but it just isn't enough to carry the film this time. The characters and plot just aren't developed enough.",/review/rw2298499/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2010,namashi_1,4," A Letdown!
","Sylvester Stallone is a legend, no two options on that! He is one of my favorite stars, I was crazy about him in his 'Rambo' days. As a fan, I expected a lot of entertainment from his latest flick 'The Expendables'. The film stars each and every Action Star, apart from Van Damme and Jackie Chan. It's obvious you'd except outstanding entertainment & bad-ass action from this one, right? Sadly, I got not even half of the entertainment I had expected.",/review/rw2298499/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2010,supertom-3,9," Sly's time machine. Lets go back to the 80's!!
","Ever since the film was first announced, way back in November 2008, Stallone's action ensemble spectacular, The Expendables, has been in the forefront of every genre fans mind since. Starting with the triple casting of Stallone, Statham and Li, it was awesome enough. Then add Lundgren, Rourke, Austin, Couture, Gary Daniels and Eric Roberts, and it sent fans into delirium. Then throw in a dash of Bruce Willis and Ahnuld Schwarzenegger, and bed sheets in explosive action movie poster adorned bedrooms around the world, were soiled! So after a year and a half plus, of waiting, does it deliver? Yes! The plot is kept very simple. There's no real surprise in the film, but fans aren't here for storyline. Better too simple, than to make things too bogged down in convoluted sub-plot. Sly leads his team of good guys, against Eric Roberts team of bad guys. The mission goes wrong at first, leading to the capture of the beautiful Sandra, a native who acts as contact for Sly's band of mercs at the mission locale. Sly decides it's in his best interests to go back on perhaps a suicide mission, to try and save the girl. His team join him for the last harruh.",/review/rw2298499/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2012,Big_River,6," Predictable.
","A typical action movie that checks all of the action movie boxes. Lots of explosions, shootings, killings and unrealistic fight scenes. ",/review/rw2298499/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2010,cybopath,10," Stallone does it again!
","After nearly a decade of disappointments Stallone shocked the movie world by making a 6th emotionally charged Rocky, he then went on to please fans by taking Rambo into a visceral brutally realistic war movie, now for his hat trick Stallone gave us something old and something new 'The Expendables' the type of movie kids dreamed about the early 90's, what if this guy & that guy and him where all in a film together. A little too late? Hell no! Never has this film been more needed. In a land of watered down PG-13 wire work action movies real action fans where desperate for some real old school action. (Cobra, Commando, Delta Force, Last Boy Scout..) The great thing about this film is even if it didn't have the cast it still would be a great action movie, the fact it has such a jaw dropping cast just makes it all the better. Stallone is growing as an action director, he brought some of his tense brutal techniques from Rambo but was smart enough to go a little old school for other scenes. Their are some very kinetic action sequences but not Parkinson's suffering cameraman techniques like the Bourn films.",/review/rw2298499/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2010,yellowbuket101,8," They don't get much more explosive than this!
","The expectation for this film is obviously very high with one of the best action hero line ups (if not the best) in cinematic history. So I went into this film with a little trepidation and a lot of anticipation. I can honestly say that I was not disappointed. This was a high octane, unbelievably explosive, funny, blood thirsty, proper action movie! This film would not have been out of place in the 80s, but manages to fit into the market of today's cinematic action experience. It is easily much more graphic and gory than most modern day action films, but this adds to the film and creates a degree of realism. Let's face it; if you go around killing people it isn't going to be pretty! This film did what it needed to do, it wasn't afraid to contain blood, guts and violence for the sake of an age restriction but also wasn't overly ridiculous. After all most of the people who will watch this film grew up watching the classic action films of the 80s and 90s and are old enough for a bit of gore.",/review/rw2298499/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2010,kezopster,9," Everything an Action Movie should be, times 2!
","Get ready to cheer. Be ready to laugh. Be ready to be amazed with wonderful, live action fighting scenes using everything from fists, to blades, to guns. I don't know how this movie avoided being cheesy, but darn it, it did! Mindless explosions? Not really. Excessive? Again, not really. I hate the sort of climax usually seen in an action movie where the pyrotechnics are the show. I want to see the actors/stunt-men doing their thing. I want to see people. I can see fireworks on the Fourth of July. (Though, trust me, there ARE fireworks in this movie, too.) The balancing of this many stars is incredible and pulled off remarkably well. When Sylvester Stallone made his final Rocky movie (Rocky Balboa), he said he did it as a ""thank you"" to the fans. Maybe that was the idea behind this one, too, though I heard a quote from somewhere that after seeing wimpy Tobey Maguire as ""Spiderman"" full of CGI and a stuffed/padded suit, he realized action heroes like himself were, well, expendable.",/review/rw2298499/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2010,zetes,7," Big and dumb, but it delivers exactly what it promises
","Sylvester Stallone enjoys his old age Renaissance with this amusing throwback to the cheesy action movies of the 1980s and 90s. It's dumb as Hell, and very poorly directed (by Stallone himself), but it does pretty much deliver. Stallone and Jason Statham lead a team of mercenaries, which also includes Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li, Terry Crews and some other tough guys. They're hired by Bruce Willis (who appears in one scene alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger) to infiltrate an island nation and assassinate the bloody general who has taken it over (David Zayas, who co-stars in the show Dexter). Stallone discovers that the general is really unimportant, and that the real villain running things is Eric Roberts, with former professional wrestler Steve Austin his second in command. Stallone doesn't really want to get involved in this crazy business, but is ultimately inspired to go through with it because of a rebel woman he meets there (Giselle ItiÃ©). The plot doesn't make a lot of sense, but there's a lot of explosions and beatdowns. It delivers what it promises, even if I did forget that I even saw it by the next day. Mickey Rourke has a nice small part as a former member of the Expendables, and Charisma Carpenter (of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel fame) has a nice part as a chick who dumps Statham.",/review/rw2298499/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2010,bob the moo,," Solid boys-own action but could have done with a few more thrills and a bit more in the way of comic relief
","With the cast it had it was no surprise that The Expendables was being hyped long before it arrived in cinemas anywhere. ""Could it be the greatest action movie ever?"" some magazines breathlessly asked themselves, assuming perhaps that the cast could somehow just produce a good film by virtue of all just being in it. The answer of course is ""no"" and I doubt anyone expected it to be any other answer. However the real question was can the film produce the boys-only, 1980's action movie fun that the 2010 summer season needed. The answer to this question turned out to be ""sort of"" because The Expendables has plenty to enjoy about it but yet somehow falls short of what it could have been.",/review/rw2298499/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2011,Leofwine_draca,7," Boom and bust, Stallone style
","I grew up on '80s action movies, still love them to bits and love watching ass-kicking on film. When I heard Stallone was making this film, featuring an ensemble cast of ageing action stars and deliberately harking back to '80s cinema, I was excited. I consider the 2008 RAMBO to be his best movie as star and director and I was hoping this would be somewhere nearly as good. It isn't, but it's still a fun movie. First off, the problems. The plot is all over the place. Long scenes are wasted introducing Jason Statham's ex-girlfriend character and then nothing happens with her â€“ she just disappears and you don't see her again. The story, about overthrowing the dictator of a small island in South America and tackling his nefarious businessman colleague, feels like a half-baked reprise of COMMANDO. But let's be fair here â€“ nobody goes to see THE EXPENDABLES for the plot.",/review/rw2298499/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2010,jwtrox08706,7," It does what it set out to do...It entertains
","Going into this film, I had some rather low expectations, but was hoping to see just a violent shoot-'em-up with an all-star action film cast. I was actually pleasantly surprised as to how entertaining this film is.",/review/rw2298499/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2010,Quinoa1984,5," for a dumb, 80's-inspired ULTRA-violent action movie... it could be better
","You'll get what you expect when you go see The Expendables. It's just one of those movies: if you're expecting it to be a non-stop action extravaganza with (almost) every big action dude, large or small, from the past thirty years, you'd get that, but if you're expecting it to be a big steaming pile of stupid action movie-ness taking from the dumbest of 80's action movies (at least in ""plot""), you'll get that. For me, and I don't think I'm entirely alone- you may think different looking at the message board and whatnot online, but just look closer- it's in the middle. It's neither a triumph nor a failure. It has such a cast that it makes it impossible to dislike, if only on guilty pleasure grounds. But it also doesn't really have the kind of gusto to take its BIG status and do something really interesting with it.",/review/rw2298499/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2010,MoronUnited,10," There's still some gas in the tank
","To put it bluntly, this is greatest action movie in ages. Sly has crafted a movie that is a perfect blend of story, comedy, and action that work together to keep the viewers locked in for the ride. It's a kind of action movie that has not been seen in decades, in that it's not about cramming explosions into a 90 minute block, rather telling an exciting story that involves characters you care about. The story is gripping and moving, the comedy is spot-on and releases tension, and the action, well....",/review/rw2298499/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2010,jdkraus,8," Exactly what I hoped for.
","I haven't seen a really good, hardcore, shoot 'em bang 'em up action flick in a long time. When I went to see this movie with a couple of buddies, that's what I was hoping for. My wish came true. ",/review/rw2298499/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2019,masonsaul,6," Fun action movie
","Despite both Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger being massively underutilized and forgettable villains, The Expendables is still a fun action movie. Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham give great performances. Jet Li, Mickey Rourke and Terry Crews are all really good. The action sequences are extremely fun and ridiculously over the top and it's well paced. The soundtrack is really good and the music by Brian Tyler is also really good.",/review/rw2298499/?ref_=tt_urv

20 August 2010,BA_Harrison,2," What's the matter, Arnie... been pushing too many pencils?
","I'm not stupid: I realise that 'x' times the number of action stars does not necessarily equal 'x' times the amount of action, but with the biggest names of the genre together in one supposedly bad-ass, big budget, testosterone fuelled film, directed by Rambo himself, I at least expected to feel a mild rush of excitement at some point during the whole thing. Instead, I just found myself cringing throughout, which was a tad disappointing, to say the least.",/review/rw2298499/?ref_=tt_urv
