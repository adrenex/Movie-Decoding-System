5 September 2020,ahmedgorshy,10," The story of a horse that changed my life
","The story of a horse that changed my life.
Yes Bojack Horseman is simply something more than an animation series about animals and humans living together, not that it is much bigger than that.
At first, I strongly objected to the evaluation of the first episode of Bojack, which scored 7.1, man. What is that? I watched it four times and laughed the same amount each time.
Anyway, let's start the review.
The first season was hugely funny and intelligent, but nothing was measured by the rest of the seasons.
The series starts from the second season and reaches its climax in the third and continues to evolve until the last episode that will leave you feeling a great emptiness around you after you finish this great show
Bojack is one of my top 10 so I won't talk more than that.
One of the few offers that deserves a high rating.
My rating 9.8",/review/rw3740506/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2018,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,10," Netflix has made a cartoon for the ages!
","BoJack Horseman is what modern Family Guy wishes it could be and then some; it's a black-comedy-drama show that looks into the life of a washed up television actor who's struggling to find happiness in his life and ultimately remains unsuccessful in achieving that. Who'd have thought a cartoon about an anthropomorphic horse would end up being one of the deepest things currently on television? I'm genuinely surprised by what this show had to offer for me the first time I watched it. The first season's initial half is a little slow, but from then on BoJack transcends into a wacky comedy-drama that is one of the bravest shows to confront the issues of depression, anxiety, loneliness and nostalgia.",/review/rw3740506/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2020,freemantle_uk,10," The best adult animated show
","Who would have thought that a show about an anthropomorphic horse set in Hollywood would be one of the most human shows ever made. That was what Raphael Bob-Waksberg managed with BoJack Horseman. It's a show that's hilarious and dramatic, satirical and tragic as we follow BoJack Horseman and his friends through the trials of life. The show could be nilhilistic and the characters could be prophetic about their own destinies *couch* Sarah-Lynn *couch.* BoJack Horseman offers up on the best portraits on issues like mental health and addiction and doesn't sugarcoat anything. This makes the show so relatable and lets it stand out.",/review/rw3740506/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2020,jwwalrath-227-85487,10," Superb dark comedy
","In a world populated by both people and anthropomorphic animals, Bojack Horseman (voiced by Arrested Development and SNL's Will Arnett) follows the life of the titular horse, a former sitcom star. Bojack isn't the best person and has a lot of emotional and mental issues. I loved this show and consider it one of the best adult animated programs of all time.",/review/rw3740506/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2019,doomedmac,9," Excellent
","One of the best things to ever come from Netflix, BoJack Horseman is excellent. The characters feel extremely real. They are flawed, but learn and grow as the show progresses. More people need to watch this showz",/review/rw3740506/?ref_=tt_urv

23 August 2014,Suicide_Saint,9," A Surprisingly Entertaining Series
","Like the incessant influx of superhero films currently pervading Hollywood, ""adult"" animation has become a genre that borders upon an overstayed welcome. As a result, my personal expectations for the Netflix original series ""BoJack Horseman"" were not particularly high, but I do like to keep an open mind. Much to my delight, the series provides humor, drama, well-written and connected story lines as well as solid character development. BoJack is simultaneously a disdainful but overall likable character performed wonderfully by Will Arnett. He is joined by a fabulous cast of characters / voice actors that instantly bring this show to the level of other modern animated successes such as Bob's Burgers. In fact, I could absolutely have pictured H. Jon Benjamin as BoJack, but he already seems to lend his voice talents to so many different areas. The series also provides a fairly original artistic presentation as the characters almost resemble a painted portrayal at times. The show is not only humorous, but also covers subjects such as unrequited love, self-loathing, substance abuse, betrayal, and other more serious concerns that really serve to draw the viewer into the series. Overall, ""BoJack Horseman"" is an incredibly impressive entry into the burgeoning repertoire of successful Netflix original programming and I hope to see this series continue for years to come.",/review/rw3740506/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," So Underrated!
","BoJack Horseman is easily one of the best animated shows ever created. It's about an self-loathing alcoholic horse named BoJack Horseman, who was once a sitcom star in the 90's and now wants to make a comeback 18 years after his show was canceled and he lost his dignity. I just started watching it after hearing so many great things about it and I'm so glad I did because it's amazing! It's absolutely an animated show for adults though! I can't really say anything that hasn't already been said. Just read through the reviews and see how loved this show really is. If you haven't seen this incredible show yet then stop what you're doing right now and go watch it!",/review/rw3740506/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2021,kevin_robbins,10," The comedic content was a nice blend of dry and consistent awkwardness
","BoJack Horseman is a series that came strongly recommended by my fianc√©e and is available on Netflix. The storyline focuses on a self indulged former sitcom star that has made some friends, some famous and some not so much, and follows his life as he makes bad investment, life, and friendship related decisions. This series was created by Raphael Bob-Waksberg (Undone) and includes voices from Will Arnett (Arrested Development), Amy Sedaris (Elf), Alison Brie (Glow), Paul F. Tompkins (There will be Blood) and Keith Olbermann (ESPN). The animation for this is fun in a Family Guy kind of way. The personalities and uniqueness of the characters is so good. Also, the concept of animals and humans living together was portrayed well. I really liked how they did it and the comedic content was a nice blend of dry and consistent awkwardness. Overall, this is a fun series for adults that I would score a solid 9/10.",/review/rw3740506/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2014,english-bill-34-910037,10," An animated show that feels more real than most live-action series.
","Netflix, in their continuing mission to provide premium content to their subscribers, has another hit on their hands with BoJack Horseman. I had some reservations before watching the first episode, because there hasn't been a great new animated series in several years now. But with such a great cast on board, I figured it was worth a try. So glad I did, because it ended up being the best original comedy I have seen in a while, animated or otherwise.

14 October 2016,andyrew670,10," One of the best adult animated shows I've ever seen.
","While the first season wasn't fully developed in it's characters and situations, I still enjoyed it very much, and had developed a bit of an emotional attachment during the last 3-4 episodes. But nothing could have ever prepared me for seasons 2 and 3, which offered some of the most poignant insights into celebrity culture and the nature of depression for a multitude of characters, which had by the time become grounded in their own right, I have EVER witnessed.

11 February 2021,stefstars,10," A Masterpiece
","I don't know why I took so long to watch this one, it had been recommended to me to plenty of times for the last few years. This became my favorite adult animated show. Rick and Morty is good with the subjects of nihilism and it has it's depiction of self destructive depression but it doesn't get it quite as right as BoJack Horseman. Every form of depression is presented in this show and they're presented in such an accurate way, I had tears in my eyes watching a talking horse go through similar situations I have been in. In some ways I relate to BoJack but I saw myself more in the characters of Diane and Princess Caroline. That's the beauty of this show, every character is relatable in some way but the way they've been written is so natural, it's not a forced depiction of the various damaged type of folks that exist in society.",/review/rw3740506/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2018,annabaloo,10," This show! Is! Too much! Man!
","Seriously though. Best show currently on television. 
At first, I thought it was another cartoon for adults only with poor drawings. But it's not. It's different.
For one, the jokes are funnier and the sads are sadder. The first season starts out more of a plain funny show, but beware this show will break your heart if you stick with it. 
It is also a really clever show - I'm sure that I'm not smart enough to catch all the references but sometimes I get the jokes and that feels good. 
Also, this show may be one of the depictions of depression on TV and movies ever.",/review/rw3740506/?ref_=tt_urv

","This show gave me goosebumps in almost every episode. That's it's power. Bong Joon Ho told you all to overcome the one inch distance of subtitles to be introduced to a whole new cinema, well I'm saying you all to get over your fear or repulsion of watching a ""cartoon"" show and just watch this one. Coz it's not a mere ""cartoon"", perhaps a greater show than most of the real ones. Not going to say anything else.",/review/rw3740506/?ref_=tt_urv

",Several reviews I've read on BoJack Horseman indicated the show was out of date. The show fits in more with the height of the Adult Swim reign of animation and not the intelligent output of American Dad or Archer.,/review/rw3740506/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2020,fiachnaprayingmantis,10," Colourful psychedelic journey through the dark night of the soul.
","I started watching Bo Jack when I was 17 years old.
I am now 23. This show grew in depth and maturity as I did. The way that it captures the darkness and ugliness of life, while also celebrating in its wild crazy unpredictability, is like nothing else.
While I struggled with purpose, meaning, mental health, drugs and the rich expanse of life that is sometimes so difficult, I felt I could relate to Bo Jack Horseman. It is a very honest portrayal of many things. And a very, very, gloriously silly way to do it.
I grew with these characters. There is something profound about this. This piece of art, that I know will never be done again. The attention and care and genius that is here, is worth celebrating.
Thank you for Bo Jack Horseman",/review/rw3740506/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2018,fanofmoststuff,9," #211 in Top Rated TV shows on this site but is much better than that.
","If you can get past the first three episodes will be witnessing a hell of a show. As they say with mental issues, ""It gets better"". And it sure does. This show is funny and emotional. They make you feel bad for characters out of your species, gender, and age range. Watching this made me relatable to characters I'd never expect to relate since they're so grounded. It's a bit over the top at times but it IS an animated show. Watch it and you'll get amazing fleshed out characters and stories that will make you think about life and your choices.",/review/rw3740506/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2020,LowlifeBinge,10," Not only the best cartoon ever, but one of the best TV shows ever created
","When I began this series, I had absolutely no clue how incredible it would prove to be. I was a fan of adult cartoons before seeing BoJack, I initially expected it to be one of those shows with some funny moments and occasional good messages, however upon viewing, my mind was completely blown. It was first recommended to me by a friend and I saw a few episodes, I thought it was okay but not amazing, but later on the new season (at the time) came out and he recommended it to me again, I picked up where I left off and after a couple more episodes, I was entirely hooked. Never before had I seen such hard-hitting, heartbreaking, emotional topics handled so elegantly, whilst still consistently achieving hilarious humor. In my opinion, BoJack is the second best TV show ever to exist (the first being Breaking Bad) and I 100% stand by BoJack as being the best show on Netflix, way better than the pathetic excuses for shows like 'Paradise PD' and 'Big Mouth'. I recommend this show to the moon and back, but get the tissues at the ready.",/review/rw3740506/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2020,MovieJunkie5,9," The show we didn't know we needed
","When I began watching in 2014 I was not expecting to be witnessing one of the best tv series, not only animated, on the making. It has everything for everyone, comedy, dark humor, drama, plot twists, a bunch of smart references that anyone gets to a certain point, philosophical messages, life lessons and so much more. Its truly one of the most complete and unique tv shows ever produced. Aaron Paul was one of my favorite characters, I couldn't possibly imagine Todd without his voice and character. The same could be said about Diane, Princess Carolyn, Mr. Peanutbutter and the horse himself, Bojack. A wonderful cast with such brilliant performances due to not only but also the fantastic and deep script by Raphael. Even though it was not their decision, I'm glad they ended BJH. This last season if one of the best I've seen, everyone got closure, including us. Its a masterpiece for the ages and a tv show to repeat several times, I bet it only gets better.",/review/rw3740506/?ref_=tt_urv

","A masterpiece of animation for adults that tackles many problems in a mature, profound and even amusing way. Very entertained for its entire duration, all beautiful, but the ending no, the ending ruined everything a bit, too bad because the series is wonderful but the ending makes no sense, it gives the protagonist a redemption that he does not deserve by giving a positive ending to a series whose narrative arc did not lead to this.",/review/rw3740506/?ref_=tt_urv

","At a glance, this show looks like your run of the mill wacky, raunchy adult cartoon comedy. And yes, it has plenty of that with the titular character's rude and obscene behavior, and a saturated slew of animal puns. There are wacky characters and absurd plots to be sure, but all of that eventually takes a backseat to the fact that Bojack Horseman is, at heart, a nuanced and overtly depressing show about pain and self-loathing.",/review/rw3740506/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2017,tmfc-65132,10," Very underrated
",Bojack Horseman is not another family guy or Simpsons because it actually tells a story that feels real. This is a funny and wacky cartoon but is actually has emotion unlike family guy. In family guy you get the same repetitive episodes pumped out with less emotion as the show goes on. Bojack Horseman manages to be really entertaining and funny but also makes you feel for the characters in the show. All the voice acting and animation is really well done and the writing is very clever at times. This is mostly because it finds a way to make fun of modern society and Bojack is the one who points it out to the audience most of the time. ,/review/rw3740506/?ref_=tt_urv
