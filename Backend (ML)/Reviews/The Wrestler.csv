8 December 2011,ma-cortes,6," A 14th century Crusader returns to a homeland devastated by the Black Plague and undertakes a dangerous adventure
","This thrilling film deals with 14th-century knights who transport a suspected witch to a monastery, where monks deduce her powers could be the source of the Black Plague which spreads death across the lands and villages , decimating life across Europa . Set during the time of the first outbreak of bubonic plague , a warrior is tasked with learning the truth about his fate as he is charged in leading a fearsome witch , as Beheman and his group of mercenaries have to go a remote location. It's an exciting story plenty of battles , action and excitement . The scenery is beautiful, and so was the cinematography . The music was great. The acting and directing was acceptable . A beleaguered church ruled by Cardinal D'Ambrosio (Christopher Lee), deeming sorcery the culprit of the plague, commands the two knights named Beheman (Nicolas Cage) and Felson (Ron Perlman) to transport an accused witch (Claire Fay) to a remote abbey, where monks will perform a ritual in hopes of ending the pestilence. A priest, a grieving knight (Ulrich Thomsen), a disgraced itinerant and a headstrong youth (Robert Sheehan) who can only dream of becoming a knight join a mission troubled by mythically hostile wilderness and fierce contention over the fate of the girl. The group must fight mysterious creatures for consuming every living thing in their path . Eventually surrounded by the frightening and ferocious foes, they must conquer his personal fears and help battle the illusive invaders who emerge out of the shroud of fog in the black of the night. When the embattled party arrives at the abbey, a horrific discovery jeopardises the knight's pledge to ensure the girl fair treatment, and pits them against an inexplicably powerful and destructive force .",/review/rw2838380/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2011,ManBehindTheMask63,," Not as bad as the critics say it is...Cage seems to care
","Season of the witch was a far better film than critics and fellow moviegoers led me to believe. The story is about Cage and Pearlman teaming up to take a witch to a castle where she will be put on trial. Chaos and terror ensue as they treck the mountainside and forest. The film depicts the times very well...and most the accents aren't that bad. But the thing i wasn't expecting was to see Cage actually put some effort into his role. Instead of woodenly walking through the film with terrible hair, Cage shows some true emotion and his hair ain't half bad. Cage is hit or miss, sometimes he's good (""Bad Lieutenant""), sometimes he's bad (""The Knowing""). I think Cage gets an A for effort. It's no his best acting but it's an improvement. Pearlman is great as the sidekick/friend and gets most of the good lines. The special effects are kinda lame and the film drags in certain spots, but overall ""Season of the witch"" is a decent thriller with some cheesy dialouge. This movie isn't bad as everyone makes it out to be. If you have low expectations like I did, you'll probably get a lot more enjoyment out of it.",/review/rw2838380/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Season of the Witch"" was a hotly anticipated release for me, even though the mid-January release date and the heap of poor reviews were suggesting I should give it a miss.

8 January 2011,DICK STEEL,5," A Nutshell Review: Season of the Witch
","Season of the Witch is getting ravaged by reviews as I write this. Is it that bad? I don't think so. Is it fantastic then? Well no. This is one of those sword and sandal fantasy films that tread the middle ground, having an interesting premise set up in a fantasy fellowship quest, only for the execution to be hovering around mediocre standards following a rote formula of introducing the problem, gathering the players, and have them encounter sequence after sequence of battle obstacles on the way to their objective.",/review/rw2838380/?ref_=tt_urv

The blame for it is put on a young woman, a girl, a self confessed witch.

18 January 2011,MaxBorg89,5," Where's the magic?
","Nicolas Cage. Magic. Blockbuster. A familiar combination, since Dominic Sena's Season of the Witch hits theaters only a few months after The Sorcerer's Apprentice (whose producer Jerry Bruckheimer, in the oddest of coincidences, worked with both star and director on Gone in 60 Seconds, eleven years back). While the latter was a by-numbers Disney effort (plenty of effects, a general lack of heart), Sena's latest work manages to also be quite a bit boring and occasionally ludicrous.",/review/rw2838380/?ref_=tt_urv

","The movie starts out in 1235 AD as 3 women accused of witchcraft are hung and drowned. The priest wants the bodies pulled up from the water so he can perform a ritual on them so they can't return from the dead. As always, resurrected witches have more power than when they were alive. This was all done to show you the ritual book. We jump ahead to 1332 AD with the savoy Nickolas Cage and Ron Perlman fighting in the crusades. After 7 years of rape, killing, pillage and plunder in the name of God's only son, Cage decides this is wrong and calls it quits. Cage and Perlman leave the crusades.

11 January 2011,Allswell007,," nonsensical and unsatisfying ending ruins the film
","Nic Cage is becoming the master of these kinds of movies. I'm not talking supernatural thrillers, I'm talking films that themematically start out a certain way and then flip in to the land of complete crap somewhere along the way. (The recent film ""Knowing"" springs to mind as an example) As the film progressed, I thought it was interesting, albeit far darker then I was expecting. By the end, the story spins off to freaky land and beyond. A movie you think could be directed towards exploring religious fanaticism or even faith itself instead spins in to a supernatural clusterflub of demons and stupidity. The ending and terrible direction absolutely ruins what was a pretty good first two-thirds of a movie. What makes this twice as bad is the fact that it's a ""journey"" film, meaning that everything that was set up leads to the resolution. In this case, the resolution is nonsensical and unsatisfying and negates just about anything good about the first two-thirds of its running time.",/review/rw2838380/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2011,misbegotten,7," A good film, marred by an ending that is over-reliant on special effects.
","Season of the Witch has a long and troubled history: production took place in November 2008 and it was originally supposed to hit cinema screens both in the UK and America in March 2010, but it was pulled from release, sat in limbo for several months, and seemed likely to bypass cinemas altogether and be quietly dumped straight onto DVD. Instead, additional footage was shot in September 2010 amidst rumours of extensive re-editing, and eventually a new release date of 7th January 2011 was announced. Initially intended as a dark, medieval horror film (rated R in America), it had been re-conceived - and was marketed as - a PG13-rated period fantasy/action-adventure.",/review/rw2838380/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2011,Bloodwank,5," Daft but bearable action fantasy nonsense
","Plopping out in early January, time honoured dumping ground of inferior product and draped in mediocre to poor reviews, Season of the Witch had quite a lot stacked against it. But for all this it ended up being one of the better films I've taken in on a whim, albeit far from any kind of classic or even especially good. Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman play disillusioned crusaders against witchcraft who get caught trying to escape their service and are recruited for a particularly tricky witch escorting mission. So we get an arduous mission through harsh medieval lands, trekking interspersed with action and capped with a nice blazing finale, and it should be a blast, should be a lot more entertaining than it is, but owing to lack of budget or balls (or some combination of both), it ends up being rather forgettable. The first noticeable problem is studied downplaying from Cage and Perlman, they have some measure of chemistry and a small smattering of good lines, but there's no fire. Both have potential for greatness, and both have a facility for the fantastical but for some reason neither of them chew too much scenery or puff with much in the way of rage so the film constantly feels like its missing its opportunities as well. The ethereal Claire Foy suffers similarly as the witch, she has a sweetly otherworldly way to her and lights up the screen, so its a shame she doesn't have more to do. As for Christopher Lee, well he's barely in it and just about anybody else would have been a worthy substitute. These problems aside Season of the Witch manages to be quite good fun for enough of the time that I overall enjoyed the experience. Its well enough shot to conjure an effectively macabre and misty mood at times, while Dominic Sena handles his directing duties with fair adeptitude, making for some exciting and sporadically stylish action. The pacing is a bit off but never truly dull and one or two low key spooks (the highlight being a rather neat opening) keep things interesting in between the few action set pieces, while the ending is very daft and rather good fun. If only it gelled together better, if only it realised whether it wanted to be a rousing medieval fantasy or a creepy horror and got a better handle on its tone, heck if only it wasn't aimed at a younger audience with its PG13 certificate so it could get away with a few actual shocks. Bah, it could have been a lot worse, 5/10 from me.",/review/rw2838380/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2012,blom0344,7," mediocre but a painless sit-through
","SOTW may be a mediocre film, but at least it manages to entertain. Nic Cage really makes an effort and Ron Perlman, well has never been better than in a middle ages setting. For all the historic inconsistencies they at least got the atmosphere about right. What makes it entertaining in the end is the sustained air of suspense while being on route. Not that it keeps you on the the edge of your seat, but it is decent enough. Travelling in the middle ages must have been a sort of Russian Roulette with little more than a sword to rely on. Unfortunately the last 20 minutes or so, the film goes over the top in a strange , pointless , exercise of CGI effects. The CGI itself is passable, but in contrast with the subtle air of discomfort during the voyage that makes up for the 2nd part of the film. As proclaimed, a painless sit-through , but could have been better with a subtle last act..",/review/rw2838380/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2011,TheLittleSongbird,3," Not quite as bad as I was led to believe, but it didn't work
","Judging from what I had heard and seen from many critics I was expecting a pile of horse poop. So while Season of the Witch was not as bad as it could've been, to me that didn't mean much. The costume and set design are great, the effects are good if too over-reliant in the last third of the film and Ron Perlman is a nice presence. So what spoilt it? ",/review/rw2838380/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2011,blacklist-1,8," An underrated movie. A very entertaining historical action film.
","The Next Three Days was an excellent drama thriller, which is the first film I saw this year on the big screen, followed by the sensational 127 Hours. I didn't think I could get three out of three for great films. I was wrong, though not in the same league as the last two, Season of the Witch continues the chain of a great year of films for 2011.",/review/rw2838380/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2011,Cinema_Love,9," Put your brain at OFF for godsake !!
","This isn't a historical or true story, it's a popcorn movie with action stars made to entertain you and on that side, it delivers. The movie open with a long series of battles with a few blood and gore. Then, Nic Cage and Ron Perlman, who are a team of soldiers in this movie, left their legion because they don't like what they are seeing and doing... killing childs and womens in the name of god. This is anything to them. They go on their own quest and end up being prisoners in a small village. And in that small village, they are almost all touched by the pest. Also a nice cameo by Christopher Lee here. Then, the two of them will go on a mission to escort a ''witch'' to see if she's really a witch in fact. And they will meet demons and other fictionnal creatures. It's a fun ride, 95 minutes seems to be quick, but in this one, there's so many things that happen all the time, you won't be bored. Nicolas Cage, Ron Perlman as well as Claire Foy as the Witch all impress me in this title ! It's not an Oscar worthy and not intended to be but it's pretty entertaining if you like the genre.",/review/rw2838380/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2011,PWNYCNY,7," Not a bad movie.
","This is not a bad movie. Neither is it great, but nevertheless it is watchable. It has a story. It has a plot. The acting is good. Nicholas Cage and Ron Perlman give credible performances. It is true that the story is far-fetched and challenges plausibility, but it deals with the supernatural, so that is only to be expected. Soemn of the special effects are cheesy, but so what? It's the story that counts and here the story is what drives this movie. Once again, there is a frail, young woman who causes so much havoc, yet at first glance she seems so harmless. This theme, of the helpless young girl as both victim and harpy, is continued in this movie, with good results. Far from being hokey, the story contains enough dramatic material to keep the audience's interest. There are those who may lambast this movie, dismiss it as just another Hollywood potboiler, and they may be right. Nevertheless, the movie does present a story and does not purport to be something that it is not, which affords the movie a modicum of integrity.",/review/rw2838380/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2011,paperback_wizard,7," Season of the Witch: Spellbinding
","""Season of the Witch"" is a genuinely suspenseful and thrilling start to  the 2011 movie year. With a cast comprised of screen veterans and  relative newcomers, this period piece about witchcraft and true  nobility will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.  After a gripping prologue which establishes that witches do, in fact,  exist and can be quite deadly, the movie dives straight into the heart  of the Crusades in the mid-14th Century, the stage for some of the  bloodiest and most brutal battles in history; and also some of the  greatest abuses of authority by the Christian church. Two knights,  Behmen and Felson, played by Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman, enter the  wars eager to fight at each other's side. However, as the horrors of  war set in, the two become convinced that it would be better to desert  and risk execution than continue the savage pursuit. It's a bit of a  cliché, but director Dominic Sena handles it very well.  The pair are eventually captured and brought to justice. However, the  town in which they are arrested lies in the middle of a plague-stricken  region. Even the local Cardinal, played by Christopher Lee, has fallen  ill. He promises the knights they will be pardoned if they agree to  help lift the curse he believes is the cause of the plague: a young  woman accused of witchcraft must be taken to a monastery where certain  rites must be performed that would end the curse. The girl, of course,  would be executed.  The errant knights have no desire to aid the church that has been the  cause of so much suffering, but Behmen believes the girl's chances of a  fair trial are much higher if they travel with her. It is not long  before the small band of travelers encounters trouble, though, and even  Behmen cannot ignore the likelihood that the girl is behind it all. As  the young priest who accompanies them warns him, the girl will try to  sow doubt and dissension in the minds of whomever comes close enough to  hear her speak. Soon, it becomes clear that even traveling with her  places each of their lives in danger.  ""Season"" hovers on the edge of clicheness fairly often. There are a few  moments that could have gone either way, including the ""buddy"" dynamic  between Behmen and Felson and the inclusion of Kay, the young altar boy  who accompanies them hoping to become a knight like his father was.  These moments, however, lend a much-needed lightheartedness to a movie  that keeps your heart pounding almost nonstop, and the caliber of the  acting and directing keep it from going over the edge.  The balance of seasoned and up-and-coming actors also works well in  ""Season"". Claire Foy, in particular, is a delight to watch as she runs  the gamut of roles from simple peasant and hapless victim to shrewd  manipulator and evil menace. Cage and Perlman seem a touch out of place  at times in medieval Europe, but as friends willing to fight together  even in the face of Hell, they fit perfectly. It's not the standard  winter movie fare, perhaps, but it's definitely spellbinding.  )",/review/rw2838380/?ref_=tt_urv
