27 April 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Fun Show!
",I really didn't know what to expect from Upload and never really planned on watching it until I read all the great reviews and thought I'd give it a chance. I'm so glad that I did because it's really good! It's just a fun show that will keep you entertained throughout. I'm glad they renewed it for more seasons. I absolutely recommend that you give it a chance because you will not be disappointed!,/review/rw5695465/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2022,and_shove_it_up_your_butt,7," Seasons are way too short
",7 episodes this time? Seriously? I realize this is a 1st World Problem but either make the episodes 45 minutes to an hour long or give us more of them.,/review/rw5695465/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Pretty Good!
","I really didn't know what to expect from Upload and never really planned on watching it until I read all the great reviews and thought I'd give it a chance. I'm so glad that I did because it's really good! It's just a fun show that will keep you entertained throughout. It's a very smart, charming series that will make you laugh several times per episode. It's a love story and murder mystery all rolled into one show. It was created by Greg Daniels (The Office, Parks and Recreation, etc) so he knows how to make a great show. I'm glad they renewed it for more seasons. I absolutely recommend that you give it a chance because you will not be disappointed!",/review/rw5695465/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2020,r3volution11,8," Great mix of romantic drama and off the wall comedy
","This is a fun show with great characters that you love more and more with each episode. Robbie Amell and Andy Allo, I believe in their first starring roles in a TV series, have great chemistry together. You cheer for things to go well and get upset when they don't. And all the side characters really add to this, Idiocracy-like, future world.",/review/rw5695465/?ref_=tt_urv

4 May 2020,dollydiabolique,8," Easy to watch and more than meets the eye
","This is a really interesting series. What seems like it's a bit of a vacuous rom-com, actually has an undercurrent with real substance and excellent acting. I kept watching through the early episodes, as it hints that there's a bit more going on, and I am glad I did as I was satisfied by the end. It's an easy to watch but clever series.",/review/rw5695465/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2020,scott-menter,9," Surprisingly thoughtful; even more surprisingly, actually funny
","Upload is an imaginative look at a hyper-consumerized near future in which even death can be avoided - for a price. It would have been easy to play this scenario for cheap laughs - and sure, there are some - but Upload goes further, exploring relationships, ethical boundaries, and most of all, the blind spots in the mirror we hold up to ourselves.",/review/rw5695465/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2022,avocadosrbad,4," Season 1 great! Season 2 meh.
","Loved season 1 and the concept. Then it got too preachy in the second season. I love Johnson and Bigley together, the are adorable. But the weird Ludd plot line sucked and the election swaying? For who? 1% are on both sides? How does this plot line make sense. Anyhow, it went off the rails and went in a weird direction, Nora's character was unbearable in season 2, she just assumes the worst of Nathan every time. Matteo is a creepy terrorist and adds nothing but cringe to every scene. I actually starting liking Ingrid more, shes actually improving, while the ""heroes"" are simultaneously getting worse. Im bummed because I had been waiting for season 2 and it was disappointing. Some characters just faded away, no explanation. Meh.",/review/rw5695465/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2020,drjgardner,10," Brilliant sci-fi writing
","The show is billed as a comedy but maybe it's better described as a satire. There aren't any belly laughs and the most you can get is a snicker. But boy oh boy a few minutes don't go by when you don't think ""That's brilliant."" This is a soon to happen future and it's done so well. Bravo to the writers.",/review/rw5695465/?ref_=tt_urv

9 July 2022,Nathan4,5," Season 2 fell off a cliff
","Season one felt new and fresh and had depth. SUPER WEIRD, but fun and lighthearted with some mystery mixed in. Season 1 = a solid 7/10.",/review/rw5695465/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2020,Angerforz,8," ""You couldn't have done a better job, Nathan"".
","This show has a remarkably interesting premise, such a light hearted and feel good comedy, it's very intriguing and interestingly different. Loved the show from the start, it really made me feel for the characters and gave them a lot of sentimental value, in such a short period of time, such a good sci-fi/romance/comedy show. Even tho it feels lighthearted with lots of comedy and romance, yet its very deep and philosophical, and the more you sink in and think about what they are talking about and the whole situation itself between the real world and the ""Upload"" world the more deep it becomes, just brilliant.",/review/rw5695465/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2020,IonicBreezeMachine,10," High concept sci-fi satire has heart, humor, and mystery
","Upload is easily one of the best surprises this year. Taking place in the future, the series is set in a world in which people can have their consciousness scanned and uploaded to a VR afterlife where they become what the world calls Uploads. The premise is certainly an out there one, but despite being a comedy there is a good amount of thought into how the economics and society work with this type of technology and the businesses that manage it. The series follows Nathan Brown a newly deceased computer programmer played with great charisma and comedic timing by Robbie Amell. Nathan interacts with a whole host of memorable characters such as Angel(the afterlife's name for customer service reps) Nora Anthony, fellow deceased Luke, a brash abrasive Iran War veteran who scores some of the biggest laughs, and Allegra Edwards as Ingrid, Nathan's still living girlfriend who manages his permissions and purchases in his afterlife(yes, the afterlife has in-app purchases). Interspersed with all the humor and satire is also a compelling mystery where we find that Nathan's death may have had a helping hand. Upload plays like the best parts of The Good Place and The Truman Show viewed through the lens of Phillip K. Dick's paranoid thrillers. If you love sci-fi, comedy, and just plain good television, give this a watch.",/review/rw5695465/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2020,DKosty123,8," Sci-Fi Comedy Clever Entertaining 2000 3000
",Is it possible that there will be a virtual world where as long as your character is preserved electronically your soul does not die and continues to live and interact socially and physically with the real world? That's a long question and this series sort of creates this type of thing. In a way it's a quirky look at the future where the real world gets virtual add on.,/review/rw5695465/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2022,ultra-taya,7," Entertaining first season but disappointing second
","I really enjoyed the first season. It was fresh, entertaining and funny. I would not describe it as comedy but neither as drama. Dramedy also doesn't fit as description. It shows a serious story in a less serious way. Most of the characters are enjoyable. The concept of being uploaded to a virtual world after the death is very interesting. So it is fun to follow Nathan's story. All in all the first season is really good, but the second is disappointing. They couldn't catch up the level of the first season, they tried to move the story into another direction but didn't really succeed. I would rather prefer to watch the first season's story continuing. 8 stars for the first season and 5 for the second.",/review/rw5695465/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2020,mdbourke-282-899973,8," ""Condom size disupte aisle 4""
","So, was interested in this show when I saw the trailer, and anticipated it would be more of a straight comedy. Initially I thought it would be a carbon copy of The Good Place, which it sort of is, sort of!?!",/review/rw5695465/?ref_=tt_urv

12 March 2022,brucethomson-47872,3," Series 1 OK, 2 is off to a very bad start
","If you worked your way through series 1 this was above average. Series 2 has gone very wrong, sadly. I can't see any point going back to even see part 1.",/review/rw5695465/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2022,csos,5," First series an 8 - second a 3
",Loved the first series but the second just couldn't grab my attention. The storyline went off somewhere else and didn't keep me interested any more. Too many wasted moments by filling in bits and pieces that had nothing to do with forwarding the story. Gave up halfway through episode 3 because I didn't care where it went or what happened next.,/review/rw5695465/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2020,aidanratesmovies,8," Season 1 Review- Funny, heartfelt, and entertaining- but often uneven
","An often refreshing and very entertaining new show- Upload has its fair share of mishaps and problems (especially in its final episode), but all together proves to be a pretty enjoyable time. Upload is written and created by The Office and Parks and Recreation creator Greg Daniels, and I am pleased to say that the show is very different from both of those shows. Going into the show, I found something very unique and different, full of refreshingly new ideas and concepts, and a very provocative world taken place in the future. Though Daniel's previous works are far different than this one, the humor is just as brilliantly executed and satire like as before, and even is able to stick to a strong emotional and romantic component throughout its 10 episode run so far. As far as the flaws go with the show, there are several inconsistencies and forgotten plot points, characters, ideas, and devices that are kinda swept away by the shows final episodes. The way it plays out and forgets about things that it made clear to be important previously, just makes the show seem messier than it is, and is a bit annoying to watch at times. The acting is pretty good, with Robbie Amell and Andy Allo stealing the spotlight significantly throughout, as well as some good performances from Kevin Bigley and Zainab Johnson. The character of Lucy throughout the show seems more of a plot device than an actual character, and her whole existent in the show just seems to create conflict between the shows two main stars, which can prove to be frustrating and awfully predictable at times. Her character is also written extremely over the top, and is meant to be a jerk, but seems deeply artificial in being so. My biggest problem with the show in total is its final episode, which to my surprise a lot of fellow users on IMDb rated quite highly. The final episode doesn't seem like much of a finale, and in fact just seems like one huge plot sequence to keep viewers interested in the show for the next season. It feels incredibly vapid, very frustrating to sit through, and extremely problematic, with each decision made by the characters and the writers alike feeling like the wrong decision over and over again. It's tone shifts too briskly, and it's ideas seem to mottled and all too uneven to truly take the effect that they are supposed to. In the end, Upload left me disappointed with a lackluster finale, but for the most part, it is consistently entertaining, very funny, and surprisingly well acted. It's writing can be a bit problematic at times, with some things being left in the dust, but for its strongest parts, Upload is more than a decent watch that will have you laughing, and feeling extremely heartfelt for the characters involved. I'm hoping to see more, even with the predictable and obviously disappointing excuse of a finale, and hope that the show will be able to manage its footing just a little better during its next season.

6 May 2020,rmmil,3," Too silly to be compelling
","I'm not sure why this series is getting such high praise? I feel like Amazon Prime originals get unfairly overhyped in the same way Netflix stuff is sometimes unfairly ripped.

5 May 2020,kjproulx,9," A Funny, Engaging, and Thought-Provoking Series
","It's been a while since I've come across a new television show that felt as unique as Upload. With all of the content out there these days, it's hard to find something that's incredibly original, and while this series may borrow elements of things you've seen before, I found it to be very fresh. Amazon Studios, between feature films and television series', has been knocking it out of the park for years now and I believe this series deserves some recognition as one of their best. Here's why I believe the first season of Upload is worth your time.",/review/rw5695465/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,cureuser,7," 7 episodes is not a full season !
","I really like this show but streaming services seem incapable to create longer seasons which is a real turn off especially for shows with short episodes. I remember Friends from college on Netflix , 30 minutes episodes and only 8 of them. It just does not work for sitcom style comedy shows. Friends had 24 episodes ! I think this low episode count per season strategy should be reconsidered.",/review/rw5695465/?ref_=tt_urv
