7 July 2000,Figaro-8,," The most unique and original TV series ever produced--there has never been anything like it, and there never will be.
","I have just one question:  How can Disney Television Animation produce such a wonderful show as ""Gargoyles"" for a couple of seasons and then go back to being Disney Television Animation?  I simply cannot understand it, and if anyone has any thoughts, PLEASE share them with me!  This show was a breath of fresh air on every level.  If this wasn't a groundbreaking show, it certainly raised the bar sky high.",/review/rw5303735/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2003,thrix,," BEST animated series ever (?)
","Really, has there been anyone better? I need to see that! It's almost unreal that Disney produced a series like this; mythology, technology, action, drama, strong characters, great voice acting, shakespeare refereces, breathtaking environment and a TIGHT story with no flaws or holes- all links together. Unfortunately the series has never aired in Sweden, at least not yet, so the audience here (both young and old :) has not experienced it... I'm glad I did and in english.",/review/rw5303735/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 1999,Aerie-2,," Awesome!!
","Having lived in the New York metropolitan area my entire life, Gargoyles was even more fun to watch since many of the landmarkings were places I've hung out at) The animation in itself is mindblowing.  The sights and sounds of the show are true to life of Manhattan, even if you've never been there, it makes you feel like you're there.",/review/rw5303735/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2000,Blinking_Fish,," Not the Disney mold we're used to.
","Gargoyles was very different from the Disney stuff we're used to and that was a good thing.  Don't get me wrong I have nothing against Disney but I do like it when a cartoon goes into a dramatic plot, has lots of character development, and where when one thing happens in an episode it can affect what happens in later episodes.  I actually didn't know that this was a Disney show until I saw it on a cover of Disney Magazine.  Most of the episodes in Gargoyles were well thought out, most of the characters have back-stories to them and there was historical accuracy in many flashbacks being truth or popular legendary.  Unfortunately Gargoyles didn't have a very long run and almost as soon as it ended it was pulled from most networks and had retreated to channels Disney owned.  But if you ever get the chance to see Gargoyles on TV take it.",/review/rw5303735/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2000,Op_Prime,," What a legacy
","Gargoyles was a cartoon series for kids, but it looked like something else. While the kids watched it, it looked like something adults would get. Unlike many cartoons, this show was serious. It played on more dramatic themes and was filled with action, unlike other cartoons that were filled with pointless (yet funny) violence. This was truly one of Disney's finer animated series.",/review/rw5303735/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," A real contender for the best animated show ever
","I cannot begin to detail how phenomenal this show is. I have seen plenty of exceptional animated shows, and some of them are very underrated, but Gargoyles has it all, mystery, complexity, depth, adventure and suspense, and one of those rarities where there is not a bad episode.",/review/rw5303735/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 1999,argyle,," Brilliant show, not just for kids
","Gargoyles is the only kids' show I've ever seen that contained this much continuity, introducing the concept that actions have consequences that can last more than 30 minutes.  There were plot elements introduced in the first few episodes that became important as much as two full years later.  You had to pay attention to this one.",/review/rw5303735/?ref_=tt_urv

15 December 2004,lumpmoose,10," Disney TV at its Best
","""Gargoyles"" was a series released during the ""Disney Afternoon"" block of the mid-nineties. What makes it so unique is that it's still the only dramatic animated series Disney TV has ever produced. It stunned people at the time with its tragic plots, realistic weapons, and clear consequences to characters' actions. It's definitely not for young children (the Y7 rating is a good guideline), but don't think it's just another brainless afternoon shoot-'em-up designed to sell action figures. The backbone of this saga is what all timeless fiction must contain: plot and character development. The writing is taut, the acting fantastic, and the animation beautiful, but they are all mere servants to the story, which stays interesting and moderately serialized throughout the entire series (just the first season has been released on DVD, 13 of 65 episodes).",/review/rw5303735/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2010,Rectangular_businessman,10," Excellent series
","""Gargoyles"" is one of the best cartoons (If not the best) produced by the Walt Disney company. This show wasn't like any other of the cartoons made by Disney before, being darker and targeted to a more mature audience than shows like ""DuckTales"" ""Drakwing Duck"" (Which are pretty good shows, by the way) ""Gargoyles"" was a serious, interesting action animated series, in the same line than the animated series of ""Batman"" made by Bruce Timm, being one of the best examples of the genre with intelligent, very well written stories, great animation, and the best of all, fascinating and realistic characters.

7 May 1999,Catalyst-4,," The best animated series ever!
","The plot of Gargoyles is like a well paved street: no holes.  The creators took exceptional care to ensure a growing and continuing plot line that involved all of the characters.  The idea was very innovative and inspiring. It involved a clan of Gargoyles, stone by day/flesh by night, that were betrayed by humans in 994.  They were frozen in stone by a magic curse for a millenium until a multi-billionaire broke the curse.  They awoke to a new world in a foreign land completely dominated by humans that were unaware of their existence.  After befriending a courageous police officer, Elisa Maza, and being betrayed by the man that broke their curse and a fellow clan member, they triumphed over their enemies and became Manhattan's guardian angels.  The rest of the series continued to be interesting. Incorporating Arthurian legends and mythological deities, the show always took fictional constructs and shaped them into tougher versions that were really cool. Most impressive, Gargoyles included Shakespearean characters, with a twist. Macbeth had been alive for over 900 years, and had a grudge for gargoyles. A Midsummer Night's Dream's Oberon and Titania were powerful beings that possessed powerful, and often destructive magic.  With a unique blend of villains and allies, and villains that became allies, the plot of Gargoyles was ever changing and continuous.  As for action scenes, I have never seen better ones.  Scenes of epic sword fights, aerial combat, and hand-to-hand fighting made the fight scenes exceptional.  I would like to describe the action better, but I find it hard to express in words how intense, creative, and simply awesome the scenes really are.  Ultimately, Gargoyles is the greatest animated series I have ever seen, and I advise any action lover to see it.  Whether you like action, plot line, creativity, or even Shakespeare, you will find all of that in Gargoyles: The Best Animated Series Ever!",/review/rw5303735/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 1999,Dave-543,," Nothing can compare to Gargoyles. Ever.
","Quite simply, Gargoyles was wonderful. No other word could possibly describe it. A great plot that continued to grow; characters that matured, lost innocence, and grew up; simply beautiful animation, even better acting on the part of the voice actors; and, most important of all, an absolutely original idea. There will never be another one like Gargoyles, ever. There can be no dispute. I don't think I will ever run out of praise for Gargoyles, nor have anything but. Everything about it was pure genius on the part of the shows creator Greg Weisman. In fact, to this day, I am certain that Gargoyles do exist because of the sheer realness of the show. And believe me, Gargoyles was very real. People died, trust was betrayed, central characters were changed forever by events in the story. One example of this is the vengeful agenda of the main ""bad guy"" (quotes are around the term ""bad guy"" because in Gargoyles, no one was truly evil, with the possible exception of the non-Fox members of The Pack.) Demona. The former love of Goliath, the leader of the clan of gargoyles that forms most of the central characters, Demona is an immortal gargoyle who was deeply hurt when her entire clan, save Goliath and his five friends, were smashed during their daytime sleep, during which they are stone statues. Betrayed, hurt, and angry, Demona has dedicated her life to the destruction of humanity. This is but one example of how the characters were developed and changed by events in the entire chronology of the series. Gargoyles is no longer on TV anymore. It could not compete commercially with Power Rangers, may they endure a thousand torments, and had to be cancelled. But, it's legacy will always live on in the hearts of those of us whose lives were touched by it and who will always keep a special place in  our hearts for it. However, I may have mispoken myself. Gargoyles may be not be on TV any longer, but, they still thrive in the form of fan fiction. They are great stories, and they are written in such a way that you do not have to have seen the entire series to fully understand what is going on, although it helps slightly. And, if you wish to see Gargoyles in it's televised form, some of the very early episodes can be found in any video store in the cartoon section. Watch it. Trust me, you will never be the same once you've looked through the eyes of a gargoyle.",/review/rw5303735/?ref_=tt_urv

15 April 2004,mthakore,10," Gargoyles is an amazing series!
","I started out a nine-year old watching this show. I am now eighteen years old and I still love it. This show had a lot of things that cartoons today don't have. I mean morals, great animation, great story ( most important of all), and great characters. What more could you want? Every one of the characters embodied someone you could look up to. This is especially true for Goliath. He always stuck with what was best for everybody. Even when the whole clan was destroyed, he searched out the enemy to save those that were kidnapped. That is the true measure by which humanity should be measured, doing the right thing. I kind of feel sorry for kids today because cartoons today stink for the most part. I only hope the live action movie is as good as the show was. I can't wait!",/review/rw5303735/?ref_=tt_urv

10 May 2006,cirdon,10," Not your ordinary ""cartoon""
","The show is what many consider Disney's greatest. The irony of this is that the Disney Company had little say in what went on with the show.

23 April 2020,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,9," Disney knew that Batman was making things challenging. And this show worked.
","Gargoyles is essentially Disney's answer to Bruce Timm's Batman: The Animated Series. Now I'm certain someone's compared this to Batman on IMDB already (at least it's been compared to it elsewhere) and I don't want to take ANY credit for that comparison, but I will still sing praises for this show because it became one of TV's few original superhero offerings that never derived itself from a comic book or pre-existing property. Gargoyles was equal parts dramatically engaging, funny and shocking when it decided to go there. And best of all it didn't treat the kiddies in condescending ways: it didn't simplify the complexities of the drama between Goliath and company. It was a dramatic family show as accessible and as well-realised as Batman; it also had equal respect for its audience.",/review/rw5303735/?ref_=tt_urv

13 June 2004,SonicStuart,," Very Great Cartoon series!
","Gargoyles, I think is another clever cartoon action series! Gargoyles is a series about these creatures that existed as stone in the day, but become flesh and blood at night. One Scottish clan made an alliance with humans to help protect a castle by night if the humans would protect their stone forms by day. The uneasy alliance was shattered when human prejudice provoked a betrayal that allowed the castle to be sacked and most of the resident clan destroyed, leaving only six adult survivors and a rookery of unhatched eggs. A further misunderstanding during the Clan's retaliation on the invaders and rescue of their hostages left the clan frozen in stone by a magic spell that would only be broken when the ""Castle rises above the Clouds."" For a thousand years, the castle laid abandoned and the clan condemned by this curse. In 1994, a wealthy multi-billionaire named David Xanatos, bought the castle and transported the whole structure to Manhattan where he placed it on top of the Eyrie building which he owned. It is high enough to be above the clouds, thus the conditions of the spell were met and the Gargoyles were revived. Now, this clan must adjust to this new age and gain friends like Detective Elisa Masa who reveals that Xantoses revived them to exploit them for his unscrupulous ends. This show premiered on the Disney Afternoon for the first 2 seasons and then it was put on ABC Saturday Mornings for the 3rd season and the 3rd season was broadcast under a new name called Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles.",/review/rw5303735/?ref_=tt_urv
