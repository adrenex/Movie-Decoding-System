26 July 2020,fernandoschiavi,9," Technically and emotionally, Mission: Impossible: Fallout is the first major representative of action genre
","It was from Mission: Impossible 3 (2006) that the franchise began to strike a balance between pace (faster than the first) and history (more elaborate than the previous one). In addition, JJ Abrams' debut as a director on the big screen introduced two important secondary characters, Julia (Michelle Monaghan) and Benji (Simon Pegg) - he established himself as the second most frequent supporting actor, second only to Luther (Ving Rhames), the single that appears in all the films together with Ethan. After the well-executed Ghost Protocol (2011), commanded by Brad Bird, the series gained a very interesting touch with the arrival of Christopher McQuarrie. As a screenwriter, he smartly took advantage of the mention of the Union at the end of the previous film to develop the Rogue Nation plot (2015), which brought Ethan, Luther and Benji chasing this terrorist organization, headed by Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), and at the same time, dealing with the risk of dissolution of the IMF as a result of the Ghost Protocol events - this created a hitherto unprecedented sense of continuity between the two films.",/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Best Mission Impossible movie ever!
","Thrilling from start to finish with intrigue, action and romance crackling throughout, this is the new standard in non-superhero action films. Add to that Tom Cruise doing his own crazy stunts and it is indisputable that Mission: Impossible is better than Bond, better than Bourne.",/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2022,melwinbauer,9," An action masterpiece
","""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" is the sixth entry of the ""Mission: Impossible"" series and the best entry thus far. ""Fallout"" is a masterpiece. It continues the tradition of the series, where it gets better with each film. This one improves on the older films in every aspect. It has pretty much everything: the action, the stunts, the visuals, the twists. It's a thrilling experience where the viewer is kept on their toes at all times.",/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2020,sauravjoshi85,9," The best movie of the franchise!! A must watch.
","Mission: Impossible - Fallout is an action movie movie directed by Christopher McQuarrie and stars Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Sean Harris, Vanessa Kirby, Angela Bassett and Alec Baldwin with a extended cameo by Michelle Monaghan.",/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2021,educallejero,9," The best of the franchise
","After a good, but not great start in the franchise, McQuarrie creates the best combination of the good that came before him, with a better script that even MI-I, the unstoppable action of MI-3, good humor without going over the top contrary to MI-4, and those romantic touches that help the movie to slow down and feel a bit for the characters.",/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2020,singhlall,8," Does what it says on the tin.
","Entertaining action flick worthy of the franchise. Tom cruise still cuts the mustard and Henry Cavill is a strong character in a pretty impressive cast. All the usual stunts, masks and stunt sequences you would expect.",/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2021,SPZMaxinema,10," The best action movie of the decade!
","Tom Cruise stuns with what he can do at his age. His desire to please all with his action stunts and skills is unparalleled. A good villain, top class directing, unexpected twists, and even humor on the side makes this one a must-see! Did I mention the insane action enough??",/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2022,wackoreviews,9," One of the best action movies out there
","Inevitably, undeniably, indisputably one of THE BEST spy movies out there.",/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2019,Insane_Man,8," In top 3 most ACTION films ever!
",The best in MI. The best in the past several years.,/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2022,grakky,10," Great flick!
","I thought I had this on my shelf but it disappeared or I hallucinated having it:)
Regardless, this is yet another great Mission Impossible story.",/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2021,welhof1,8," Best MI yet
",They really ramped up the intensity in this one and they did good. These action scenes are just so unbelievable and awesome. I'm a reserved guy and this movie almost had me yelling at my tv. Heart pounding fun.,/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2020,sidneyleeberthier,8," Strongest instalment in the franchise
","This is the strongest instalment in the franchise. The reason for this? It's the first M:I film to become self-aware, taking into account Hunt/Cruise's penchant for dangerous stunts, as well as his advancing age. What we get is a more personal story about the protagonist's 'killer' job, his allies and his life.",/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2020,williammosedale,8," An amazing action movie
",The story is great and never confusing and the cinematatography is so beautiful and rich in colours and the ending is thriling and suspensfull.I havent seen any other MI films but this film certainly makes me want to see more of then,/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2020,shourya-23641,10," MASTERPEICE
",Just another masterpeice of TOM CRUISE and every character of the M.I series.Every action scene in the movie is out of this world and I would say that the movie is really ahead of this time.,/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2018,Prashast_Singh,10," And the award for the best action movie goes to...
","Let's get straight to the point: MISSION IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT justifies the need to watch action movies on the big screen. Every single action scene works, particularly the final one. Tom Cruise never disappoints when it comes to fighting, chasing and of course, running! He officially killed it in this movie!",/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2018,iamianiman,9," Your Mission... Should You Choose to Accept It... is to Read this Review and See Mission Impossible 6: Fallout in Theaters Now Now Now!!!
","As we all know, this is the sixth instalment of the franchise. Supposedly by this time, the series already started long to drag their wear and tear tires here and about, so within so without, sucking every preposterous and ridiculous ideas they can think of. However, Mission Impossible franchise has been one of the few to deny that statement, as the impossible becomes possible, as it suggests that statement is merely a myth, as the ideas never entirely run out, as the stunts are afresh and eye-catching but can this new instalment keep up with the others (putting aside the second one as if it never happens because the majority of us can agree it's the worst) or will it have a serious fallout?",/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2021,lareval,10," Awesome!
","Not just the best Mission Impossible (followed closely by the first one and 'Rogue Nation'), but one of the best action movies of the last years. Perfect pacing, excellent direction and great performances elevate the movie from start to finish.",/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2018,neil-476,9," Great escapist action nonsense
","After Machiavellian baddie Solomon Lane is captured in the previous movie, a group called The Apostles moves into the terrorist vacuum. The IMF screws up and three plutonium cores come into The Apostles hands. Recovering them might be tricky, especially as they are forced to work with an unsubtle CIA enforcer.",/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2018,TheBigSick,," Disappointing
","Not sure if the critics are bought or not, but surely this is mostly overrated. The plot is much contrived and coincidental. Based on a cliched ""saving-the-world"" story, most of the scenes are not realistically set. Hunt is just like a Superman or something. There is no tension or thrill, because you know everything will be fine and there will be another cash grab sequel.",/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2020,brunovanael,7," Great over the top action
","Great action movie as most of them in this series. Over the top, but it's not mission almost impossible. Just don't expect a very gullible script.",/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2018,Jared_Andrews,9," Best Action Movie of the Year
","'Mission: Impossible - Fallout' burst onto the scene this weekend, rejuvenating what had been a mostly baron summer of action-blockbusters. Sure, we had 'Equalizer 2' and 'Skyscraper,' but those were both meh. Thankfully, this film is far better than meh. Actually, it's excellent. ",/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2019,claudio_carvalho,7," Great Action Film
","""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" is maybe the best the best film of this franchise. The non-stop action story is engaging and funny, there are good plot points and it is worthwhile watching. The unbearable 56 year-old Tom Cruise convinces in the role of Ethan Hunt. My vote is seven.",/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2018,pranayjalvi,9," Another fast paced and thrilling action continuing the franchise
","Ageless, riveting and seemingly unstoppable, Tom Cruise remains a force of nature in this Mission: Impossible franchise. The sixth film in the series is among the most outstanding, delivering a near-exhausting amount of fantabulous action sequences paired with deft character drama and the requisite life-or-death stakes. At nearly two-and-a-half hours, Fallout has ambitions as vast as its running time. McQuarrie weaves elements of tragedy and political commentary into action packed crime thriller.",/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2018,Brandon_Walker_Robinson,8," Cruise and McQuarrie return with fresh grit and excellence that leaves me wanting more from the duo
","Fallout feels like a direct sequel to Rogue Nation, even though it doesn't take place immediately after in the timeline (based on some dialogue I believe it to be two years later). But a lot of things remained consistent: we finally kept a director around (I'll get to that later) and many of the characters have returned, including one Solomon Lane (played by Sean Harris) with more villainy than ever before. In the past, we would cruise through team members such as Maggie Q, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Paula Patton, and heck even Jeremy Renner who was not in this flick... but we have grown into others like Ving Rhames (whose character wasn't just there to look cool and throw in some one-liners, but rather to shed some actual emotional weight), Simon Pegg (who has finally earned my respect ""in the field"" where I feel he now officially belongs), flashes of Michelle Monaghan (the Jules factor!) and newcomers Alec Baldwin (underused again) and Rebecca Ferguson (dayum is all I have to say). Yes, they threw in some new characters in this film... I'd say one too many for me to keep track of... but they didn't interfere too much with the chemistry already in place with the other actors/actresses surrounding Tom Cruise and the bigger picture. I'm a bit iffy on Henry Cavill's character still, as he felt a bit out of place from the franchise we've been accustomed to, but he did work in this film as did his mustache. Even still, I think this movie demands a re-watch on my end to understand all of the character motivations again, particularly three of them. ",/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2020,saikatsamanta,8," Setting a New Bar in the Genre...
","Director: How much Jaw-dropping action sequences do you need?
Cruise: Yes...
In Every Movie of this franchise, they keep on raising the bar as far as Action films go. What makes these films stand out amongst a plethora of CGI, Green Screen infested genre of films is the Vision to deliver something unique with meticulously built setups, long wide shots of nervewracking moments & Tom Cruise's frightening intent of keeping it as real as possible. The Hand to Hand Combat, Chase scenes on Foot, On Bike, on Helicopters; all of those were Top notch. The story is very similar to previous films so nothing new there. But it has the right amount of emotion & earnest perfromances to make it one of the Best Action Movies we have seen for a while.",/review/rw6395429/?ref_=tt_urv
