30 January 2002,snake77,8," Outstanding, realistic crime film
","This is a really good film, one of the most realistic films about drugs and the criminal underworld I've ever seen. The film examines a week in the life of a mid-level drug dealer on the streets of Copenhagen and pulls no punches.  Kim Bodina gives a great, nuanced performance as Frank, the dealer and main character.  He captures perfectly the snaky charisma, emotional detachment and nihilism of a street dealer.  Frank is essentially a sociopath, turning on the charm when it suits him and turning a blind eye on the people in his life when they can't be of any use to him.  Especially effective is the portrayal of Frank's relationship with Vic, the high priced call girl he obviously cares about but can't bring himself to get physical with because of his emotional coldness.  Frank blames this dilemma on her work, suggesting he can't touch her because she's a whore.  However it's Vic he always turns to when things go bad.",/review/rw5674516/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2007,bob the moo,," Gritty and engaging crime drama
","Frank is a drug dealer moving heroin between the level above him and his customer base. When he is asked to get 200 grams of dope in less than 24 hours he balks but when he is offered 700 on the gram he tries to pull it together. Already 50,000 in debt to local gangster Milo, Frank takes a risk and gets the drugs on credit ahead of a good sale. However when the sale goes down the police are tipped off and the only thing saving Frank from jail is his quick wits to dive into the lake and destroy the evidence against him. Released by the police within hours, Frank knows his problems are only beginning as he now owes even more money to Milo  a man not known for his patience.",/review/rw5674516/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2002,raymond-15,8," Brilliant drama
","With the police about to spring, the buying, selling and dealing in drugs (cocaine and the like) is an extremely dangerous business. Profits can be enormous...providing of course that the buyers don't lag in their payments and that the dealer is sure of the quality of the drugs he has on offer...it must be the genuine article, not talcum or bicarbonate of soda!",/review/rw5674516/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie blew me and my friends away 10 years ago. This rock steady and realistic tale about real criminals, not the typical American teen age- BS. These people are real, that's as simple as it gets. The docu-kind of outlook fits this movie perfect.",/review/rw5674516/?ref_=tt_urv

7 July 2000,anne-johnorr,8," comments by John Orr, Edinurgh Scotland
","Pusher is a visceral low-budget movie set on the streets of Copenhagen. Though its director Nicholas Winding Refn is not a part of Dogme 95 the film uses many of the Dogme maxims to better effect. The plot is deceptively simple. Frank (Kim Bodnia)is double-crossed on a deal and has a couple of days to make good the covering loan to a sadistic Balkan gangster. The film's speed rhythms convey the nightmare of time running out, luck running out, and life, shot with hand-held camera in natural light going around in circles until suddenly damnation beckons. Tougher than Tarantino or Trainspotting, it pulls no punches and its running gags fail to draw the sting. One of the great city films of the 1990s.",/review/rw5674516/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 1999,Mudflap,9," WoW - One of the best movies I've ever seen!
","I just don't know what to say about this film: I just saw it and I feel so ignorant - I don't know who the director is, I don't know who the cast members are, but man-o-man I'm going to find out!  What a compelling, gripping story!  In this particular case I feel that a few of of us underground movie geeks knowing and loving this film just isn't enough.  I feel like I want to run out and tell the world - in brief, I haven't been this excited about a film in a long, long time!",/review/rw5674516/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2006,UlrikSander,10," Exceptional debut-movie by Nicolas Winding Refn.
","In the 1990's a new era in the history of Danish cinema began with movies such as NATTEVAGTEN, DE STØRSTE HELTE, PORTLAND and most importantly PUSHER. Nicolas Winding Refn was only 26 years old when he co-wrote/directed this art-house masterpiece debut. I first saw this gem when I was 12 years old. I remember being immediately stunned. It had the stylishness and brutality of Martin Scorsese's GOODFELLAS or MEAN STREETS, the realism and hand-held camera-style of John Cassevettes' THE KILLING OF A Chinese BOOKIE and the cool pop-culture referential dialog of Quentin Tarantino's PULP FICTION, although it easily exceeds being just another post-modernistic Tarantino rip-off. It portrays the milieu and characters in such a realistic and dramatic way that it feels voyeuristic. PUSHER is a docu-drama in the truest sense of the word.",/review/rw5674516/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2020,XxEthanHuntxX,9," Pusher - 90
","The Danish guys made many good films during the 90's. One of them was Nicolas Winding Refn's debut ""Pusher"" from 1996. A nail-biting look at a man running out of options. Refn avoids the cliches, both in the story itself and its telling. Which makes for a realistic tale, of a man, like many other youths, bored, confused and ignorant, digging a deeper and deeper grave for oneself in the rabbit hole of the drug realm.",/review/rw5674516/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2013,FSfilmblog,9," Violent and Unfinching

9 May 2001,McBuff,8," Something's rotten in the State of Denmark
","Grim, tough debut feature from Nicolas Winding Refn (based on his 5 minute short film) tells the story of Frank, a hardnosed drug pusher in Copenhagen, who gets more than he bargained for when a deal goes wrong. His Serbian supplier Milo (Buric, in a standout performance) and henchman Radovan give him one last chance to come up with the money, but as it is nothing goes like planned. Kinetic, realistic and supercharged with sudden bursts of (mostly offscreen) violence and a pounding soundtrack as well as all around knockout performances with Kim Bodnia excellent as Frank. One of the best Danish movies of 1996. ***½ (of ****)",/review/rw5674516/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2021,x_manicure_x,6," First Refn is anti-Refn
","Nicolas Winding Refn's directorial debut is the polar opposite of what would become his trademark style. Shot entirely on a handheld camera with natural lighting and minimal editing, it almost works as a mockumentary on the daily life of a small drug dealer in Copenhagen. The approach is gritty and realistic, and despite having seen the same exact plot in thousands of other films, it still has its own visceral energy and delightfully European charm.",/review/rw5674516/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2019,labng,8," Love this movie. Never gets old.
","I've seen this several times over the years. It's gritty. It's frenetic. This doesn't seem like a pleasant vocation. Most importantly, this is the first place I saw Mads Mikkelsen. He had star written all over him. Now, if I could only pick stocks...",/review/rw5674516/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2012,TermlnatriX,9," A film with true grit
","So in essence, this is a film with true grit. Possibly the grittiest I've seen, literally. Come to think of it, it reminds me of Harlan County, USA documentary, it's dirty, grungy, and perfect for a film with a subject matter this film possesses. Truly, it's as if Nicolas Wending Refn assembled a small crew and started following a real pusher, who gave you an inside look into a week of his life, took you to the seedy, dirty, nasty, harsh (and whatever other synonyms you can throw its way) underworld of the street life so everyone could get an idea of what's it all about and why you probably shouldn't ever get involved. Certainly not a new concept an average man now understands, but it's the way it's all presented that really made me love this film. As I mentioned earlier, the documentary feel of this makes me think Refn had it in his mind when he set out to make this film. The vibe and mood of the film is top notch for the film of this caliber, but really it's the character of Frankie who was fleshed out the most and in the end made me really dig the guy despite essentially who he was, and his profession - though he makes a point later in the film which gives food for thought. What makes it memorable for me is that it isn't devoid of depth, and you get a quick look - which was enough - into each character's life by ways of genuine conversations they're having between each other, which felt like they were ad-libbed, but that's what made it genuine for me.",/review/rw5674516/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 1998,K-Hjorth,9," A different one...
","Pusher is a movie you either love or hate. I'm among those who love it. I especially like the fast cuts between scenes, the camera movements and that the foreign language in the movie hasn't been translated. That gives you a feeling of being there... you're able to feel how the main character must feel in the situations where he's surrounded by the drug dealers. He can't understand what they're saying and must rely on his intuition and their body language - and so is the viewer!",/review/rw5674516/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2015,Leofwine_draca,6," Nicolas Winding Refn's realistic directorial debut
","Nicolas Winding Refn's directorial debut is an engaging, zero-budget story of crime and revenge, a thriller which sees a small-time drug dealer's life spiralling out of control when his latest deal goes bad. Shot on the streets of Denmark in a verite style by a director who already appears accomplished, PUSHER is a fine debut feature.",/review/rw5674516/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 1999,Mike-swe,10," Deserves more than cult fame
","I think this film is almost without flaws. The dialogue, acting, atmosphere,cutting and soundtrack all mesh in a perfect union. The director has not gotten the international recognition he deserves. Unlike Breaking the Waves and The party the qualities of Pusher are mainly relayed through word of mouth and websites like this. I hope he makes it big with up and coming Bleeder...which by the way also is the name of the band fronted by the guy who scores the films music.(Same guy who did music for Pusher). Anybody who thinks tough street action with good dialogue can only be made by yanks like scorsese, mann and tarantino should think twice and check this one out. It's one of the best.",/review/rw5674516/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2010,ilpohirvonen,7," No glamor. Just the reality.
","Nicolas Winding Refn modernized the crime film genre with his Pusher trilogy. Thinking about that and the era he made the first part makes you probably think of another crime film modernizer of the 90's, Quentin Tarantino. He made something totally new in the United States with three crime films: Reservoir Dogs (1992), Pulp Fiction (1994) and Jackie Brown (1997). People often see Tarantino as one of the most important directors in the crime genre, because he influenced it a lot. In the same way Nicolas Winding Refn made something completely original. He made Pusher. A movie about a drug-dealer who gets into a debt swirl. The way Refn shows the lives of the criminals is harsh. It's different from other 90's crime films, because it doesn't show any glamor in the underworld life. No one has got expensive cars, all of them live in their cruddy apartments, they aren't that rich and they all are under the control of their addiction to drugs.",/review/rw5674516/?ref_=tt_urv

4 April 2015,brchthethird,6," Drug Dealers: The Documentary
","Having seen most of Nicolas Winding Refn's recent work, it was kind of awkward going back to his debut feature film. While it does show flashes of brilliance, hints of what Refn's style would develop into, for the most part it's your typical ""mid-level drug dealer gets in over his head"" film that has been many times before (and better). PUSHER follows Frank, a Danish drug dealer who is about to make this huge deal with some Swedes. However, at the moment the deal is about to go down, the cops show up and he has to dump the dope in the river. This puts him in some serious debt to Milo, a Serbian drug lord, and the rest of the film is Frank trying to get the money to pay him back. Before watching this, I did scope a few reviews just to see what kind of film I was getting into, and one comparison I saw a few times was with MEAN STREETS. While I can see the surface similarities, ultimately PUSHER doesn't have as many likable characters and feels more amateurish. Since I don't speak Danish, I can't really say whether the acting was good for sure, but it didn't seem too bad. The production values were also pretty good for a low-budget indie film. Even the script and dialogue weren't too bad. My favorite parts were in the first 20-30 minutes when Frank and his best friend, Tonny (Mads Mikkelsen), share some Tarantino-esque exchanges about whatever was on their minds at the time. However, once the plot kicks in, whatever sense of fun the film had before was all but gone. I don't mind gritty realism, and the cinema verite style in which the film is shot was handled quite well, but I never connected with the story all that much. It also didn't help that Frank was such an unlikeable prick. For my money, Tonny was the most interesting character, but he's not in the film for too long. Fortunately I am aware that Tonny is the focus of the the sequel, so it has that much going for it. Ultimately, PUSHER is a well-made film that shows some of the talent that Refn would later put to great use, but the story has been done many times before, and better.",/review/rw5674516/?ref_=tt_urv
