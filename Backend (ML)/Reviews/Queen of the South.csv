10 August 2018,paulclaassen,8," Much better than expected superhero action drama.
","I must be honest, it took me a while before I finally decided to watch this, as I'm not a big Hollywood superhero movie fan. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. Gil Gadot is excellent as Wonder Woman and lends credibility to the naive title character. The chemistry between her and Chris Pine was wonderful and made for a very believable love story. It felt very natural and romance between them seemed inevitable.",/review/rw7168607/?ref_=tt_urv

4 June 2017,planktonrules,7," A review from an older guy who is not a huge fan of superhero films.
","Whether or not you'll love ""Wonder Woman"" no doubt will depend on the individual. The die-hard superhero film lovers have embraced the picture and it's setting box office records...and these folks really shouldn't read or pay much attention to my review. This is because I am over 50 and got tired of the genre long, long ago. I went to quite a few of the films because my daughters love them and this time was was actually taken to the theater by my wife, as she loves the idea of a female superhero. So, if you fall into my demographics...this review is for you!",/review/rw7168607/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2021,ginasharp,10," Warrier Princess at her best!
","I was expecting the ""glitzy"" curvy wonder woman which I loved in the 80's but VERY pleasantly surprised to find the Warrier Princess side of her that deeply cares for humanity and the good that are in people. She is unconcerned with her looks and trying to impress others, and way more concerned with saving the world as she was meant to do. This film really showed the process of her becoming a true heroine! She loves, she protects, she saves. Wonder Woman is a great character and I think she was cast beautifully! She looks ""other-worldly"" beautiful and fit the part so well. The film was written well to show her innocence of the ""real"" world, her joy of seeing it and it's people for the first time, and her passion for saving us all!",/review/rw7168607/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2021,adamsmith-51004,8," ""I will fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.""
","Wonder Woman was much better than anything else DC has released in a very long time, and it was a pretty great film, but was it as amazing as everyone say it was or are we all a bit bias due to the hype surrounding the film? In the first blockbuster superhero film featuring Wonder Woman since the 1970's, we see Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) sitting in her office, remembering how it all started, and we are thrown back to the Island of the Amazons, where she is a little girl. We see her grow up and go through her training, with her aunt played admirably by the Princess Bride herself, Robin Wright, making an epic comeback. After which, a series of events lead her to meet a man and leave the island to join the war effort in England. Gal Gadot played Wonder Woman and she was truly something special. While everyone got caught up in the hype of the fact that DC made a good movie, that didn't center around Batman, and the fact that this film was centered on a female superhero, they failed to see just how unoriginal the story actually was. As I was watching the scenes on this Island, with Diana growing up, not knowing what she really was, and leaving before she was ready, I was very much reminded of Thor, but that was just the first hour of the film. I thought things would get better but they didn't. She becomes this unexpected larger than life hero in World War I, much in the way that Captain America did in World War II. Both of them fought really bad guys who weren't the ""main"" bad guy behind the war, and then there is the whole God angle, which brings us right back to Thor again. The film was so well done, I think it is more than time we had a strong female hero that young girl can emulate and look up to, and I thought Gal Gadot was a breath of fresh air, who gave an outstanding performance. As far as originality goes, to me it just wasn't there, as it seems the writers took elements from two of the more popular Marvel films and mashed them together. The Bottom Line, Wonder Woman is absolutely worth seeing, however I'm all for original ideas, and I want to see something different, especially at a time when a new superhero film is coming out every month.",/review/rw7168607/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2021,kevin_robbins,8," The special effects and action scenes are very well done as is the depiction of the time period and the challenges and perception of women.
","Wonder Woman (2017) is a movie we saw in theatres as soon as it was released. The storyline follows the rise of Diana among the Amazonians who are a group of females on an island isolated from civilization. When a human appears during the World War it springs Diana into action to discover what could be behind the war and how she can stop it. This movie is directed by Patty Jenkins (Monster) and stars Gal Gadot (Death on the Nile), Chris Pine (Star Trek), Robin Wright (Forest Gump) and Ewen Bremner (Trainspotting). The storyline for this is very well done and does a great job of introducing Wonder Woman as a character. I loved the depiction of the Amazonians and how it established the character from the foundation up. The special effects and action scenes are very well done as is the depiction of the time period and the challenges and perception of women. The villain was the only let down and I didn't love the final fight sequence, but 80% of this movie is a 10/10. I would score this a solid 8/10 and strongly recommend seeing this. It is borderline worth adding to your movie collection.",/review/rw7168607/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2022,Broadbean,8," A good re-imagination of the legend

20 June 2017,Mr-Fusion,8," DC finds its footing
","There's a lot that went into ""Wonder Woman""; it's partially a romantic comedy, coming-of-age story, period action/superhero movie, but maybe above all, a love story. Diana Prince gears up ultimately out of love - which doesn't sound like something that'd fit very well in a war movie. Part of the reason this movie is so good is that it had big boots to fill. The DC movies haven't been stellar up to this point, and their inherent dreariness hasn't helped matters. And here's a movie with competent direction, gorgeous visuals and a lead actress that's fully up to the challenge. Gal Gadot instills in her character honor, innocence, and the necessary color to really bring a comic book movie to the screen.",/review/rw7168607/?ref_=tt_urv

","Chris Pine had way more dialogue than Gal Gadot. Not gonna go into why I think that is or why just about every other actor had more lines than her. I just hope everything improves with the next movie. I think he got equal screen-time, if not not more than Gal as well. This is Wonder Woman right? Not Steve Trevor, wonder man.",/review/rw7168607/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2017,rgkarim,9," Wander Over To Wonder!
","It's a brand-new month and you know what that means right? Yes, another super hero movie to kick off the summer blockbuster season. This time it isn't Marvel cranking out the comic book, cinematic feature, but their rivals DC studios. With its recent shaky track record, the DC cinematic universe hasn't gotten the best publicity in terms of quality. So, the studio has decided to get the leading lady herself to pave the way. Yes, today's review is on Wonder Woman starring Gal Gadot and Chris Pine. Can this movie break the bad luck streak of DC/WB studios?

11 February 2018,classicsoncall,7," ""...your wrath upon this world is over.""
","It must be I'm becoming jaded watching super-hero movies because this film, given all the hype, left me mostly unimpressed. Sure it had colorful costumes and action galore, but don't they all? The film worked better for me as an origin story for Wonder Woman, but not so much when it moved to the World War I setting. With what's going on in the DC Comic movie universe, I thought the action would have been better placed in the present day. Gal Gadot does cut an impressive figure as Wonder Woman, but surprisingly, she seemed out of her league with the other female warriors on Themyiscira doing battle with the Germans. Maybe it was her youthful appearance beside Robin Wright's Antiope and Connie Nielsen's Hippolyta. The other distracting thing that kept intruding on my thoughts was how does a guy like Sir Patrick Morgan (David Thewlis) manage his role as a leader of the Allies while at the same time commanding the enemy as Ares, the God of War? You would think he'd be missed by one side or the other during strategic missions. Anyway, the picture left me with virtually no feelings about it at all when it was over, and that's not a good thing for building and extending a franchise. I'm glad I stuck around for the end credits though, or I would not have come across the name of the actor who portrayed The Chief. It was Eugene Brave Rock - how cool a name is that?",/review/rw7168607/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2017,RforFilm,10," Like the real Wonder Woman that was sculpted in clay, the movie is god-like is how fantastic it is in every field.
","When it comes to women superheroes, it seems that they have more of a prominence within comics rather then their film adaptations. A lot of that has to do with that there are simply more men then women that even wear the capes, as it seemed that the image of the comic book seemed more like a boys thing. Of course that's far from the truth as not only plenty women read comic books, but comics themselves have proved that they can be an art. So for each Spider-Man, Batman, and Iron Man, where are the women heroes like Captain Marvel, Batgirl, and of course, Wonder Woman? ",/review/rw7168607/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2021,vargaleonard,7," Gal Gadot is Perfectly Cast as Wonder Woman
","Gal Gadot is perfectly cast and her interaction with Chris Pine on screen is great, their characters have a lot of chemistry. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, but some parts seem to drag a little, but it doesn't really affect the enjoyment of the film for me.

","Maybe, one of the most inspired films about WWI. and one of the most impressive Wonder Woman performances. because it has the best plot, the director, the actors . I say that without be a fan of Marvel universe and defining the super-heroes of series as ""American culture stuffs"". but this film has many virtues. first - a seductive perspective about near reality, bitter references, good pledge for fundamental values and , sure, Gal Gadot brilliant work. pieces of mithology and war. and a photo. as good start for a character who, in Superman vs. Batman was the not official lead character and who, in this film, gives more than a beautiful job.",/review/rw7168607/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's a pretty good movie, as you probably have already heard if you follow the reviews. I was a bit worried.

And Gal Gadot, who would thought, is the ultimate incarnation of Wonder Woman. The first thing that will be in my mind if I hear or see about this character, will be Gal Gadot's face.
