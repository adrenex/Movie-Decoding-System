","Boardwalk Empire is one of the best shows I've ever seen. The acting and writing are as good as anything you'll see on tv. The production is also fantastic, the attention to detail is just incredible. It tells the story of Atlantic City politician/gangster, Enoch ""Nucky"" Thompson (Steve Buscemi), and how he runs the town both legally and criminally. He runs it with his brother Elias (Shea Whigham), who is also the Sheriff, and their gang of tough guys. It takes place during prohibition and Nucky is the #1 distributor of illegal alcohol. He does this while doing business with some of the most notorious gangsters in American history like Al Capone, Lucky Luciano, Jim Colosimo, Arnold Rothstein, among others. There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said about this incredible show so just go watch it. You won't be disappointed!",/review/rw5771314/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2020,Supermanfan-13,10," Don't Miss This Show!
","Boardwalk Empire is absolutely, without a doubt one the best gangster shows ever created. Every season is as addictive as the last. Steve Buscemi leads an amazing cast as he gives one of the best performances ever put on tv! This is tv at its best so don't miss it!",/review/rw5771314/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2023,estathena2,8," Full Series Review
","A worthwhile series that starts off incredibly strong & maintains its seductive pull throughout. Reminiscent of The Sopranos but set in the prohibition era, the attention to detail - from clothing, set design, to music draws you in and holds your attention.",/review/rw5771314/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2020,Clive_W,10," Bullets and heads will role
","This show has to be one of my personal favourites, I would always recommend people to check out.
In terms of the show itself, you've got an awesome cast of great actors, with some the most beautiful cinematography, and hands down the story is just fantastic. You've got historical true elements mixed of course with fictional aspects, more so on the fictional side but it's just amazing to see these actors play out some the most iconic historic mobsters, Stephen Graham as Al Capone is just amazing, one my top favourite actors to see on screen.
And ultimately one the best endings to a show, with no spoilers the story comes full circle, with a satisfying end.",/review/rw5771314/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2022,ben-mckimm,9," Wow
",It was nearly perfect. I feel like the final season was a little unnecessary but they made it work. Richard Harrow is probably my favourite character from anything ever and I know they think they used him just enough but they could have featured him just a little more.,/review/rw5771314/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2010,intelearts,9," My 347th Review: ...this is as good as TV gets....
","With production values that are mind-boggling, cast, and a budget to die for HBO is now what film studios were in the 1930s, they have the clout and the ability to go way further than most films can - and you get episode after episode.",/review/rw5771314/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2022,oscarjneklund,9," What a show! ðŸŽ¥
","This show, wow! High quality, old history environment at it's finest. Steve Buscemi has to be one of the greatest actors of all time, he really knows how to get into character. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡²",/review/rw5771314/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2020,dogonlion,10," A masterpiece !
","The writing, acting, music, historical events. It's all there. Then you have Martin Scorsese involved, so what can go wrong?",/review/rw5771314/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2020,rukstar69,9," Brilliant from top to bottom.
",This show is amazing all around such great acting and story line. It's one of those shows that needs time to set things up so if it seems slow and confusing at first try and stick it out. I love seeing all these big time crime syndicates come up and thru the ranks. The way they can transform a set back 100 years with such precision and accuracy is astounding to me. Sopranos is my favorite show ever and you'll see a lot of these actors and actresses in this series.,/review/rw5771314/?ref_=tt_urv

8 March 2022,luckeyburrows,10," Outstanding
","This is is definitely worth watching. From the year 1920 to 1931 this classic gangster show and it's music and the character Richard Harrow is one of the best ones I've ever seen. I highly recommend you watch this, from the writer of The Sopranos.",/review/rw5771314/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2022,ColtPython82,10," Amazing show, almost like a prequel to Sopranos. But where's the Capone sequel series?
","I love Boardwalk Empire, it's like a Soprano's mafia origin story. But a lingering question I've always had is why didn't they make a Boardwalk Empire sequel series starring Capone, Meyer, and Lucky? The show set up a new series perfectly with the introduction of these characters and a sequel show set in Chicago would've been amazing. Actually the actors who played them are the perfect age now to play these historical characters, so hopefully the show runners give it a thought.",/review/rw5771314/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2021,soulfx-1,8," Starts off great, interesting ending
",Starts off great as you learn about the corruption spreading as prohibition takes off. It's a story of morality and it doesn't have a happy ending.,/review/rw5771314/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2021,douglasmcbroom,9," ""I Am Not Seeking Forgiveness""
","Boardwalk Empire is a brilliant series, created by Terence Winter and exec produced by Martin Scorsese and Mark Wahlberg. It also showcases the work of director Tim Van Patton and many of the actors involved with The Sopranos-still the G. O. A. T. Yet, whilst Empire is one of the greats, in my book, it is on the second tier of that list. That is mostly because of the 5th Season, but I'll get to that later.",/review/rw5771314/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2021,meeTarantino,9," You can't be half a gangster

17 October 2021,gfargas-97361,9," Gripping...
","Anyone who is interested in the Mafia will love this series. Prohibition era series set in Atlantic City starring Steve Buscemi just makes for a fantastic show. Great acting, great action scenes, sex, manipulation, tragedy, comedy and much more. This show had me hooked from the very beginning and though there were a few problems later on in the show it still never disappoints. Any problems that occurred were definitely made up for and I highly recommend watching all the way through.",/review/rw5771314/?ref_=tt_urv

16 July 2022,daycu-,," One of HBOs finest shows!!
","This show is pure art!! It's easily one of the best gangster dramas out there. From the amazing lead performance from Steve Buscemi, to the precise attention to detail, the casting, and most of all the production design... Man it's just breathtaking at times. Each episode feels like a movie and is very cinematic. Boardwalk Empire can be surprisingly funny at times, but at it's core it remains a very dark lavish show with lots of twists.",/review/rw5771314/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2021,elliotjeory,9," Great show
","Boardwalk empire is a brilliant show, I love prohibition-era films and TV shows. It has so many great characters, Chalky White, Mickey Doyle, Remus and of course Nelson who I think was my favourite. I liked the inclusion of historical crime figures too. Capone, lucky, Meyer etc. You learn a lot of key events from the 1920s era.
The work that has gone into the production really deserves credit, great acting and script.",/review/rw5771314/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2020,robalexhawk,9," 1920s gangsters at their best
","At first when I started this series, I thought it would be just another typical gangster TV show with not much of a plot or well developed characters. However, season 3 onward, the show really grew on me.",/review/rw5771314/?ref_=tt_urv
