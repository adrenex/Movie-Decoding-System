10 September 2022,tresm87,8," A welcome Whale of a comeback for the beloved Brendan Fraser.
",Let me start by saying I've been a fan of Fraser since seeing Encino Man as a kid and this guy will always be one of my favorites. To see him somehow thrown out of Hollywood/not casted for the most part for the past decade was very frustrating for me. It was about time someone gave him another chance which Aronofsky and A24 did and it proved successful mainly because of Brendan's dedicated and emotional performance.,/review/rw8842599/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,rdoyle29,8," An okay film with an incredible performance
","I think there are some good reasons to criticize this film. It's a fairly stage bound adaptation of a play. That's not always a bad thing. In many cases, staging a film very similarly to the way the play was staged accentuates what works about the play. I don't think it really does here, and the film's repetitive structures leads to some dead patches. There's also a powerfully melodramatic tone to this film that I'm frankly just a bit unsure of.",/review/rw8842599/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,RahulM007,8," Brendan Fraser gives a raw and chill-inducing performance
","Darren Aronofsky's ""The Whale"" is a deeply moving story about redemption, loss, and trauma. It revolves around a morbidly obese middle-aged man named Charlie who after losing his boyfriend goes into complete shock and denial and starts to gain weight uncontrollably. After his boyfriend tragically passed away, Charlie gives up hope and becomes a nihilist and rather pessimistic, as opposed to an eternal optimist in which he is remembered as. He uses food as a coping mechanism to suppress his deep-rooted feelings. This insatiable hunger lasts for eight years, until his rebellious daughter Ellie shows up. Charlie wants to reconnect with his estranged daughter, whereas his daughter feels differently. The title refers to Herman Melville's seminal novel ""Moby Dick"", which plays an important part in the narrative of the movie. In fact, it foreshadows the eventual climax of the film, which will tear audiences apart. The final minutes of the film completely wrecked me, thanks to Brendan Fraser's incredible performance and his instant chemistry with Sadie Sink. I wouldn't be surprised if the film garners Oscar nominations in the best actor and best supporting actress categories for Brendan Fraser and Sadie Sink respectively. Hong Chau is a knockout, as well.",/review/rw8842599/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,ferguson-6,8," greatness from Fraser
","Greetings again from the darkness. Brendan Fraser deserves an Oscar nomination. There's a sentence I never even imagined writing. If you recall (and you are excused if you don't), Mr. Fraser's early acting career is noted for such 'prestige' films as ENCINO MAN (1992), GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE (1997), DUDLEY DO-RIGHT (1999), and BEDAZZLED (2000). And yes, I'm being a bit unfair in the films I chose to name, as he has also had some solid performances along the way. However, nothing on his resume could have prepared us for what he delivers on screen in this latest from director Darren Aronofsky (BLACK SWAN, 2010).",/review/rw8842599/?ref_=tt_urv

16 December 2022,Jithindurden,9," Heartbreaking and eye opening
","There's a part of this movie that even before going in I was apprehensive about. Is it exploitative? More than probably, yes. Is it phobic in a certain way? It isn't impossible to think that. But being far removed from certain aspects of what the movie shows and yet being so close and feeling related to a lot of other things the movie portrays, I can only speak from what I got and felt about this movie.",/review/rw8842599/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,beatrice_gangi,9," Started crying on Monday morning
","The film presents a week in the life of a severely obese English teacher named Charlie, from Monday to Friday. By late Monday morning I was already crying hot tears in my seat, while other, more daring viewers trudged through mid-week before giving in. Brendan Fraser's beautiful performance holds the film together and gives it all its power, in a role that I hope will bring him the recognition he deserves. All the rest of the cast also does an excellent job. It is a striking and thought-provoking film, so much so that days later I am still reminded of excerpts from the much-discussed thesis, the absolute protagonist in the film's final insane ten minutes.",/review/rw8842599/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2022,thehumanwritesproject,7," A solid 10 for Brendan Fraser! but THE WHALE gets a 6!
","Brendan Fraser should win every award possible for his role in THE WHALE. This would have been a very easy role to stereotype, yet Fraser made it complex, compelling, full of vulnerability and heart. This film succeeds because of Fraser's performance.",/review/rw8842599/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2022,UniqueParticle,10," Masterful, One of the best movies I've seen!
","I was immersed into this film from start to finish. Darren Aronofky directed a spellbinding emotional triumph in cinema The Whale deserves numerous awards mainly for Branden Frazier! I love the essays, the engaging scenes, how honest everyone is, and heartwarming vibes. I don't have any complaints this is a perfect movie. I hope Branden is ok this movie had of been difficult to make. A tour de force view of an obesity and bonding that is continuously top notch acted. Every scene is worth watching mostly drama and some comedy mashed in well. I hope the movie gets high praise it very much deserves it all, highly recommend The Whale.",/review/rw8842599/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2022,statuskuo,7," Brendan Fraser's Tour De Force
","While the title itself would be a pejorative for someone morbidly obese, it really ties into a story that the lead character Charlie holds dear to his failing heart. That is the story of ""Moby Dick"" Though the tale itself doesn't really come into play, if not for only the last great memory he has is of the sea and of a daughter that he had abandoned when he feel in love with someone of the same sex.",/review/rw8842599/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2023,jdesando,," Fraser will win Globes and Oscar--he's that good.
","See The Whale just to watch consummate actors, Branden Fraser and Sadie Sink, playing father and daughter, furiously catch up with each other after years of separation. Set in Charlie's apartment, just big enough for his morbidly huge body, The Whale is not only about the reconciliation of this odd couple and the survival of obese Charlie but rather about how obsession can consume faster than a greasy piece of pizza.",/review/rw8842599/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,dlmiley,7," 3-act play on film
","I saw ""The Whale"" yesterday starring Brendan Fraser as a morbidly obese man who is eating himself to death after the untimely death of his lover. It is directed by Darren Aronofsky from a play written by Samuel D. Hunter. So, the movie itself is a 3-act play filmed in Fraser's characters Idaho apartment. His only visitors are his nurse, his embittered daughter, a religious missionary boy hoping to convert him, his ex-wife, and his pizza delivery man who has come to know him by name. Fraser is buried under a fat suit simulating a 600-pound man. Many have praised Fraser's performance, and it is very good, but I don't think it is Oscar worthy. Working under heavy makeup is not an automatic Oscar nod IMHO. I was actually more impressed with the supporting players' performances, especially Sadie Sink as his daughter and Hong Chau as his long suffering but devoted nurse. I cannot give the movie my highest rating, but it is still recommended for fans of a well-acted drama in a confined setting. 7/10.",/review/rw8842599/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2023,cgearheart,5," A mean version of The Wrestler (2008)
","I had an incredibly hard time knowing what to write for this movie, but after giving it some long and hard thought, I'm torn. Brendan Fraser gives a career best performance and hits all the right notes, as does the rest of the cast. The issue for me was how the material was handled. I heard so many critics saying how ""kind"" and ""empathetic"" this movie was and how it was Aronofsky's first movie since The Wrestler to accomplish such a thing. The only thing I can say is that this movie is basically a carbon copy of The Wrestler, right down to the ending, but it was anything but empathetic and kind. Unfortunately, one of my biggest complaints of this movie was how mean spirited it was. The only kindness we really get is from Fraser's Charlie. Even Simpkin's ever sweet character succumbs to cruelty. I also understand that the filmmakers want so bad to show food as an addiction, but it got way too over the top. The whole movie, even down to the title, feels more or less like a sideshow attraction to Fraser's character. Plain and simple, it's as much a dramatic character story as it is a deeply cynical body horror film. I'm disappointed.",/review/rw8842599/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2022,FilmFlowCritics,9," Don't judge a book by it's cover...
","I'm not an emotional person per se, but I tried really hard to keep myself together, but Brendan Fraser nearly makes this impossible in the last 10mins of this movie! Having writer Samuel D. Hunter at the screening made this even more emotional and touching and he so deserves an adapted screenplay Oscar for this.",/review/rw8842599/?ref_=tt_urv

7 September 2022,aniceguy1988,10," The Whale is a wonderful surprise masterpiece!
",Brendan Fraser has proved he still has it. It's a beautiful performance that's long overdue for him. A film that will make you cry and love Brendan. A must see. He has long been a fan favorite actor but this Blast from the Past will make you rethink his acting. A brilliant film that is a sneaky great film. If you are on the fence about seeing this you'll regret not seeing it. I felt a sense of sadness and love when watching this film and I cried many times. It's not a film that comes around 9ften but when it does it changes cinema. An Oscar contender film with real heart. The best film of 2022.,/review/rw8842599/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2022,missaymoo92,10," Who wrote a story about my life without my permission???
","I just got back from seeing this movie in theaters. I'm not sure what to say yet because I'm still feeling and processing everything I just watched. All I can say is the performances in this film were incredible all around. I was crying throughout the majority of the film because so much of what was depicted and described in the movie paralleled so many things that I have experienced in my own life. I only wish my dad could have seen this movie before he passed away last year, and that maybe we could have talked about it if we had been in touch the last couple of years. This movie probably will not affect everyone the same way but it definitely had an impact on me. I've never seen anything like this before. Ever.",/review/rw8842599/?ref_=tt_urv

15 December 2022,george.schmidt,8," Fraser shines in a complex career-high turn.
","THE WHALE (2022) ***1/2 Brendan Fraser, Sadie Sinks, Ty Simpkins, Hong Chau, Samantha Morton. Fraser gives a career high performance of depth and heartbreak as an obese man attempting redemption in rekindling his relationship with his estranged teenage daughter (Sinks all seething contempt) before his health completely betrays him. Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky's adaptation of Samuel D. Hunter's play plumbs the depths of humanity and allows his star to shine buried under a mountain of prosthetics by Adrien Morot in a tightrope act of what could've been a disdainful freak show or worse a melodramatic mess.",/review/rw8842599/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,doomedmac,7," The Whale
","The Whale is a movie that demands A LOT from its audience. It demands your sympathy, your time, and your patience. It feels pointless to give praise to Brendan for his performance. He kills it. He yells and stretches out his arm and rips your heart out. The rest of the cast does a good job. The script is pretty decent, but not every line is perfect or great.",/review/rw8842599/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,jnrdkkb,10," This film left me speechless.
","Beautifully crafted, vulnerable, yet gripping. Extremely visceral from the get-go, starting with a memorable (and uncomfortable) first scene. It doesn't lose its grip on you until the touching, heart-wrenching end. The camera is very opinionated in showing you a POV and it's based on the screenwriter's own experience struggling to connect with a younger person whilst self-medicating through food. Critics please note - it's not a film about fat people or being fat. At it's heart, it's themes are quite deep - redemption, self loathing, emotional honesty, judgement from others and the struggle to find real connection. Incredible and challenging performances, especially from Brendan and Sadie.",/review/rw8842599/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,sme3,7," Outstanding Performances, Mediocre Material
","While Brendan Fraser has the most showy role, all of the cast members turn in outstanding performances which are the main reasons to see this film. Darren Aronofsky mostly keeps what story there is moving forward and being compelling. Adapted from a play, the single-setting film overly-emphasizes its dialogue and is visually uninteresting other than perhaps encouraging viewers to marvel at Brendan Fraser's makeup. Before reaching its somewhat predictable ending, the film begins to lose a little steam. Touching on many topics, the film invites audiences to discern meaning from the viewing experience, but the film is subtle enough that meaning may elude some audiences.",/review/rw8842599/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2023,panagiotis1993,2," Pretentious Disaster: One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen!
","The fact that people think that this movie deserves oscars and awards is absolutely crazy to me. The plot and writing are a convoluted mess. They really try to be deep but fail miserably. This has to be one of the most depressing, miserable, annoying and disturbing movies I've ever seen, also boring. I really want my money and time back, watched it in theatre. Three times I wanted to get up and leave but I was curious to see how it ends. Well the ending was disappointing and pointless just like I expected. This movie is supposed to be about a dying man who is very sick because of obesity complications, trying to reconnect with his daughter, trying to right his wrongs.",/review/rw8842599/?ref_=tt_urv
