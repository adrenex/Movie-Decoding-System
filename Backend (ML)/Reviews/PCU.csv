2 August 2022,aronofskydavid,4," A Lousy Movie Despite Despite The Great Story And Fine Acting
","I generously give this film 4 stars because the story is terrific even though the movie messes far too much with its much more interesting actual history. I am a fan of early 19th Century English boxing and looked forward to seeing this, especially with Russell Crowe in the cast. The acting is fine, as is the casting, and unlike some critics I like the cinematography. The film also does sort of okay capturing the time's fight game corruption and brutality. However, the script is atrocious, the directing almost as bad, and whoever edited the movie should find some other line of work because scene transitions are so poorly done. All the main film characters existed and had interesting lives. Jem Belcher, England's boxing champion in the very early 19th Century, came from a long line of good family prize fighters including his grandfather Jack Slack, ably played by Russell Crowe, and his father, who is inexplicably nowhere to be seen in the movie. Jem's classic fight with Henry Pearce may have been Europe's best one ever, but its depiction here does little justice to what really happened. I often like shorter movies but this one could have used about 15 more minutes to flesh out the true main character lives. Matt Hookings plays Belcher well and Jodhi May plays his mother, who hated fighting because she grew up with it, even better. Ray Winstone, always amazingly good, gives a performance as Belcher's trainer even better than Crowe's, so those who appreciate quality acting can see this one without feeling like they wasted their time despite the film's serious flaws. With some harder production work this might have been good enough for some award nominations. Instead, I hope the Razzies bypass it for the hard-working cast's sake.",/review/rw8414161/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2022,martindavies-95196,8," Entertaining biopic
","Just watched this and enjoyed this biopic of prizefighter Jem Belcher ; not sure how historically accurate it actually is but was entertained throughout with the storyline and good fight sequences , well acted by all with as usual standout performances by Ray winstone and Russell Crowe and a good performance from the lead actor too , well worth seeing.",/review/rw8414161/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2022,A_Different_Drummer,7," the audience is not the winner here
","The greatest boxing film of all time -- of many to choose from -- is Cinderella Man (2005). It is technically perfect, it remains exhilarating no matter how many times you watch it, it is on my IMDb list of great films, and it stars Russell Crowe. This boxing film also stars Russell Crowe. But the similarities end there. This film is an interesting experiment in combining a sports film with an historical biography ... to see how they mix? The result is entertaining, but in many places awkward and imbalanced. The moment the protagonist becomes champion, he immediately chooses a dark path. The viewer is disappointed. The moment the protagonist has a chance at redemption, the scriptwriter (who is also the star!) borrows every trope and trick you have ever seen in a Rocky film, and throws them onscreen. To see what sticks. Another disappointment. The pattern becomes clear. No matter how often Belcher wins, the audience always ends up the loser.",/review/rw8414161/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2022,bodhi_74,7," Worth watching
","Pretty good film, good story, some great acting - especially by Winstone - but it doesn't inspire you or evoke emotion like Cinderella Man. Still recommend it though.",/review/rw8414161/?ref_=tt_urv

30 July 2022,ian-39125,7," All the hard yards are here?
","Not sure why it has such a low score from the critics compared to the popcorn audience. I enjoyed it. Found it believable. Maybe it's too real. Making a champion is simple. But the simplest things can be difficult. And boring to watch perhaps. Perhaps it's just a little too British? Especially the ending. If you love sports biographies, it's worth a watch.",/review/rw8414161/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2022,Millbags09,2," So poor in so many ways.
","This can only be described as a poor film. A poor film with a weird Instagram type filter applied to the whole thing. Russell Crowe lifts the few scenes he appears in and Ray Winston is always watchable but the lead is poor and his acting isn't good enough to carry the movie. I fear he was trying to 'do a Stallone' by writing and starring in this film but this is no Rocky. It feels like a really poor TV movie from over 30 years ago. The strangest thing is the 10 out of 10 reviews, very sus. I'm sure none of the film's production team have been on here leaving reviews!?!",/review/rw8414161/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2022,elisaa-63297,1," Very poor movie
","I love boxing movies and have seen them all. This was like some amateurish production. Matt H cannot act to save himself. Maybe a better lead actor could have lifted this movie up to mediocrity. Russel Crowe was the only good thing about this movie. Don't waste your time watching it, frankly I'd rather have gone to the dentist than watch this!",/review/rw8414161/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2022,robmilnerfhm-63116,3," Like Rocky in the old time.... but low quality...
","It was entertaining enough and I watched it all however it never really felt like 1800, the clothes where too 'new' and the lighting on it was too bright. Ray Winstone is a great actor and his quality was completely wasted on this, he was light years ahead of the rest of the cast (except Russel Crowe who was also sound), just lacked a degree of believability for me to actually enjoy it.",/review/rw8414161/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2022,MovieAddict725484,1," Vanity Calamity
","A scriptwriter's passion project to showcase himself/herself as the next big thing is a noble quest laden with pressure and risk, but the rewards of such a venture can be game changing. It's clear the creator's approach to this production never gave it a fighting chance. It's so poor, on so many levels (the script, the excruciating rocky-esque montage, and those dodgy accents to name but a few lowlights). It's common knowledge you can neither polish or buff one up, yet despite best efforts made, the flecks of A-List showbiz glitter (in the form of Crowe and Winstone) failed to stick to this giant turd. As for us all being 'introduced' to Matt Hookings, by none other than Matt Hookings himself, this truly is a modern day tale of how one man's dream can turn into a bored & curious Amazon Prime subscriber's nightmare.",/review/rw8414161/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2022,johnascough-61241,10," A great movie with outstanding music!
","I really enjoyed 'Prizefighter'. The story and acting is incredible with great camera-work and cinematography. However, my favourite element of the whole movie was the music and score, especially the wonderfully reverby and atmospheric vocals. I feel the vocals add another depth and texture to the music and it really helps you become immersed in the story and become a part of 'Prizefighter's' world. The vocalist is very talented as well as the whole team involved with the score. I definitely recommend you watch!",/review/rw8414161/?ref_=tt_urv

23 July 2022,carl-carritt,5," Run of the mill, could've been great

30 July 2022,vmvvfwq,1," Did Stallone steal this story?
","You know that age old question "" what came first? The chicken or the egg?"", well this is a real conundrum on how Stallone may have got his inspiration for Rocky! Unlike Rocky however, this is a terrible film. I am not sure how they managed to rope in Winstone and Crowe but things must be very desperate in their schedules to take on the roles they did. The story is poorly told, the acting is awful and the overall look is just terrible. I'm sure the historical significance is an important part of boxing history in England BUT this was a movie that the makers should have thrown in the towel after the first round!",/review/rw8414161/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2022,Chrispearce2,5," Rocky IV this is not
","I take my hat of to Matt Hookings for righting and directing this but it's been done before and better, standard plot line and I didn't overly care for his character. Ray Winston does a great turn as Ray Winston (no harm, no foul ðŸ˜ƒ) but Cinderella Man or million Dollar baby had me both heavily invested in characters and in tears at points, this has neither. Watch, Enjoy & Review.",/review/rw8414161/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2022,mujali-48677,2," Poor
","I was looking forward to this film as I am a fan of boxing history and British history in general. In addition, I love the big fella Russell Crowe and it was great to see Jodhi May back on screen again as she is immensely talented and the last time I saw her was 1990 in the Last of the Mohicans. Unfortunately though, I should have gone in expecting disappointment, because this movie really fell short of the mark in pretty much every way. It felt inauthentic, from the dialogue (basic, at times cringe, I very much doubt that Ray Winstone's brand of Cockney-isms would have been in use then) to the stereotypical generic upper class toff villain. Also, how can people living in the early 1800s have such good skincare? These moans aside, the film felt rushed, there was hardly any middle, and as a result there was no real bridge between beginning and ending, leaving very little character development/viewer engagement and the whole thing utterly disjointed. You can't make a grand stand finish work if there is no momentum to precede it.",/review/rw8414161/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,nikwadsworth,8," Prizefighter - Belcher Biopic - Well worth a viewing
",Thoroughly enjoyed the performances from Russell Crowe as Jack Slack and Matt Hookings as Jim Belcher. But loved Ray Winstone in particular as Bill Warr. I'm sure the purists will have a good moan about it's actual accuracy but just watch it and enjoy the different layers of the film.
