22 August 2019,A_Llama_Drama,9," Sexy, classy legal drama
","For five years, during its original runtime, I avoided watching ""The Good Wife."" I didn't see the appeal in a show about a corrupt official and his lawyer wife. Even with the constant adverts from More Four, it just never appealed to me.",/review/rw6918886/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2015,maria-ricci-1983,10," I cannot recommend this show enough. It is a jewel!
","Why is The Good Wife such an extraordinary show? (I write this while eagerly waiting for the fist episode of Season 7) 1) The character. Alicia is independent, but not a feminist; she sometimes fails, but she never gives up; she is deep, but witty and funny; she has principles, but is sexy; she is true to herself, but dares to experiment and change; she is wise, but you can never take her for granted. In a word, Alicia is brain, morals, fun and passion.",/review/rw6918886/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2009,schnappi_croc,9," Love this Show. Hate to see each episode end.
","This is the best new show of the season. The ""story within a story"" method is used to great effect, as we follow Alicia's marital woes, the inter-office politics, the husband's efforts to get out of prison, and the family ups and downs at home. Interwoven with these ongoing plot lines, there's a new legal case to tackle each week. I find this show a rich combination of humour, pathos, romance, mystery...",/review/rw6918886/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2010,chillgreg,9," One of the best legal dramas I've ever seen - compelling viewing (Review updated May 2012)
","First post. Thanks to other IMDb reviews, I decided to give The Good Wife a try. And boy I was not disappointed. Julianna Margulies leads a stellar ensemble cast, the acting and script writing is near-flawless, and the weekly stories are believable yet not over-the-top. A nice almost Thriller main storyline flows throughout the episodes, adding a compelling undercurrent to what could have been just another legal drama.",/review/rw6918886/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2009,blanbrn,7," A woman scorned by scandal and a sex affair, branches off to independence to fight for justice and success.
","This show can certainly be relevant with all of the political sexual affair scandals of recent years. As many high profile politicians have been known in recent years to cheat and have affairs on their wives. To name a few you have John Edwards, Mark Sanford, John Ensign, and most memorable was Eliot Spitzer who cheated and had an affair with a hooker that's the theme that this new drama ""The Good Wife"" took a page from and started the book. Only later the pages turn over to new chapters of independence in which new answers and the search for justice is sought.",/review/rw6918886/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2014,Shopaholic35,8," An excellent drama.
","Initially before you watch this show you may believe that The Good Wife is just another legal/political drama but it is so much more. It actually is very witty, intelligent and well researched. The subject matter is also very relevant to today's society. You get an insightful view into the corrupted world of politics and the daily moral struggles lawyers must face.",/review/rw6918886/?ref_=tt_urv

","I keep under-estimating this drama; perhaps because there are no big names associated with the production of it - my mistake! This drama continues to capture me hook, line and sinker every week.

3 July 2014,ada-767-840531,6," started good
","Well i started watching this show recently.I was intrigued while watching pilot episode-very interesting and somewhat different then most of ""lawyer"" shows.It's not only about cases it has also back story regarding alicia and her unfaithful husband.Season 1 us full of twists and turns and engaging.we get a very good character development.Characters grow with the time..and by the end of season another love story emerges.It;s between alicia and will,her boss and her friend,who gave her chance to work,after 13 years not working.I think that actor playing will gardner did great job,and chemistry between him and alicia is portrayed very well.Noth did great job as Peter Florrick,and so did Baranski playing Diane Lockhart.All in all acting is pretty well.Season 2 is also great and this one is concentrated on Alicia and Will,their relationship-also very engaging and interesting.However from season 3 i felt something's changed.I felt like they are retelling us the same story again with a minor differences.Now Peter is running for governor.Some of the characters were no more interesting to me,for instance Kalinda-who was such an interesting character in first 2 seasons.Even Alicia,the central character lost something-i felt like the character development stopped here and now we are going back and forth with no particular reason.In my opinion this show could have had 2 or 3 great seasons and then end.All in all it's interesting lawyer show but it starts getting repetitive after a while.But i'd gladly watch again first 2 seasons though.",/review/rw6918886/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2014,bjarias,9," ..9+...only because we all have to anticipate there could be another
","Across the board every facet of this show is top notch.. writing, casting, acting, directing, production values, etc., etc. It's no fluke it is regarded as one of the best programs on television today and it can stand on its' own merit as one of the best all-time. It's extremely difficult for any show to maintain high quality on all levels from week to week.. but from season to season, it's darn near impossible. This show has well achieved this impossibility. Does it keep going.. it's hoped so.. but you get the distinct feeling that if and when it starts to slip in any category, it will come to an abrupt end. You do not want to have its' legacy in any way tarnished it's just been too outstanding to let that happen. It would be easy to single out a couple of the actors for praise, but we all have our choice favorites. It's been said television programming has been slipping over recent years, that shows are nowhere near as good as they once were... The Good Wife shatters that argument completely. So now it has finally come to the end (after seven seasons), and it would be easy to nitpick the final episode (which seriously was pretty darn good)... but we all know we have been most fortunate to have had a front row seat to one of the best programs that TV has ever recently produced.",/review/rw6918886/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2010,galensaysyes,7," Soapy seduction
","If I were limiting my rating of this show to the realm of present-day American TV, I'd rate it a 9.5. It's the only show I go out of my way to see. And why? Because it's the only one that gets me worked up over the characters, in other ways than by having them murdered or suffering from some dire disease. Dramatic involvement has fallen out of fashion on TV in the U.S.--most shows are too cool to care--and so I take an old-fashioned satisfaction in becoming variously worried, relieved, angry, or cheerful about what the characters are doing and what is done to them. My suspension of disbelief is facilitated by a sharp cast and vivid direction, which puts emotional suspense and its concomitants--focus, pace, mood, foreshadowing--ahead of all else.

18 August 2017,JamesRutland,1," sadist cynical series where evil wins and people are under the measure of egoism they serve to idolize themselves deceived by a false sense of greatness
","This series is well made but its aim is to show in good way the evil in the individuals which manage power and laws disdaining human beings. The cynicism is to paint in good way the evil so to make it gracious; also the good figures are in some way bad because they appear as pathetically hypocrite full of false goodness unable to recognize the evil in front of them. This kind of series is the attempt to undermine the evil within the hearts of people embellishing it with curiosity and morbidity. The only benefit concerns with the description of what USA are: a false evil tyranny full of false dreams by which to scam citizen based on the contempt and corruption of human life. As far as the narrative structure a lot of incoherence is present: processes ends soon; the protagonist wants to be a good state attorney to pursue honesty but during her contest helps assassins, drug system and other criminal to avoid the condemnation. Many characters and situations are ridiculous. The good directing and pace seem only to mask these weaknesses. A series to depict a cynical evil world where greedy enriched, criminal system and power individuals represent the mediocrity of the society with their useless existences which damage and corrupt the life of the whole community (""the only ""good"" message"": the system is completely corrupt and you are part of this system).",/review/rw6918886/?ref_=tt_urv

","I positively loved the first 4 seasons of this series and couldn't wait for the next. However, Season 5 has left me cold.

17 December 2010,Mydbe,10," The Good Wife is a GREAT SHOW!
","I have to say that I simple love The Good Wife. When I first saw previews of the show when it was starting, I was a little hesitant to watch it. Thank Goodness I watched it! I LOVE it. I am a mother of 3, and (lets say age 40+), but when I get ready to watch this show I feel like a teenager again. I wait until it is on Demand after it air on Tuesday nights, and I watch it all alone the next day. But I have to definitely wait until my husband and children are asleep. I do not want anyone to talk to me, nor answer the phone when I watch The Good Wife. This show is so great! It is not only interesting in sense of court cases of great interest, but also has awesome personal issues & interests. When my oldest daughter sees me watch the upcoming previews on occasion if she is watching TV, and I say that I LOVE this show and cant wait to watch it when everyone is asleep, she laughs and says it sounds like a stupid show or soap opera. She says the title alone. But she has no idea how great this show and writers, actors & actresses are. I love all the cast, each and everyone one of them. My personal feelings towards the relationship side to the show: I wish Alicia works things out with her husband and just moves on from this. She already proved to everyone that she can get herself out there, work on a great professional level, and let nothing interfere with what happen with Peter. She holds her own. I love Alicia. I like Will also, but I rather see them as co-workers and friends only. I think if the writers put them together it will change the show entirely-as referring to its title. I also love Ely Gold! His character is so great. He can do anything he sets his mind to do. I love when he told Zack's friend Becca off and threatened her when she was putting things out there and hurting Zack's family. He set her straight, I laughed at that one. He seems to be everywhere when needed. Please let him be a regular to the show, and please make him remain loyal to Peter. I also love Kalinda. I am not sure why she hated Blake the first time she set eyes on him. Kalinda has a way of getting things done as well-she is great! I love Diane, and was sad when she revealed to Ely that she will be starting her own firm-I would hate to see them all split apart. On another note, I crack up to myself when they have that lady judge who insists that both parties answer their pleas & comments by saying: ""In my opinion"". I laughed at that one, and enjoy her ruling the courtroom on those days. Well to end this: ""In My Opinion"" this is one of the BEST shows on television. The Good Wife has GREAT: entertainment, drama, suspense and surprises around each corner and always has awesome endings.You also learn a few things when watching each court case. I am never bored when watching any scene, whether is the courtroom, the law firm, Alicia's home or even when they on occasion go for drinks: This is of course is ""IN MY OPINION"" LOL. Please writers, if you read this extra long review: Keep up the good work! AAA+ Show - Simply Love It!",/review/rw6918886/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2018,ambros-710-460987,5," Just average, are you easy to impress?
","This series is quite good, yet unfortunately it isn't that awesome like claimed by the most reviews here. The cast is attractive but good acting wasn't the priority in hiring. It is a big plus that there is a background plot. The cases of each episode aren't really good written and they try too hard to be heartwarming, sometimes it is even disgustingly sweet.
I rated it with five stars after watching all seasons completely because it is easy going and helps to get the illusion of a better place.
But if you are interested in court related series I strongly recommend The Practice and Boston Legal, maybe Ally McBeal, too. All of them are more trustworthy than The Good Wife.
Without the name Ridley Scott and lots of popular actors (all of them have seen better days) it would have been less than five stars.",/review/rw6918886/?ref_=tt_urv

","Pretty obvious that this show had no beginning, or a middle and an end, but a this series full of pace and adrenaline that provides viewers each episode the Wow effect. the ""good wife"" has an outstanding plot . The global ADHD we all suffer from makes it difficult for people to commit. The ego wants a commitment, the body wants quick fulfillment. ""It's not harassment, this inefficiency,"" says one of the officers to the hapless Carrie Agus in the beginning of sixth season. the series producers are effective in making viewers mouth gape in shock and ensure that they return the next chapter. Highly recommended for anyone who loves a scandal, courts and both of them together.",/review/rw6918886/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2010,conviction9,8," Simply Brilliant Drama
","I wouldn't say it's a perfect drama but it sure is entertaining and manages to capture my attention from beginning to end in every episode. Margulies is a great actress, no doubt about that, this show gives her the platform to showcase her acting prowess. The writers have done a good job inter-connecting the law and politics elements of the show, plus there's complicated relationships and family issues thrown in. The characters are all equally brilliant and interesting, my favorite is Panjabi's character the cynical private investigator Kalinda for which she deservingly won an emmy for. Do hope the writers keep up the good work would be a shame to see this be a 1 season wonder.",/review/rw6918886/?ref_=tt_urv

","The name doesn't do the justice for this series. I am glad that without knowing its name I watched one episode on TV while ironing my cloths, and searched to see what it was. IMO the love triangle is a great additive to make viewers follow all the important issues including (but not limited to) politics and the need for new rules about the ever growing technology that is affecting our daily lives and is clearly becoming more and more serious every day.",/review/rw6918886/?ref_=tt_urv
