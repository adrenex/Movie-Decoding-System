10 August 2006,imaginarytruths,5," Good intentions and some powerful moments but overall a disappointment
","I honestly didn't think it was very good at all, though I respect the intentions of the filmmakers. Whatever one wants to say about Oliver Stone, he showed a commitment to faithfully telling the story of these two Port Authority cops trapped in the wreckage of the World Trade Center and their worried wives.",/review/rw1447524/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2006,anhedonia,5," National tragedy as formula storytelling
","Something surprising happened while watching Oliver Stone's ""World Trade Center"" - I realized how much more I appreciated Paul Greengrass' ""United 93."" Greengrass' film was lean, stripped of any backstory for any of the characters. Very simply, it told what happened that horrible day on the plane - though he used some license - and didn't wallow in needless sentimentality.",/review/rw1447524/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2006,jmoney-2,9," A life-affirming movie about courage

21 August 2020,briancham1994,6," Drawn out
",This film is a mostly compelling story of the 9/11 attacks but the problem is that it's too drawn out. There is a lot of the time when nothing much is really happening. It tries to focus on the lives of particular individuals who are portrayed as heroes but this also means that there is not much material to work with.,/review/rw1447524/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2006,ccrivelli2005,8," Stone Salutes
","Oliver Stone salutes the ordinary heroes of this extraordinary circumstances. He puts himself way behind their stories, so far behind in fact that he is almost imperceptible. In Italy, the academics, snobs and other fauna dismissed it as rhetoric and banal. I have the words of the laid back ""opinionist"" Barbara Pallombelli accusing Stone of ""inventing"" How silly really. The ignorance between the cultures seems insurmountable sometimes. The story was told by the two men under the rubble and their families. They were working people, not professional ""opinionists"". They will hum the theme from Startsky and Hutch to keep themselves alive. I wonder what pseudo intellectual would have done.The film is a gripping depiction centered mostly on two men and their families. The event caused a catastrophe that is still growing, based mostly in personal interest and massive inter cultural ignorance. The film is not about that. The film is about the tiniest enormity of the domestic drama. I wept and longed for a private happy ending. The rest, well the rest is still part of our daily existence. Most of the detractors accuse World Trade Center of not being an Oliver Stone film, if he had done a classic Oliver Stone film he would have been accused of that. Stone will be controversial even for standing still. My hat to you Mr Stone, please keep going your own way.",/review/rw1447524/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2006,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," As emotionally disturbing it was to watch, it ended up being an incredible surprise of a great film
","When I first heard of this movie being made, I had so many debates about this film, I almost hated Oliver Stone, after all, we just had only the 5 year anniversary of 9/11. I thought he was going to make some action movie of a horrifying and nightmarish event that is still fresh in most of our memories. So, I refused to see this film, but a girl at my work told me that it wasn't like what we both expected at all and that it was a great film. So, my friend and I decided to see it, I have to say that it was beautifully done and showed great respect for that horrible day.",/review/rw1447524/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2006,LAKERS34,9," Straightforward Approach Works for Stone
","There will of course inevitably be films made about 9-11 and they will no doubt take many different approaches in telling their stories. This film, the second major effort at depicting the 9-11 attacks, approaches the story head-on, literally from Ground Zero, from the viewpoint of some of those most directly involved in the incident: Rescue Workers. The fact that this film was directed by Oliver Stone was/is a surprise. The film is benign in the sense that it does not postulate about what happened that day and why, which is not your typical Stone movie. Instead, it takes its time telling an intimate story about a group of Rescue Workers caught up in the collapse of the World Trade Center towers and their battle to survive/escape an unimaginable hell.",/review/rw1447524/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2006,vlahov,1," Total and big disappointment! Non-American viewers, beware!
","First, I vote 1 for this dreadful piece of celluloid just because IMDb hadn't provided negative votes yet. Absolutely big disappointment coming from one of the finest directors of all time - Oliver Stone. Having in mind that he directed such masterpieces as JFK and Naturally born killers, I have no excuse for him making such blatant propaganda movie except for the paycheck. Every single clich√© you name it, you have it here. Patriotism is flowing from every possible hole, the opposite of smart Bush showing like a cockroaches from every frame. Yes, for sure, Americans do deserve to have such idiotic film made for such tragic event, so let them have it. A apropos, when do we have movie about more than half million innocent civilians killed in Iraq by Americans? For all those women and children cold-heartedly slaughtered and maimed by American soldiers and not even statistically put as collateral damages? A movie about how the US invasion of Iraq provoked and increased the uniting of the world terrorism in that poor country? Where is THAT movie, mister Stone?",/review/rw1447524/?ref_=tt_urv

24 March 2008,loufalce,1," A Pile of Rubble
","Awful ""docudrama"" concerning 2 cops who get buried under tons of rubble on 9-11. How dare Oliver Stone- who was quoted as saying America had it coming- make a movie to exploit this tragedy. Has America become so desensitized to the violence of the real world that we make films to exploit tragedies for the sake of entertainment? This and the earlier Flight 93 were the first- and hopefully the last films to capitalize on this tragedy. They died early deaths at the box office and it is easy to see why. As far as WTC is concerned, it does feature an average performance from Cage, and the rest of the no-name cast simply functions as a prop to support the paper thin screenplay. Needless to say, it is chock full of errors and anachronisms, but it is an Oliver Stone film, right? Beyond bad, this film is a slap in the face and an insult to anyone who either survived or died on 9-11. Exploitative garbage, pure and simple.Zero stars.",/review/rw1447524/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2006,kyle-florence,7," A surprisingly good film
","I went into this film without expectations. I saw Flight 93 and enjoyed it and I am very interested in all events surrounding September 11th, so this film appealed to me. Now, I must say that I am not an Oliver Stone fan, however, upon hearing this movie was nothing like an Oliver Stone film I decided to check it out.",/review/rw1447524/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2006,dianajay,8," Very Well Done Movie!!! With No Political Agenda...
","We weren't sure whether or not we would want to see this movie. Oliver Stone is someone who's movies we don't usually agree with. After reading many of the reviews on this site, we decided to give this movie a chance.",/review/rw1447524/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2006,mstomaso,7," Surprising in many respects *MILD SPOILER*
","There seems to be a great deal of confusion in the varied interpretations presented here on IMDb about what this movie attempts to depict. This is not about 9/11, nor is it about heroism, nor is it about terrorism, nor politics. This is, remarkably, a very simple story about survival, the will to live, and the responsibility that goes along with being human. There are a number of nuanced sub-themes (all of those listed above) as well, and the most important of these, from my unique perspective (and I welcome contrary opinions as opposed to labeling them WRONG), is the power of love.",/review/rw1447524/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2006,virek213,10," Hollywood Deals With 9/11 On Realistic And Human Terms
","It is unlikely that any film, documentary or otherwise, can depict the horrors of September 11, 2001 with the same kind of accuracy as those who were direct witness to the nightmare. But this year, Hollywood has shown a willingness to tackle 9/11 from a deeply human perspective, first through the TV film FLIGHT 93, then Paul Greengrass' excellent feature film UNITED 93, and now through director Oliver Stone's WORLD TRADE CENTER.",/review/rw1447524/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2021,romaniederreveaux,10," A whole new perspective
","After reading all the negative reviews here, I started watching the movie with no high expectations. However, I was very surprised by the way the facts were presented! The story is about 2 policemen who get stuck under the rubble. Only 20 people were rescued alive from the rubble. The policewoman we see in the film are numbers 18 and 19. During the film, the focus is not on the crash, like most movies, but on the hopeless survival. The focus is also on the families of those involved. These two insights provide a new perspective on a well-known event. For me this was a top film based on testimonials and stories of the survivors.",/review/rw1447524/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2006,hugodinwitty,1," A classless play on emotions
","I know that many people who don't like this movie say so just because they thought it was made at an inappropriate time. Personally, I hated this movie on its own merit as poor film-making. It seems that Oliver Stone just decided he wanted to make a movie, any movie, about 9/11, and didn't care about the content of the movie. The end result was a movie of such pitiful quality that one could go though the script and replace the term ""police officer"" with ""miner"" and ""World Trade Center"" with ""a coal mine"" and the entire script would work perfectly as a cave-in disaster movie. It's that generic. Stone tries to carry the movie just by showing how sad the families were and how scared the policemen were, meanwhile allowing the audience no interesting plot points to hold on to, nor any significance to the tragedy. In the end, I have to conclude that Oliver Stone just wanted to get some cheap emotional reactions from the crowd, because at one point the movie says that it is about the potential for good in humanity and how strong we can be in the face of adversity. Stone quickly forgets this, because only about 15% of the movie even shows people coming together to help one another. The other 85% of the movie is spent watching the families argue or seeing flashbacks to their happy memories, which is a good way to get audience reaction but hardly lends any significance or depth to the plot. I don't in any way want to belittle the pain that these families had to endure, which is why I am disappointed that that pain was exploited to make a bad movie. September 11 was the most important and tragic event in my lifetime, and I think it deserves more respect than to be made into a generic, poorly-written disaster movie less than five years after it happened.",/review/rw1447524/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2006,imajestr,7," A Great Drama
","I saw an advanced screening of World Trade Center last night, and I was very impressed. I went into it unbiased, deciding that I would indeed like to hear the story of what happened to the two officers this movie is about, and I would take it for what it is, regardless of whether or not people think it's still too soon.",/review/rw1447524/?ref_=tt_urv

","I knew this was going to be utter hail America bull even before watching it. We have a club of 10 people, who regularly attend the theaters and watch random movies. Believe me, if I had a choice, I would have never had any interest in watching this. But anyway, as I predicted, well as we all predicted, actually, we were bored through the whole film. Except for those moments where we along with the rest of the theater were laughing at especially the marine and the other cheesy moments in this disaster of a film. When it was finally over, people just stood outside laughing at how bad the film was and talking about this marine, who wanted to dig through tons of rubble with his super fantastic American marine knife!! ""Don't worry, I won't leave you! I'm a marine!"" Yes! He actually says that! And then we are told, that he goes to Iraq for 2 years to get revenge. I ask then, was he one of those enraged psychos who raped Iraqi women and murdered their families down there then ? And what has Iraq to do with WTC ? What a joke.",/review/rw1447524/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2018,lewishamilton-35961,," A reminder of that fateful day.
","This is an excellent film on a very touchy subject. World Trade Center makes an excellent companion piece to United 93. The films have different styles and they present diverse perspectives of a day that has limitless faces. Both are thoughtful, intelligent, and emotionally potent. They provoke and challenge, asking us not only to face our memories but to question our future. By being less political than he has ever been, Stone offers a movie that can be embraced by movie-goers who sit on the left side of the theater, in the center, or on the right. It's an achievement, and it makes one hope that future feature films about 9/11 will exhibit the same mix of dramatic force and tasteful restraint.",/review/rw1447524/?ref_=tt_urv

10 August 2006,gorgeous_blackman,1," It had no message, so I loved it! Go America! Pass me another Budweiser!
","If you liked this movie, you might be a redneck. Leave it up to the citizens of an oblivious, myopic, imperialist country like ours to love a movie that ""redeems"" the events of September 11. Leave it up to such citizens to like a movie because it does NOT make a political comment, or any other kind of comment, and is, instead, a story of courage and the ""triumph"" of the ""human spirit."" How very refreshing. It all reminds me of the sarcastic musings of a Beckett character, who says that before he dies, he hopes to become more able to find ""the good in the bad, the bad in the worse."" People, if we're always finding the mote of hope in the sea of tragedy, then why should we consider ANYTHING a tragedy? The reactions most people have to this movie are a symptom of a disease--and they are a hint that September 11 has basically changed nothing about the way we think about the world. They are a sign that ""it"" will probably happen AGAIN. So--go watch this flick, crunch your popcorn, shed a few sappy tears, then get back into your Hummer, fill up with 70 bucks of gas, run over a few homeless people (why can't they just get a job?!), and continue about your day.",/review/rw1447524/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2006,dukefan1971,9," The second of two excellent 9/11 films
","Normally, I am not a fan of Oliver Stone, having only slightly liked a few of his films. I also know about his penchant for conspiracy-spouting in his films, and I took that with me into the film. What I saw, however, was a truly inspirational, realistic, and gritty film that left me in awe of the two brave men depicted in the film, and how the extraordinary events of a day that will forever be in our memories affected even the most normal of people. I have also seen United 93, which was an incredibly realistic and powerful film. Thankfully for myself and every other viewer of World Trade Center, Mr. Stone left his conspiracy soapbox at home, and presented another film about 9/11 in the same vein as that earlier film. It doesn't present anyone as a hero--just a bunch of ordinary people caught up in one of the worst losses of life in our nation's history. However, by the end of the film, you learn that there is a hero in all people, and that when called upon by circumstances, everyday people can become truer superheroes than any comic book character ever was. I highly recommend this film to everyone, though its more graphic sequences may be unsuitable for younger viewers (under 13). In fact, I think both this and United 93 should be required viewing for anyone who wants to understand why this--like Pearl Harbor for my grandparents and JFK's assassination for my parents--is the day my generation will remember exactly where each one of them was when it happened. For those who died, we can not--should not--ever forget.",/review/rw1447524/?ref_=tt_urv
