13 June 2017,redproton88,10," Great So Far - Ignore the 1 star reviews
","I truly do not understand all the negativity and one star reviews of this show. I don't write a lot of reviews, but felt compelled to when I saw the low rating and negative reviews.",/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2017,paulashton001,10," Under rated and totally top notch.
","Like the tragically cancelled Roadies I'm Dying Up Here has not received it's due praise. It's funny and touching examination of the lives of upcoming comedians masks the true magic of the show, which is to relate universal struggle all of us face in trying to realize our future potential while nurturing healthy relationships and balancing responsibilities right now. Shooting for the top before fizzling out or exploding. Reconciling our past with our present. ",/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2017,StarIsBorn,10," Please Renew I'm Dying Up Here
","As I never saw promotion for this series, I started watching it when I stumbled upon it one night during what was the 5th episode. I immediately had to go back and watch the first 4 episodes. Having lived through this time, I see a lot in this series that seems familiar, bringing back memories of a quite different time. Anyone who doesn't get this show does not realize it is portraying the 70's! A lot of jokes from then do not translate well today but they are telling it like it is, or was. Ron's storyline reminded me of when Jerry Seinfeld actually had a bit part on Benson. A lot of great comics evolved during this period. I believe this show is not meant to be ""haha"" funny, but to show the struggles of those who make us laugh. Love the cast they do a superb job! Hope Showtime gives this show a 2nd season, a better time slot, and promotes it this time!",/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2017,bleachedlabel,9," Brilliant and genuine
","Stand-up is experiencing a renaissance and ""I'm Dying Up Here"" is the blueprint for building a masterful comedic series. This is the real deal. the show represents the period with authenticity, the plot and jokes are intelligent, thought provoking, engaging, and most of all -- funny, the characters have real depth and the comedians take it to another level by delivering brilliant performances as actors. Showtime has a hit on their hands.",/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2018,kirbylee70-599-526179,8," COMEDY IS NOT PRETTY
","More prophetic words were never written than these, ""Comedy is not Pretty"", when they adorned the cover of Steve Martin's third album. While most of us see the laughter inducing antics or hear the howl inducing words that comics offer the reality behind the scenes is not near as fun as one would think. It's a dog eat dog world and was that even more so in the heyday of the stand-up comic in the early 70s. And the one place that was the mecca for comedians during this time period was L.A. ",/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2017,Anita_V,8," Keep watching!
","When I started watching the show, it didn't seem great, I was a bit disappointed, but a few episodes in I felt it had started to move in the right direction so I kept watching. 7 episodes in I'm starting to love it, the characters seem more real, their stories more interesting and it's a lot funnier. I just hope there will be more seasons.",/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2017,astraltomb,8," Criminally Underrated!
","This show was an incredibly realistic portrayal of the 70's and it's criminally underrated by lame sources like Rotten Tomatoes (probably because it's very non-PC and shows an authentic dose of how much more crass social dialogue was back in the day aka lots of racial slurs). There are definitely moments of hilarity, but just because it is about comedians does not mean it's meant to just be a comedy show...it deals with lots of dark themes we all face in every day life (addiction, death, depression, failure...etc). Excellent show, can't wait for Season 2 because by the end of this last episode I was left wanting more and finally feeling intimately connected to each character.",/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2017,cjkatwork,9," This isn't a comedy, its a period drama.....and a damn good one!
",Its not Vinyl. There are no similarities to that show other than it's set in the 70s. Its pretty clear that most of the reviews here are from people that didn't bother to watch a full episode.,/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2017,haslentz,10," Entertaining, addictive and very authentic
","After a 'first career' in ordinary work, I decided to take a fling at stand-up comedy at the Comedy Zone in Jacksonville Florida for a second life. It's a major club that draws ""A-list"" comics from L.A. And NYC for the Thursday-Sunday shows. Us rank neophytes are given the opportunity to do 5-12 minutes on a Tuesday-Wednesday, and we learn from the local club owner who is a national booker of comic talent. We had to pay and complete an 8 week class, and then meet the standard in our 'graduation show' to be part of the team. About half make it. ",/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2018,jimmyjoe583,9," Good Work
",Easily some of the best TV being produced. Kudos to all involved.,/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2019,larry_b,9," Sadly cancelled :(
",What a marvellous show this was. I particularly like the 70s era. Very sadly cancelled. Too much rubbish for viewers to choose from instead of tuning into quality productions like this one...,/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2017,Songwriter_90210,7," Great writing, good acting, fair pace
","From the opening music, you understand there is a pall over this show. No, it's not a comedy, and the telling of jokes over the melancholy (borderline depressing) jazz riffs that begin each episode aptly explains exactly what this is. This is a glimpse into the hard life of comedians, and dammit, they aren't pulling any punches. ",/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2018,biancachristie-803-885566,8," Much Better Than I Expected
","I just finished a two-day binge of the first two seasons of I'm Dying Up Here. To be honest, I approached it with pretty low expectations, so maybe that's one reason why I came away liking the show so much. The pilot really doesn't do justice to the rest of the show--and that's a good thing, because I would always rather watch a show hit its stride and get better than watch it go downhill.

20 October 2020,leetommo,10," Why oh why did they pull this show
","You've definitely got to have some sort of comical education to appreciate this show. This history behind the comedy store is one thing but having that comedy mindset and understanding of the clever narrative of this show is a must. Possibly why it wasn't so popular on the mainstream. This show was awesome, refreshing, clever and an articulate comedy. I loved it.",/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2019,nategerard,8," The Cancellation is Tragic
",I'm disappointed in Showtine for pulling the plug on this witty trip back to the early days of stand up.,/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2017,timetobelievefoundation,9," 'Comedy' is the truth
","'Comedy' is the truth I would give it a 10 but i want to leave room for the one... I'm Dying up here'' is a blast from the past in so many ways. You don't normally see what is behind it all in this business and what a struggling aspiring artist goes through and this one nailed it on the head!!! I am not shocked at what this profession has to go through and endure, all dignity put aside and pride to hide...it really is a tough road to fame fortune and glory and all that jazz to what a person goes through to achieve it all. When i was watching this my impression was it all seems very realistic down to earth. Unveils secrets and guess what its all good nobody who's made it is complaining 'Comedy' is the truth. Behind all of the madness is the joy of giving and receiving that so called gift of laughter which is a temporary fix like band-aid healing experience that works for everyone. a two way experience receiving the turn around, of your pains into joys and laughter ",/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2020,TheGal_010,10," Give us a Season 3!!
","I bought into every character in this series. They were believable in their grittiness, their heartbreaks and their triumphs. But Dammit, we need more.
An extremely well put together mingling of the characters and their life struggles, past and present.
But this series is worthy of another season. All the characters bloomed to their potential by the end of the second season. A third season could be explosive.
I have encouraged many people to watch this masterful portrayal of the dark side of comic's lives. Seriously, by the end of the last episode of the second season, we all feel like we were left 'Dying Up Here' for more.",/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2017,cherold,8," So far I'm liking the sharp wit and the characters
","After reading a couple of reviews, I wasn't sure I wanted to watch this series at all. The basic thrust of the reviews was this was a show where characters tell jokes onstage but offstage you are trapped in their drab, humorless lives of desperation.",/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2018,booksoup101,10," I love this show.
","This show, I'm Dying Up Here, is pitch perfect. The writing, the acting, the character development and the music are all perfect, plus if you are a fan of Stand Up Comedy this is to not be missed. I really hope this show goes for at least 10 seasons. Not to repeat myself but the casting for this series is right on the money perfect.",/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2017,syncopatedrhythm,1," Doomed
","I'm Dying Up Here meet Vinyl, Vinyl meet I'm Dying Up Here. Same show, same problems, same fate awaits it. Distorted view of the 70's decor and fashion. You don't need to pound us over the head to remind us it is the 70's. I lived thru the 70's and not everything was groovy or mod. Stop filming with the 70's filter. My 4K TV says it's 2017. Same problem with too many characters you just won't care about. Don't waste your time with this like I did with Vinyl only to have it cancelled.",/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2021,lyricalwhip,10," I Was Not Expecting To Be Moved By This Drama
","This drama provides a gritty, bittersweet, and
unadulterated glance into the entertainment industry from the perspective of group of comedians. The actors truly brought the characters they played to life. Like most artists on the come up, there are no bells and whistles to jump out at you and immediately grab your attention. It gradually unfolds and is just there for you to watch. This show deserved more publicity. Which is the same point the comedians tried to prove to themselves.",/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2018,drael64,6," Single lensed downbeat drama
","There's a few things that you should know about this before heading in. Firstly, it's mot particularly funny. There's a few scenes that might amuse, but both the stand up bits and the humour in the show is pretty juvenile. It amounts to ""your mum"" jokes, racial observation (black people say so and so), and fairly basic sexual humour. Perhaps this is an accurate reflection of how comedy has evolved, but really don't expect to chuckle.",/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2017,cekadah,9," Great TV series
","I truly enjoyed this series! Everything about it was spot on - the clothes, the interiors, the attitudes, the jokes, the script.",/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2018,verocruz05,9," Binge worthy!
","I would know. I have binge watched both seasons 3 times! 
The writing, the acting, the cinematography, the costume the sets......all are perfect. Compelling story telling. I got attached to majority of the characters and crave so much more knowledge on the characters backgrounds and future experiences. 
Please I beg of showtime to renew and give us Season 3!!",/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2017,amolad-1,3," Pretty bad -- READ the book
","This show is awful. It'a hard enough to write a show about comedians. You have to write jokes--and funny ones--weekly if you insist on showing the comedians on stage. This show can't do it. Based very loosely on Bill Knoedelseder's terrific book about The Comedy Store and the comedians who eventually went on strike because they weren't getting paid, this really pale imitation takes place a good six years before the events Knoedelseder wrote about. It's just not interesting. Did I mention it wasn't funny? Whoever compared this to HBO's Vinyl was right on the money. It's doomed. Also, the comment about how the show uses every 70s cliché in the book was also correct. The only thing this show is very good at is showing what a terrible person ""Goldie""--Mitzi Shore--is. Do yourself a favor. Read Knoedelseder's book. It's about a thousand times better and, unlike this series, you really feel for the people in it.",/review/rw3733000/?ref_=tt_urv
