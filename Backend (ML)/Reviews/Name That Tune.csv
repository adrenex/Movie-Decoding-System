13 August 2017,kingbk-2,9," A Surprisingly Strong Remake of an 80s Classic
","I went into yesterday waiting for the DuckTales reboot skeptical. Many times when something is relaunched, it's not nearly as good as expected. However, I must say that the new DuckTales is quite good, perhaps, dare I say, even better than the original. There are some things I like better off the bat. The animation is much higher quality now than it was in the 80s. It's fluid, it's clean and it has a comic book feel to it that gives a nice nod to Carl Barks and his original creation. Also, I like that Huey, Dewey and Louie are given actual individual personalities. In the original, they were pretty much interchangeable. This one, each has a unique appearance and demeanor. Webby is also much better in this one. The writing is strong. A great mix of humor, adventure and character development. Having Donald Duck as a main character is great and adds new dimensions to the show. The only thing early on that really bugged me was the new voice of Scrooge. I know that Alan Young has passed away, but it's going to take some time to get used to this new voice. In defense, I do like the characterization of Scrooge, so once I get used to the voice, it shouldn't be bad either. The other voice actors are great. You can tell they hired some big names to help with this show. This reboot is high quality and has a ton of potential. I look forward to seeing how it unfolds once it goes on the regular schedule. Bravo Disney!",/review/rw5232065/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2017,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,10," Nevermind the naysayers... the new ""DuckTales"" is loving reboot that in every way lives up to the outstanding original!
","The fundamental problems with living in an age of seemingly endless reboots, remakes and re-treads is the simple fact that people get burned out. And when people get burned out, they begin to dissect, dismiss and demean those rare but invaluable examples of reboots done right, just out of a misplaced sense of moral superiority. Case in point- 2017's ""DuckTales"", a retelling of the classic cartoon series that started thirty years back in 1987. Having grown up alongside the original series, I get it. Our nostalgia is a beloved part of our lives, and nothing could ever possibly measure up to sky-high expectations... Especially not in this case... right? ...right?",/review/rw5232065/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2017,MelloMovieReviewReturns,," Woo-oo! This is how you Reboot! (Spoilers)
","The small details, Scrooge McDuck is so cheap he still uses a flip-phone. The cameo of Roxanne, Max's Girlfriend from ""A Goofy Movie"" the heart of the story is the same. ",/review/rw5232065/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2017,Nerdfury,10," A fantastic and faithful reboot that goes even better.
","I grew up on the old Disney universe cartoons, before they started getting weird with mid-nineties and beyond. Your classics, like DuckTales, Chip 'n Dale, TaleSpin, and Darkwing Duck.",/review/rw5232065/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2017,ericstevenson,10," So far so awesome
","Looking at the kid's cartoon of the 1980's, I believe that this website lists ""DuckTales"" as having the highest score of any cartoon of the entire decade and looking back, I certainly agree. I remember owning VHS tapes of the original show when I was really little. I recall seeing the new intro for the show which fortunately kept the same theme song which is among the catchiest of all time. The animation style is all brand new but it's still authentic to the original series. Having seen just the first two episodes, I'm blown away at how amazing they are. Thank you, Disney XD for another great show! ",/review/rw5232065/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2017,annonymouscritic,8," Faithful to the original, clever, and funny.
","Even though I've only seen 10 episodes of the original series, I really enjoyed watching them. So when watching this reboot I did have high expectations unlike everyone else, and I was also afraid that it might suck badly because most reboots in recent years have been borderline trash. This reboot is not trash, not even close. It stays faithful to the original series, has great writing, and the jokes constantly hit. I've seen a few people complain about the art style and honestly, it's actually really good and fits well with the new comic book style the series is taking. The voice acting is better than the original (although Alan Young as Scrooge in the original is still brilliant) and I love David Tennant as Scrooge. He fits the character so well and does such a great job. Even though we only have two episodes so far, they are two episodes that I adored and I'm pretty sure fans of the original series will love this just as much, if not more than the original. The animation is gorgeous as well. It isn't choppy and is actually really fluid and the original Pac-Man shaped black eyes for the pupils are a very nice touch. Overall, this is a great reboot and you should watch it right now. Great job all around, can't wait for new episodes!",/review/rw5232065/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2018,trebordjackson,6," I have very mixed feelings about this
","1. It's pretty funny sometimes 2. It's not very rewatchable when a show has arcs you get bored with episodes you already watched You feel been there done that I like episodic cartoons better 3. I hate that characters often get pushed to the side and get neglected by the writers. I guess this is an unfortunate side effect of Giving the kids new personalities they often upstage the adults 4. The art is ok I understand that they had to separate it from the original but it takes some getting used to 5. When they tried to give the tripplets more depth they made them less fun. Huey is just boring a sterotypical nerd is a good character but they don't do anything with him he is just kinda there, and there is Dewy Scrappy Doo in a Duck's body, Louie the only tripplet that gets funny lines probably because he is rude mean and selfish. There is Launch pad he's ok just not that funny, and there is Webby She is tough, smart brave and funny but she also has no social skills, There is Mrs.Beakly she is old and grumpy and tough, there is Uncle Scrooge the best character 6) I absolutely hate what they did to Donald he went from being a Short tempered, mischievous, loud mouth, with a good heart deep down to this pathetic sad sack, that is scared of everything. He went from Bart Simpson to Milhouse. They also make him do toned down slapstick gags because they perfer to have the characters stand around and talk like King of the Hill but they have to because he is Donald.",/review/rw5232065/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2020,planktonrules,9," Try to get your kids to watch this one!
","When my kids were little, there were some really good cartoons that I enjoyed watching with them, such as ""Pinky and the Brain"", ""Animaniacs"" and ""Freakazoid"". Watching these cartoons with them wasn't a chore like it was when they watched the likes of ""Muppet Babies"" (uggh!!) and many of the more insipid cartoons. Why do I mention this? Because I see the reboot of ""DuckTales"" to be similar...a cartoon that adults AND kids can both enjoy. This is because the show is exquisitely well written--with many clever references to various Disney shows and some very intelligently written plots. I particularly love seeing the Glomgold episodes...especially the one where he took over the show (complete with his own theme song). Overall, a clever and fun show...and one you should try to get your kids interested in seeing, as otherwise you might have to watch it alone.",/review/rw5232065/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2019,CallEmLikeISeeEm,10," Very Impressive Reboot !!
","I've always been a massive Scrooge McDuck/Carl Barks/Don Rosa superfan. Additionally, I was a kid when the original Ducktales series graced our Saturday morning television sets. I won't lie; I was very skeptical that Disney would live up to the original Ducktales cartoons and the Barks/Rosa classic comics.",/review/rw5232065/?ref_=tt_urv

",'Ducktales (2017)' the series remake of the late 1980's series of the same name is wonderful.,/review/rw5232065/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2017,derikdragon01,10," It made me quack up
","Expectations aside, the first episode was pretty good. It was cool, that the writers gave nods to Talespin, Goof Troop and especially Darkwing Duck. However if DW is part of this later on (either closer to the original, or slightly modified), it might be interesting to see where it takes him.",/review/rw5232065/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2019,hxzr-18144,1," Can still watch old series from 1988s instead of this torture.
","Same is the opinion of my kid who is same age today, as I was around 1988..
With greed for money, content quality degrades.
Investors just want ROI !!!!
Screwing the feelings which goes with imaginary stuff in SPECIALLY entertainment industry..
Disney is failing majorly in many aspects, there OLD content (though low on animations) but had awesome content..",/review/rw5232065/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2019,seansohr,1," Opinions are opinions, you know.
","And it is my opinion is that the revival is an absolute disgrace to the original. The animation is dumbed down to Adobe Flash, the ducklings no longer speak like the other ducks and instead speak like everyday humans do which is just so lifeless and unimaginative when compared to how they sounded in the 1987 classic.",/review/rw5232065/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2019,veinctor,2," A horrid remake
","I loved the duck comics, especial by Carl Barks and I adored the original Ducktales for their decent stories, magical music, good pacing and faithful characters (after episode 70 the quality started to decline). So let's talk about the reboot after I watched all the 1st season and 2x14 just to see if I still believe the same things.",/review/rw5232065/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2020,renegadeviking-271-528568,10," Better then the original
","The characters of DuckTales have an extended history dating back to the original show as well as the Scrooge McDuck comicbooks. Family plays a crucial role and sets the foundation for the show. Huey (my guy, Danni Pudi), Duey (Ben Schwartz), and Louie (Bobby Moynihan) each have a vastly different and distinct personality that sets them apart from one another this time around. They're all still adventurous troublemakers at heart.",/review/rw5232065/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2018,OzzyZikeFan1057,1," The proper title should be ""DuckSmells""!
","I'll try my best to be fair. I get the idea that old-fashioned animation is costly, and it takes a long time to create. However, don't we have the technology to replicate the same character designs as we have seen in the 2000s and in the few decades prior? (Disney themselves proved that when they made the animated short ""Paper Man."") The animation and character designs are a giant eyesore!",/review/rw5232065/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2017,pachomar84,10," Created an account just for this
","As a fan of the original series (yes, I'm 33) I gotta say this is an awesome reboot. The characters are well revamped for 30 years later. There's the original opening (one of my favorites ever) All characters are there (some of them appearing episode by episode) and the inclusion of Donald makes it more fun I'm not ashamed to say this i one of the best animated reboot done, and I gladly watch which which some laughter from nostalgia Definitely recommended for old fans and new fans!",/review/rw5232065/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2017,markusabrahamssonpersonligen,10," Smarter Than The Smarties, To Say The Least!
","I've seen some reviews ranting about how this show isn't faithful to the original and too much has changed in the reboot. I however strongly disagree. The reboot is very faithful to the original, without repeating the exact same formula as the original had. All of the characters, including the triplets and Webby, now have their own personality.",/review/rw5232065/?ref_=tt_urv

27 July 2020,thatcrazaychicken,2," Extremely disappointing reboot !
","I really tried to like this one after hearing it being lauded as the best cartoon reboot in a while but despite a few minor pluses it fails spectacularly in capturing me as a fan.
Characters: The characters feel closer to the Quackpack than any original telling of Hewey, Dewey and Louie . Webby is now an obnoxious Mary Sue that feels like Disney Channel weirdly apologizing to people that didn't like Mabel Pines from Gravity Falls so they made a more sellable bland irritant that won't ruffle feathers . Scrooge is still ok and well voiced as well as Donald though . The side characters don't grab my attention enough and feel forced when they're from other properties.",/review/rw5232065/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2018,dantonjames,4," Not in the spirit of Ducktales
","The first thing that struck me as the fact that I couldn't understand a single word Donald Duck says. That's not good when characters are unintelligible. Then I was taken aback at how much of a jerk people are. Scrooge is a scornful, mean spirited jerk, voiced by a squeaky ex-timelord. How I miss the soothing, seasoned tones of Alan Young. I just don't much like it, made me start watching the original again, though, so that's a plus.",/review/rw5232065/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2019,kathy84,2," Beyond disappointing
","I really wanted to like this show when it premiered. I grew up with the original which was very high quality in every respect, the drawings, animation, voices etc. So I was expecting this to be like that. Instead what they give us is a really cheaply made show. The drawings are crude and badly done, the animation doesn't flow like the original show. Its lame attempts at humor are much less timeless than the original's material. Even the voices sound like pale imitations of the originals. I even tried watching it again more recently more objectively, and I still think the same thing as I did when it first started. I have to agree with the other critical reviews on here. Disney can and should have done much better. If they can still do a good job on their animated movies then they shouldn't be so cheap and obviously not trying on their tv shows.",/review/rw5232065/?ref_=tt_urv
