26 September 2022,danieljfarthing,6," A soft, schmaltzy but passable rom-com, lacking the 'edge' of the best in the genre
","The BEST rom-coms have a dark edge (""Destination Wedding"", ""Meet Cute"", ""Always Be My Maybe"", ""Palm Springs"", etc) but some with NO edge get by (just) on the 'charm' of their leads (without which they'd be Hallmark sludge)... like ""About Fate"". Emma Roberts & Thomas Mann are likeable twenty-something strangers who on New Years Eve Eve (warning: it's a festive movie) are SUPPOSED to get engaged to their respective ill-suited partners Lewis Tan & Madelaine Petsch... but 'fate' (or 'serendipity'? - no, THAT rom-com had more edge too) has other plans for this perfect pair. It's soft & schmaltzy fare, but for the right audience, it is passable.",/review/rw8743869/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2022,paindweller,10," wonderful heart felt film
",Roberts is a really good actor who seems to get better as time passes. The film was light hearted without vulgarity nudity with a half decent storyline. Nowadays it's almost impossible finding anything even partly worth watching so this was pleasant. All the characters did a good job. It's more of a 7 than a 10 yet gets the high score due to the unfair rating on here. The story was actually interesting as you initially get the feeling that it's been done before yet then your pleasantly suprised. It also doesn't have the typical cliches most romance films have which gave it a nice twist. Watch for a cool sweet romance to make you smile.,/review/rw8743869/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2022,trinaboice,6," Super hokey but offers solid performances by the cast
","IN A NUTSHELL:
This romantic comedy is a tale of two people who believe in love, but seem to never be able to find its true meaning. In a wild twist of events, fate puts each in the other's path on a stormy New Year's Eve, as comedy and chaos ensue.",/review/rw8743869/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2022,alesaenz-48003,10," My favorite romantic film of 2022
","Maybe I can't be objective about this movie since I love Emma Roberts but I am grateful that she decided to make this film since I jumped to watch it because she is on it, calling this as fate that I watch this film and definitely is already my favorite romantic movie of 2022. The charming script possess a vibe from the 80's and even the 90's, having that kind of unforgetable moments. Thomas Mann was a good call since he makes great chemistry with Emma Roberts where both are like complementary of each other but also sharing key elements such as same favorite movie, same kind of pet, for not saying cool surprises. It's set on New Year's Eve so it's an excellent choice to watch on xmas season but I can tell that it's totally fine to watch anytime of the year. Highly recommended.",/review/rw8743869/?ref_=tt_urv

15 September 2022,jackblack1,10," Fantastic romcom!
","This one reminds me of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan classics! I miss movies like this, it makes you believe in humanity again. All those fake Netflix romcoms are nothing compared to this film. There's actual chemistry between the leads, there's actual humor and plot twists, there's actual magic that you feel while watching this movie - which is the whole point of romcoms! Yes, it does stick to the formula and, yes, you know how it's going to end, but it's the journey that matters. This film feels fresh because the writing is witty, dialogue pops, characters are believable and there's an emotional climax at the end that money just can't buy. Beautifully shot , well paced and tastefully scored this film gives out the classic holiday vibe. It is an audience pleaser and there's no shame in that, personally, I got way more than my money's worth.",/review/rw8743869/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2022,zentist-563-976986,5," Not a touch on the original
","This is a run of the mill romantic comedy with very few funny moments. It´s major plus is that it inspired me to watch the original Russian movie from 1975. I will make a separate comment on that movie, but suffice it to say it was much better than this one.",/review/rw8743869/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2022,jamesjustice-92,4," Far-fetched fate
","Once upon a time a very talented guy named Eldar Ryazanov had made a little movie called ""Irony of fate"" back in 1975 in Soviet Russia and it became an instant hit, so much so, that even after 45+ years people still watch it every New Year's eve on television - it has become a tradition. Many of those people quote this movie by heart, and the names of its characters have become household: if you stop a person on the street and ask who Ippolit is you would get an answer right away. Unless you're a youngster who doesn't respect classics.",/review/rw8743869/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2022,arthur_tafero,5," Mundane ROM-COM - About Fate
","A clever pun does not make for an entertaining film. About Fate is a clever pun, and the film is entertaining to a degree, but only to a degree. It is not a top-notch ROM-COM, but amazingly enough, even at a 5 star out of 10 rating, it is still in the upper 30% of films from 2022. This is a sad commentary on the number of poor films mass-produced during this year. A New Year's Eve party (which traditionally has a cleansing effect on millions of lukewarm romances) makes for a new game plan for our two lovers. This has happened to me as well, a long time ago. The protagonists discover they are much hotter together than their current partners. Go for it.",/review/rw8743869/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2022,Tayyasqueen,2," Dumb
","Unrealistic and cheesy movie. Strange for such decent actors to play in a movie like this. Painful to watch, and yet I somehow made it through. Visually it was well made. The actors did a fair job with what they were working with. Those are the only compliments I can give. The script/writing is poorly done. It's like a mix between a Hallmark movie and a big production, wanna be romantic comedy. The whole time I was wishing for it to be over. I'm surprised by the people that think this is such a well-made, quality film. The movie could have been done so much better! Too over the top and entirely not relatable.",/review/rw8743869/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you liked Holidate, you will love this movie. Great performances for a light romantic comedy across the board. Great chemistry with multiple characters and just the right amount of depth for this film. The director creates a fun, endearing, sucks-you-into-the-story film. You will like these people. We need to see more of this type of film. Maybe a sequel?",/review/rw8743869/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2022,claudiaveronicaarias,10," Unexpectedly charming, loved it!
","I'm a big fan of Emma Robert's work, and familiar with Thomas Mann's work as well. When I saw they would be staring in a holiday rom-com together I had to watch! Both did a great job in this movie, specifically Mann who has always had hilarious comedic timing. His character is also genuinely kind that warms your heart, something that is usually disingenuously forced in your face with other rom coms. The story was entertaining and engaging enough to keep me glued to the screen. The supporting cast did a great job as well. Was it predictable? Yeah. However, it's the best holiday rom-com I've seen of the 2022 season. I recommend!",/review/rw8743869/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2022,rogerflores-41611,4," Disappointing
","Emma Roberts deserved better. Instead, this movie is an abject failure. From the music in the opening scene, which is cringe-worthy, to the lead actor, Thomas Mann, who is utterly un-photogenic to put it mildly, this pedestrian rom-com never makes it out of the gate. As a fan of rom-coms, it feels like the Director should apologize for these scenes in every single way possible, whether it be the lighting, the editing, the sound, to the actual filming itself. Nothing to see here. I am saddened that the likeable and quirky Emma Roberts was drowned in this disaster. Sorry. Nothing good to say about this. Just a waste.",/review/rw8743869/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2022,Anastasia97,2," pathetic theft of the original russian movie produced by Eldar Ryazanov
","The original Russian movie is an absolute iconic classic. In Russia, it makes sense and it relatable to the people. It was an absolute hit and people watch it every year on New years Eve till today. It accurately portrays life in former USSR and the relationships that were innocent and real. The present film is a failed caracature of the original, with fake characters, fake people, and fake relationships. It's a shame that people are no longer able to relate to each other on any meaningful level as they did in the original. Most of the Hollywoof films should have naver been produced and the money should have been donate to save abused animals.",/review/rw8743869/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2022,cary-70800,3," nothing new, these actors have no personality
","I really don't understand why they keep making this movie over and over again with different casts. If I see one more goddamn movie with the premise of some idiot, bringing another idiot, but they don't know to a wedding I'm gonna bust also if they run out of attractive and charismatic actors at this point, because the last few romantic comedies that I've tried to force myself to watch. I can't believe the slobs that they hired to be the romantic interest. And also it's super lame that you were making me get to 600 cat characters when I said everything that I wanted to say at 140 characters so please stop making people do this because then they give up and then you only get skewed reviews.",/review/rw8743869/?ref_=tt_urv

18 December 2022,NY32,10," Good good good
","An old style movie without the presumption to be a ""neorealism movie"" like those that win awards but nobody watches. I really enjoyed it. In a world where people confuse feelings with suffering, illness and other ""real"" things, well, watching this movie is like fresh water. Acting is fine, the story is clear since the first scene but who cares? We all need to dream, to love, to connect with our heart without constantly thinking about our real problems. We all live our days surrounded by anger, poverty, inflation, Covid, cancer, war, toxic relationships and a movie like this (as in the past) is a blessing.",/review/rw8743869/?ref_=tt_urv
