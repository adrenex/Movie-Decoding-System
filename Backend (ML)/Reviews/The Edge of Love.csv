1 November 2020,Bored_Dragon,8," ""Now imagine she's white.""
","When I first watched this film twenty years ago, I had to read a book as well. When I finished the book, I had to watch the movie again. ""A Time to Kill"" is one of the few examples where I can't decide whether it's a better novel or an adaptation, although I return to the film more often, simply because it requires less time and leaves an equally strong impression.",/review/rw7366109/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2002,tfrizzell,," Pretty Strong.
",A truly tense film that takes place in present-day Mississippi. A young African-American girl has been raped by two backwoods white men. Her father (Samuel L. Jackson) takes the law into his own hands and kills the two. Now the small town becomes a hot-bed of controversy as a murder trial starts that gets national attention. There is the defense attorney (Matthew McConaughey) and his bright-eyed assistant (Sandra Bullock) against prosecutor supreme Kevin Spacey. A really solid film that works because of a screenplay that pulls no punches and revolutionary direction by Joel Schumacher. A great ensemble cast all excel here and the film captures a place that has turned into a media circus very well. A film that you will watch with clenched fists. An intense experience. 4 stars out of 5.,/review/rw7366109/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2021,kosmasp,9," Verdict - (in)sane
","Accused of ... actually if there is one thing that is obvious is what someone is accused of here ... not just anyone. But while this is fast paced and has a lot of things happening from the get go, I will not go into too much of the story. But boy does this movie have an all star cast or what? The answer is yes, in case you are wondering.",/review/rw7366109/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2006,fimimix,10," ..most people missed the point the movie is not present-day..
","I had to stop reading the commentaries, because some people thought they were attorneys and rambled-on about injustice. My Friends, in the era this film is about, none of the story would be unusual. There are prejudices much worse even now - I was amazed that one person actually compared this wonderful film to ""Crash"": give the world a break!! If ""Crash""...Ugh!...proved anything, is was to reassure EVERYONE racism is still America's cancer.",/review/rw7366109/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2020,Xstal,7," Still Raising More Questions Than Answers...
","... and when you cascade politics, religion and justice into the cauldron and catalyse them with a culture that, like all cultures, struggles to shake off its generational prejudices, you're left with a hate that's as tough to eradicate as the common cold. Some fine performances all round and quite a spectacular list of actors milling around and in the courthouse. The saddest part for me is that watching it over 25 years after reading the book I've become too accepting that the world is incapable of recognising what the true cause of prejudice is because those we elect to authority really don't want to empower and uplift those who enter the world considerably less well off than the rest.",/review/rw7366109/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2005,The_Void,8," An entertaining spectacle with a nice comment on justice
","Courtroom dramas are well known for providing thrilling films, and that is exactly what 'A Time to Kill' thrives on; entertainment value. It is clear that the film, in spite of having some very potent themes, puts most of it's focus on being entertaining and it's actually not a bad film for it. Sometimes, films that want to be entertaining and have themes fall down because they're too entertaining and the themes get left by the wayside; but A Time to Kill puts its cards on the table from the start, and it's always clear what this film wants to do with itself. The plot follows a man who, after his daughter is raped and almost murdered, decides to take the law into his own hands. However, this man is also a black man living in a white supremacy state, and so the film injects a racism theme into it's plot, which is always going to mean that it will have some sort of social commentary within it. However, that isn't the most interesting comment that the film wants to make; as that plaudit falls to the idea of justice, and exactly what justice is.",/review/rw7366109/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2000,lspaiser,8," I was surprised this movie was this good after reading the book.

13 July 2018,classicsoncall,8," ""Ain't nothing more dangerous than a fool with a cause.""
","Another reviewer on this board made a comparison of the film with ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", and although the same thought came to me while watching it, the similarity is never fully realized. In the earlier movie, a black man was found guilty of raping a white woman, and the stereotype of redneck Southern justice is essentially carried out. The better comparison I think, can be made with another film I just recently viewed, that being ""Sleepers"", in which a pair of thugs murder a former reform school guard who physically abused them while they were in their teens. The whole idea of social justice is stood on it's head in both films, and if the thought behind each movie is to make viewers feel conflicted about their outcomes, then they both succeeded.

13 August 2010,tmpj,7," A very taut racial thriller !
","This one had me sitting on the edge of my seat. The 90s weren't as polite as the late 50s/ early 60s when we were riveted by ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", a book and film that author John Grisham credits as an influence to this story. Two ""Good Ol Boy"" racists go on a red-neck spree, disrespecting all things Black...men, women, and children. Their beer guzzling binge culminates in the rape and near murder of a 10 year old black girl. Samuel L Jackson plays her father...and he goes out for revenge, killing the two miscreants and seriously wounding a deputy sheriff in the process. The film there-after revolves around the very basic points : A. Can a Black man receive a fair trial even in the so-called ""New South"" after killing two white men...even though their crime was and is considered reprehensible by every decent human being? And B: Will the Black man receive competent legal representation and receive justice irrespective of his ""vigilante"" action which appears to many to be justified? What will be the fallout? Matt McConaughey's performance as the lawyer is slightly reminiscent of Gregory Peck in ""Mockingbird"". He has a moralistic reverence for the law, and endures the taunts of the townsfolk and his other encumbrances with fortitude. Sandra Bullock is convincing as the law student who wants to chime in and lend a hand for the experience. Don and Keifer Sutherland deliver solid support...the elder being a dis-barred lawyer who is ready with advice, the younger playing a racist Klansman out to get revenge for the two dead rednecks. The atmosphere hinges on the explosive as the racial tension builds, and it is a movie that is worth watching with a message worth pondering and remembering. See the film.",/review/rw7366109/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2001,Clever Jones,," Very well done
","I'm not sure why I didn't see this film when it came out, but I watched it for the first time last week and was blown away. ""A time to kill"" is not only very well done, but it shows the way racism is dealt with in an intertesting way. Every character is not only well developed, but the actors playing them make it totally believable. ",/review/rw7366109/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2019,nogodnomasters,8," MISSISSIPPI, RACE, KKK, TRIAL, RAPE, MURDER...
","MISSISSIPPI, RACE, KKK, TRIAL, RAPE, MURDER...did I miss anything? Two rednecks rape and beat the 10 year old daughter of Samuel L. Jackson, who fears they might get off. In open and broad daylight Jackson guns down the rapists. He is on trial for murder. Matthew McConaughey plays a sympathetic attorney who leads a rag-tag group (including Bullock and Donald Sutherland) to defend Jackson against the prosecuting attorney, Kevin Spacey (with a southern accent) who wants to make a name for himself in his bid for governor. The NAACP attempts to take over the case while an overly represented KKK terrorizes the town. Criticism: The temporary insanity plea is clearly a plea for jury nullification, although the movie never uses that phrase. The town appeared split on the case over racial lines with seemingly no middle ground.",/review/rw7366109/?ref_=tt_urv

16 October 1999,FISHCAKE,9," Here's a tough revenge film that tells it like it is.
","This tough filming of Grisham's novel about a black man's revenge for the brutal rape of his daughter by whites might lead one to some maxims for guidance of anyone in such a situation. Don't wait for the law to help when you know it won't. But, if you act on your own, be prepared for the worst. Don't always assume that someone different is automatically your enemy. That's racist mentality no matter from which end of the color spectrum you are observing. There are probably others one might deduce. This is a powerful and thought provoking film, well acted and produced. It puts the KKK in a true perspective as a bunch of neo-nazi thugs, and, mirabile dictu, there are no ""obligatory sex scenes"", at least not in the version I saw. My only cavil is the ""happy"" ending. It seems unlikely in the given environment, but then again maybe not.",/review/rw7366109/?ref_=tt_urv

6 November 2007,yddsp@aol.com,6," Could have been much better.....
","The storyline is compelling, the acting; very good, the direction; impressive, the only problem I have with this film is in the character of Sandra Bullock's, Ellen Roark. Her part was pathetically overwritten. If this was intentional to secure the interests of Ms. Bullock, then this is the movie's failing. I have nothing against Ms. Bullock as an actor, I have enjoyed her performances in numerous roles, however this happens to not be one of them. She is almost a comic book caricature of herself and it detracts from the impact of the story immensely. She professes to be a student of law, yet at many twists and turns she appears to be more knowledgeable of the law than her counterpart, the lead counselor for the defense (Matthew McConaughey), a bona fide licensed, practicing attorney. She also appears to possess a degree in medicine based on a scene where a simple ""band aid"" would seem counter-indicative considering the nature, source and force of the injury she simply 'dresses'.",/review/rw7366109/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2006,csauer,10," A time to thrill!
","Who in this movie does'nt play there part perfectly? The judge looks like a judge, a hanging judge at that. The sheriff is not a sugar coated law man, rather a tough Mississippi fair law man who knows what to do realistically. All the actors are cast in the only part they could be. THEN when the intensity of the movie gets to the boiling point who comes in to give us a break? You ALL know who. There she is to give us a break, and a laugh as Sandra swoops in on us. She is by far and away the most delightful actress I have ever seen. Even after she is beaten up and in a hospital bed she gives us a couple of chuckles. She has a delivery second to none. Every one, every one plays their role perfectly. Great movie, easy to follow, great story line, great all the way around. Do I like it? Yea about fifty times viewed like it.",/review/rw7366109/?ref_=tt_urv

","An adaptation that did the book justice. The acting, the pacing, and the script were all well done.
