10 January 2009,ChungMo,9," One of the best martial art films of this decade
","Excellent direction, photography and set design enliven this account of Wing Chun instructor Yip Man's life before he moved to Hong Kong. Every Wing Chun instructor today tries to make a lineage connection to Yip Man to legitimize their teaching so he is a very important figure in Kung Fu. Donnie Yen portrays the master with intense reserve and is possibly the best acting in his career. It surprised me for sure.",/review/rw2007693/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2008,DICK STEEL,10," A Nutshell Review: Ip Man
","I shall now proclaim unabashedly that I absolutely love this movie! It's been some time since we last saw a biopic on one of the Chinese's martial arts folk heroes, with Jet Li's Fearless being the last memorable one to hit the big screen. While Li lays claim to three of such roles in the iconic Wong Fei Hung (in the Tsui Hark movies), Fong Sai Yuk and Huo Yuan Jia in Fearless, after which he felt he had to hang up his martial arts roles because he thought that he had communicated all that he wanted about martial arts through these films. And thank goodness for Donnie Yen still being around to pick up from where the genre left off, and presenting a memorable role which he truly owned, with Ip Man being the first cinematic rendition of the Wing Chun martial arts grandmaster.",/review/rw2007693/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2008,Akira-36,9," Energetic & brilliant HK action drama
","This is Donnie Yen's best acting piece for awhile now, and he still delivers the action sequences brilliantly. At 44 years of age, he looks so energetic, confident and charismatic. I believe the combination of Yen, Sammo Hung and Wilson Yip is the right choice for this particular film and fighting style. Wing Chun is best depicted without the flamboyant ballet of acrobatics often seen in other wushu films.",/review/rw2007693/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2013,A_Different_Drummer,9," ""Holy Grail"" Spoiler -- Maybe best fight scene in martial arts films..
","OK, I realize I am out on a limb here. But I think I am onto something. First, let me say I have seen 99.9% of all martial arts films released in the west in the last 50 years, including entries from Japan, Thailand and Korea. Also in my youth I used to go into Chinatown in Montreal and watch direct imports from Hong Kong, no subtitles. So, credentials on the table, and already facing many disapproving glances from other martial arts cinephiles, I want to respectfully draw your attention to a scene about 3/4 the way through where the corrupt local officials decide to make their beef with the Ip Man character ""personal"" and go after his family. Let's pause for second. First this is a biopic and as I have said in my other reviews on IMDb, usually (but not always) for a biopic the rules are a bit different, and the story is a little more constrained. (In fact, for this sequels to this excellent film, they threw the rule book out the window, with attendant consequences, all bad, but I digress, I am not reviewing those films here.) Second, the casting. Some have complained that Donnie is too old for this kind of role but after spending so many years (decades) with Jet and Jackie, I think he is a breath of fresh air and clearly his skills in the Wing Chun style are authentic. Now to the fight scene. It is short, which puts me in double jeopardy because I have not only dared to pick a fight scene I think is a standout, but I have picked a scene which is short. In the scene, the character Ip Man, who TO THIS POINT IN THE FILM has been a model of restraint, reacts with true emotion when his family (his wife) is manhandled. He goes after those doing the attacking and his hands move so fast that for a moment it appears his opponents have been caught in a threshing machine. The reason I dare to compare this to other great scenes (such as for example the marvellous early, sequential, fight scenes in Ong Bak, also candidates for the greatest fight scenes of all time) is the emotional setup. In these kinds of films you rarely see emotion when the Masters fight. Here Donnie allows his character to show passion as he turns the bad guys to hamburger, and for that reason, I think this film, already iconic, should get special mention.",/review/rw2007693/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2008,dont_b_so_BBC,9," ""Wing Chun, Ip Man.""-- Donnie Yen.
","No wonder Ip Chun (Ip Man's son, consultant to this movie) was so pleased-- from the twinkle in his eyes to the lifting of his feet, Donnie Yen inhabits this movie like he is possessed by Ip Man. And as Ip Man himself explains early in the movie: ""the key is the person.""",/review/rw2007693/?ref_=tt_urv

30 January 2014,planktonrules,10," This ain't what your daddy watched back in the 1960s and 70s!
","I have seen and enjoyed many, many martial arts film. However, I am not blind to the problems that have often plagued the genre. For every exceptional film (such as most of the Shaw Brothers films or the better films of Sonny Chiba) there are the god-awful ones--movies that are embarrassingly bad. In these bad films, you see horrible martial arts where blows barely come near their opponents or kicks that look like my grandmother was fighting! Heck, I even remember one film with gorillas doing kung fu--and they obviously were two guys wearing VERY cheap Halloween costumes! Because of the many bad films, it's a pleasure to see ""Ip Man""--a film where the fighting is the most realistic you'll ever see. There is no 'wire fu' here--just fast and amazingly talented people making it look authentic.",/review/rw2007693/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2008,DouglasQuaid,8," Powerhouse performance by Donnie Yen
","Donnie Yen is a long time favorite of mine, although this is mainly due to his martial arts skills and screen presence rather than his acting skills. In Ip Man (or Ye Wen, as they were shouting in the seats next to mine) he delivers a truly solid performance on the acting side, carrying the burden of a nation on his shoulders with gravitas, at least that's what he conveyed to the audience at the cinema. They were actually applauding at times. Then again, moviegoers might be more absorbed over here on a regular basis. I digress.",/review/rw2007693/?ref_=tt_urv

22 December 2008,harry_tk_yung,," An extraordinary martial-art film
","I'll start with the martial art aspect. The Wing Chun style is not the best material for popular action movies. Its characteristic is motion efficiency: lighting fast movements and direct strikes, an approach that inspired Bruce Lee in the creation of his own style. While deadly effective, Wing Chun is not very exciting to watch. Furthermore, its kicks are low profile (both literally and figuratively), not the flying kicks that have become almost mandatory for today's popular kung-fu flicks. ""Ip Man""'s portrayal of this martial art style is quite authentic, granting a certain creative liberty for cinematic effects, understandably. Immensely satisfying for someone whose has some experience (albeit modest) with this style, such as this IMDb user, this movie may not satisfy those who are used to the usual Jet Li, Wu Jing (or indeed Donnie Yen) stuff.",/review/rw2007693/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2020,danielcereto,10," A truly Masterpiece
","I just discovered one of the most solid kung fu dramas I've ever watched. The movie It's about war, socialism, poverty and obviously Kung Fu.
First, acting and coreographies are amazing. Pretty well done. Second, the script is quite good. Hollywood should learn something from here. Last, it's a great movie with hearth just using a simple but deep story. Enjoy.",/review/rw2007693/?ref_=tt_urv

12 March 2009,lion_paw73,9," Wow, this is a instant classic!!
","Oh man what a great movie, Just seen it and im stunned. This moves up to my number 5 top list of greatest Martial Arts movies ever. Ip Man was a great man in Chinese history and i can see why. This movie is so well directed and Donnie Yen suits great as a young Ip Man. Its so dramatic at times, you start sniffing your nose and gets sad and angry at the same time. Awesome movie which will be a true classic instantly. I Bought the two disc HK Special Edition and i will see the extras later today cause i will go to sleep now, if i can sleep. Cant wait for part 2. See this film in theaters or on DVD as soon as you can, you will not be disappointed. Kung Fu cinema is back and what a comeback. WOW!!",/review/rw2007693/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2009,andydreamseeker,8," The Martial of Virtuosity - A Review of Ip Man
","Ip Man (1893-1972) is the expert in the Wushu fighting style of Wing Chun, and is the master of the famous Bruce Lee. As there has never been any previous film record of Ip Man, this film produced by Raymond Wong and directed by Wilson Yip will be the very first.",/review/rw2007693/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2011,YohjiArmstrong,," Ip needs manners
","IP MAN is one of those patriotic - jingoistic even - films about historical Chinese defeats which create a fictional tournament in which an underdog Chinese can symbolically defeat foreigners using martial arts, thereby restoring Chinese honour. This time it's Ip Man, the trainer of Bruce Lee, who takes on northern bandits and the invading Japanese in 1930s China. The story is predictable but that's the norm for martial arts flicks. What sinks this one is just how perfect Ip Man is. He's so great that even though the fights feature admirable technique by Donnie Yen, they're drama free because the outcome is never in doubt. Similarly, nothing shakes the man, leading to the glorious moment when he announces to his wife, who is dying of starvation after the Japanese stole their house, that he will get a job -- did this not occur to him earlier? To add insult to injury, it ends with a text crawl which tries to claim that the Japanese defeat in 1945 was due to the Chinese (because Ip Man inspired them) which is as shameless as it is ahistorical.",/review/rw2007693/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2009,minlu_hbtv,10," a touching movie
","Ip Man is very touching and full of mildness,considering it's an action movie. Wisedom, courage, elegance, humour...all the mixed elements you surely will feel from Ip man and they will definitely move you. All actors have done a great job. I believe this is the best movie that Zhen Zidan has ever contributed. This time he is not only a warrior, but also a wise, gentle, and conscientious man, a good husband. People clapped hands and weeped from time to time. I have watched it for two times,and longing for the third time when the DVD is coming. You know, Ip Man did not ballyhoo before it is shown, but it undoubtedly becomes a huge dark horse. It is really worthy of watching it.",/review/rw2007693/?ref_=tt_urv

","I had a choice of watching The Spirit or Ip Man. It is a tough decision and after a long while, I finally makes the choice of watching Ip Man. The director of Dragon Tiger Gate makes his comeback with his usual star, Donnie Yen. As expected, the martial arts fighting scenes are amazing. This director is amazing, he knows how to direct realistic martial arts fighting features in Dragon Tiger Gate. This guy can create, I can say, some of best martial arts movies.",/review/rw2007693/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2019,Tweekums,9," Must see martial arts action
","This film is loosely based on the life of Chinese martial arts master Ip Man during the Japanese occupation. It opens in 1935 in the city of Foshan. The city is famed for its many martial arts schools but Ip Man doesn't operate a school despite being a more proficient fighter than all the other kung fu masters. He lives a comfortable life with his wife and young son but all that changes in 1937 when the Japanese take the city. The martial arts schools close and the various masters find themselves working at a local coal mine. Word of their presence gets back to the Japanese general and he has them fight his men for bags of rice. After the death of a friend Ip Man gets involved and defeats ten Japanese fighters at once; the general wants him to train his men in the Wing Chun form of Kung fu, but he refuses. The only people he trains are Chinese workers who are being attacked by bandits. Ultimately though he will have to face the Japanese general who is an expert fighter himself.",/review/rw2007693/?ref_=tt_urv

","Donnie Yen headlines this excellent biopic of Ip Man, a real-life historical figure who taught Bruce Lee wing chun and overcame Japanese oppression on the eve of WW2. Straight away I was reminded of the Jet Li film FEARLESS, another biopic about a real-life martial artist, but from the first fight scene I knew that IP MAN was going to be better: the wirework isn't as obvious and there are none of the cheesy CGI effects that spoiled some of the fights in the Li film.",/review/rw2007693/?ref_=tt_urv
