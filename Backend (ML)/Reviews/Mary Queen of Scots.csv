8 January 2022,guskeller,5," Modern Commercialism
","The 355 is modern commercialism. It has little to say and is painfully generic, but it plays up its female-centric cast, hoping to make up for its thin substance. Diverse representation is a positive, but when it's solely a marketing gimmick for an underwhelming project, it's tainted. In fact, The 355 is fairly insulting because female led movies often get these poor efforts. Specifically, the film is a collection of cliches. Stock characters, predictable heel turns, unrealistic MacGuffins, exaggerated stakes, and some deus ex machina for good measure. Plus, the acting is bland (outside of Nyong'o, who brings legitimate emotion).",/review/rw7804322/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,Nixon_Carmichael,3," Essentially a big and silly version of a Charlie's Angels episode.
","Looking at the wattage of the cast one might wonder how on Earth a project like this could go so horrifically awry, but then you have to remember that it is directed by none other than Simon Kinberg. Kinberg who is a talented and successful producer unto himself has demonstrated once more that he requires a high caliber screenplay to be placed into his hands prior to rolling cameras.",/review/rw7804322/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2022,Ed-Shullivan,9," Kick A$$ action film with some good twists and turns - ignore the bad reviews
","I looked at some of the other IMDb reviews and I wonder if they were watching another film than the entertaining film I just watched. This film had some great entertainment value from start to end. There were some good twists and turns in the plot. Heck, even the end credit music score title ""Super Clean"" was fantastic. Kudos to the five main actresses, especially Jessica Chastain and Diane Kruger whose action scenes were just as good (if not better) than many of the CGI enhanced action films dominated by male stars.",/review/rw7804322/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2022,Miroslav-27,7," Underrated Star-Studded Action
","I think The 355 is suffering from a bit of gender bias because it's definitely not as bad as the reviews say. I've seen many action films with predominantly male casts that are much worse than this but have higher ratings. Does The 355 reinvent the spy or action genres? No. But does it kick a lot of ass and provide for a fun Saturday night blockbuster? Absolutely! Sure the plot and antagonists are a bit shallow, but there are some impressive fight sequences, a couple of twists, and some raw emotion that provide enough substance for viewers.",/review/rw7804322/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2022,imdb020-643-129772,2," Almost fell asleep
","They did almost everything to kill this movie - a shallow story, a very slow pace, bad directing, flat dialogs, drunk cameraman, music video-like editing.",/review/rw7804322/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,madelinehind,3," Cheap mission impossible rip off
",Jessica Chasrain supposedly turned down a role in the Tom Cruise Mission Impossible film series so it is easy to see where the idea comes from for the 355. Chastain tries to rectify her error by being involved in the creation of this wannabe franchise.,/review/rw7804322/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2022,ksf-2,7," pretty good spy thang
","When a devastating weapon falls into the wrong hands, agents from all over must work together to find it and get it back. Nick and mace ( sebastian stan, jessica chastain) want it. But we're not sure which side they are on. And they will need help from graciela (cruz) and marie (diane kruger). No-one trusts anyone. And even when they think they have the weapon back, it gets taken... again! Lots of action, shooting, chasing. Lupita nyongo has her high tech gadgets that help now and then. But so much violence. Not so much blood and guts, but lots of shooting. Good stuff. Good spy thrilla. Directed by simon kinberg. Was nominated for martian. Its not perfect, but I rated it higher than some others have.",/review/rw7804322/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2022,stevelivesey67,4," I can see why it lost a ton of money

11 January 2022,drpainters,5," The producer who thought he was better then his directors
","You always hear stories of producers interfering and taking over the directors vision. And here you have a producer, who has now directed 2 terrible movies that werent well done by him. Clearly they should just stick to supplying and making money and leave the art/skill of directing to the professionals.",/review/rw7804322/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2022,ebqrkhf,1," Plot so thin...
","Just simply 'bad.' Very hammy & cheesy, i just couldn't get into it. My wife fell asleep, had to keep waking her up! LOL
Acting was wooden and dialogue campy and forced... I just could not figure out what direction it was going!",/review/rw7804322/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2022,Calicodreamin,6," Predictable, but good acting & action
","The storyline was very predictable, like all of the twists were given away in the trailer. However, the characters were well cast and the action was well coordinated. The women had good chemistry.",/review/rw7804322/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2022,TxMike,," Popcorn movie! Like Charlie's Angels but with five highly trained ladies fighting evil.
","My wife and I watched this on Peacock streaming. The movie has received very mixed reviews, and I can understand why. Not all of it makes sense, and the ""drive"" that is being sought and auctioned is a mcguffin of sorts. It is the thing that unites the five ladies, from secret agencies of several different countries, to finally band together to keep it out of the hands of the wealthy oligarchs.",/review/rw7804322/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2022,calicut110,6," It's better than what most reviews say
","I thought this was about as good as any recent spy action thriller. Good action, plot twists and ending. It's a bit predictable and formulaic and not very believable in many parts. Overall pretty entertaining.",/review/rw7804322/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2022,tizerkatie-16024,2," Bad and boring.
",I went into this thinking it would be somewhat like the female version of oceans 11 (which I did enjoy - it was cute and fun),/review/rw7804322/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2022,lavatch,7," Destined to be a Franchise?
","""The 355"" is an unfairly maligned film! A star-studded cast is led by Jessica Chastain in the role of Mason ""Mace"" Brown, a kick-boxing CIA asset chosen to track down a ""drive"" that has the potential to incite World War III. Mace is ably assisted by four other dynamic women in the just cause.",/review/rw7804322/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2022,ronkoja,1," These aren't believable action stars
","I actually really like the actresses' work in other genres', and think Chastain is fantastic. Having said that, did Hollywood really think anyone would want to see this? I feel like any regular movie goer would tell you they could care less. Nobody wants to see these talented ladies in an action film like this. It doesn't help that the story, action scenes, villains, etc. Are all bland. Hopefully they will learn their lesson, and stop flushing money.",/review/rw7804322/?ref_=tt_urv

28 January 2022,georgewilliamnoble,3," Over Boiled Glossy Nonsense
","This modern Hollywood A-lister action flick was so insipid and uninteresting I confess to a few power naps and that was after only 10 minutes. This glossy trip with its copycat female James Bonds or maybe Jason Bournes is a concept borrowed from Charlies Angels TV series of the 1970s battered and bashed me to snooze land, the eye candy simply had no engagement or any character development as incredulous action sequence followed one after the other proved relentless and relentlessly tedious. All that is worst in modern commercial cinema is encapsulated in one very drab movie.",/review/rw7804322/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2022,kwenchow,2," Another fail female lead action film! Full of boring conversation, and abysmal action scene! Not recommended!
","This film start with a bunch of people raiding a place, and a man ""Luis"" reveal himself scene! As turnout, this film is about a female CIA agent ""Mace"" need to assemble a female team to stop her lover ""Nick"" to possess the so called top secret weapon! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the searching scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the hacking scene, and overuse of the talking on the phone scene! Make the film unwatchable! All the action scene have blood, things broken, and explosion at certain point, but overall portray by sideways, and occur in too short of time! The martial art fighting scene also too slow, and messy! Make the film frustrated to watch! At the end, Mace, and her crew manage to stop Nick to obtain the top secret weapon! That's it! Another disappointed film!",/review/rw7804322/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2022,FeastMode,5," Great cast in an up-and-down movie
",I had a decent time with this movie. It's nothing special but is mostly enjoyable. The best part is the cast. I love Jessica Chastain. Diane Kruger gives a good performance. Lupita Nyong'o is kind of a beast; she kills the emotional moments. The action is fun and I was never bored.,/review/rw7804322/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2022,dlmiley,5," Only Slightly better than a ""Charlies Angels"" episode
","This is a routine spy thriller with the only difference using beautiful women working as a team instead of James Bond or some other male character. Stars Jessica Chastain, Diane Krug, Penelope Cruz, Lupita Nyong'o, and Bingbing Fan try hard to no avail. The story is completely contrived and features dubious action scenes where the women beat up huge men. The movie is only slightly less ridiculous than a Charlie's Angels episode. Not recommended. 5/10.",/review/rw7804322/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,djmike-63474,9," This movie is kicka$$
","All of the people with the negative reviews, must have watched a different movie. I love action movies with female leads, and this one has it all. Martial arts, gun play, violence, and a touch of romance. I'm not one who watches movies twice, but you can bet I'll be watching this one again. WATCH THIS MOVIE 🎬. In the words of Tony the tiger, it is Great. Watch it.",/review/rw7804322/?ref_=tt_urv
