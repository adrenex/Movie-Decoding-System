15 October 2020,etmachina,6," Starts strong then hits a brick wall head on.
","The first three episodes are fairly strong. It's basically Wicker Man meets the classic show The Island. Not super original, but done very well and all the acting is superb.",/review/rw6096240/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2020,ScoobySnacks66,8," Creepy, mysterious with potent atmospherics
","Opens with Sam, a husband and father on a solo and sorrowful excursion in the middle of nowhere England memorializing what appears to be a dead child by throwing a small t-shirt into a stream, soon after he comes across a couple of kids playing in the woods - except they're not playing; one nearly dies in what seems like a freakish suicide attempt before Sam intervenes. He drives the recovering teenager home, to her small community on the island of Osea. There, things start to get weird, really weird. I've only seen the first episode and it's intriguing and super creepy. Jude Law is his charming, if not cowardly, self and he does a good job giving Sam an air of anxiety and desperation that starts to build a foreboding sense of doom. The villagers of Osea are a motley assortment, some are friendly most are weirdos. As the story unfolds the spirit of the island and Sam's destiny within it seem to conspire against his ability in ever leaving. If it were me in Sam's shoes, I'd be stealing a boat and getting the hell out of Osea pronto. It's going to be interesting to see where this creep-fest goes.",/review/rw6096240/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2020,katbodine,5," Mixed reviews explained...
","I have watched the first 4 episodes so far.
I agree with every single review here. So why are they so polarized?",/review/rw6096240/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2020,urbanspider,10," Wicker man vibe
","Only just seen the first episode and really enjoyed it, it reminds me of The Wicker Man / Midsommer. So if your into that sort of thing give it a go!",/review/rw6096240/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2020,Xavier_Stone,3," Disjointed, puzzling, annoying at times with overused closeups
",If that is what you're into then this show is for you. Most of us aren't interested in plot inconsistencies and baffling characters meandering through a mysterious town. Color scheme is off putting but different so that maybe a plus for some people.,/review/rw6096240/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2020,byrnensorg,4," What a disappointing ending
","This is another of those series of two halves. The first , we'll say 4 episodes kept the suspense and creepiness at a high, then the last two, well what can I say, drowned in its own pretentiousness, leaving lots of unanswered questions, like what becomes of the island, who was the boy, why were there so many disemboweled people and animals, who were these mysterious island Celts, why is the island the center of the world, how did such crimes go unnoticed for such a long time and why do they have such a bug problem, but no answers were forthcoming in the last episode just lots of gruesome killings and gratuitous uses of the C word.",/review/rw6096240/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2020,ruidanielbarrossss,8," I would love to Binge this series
","One episode seen and I wanted to see more. This series seemed to me, kind of a mix of Lost with Midsommar. And the color of this series sometimes reminded me of certain Wes Anderson films.",/review/rw6096240/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2020,UniqueParticle,9," Mind-bending delight
","Absolutely incredible atmospheric cinematography, stylish direction, and glorious mystery! I don't know what's going on I love that aspect. Jude Law is riveting to watch so is Katherine Waterson! I really like what others said The Third Day has Lost, Wicker Park, and Midsommar vibes. I'm excited to see how the rest plays out.",/review/rw6096240/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2020,jmancheski,6," Plot vs. Plot Twists
","It's so hard to rate this, because it's one of the most intense and creative shows I've ever seen. There are some aspects that are really well done, and the cinematic effects (filters/lighting) carry a lot of the weight and accentuate Sam's experiences. Sometimes, though, it's a little overdone, much like my 14 year old self on Instagram with all the effects. And then there's the plot. Again, incredibly creative and intense, but any sort of character motivation is sacrificed to serve plot twist upon plot twist upon plot twist. It makes little sense at the end. The only character whose motivation I can follow somewhat clearly is Sam's, and there are many things in the first episode that should have been answered or referenced in the following parts of the series. Maybe they will be in the coming 'second half'. I really hope the 'Winter' segment is easier to follow, because every single character changing allegiances approximately 4 times per episode is making ME feel like I took LSD at a Celtic festival.",/review/rw6096240/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2020,jmsneddon123,3," Dreadful
","Completely unbelievable main character whose decision making is cartoon like.
Photography is great.
Plot is awful.",/review/rw6096240/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2020,SnoopyStyle,6," structure, structure, structure
","Troubled Sam (Jude Law) sees a girl hanging herself. He rescues her and she directs him to her home, Osea Island with a causeway connected to the mainland only at low tide. The Martins (Paddy Considine, Emily Watson) run the tavern. Sam is thrown together with Jess (Katherine Waterston) and the island becomes more inescapable. The surrealism culminates in craziness at the end of episode 3. In episode four, new protagonist Helen (Naomie Harris) arrives on the island with daughters Ellie and Talulah.",/review/rw6096240/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2020,guycullen-29116,9," Excellent ðŸ˜³
","I can't believe people are slagging this one off. It's intense and compelling and the fact that the main characters make bizarre, unlikely choices is part its appeal. It hints that the main protagonists are either not in their right frame of mind or are existing and moving through realms outside of the temporal world.
The acting is superb and the essence of mystery the whole package delivers is riveting.
Many reviewers on here have suggested it has a Wicker Man vibe which is true but this seems to go deeper into the human psyche and is less inevitable in its direction.
I wish I'd have waited to binge watch all episodes on a rainy Sunday afternoon with a big mug of tea and no interruptions
This is definitely one I'll keep to watch again",/review/rw6096240/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2020,mariopilloni,6," Style over substance!
","Some people seem to appreciate style over substance according to a lot of reviews. Only second episode in, I've never seen such abnormal, unnatural behaviour in a main character. It doesn't make sense how Jude Law's character reacts to his situation. There is a stellar cast, Jude Law is great, there is oodles of intrigue to keep you hooked. The cinematography is amazing but hopefully it will improve in the story. 4th episode in and Naomie Harris (who I'm not a fan of) is another character introduced whose character reaches higher levels of abnormal behaviour than what Jude Law did. This episode is home literally the most nonsensical, mystifying, stupid writing I have ever seen in what should be a well produced show.",/review/rw6096240/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2020,morgan-659-312842,4," In two minds
","This is one of those programmes that can leave you in two minds. On the one hand there is the excellent cast. On the other is an appalling script. Would continued viewing be a waste of time or would everything come together? I started watching this because Jude Law is in it. All I can think of at the moment is 'Why is he in it?' What a waste of a talent. And Emily Watson and Paddy Considine. Surely they must have better things to do. I think I will stick with it, at least for a while but please don't let it be a Wicker Man scenario.",/review/rw6096240/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2020,t-unknown-one,5," Might be your thing but really nothing makes any sense.
","I just can't get into a show where, as other reviews have pointed out, the main characters reactions to the situation just don't make any sense. Firstly if I ever, as a married man with kids, found a girl hanging herself in the woods, my first move would not be to put her in my car and drive her to a strange place that I suspect may be the root of her suicidal episode. My first move would be to involve the authorities or some type of healthcare professional. The girl is unconscious and I have no idea how she will react when she comes to and if she might actually be unstable enough to say I did something to her. The first move would be to have it on record that I brought her to the attention of the authorities regardless of how shaky a reputation child welfare agencies may have in my mind, I need to look out for myself and my family first. That would make for a whole different type of long drawn out story but at least it would be believable and less annoying. Then as he wanders around the island he hides when he sees other people. Why? He hides in the bushes while a man pees right in front of him. I thought they were going to have the guy pee right on him but they spared us that. Why though, is he hiding? It's just plain goofy.
I give it 5 stars for the cast and cinematography but I'm going to have to find something less frustrating to watch.",/review/rw6096240/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2020,aprilgregh,8," Unsettling
","I've only seen the first episode, but it is the first series I have seen in a while that left me wanting to see the next episode immediately. Beautifully shot and generally unnerving; like a good book, anxious to turn the page to see what happens next.",/review/rw6096240/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2020,paul-allaer,7," Strange happenings on a British isle...
","""The Third Day"" (2020 release from the UK; 6 episodes of about 55 min. each) brings the story of Sam. As Episode 1 ""The Father"" opens, we are told it is ""Summer"" and we get to know Sam, a middle aged guy. He is frantically on the phone somewhere out in the English countryside. It appears his garden center back in London was robbed. By pure happenstance, he hears a young woman nearby, just as she is about to hang herself. He manages to rescue her, and offers to drive her home. Home turns out to be Osea Island, which can be reached only when the sole access road isn't flooded by the tides. As Sam drops the young lady off, he is welcomed warmly by her parents. But not all appears as it first looks... At this point we are 10 min. into Episode 1, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw6096240/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2021,oliverbm,9," You'll love it or hate it
","The overall rating (currently 6.4) doesn't reflect this. Fact is, you will either love this or hate it, which means the average rating will be mediocre. Personally I loved this show. Atmospheric and suspenseful, incredible acting and nice and dark. So many unanswered questions, enabling you to ponder long after the credits have rolled.",/review/rw6096240/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2020,wendajones,7," Strange but riveting
","I've now watched the first three episodes and want to react before watching the next three. I must say it was very, very strange but very, very alluring viewing. Jude Law was absolutely magnificent, as in fact he always is but here he was just so good. Peculiar camera shots, reality lapses and all sorts of funny things but for Jude Law's performance alone I really enjoyed it. Still not sure about the ""meaning"" but am not worried about that too much!
The next day! So now I've watched the next three episodes and my judgement remains. I can really understand why some people don't appreciate this. We all have really different tastes. But i found it compelling to use a word I don't normally use! In parts so exciting that I had to pause and do something else for a few minutes before continuing. The ending was a little disappointing but I don't know how else it could have ended really. The reality that was created was very gripping and as usual I managed to work in an allegory to some things in our real world! Don't watch if all you want is a straight forward horror movie though!",/review/rw6096240/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2020,lisaeveboden,4," Great acting just a shame about the ending
","I was unsure whether to keep watching but every week I did tune in. After the full 6 episodes I can now honestly say I wish I hadn't bothered. I just don't feel like the ending showed me the reason for wasting 6 hours of my time tuning in each week. It was just one acid trip after another. The ending perhaps wasn't meant to be the end of it all? But if there is another series I definitely won't bother watching it.
It's a shame because the acting was great and I wanted to like it!",/review/rw6096240/?ref_=tt_urv

15 September 2020,terrylarosa,1," Close up horror
","If you ever wanted to watch a show where a good percentage of the scenes feature one or both of the inside of an actor's nostrils then this is your dream show. Terrible dialogue, nonsensical scenes, chaotic camerawork and disjointed uninteresting characters make this a hunk of junk. Drugs must have featured heavily in the making of this abomination. This is the second HBO show which I gave up watching after the ludicrous Lovecraft Country went completely off the rails by the second ep. These are some of the new kinds of shows that are beyond unwatchable. Stay away far away.",/review/rw6096240/?ref_=tt_urv
