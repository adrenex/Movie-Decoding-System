2 October 2007,wes-connors,9," Gone Fishing
","Craig Sheffer (as Norman) and Brad Pitt (as Paul) are Montana sons-of-a-preacher man Tom Skerritt (as Reverend Maclean). You will immediately notice the breathtaking Montana scenery - photography by Philippe Rousselot, direction by Robert Redford, with an obviously adept cast and crew. The kids playing the younger Macleans were quite an asset; I did recognize Joseph Gordon-Levitt in an impressive debut (though not his first). As I was watching, I thought: well, it looks all nice, but what's happening? I was unsure about the film's focus. The film is often slow and confusing, even if you are familiar with the Norman MacLean story; and, this is a somewhat alternate version/vision of the original written work.",/review/rw0312468/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2004,AZINDN,9," Picturesque and Literary: An Ode to the American Wilderness
","I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and appreciated his love of the American people and the land. In A River Runs Through It, Redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high Rocky Mountains of Montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author Norman Maclean, and stunning camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot).",/review/rw0312468/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2001,Anonymous_Maxine,10," Historical accuracy is one of the things that makes this such a good drama.
","(spoilers) A River Runs Through It is an excellent story of the lives of one family, from the time the two sons were young boys to the time when one of them is an old man, and everyone else has died. Brad Pitt delivers yet another great performance as the younger and wilder son Paul, and the unappealing looking Craig Sheffer stars as Paul's older brother Norman, from whose point of view the entire film is told.",/review/rw0312468/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2008,whpratt1,8," Very Deep Heart Searching Film
","Enjoyed this film produced by Robert Redford which deals with a Presbyterian Minister who has two sons, one is reserved and the other is a hell raiser. This film takes place in Montana and the beauty of their rivers and wonderful land and its beautiful mountains. Tom Skeritt, (Rev. MacLean) plays the role of a very loving parent of Norman MacLean, (Craig Sheffer) who is basically a very straight arrow and also his brother Paul MacLean, (Brad Pitt) who is a newspaper reporter and has a very wild way living especially with drinking and plenty of women. There is a sweet romance between Norman MacLean and Jessie Burns, (Emily Lloyd) who fall in love with each other and these two people try to guide Paul MacLean into a better way of living but he just cannot seem to settle down. Great film about what life is really about in many families. Enjoy",/review/rw0312468/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 1999,macpherr,10," This movie is very dear to my own Heart! Movies cannot get better than this!
","I have read the short story by Norman Maclean, and the movie did justice to Norman Maclean's  writing. My husband tends to reread it occasionally, and I myself have read it over and scenes of the movie keeps coming to mind.  We have  videos of many of Redford s movies  and we have watched ""A River runs through it"" many times.  Redford is part of the ""famdamily"" as he is always around.   We never get tired of Redford's perception of Norman Maclean writings, and the beauty of Montana. The script reminds me very much of my own upbringing as my father had the same calling as Mr. Maclean's father. According to ""A River Runs Through It,"" ""Methodists are Baptists who can read,""  a line which by the way is not in the short story,  but I think that is a funny line!  My husband and I are well-read Baptists!",/review/rw0312468/?ref_=tt_urv

","I won't go far to say that Robert Redford is God, that would be not very professional on my behalf, but let's just say, the man can do it all in the film industry, act, direct, produce, write you name it. Here let's just say that in ""A River Runs Through It"", Redford shows us different side to his artistic traits: the visual storyteller. Here he's telling the story not through words, but through creating images that will keep you entertained, draw to tears and most of all to please his audience and for that I say hats off to you, Mr. Redford. You are a true Hollywood icon!",/review/rw0312468/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2018,classicsoncall,9," ""I'll never leave Montana, brother.""
","There is perhaps no better illustration of poetry in motion than the fluid rhythm of casting a fly fisherman's rod. The scenes of Reverend Maclean (Tom Skerritt) and his sons Norman (Craig Sheffer) and Paul (Brad Pitt) fly fishing in the Big Blackfoot had an almost hypnotic effect on this viewer; if only I could pursue the art of casting a fly rod with such grace. The story will resonate with those affected by father/son relationships, and possibly even more for anyone who has, or had, a brother who meant as much to them as Norman and Paul did for each other in this film. It wasn't until I finished watching this movie that I found out it was based on the real life story of Norman Maclean, an American author and scholar who published a book under the same title as the picture ('A River Runs Through It and Other Stories').",/review/rw0312468/?ref_=tt_urv

","There is not much more I can say about this movie than all of the commentaries on page one, except - as Jesse says - ""it's the berries"". All of page one's commentators wrote eloquently - as almost so as the dialog is in this movie. This just may be one of those illusive things we hear so much about, but usually are made so by the actors who deliver the lines: a beautiful script. Maybe Robert Redford did hold strict sway onto the actors/actresses during the filming of this movie, so that the beauty of the story would not get lost.",/review/rw0312468/?ref_=tt_urv

","I don't remember the book very well, apart from feeling that it was wildly overwritten--the author's sense of lyrical self-importance almost overwhelmed everything else. But the basic elements seemed like they'd adapt well to film. However, when this came out I heard very mixed things about it, mostly that it was very pretty to look at but not very compelling otherwise.

10 February 2006,defdewd,10," Pay attention to the themes that never go away
","Have you seen The Graduate? It was hailed as the movie of its generation. But A River Runs Through It is the story about all generations. Long before Dustin Hoffman's character got all wrapped up in the traps of modern suburbia, Norman Maclean and his brother Paul were facing the same crushing pressures of growing up as they tried to find their place in the world. But how could a place like post WW1 Montana be a showcase for the American family, at a time when the Wild West still was not completely gone? Just what has Maclean tapped into that strikes so deeply at who we all are and what we have to go through to find ourselves? As the movie opens, Norman is an old man, flyfishing beside a rushing river, trying to understand the course his own life has taken. The movie is literally a journey up through his own stream of consciousness, against time's current and back to when he was a boy. He and his younger brother Paul were the sons of a Presbyterian minister and devoted mother. The parents fit snugly into their roles. Mom takes care of house and home. Dad does the work of the Lord. The boys ponder what they will be when they grow up. Norm has it narrowed down to a boxer or a minister like his dad. Given the choice, little Paul would be the boxer, since he's told his first choice of pro flyfisherman doesn't even exist. The boys grow up and get into trouble with their pranks, fight to see who is tougher and do the things brothers do, all the while attending church and taking part in all other spiritual matters like flyfishing. They are at similar points in their lives before college. But when Norm returns from his six years at Dartmouth, things are very different. Paul is at the top of his game. Master flyfisherman. Grad of a nearby college and newspaper reporter who knows every cop on the beat and every judge on the bench. Norman is stunningly well educated for his day but has little idea what to do with his life, even as his father grills him about what he intends to do. You're left feeling that at least to Pops, God will call you to your life's work. But you have to stay open and ready to receive it -- all your life. Father has always taken his boys to reflect by the side of the river and contemplate God's eternal words. ""Listen,"" their father urges. It's both Zen and Quakerly. Pretty radical for a stoic clergyman. But with all the beauty and contemplation, and even though the Macleans are truly a God-fearing, scripture-heeding household, how is it that Rev. Maclean's family is unraveling? Paul is true perfection as he fishes the river, but he's feeling the pull of gambling and boozing, while his family doesn't know how to keep him from winding up where he seems to be headed. Mom, Dad and Brother all seem to have the same quiet desperation of not knowing what they should be doing and why they can't seem to help. Pauly just waves it all off with a grin and his irresistible charm. But the junior brother is losing his grip. Norman starts getting his life on track, finding love and career, but Paul continues to slide. The family that loves him watches helplessly. Mother, Father, Brother flounder in their own ways trying to help, but none very effectively. How can a family that loves each other so much be so ill-equipped to handle this? How can someone be so artful and full of grace when out in God's nature, yet be somehow unfit or unwilling to fit into the constructs of society that God's peoples have made for themselves? These are all questions Norman will ponder his entire life. The eternal words beneath the smooth stones of the river forever haunt him, yet keep their secrets. The movie is beautiful to watch. This is certainly God's country, and filming it won an Oscar. Director Robert Redford plays with the story from the book and teases the narration a bit to follow the emotional pattern he's presenting, and it works well. But do go back and read the book, too. You'll see Norman made connections with his old man even deeper than the movie can suggest -- and you'll see the places where the storyteller's very words gurgle and sing right off the page with an exuberance of a river running through it, leading into the unknown.",/review/rw0312468/?ref_=tt_urv

","Upon seeing this film once again it appeared infinitely superior to me this time than the previous times I have viewed it.  The acting is stunningly wonderful.  The characters are very clearly drawn.  Brad Pitt is simply superb as the errant son who rebels.  The other actors and actresses are equally fine in every respect.  Robert Redford creates a wonderful period piece from the days of speakeasies of the 1920s.  The scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountains and streams of western Montana.  All in all, this is one of the finest films made in the 1990s.",/review/rw0312468/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2005,dataconflossmoor,10," Montana only LOOKS!! Serene
","A stunning realization occurs when some sort of phenomenon takes place!! Be it, firecrackers going off, witnessing a robbery, a hurricane nonchalantly devastating everything in it's path, or, for that matter, any other spectacular occurrence !! In the case of the Maclean Family, however, reveille was something which was no more complex than their day to day lives..Montana in the early twentieth century was an environment which was rough and tumble...The Maclean family was comprised of four people, the father, a minister, who was ideologically driven to raise his family properly. His wife was God fearing, and dutiful. The two boys were, well...BOYS!!.. What else can you say?...Brad Pitt starred in this film before he was really THE!! Brad Pitt, and his acting performance in this film was, to say the least, remarkable!!!.. His brother, Norman, was the cerebral type, he was touched by emotions that were genuine, and motivated by a set of values that Missoula, Montana concurred with!! Paul (Brad Pitt) was a misfit from the offset, and lived on the edge...You would think that Montana in the 1920's had no such thing, yet somehow, gambling, drinking, and violent confrontations, were as much a part of Paul, as was his fly fishing rod!! Fly fishing!! Did I say that? Parenthetically, this was the core of this movie's theme!! The recreation of fly fishing served as the cohesive bond which homogenized the kindred spirits of the Maclean brothers, and to a lesser degree, the father!! I would describe the acting in this film as incredibly believable, and the cinematography went beyond sensational.. Put it this way, anyone who sees this film will want to live in Montana.. Breathtaking filmography of bluer than blue mountains and streams captured the youth and effervescence that the Maclean brothers had for life...Seldom in a film do you witness whereby feelings immediately invoke a dogged tenacity to accomplish whatever it may be that someone wishes to accomplish..The Maclean brothers lived life to the fullest, and for better or worse, the father knew that this was going to be the only way the two of them could become men!!...Robert Redford directs this film, and tells the story of the Maclean's through the perspective of the older brother, Norman...Norman gets offered a position at the University of Chicago at age 26, and marries the woman he will always be in love with...What this film also points out, is that the younger brother, Paul, has attained an accomplishment of his own by being the epitome of a remarkable fly fisherman!! The seedier side of life prevails in the younger brother's existence, and exerts an insidious form of consternation for the Maclean family!! As most human shortcomings go, the Maclean family made light of turbulent waters, (literally) and thus, established unity as a family, by putting necessary blinders on!!!",/review/rw0312468/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've never been a monumental Robert Redford fan, but that being said, I truly think that A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT is not only Redford's greatest accomplishment (in this case as a director), but also one of the top 10 films of the 90s. First, RIVER is a beautiful film to look at: the glorious scenic view of skies, mountains, streams, valleys, roads of 1920s Missoula, Montana.

1 March 2019,tthylayia,10," One of my very favorite movies...
","I love this movie so much for many reasons. Of course, the amazing performances from this talented and superb cast is the main reason to add this film to a favorites list. However, I was raised by similar folks, in a similar setting and with very similar values. I can relate to pretty much every aspect of the movie. From the preacher father right down to the siblings that are completely different....but then they're not.
I have watched this movie at least once a year since it was first released. And at every viewing I cried like a baby. Not just a few tears but actually weep. The film is just so real and beautifully done that it alway releases many buried feelings.
My favorite character is ,Craig Sheffer, Norman. Robert Redford did an amazing directing job and was the perfect voice for the narrator. All this said I still think the movie could have never been so wonderful if it were shot anywhere other than Montana. What a gorgeous state!",/review/rw0312468/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2009,GeneSiskel,9," Fall From Grace
","""A River Runs Through It,"" like the Norman Maclean memoir on which it is based, is an elegy in which a man's fly fishing technique stands in for his soul. Although nominally set in rural Montana in the early 20th century, in fact the film goes back much further. The opening and closing passages of the memoir, quoted in voice-over in the film, make clear that director Robert Redford, like Maclean, is dealing with Adam's fall from grace, the quite different ways in which two sons of a stern Presbyterian preacher seek redemption -- one by cleaving to the teachings and expectations of his father, the other by rejecting convention and striking out on his own -- and the impossibility of knowing whether their different fates were predestined or might somehow have been avoided. This is not the usual stuff of cinema, which normally depends on standard plot devices to push the action forward -- if truth be told, Maclean's poetic and sometimes funny narrative probably succeeds better on its own terms -- but Redford makes a few small changes, takes lots of chances, and comes very close to duplicating Maclean's substance and tone. The acting is first-rate, the cinematography won awards, and the music should have. The only flaw, in my view, is that the ending of the film comes as a surprise, and thus lacks the tragic inevitability of the memoir, but don't let that stop you from seeing it. Nine stars.",/review/rw0312468/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2004,perfectbond,7," Very moving
","In The Legend of Bagger Vance, Redford showed the purity and tranquility of purpose to be found in golf. Here he does it with fly fishing. And just as he captured the period so well in that film, so, too, does he here; not only the look (notably the beautiful Montana landscape) and sound but the cultural (especially religious) folkways as well. The stars, Pitt, Skerritt, and Sheffer, are all perfectly cast and they are backed by a strong supporting cast. This movie is an excellent exposé of a rural American's journey through his formative years. Recommended, 7/10.",/review/rw0312468/?ref_=tt_urv
