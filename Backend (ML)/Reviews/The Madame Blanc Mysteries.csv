7 March 2022,Nyssareen_77,2," Started at a solid 5 and has moved downhill from there
","This show started out at a solid 5. Despite the sudden loss of the driving force of the show, the first season of The Conners seemed to do a decent job. They highlighted how an average family can weather poverty and loss while also dealing with the generational conflicts that will naturally happen when you have three generations trying to inhabit the same space without killing each other. In the second season it started slipping, and has continued to do so ever since. Now in season 4 we have reached a generous 2/10 and absolutely NONE of the original magic is left. It is almost entirely filled with this or that political/social agenda and the acting and writing have both become painful to witness. No matter what your opinion of Rosanne's politics is, anyone who is being honest has to admit that the original series was awesome (until we got to season 9 and things started to go seriously off the rails) where this show started off average at best and is now a complete dumpster fire.",/review/rw5254567/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2022,amexspam,2," How Hollywood Imagines the Lower Class Lives
","The writing of the early years of the Roseanne show was based on memories, and recent realities, of actual ""working class"" people. ""The Connors"" writers are - based on their bios - all millionaire Hollywood sexagenarians, living in Mailibu, that grew up in upper middle class homes, attended Ivy league schools, and went up from there...Top 1% clueless cultural misappropriation. This still might work if the show was at all funny, but it simply isn't.",/review/rw5254567/?ref_=tt_urv

",Is this show a joke? It seems so! The acting and parody to today's life is! Get real! The Rosanne show use to be great because real people could relate to it and it made us laugh! This crap just makes me cringe!! Stop Already!! You're all embarrassing yourselves!!,/review/rw5254567/?ref_=tt_urv

25 March 2019,janmanuel2,1," Terrible show.
","I actually thought the new reboot was a little awkward even with Roseanne. Too much political correctness interjected. I love Roseanne and her relationships with Dan and Jackie and it wasn't bad. I would have kept watching it and it may have evolved into another special show. Now that she's gone, it's so awful. Sara Gilbert cannot carry a show. She's an abrasive character. As she grew into a teen in the original series, she quickly became my least favorite character. Maybe in real life she should be greatful for the wonderful career she had due to Roseanne. This is a dark show now. The characters had many problems (mostly economic) in the first series, but they had a wonderful love for each other. I'm buying the entire series, I never tire of it. Roseanne is a very talented woman and made that show special. I'm reading comments that the negative reviews are made by people upset at her being fired. Well, you could say just the opposite about the 9s and 10s on here. Really? Even if you like the show ( go figure) is is not worthy of the highest score possible. I predict that the network will never cancel this show ever, just to make a liberal point. They will continue to prop it up no matter how much money it loses.",/review/rw5254567/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2018,ShartyMcFly,4," It just isn't working.
","I have watched all the episodes so far because I want to like this show. I loved the original and still enjoy the reruns so much. However, the new show is simply not good. I love Laurie Metcalf but she is horribly overplaying her character much like she did in the original runs last season. I don't know who told her this was the way to go, but it's awful. Goodman looks bored and seems like he's forcing his lines. Sara Gilbert seems to be trying to fill the void left by Roseanne and she's just not up to it. Darlene was an interesting teenage character but her flat, monotone one-liners just don't deliver. As for the rest of the cast, there's too many extra characters and very little character development. If I'm supposed to care about any of the grandkids, they need to be featured more than a couple minutes each week. What made the original so good was the relationships - Roseanne was at the center of that with Dan, Jackie, Becky and Darlene. I gave it a chance, I think I'll stick with the reruns and take a pass on this.",/review/rw5254567/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2021,tlharrison-59546,1," ...its bad
","I used to watch Roseanne when I was a kid. It wasn't my favorite show but I remember loving the relationship and chemistry between Roseanne and John Goodman. Laurie Metcalf did a good job as well. The rest of the cast is quite forgettable. When the show came back with Roseanne, I watched it and it was ok. It was pure nostalgia and not really any substance. When the show killed off Roseanne and became The Connors.. it went from ok to unbearable. Lately I have been revisiting the original sitcom and I'm surprised how often I find myself laughing. It makes me sad that the story was continued on and Roseanne got killed off, especially the way she did. I'm not a fan of Roseanne's personal views and opinions but this whole universe just doesn't exist without her. The show should have been axed then. The continuity of this whole story makes no sense. Dan dies. No, he really doesn't. Jackie was gay, no she really wasn't. Baby Andy comes along but he isn't in the reboot. The family wins millions but no, not really. Then Roseanne being killed off. The whole thing just went haywire but the early episodes of Roseanne are still a good watch.",/review/rw5254567/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2019,dpenna3280,1," Not good!
","I really wanted to like this show, but it is just miserable. Sara Gilbert is not funny, and Metcalf is sooo annoying I can't even get through a whole show. Roseanne was the heart of the Conner family, and they really screwed the pooch with this one!",/review/rw5254567/?ref_=tt_urv

3 August 2019,wienke-38620,1," Terrible writing with no humor
","I thought Goodman could still carry this show without Roseanne. I was wrong.
I guess this is what you get when you show zero loyalty to the woman who built your careers. Pretty disappointing ending to a really funny show.",/review/rw5254567/?ref_=tt_urv

","This show is terrible I thought the reboot was horrible too even when Roseanne was on it something about the actors is so uncomfortable. Especially this season the new woman Dan is with has the personality of cardboard, between DJs daughter and Becky I'm not sure who the worse actor is. Darlene completely lost her personality she was one of my favorite characters in the original I get it people get older but she's a completely different person and the way she says her lines have no effort put into it what so ever. Her son isn't much better of an actor and Debbie (shameless fan here) I could do without but she does favor Darlene and David facial feature wise. They didn't do much with Mark this season is all about Covid and political things. . Roseanne has always been political buts it's just so unnatural They also wrote out the baby Roseanne and Jackie had during the last seasons of the original Roseanne , this season I read that ratings are down it's obvious the actors rather be anywhere else and so would I.",/review/rw5254567/?ref_=tt_urv

21 November 2018,davelynch16,," I liked the first episode
","I see a lot of bad reviews giving 1/10 I will leave my rating until I watch it some more. I found the first episode both funny and a little touching. The jokes were similar. The same sarcastic tone. It's sort of strange that an actress can get fired from a popular show for making a comment that very few people Barr (excuse the pun) the media were following anyway, while the President of the United States can get away with just about anything. To sum up, episode one is a fitting tribute to the show's former title character. I'll give episode one 9/10 and save my rating based on the first series, of which I will be following.",/review/rw5254567/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2018,metaick,1," Roseanne!?!..without her, there's no show...
","Firing Roseanne was a huge mistake and I hope this show fails miserably!...I believe the cast should have supported her and the show would have continued on Nerflix, or Amazon or even YouTube Red....it's a sad shame today's crybaby society had to affect this show how it did....",/review/rw5254567/?ref_=tt_urv

7 October 2021,tayboboogy-1,2," No Longer Entertaining
","I grew up watching Roseanne. I loved the stories and characters. I watched the spinoff with an open mind. But it has drastically failed to uphold the legacy. First off, these characters are shells of their former selves. They're no longer ""blue collar "" everyday relatable people, but rather kind of gross.",/review/rw5254567/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2019,scottroxmphs,2," I Just Can't...
","Ok, so the whole Roseanne thing happened and now we're left with her family to carry on. I gave it a try, I really did. I'm glad they brought back the original Becky (she's my fave over Chalke) and I think it's cool they now added Peggy Bundy to the cast (yes, I know it's Katey Segal). However, it just seems like it keeps getting worse and worse for the Conners. I mean, how long can a black cloud stay over one family? This is depressing as hell. In the old days, they weren't rich by any means but they were funny and made light of it. Now it's just dark, like slit your wrists dark. I know many viewers have lots of questions like ""where's the son?"" and ""where's this character?"" and so on. My question is when did Darlene get to the point she's sleeping with two guys and fighting them off with a stick cause she's so irresistible? Am I missing something here? And the kids... no wonder David left them high and dry. I'm sure they're fine actors but the characters are really awful. Last night the wrong person got slapped. Props to Gilbert for taking that hit like a real woman. I wish Jackie would've smacked the fool out of Harris as well. Poor Dan. He drinks more than ever, looks emaciated, and doesn't want the tail thrown at him by Segal who is much hotter than any woman who has been on that show. Speaking of characters, was Matthew Broderick that desperate for a role? I mean, it's so damn dark it's not funny. It's painful to watch like a slow motion car crash. The only person who comes out winning is Roseanne. No Arnie, Crystal, or Booker. I don't think anyone can salvage this show and Dan is one of my favorite TV fathers of all-time. Just makes you miss the days of when everyone could take a joke and we weren't afraid of being so PC. We really had it good when we could laugh at ourselves and the Conners as a whole. Now I feel like there should be a toll free Help Line number at the end of every episode to donate to Becky's daughter, Jackie for The Lunchbox, DJ (just cause he's a good guy) and Dan for a six pack.",/review/rw5254567/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2018,Emma_Marie29,1," Very disappointing
","Without Roseanne this show is pointless. What made it was the interaction between Roseanne and the individual characters...especially Jackie and Dan. While John Goodman and Laurie Metcalf are still good actors, they aren't enough to make up for the bad acting from the rest of the cast. The show isn't even funny. Is it the same writers? If so, then without any doubt it was Roseanne herself that made the show.",/review/rw5254567/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2019,glendariley,1," Boring,not funny

12 October 2021,cockezville,4," Enough Already
",Laurie Metcalf looks embarrassed that she committed to this mess as she is an engaging actress and John Goodman as well . The stories are all about Darlene played by Melissa Gilbert who is a one dimensional actress. It would be nice to see Michael Fishman utilized in the cast but the sofa has more of a part. This current 4th season is a total disaster. And Jason Alexander as the southern minister is appalling. His accent is the worst. I know that Roseanne is a whack job but she at least gave the show a blue collar feel. Cancel this now!,/review/rw5254567/?ref_=tt_urv

13 November 2019,chiluvr1228,1," What a train wreck
","Roseanne and John Goodman were the only reason to watch this show. Other than Jackie the rest of the crew are horrible actors especially Becky, who I never liked, even in the original episodes. The Conner's leaves me with a lot of questions, which perhaps were addressed in later episodes. I quit watching after the first couple of episodes until last night's and it seems to have gotten even worse.",/review/rw5254567/?ref_=tt_urv
