20 January 2023,amyemcdonald-91626,1," Writers can't write or even plagiarize properly....
",This is atrocious. Read and loved the books in my youth and just watching the first episode brought back my memories of Anne Rice's fantastic world of witches. So forgive me when I'm pissed at even the littlest thing they could have gotten right. This actress is NOT Rowan. Rowan had ash blond hair and GREY eyes. I remember Rice making that clear distinction. She was not some mousy girl but had a husky voice and knew what she wanted. She was not unstable and knew she could kill and thus controlled her anger even though she didn't fully understand what was happening. This actress is terrible and is portraying a grown woman acting as if she's 14.,/review/rw8815867/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,Tweetienator,3," Disappointing
","There is one thing I can't forgive a movie, a show, a book - if it bores me to death. The adaption of Anne Rice's Mayfair Witches is such an affair - I struggled thru the first episode, episode two and three I could just get through with using a certain function called fast forwarding - a lot. This really saddens me, because I like some of Anne Rice's books a lot and some of the works of Alexandra Daddario too (lately for example We Have Always Lived in a Castle). How could a story about witches, with a Gothic touch be such a bore? I'm pretty sure that the books are of another quality, and maybe I will read them someday. Anyway, the show is not a total crash because production and acting are sufficient enough, but I won't recommend this one to you.",/review/rw8815867/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,wifeofmrbeavers,4," Did they read the books?!?!
","Why take over a beloved series and totally change it? 2 episodes in and I am throughly disappointed that there is no Aaron Lightner and Michael Curry. If you had read the books, you know how central these characters are. They didn't even get the emerald right!! There are so many descriptions for that important piece of jewelry. The cast has no influence on how the writers portray this story. I think they are working with the mediocrity they were given. Guess watch it if you need something to watch but don't look for the book in this series. I was so excited and now I will just go read the series again. Kinda let down.",/review/rw8815867/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,ikata-49417,1," Boring
","Slow, drawn out, base and uninteresting. Lifetime and CW get it on. Bah! I never read the books, although I did read the Vampire Chronicles, so I'm familiar with Anne Rice's writing style. This does not strike me as her work. But again, I did not read the Mayfair Witches books. Regardless, this show is boring and uninteresting. And so is the current Vampire series. However, I did enjoy the 1994 and 2002 movies. So my take away is the modern versions are boring and stupid. This is consistent with almost every other show and movie in recent years. Most of what comes out these days is so poorly written, even when it's drawn from good source material, it is unwatchable. This show is more of that. There is an entire generation of incompetent, inept buffoons faking it at being writers in the entertainment industry and they keep putting out crap shows. When I hear about a show that might interest me, I just assume it will be bad, and I'm rarely wrong. The only new show I liked from 2022 was Wednesday. We are suffering through the dark ages of entertainment and the plague has swept through and killed off all the beloved IPs.",/review/rw8815867/?ref_=tt_urv

","As soon as I read that the Michael Curry and Aaron Lightner characters would not be in the series, I had my doubts, because they are both central and essential to the story. I love these books love them. Anne Rice not only tells a story, she creates an atmosphere. But, I decided to watch with an open mind. Sometimes adapted films and series can be better than the original, or at least as good. Terms of Endearment, Jaws, to name a couple. Atmosphere is completely lacking here. Granted, I've only seen one episode, and I will watch the second episode to see if it gets any better, but I do not have high hopes. Rowan is not Anne Rice's Rowan; not even close. I don't like this actress as Rowan at all. She played Constance in the film We Have Always Lived In The Castle (another absolute favorite book of mine), and did a good job, IMO. But she's not pulling off Rowan. Neither is Carlotta. It's like they are caricatures. Overall, the acting of all characters so far is very disappointing. Except Annabeth Gish. I think she captured the catatonic Deirdre very well. I haven't decided about Lasher yet. I'm so sad. When I heard The Witching Hour was being made into a series, I thought, it's about time, and I was so excited. Why do producers and writers think they can improve on a bestselling and beloved story by one of the most popular writers of my lifetime? It's such a shame.",/review/rw8815867/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2023,blueser53,2," Abomination
","This series is an absolute abomination. Poor Anne Rice must be rolling over in her grave. Why buy the rights to a masterpiece of writing and then utterly ignore it's content? The Midnight Hour is one of my all time favorite books. The story, the beautiful prose and the historical research that that goes into all her books to make them utterly believable and authentic feeling. This is such a disappointment. This will definitely alienate the fans of her stories which are the exact audience they are seeking to make this series successful. This does not even resemble The Mayfair Witches story that Anne Rice wrote and so many of us have read. I don't understand and I'm so disappointed. After two excruciating episodes, I will be checking out.",/review/rw8815867/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2023,wvyxmzzz,3," Highly Disappointing!
","A gross injustice to Anne Rice's ""Mayfair Witches"" in storytelling. Omitting main characters who are an integral part in storylines & rest of the books in the series, timelines are off, character attributes & casting was hit & miss at best. After watching the first two episodes, I was so frustrated with the show's writers. I had high hopes for this series because I thought AMC did a pretty good job in their adaptation of ""Interview with a Vampire"" from Anne Rice's ""Vampire Chronicles"", but I've been thoroughly disappointed in this adaptation. I really doubt that the rest of the first season is even worth watching at this point.",/review/rw8815867/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,auburndancellc,2," Why mess with success?
","The Witching Hour by Anne Rice was my favorite of all of her books, and I have been waiting for someone to address it in movie or tv form. And yet from the beginning, the writers were compelled to completely change the story, add stuff that's irrelevant, omit salient points and turn the plot sideways until it is completely unrecognizable.",/review/rw8815867/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,ericdhall77,5," Boring
","I CANNOT be the only one here that found this completely boring. It was like watching Twilight only with a ""witch"" cast. They only difference is the first episode is sparkly vampires could half way hold my attention. I understand it's more of a drama but geesh, put some kind of action in there to hold someone's attention. I rated this a five because hopefully it will pick up through the season but if the rest of the season is like this first episode, there will not be a second season. Snoozefests like this episode are like something you find on Amazon and they turn into a C rated, terrible horror film.",/review/rw8815867/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,ezviewer,3," Why?
","If you have read the books, then don't watch the series because it will break your heart. Anne Rice would be turning in her grave and you can guarantee that those parties involved with overseeing her legacy don't give a damn about it! Shame on you and your lack of integrity!!",/review/rw8815867/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,Willougher,3," Gross Deviation
","They could just have titled this AMC's Mayfair Witches instead of Anne Rice's Mayfair Witches as this series surely does not resemble Anne Rice's Mayfairs that have moved and astounded me in the books. I have hoped and waited for a movie (or TV) adaptation of the Mayfairs as it truly is such a deeply rich and compelling read - a force within a force in itself. But this series, plainly put, is a gross deviation. I understand adapting a story to modern times like perhaps driving a current brand of car or using latest cellphone models in there but to significantly move away from such a great story that has been so well grounded and writ and detailed as Anne Rice had done for the Mayfairs, is appalling - it's an injustice as like they are riding on the incredible ingenuity of a created story, then think they could ""cooly"" make it their own. Perhaps this kind of approach applies to many other stories out there but it certainly does not for Anne Rice's Lives of The Mayfair Witches. As for the actor choices, perhaps most of them are great in their own right and place - but none of them fit the actual Mayfair book characters, except maybe the one for Carlotta Mayfair that came close.",/review/rw8815867/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,thedivide,7," Fun watch so far, but.. Lasher looks like an aging playboy

23 January 2023,sareed1971,1," No real resemblance to the book
","I have no idea how Anne Rice's legacy is being handled, but based on this cheap adaptation they certainly are not bothering themselves with ensuring quality productions to honor the essence of the books. You'd think with such a huge fan base attention would be paid to faithfully follow the story of the Mayfair Witches. For starters, the show has dropped two major characters from the books and other storylines are simply being ignored.",/review/rw8815867/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,NullUnit,3," Perhaps I'm just not the demographic this is aiming at...
","I didn't read the books. Didn't know there were books. I detest ""reviews"" that are actually more comparisons than review.

20 January 2023,bthigdon,3," Never read the books and have no dog in this fight
","This show is really boring. Alexandra Daddario is a world class beauty and she's a competent actress but the character is lifeless. Maybe there's a point in that, but there doesn't seem to be anything likable about her character. Her intentions are good but she's impulsive and self sabotaging. It wasn't long before I lost interest. I'll let the season play out and if I hear good things I'll come back. Really disappointed because this should've been a sure thing. Charming actress, witches are badass, awesome location and all from the mind of Anne Rice. Seems like it should've been a lot sexier too. What happened?",/review/rw8815867/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,FilmFanatic2023,3," A Disappointing and Underwhelming Addition to the Supernatural Drama Genre
","A supernatural drama series about the women of the wealthy and mysterious Mayfair family, a lineage of witches that spans generations and deals with themes of grief, self-discovery, and the patriarchy. The series follows Alexandra Daddario as Rowan, a neurosurgeon who gains the ability to burst people's brains and embarks on a journey to discover her birth mother, Deirdre (Annabeth Gish), who has been in a silent, catatonic state for years. The series also introduces the Talamasca, a secret society of witch-protectors, and the manipulative and dangerous Lasher (Jack Huston).",/review/rw8815867/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,towe-51620,3," Anne Rice books don't transfer to the screen well.
",This is another Anne Rice series set in NOLA and is dark which I like but Daddaario and her voice not to mention her acting is the worst Dr I've ever seen on any screen. This jumps around too much and I find it hard to follow with all the switching back and forth! Some authors books do not make good movies and she's one of them. This is going to be one of those 6-8 seasons worth of garbage because the normal person will be intrigued by all that is going on & last but least all the eye candy in the show will have every chronic self pleasurer glued to the set! The Originals is the best monster/school tv series yet made and it was amazing!,/review/rw8815867/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2023,eireoakie-971-215775,6," Michael Curry
","I have a HUGE problem with the fact that there is no Michael Curry in this show. How could they leave him out? He's too important and it's as much his story as Rowan's. To me, he's the heart of the first book - not to mean the center, but the actual heart. And I know Anne Rice put so much of herself into his character as far as his personality, beliefs, background, even the surname Curry is from her own family. He's practically the male version of herself. It seems unforgivable to just leave him behind.",/review/rw8815867/?ref_=tt_urv
