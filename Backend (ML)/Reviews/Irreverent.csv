19 April 2008,C-Younkin,2," Worst of Pacino's Career
","Al Pacino is one of those few actors whose career is so decorated and quality that you literally would see the biggest piece of crap in the world just to see what he would do in it. Over the years I've watched boring (Simone), long and preachy (Angels in America), and just bad (Oceans Thirteen, Two For the Money) movies primarily because he's the Godfather, Lt. Frank Slade, Serpico, and Scarface to me and he always will be. He embodies greatness and respectability, even in crap, and so I keep going back. 88 Minutes is not crap though, it's less than crap. It's amateur night at the script-o-rama. ",/review/rw2439254/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2017,mistertcj,7," Reviewers make me mad!!! Now it's my turn to do the same to you!!
","I really do have to laugh at some people's reviews at times, and over the years, if I totally believe all the bad press that some (if not all) films receive, it would never ever be worth my while visiting a cinema or buying a DVD ever again. If I see a film, like it, and then see all the bad reviews I am sometimes left thinking 'am I the only one that got it?' or 'am I the only one that thought this was good'. In short, reading too many reviews can drive you absolutely insane. OK, so 88 Minutes received largely negative reviews......especially on IMDb. So at the time of writing this, the film has a rating of 5.9, which I class as just above average (5 is average right?). I am more than just a little annoyed that most of those that gave the film an above average rating failed to review it. However, it leaves me with the conclusion that most people are more than happy to complain, rather than go with the flow. After all, I don't think that here are many films for which I haven't read a review from somebody saying that it's the worst film they've ever seen. 88 Minutes, in my opinion is a good, above average, watchable movie. But some of the contradictory comments on people's reviews did my head in. For example:- Al Pacino's performance............Al Pacino is undoubtedly a brilliant actor. His character in this movie is cocky, self assured, calm and in his opinion, always right. Pacino plays this perfectly, so why do people think that he was out of place? Was there any need for him overstate and overact? No there wasn't. Did he look uncomfortable in his role? No he didn't. To me, maybe the reviewers were expecting some powerhouse acting which they didn't receive. The plot.........come on people!!! It wasn't muddled. It was easy to follow. Throwaway yes, but don't we, every now and again enjoy a film that we don't have to think too much about? Yes we do!! It is true to say there is a certain degree of implausibility about things but people should just look at the movie for what it is.......entertainment. I, for one, was entertained, although I did guess who was behind the killings. I mean come on, even true stories have that certain implausibility factor about them in order to make them entertaining...don't they? The acting........it seems that because Pacino's performance was (rightly) understated, everybody else acted badly. It is true that some performances did not bring out the best in the actors (Alicia Witt and Leelee Sobieski), others were excellent, especially William Forsythe and Neal McDonaugh.

21 December 2009,ma-cortes,6," Frantic and exciting thriller with good performances from Al Pacino and his nemesis Neal McDonough
","Tense and suspenseful thriller film with a stunning race against time. This Hichcockian movie deals about a forensic psychologist and University professor with tortured past named Jack Grimm (Al Pacino ) who receives a phone call telling him which has only eighty eight minutes to live. Jack was witness on trail against serial killer Jon Foster (Neal McDonough)and influenced the tribunal to condemn him to death row. In narrow time he desperately seeks to communicate with a problematic student (Ben McKenzie,OC), his associate Shelby (Amy Brenneman), assistant (Alicia Witt), his friend and FBI agent(William Forsythe), a security guard (Brendan Fletcher) and University dean (Deborah Kara Unger). Meanwhile being pursued by a delinquent (Stephen Moyer) and besieged by numerous threatening cellular calls.",/review/rw2439254/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2008,siderite,5," Really weak! Bad plot and lame acting
","I don't think that Al Pacino is a bad actor. I know he can act and he can do it well. Maybe he was just annoyed with the quality of the script. Or maybe he needed a quick buck. I have no idea what happened in this film, but the results were dreadful.",/review/rw2439254/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2007,AudioFileZ,6," Good but mostly only because of Al Pacino
",This movie uses time to create some urgency and a fairly fast pace to keep interest. These devices are used effectively so that combined with Al Pacino and a decent script we have an interesting thriller.,/review/rw2439254/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2007,lukas8,3," There is a good reason why they don't want to release it
","This is such a poor movie, it is unbelievable. Especially considering it has such a solid actor like Al Pacino. Fans of his will wish they never saw it.",/review/rw2439254/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2007,RhyanScorpioRhys,1," 88 Minutes of Subpar Thriller Fare
","I will not discuss any of the plot point of the film, as I do not wish to spoil any ""surprises"", but I will say that it's a sad state of affairs that a movie of this caliber is considered even nearly good. The characters are one dimensional, the plot trodding on all-too-familiar themes, and the acting is abysmal. Al Pacino, who used to be a fine actor, sleep walks his way through this movie and delivers the exact same performance as he did in ""Two For The Money"", ""Insomnia"", ""People I Know"" and ""Simone"" (I will admit I liked him in ""Merchant of Venice""). This movie is not superb...it's not even good. Al, this is a wake up call to please return to the realm of acting instead of collecting the first paycheck that comes your way.",/review/rw2439254/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2009,Hitchcoc,4," Formulaic and Manipulative
","I got hooked into this movie like I would a TV police/CSI/Criminal Minds type of show (most of which are superior to this). Once I'd made the investment, I needed to see how it ended. All the while, I kept saying to myself, ""This is really quite bad!"" First of all, it pulls up every crime story clich√© there is. The use of the time limit before his death, the list of potential suspects, all of whom seem either trustworthy or guilty as hell, exploding cars, guns fired through doors, and Pacino running around looking like he is going to explode at any minute. Not to mention the incredible number of resources this guy has at his disposal. I don't know what kind of money he makes, but his network, controlled by his lesbian assistant, Amy Brennemen, is beyond belief. He commands her to find things out and they are there within a couple minutes. Then there's the condemned man who may be setting this all up. Then there's the little sister he felt he betrayed and whose death has contributed to his considerable angst. It is a lot of sound and fury, really signifying nothing in a big way. With a little subtlety and some verisimilitude, a movie like this could work, especially with a pretty good cast--this ain't it.",/review/rw2439254/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2008,dead47548,1," Even worse than the critics are saying.
","Despite all of the horrific reviews it has received, I went into this film expecting a flawed but entertaining thriller. Nothing could have prepared me for the disaster this film is. The premise is pretty simple; forensic psychologist Jack Gramm (Al Pacino) receives a call saying that he has 88 minutes to live on the day that one of the men he put in jail is sentenced to die. This sloppy, horribly put together plot unfolds onward with bomb threats, exploding cars and suspicious characters every which way and it's one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen. The story is just ludicrous containing so many contrived details that I had to fight back the urge to bust into severe laughter. There's an ex-boyfriend that ultimately has nothing to do with the plot, sexual 'tension' with every single woman on screen and for some reason there are a bounty of young, immensely attractive females who want to bang Al Pacino even though he honestly looks like he's about to fall into his coffin throughout the entire film. And Leelee Sobieski gives what may just be the worst performance I've ever seen. Just terrible. Oh, and the twist? You know those thrillers where killers have sincere motives? Yeah, this isn't one of them.",/review/rw2439254/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2010,moviesleuth2,4," Lost potential
","Real-time thrillers have an inborn sense of urgency that other thrillers can't replicate: we see everything happen as it is happening, and thus we are with the characters every step of the way. I'll be willing to admit that making this kind of a movie would be hard to pull off, since every shot has to be perfectly placed, and no scene can really be edited out. However, we should be able to expect a film that's better than this, especially if it stars acting legend Al Pacino.",/review/rw2439254/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2009,ny_kv,6," People were over Exaggerating... Its not THAT bad...
","I think that what people read our reviews is to find out whether or not the movie is worth the time or whether they should watch it so lets cut the crappy ""I need attention"" reviews okay... Yeah its worth the watch... it was fun and suspenseful to some people. Bottom line here is that it will not bore you. Have time on your hands? Need to watch a movie you haven't seen? then just got for it. You will not be blown away but you will be entertained for the hour and 42 minutes it runs.",/review/rw2439254/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2009,dunmore_ego,4," 87 Minutes Too Long.
","In 88 MINUTES, Al Pacino is FBI forensic psychiatrist Jack Gramm, who puts away a serial killer, Jon Forster (crazy-eyed Neal McDonough) and gets a phone call on Forster's scheduled execution day - a Darth Voice telling him he has 88 minutes left to live.",/review/rw2439254/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2008,jeanbal,2," My my, how bad this movie is...
","Al Pacino has been a great actor. Maybe the best of his generation, but when was it? Watching 88 Minutes I kept wondering why he was unable to close his mouth. Well, he seems to have problems to use his jaw muscles to just ""close his mouth"". And when he tries to run or jump stairs, what we see is just an old man limping badly. Worst of all, he is no more able to act with any credibility. He tries to look young and full of life, but really looks like an rippled alcoholic. But the worst is, of course, the movie itself. Inane plot (""You'll die in 88 minutes but I will try to kill you before...""), bad cinematography (have you noticed how many phone calls there is in this movie? 30? 40?), filming clich√©s (everytime there is a car trip, the car is filmed from above. How original!). And Pacino is surrounded by very pretty (and young) girls who are in love with him. How pathetic. If you really like the ""real"" Al Pacino, don't even think to watch this film. You might be pushed to think that extraterrestrials have replaced him with a bad copy.",/review/rw2439254/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2008,manubezamat,7," Good for a thriller, not as bad as people are saying
","I actually had pretty low expectations for '88 minutes' since Al Pacino's parts in 'two for the money' and 'ocean's 13', for instance, didn't exactly impress me, but it turned out I had more good things than bad things to say about this film after watching it.",/review/rw2439254/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2009,Buddy-51,2," Hall of Infamy stinker
","In ""88 Minutes,"" a gimmicky crime thriller directed by Jon Avnet, Al Pacino plays Jack Gramm, a forensic psychiatrist and university professor whose testimony played a crucial role in the conviction of a serial killer nine years earlier. Now, on the day the man is to be executed, Jack receives an anonymous phone call informing him that he has only 88 minutes to live. Could it be that the doomed-to-die convict has found a way to exact his own form of personal vengeance before heading off to that great big penitentiary in the sky? ",/review/rw2439254/?ref_=tt_urv

23 March 2010,gary-444,4," A Rare Pacino Dud
","A curious offering. The premise that the film's star, a hot-shot forensic psychiatrist, Jack Gramm,is given 88 minutes to live by an unknown assassin on the end of a phone, is a good one. Pacino is a fine actor. The plot twists and turns, is fast paced, and has a dramatic conclusion as the dead ends disappear, and the ""reveal"" in the final act unfolds. Add in some salacious sado-masochistic sex scenes and you should have the ingredients of a ""gritty"" psychological thriller. But for some reason the total is considerably less than the sum of the parts.",/review/rw2439254/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2010,lathe-of-heaven,4," Whew... Seriously, where do I start...???
","Man... Well, first off I promise I'm not a 'Troll' and I'm not going to say something brainless and general like 'worst movie ever' because it isn't : ) However... after thinking about it honestly, I THINK what this film is, is a good example of what probably could have been a good film and I don't know WHAT the hell was done to it, but man oh man... the result is literally STUNNINGLY awful. Immediately I thought that it's GOT to be the director, it HAS to be! But, I checked and I GUESS the guy credited with it did direct 'RIGHTEOUS KILL' which was quite good. Then I saw in the Trivia section that he replaced the guy who directed 'CONFIDENCE' which was a wonderfully BRILLIANT film. So, what the heck went wrong?!!",/review/rw2439254/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2009,VetteRanger,8," Pacino delivers again
",I've read some comments from people who couldn't understand this movie. That's predictable from the 'video game generation' of movie viewers whose idea of a deep plot is a high body count from automatic weapons. LOL ,/review/rw2439254/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2010,gazzo-2,5," Pretty bad, sure.
",You won't get much of an argument from me here. (I saw it on You Tube-some guy has it broken down in 10 parts save for the first few minutes. Save yourself the price of a rental and do that instead) Everyone involved just seems kinda lost-Pacino phones it in-barely scratching the surface of 'Good late Pacino' in the Insider or Heat. He's not convincing. His wig is awful and acts as a running gag.,/review/rw2439254/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2007,cinegal-2,2," Watchable only because it is mesmerizingly bad...
","Hard to believe an actor of Pacino's stature could end up starring in this mess! The ""plot"" barely makes sense, and the roster of suspects makes it obvious right off the bat who the ""mystery psycho"" will turn out to be. Pacino is a Professor of ""Forensic Psychiatry"" (a specialty of dubious believability at best) who apparently works at a University with only one finished building where every student takes his class, and they all park in the same garage. Set in rainy Seattle, the biggest mystery here is why it is pouring on Pacino's speeding taxi, but once it rounds a corner an exterior shot shows a sunny day complete with pedestrians apparently staring and pointing at the film crew. Another head scratcher involves Pacino's ever changing hair length, style, and color all during an 88 minute period--guess he made a few stops at Supercuts in the midst of solving his own murder.",/review/rw2439254/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2008,Fredolow,1," I haven't seen anything quite this bad in a long time!
","Awful awful AWFUL - this film really was a stinker, and I'm quite astonished at the number of good comments it's receiving on here. What on Earth Al Pacino was thinking of getting involved in something this dire is quite beyond me - perhaps money, but damage to reputation alone I would have thought to be adequate reason to steer well away. The script was strewn with clich√©s which managed to bring out the worst in everyone. The actress who played his sidekick for the 3rd quarter of the film looked completely lost, struggling vainly to add some meaning to her lines, with the long, poorly composed two-shots only prolonging the agony. Character development was thin at best and the fast-paced attempt at storytelling only led to one farce after another, making the whole thing completely laughable.",/review/rw2439254/?ref_=tt_urv
