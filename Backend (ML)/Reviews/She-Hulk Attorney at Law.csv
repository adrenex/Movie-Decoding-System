9 December 2020,planktonrules,6," A very good film...provided you are a fan already.
","If you've never seen the first two Bill & Ted movies, I suggest you pass on ""Bill & Ted Face the Music"". While this third film isn't bad, it certainly isn't as fun and original as the previous two...and it might also prove to be very confusing. But, if you are a fan already of the series, you'll enjoy this film provided you don't expect the impossible...for the film to recapture 100% of the charm and humor of the originals. Adjust your expectations and you will surely like the film.",/review/rw6051718/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2021,youngcollind,7," Goofy franchise gets victory lap
","Maybe coming from a place of bias for having loved the originals as a young 'un, I can't help but respect the team for having another go at such a stupid premise. An A lister like Keanu could have scoffed it off and went back to making Oscar bids, but instead swallowed his pride and returned to the dopey character that kickstarted his career. It properly pays homage to the feel of the originals, bouncing from one illogical time travel scenario to another, never taking itself seriously and roping in a couple celebrity cameos who also seem to be just enjoying the ride. It nods to how absolutely ludicrous the idea of a ""song that unites the world"" is while still maintaining that earnest 80s belief that rock 'n roll can save your soul.",/review/rw6051718/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2020,BrickNash,7," Not a patch on the first two, but fun for fans
","It's ""ok"".",/review/rw6051718/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2020,davebartle,5," It's okay and better than I expected for a movie made in the dying days of Hollywood
","We have to face facts, the reason there are so many sequels and remakes of movies from the 80s and 90s is because Hollywood peaked then. The 2000's marked the beginning of the decline, which has been rapidly descending in the last few years.
Despite this decline and despite the mediocre Force Awakens style influences in the script, the charm and humour... and of course the nostalgia saves this from being unwatchable, which is high praise.
Zazz as the robot steals the show along with the woman from Flight of the Concordes but I mostly left feeling a little sad that this movie wasn't made in the 90s and sad that Keane Reeves may not actually be immortal.",/review/rw6051718/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2021,nlgthunder,8," It was good for what it was meant to be
","I was thoroughly entertained by this installment of Bill and Ted. Loved the way it incorporated so much about music. This movie, having been meant to be stupid-funny and being a 25 years later revisit, was a good movie. It was a fun way to spend 90 minutes.",/review/rw6051718/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2020,Erlik_Han,3," Didn't laugh a single time
","So first off. It was very very predictable from the start that the two daughters would end up ""saving the day"".",/review/rw6051718/?ref_=tt_urv

31 August 2020,b_trought,5," I REALLY wanted to like this
","I loved Bill & Ted! I watched the movies, cartoon, started saying 'dude' and bogus because of it, and hoped that this would be a nostalgic look back to my early teens. And it kind of was, in a way. And there was a sweetness in watching Bill&Ted again fumble their way to saving the world/universe/reality.",/review/rw6051718/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2020,DeadMansTrousers,8," It may not be perfect but it made me laugh
","I grew up watching the original Bill & Ted movies on repeat and I always wanted more. I even watched the cartoon series and loved it. When they finally announced another film I was excited and nervous but the truth is everything about this movie is exactly what it needs to be. They kept the humor and tone from the original films while updating the soundtrack with relevant music and it all works. I wasn't disappointed with anything about this movie and I honestly enjoyed the daughters and the actresses who played them, they nailed the mannerisms and tone of Bill and Ted.",/review/rw6051718/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2021,cherold,5," Like the first two movies if you took all the jokes out
","When I saw there was a new B&T movie I thought these old men playing those same characters was bound to be terrible, but then I saw all these film critics saying that the movie actually turned out quite well. I wish I'd seen the movie they saw, because this one was pretty bad.",/review/rw6051718/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2020,evagreen-106,2," Some things better to be left in the past
","I was worried it's going to be bad and yes it is bad. Cringefest!
Not funny at all. No jokes. Keanu's face looks like he's made of wax, there's no life in them.
And seriously did you really need everyone to be a woman, their children, people in the future?? The daughters were cringe to watch too.
I only gave it 2 stars as I like Keanu Reeves as a person.",/review/rw6051718/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2020,marmar-69780,7," Bill and Ted Face the Music
","Bill and Ted Face the Music may actually be the weakest of a entire trilogy but it was still a fun watch and it was great to see all this characters back together after a very long time.When i said that is film is the weakest one from the rest,i didnt mean it in a bad way,cause truth is that first two films had that teenage charm around that that was packed in a good 80s and 90s charm but here they decided to modernized a story for a bit..Our girl characters were fun but they were little to simple and like just a girl copy of Bill and Ted,also some scenes were little unfunny cause they work only when you are younger age,so it was weird also to see Keanu and Alex acting this way in their 50s.Bill and Ted Face the Music was a fun film to see but it isnt on level of first two",/review/rw6051718/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2020,Sergiodave,3," No!
","The only reason I gave it 3 stars was out of nostalgia. It worked brilliantly when they were in their 20's, but now it looks stale and at times cringe worthy. The Godfather Part III was a better ending to a trilogy than this.",/review/rw6051718/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2020,SnoopyStyle,7," needs more Death
",Bill Preston (Alex Winter) and Ted Logan (Keanu Reeves) are still struggling to write their epic song. They have broken up with Death (William Sadler). They start couples counselling with the Princesses. Rufus' daughter Kelly (Kristen Schaal) arrives from the future with a dire warning. Space and time is unraveling. They need to write the song right away to save existence. Their daughters Thea (Samara Weaving) and Billie (Brigette Lundy-Paine) try to help by assembling the greatest band ever.,/review/rw6051718/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2020,thebricks,1," Atrocious, needed to be made 15-20 years ago
","Biggest fault of this movie is taking the main characters and changing NOTHING about them. They're dads, they raised kids. They just wouldn't be the same guys they were 30 years ago. The daughters are exactly like them. That's just weird and it isn't funny. There was an opportunity for drama that just wasn't exploited, considering how much music tastes have changed since then.",/review/rw6051718/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2020,kosmasp,8," Part 3? No way Dude! Yes way Dude!
","If you think the first two were great or just one of the other Bill and Ted movies and say this doesn't do anything for the series, you probably have a very romantic view on the first movies. This actually is a really good continuation of what made the other movies good (if that's what you thought of them). Actually adding adult/grown-up versions (some time has passed the movie has to acknowledge that) of their daughters is an amazing idea. Especially because they are Daddys girls and behave quite Dude like ... which is fun in my humble opinion, but I would guess some would find annoying.",/review/rw6051718/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2020,TheTruthofItIs,2," Bill & Ted Bogus Movie
","OMG, FtM was such a wasted opportunity! EVERYONE phoned this one in! The originals' writers, the fairly accomplished director and most of the principal actors, just a really half ast effort all around. Keanu was still as wooden as cheap furniture, face basically botox-frozen. The first two films, Excel Adv and Bogus J'ney, are fun to watch every 5 yrs or so, but this travesty has no re-watchability, it's just junk! The movie's plot itself doesn't even make sense, since at the end of Bogus Journey the world did come together, one of the headlines read ""Bill & Ted Tour Mideast: Peace Achieved"" and the final headline was ""Wyld Stallyns to play Mars - Station!"" So the whole premise for FtM was just a fraud. Count yourself lucky you didn't pay $10+ for this.",/review/rw6051718/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2020,greggman,4," Dude! This is so, Non, Non Heinous

29 August 2020,The_nibs,3," Rushed mess of a film
","Loved the originals, I didn't expect this to be good, and I'm so glad we didn't pay to see it because I would've been peeved. There are a couple of jokes in the beginning that were funny, but it fizzles out thereafter. There's no real plot here, the characters have no depth, it's not like they did in the original movies but there weren't so many of them thrown together in one film that it made it feel chaotic and disengaging. Mostly I felt like there wasn't any cohesion whatsoever, it felt as though the script was thrown together in a single night and rushed into production to satisfy fans. The biggest let down is the music, the music is awful. How do you have Dave Grohl cameo and not play? I just don't understand that. Instead we get Kid Cuddi pumping up the crowd (he doesn't sing, which I'm thankful for, but then why is he even there?). Part of what made the Bill and Ted franchise appealing to fans was that it occurred when metal was at it's height, instead of trying to appeal to those same fans, who probably still listen to metal, they instead tried to amalgamate every music genre in the world to appeal to everyone, and it comes off as just that, a hot mess of musical genres. Coupled with a poor script and two actors who look less than enthused to reprise their roles, this film isn't worth rewatching.",/review/rw6051718/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2020,TxMike,," Now the kids get in on the action, to save the world!
","The first thing I want to write is - unless you watched and enjoyed the prior ""Bill and Ted"" movies then you really ought to skip this one. While it is silly and juvenile it is done in such a winning manner that it is totally enjoyable.",/review/rw6051718/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2020,salfmus,3," Very Dull Bill and Ted Movie
",I really enjoyed the first two movies but this one was very boring. It lacked of the former edge of the series; it was way too sanitized and politically correct. The result is a soulless Bill and Ted with no charm and fun.,/review/rw6051718/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2020,morpheuszion-61578,3," Kid Cudi? Really, dude?
","Oh my, oh my...what do we have here? I loved Bill and Ted as a kid, watched it a couple of times as 30yr old dude...it was still great. But this? We will try and forget it.
Hollywood, please, dudes. If you haven't made a sequel in 5-10 years, 15 tops, don't make it after 20-30 (or more!?) years. You lost your soul, your touch. You'll never be able to make classics again. Why? Because you're doing it for the money, not true fans. Let old classics be. And don't even dare to make Matrix 4. FRIENDS are going to be a disaster, too, btw. That's just the way you are now. See ya.",/review/rw6051718/?ref_=tt_urv
