24 December 2014,BA_Harrison,5," Neither sexy nor funny enough.
","Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel play married couple Annie and Jay, who are dismayed to realise that leading a hectic family life has had a seriously negative impact on their physical relationship. When they find themselves with an evening free from the kids, the couple decide to try and revitalise their love-life by filming themselves performing EVERY position from 70s manual The Joy of Sex. The proverbial hits the fan, however, when the couple realise in horror that their current iPad has synced their home-made porn with all of the other tablets they have previously owned-tablets that they have given away as gifts to various friends and associates.",/review/rw3114795/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2014,3xHCCH,3," The Trailer is Better Than the Whole Film!
","When they were just dating, Jay and Annie had the best sex anywhere and anytime. Since they got married and had kids though, their sexual activity dipped to below zero. One frustrating night when their attempts for sex were going nowhere, Annie hits on the idea to take a video of themselves having sex to make things more exciting. Aroused by the camera, they had a three-hour sex marathon following all the positions prescribed in the book ""The Joy of Sex"".",/review/rw3114795/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2014,trublu215,2," A really poor comedy
","Sex Tape tells the tale of a couple who, as the title suggest, make a sex tape and it gets leaked. Now this is a perfect example of a great concept that morphs into a really bland and unfunny movie. Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal play a bored married couple trying to spice things up. For the sake of the film, these characters are needed but the actors in the roles are surprisingly typecast at this point. Jason Segal plays an R-rated version of his How I Met Your Mother character and it doesn't exactly benefit him at this point because these are the roles he is now stuck in. He's very good at what he does but this is the one film where his performance grows weary about mid way through. Cameron Diaz isn't much better either, while she does generate a couple chuckles it still isn't nearly enough to help it. The supporting cast featuring Rob Lowe and Rob Corddry do generate most of the laughs, it again doesn't make for anything of a redeeming quality. Jake Kasdan directs from a poorly executed screenplay that features a great idea and glimpses of its genius in some of its twists but they are not enough to set this comedy apart from the million other R rated comedies that have come and gone. Much like Bad Teacher, this film has maybe two good scenes while the rest become bogged down with useless crude jokes for the sake of having a R rating. Overall, Sex Tape marks another disappointing comedy with its overtly crude for the sake of being crude scenes and flat performances.",/review/rw3114795/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2014,Red_Identity,," Pretty bad
","This is the problem with going out with friends who have very different taste in films than you... you get dragged to go see stuff like this, stuff that you would have otherwise not seen. I've gotten really tired of Jason Segal doing his usual comedy routine in everything he comes out in. I'm so sick of him. Cameron Diaz is charming enough and definitely does her best, but there's just so much one can do with the material. The supporting performances aren't bad, in particular Rob Lowe who is pretty hilarious. The scenes in his house are easily the only good thing about the film, and seeing as how that part was pretty hilarious, I can't give it such a lower score.",/review/rw3114795/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2015,bowmanblue,7," Not (quite) as bad as it's made out to be
","Okay, in case you haven't already heard, 'Sex Tape' has been pretty much slated everywhere. Currently it's up for goodness knows how many 'Razzie' awards for how bad it is. And, if you check out the online reviews, you'll see that most people pretty much agreed with its nominations.",/review/rw3114795/?ref_=tt_urv

",If you don't want your sex video to get out don't make one. If you don't want to be embarrassed by the release of a bad movie don't make it as it will get out. Cameron Diaz is capable of better as she has proved it. Jason Segal does his best work with Muppets. Even Rob Lowe and Jack Black are given nothing to do.,/review/rw3114795/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2014,dc_max,1," One of the worst movies...
","I don't like to be negative, but I feel obligated to help save the rest of the world from wasting their hard earned money on this movie. This is just about the worst movie I can recall ever seeing in my entire life in the movie theater, and I have seen more movies than anyone I know. There were about 10 minutes of this movie that I can honestly say were funny, but the remaining 84 minutes were just complete and utter agony. The movie takes the concepts of silly and campy to new lows. The movie is laden with deliberate and unintelligent attempts at campy humor, but every attempt falls flat. The concept behind the movie was great, but the execution simply does not measure up. Disappointed! Can I get my money back?",/review/rw3114795/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2014,RyanCShowers,," Shallow and perverted
","Cameron Diaz headlined a shoddy comedy that opened earlier in 2014, ""The Other Woman"", but instead of improving from the mistake of choosing that script to further her career, Diaz outdoes her poor script selection with ""Sex Tape"". The adjective ""atrocious"" was used in numerous film reviews in describing ""Sex Tape"". Atrocious is such a jarring word, it sounds like it could tear skin if used too aggressively. The term should only be used selectively, but the quality of the screenplay used to produce ""Sex Tape"" creates justifiable cause to snort that word every second of the feeble film.",/review/rw3114795/?ref_=tt_urv

3 January 2015,smatysia,6," Mildly amusing
","Well a lot of vitriol has been spewed on this site about this movie. Particularly with comedies, filmmakers never know what will tickle the fancy of the movie-going public. They have to throw a lot of stuff at the wall and see what sticks. The script for, say, ""Caddyshack"" had to have looked so sophomoric that the suits must have thought themselves crazy to green-light that project, but it made a fortune and is now considered a classic comedy. This film was filled with crude humor and an okay premise, but it turned out okay. I found it mildly amusing, and the beautiful Cameron Diaz held my interest. I've certainly seen a lot worse.",/review/rw3114795/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2014,DarkVulcan29,3," Tries to be funny, but ends up being annoying instead.
","What happened to Cameron Diaz, there was a time she was making descent movies to watch and enjoy, like The Holiday(2006), My Sister's Keeper(2009), and Knight and Day(2010) to name a few. Now it seems that she seems to going in a steadily decline with such films like Bad Teacher(2011), What To Expect When Your Expecting(2012), and now Sex Tape.",/review/rw3114795/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2014,agacyb,1," complete boring garbage
","I can't remember the last time I wanted to walk out of a movie; there are times I fall asleep but it's rare that I'm suffering enough to actually leave. I felt that way within 15 minutes of sitting through ""Sex Tape"" and it never improved, it just kept getting more agonizingly crappy. It was bad enough that I don't think I can ever look at Cameron Diaz again and certainly will never go to another one of her movies. Jason Segal... that'll take a while as well. The writing was unimaginably boring, like a bad drama trying to be a comedy. Painful. Was there some reason that the best friends' kid had it in for Jason Segal's character, because I never figured that out. Can't imagine what they were thinking. Just awful massive fail.",/review/rw3114795/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2014,TheMarwood,4," Sex iPad
","Putting aside that this film is a shameless Apple shill - even if Sex Tape used fictitious products, this film would still be a lame vehicle for two actors trying to charm and improv their way through a sex comedy that is too afraid to offend and too thin of a film to even be a half hour TV sitcom with commercials. Nothing feels at stake for these two dim bulb characters because they barely register as anything more than actors trying to be hip and funny and the last thing they come across as are a believable couple or even human. Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper tag along on the search as their friends and because the lazy script couldn't even find a good line or something for these two talented people to do, they are wasted in throwaway supporting roles. Jake Kasdan, who is capable of so much more than this, directs with no style or care and the film feels like it turned to vapor before the last act ends. There's nothing wrong with filler comedies that just want to provide a laugh with no lasting impression, but Sex Tape can't even rise to the lowbrow occasion of the most lifeless raunchy comedy.",/review/rw3114795/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2014,jibalis,," They should refund our money and time
","There was promise in the premise of a couple dealing with a too close for comfort situation. Sadly, every single element here is the worst of the worst. From the writing, to the non existent ""comedy"", to the horrible casting choices and the lack of chemistry in many of the different couples here. It's hard to feel any empathy for the old couple, or even believe any of the spouses were really fond of each other, and the unbelievably stupidity of the script dragged everyone to even lower levels. This was one time when one was wishing for negative numbers to be used for ratings here.",/review/rw3114795/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2014,TheSeaLion,1," This is a nothing movie
","""In my experience, the shorter the joke, the more effective. Ten seconds is hilarious, four minutes is embarrassing,""-Hope Chapman. This quote is perfect for describing ""Sex Tape"" starring Cameron Diaz (Annie) and Jason Segel (Jay). Even if every attempted joke didn't go on for five minutes, they were not funny to begin with and there are so many problems, big and small, that this movie has that it is almost impossible to see anything positive that came from this abomination that has been passed off as a movie.",/review/rw3114795/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2014,utgard14,3," Excrement
","Dumb, unfunny comedy with two leads that have little chemistry. Cameron Diaz certainly looks good but her comedic efforts in this can best be summed up as ""trying too hard."" Jason Segel is far worse. In addition to providing ZERO laughs throughout the film, he looks like an obese person who has had gastric bypass surgery. His skin hangs loosely and his wall-eyedness is even more exaggerated than usual. Think Al Roker meets Marty Feldman. Also, the movie is full of gross shots of his ass. I almost lost my lunch a couple of times. The humor in this is what you expect from a movie called Sex Tape. The excessive use of the F word to compensate for actually having funny material is pathetic. It's like it was written by a kid who has just discovered dirty words and is using them to get a reaction from grown-ups. The only moderately amusing part of the movie is Rob Lowe and that's not saying much. One other thing I want to mention is the obscene amount of product placement. Apple either partly financed this movie or got a hell of a lot of free advertising. It's garbage and you should avoid it unless you're really desperate to see a little bit of skin from Cameron Diaz. But be careful -- for every shot of her ass you get, you'll get two of Jason Segel's fudge sandwich.",/review/rw3114795/?ref_=tt_urv

19 July 2014,mesparza95,1," Pointless.
","Why would you even make a sex tape if you're just going to delete it later? Usually a thing like this would be kept as a memento or something. Also only rich white people would buy all their friends ipad 2's. With also very stale jokes already being thrown at us that cannot even get a smirk out of you or me for that matter. If you enjoyed this movie good for you, and your bad sense of humor. Already unbelievable, you'd expect more from four writers including Jason Segel who has read scripts before. I guess this was just for a quick buck (out of our pockets of course)and to not bring anything new or refreshing.",/review/rw3114795/?ref_=tt_urv

17 July 2014,Rama_Andor1416,1," I'll keep this short, sweet, and simple because this movie didn't.
",So the re-team of 2011's Bad Teacher which I did like very much ends up three years later to make a film that is so outdated with a story that no one cares about. But that is the thing we never can go to a comedy to see the plot because the best comedy limit there plot just enough to add clever jokes to keep you in the seat the you paid for. Well guess what this movie fails at every inch of trying to be like the 2010's Date Night with Steve Carell and Tina Fey with them meeting a bunch of colorful characters that you would rather see in a funnier movie. This is one of the worst films of the year because of course it is boring flat and dull but not even that justifies how bad it is. At least at flipping least The Other Woman was kind alive and bright with it being funny because I can see what people like in that movie. But this is just gosh awful with nothing to convince you at least a single point of being funny smart or even enjoyable because the actors don't even give it there comedy all with nothing to do except run this tired plot into the ground that goes no where.,/review/rw3114795/?ref_=tt_urv

23 August 2015,Scarecrow-88,2," Sex Tape
","Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal are wife and husband who decide to spice things up by making a sex recording on his old iPad. The recording gets into The Cloud and others watch it on the various older versions of iPads, and this initiates the married couple with two kids trying to secure all locations where it might exist as to erase them. That's the movie in a nutshell. And it is just awful. I mean, it isn't funny as much as tiresomely unfunny. And this cast goes for broke trying to make the material work. It just doesn't. Diaz looks fantastic and Segal is in the shape of his life when they must be naked or semi-naked. I credit Segal for getting naked a lot, but Diaz wasn't about to be as liberal with the body's freedom from clothes. Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper are a couple that are good friends with Diaz and Segal, having watched the sex recording, quite complimentary of their bodies. Corddry and Kemper even shag in Diaz and Segal's vehicle while they are in Rob Lowe's house trying to find the iPad given to him by Segal. Rob Lowe plays one of those meek weirdoes in a sweater who talks real soft and seems quite timid and shy. You just know the guy is some sort of secretive creep, but he turns out to be just a very wealthy free-spirit with unusual paintings from Disney movies where his face is featured as the main characters involved! Diaz snorts some coke as Lowe shows her tattoos of Easy E, among others on his person. Graphic, sexual language is used throughout (considering the material, that shouldn't be of no surprise), but it rarely is ever anything better than forced and rather desperate for laughs. Diaz brings a hell of a lot of energy as does Segal but they just can't make gold out of straw this go-around. Diaz is quite sexy, also, in the film, but watching her mug with all she's got with dialogue that begs and pleads for your belly-giggles is often painful. The included visit to YouPorn, with Jack Black, trying to council them on why they made the sex recording in the first place, and the blackmail from Corddry's son for moneys so that Segal wouldn't have it posted on a porn site both want to amuse but I think instead only encourage groaning. This is absolutely skippable. Once we get clips of the sex recording (a tame, carefully edited bunch of clips that would probably have about 25 hits on YouPorn), it is so lame, you'd wonder why Corddry and Kemper got so worked up about it. The travails of Segal and Lowe's dog chasing him is probably the film's lowest point (using a book and treadmill to incapacitate the dog is meant to be amusing; epic fail). I just wish I could get that time back to spend it on something meaningful.",/review/rw3114795/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2014,bob-the-movie-man,4," A poor vehicle to show off Diaz's (acting) talents
","Cameron Diaz is someone that must be so, SO depressing for many middle-aged women. Bursting onto the screen like a shimmering vision of hotness in ""The Mask"" when only 21 she then appeared as a highly believable high-school student 4 years later in ""There's Something about Mary"". Now SIXTEEN years after that in ""Sex Tape"" the 42-year old Diaz again plays - in a flashback scene - her character Annie as a semi-naked college student - still with a gravity-defying body that seems to refuse to age.

","In one sense, this movie has to rank as a success. It made me laugh. Out loud. A lot of comedies - even well regarded ones - don't make me laugh out loud. This one did. But ... the problem with this movie is that all (and I mean literally ALL) the laughs are restricted to one series of scenes that are set in Hank's house. Those scenes are funny. But it's just one set of scenes. The rest of the movie is either crude or boring, and it features a truly obnoxious young teen character who becomes a blackmailer. ",/review/rw3114795/?ref_=tt_urv
