5 January 2020,ThomDerd,8," It will keep your eyes on screen!
","Grace is about to marry the youngest member of the very wealthy Le Domas family. But there's something sinister going on with this family... Well, the movie's central idea is not that new but the delivery of the idea, the pace and the performance of Samara Weaving really elevate this film. Entertaining and tense with comical moments that fit the genre, will make you follow almost all the characters in the film. Also kudos to the slow costume transformation of the bride and the juxtaposition of the prior wedding shots with what happens after, as this helps create a sense of relatability with Grace.",/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2020,kosmasp,8," Just a game
","Or is it? Right from the start we do realize there is more to it than just a simple game. So with that overshadowing the next section of the movie (viewer being ahead of our main character/heroine), it is up to the actors and the dialog/script to keep us on our toes and make this entertaining nonetheless.",/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2019,UniqueParticle,9," Refreshingly original
",To me this was one of the best horror experiences have I ever had! Very suspenseful and fun to watch throughout! Samara Weaving is masterful in the type genre and I absolutely love how there's dark comedy in a few parts. It's very important to note this is very gory no it's not a spoiler just a warning for the squeamish type; for the horror fans you're in for a wonderful treat!,/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2019,TreasureHunterGirl,8," Lots of gore and laughs
","Yes, it is a horror. Yes, it is a comedy. Yes, it is a great watch.",/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2020,planktonrules,8," Enjoyable but clearly NOT a film for most viewers....be forewarned!!
","""Ready of Not"" is a very, very violent, bloody and crude film. I am not necessarily criticizing it for this, but you must know this before you decide to watch. It clearly is an adult film...but even one most adults might have trouble watching because of all the gore. Be forewarned...you will see extreme violence, exploding people and more!!! Think twice before you watch!!",/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2020,Leofwine_draca,5," I was expecting more
","READY OR NOT is an interesting film but also a deeply flawed one that's never quite as funny or as entertaining as it tries to be. I liked the whole idea of the sinister rich family in their wonderful 'old dark house' inspired mansion and the idea of the heroine being hunted down, a little like the French flick FRONTIERS. Unfortunately what promises to be a TURKEY SHOOT-style cat and mouse story of human hunting turns into a largely aimless comedy with repetitive set-pieces and a sub-par script substituting bad language for wit. It's a pity, as the direction is solid and the performances are strong, but imagine this cast with proper dialogue to play with! I also found the climax a cop out as I was expecting this kind of over-obvious thing to happen. Not a bad film, just something I was expecting more from.",/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2019,Bertaut,7," An entertaining horror-comedy that takes aim at the decadence and insularity of the 1%

27 November 2019,natcalgary,8," Unique engrossing cult classic
","This movie blew my mind. It is a slasher/gore film with the perfect amount of comedy.
The story line the acting the whole thing just reeks of a cult classic and I will reccommend this highly.",/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2019,alfredocardoso,7," Can't understand the low ratings
","It is a great thriller with a good dose of comedy. It doesn't set out to be taken seriously, it is just a great hour and a half of fun. Just a great watch. Give it a chance; I would love to watch more titles like this one.",/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2021,Slarkshark,7," The Red Wedding
","This was a good bit of fun. Dark comedy with plenty of gore and an explosive ending. Still filled with bonehead decision making, as one would expect with a horror type film.",/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2019,scottliddle76,8," Great fun gem of a movie
",People rating this movie a 1 or 2 are simply just wrong. Your reasons for a low rating like that is just ridiculous. It's a comedy horror and clearly states that and the trailer clearly shows you that. Sooooo why moan about it having comedic moments in the movie? Just plain dumb.,/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2019,muamba_eats_toast,10," So much fun!
","I didn't expect much from this but it just worked perfectly. A great cast, enough of a storyline to work, great action, perfect amount of comedy and one liners thrown into lighten the mood and even a great ending. Most fun I've had at the cinema in months.",/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2020,neil-476,9," Great fun
","When Grace marries into the Le Domas family, whose great wealth is from the sales of games, it's not a huge surprise to find out that a family game features on her wedding night. The game is Hide and Seek, and it turns out that the object is not so much to avoid being found, it's more to avoid being found and killed.",/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2020,Larsii90,9," Great, twisted horror/thriller
","Despite some predictable moments and dumb decitions I enjoyed it. Creepy and fun premise, setting, good cast and characters and great acting. It was twisted, gory and went in new directions several times. It kept me guessing and I would recommend it. Something different! Sadly you can't expect horror flicks to be good anymore, but this surprised me!",/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2019,Fella_shibby,7," Nothing memorable or impactful apart from aunt Helene's hair n her never give up attitude.
","A bride has to spend her wedding night playing a game of hide n seek with her in laws. Unknown to her, the family has a tradition of sacrificing the new member before dawn to please satan or they might lose their life.
Whether she gets killed or whether the mumbo jumbo truly exists is the highlight which gets bogged down by the lack of suspense or tension.
Rightly stated by BA_Harrison that the secret doors, rooms n servant tunnels r not covered properly.
The film does get a bit monotonous. The side characters get killed while our scream queen gets to survive a hell lottuva ordeal.
The maids r hot babes but they dont have much to do. None of the kills r memorable.
Watch out for aunt Helene with her comical hairstyle n a never give up attitude who is always ready with an axe.",/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2019,kluseba,4," Not ready
","Ready or Not tries to be a mixture of a comedy and a horror movie and fails at both. The movie is never atmospheric, intense or scary enough to be a great horror movie. The film is never clever, surprising or vibrant enough to be an entertaining comedy movie. Even by poor b-movie standards, the story of this film is completely ridiculous in a way that it's almost insulting.",/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2019,samtko-04675,8," Silly, very silly, but very good
","This film is smarter than most films of it's nature but it's still silly, goofy, gory fun.
Samara weaving is fantastic as per usual (she always seems to steal the show in her films), it's not hard to have fun here and enjoy it for what it is (many people have tried looking more critically at it and miraculously failed).",/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2019,GT-Lar,6," Very silly story but entertaining 6/10 .
","Wow what a silly story i was shaking my head in disbelief all the way thru .... but gotta say it is an enjoyable romp and i loved the ending but i can see people really hating the whole film , just turn your brain off and enjoy the sillyness .....!!!!!",/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2020,Mike_T-Little_Mtn_Sound_Archive,8," Super fun flick!
","It's got a little bit of everything!
-sex (barely)
-drugs
-Satan
-blood & gore
-ironic soundtrack
-sarcasm (come on...Adam Brody's in it)
-humor as dark as the night is black",/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2019,namob-43673,8," Great funny, and pretty unique movie

19 December 2019,claudio_carvalho,6," The Wedding Game
","Grace (Samara Weaving), who was raised in foster houses, meets Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien), who belongs to a wealthy traditional family, and they soon fall in love with each other. They decide to get married to each other at the Le Domas mansion and during the wedding night Alex tells to Grace that shall play a game to join the family. Grace meets the whole family in an isolated room and draws a card from the deck. When she shows the ""Hide and Seek"" card, the family members ask her to hide while they hunt her down in the mansion in a weird ritual to Satan.",/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,aidanratesmovies,10," Quite an Enjoyable Surprise
","Surprisingly smart, nimble, and by far an absolute blast- Ready or Not truly makes the best of its absurd premise, by not taking itself too seriously and finding a sheer sense of energy and balance between the humor and the chaos ensued. Samara Weaving leads a surprisingly great cast, with a performance that was absolutely perfect for the role involved. All other characters gave quite good performances as well, and to my surprise, none of their acting seemed too forced or taken too far. The script at times can prove to be a bit messy, but it is all in good fun, and by the time it is over, you will almost be impressed with the lengths it covered in such a short runtime. The pacing is quite good, and the cinematography is quite brilliant. For such a small budgeted film, you can't help but be blown away by the amount of quality involved in such a film. It simply shouldn't be and feel as it good as it is, and yet, it is true. Ready or Not is easily one of the best surprises of 2019, and proves that an absurd concept can be quite a good film, if having the right people involved.
My Rating: 9.5/10",/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2019,MamadNobari97,7," HELL YES!
",Haven't enjoy a gory movie like this since The Cabin in the Woods. The last scene was the cherry on the top because I was waiting for THAT scene the whole movie.,/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2019,lasttimeisaw,7," an above-average genre fare that might surprisingly win over many nay-sayers
","""More successfully deployed is the wacky tone that is against the grain of the default somber and grisly timbre, the persecutors are not cynical, morbid sickos but gormless Wasp ne'er-do-wells, who are set out to kill only to save their own skin, thus introduces risible characters like the drug-popping, lethally accident-prone Emilie Le Domas (Scrofano), and her cheekily skeptical, shiftless husband Fitch (Brunn), who can languidly take his time to google ""how to use a crossbow"" amidst the hair-raising hunting game.""",/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2019,jan_lovefool,10," It's supposed to be fun
","If you didn't have fun watching this movie, then you're looking at it the wrong way. It's supposed to be silly. For horror/thriller/B-movie fans, this was a gold mine. The concept was refreshing. If you're not smiling at the end of the movie, then this genre isn't for you.",/review/rw5275580/?ref_=tt_urv
