","Living in a house on a closed-off oval of a street, Otto is not just his neighborhood association's resident crank, he's its unofficial watchdog for everything from vehicle rules to animal control to basically whatever irritates him.",/review/rw8783075/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,andyge,8," Packs an emotional punch
",Good grief there are some really grumpy reviewers out there. This is the perfect vehicle for Tom Hanks and he makes the most of the opportunity. ( I note that he and Rita Wilson are producers ). Yes it is a remake of a classic Swedish movie but this plays out to a much larger audience while retaining the same sentiments. Well written and acted this is great entertainment moving seamlessly from comedy to drama and ultimately packs an emotional punch that makes it memorable and pushes it into one of the best movies of the year . A great reminder of why Tom Hanks has been at the top for so long while providing a break out supporting role for Mariano Trevino who is genuinely both very funny and very moving. Can I also highlight the soundtrack ... especially the Kate Bush single . Highly recommended .,/review/rw8783075/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2023,willandcharlenebrown,5," Only ratings over 5 are those who haven't seen original
","It's a decent remake of an AMAZING original Swedish film. If you are literate and read subtitles, do yourself a favor and watch the original first. You will not be disappointed. I think you'd love it far more than this one. If you watch this one alone then that's fine... just stick with it and live in your happy place",/review/rw8783075/?ref_=tt_urv

",Wow. I was not prepared for that. I thought I was going to see a comedy film about a grumpy man who gets frustrated with his neighbours. I did not expect to be in tears by the end - and not tears of laughter.,/review/rw8783075/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2023,steveinadelaide,8," A thought-provoking look at life, love, and the importance of friendship
","A MAN CALLED OTTO is a heart-warming story about how one unlikely friendship can change someone's life for the better. Otto Anderson (Tom Hanks) is an older, grumpy widower who is very set in his ways. When the pregnant Marisol (Mariana Treviño) and her young family move in over the road from Otto, Otto meets his match with her quick wit and sassiness. Despite the initial friction between them, the pair eventually become friends and Marisol helps to revive Otto's passion for life.",/review/rw8783075/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,richard-1787,10," Greatness made from a thousand small, carefully crafted elements expertly woven together
","The sixty-eight previous reviews on here are either very favorable, or complain that this isn't like the Swedish movie adapted from the same novel. To the latter, smaller group I can only say: Movies are their own works of art, folk. They may be adapted from books or other movies or whatever, but as works of art, they stand or fall on their own terms, not on whether they adapted some other work well. The fact that the poster for this movie is very clearly designed to recall the one for that other movie, *A Man Called Ove*, shows that the creative team here was not afraid of the comparison, and indeed evidently encouraged it.",/review/rw8783075/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,orcinussr,5," Overall disappointing - maybe watch the original instead
","In a nutshell, I'm beginning this film with a bais, I've seen the original Swedish film 'a man called Ove' and it was definitely one of my favorites of that 2015 year - however this is not that, and to be honest, it pales in comparison - sadly so, it's told mostly thru flashbacks that are long and meandering that I almost feel are done to provide a gentle vehicle for the producers son, to enter safely into the realm of major motion picture acting - I'm not a fan of this film, however I can't say how I'd truly feel had I not seen the almost brilliantly written original - that said I can't recommend it but do highly recommend it's counterpart.",/review/rw8783075/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2023,UniqueParticle,10," One of the most satisfying tearjerkers/comedies
","I absolutely loved A Man Called Otto I don't know about the original but this movie is a masterpiece! I'll never understand people that don't appreciate new visions of cinema especially ones that are spectacular like this. Regardless Tom Hanks was electrifying in this and Marc Forster directed this so well every scene was engagingly heartwarming, comedic, somber, and very entertaining! The audience I saw with enjoyed quite a bit I'm not sure why others didn't as much. My review might get mixed vibes but I would like to say I'm painfully lonely even though I'm 30 I have autism I'm not as lucky as most maybe one day it'll be different. Phenomenal film no matter what.",/review/rw8783075/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2023,FeastMode,6," A really nice movie
","I'm usually not a fan of ""nice"" movies, but this one really hit me the right way. It's pretty funny with a good story told cleverly in a nonlinear fashion that continued to keep me curious. Tom Hanks is awesome, as he always is in every role. It's crazy how likeable they make this angry grump.",/review/rw8783075/?ref_=tt_urv

","I went into this movie with little expectations, and came out with this added to one of my favourite films of all time. I felt every emotion during this experience. I couldn't picture anyone else play the character of Otto, Tom hanks absolutely nailed it in this. Along with the female lead, she was hilarious and had the whole cinema laughing at times!",/review/rw8783075/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2023,ferguson-6,6," people do change
","Greetings again from the darkness. Grumpy people are everywhere these days. In fact, two-time Oscar winner and all-around likable guy Tom Hanks (FORREST GUMP, PHILADELPHIA) may be the only one who catches us off-guard when he's grumpy. Here, Hanks plays Otto, the neighborhood curmudgeon who patrols the community daily drenched in full-fledged annoyance over topics like pets, recycling, traffic, and parking. In fact, Otto is annoyed by most people and just about everything they do (and these days, who amongst us isn't).",/review/rw8783075/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2023,imseeg,5," Bland. Unoriginal. Sorry, but it honestly didnt touch me..
","The bad: Tom Hanks is being miscast as a depressed, grumpy old man. It is not his inherent usual Tom Hank's charisma. And even worse he does NOT perform this grumpy character very well. Not terrible, it's still Tom Hanks performing, but It's rather one dimensional and not very credible unfortunately.",/review/rw8783075/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,CinemaSerf,7," A Man Called Otto
","Fans of the BBC sitcom ""One Foot in the Grave"" might recognise something of the ""Victor Meldrew"" in Tom Hanks' portrayal of the eponymous curmudgeon. Formerly head of the community association, he takes it upon himself each morning to do his ""rounds"" - checking the gates are closed, the permits are displayed, the recycling is correct - all pretty anal, really. A combination of circumstances are about to rock his rather pedestrian world, though. He is laid off after thirty-odd years at work, a deed which renders him pretty rudderless; and he gets new neighbours - ""Marisol"" (Mariana Treviño), husband ""Tommy"" (Manuel Garcia-Ruffo) and their two daughters. Now their arrival causes him no end of irritation (and, if truth be told - for me too!). The family are pretty hapless and soon ""Otto"" finds himself helping them out and gradually, her forceful and annoying character starts to morph into something more accommodating and he begins to feel just a tad useful. Now it ought to be said that most of this story evolves against a backdrop of attempts by the older man to kill himself. There is humour to be had here, as well a rather nuanced message illustrating the effects of loneliness and a general resignation that the fruitful section of his life is finished. Gradually using ""Marisol"" and a few other neighbours as conduits, we learn of the tragedies that have led him to his current predicament, and to a position where there might just be a new light at the end of his tunnel. From a character perspective, I preferred the ""Otto"" at the start of the film. A rather bitter and amusingly sarcastic figure, but as the plot develops we lose that sharpness, the story becomes a little too cluttered and I found the initial poignancy falls away as a rather sentimental degree of melodrama edges into it all. Still, Hanks offers a strong performance and after her distinctly annoying start I found myself increasingly engaged with the whole family across the road who might just offer ""Otto"" some validation and/or salvation. It's also a remarkable understatedly inclusive film. This community has all sorts of colours, shapes and sizes - and ""Otto"" for all his faults, has no truck with discrimination. This inclusiveness is delivered to us quietly as if it is all no big deal. A more productive and subtle method than many offering the screamingly obvious box-ticking characterisations. This is a good film, not a great one, and I am not sure it needs to be seen in a cinema - but I would certainly suggest you do get round to watching it.",/review/rw8783075/?ref_=tt_urv

","Yesterday, the last day of 2022, a Saturday my wife and I decided to go to the movies to spend an afternoon out together. So I pulled up the local movie theatre to see what was playing and this was showing (English version) and the other movie with the blue aliens (we were not up for watching a 3 hour extravaganza). Never heard of this movie so looked up the preview on IMDB and thought we'd enjoy it. Noticed it hasn't come out in the States yet, we're south of the border.",/review/rw8783075/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2023,valyriansteel-68349,10," A honest soulful drama that we missed lately!!
","Needless to say how good an actor Tom Hanks is. He is the heart and soul of this movie. It took us back to the days of Forrest Gump reminding us of true American spirit. The message to today's audience is to stay connected with people around you. To spread love, to be helpful to each other, to share both happiness and sorrow. The thing the stood out particularly to me was the relationship of Otto with his neighbors. It all started off grumpy but deep inside we get to see a wonderful human being. His chemistry with the Mexican neighbor is so refreshing that it brings a purpose to his otherwise boring life. This is what the modern day neighbors including me should learn. To be approachable, to be friendly, to try help each other out. After all life is short, let's keep our egos aside. Kudos to the makers and the great actors in this wonderful piece of work.",/review/rw8783075/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,subxerogravity,7," Not the worse way to end 2022
","The last movie I will see in theaters in 2022, has Tom Hanks playing a grieving widow who sees no reason to live but then a group of people force a reason onto him. Slightly remember seeing the Swedish movie and the only thing this movie really has is Tom Hanks who gives a decent if not his best performance, but a performance good enough to make the movie watchable and that's all it is, watchable. Its not going to change your life or anything but if you can connect with Otto or any of the ensemble cast than you won't go away hating this mediocre movie. It is funny and charming but there are definitely better Tom Hanks pictures to be watched.",/review/rw8783075/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2023,HabibieHakim123,8," A Man Called Otto Is A Very Nice Touching Little Film
","8.5/10
It is the first movie that i watch in 2023 in the theaters but not the first original 2023 movie that i watch in the theaters, A Man Called Otto starring Tom Hanks is an adaptation from both the novel and the swedish film which i never read and watch so i can't really compare it to those two, and as the blind one i really really do think A Man Called Otto is a very nice touching little film that while it needs to be growing for me at first, it keeps working and working even more and i love it at the end, very very strongly perform by the great Tom Hanks and the rest of the supporting cast performance are just delightful and amazing, it's a 2 hours of an enjoyable, funny, and entertaining film with a very serious theme that when it touch on the serious theme it really hit me to the heart, A Man Called Otto flawed at a some places but overall i still have quite a good time with A Man Called Otto in the theaters and as a movie itself like i mention earlier, a very nice touching little film that fills with a great story, amazing performance by all the cast with their likable convincing good characters, also great music and good score, i love it and i highly recommended.",/review/rw8783075/?ref_=tt_urv
