15 June 2005,BrandtSponseller,10," Wow!
","I know that title isn't very descriptive, but all I could say for awhile after watching I Am Sam was, ""Wow!"" Although that's a positive endorsement of the film--it's rare that a film has me basically speechless afterward (I usually suffer from logorrhea, which sounds close enough to diarrhea that you could call it (verbal) flatulence instead if you like)--it turned out to be quite a problem, because we went to dinner right afterward and I had to give a lecture. I believe I was served some kind of raw beef, and I have an exorbitant dry cleaning bill from the tomatoes and rotten eggs.",/review/rw0792912/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2002,grahamsj3,9," Powerful film!
","I haven't been a fan of Sean Penn's since Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Since that time, nearly all his films have left me flat. In fact, I nearly didn't watch this film since he was in it. What a loss it would have been if I'd missed it! I won't go into the story line since that's been reviewed a lot by others. The story is sort of a cliché'd one and has been done before, though not as well. The story isn't this film's strength anyway - it's the acting. Rarely have I seen a film with this much powerful acting. Penn's performance as Sam is brilliant! He must have studied autistic/mentally challenged people to pull this performance off. I also want to mention how good Michele Pfeiffer was in this. Her character starts out as a hard-hearted witch and ends up being very human, thanks to her exposure to Sam. The change in her is gradual, subtle and fun to watch. Sams friends, very well played by Brad Silverman, Joseph Rosenberg, Stanley DeSantis and Doug Hutchinson are very important support characters. Laura Dern gives a stellar performance as Randy. Dakota Fanning as Lucy very nearly steals the show. This little actress has quite a career ahead of her, I hope! This film is delicately balanced, and has a good bit of humor interspersed with parts that will have even the most insensitive of you reaching for a tissue. The film has a sort of a sappy (and somewhat surprising) outcome, but by this time any other ending would have been pretty much unacceptable to most people. This movie blew me away and I gave it a 9.",/review/rw0792912/?ref_=tt_urv

1 October 2004,mdm-11,8," Mentally challenged single dad fights to care for daughter
","Sean Penn as a devoted father (Sam) who despite mental challenges, fights for the right to raise his child is convincing in a complete departure from his usual ""bad guy"" characters. Michelle Pfeiffer plays his reluctant ""pro bono"" elite lawyer, who eventually puts 110% into this case.",/review/rw0792912/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2005,vchimpanzee,," Very well done, especially Penn and Fanning
","In 'Rain Man', Dustin Hoffman gave the best portrayal I have ever seen of a mentally disturbed person, but Sean Penn came very close here. He was quite convincing but somewhat funnier. With Hoffman, I never quite knew when he was supposed to be funny, but with Penn there were many funny moments that I felt okay about laughing at. And I just had to like the character.",/review/rw0792912/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2002,Amy723,," Great film, but hard to watch at times
","I Am Sam is a great movie that deals with marginalized people in our society and how they're treated. It's a very realistic portrayal. I watched it with my 13 year old daughter and it alternately made us cry, got us angry and caused us to laugh uncontrollably.",/review/rw0792912/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," One of my favourite movie
","This film goes to show you that often critics lose their humanity and writhe in puddles of their own egotistical nonsense. This is a great film with a brilliant performance by Sean Penn (who broke the rules and went full retard). I wouldn't put it up there with Rain Man, but this is still a great film. Michelle Pfeiffer wishes every film she was in was like this, and Dakota Fanning is cute enough to get away with playing the same role she played in every film she did as a child: the little girl who's too smart for her own good.",/review/rw0792912/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have to confess off the top that I am not and never have been a particular fan of Sean Penn. I have no specific criticism to make of him; as an actor he simply doesn't appeal to me. Because of that bias I approached this movie with low expectations. The story of a mentally handicapped man fighting for custody of his seven year old daughter sounded intriguing, but it starred Penn. But what a pleasant surprise this movie turned out to be!",/review/rw0792912/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2010,Jerique,9," Heart Warming Tale About a Loving Father
","In an eye opening performance, Sean Penn plays mentally challenged Sam. It was the 2001 Academy Awards when I began to doubt the Oscars because Sean Penn was robbed of the Best Actor category. I really believed at the time, that Sean Penn was mentally challenged. He was way more deserving of the award than Denzel.",/review/rw0792912/?ref_=tt_urv

However leading up to her seventh birthday Sam gets in trouble with the police over a simple mistake and his situation is brought to the attention of the authorities who remove Lucy from his care.

28 June 2005,Surecure,5," A film both full and empty at the same time
","I Am Sam is one of those films that you will love for so many reasons and find infuriating at the same time. It is by far one of the best examples of acting talent across the board and evokes such levels of emotion that one is drawn deeply into the story. But, it makes a statement so one-sided and irresponsible that you cannot help but feel like you have just eaten a huge meal of empty calories by the time it is done.",/review/rw0792912/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I saw in television announcing about the story of ''I Am Sam'', I didn't think twice and got the DVD of this movie to watch. First of all, Sean Penn's performance is awesome! He really look a mentally challenged person in all his acts and ways to move and talk!

18 August 2006,moonspinner55,6," Worthy sentiment, but the arty presentation is illogical and shallow...
","Sean Penn plays a mentally challenged man whose close relationship with his smart 7-year old daughter is threatened by the local legalese after an encounter with a prostitute (!) and is pursued in the courts. ""I Am Sam"" exists in an almost alternate reality: nobody talks the way normal people speak, and many of the situations are manipulated to be effective, yet bear no resemblance to real life. Penn's performance is occasionally agonizing, but he is also extremely sensitive, intentionally funny and sad; Dakota Fanning is likably wise-beyond-her-years as his little girl. All the performances are commendable, but the script is a tangled mass of ideas that either don't work or don't build momentum (the hooker episode is just a pretense to get us into court, and it's execrably staged). The arty presentation (with herky-jerky cinematography and colors that are either cartoon bright or steely blue) is another liability, but the finale is moving and Penn's energy nearly makes it all worthwhile. **1/2 from ****",/review/rw0792912/?ref_=tt_urv

","I AM SAM (2001) ***1/2 Sean Penn, Michelle Pfeiffer, Dakota Fanning, Dianne Wiest, Richard Schiff, Loretta Devine, Mary Steenburgen, Laura Dern, Doug Hutchison, Stanley De Santis, Brad Silverman, Will Wallace.  Penn gives an extraordinary performance as a mentally challenged single parent to his 7 year old daughter (sweet and smartly played by newcomer Fanning) and enlists Type A attorney Pfeiffer (excellent as well)  to help him keep her from being taken away from him.  Tearjerker of the top order even if it means peppering soundtrack with cover tunes of Beatles' songs (a thread linked to Penn's Sam's love for The Fab Four) which underscore the truth to this film : all you need is love.  One of the year's best. (Dir: Jessie Nelson)",/review/rw0792912/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2006,film-critic,9," Do we get balloons?
","I did cry during this film. There, I got it out there in the open so that it wouldn't hold me back as I talked about how great of a cinematic journey I Am Sam was. I remember when this film was released and how disgusted I was to hear that Sean Penn was taking the role of a mentally challenged individual because I am under the utter beliefs that if you want realism in your film, just hire someone who faces it daily. I didn't see the point of getting Sean Penn to over dramatize it. I am here to say that I was wrong. For once, I think Sean Penn was the perfect choice for this film. Yet, it wasn't just Penn that made this film worth more than one viewing. I believe that director Jessie Nelson realized that she had a cliché Hollywood story on her hands, in fact just another retelling of Kramer vs. Kramer (which is referenced throughout the film), and needed to do something to set it apart from the rest. Her answer, Beatles songs, imaginative cinematography, and gathering the best of the best to tackle her main characters. While Michelle Pfeiffer seemed to be an odd fit, the rest fell into place beautifully. Let me say this now, Dakota Fanning will win Oscars (more than one) during her film career. Needless to say, this was a much better film that initially represented. I Am Sam is one of those movies that we assume will be just like every other Hollywood outing, but until you open the box, put the DVD into your player, and experience the music, the visuals, as well as the phenomenal acting; you will never quite understand why I Am Sam carried above the Hollywood standard.",/review/rw0792912/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2002,mattymatt4ever,9," VERY POWERFUL FILM!!!
","""I Am Sam"" has its flaws.  This is not a perfect film.  This is not a masterpiece.  Then why am I ranking it so highly?  Because of the way it made me feel.  It took me on an emotional rollercoaster and allowed me to ponder a lot of questions I've taken for granted in the past.  This movie proves the saying, ""People will always forget what you say, but they'll never forget the way you make them feel.""  This movie has its flaws and I'll get to them later, but I can only name them because the movie is still fresh in my mind.  I'll probably forget them later.  But what I will never forget is the way this movie made me feel.  I'm not a law expert, so I wouldn't know if a mentally challenged man like Sam Dawson would legally be able to take custody of his daughter.  But the law is not the issue.  The issue is, Does Sam DESERVE to take custody of Lucy?  And I watched those touching scenes between Sam and Lucy, I couldn't help but feel, ""Yes!""  In the courtroom scene where Sam cries out the line, ""Why isn't Lucy coming home with me?"" I couldn't provoke myself from bursting into tears. ",/review/rw0792912/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2002,Rod-88,," OVERALL A TOUCHING FILM WITH FLAWS
","This movie has flaws, but this movie touched me.  Maybe its because I'm a father of a six year-old girl, but I was moved by the love between father and daughter, Sam and Lucy.  Sean Penn plays Sam, a mentally challenged man that instantly becomes a single parent, when the mother immediately abandons them when they leave the hospital.  He some how raises her with help from a neighbor, played by Diane Wiest.  On her eighth birthday, child protective services take her away from Sam.  It has become apparent that Lucy surpassed her father in intelligence, and she is struggling to cope with classmates and friends making fun of Sam.  Can Sam adequately care for Lucy?  The whole time I was watching, the answer was, no.  This is where the movie fails. It did not convince me that this mentally challenged man that could not even eat at a Kip's Big Boy without freaking out because they did not have French pancakes, could raise this child by himself.",/review/rw0792912/?ref_=tt_urv
