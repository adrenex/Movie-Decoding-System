","This show is so unrealistic it's not even funny. Doctors constantly being unprofessional, forcing their beliefs onto patients. I can't watch this show anymore. The writers all need to be fired.",/review/rw3631867/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2018,aaronredis,4," Chicago Med: A series that I once loved, but now love to hate. No . . . maybe it's just hate.
","I once loved Chicago Med. It's first season was actually pretty good. (The only episode I really disliked from the show's first season was #1.10 ""Clarity."" This was due to the fact that one of the storylines were eerily similar to one from Code Black, which was produced and aired long before said Chicago Med episode had, but . . . I digress.) What attracted me to this show was its decent storylines that more than made up for moments of less-than good acting. I would even argue that the series' second season was even stronger, with episodes like ""Graveyard Shift,"" ""Cold Front,"" and ""Love Hurts."" Now that the third season is far into is its run, I only grow more and more annoyed and bothered with this show. Why? I have a few reasons. Allow me to explain.",/review/rw3631867/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2022,jbrbsmom,2," If you have any background in medicine you will turn this right off
","This show started out well in the first season, but deteriorated to absolutely unwatchable by the third season. The medical facts are so dubiously and patently ridiculously presented that I could NOT get past it. And I am not a "" medical snob"". I just cannot stand when the reality of a supposedly real show is so far off base as to be so completely off base that it ruins any hope of an actual plot line .",/review/rw3631867/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2020,nkcici,1," One expression and one storyline
","So glad to see other reviews echoing my feelings about Chicago Med. For long I thought I was alone in my disappointment. Started watching this series because it is a part of the trilogy of the Chicago series and because I really like PD. PD is an interesting and truly entertaining cop-show. Chicago Fire is like its' nerdy uncle; filled with Dad jokes and plots that are signaled a mile ahead. Saves so silly I blush when I watch it... but at the same time absolutely entertaining! I get that it is well nigh impossible to create believable fire rescues in a TV series so I'd rather blush and watch than stop altogether. I suspend my disbelief.
Chicago Med though. OMG. Unprofessional doctors, always in a huff over a parent (I am going to report this parent to the DHSS!), a relative, a loved one or whatever, the doctors are ready to throw their scorn and belittlement over the population of Chicago. High standards indeed. And from the beginning Will Halstead has been the petulant overlord of that ""I am damned if I am going to learn from any one of my mistakes! Never!""- attitude. How many times now has he gone against everyone and done something utterly outrageous? The actor is unknown to me so I don't know how chosen his facial expressions for the Halstead figure are, but I am getting so triggered by the petulant ""mouth half open"" by this time in the series I can't continue watching it. That expression is like some helpful-Chucky or a Baby Born doll waiting someone to stick a pretend milkbottle into the half open mouth. How did they create Jay's brother as this unlearning asinine man who always meets his co-workers with a mumpish face?
And then there's Choi, Natalie, April and April's stupid brother....everyone of them more knowledgeable than their colleagues when the whim takes them. Everyone of them ready to throw loyalty to profession, colleagues, patients and workplace in the wind so that they might - yet again - be allowed to do the stupidest option available. These aren't storylines. This is just cashing in on a trilogy with easy peasy money and no proper respect for the viewer.",/review/rw3631867/?ref_=tt_urv

30 April 2020,socrfan-60834,5," I did like the show
","It started out good. And no medical drama is going to be completely realistic. My gripe is the show has become less about medicine and more about who is mad at who, who is arguing with who and who is breaking up with who.",/review/rw3631867/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2021,msmankamal,1," Can't handle more of the egoistic portrayals
","Everyone in this show feels they know more than the other person. Except from Dr Charles . Nurses behaving and scolding doctors , questioning authority every minute . Doctors judging patients , their caretakers as if they are subhumans. Everyone in the show has done things that should get them fired and yet they are still with a job is beyond me .. took it off my dvr list two weeks ago . Never coming back .

30 April 2021,JJ99ABC,1," Outstanding Achievement in Writing Incompetence
","Never in the history of television, has a medical drama depicted a bigger collection of emotionally unstable, narcissistic, and unlikable characters. I give credit to the writing staff of this show who have likely created perfect projections of themselves. It is truly a remarkable achievement. Besides the atrocious medicine and uniformly unlikable characters, the virtue signaling is enough to illuminate all 8 runways at O'Hare during a blackout on a moonless night. If your idea of entertainment is to be lectured and hectored by writers who know they are smarter and more enlightened than their audience, this is the TV show for you. Just about every episode features self-righteous moralizing and hackneyed ""lessons"" for the ignorant masses watching at home.",/review/rw3631867/?ref_=tt_urv

19 March 2021,williamsonandcompany,4," How not to run a hospital
","Seems all shows today have to include sex in the work place all the time. In reality it rare that that happens, especially in hospitals. Hospitals, Police, Fire obey orders and do a professional job on a daily basis. Shows like this and more important writers like this really paint a mythical world to audiences on how you do what you want, if you think it's best, you don't always have to obey your superiors, sex is common in the work place. It's BS! If these doctors were real they would be fired in less than a month for being unprofessional towards each other and their patients. If a patient comes in and refuses treatment and wants to die, they can, and doctors don't break laws to prevent that, it's the choice of the patient. Also this much drama and serious medical issues are presented to hospitals on small percentage. According to this hospital it's war everyday. Bring back MASH, that's the best medical show of all time.",/review/rw3631867/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2018,sullivak-1,3," ER but bad
","I am surprised to see the positive reviews here. This is an e terribly phony depiction of an emergency department and hospital. I have worked in the medical industry for over a decade, but am usually very forgiving of the medicine depicted in fiction. However, this one was so unrealistic that I could not reasonably ""suspend disbelief"". ",/review/rw3631867/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2021,zoesamhap,2," Seriously?
","They're all criminals, endlessly breaking the law, HIPAA, assisted suicide, altering labs.... it never ends. When they aren't all sleeping with everyone, they continuously show blatant disregard for patient rights, patient choices, confidentiality, their peers.... it's vomit inducing. I know it's a show, but as a healthcare worker this is repulsive. No consequences ever, no self reflection, no humility. How many people do these doctors and nurses have to kill before losing their licenses. Taking care of patients is endless hard choices, it's following the rules even when you don't want to, it's sometimes going against instincts because it's what the patient decides. Not these smug, holier than thou, attitudes.",/review/rw3631867/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2019,staubachster,1," This show is unrealistic and terrible.
","Totally unbelievable, unrealistic medical situations, plots, and characters. Rife with stereotypes. Totally poorly written with lame, inauthentic dialogue and character non-development. Mostly terrible acting. Even the decent actors can't save it because the script is so ridiculous. Unbelievably bad. It defies logic that it hasn't been cancelled. Is it hanging on because it's one of the Chicago trio? Chicago Fire and PD would be better off as a duo.",/review/rw3631867/?ref_=tt_urv

3 October 2019,mmmaaa7890,1," It goes downhill really quickly
","I used to like this very much. However I hate how they treated Ava. She is a strong character and apparently the writers does not know how to write a strong and reasonable character, so she suddenly became a crazy women. The writers tried to justified by saying she has emotional issues. Like since when? They totally screwed this character and I suspected the actress probably do not like this development either.",/review/rw3631867/?ref_=tt_urv

","When we first started watching this show, it was enjoyable... a typical medical drama, the kind we're both attracted to. But, as the seasons go on, it's just getting worse and worse. The medical staff are portrayed as the most unprofessional people ever. The patients' desires? Who cares, we do what we want. Ethics? Not at this hospital. Standard medical practices? Those are so last week - let's do this unknown procedure we read about on the internet! I real life, that ED would be completely restaffed.",/review/rw3631867/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2016,IrishFrog,5," Meh
","""Meh"" is what defines this show to me. It isn't particularly good nor particularly bad, it's not even memorable, to be honest. The characters were boring at best and hateful at worst, the main story lines are just average and I couldn't be bothered about them, the ""subplots"" (that's what I'm calling the stories that are limited to one episode) were sometimes interesting, but their development was eventually flawed and not at all spectacular... But it's not remarkably bad either, it's just... plain, flat, dull. ",/review/rw3631867/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2018,pizzygod,," Completely unrealistic!
","I have never taken the time to write a review, but this show is horrible. Last week I had to shut it off do to the Dr going out to the lobby to berate a man for not vaccinating his son (who wasn't even the patient) I am an ER nurse a Dr doesn't have time to see his own patients let alone yell at a family member in the waiting room. What really frustrates me if the patient doesn't want treatment and yet they continue to try to treat or lir about treatment! This does not happen! If you do not want treatment we are very happy to hand you AMA papers! ERs do not have time for these things! Why oh tell me why does the patient never leave the ER? They should be in the ICU but for some reason they are getting ECMO in the ER! This is not reality!

9 June 2022,flamingonut-1,4," Been watching from the start,
","And I honestly don't know why I continue to watch. The acting is perhaps the worst I have ever seen in a show. From day 1. How does it never improve? I don't get how it has survived 7 seasons. And any doctor they had cast that had a foreign accent couldn't act themselves out of a paper bag. Dr. Charles might be the only saving grace. I'm only finishing up the last season on demand bevause there's nothing else on. I doubt I'll watch next season, it's just too hard...",/review/rw3631867/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2017,tlue-13809,1," Bad acting and even worst story lines
","I think the story lines set the stage for such terrible acting. I haven't seen such terrible acting since the Blairwitch project. The story lines are the worst I've ever seen in a TV show in ages (I'm 35 yrs old) thank God for DVR and the delete button. How are the writers allowed to come up with such story lines, it should be an abomination to medicine and television. I want to give the show a chance, but with no excitement, predictable story lines(replace the writers pronto), bad, just terrible/unrealistic approach to medicine (plz fire the medical consultant), poor acting by most of the cast (understands that it comes with experience but......), just a waste of a TV time and my DVR's space. There's no fixing at this point, just replace.",/review/rw3631867/?ref_=tt_urv
