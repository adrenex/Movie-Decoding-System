14 June 2021,Instant_Palmer,9," Spike Lee's Engaging A-Team Heist-Film Scores
","'Inside Man' engages the viewer from the opening scene through the credits. One of the better Heist films one can watch, with an all-star cast of highly-accomplished actors delivering the goods. Recommended viewing!",/review/rw6257065/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2010,Hitchcoc,7," Just a Tad Smug!
","This is a decent but not particularly memorable movie. I thought that Denzel Washington was pretty good, but he seems to have settled into a type. Confident and unyielding and always right (Coach Boone from Remember the Titans). This is fine and I enjoy watching him. This movie is about a bank robbery where the perpetrators are after more than money. It has to do with a righteous cause, but what happens is that the possibility of pulling it off and getting what they want is on such fragile ground that you need to ask the question, ""Isn't there an easier way?"" Anyway, the scenes in the bank are quite good but we really need to extend our disbelief at times. I've always wondered about that ""get me a plane and a million dollars"" business anyway. Well, there's a lot more to it than that. See this and enjoy the characters, but in the long run, it's pretty far fetched.",/review/rw6257065/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2014,SnoopyStyle,6," Spike Lee puts together A-list cast
","Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) talks about a perfect bank robbery from what looks like a prison cell. Police detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington), still in the dog house for something, is given the bank robbery. Detective Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is his partner. There are hostages. The bank president Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) has something important in a safe deposit box. He brings in fixer Madeleine White (Jodie Foster). Captain John Darius (Willem Dafoe) is the uniform cop in charge of the crime scene. The robbers seem more interested in the storage room than the bank vault or the deposit boxes.",/review/rw6257065/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2006,krigler,8," an entertaining heist flick
","Note: I stay away from describing the plot in any detail because it would be very hard to do so without spoiling elements of it. ""Inside Man"" starts out as a no holds barred, high octane action-thriller, and by its midpoint fully transforms into a breezy, tongue-in-cheek heist movie, reminiscent of The Sting. I felt it to be a little over-plotted, but that comes with the genre - the expected twists and turns are all here, thankfully mostly in non-expected ways. Contrivances abound, and we don't really learn the background of the heist (ie. how the robbers learned about their target) but the story and the overall atmosphere more than make up for this. The meticulously designed plot also compensates for the lack of real 3D characterization - save for Denzel Washington's ambitious policeman hero, who at least achieves a level of humanity throughout the story. The character interaction between him and his sidekick (Chiwetel Ejiofor of ""Serenity"" fame) and the frustrated captain played by Willem Defoe is great with some sparkling dialog. Clive Owen is okay, most of the time convincing as the criminal mastermind, although he spends most of the film wearing a mask. I'd say this film is harmless fun, not your usual Spike Lee fare, which goes to prove his versatility. There is a hint in the back-story at some heavy issues of the past, but it's nothing more than a macguffin that only achieves some slight significance in the resolution of the movie. There is a neat structural trickery in the use of flash-forward scenes, hinting toward the aftermath of the heist without giving away the real ending. It's used sparingly and cleverly. I can highly recommend this movie, it is never boring for a moment, what's more, I was enjoying it so much that as events were progressing toward the climax, I was wishing it would go on. And that's very rare for me in the movies nowadays.",/review/rw6257065/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2019,deloudelouvain,8," My kind of movie in this genre.
","In the crime/mystery genre Inside Man is just a bit better than a normal good movie. It's not excellent though, for that the heist is just too far fetched and perfect. Everybody likes to watch the perfect heist but in this case it's a bit exaggerated. But other than that small detail the rest of the movie is suspenseful, or at least it keeps you attentive as you keep wondering what will happen. For that there was the excellent interaction between Denzel Washington and Clive Owen. Both did a great job with their characters. The whole cast was perfect for this story. Spike Lee made another entertaining movie, one that I will watch again in a few years.",/review/rw6257065/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2006,PatrickRijnders,8," With Inside Man, Spike Lee has crafted a very original and exciting thriller.
","Spike Lee is one of the most consistent directors out there. Save for some more uneven pictures like She Hate Me and Girl 6, Lee's body of work is just plain impressive. And while Inside Man is not up there with Do The Right Thing, Clockers and 25th Hour, it is definitely an entertaining and intelligent thriller that does things a little differently than most cookie cutter thrillers you see in theaters nowadays.",/review/rw6257065/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2006,bob the moo,," By not being a straight genre film it manages to strengthen and weaken itself at the same time
","An ordinary day in a major bank, a man dressed as a painter walks in and points torches at the CCTV cameras. Seconds later more people dressed as painters burst in and announce their intentions to all inside. As the hostages are professionally moved into a group and made to dress in the same suits as the robbers, the alarm is raised by a passing cop. For Detective Frazier this is just what he needs to help take his mind off accusations of corruption and girlfriend stress. With a by-the-book hostage situation in front of him things look good but internal and external pressures soon convince him that things are not as straightforward as he first thought.",/review/rw6257065/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2006,El Gato-4,8," Intelligent thrills
","A pleasure from start to finish. An older Denzel Washington has begun to emerge, and his performance here suggests he has many good years left. Clive Owen is terrific as the mastermind. He, and the plot, keeps you guessing. And while there are plenty of clues, they are so well incorporated that very few viewers will see how this one comes together in the end.",/review/rw6257065/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2006,ma-cortes,7," Caper film with a very exciting storyline and surprising ending
","A carefully and neatly perfect crime about a bank robbery goes awry when a band (leader of the gang is Clive Owen)abducts and takes hostages to people of building interior. A Police Inspector(Denzel Washington)must save at whatever cost the hostages bank what's suddenly under siege and itself surrounded of heavily super-armed polices .The robbers have sworn kill if they attack.Psychosis and paranoia abound between the prisoners from all sides and they can see no way out and someone making desperate tryings to flee.Clive Owen as the mastermind,executes an intelligent scheme is both exciting and thrilling although with a twisted finale.",/review/rw6257065/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2016,Leofwine_draca,5," Far too clever for its own good
","INSIDE MAN is one of those clever-clever thrillers in which things aren't as they seem, people aren't who they make out to be and everything's layered in cloying, murky conspiracy that leaves you unsure of just what, exactly, is going on. At its heart it's a simple tale of a bank robbery but, as in DOG DAY AFTERNOON, things are far from simple. The villains' motives are never revealed and it leaves you wondering who the real villains are after all.",/review/rw6257065/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2006,theshadow908,7," A good bank robbery film.
","Inside Man tells the story of a man named Dalton Russel, who leads a daring bank robbery that turns into a hostage situation. Now he's dealing with disgraced hostage negotiator Keith Frazier, who is attempting to get to the bottom of things. When the shady CEO of the bank and a woman he's hired to help him protect certain interests arrive, he begins to discover that there's more to this bank robbery than it would seem. This is the only Spike Lee movie I've ever seen, but trust me, I'll see more, since this was a very intriguing film.",/review/rw6257065/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2006,shadowycat,9," High time the academy gives Spike Lee some respect!
","Whether I was into the subject or not, there's always a filmmaker at work in a Spike Lee film... he's one moviemaker who never loses sight of being a filmmaker first and foremost, and he's absolutely outdone himself with INSIDE MAN, a taut thriller which avoids the colloquialism that alienated mainstream audiences from some of his earlier work.",/review/rw6257065/?ref_=tt_urv

","Clive Owen is in the middle of a perfect bank robbery on Wall Street.

He calls fixer Jodie Foster, and she calls in a lot of favors for a private talk with Owen.",/review/rw6257065/?ref_=tt_urv

23 July 2006,The_Void,7," Would have been better if it wasn't so 'clever'...
","It's all too obvious that Inside Man is meant to be a lot more clever than it actually is; director Spike Lee peppers his film with a light sprinkling of comments on race and society, but not many of them hold any weight and by the time the film ends, it's difficult to work out just what Lee is actually trying to say. Films that try to be intelligent and fail usually receive low ratings from me, but this one manages to claw some points back because it is entertaining, and the central bank robbery plot line is intricately handled with care and panache. It's a shame that Lee decided to try and make more of this than was necessary. I realise that a great deal of undemanding bank robbery films have already been made; but this one could have been one of the best if the director had stuck to the strongpoints. The plot has two sides to it as we follow a bank robbery from inside the bank and out. Dalton is a smart bank robber who figures out a way to both rob a bank and bamboozle the police at the same time. Denzel Washington is the cop on the case, while the plot is given a third dimension from a scheming power broker.",/review/rw6257065/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2006,Rick-34,8," some clever idea and great cast
","It's curious to see Spike Lee do a straight caper movie. The movie is absent Lee's usual politics, though there are occasional glimpses of his sensibilities. At one point a Sikh has his turban taken away and complains at ends how Sikhs are not Arabs and he's tired of getting harassed all the time.",/review/rw6257065/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2006,tedg,," Inside Out
","I want to like Spike, I really do. He has a natural cinematic imagination, something you can see from the very beginning. And he is flamboyant with the camera which I appreciate when the confidence is rewarded.",/review/rw6257065/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2007,cherold,7," Terrific movie for the first two thirds, then ... (spoiler at bottom)
","For most of its length, Inside Man looks to be a great crime movie. The movie is efficient and stylish. Even the smallest characters are given real personalities and the movie has a wonderful sense of New York attitude. Denzel gives a thoughtful performance and Plummer is excellent. The script is smart.",/review/rw6257065/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2006,Robert_duder,5," Sorry folks...my first big Collassal disappointment of 2006
","I thought The Inside Man was a sure fire enjoyable film. How could they miss?? Great, strong leading cast, seemingly flawless action/heist film with some good twists and maybe a mystery to boot. I was psyched to see it, one of my first big anticipations of this year and unfortunately it let me down. I seem to be one of the few as it garnishes rave reviews from IMDb viewers and continues to rake in the money. What can I say?? I found Spike Lee's latest attempt at an intellectual action film campy, poorly delivered and put together, and completely utterly confusing. I'm still not sure the entire basis of the story except pieces here and there. I have not seen a lot of Spike Lee ""joints"" but the few I have seen his style appears to be a non-conformist, mish-mashed, play on regular chronological order ex: Son of Sam, 25th Hour. Both of which I felt a little confused during. Perhaps my ""intellectuality"" I don't know?? ",/review/rw6257065/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2006,claudio_carvalho,6," The Deception of the Year
","It is amazing how a cast with names such as Jodie Foster, Denzel Washington and Clive Owen, directed by the great Spike Lee and with a high-budget can ruin due to an awful flawed screenplay. I wasted my money buying this DVD with a great expectation of a terrific movie, but I found it terrible and boring actually. I would like to leave just one question: Why Mr. Arthur Case, magnificently played by Christopher Plummer, kept such evidences that could destroy his successful life for almost sixty years in a safe? The whole story spins around this ridiculous situation. If you want to see a film of heist, prefer to watch again ""Dog Day Afternoon"" or even ""Heist"", but do not spend your time or money with ""Inside Man"". My vote is six.",/review/rw6257065/?ref_=tt_urv

4 December 2006,ccthemovieman-1,8," Great Acting Highlights This Heist Flick
","Here's another heist-with a negotiator story but done with a different angle and with a few twists. Among the ""twists"" are (1) a bank president who hires someone to try to get something NOT robbed out of his band during the heist, evidence that could destroy his status and career, and (2) the crooks all get away with the mastermind of group hiding in the bank for a week before slipping away in broad daylight. That last part leads me to ask a few questions about that could possibly happen, specifically how get could get out of the vault where he was hidden without all kinds of alarms going off, etc.",/review/rw6257065/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2007,billion_mucks,6," Stalemate
","Although it sets off pretty well, with Clive Owen talking straight to the camera saying he has the perfect plan to rob a bank, that he is 100 percent sure that his plan is flawless. We always see movies with bank robberies being the criminals risky and edgy, and repeating sometimes the same techniques and same lines. Well with the new optic of this film, one is excited. He planned it so precisely, so extensively he believes there is no possible flail. Well, this declaration is the only thing that the movie can claim of distinguished.",/review/rw6257065/?ref_=tt_urv

","The film was fully incredible, it's not quite 9 status but it was really good, 8.5 would be spot on. I loved the twists and turns.
