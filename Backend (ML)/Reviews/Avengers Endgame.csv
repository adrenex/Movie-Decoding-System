17 June 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Andrew Garfield is terrific here!
","Under the Banner of Heaven was so much better than I expected. This series has been nominated for tons of awards and deservingly so, especially Andrew Garfield. He leads a star studded cast who all do an outstanding job. It's based off a true story as detective Jeb Prye (Garfield) investigates the murder of Brenda Wright Lafferty (Daisy Edgar-Jones) and her baby girl in Salt Lake City, Utah. He uncovers buried truths about the Mormon religion and the violent consequences to keep those secrets. What he uncovers shakes his own faith. It's definitely a tough watch but a must watch for any true crime fans.",/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2022,fraser-simons,8," Surprisingly effective, interesting, and well acted
","Though it could have been truncated, I thought this was surprisingly good. Interweaving re-enactments of stories from the Book of Mormon related to a double homicide in Utah, the detective-a Mormon himself-finds himself going through a trial of faith similar to the primary suspect: the husband of murdered mother and daughter, the deeper the mystery goes the more entwined it becomes with the church itself, delving into some esoteric and antiquated aspects of the LDS faith.",/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2022,skpn123,10," Excellent!
","Andrew Garfield is such a nice surprise in this series demonstrating a depth and range I didn't know he had - he was totally believable as a complex, conflicted Mormon detective.",/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Fantastic!
","Under the Banner of Heaven was a very well made series. As most people here have already pointed out Andrew Garfield is absolutely brilliant here. He's such a good actor in just about everything he's ever down and has been nominated for major awards throughout his career but he definitely deserved the Emmy nomination he got for his role in this. Garfield isn't the only one to shine in this though, almost the entire cast is terrific and is the reason why this show is so highly rated. Sam Worthington, Daisy Edgar-Jones, Wyatt Russell, Billy Howe and Gil Birmingham all deserving of recognition for their job in this. The writing and acting for this show is fantastic and I binged through the entire season in just a few days.",/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2022,Siebert_Tenseven,10," The Book Was Great, This Is Even Better.
","I enjoyed Jon Krakauer's book quite a bit. It's written in the third person, so I was intrigued by the inclusion of Jeb Pyre, the Mormon detective who uncovers the truth of the murders. He is not a real person and did not appear in Jon Krakauer's book.",/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2022,marveller-66,7," It's a rare tv show.
","Never seen anything that's so religious like Mormons and LDS. It kept me interested with Andrew's typical amazing acting and the mystery surrounding Daisy's character Brenda. And I also like the intriguing atmosphere. The entire story kinda feels like it's revolving around something small but it keeps getting more intense. There wasn't any major twists but the execution of the story, direction, visuals, music and cinematography deserves huge praise. I think people who are into religious stuffs will appreciate this even more. Anyways, this is a well-made show. And Andrew got an Emmy nomination!! Well deserved! 7.5/10.",/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2022,surfingnaked1,9," Well written
",This is very well written and produced. Andrew Garfield is well cast. Just look at all the terrible tv out there this show is easy to watch and engaging.,/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,karinahatem,9," Excellent
","This was a nice surprise, I thought this is going to be another boring tv show about some religion nutter, but quite the opposite, this was surprisingly good. Great cast and great performance, specially from Andrew Garfield, whom I thought he can do such a job. Good script, dialogue, the way events were going, one can follow the story very well. Loved how the suspense kept building up by the end of each episodes.",/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2022,milts-22133,8," Superb. Gripping. Worth It
","What an amazing show. Whilst I agree with all the other reviews stating Andrew Garfield being superb you can't forget the rest of the cast, they are all fantastic and make this show a definite must see. It is infuriating at times that there are actually people out there like this but that makes it even more gripping and keeps you hooked. If you're a fan of crime dramas/thrillers and/or love shows that you can binge in a few days and not worry about if they're going to drag as many seasons as possible out of it then this is for you. Well worth 7 hours of your time. Know some reviews have said it's a slow burner (I disagree)",/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2022,troydg84,10," Pfffff these reviews suck
",If you like the trailer you'll like the show. A few episodes in and it is gripping and intense. Very good. The religious angle adds intrigue if you have no bias.,/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2022,alanschulman,8," Worth watching
",The series is very good. I read the very good book years ago and this adaptation is worth watching. Not sure I understand the reviews that say it's boring. Certainly not. It's actually quite absorbing.,/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,lee_eisenberg,10," there are times when your faith won't help you
","Full disclosure: I've never read the book on which the Emmy-nominated ""Under the Banner of Heaven"" is based. What I can say is that the miniseries is one of the most intense productions that I've ever watched. Basically, it's about what religious fundamentalism can lead to. I'm talking some nasty stuff.",/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2022,BijeshNagesh,8," Crime Drama With Heart - S01 Review
","This captivating mini-series featured elements of family, faith, and the testing of both. Character-driven writing and exceptional directing made the show convey a significant message while holding fast to its murder-mystery and crime solving tropes and thrills.",/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2022,jellsworth88,10," I love the show but...
","You really need to either be a Mormon or ex Mormon to fully understand the show. Once you understand the culture you'll understand just how accurate it portrays Mormonism is the 80's and the extremist Mormons today. As an ex Mormon, this does trigger some PTSD from having grown up in a similar environment. I will clarify not all Mormons are like this, but unfortunately the extremists exist.",/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2022,terrillmelville,10," Sure it's sensationalized, but it's accurate as well.
","I served a 2 year mission and married in the Temple before I ever knew Joseph Smith had more than one wife. I give this as an example of the lack or honesty and transparency within the Mormon church. I've read the book twice, which I prefer to the series. I find the book more accurate and more convincing than the series. But what the series does so masterfully is show the intense faith in members and how that faith is born of a mythical history and how the members actively and subconsciously guard against anything that causes doubt (just read the 1 star comments and you'll see what I mean). Garfield does an amazing job showing the progression of his faith crisis. I've really enjoyed it.",/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2022,porcgi,6," Worth a watch if not over long and drawn out
","Compelling story which could have be told in about 4 episodes. The flashbacks to early Mormonism whilst helpful for those with little prior knowledge only detracted from the main story which I was eager to get back to when they occurred. Good acting all round...but the fake beards are just so amateur...(minor point)...dragged in places, so much so that I'd switched off near the end....shame...!",/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2022,SickJeezusIsSneezus,10," The bad ratings seem to be from Mormons
","The church's history is dark and a lot of devout Mormons get really defensive when its brought up. Just like how the detective reacts to some of the testimony of the husband on mormon history. In the end, the shows great so far. This is an excellent series that will get backlash from Utah and devout Mormons trying to protect the church.",/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2022,Moonstone55,10," Well Worth the Wait
","I was waiting quite a bit for this show, and I was not disappointed. Interesting story that keeps you wanting to know what happens next. Great script and acting. I can't wait to see more of it.",/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2022,gerardmartin77,6," Never-ending
",It just goes on and on and on ! It could easily have been 5 or 6 episodes. Its a good story but i was nodding off towards the end. K. I. S. S should have been the order of the day.,/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2022,bradencn,7," It's OK: Mormon Perspective vs. Secular
","I grew up a mainstream Mormon. I know the culture better than most. I've attended BYU, and have served a Mormon mission. I still attend church and appreciate the togetherness with my local church-going community. We bond. I do not currently live in Utah, but I HAVE lived in Utah.",/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2022,gemfesty,10," Intriguing dismantling of the Mormon faith
","Reviews will be plagued by Latter day saints offended by this content but this was based on a true crime story and explores critical issues of domestic violence, fundamentalism, and misogyny of the Church.",/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2022,miss_calais,9," Best thing I have seen in a long time
","I wasn't expecting this! Wow! I did not know anything about this show who was in it what it was about - nothing. I put it on by accident and ten minutes in I was locked , hooked, and I couldn't look away. Fantastic actors - it's Spider-Man - wow right and Gil from all those twilight movies lol and Sam Worthington form the Avatar movies - what fantastic casting - top notch - fair dinkum perfection!! I love shows that are about crimes but also from cultures or religions that are unknown to me such as the lds that ordinarily we wouldn't have a clue about or wouldn't care to know , this show tells a great story from all perspectives - it's bloody fantastic - just watch it!",/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2022,brookelaurispeakman,7," I'm Mormon, and this was good!...with exceptions
","Let me start off by saying I'm an active Mormon and I rated this a 7 so no, *all* Mormons aren't giving this the lowest rating.",/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2022,gokhan-erguven,6," The acting is good, the story and script is meh for me.
","I love crime-drama-mystery movies and series, and this mini series began promising. But as the episodes followed up, the series became kinda boring for me. It has too much religion/cult issues that it made it hard for me to follow. It's based on the book that is based on the real events and I'm not saying the story is bad, or the script - it's just TOO MUCH religion and cult for me. The final episode was good, though, and both Andrew Garfield and the rest of the cast are acting successfully. If you're not bored of extreme dozes of religion, you might like it.",/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2022,ikanboy,7," Don't confuse these guys for Mormons
","I lived in Utah when this happened. While the Lafferty story is worth pursuing, the decision of the writer/Director to make everyday Mormons out to be religious robots who use the same trite language of religious fiefdom is a disservice to the State of Utah. These guys were a cult, and every religion has offshoots and every religious offshoot has cults. Focus on the cult.",/review/rw8146919/?ref_=tt_urv
