19 October 2022,paul2001sw-1,9," As clever as stupid gets
","Charlie Brooker and Diane Morgan's horrendous, wonderful creation Philomena Cunk returns for another outing in this series. Cunk is amazing: stupid, credulous, only superficially interested in anything other than herself, with the ability to draw the wrong inference from just about everything. The writing is brilliant, a clever parody of mainstream ""quality"" television as well as an airing for the character; but Morgan plays the part so well its hard to believe she is acting. Surely her interviewees know what is coming; nonetheless, they do their best to take her as seriously as possible. It's great.",/review/rw8848893/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2023,fcalonso-53793,9," Brilliantly funny... every statement is a jewel
","I can watch the same episode like 20 times and still laugh to death. The script and dialogues are so brilliant. Each statement about human evolution contains a jewel in word playing- It is a pure Groucho Marx adaptation of Planet Earth. And Diane is just AMAZING. I don't even know how she does it to hold her face straight during some of the interviews... I had seen her in After Life and others and you notice right away how funny she can get. She deserves a price for this one and Cunk on Britain. It doesn't matter if they talk about dogs, discovering fire or cave paintings, there is always a brilliant sentence for each... A must see if you want to have some great laughs. So brilliant and funny.",/review/rw8848893/?ref_=tt_urv

1 February 2023,Oc115,9," Fresh humour, sarcasm & absurdity. Not for everyone
","It's the first time I watch a mockumentary, and the first time I see the character of Philomena Cunk. I love sarcasm and it's been a while since I've seen something this funny!",/review/rw8848893/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2022,concernage,9," The usual comedy genius from Morgan, Brooker and Co.
","How I'd missed good satire. It's becoming increasingly harder to write nowadays when the world is more surreal, but this is satirical commentary at it's finest.",/review/rw8848893/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2023,hawaiitalks,10," Hilarious and worth the time
","What an incredible series. I have not laughed like this watching a comedy show in a long time. Bwhaha...if you are a fan of history and have any clue as to the subjects Cunk is talking about, you will bust a gut laughing so hard. And even if you don't, it's still fun. Cunk is incredibly adept and professional...her deadpan schtick is spot on. And what's even better are her chosen interviewees who are either the most incredible experts become actors I've ever seen or seriously unaware of how ridiculous she actually is. Some of their expressions had me rolling on the floor with laughter. This is fantastic. I love it. I quite literally laughed out loud so many times throughout the series. Give me more! Definitely a worthy watch!",/review/rw8848893/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2022,b4blue,10," I was skeptical because ... it's BBC
","This show is hilarious. You might learn something about history but the true quality comes from showing how little, the ""experts"" know about life today. How can someone make assumptions about humans that lived 2000 years ago, when they can't answer simple questions with current references. All the jokes, cultural references fly over their heads. This is exactly why there are so many articles coming from so called experts that sound completely ridiculous. You could easily say that Diane plays a stupid person, but her questions are legitimate. The way the other person answers them, shows how much they can relate to common language and simple questions. It is just brilliant.",/review/rw8848893/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,lmrk5705,10," Literally crying with laughter
","I am not a fan of comedies, because, ironically, I generally do not find them funny, so I almost bypassed this Netflix series, until I realised it was British, and seriously, who are funnier than the Brits?",/review/rw8848893/?ref_=tt_urv

",Diane Morgan is amazing in this satirical mocumentary. It presents human history through lenses of brutal humor and irony.,/review/rw8848893/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2023,dreamtripp,7," Silly parody of pretentious history docs
","I do agree with another reviewer that this is somewhat of a Baron-Cohen ripoff (minus the misogynst rant about female comics) in that the interviewer feigns ignorance of the subject to get unusual responses and reactions from the ""experts."" However, if you like history or historical documentaries, but hate the pretentiousness of some of those shows, you will likely enjoy this. I chuckled quite a bit and found the series an enjoyable way to pass some time. No you won't really learn anything new, this is pretty much History 101, and yes, it's not a particularly original comedic set up but it is enjoyable and worth the watch. The humor is silly and at times crudely funny, but it is funny.",/review/rw8848893/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2022,GalAlba,8," Look! The Sopranos Is A 9 & I've Given This 8...
","If, The Sopranos, is a 9, this is probably a 7, but, comparing, The Sopranos, to any other TV, is pointless, because, it's so good.",/review/rw8848893/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2023,stephen_mac,10," Oh this is good!
","Having been hitherto unaware of Philomena Cunk and her insightful documentaries, this was a fresh experience. Witty and yet insightful, cringeworthy yet funny. A very watchable and entertaining series.",/review/rw8848893/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2023,astrologalexandracoman,10," marvellous!!!!
","In a world where u need like literally an hour to swipe through an infinite list of movies till u find a pretty acceptable one, this documentary is absolutely amazing! The dialogues, the way the actress entered the role, the informations delivered are absolutely extraordinary. You can learn so many things out of this documentary and at the same time you have a lot of fun. So totally recommend this and as a suggestion this is not a documentary to watch only once. The information is so deep and there are so many things presented that you simply cannot absorb all the information at once. So yeah!",/review/rw8848893/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2023,jimel98,10," Ah, DUH?
","I watched this last night, the whole thing in one sitting. I had seen the promotional poster and sort of blew it off a few times as I scrolled through the choices of what to watch. Then I accidentally left it on and got the coming attraction. Normally those annoy the heck out of me, but I'm actually glad this was played without being asked. I immediately saw the potential and decided to give it a shot. I'm very glad I did.",/review/rw8848893/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2023,larrybud2004,5," Just trying too hard
","It's not original, the concept has been done a million times. Think Borat, but not nearly as funny. Tries to be a mix between Borat and an Idiot Abroad, both which are brilliant, with actual ""history"" thrown in here and there.",/review/rw8848893/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2023,orcinussr,2," Can someone explain what's humorous about this?
","I consume Alot of content, too much objectively if I'm being honest - and I actually prefer mindless comedy at this stage of my life - but this is utterly meaningless - for her to act intentionally daft and perversely ignorant and then interview experts in various fields (who presumably are forewarned not to take her seriously, because otherwise.. Why be subjected to the obvious feigning of obliviousness to even basic concepts such as posthumous functionality of artists), and subject them to the most ignoramus and simply unfunny questions... I'm at a loss to even see the point, other than perhaps MISINFORMING viewers of facts that they may carry forward with them and spread like an cancer of stupidity - idk... Disgusting imo.",/review/rw8848893/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2023,ggpanta,8," Infuriatingly Entertaining

3 February 2023,inc-133-70013,8," A bit of information with a ton of comedy
","As a mockumentary series about human civilization, it's very funny, even if it's quite one-note. It reminds me ""Idiot Abroad"" for some reason very much.",/review/rw8848893/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2023,rrowzjones,1," Boring
","I might have found this show funny when I was 10 or 11 but I am not entertained by people pretending to be stupid, shallow and oblivious. The interviews with experts added exactly nothing to the level of humor since they were required to provide real world answers to her purposely dumb questions. Had it not been for her British accent, I wonder if anyone would have found it worth watching at all.",/review/rw8848893/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2023,jarnix-957-867652,3," Like Tiktok's cringe but 6 episodes
","The jokes are apparently written by a 6 year old child. If you enjoy all the cringe from TikTok and want to watch multiple long videos this might be for you. If you think that humor needs to be smart, this is not for you.",/review/rw8848893/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,dazw,10," Brilliantly unbrilliant..
","First of all, i absolutely love Diane Morgan, i have never seen her before this series aired on netflix, but as of now i am a huge fan...
Diane is in my opinion one of those people who are a lot funnier than they think they are, i laughed out loud throughout every episode...
I like to consider myself as a very, very amateur historian, and if you know a little about everything in history, i assure you, you will find this more than just a little entertaining.",/review/rw8848893/?ref_=tt_urv
