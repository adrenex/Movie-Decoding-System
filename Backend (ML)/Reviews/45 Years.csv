24 October 2002,Infofreak,," Tarantino's sleeper. An underrated gem of a movie.
","Many people were disappointed with 'Jackie Brown' when it was first released as it didn't live up to their expectations created by the more flamboyant 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction'. I admit that I was one of those disappointed fans. But as the years have gone by I have come to appreciate this movie more and more, and if you deal with what it IS and not what you thought it was going to be, you'll see that it is an underrated gem of a movie. 'Jackie Brown' is much more character driven and leisurely plotted than Tarantino's previous two movies. I haven't read the Elmore Leonard novel on which it was based so I can't tell whether this was a conscious decision by Tarantino himself, or it's because of the source material, but it might be a stumbling block for those with MTV-style attention spans. 1970s crime movie buffs will find it much easier going. The big names in the cast like De Niro, Jackson and Fonda are all very good, but the real standout performances in this movie are by 70s blaxploitation icon Pam Grier ('Coffy', 'Foxy Brown', 'Black Mama White Mama',etc.etc.) and a revelatory one from Robert Forster. Forster back in the day showed plenty of promise in movies like 'Medium Cool' but quickly found himself stuck in b-grade exploitation movies like 'Vigilante' and 'Alligator'. Fun stuff, but hardly Oscar material. Max Cherry is the best role he has ever been given, and he is superb in it. The fascinating thing about 'Jackie Brown' for me is that Tarantino's critics accuse him of making shallow and violent self-consciously hip crime films, but the central story of this movie concerns an inter-racial Middle Aged romance, something I haven't seen done in a believable or realistic fashion by Hollywood before. By doing this so well Tarantino shows he has much more depth, and is a much more interesting and braver film maker than his more acclaimed contemporaries. 'Jackie Brown' is a fine movie that hopefully one day will get the kudos it deserves. Don't overlook this one just because it isn't 'Pulp Fiction The Next Generation'!",/review/rw1926407/?ref_=tt_urv

When she gets caught by the agents Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) and Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen) with ten thousand dollars and cocaine in her purse, they propose a deal to her to help them to arrest Ordell in exchange of her freedom. Meanwhile Ordell asks the fifty-six year-old Max Cherry (Robert Forster), who runs a bail bond business, to release Jackie Brown with the intention of eliminating her.

","Being a huge fan of Tarantinos earlier efforts Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction expectations were of course high. Especially since Jackie Brown is based on the Elmore Leonard novel ""Rum Punch"".

","Coming as it did after critical darlings ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", it's perhaps not surprising that Quentin Tarantino's next film failed to - at the time - scale those giddy heights. Yet on reflection these days, when viewing Tarantino's career over twenty years later, it's one of his tightest works.",/review/rw1926407/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2011,Leofwine_draca,7," The forgotten one
","Out of all the films in Tarantino's career as director, JACKIE BROWN is the one people are least likely to have seen. This may be because it's the director's most subtle and relaxed movie, and also the only one in which the material he directs isn't his own; instead this is an adaptation of an Elmore Leonard novel. This doesn't mean it's at all bad, and in actual fact it's entertaining to watch Tarantino try something different for a change.",/review/rw1926407/?ref_=tt_urv

","Quentin Tarantino takes on Elmore Leonard? At first look not such a good idea but coming to ""Jackie Brown"" several years after its more or less lukewarm initial reception (released after so-called masterpiece ""Reservoir Dogs"" and the inventive and infectious ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Jackie Brown"" was seen as something of a disappointment) and being able to assess it without putting in context of Tarantino's filmography, ""Jackie Brown"" is surprising.",/review/rw1926407/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2015,utgard14,8," One of my favorite Tarantino movies
","Jackie Brown is considered by many (myself included) to be one of Quentin Tarantino's best films and also one of his most under-appreciated. There's love for it but it isn't met with the same reverence as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, or the same enthusiasm as his genre homages that followed. But it should be more widely praised as it's an exceptional movie. The direction is wonderful, the soundtrack is fun, and the script is full of memorable dialogue, as you would expect from Tarantino. The cast is terrific, led by '70s legend Pam Grier in her ""comeback"" role and Robert Forster in an understated performance that deservedly earned him an Oscar nomination. Every scene with Grier and Forster, separately or together, is a treat. As fun as Sam Jackson is, these two are what hold the film together and make it so enjoyable to watch over and over. For his part, Jackson does what you expect him to do. He's foul-mouthed and funny but still very menacing when he needs to be. Robert DeNiro and Bridget Fonda both offer amusing support. Chris Tucker has a brief but funny appearance. The movie has a lot of humor. That's one of the main things that makes it so enjoyable to watch over and over. It's a great film that probably holds more appeal to non-Tarantino fans than most of his movies do.",/review/rw1926407/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2005,paul2001sw-1,8," Tarantino grows up
","Quentin Tarantino follow up to the hysterical response generated by his suitably hysterical first two movies was 'Jackie Brown', an altogether more restrained film that garnered a somewhat more restrained set of reviews. Perhaps the relative lack of impact made by this film explains his subsequent return to extremes with 'Kill Bill'. But in some ways this is a shame, as there's a lot to enjoy in 'Jackie Brown', particularly in the universally first rate performances the director manages to get out of his distinguished cast. Robert Forster is wise and weary as a middle-aged bail bondsman, Samuel L. Jackson plays a criminal with all of the menace and none of the charm of his character in 'Pulp Fiction', while Bridget Fonda and a (cast against type) Robert de Niro are entertaining as a pair of useless crack-heads. Best of all is former blaxploitation star Pam Grier in the title role, combining human warmth and coolness under fire with considerable charm. The generic Ellmore Leanard plot is ultimately not quite as clever as it promises to be, and as as ever with Tarantino, both tone and taste are sometimes questionable: the early sequence 'Women Who Love Guns' is very funny, but it's quite unclear whether it's intended as satire or celebration. Nonetheless, once one adds in a typically splendid soundtrack, everything adds up to a movie far above the average crime thriller, and for all the breathtaking invention of his other movies, it's enough to make one wish that Tarantino didn't usually feel the need to try so very hard.",/review/rw1926407/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2013,kluseba,6," Authentic and well acted but it drags on for far too long
","Quentin Tarantino is a man between genius and madness who has created some of the best movies ever but also a few true Fails in my opinion. ""Jackie Brown"" is just between both extremes for me and is maybe his most unspectacular film to date.",/review/rw1926407/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 1998,Pluto-3,10," No Fancy Fireworks needed
","Contrary to Pulp Fiction which had a very unusual editing and flashy situations, Jackie Brown focuses more on characters that are basically humans with very focused problems, for instance getting older which is an eminent theme tackled in the film. No one's evil in all this. They all have interestingly real personalities and I felt strangely comfortable watching them talk, eat, kill and argue with each other. Tarantino is an excellent storyteller and I wish I could write dialogues as interesting as his. The film flows with a slower pace than Pulp, with all it's many streched takes and lenghty scenes, but by doing so leaves us more time to grasp the characters with all their differences. A more mature Tarantino. Still loving what he does. And he said it himself before the film came out: ""This one is at a lower volume then 'Pulp.' It's not an epic, it's not an opera. It's a character study.""",/review/rw1926407/?ref_=tt_urv

","Sometimes a movie requires more than one viewing. The first time I sat down to watch Jackie Brown, I wasn't so impressed. I didn't hate the movie, but I didn't love it either. I thought it was decent. The second time I watched it, I knew the plot already so I really got to indulge in the characters of the film.

","I see Tarantino's three films in the 90's, not including Four Rooms, as a crime trilogy of sorts, and Jackie Brown is the one that is considered to be the most underrated or by others as the weakest of Tarantino's catalog. I never really had high hopes for this film, because for one it just doesn't have that wit and charm that Pulp Fiction has or the unique style that was demonstrated with Reservoir Dogs. I have now seen this film a couple of times and even from my first viewing I thought this film was great and got even better the subsequent times I came around to it.",/review/rw1926407/?ref_=tt_urv

","Although different than some of Tarantino's more violent precursors,  such as ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""True Romance"" this is an excellent film. Where it lacks in violence however, the film makes up for in language earning it an ""R"" rating in the US. In certain scenes, I thought it Tarantino went to far with the explicit language and it seemed awkward and artificial, but that does not cast a shadow of over what I thought was an otherwise fantastic film. The editing and directing is excellent. There is good character development of the main characters, yet there is not one scene where the movie drags throughout its entire 150 minutes. I couldn't tear myself away from this movie until the very end.",/review/rw1926407/?ref_=tt_urv

","JACKIE BROWN (1997) ***1/2 Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Robert De Niro, Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton, Chris Tucker, Tiny Lister.  A marriage made in heaven: Elmore Leonard and Quentin Tarantino.  Excellent adaptation of Leonard's `Rum Punch' with Grier cast as the eponumous character, an airline stewardess caught between a rock and a hard place when she's pinched for drug possession after a cash pick up for arms dealer Jackson.  Double crosses aplenty -  both the rich characterizations and screenplay crackles with equally good acting particularly 70s survivors Grier and Forster (Best Supporting Actor nominee) the latter the epitome of understated acting.  Great fun and leisurely paced to the twisting uncompromising climax.  De Niro getting baked on weed with Fonda is one for the film vault.",/review/rw1926407/?ref_=tt_urv

4 May 2006,moonspinner55,7," Tough-talking but surprisingly low-keyed Tarantino curiosity...
","Quentin Tarantino's much-anticipated return to film-making following ""Pulp Fiction"" is an intriguing character-drama about a cool-headed flight attendant in cahoots with a merciless gunrunner who ends up playing both sides of the law to save herself from going to jail. From Elmore Leonard's book ""Rum Punch"", and full of punch-drunk people, dreamers, and low-life scuzzies with cockeyed, crazy ambitions. Great acting by nearly everyone (particularly Robert Forster as Pam Grier's bail-bondsman), but in the end it does feel a little thin--especially as the plot is stretched out too long. Tarantino's technical dazzle is certainly in place, but there's possibly too much exposition for the film to really hit the bull's-eye. Hot soundtrack, lots of funny/scary moments courtesy of the auteur, and some fine conversational dialogue, as when Grier tells Forster about her record collection: ""I was gonna buy a CD player, but I didn't feel like starting over."" *** from ****",/review/rw1926407/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2005,FilmOtaku,7," Decent, but don't expect a Pulp Fiction sequel
","""Jackie Brown"", the 1997 film starring Pam Grier as the title character, a flight attendant who smuggles cash into the country for a shady associate, Ordell (Jackson) is the third film directed by Quentin Tarantino. When Jackie is tagged by the feds, (played by Keaton and Michael Bowen) she is willing to give up Ordell because she has a plan of her own. Meanwhile, Ordell has proved himself to be a pretty nasty character, killing associates without even a hint of betrayal, so to say that Jackie is walking a tightrope is an understatement. Rounding out the cast is Robert Forster as Max Cherry, Jackie's bail bondsman hired by Ordell when Jackie is initially arrested by the feds, and eventual love interest, Robert DeNiro as Louis, an associate of Ordell's who is fresh out of jail and about to buy in on one of Ordell's gun selling schemes and Bridget Fonda as Melanie, one of Ordell's women, and object of both fascination and irritation for Louis.",/review/rw1926407/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2008,ThreeSadTigers,," An excellent, low-key character study with the usual Tarantino quirks
","Arguably director Quentin Tarantino's greatest film, and his third straight masterpiece in a row following the creative success of Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994), with his firm grasp of character, narrative and dramatic involvement at something approaching a career best. Unlike the first two films aforementioned, Jackie Brown (1997) is something an obvious step-back from the hip dialog, cool violence and narrative experimentation of his more characteristic work; with a mostly straight story placing the emphasis on the dynamics of the central characters and the continual themes of middle-age hopelessness and the need for fulfilment; all of which seems fairly radical when looked at within the context of Tarantino's career as a whole, and in particular his two most recent films, Kill Bill (2003-2004) and Death Proof (2007). Unlike the more self-aware, post-modern self-reference of those particular films, Jackie Brown is an entirely low-key affair; built around an outstanding central performance from Pam Grier and an accomplished ensemble cast that compliments the character of Jackie - as well as the theme of people living off past glories - with Tarantino capturing the action with a restraint and intelligence that many of his detractors might conveniently choose to overlook.",/review/rw1926407/?ref_=tt_urv
