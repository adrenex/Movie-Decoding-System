","""Luca"" isn't one of the deeper Pixar releases but it did have one thing that made it stand out for me...I liked it. The characters were enjoyable and the story, though simple, was delightful.",/review/rw7057287/?ref_=tt_urv

","Beautiful animation and a story of live and friendship. This is a wonderful film with a somewhat predictable plot but at a short runtime, it's a pleasure to spend time in this universe. Appeals to all ages and has a unique story telling perspective.",/review/rw7057287/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2021,joostkale,8," Is it groundbreaking? No, Its Luca!
","Stop it Pixar! Just stop it! Even the simplest stories are becoming masterpieces in the hands of Pixar. I don't know how they do it. It doesn't take the emotions risks like an Inside Out or Soul, nor is it a masterpiece of a screenplay like the Toy Story franchise, but boy oh boy I love it. Probably, its biggest flaw is also it's strength. It doesn't try to be the next masterpiece. It's Luca. It's a fun crowd pleaser with the typical Pixar emotional moments. It doesn't brake boundaries, but that's okay for me. For what it is, it's perfect! The story is sweet, and the characters are charming and lovely with real development. Yes, the story is a little predictable at times, but it doesn't bother the story much for me. I also love that the villain is the complete opposite of a twist villain. From the moment he pops on screen, you know he's the baddy, and he fits the movie very well. What makes this movie stand out, are the visuals. Holy crap, this movie is gorgeous! Literally the most beautiful movie I've seen this year so far. Also, the score, holy crap. Everything fits with the beautiful country that is Italy. I already know a lot of people will think it fits too much in the Pixar formula, but what can I see. The formula works, so why change it. It has his flaws, and it probably is not the next Pixar masterpiece, but it does work perfectly for what it is.",/review/rw7057287/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2022,TheLittleSongbird,8," Pixar in Italy
","Have loved Pixar for years, well ever since seeing the first two 'Toy Story' films and 'A Bug's Life' when they first came out. Pre-2010 their films were consistently never less than very good and their best efforts outstanding. Pixar did start to vary post-2010, especially in the sequels, but the past seven years or so has seen some of their best work in 'Inside Out', 'Coco' and 'Soul'. Did like the concept for 'Luca', even if it was not a creative one.",/review/rw7057287/?ref_=tt_urv

","Luca is a great Pixar movie! It may not be groundbreaking or revolutionary for its genre, but it is still highly enjoyable. The story is interesting enough to make one care about what will happen next, even though one should not expect events that are outside of Pixar's comfort zone.",/review/rw7057287/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2022,johnnyhbtvs27,8," Pixar Does It Again, This Time In Italy
",Luca is a beautiful looking film as one would come to expect from Pixar. I thought the idea of the story with fish becoming human on land was a great idea and pixar do well in making you care about the characters. The ending is both a sad and joyful moment and it's crazy to think Pixar can still get those kind of emotions from you after all these years. 24 movies in and Pixar have barely put a foot wrong (bar the occasional unnecessary sequel) and here they have another great movie.,/review/rw7057287/?ref_=tt_urv

24 January 2022,dennisvankekem,7," Beautifully made, but...
","Sadly enough It's the same old Disney formula that we are used to, for some reason Disney/Pixar keep churning out these beautifully crafted pieces of animated art with the most wild and unique settings but somehow keep opting for the most predictable and cliche storytelling in their arsenal.",/review/rw7057287/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2021,paolofurlotti-08596,8," I have really enjoyed it (and I come from there)!
","Coming from a place which is very close to Cinque Terre (where the imaginary Porto Rosso is meant to be part of) I watched the movie with a lot of expectations: well I must say that I have really enjoyed it: the story is nice, the main characters are enjoyable and both the location and the scenery have been well described (assuming we are talking about the '60s).",/review/rw7057287/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2021,theredsky,6," Luca Review
","Cute at the moment but ultimately forgettable. Luca is another big step in terms of visuals for Pixar. The movie looks and sounds absolutely phenomenal. This, Soul, and Coco are probably the best looking Pixar films ever. The score is really fun and works well with the film and the sound design is phenomenal. However, I can't let the animation blind me to the fact that the story and characters are very subpar. Luca and Alberto have good voice actors doing a good job with the material but their character development is thin and generic for a Pixar movie. I don't remember a whole lot about their characters other than they are fish people. All of the other characters felt one note especially the villain who is awful. The villain has absolutely no development, motivation, or interesting backstory compared to any other Pixar film and it sucks because Pixar has cranked out some fantastic villains. This story feels very generic and has very low stakes. There isn't anything wrong with a low stakes story but it needs to have a solid story built around it and this doesn't really have a solid story. Events just kinda happen and they form a story but there isn't anything deeper than that. It has some good themes of acceptance and belonging but they feel one note and not explored enough. I ultimately found myself getting bored at points which usually doesn't happen with Pixar. While Luca can excel in its visuals, music, sound design, and voice acting, it ultimately doesn't have a lot more to offer than that. If you like Pixar then check this out but don't expect it to be the next Ratatouille.",/review/rw7057287/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2021,mr_bickle_the_pickle,7," Not Pixar's typical best
","This is a Pixar film that just didnt really captivate me as much as others. Which isnt to say it was bad. Just kind of a basic story. Boy wants something more out of life. Adventure. Freedom from their hum drum day to day. Its the same thing we have seen before like The Little Mermaid (which is also about a underwater creature) or Beauty and the Beast for example. And I just dont feel like this film did anything really different to make this theme feel fresh. Again, not bad. Just kind of basic.",/review/rw7057287/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2022,fischer_patrick,7," Good family film

19 June 2021,briancham1994,8," Warming tale of friendship
","This film is nothing we haven't seen before. The premise will strike many as a literal fish-out-of-water story along the lines of The Little Mermaid, with an art style somewhere between Hayao Miyazaki and Hotel Transylvania. The setting is true to life, the animation is sparkling winh reflective details and the plot moments are comedic and add up to a compelling quest. However, the true strength of this film lies in the nostalgic dynamic between the protagonist friends, one an anxious introvert and the other an energetic thrill seeker. Together, they have fun, learn from each other and push each other's boundaries to achieve new and great things. It's a true testament to the power of friendship that exceeds its derivative premise.",/review/rw7057287/?ref_=tt_urv

7 March 2022,jboothmillard,7," Luca
","I remember seeing the trailer for this Disney/Pixar movie back at the beginning of 2020, obviously it was held back from release by COVID-19 restrictions, then it was moved from cinema release and put straight onto Disney+, but I'm glad I got to rent it on DVD. Basically, set in the summer of 1959, off the coast of the Italian town of Portorosso, in the Mediterranean sea lives young, timid sea monster Luca Paguro (Room's Jacob Tremblay). Many of the inhabitants of the sea fear the humans, scared they will be hunted for food, and Luca's parents Daniela (Maya Rudolph) and Lorenzo (Jim Gaffigan) forbig him from going up to the surface. One day, Luca meets Alberto Scorfano (Jack Dylan Grazer), a fellow young sea monster who lives alone above the surface, claiming that his father simply is not around much. Alberto encourages Luca to venture out of the ocean, showing him that sea monsters turn into humans when dry, but return to their true forms when wet. Luca follows Alberto to his hideout on Isola del Mare, there the boys bond and work together to make and ride a makeshift, fragile Vespa scooter. Discovering that Luca has been to the surface, his parents plan to send their son to live in the deep sea with his uncle Ugo (Sacha Baron Cohen). Luca retaliates and runs away with Alberto to Portorosso to find a real Vespa and travel the world. The boys run into Ercole Visconti (Saverio Raimondo), a local bully and five-time champion of the Portorosso Cup, a local children's triathlon. Ercole tries to soak Luca in a fountain, but local girl Giulia Marcovaldo (Emma Berman) helps the boys escape. Hoping to win money to buy a Vespa, the boys and Giulia team up for the triathlon, which involves swimming, pasta-eating, and biking. Unable to swim without revealing themselves, Luca and Alberto take on the biking and pasta-eating portions of the race, while Giulia, unaware of their true forms, agrees to take the swimming race. Ercole is intimidated by them and is determined to beat them and maintain his winning streak. The boys train for the race and befriend Giulia's fisherman father Massimo (Marco Barricelli), who was born with only one arm. Meanwhile, Luca's parents head to the surface to find their son; unable to identify him in in human form, they soak numerous children of the town with water to find him. Giulia teaches Luca about school, and the two bond over a love of learning, especially about astronomy. Alberto becomes jealous of Luca and Giulia's growing friendship. Luca starts ignoring Alberto's advice, wanting to go to school instead of travelling around the world, and they have an argument. During this, Luca's parents overhear his name being called, and recognise their son, they chase them but cannot catch up. Stopping by the sea, in anger, Alberto intentionally reveals his true form to Giulia, jumping into the water. But Luca, unwilling to give himself up, fakes being surprised at his transformation. Heartbroken and betrayed, Alberto returns to his hiding place. Giulia suspicious of Luca splashes him with a cup of water, seeing his true identity she sends him away for his own safety. Luca tries to reconcile with Alberto, who reveals his father abandoned him years ago, and he blames himself and should not have friends. Luca is unable to convince Alberto to co-operate, so says he will make things right by winning the race and get the Vespa on his own. After several mishaps, Luca takes the lead in the bicycle race, but is forced to take shelter when it starts to rain. Alberto arrives with an umbrella, but Ercole knocks it away and both boys are revealed as sea monsters. They flee Ercole, who now intends to kill them and collect bounty money, but Giulia helps them to get away. Luca and Alberto turn back to help her when she is injured, finally standing up to Ercole. They are defended from Ercole and the other fishermen by Massimo, who reveals that the boys are his friends. They are also officially declared the winners of the race, having crossed the finish line. Other disguised sea monsters reveal themselves, including Luca's family, and the townsfolk happily welcome them. When Ercole refuses to accept the changes, his own henchmen Ciccio (Peter Sohn) and Guido (Lorenzo Crisci) throw him into the fountain, fed up with his abuse and insults. Luca and Alberto buy a Vespa, but Alberto sells it to get a train ticket for Luca, allowing him to go to school in Genoa with Giulia. Luca's family, Massimo, and Alberto say their goodbyes to Luca and Giulia at the train station, all promising to stay in touch. During the credits, Luca meets Giulia's mother and attends school, showing off his sea monster appearance and later watching the Apollo 11 moon landing on television with Giulia. Massimo becomes Alberto's adoptive father, and Alberto and Luca's family have get-togethers. Also starring Sandy Martin as Grandma Paguro, and Giacomo Gianniotti as Giacomo. The cast are all well-chosen for their character voices, it is very similar to the Splash format with the fish out of water becoming human aspect, it is a terrific feel-good story of friendship and family, the colourful animation is superb, and there are plenty of funny and sweet moments combined, an endearing and enjoyable computer-animated coming-of-age fantasy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated. Very good!",/review/rw7057287/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2021,Bubba32618,7," I love this movie so much!
","I absolutely loved Luca so much! The characters are fantastic! I loved Luca as a character and all of the characters are fantastic love all of them, expect for the villain. The villain is pretty weak. The plot is simple but fantastic. I love the whole Italian esthetic so much. Luca's parents are some of my favorite characters in this film. The film is kind of slow at the beginning but once they reach the town which is named after the Studio Ghibli movie Porco Rosso, the film really really picks up. The ending at the train station was one of the best Pixar movie endings ever and I loved it because I cared about the relationship between Luca and Alberto. I loved the ending and it made me sad but happy at the same time. The film looks absolutely beautiful like most Pixar movies but I thought that the entire film looks just beautiful. I just love that this film takes place in Italy. Luca is amazing and I loved every second of it. Please see Luca!",/review/rw7057287/?ref_=tt_urv

22 June 2021,CinemaClown,," A Warm, Fuzzy & Effervescent Summer Delight
","A warm, fuzzy & lighthearted summer breeze from the animation studio that has set its standards so exceptionally high over the years that anything less than a sure-fire masterpiece feels like a mid-tier effort when it is still an impressive piece of first-rate entertainment. Luca is a victim of sky-high expectations that people have from Pixar Animation Studios and while far from their finest works, it does make for an ebullient & effervescent delight set on the Italian Riviera.",/review/rw7057287/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2021,ofersheffer,10," Adorable child and adult friendly film
","Just got out of a showing at the first day of screening of this film at a cinema in Israel with my family. Firstly, this film is perfectly made on the technical side. Everything looks beautiful and fully immerses you into the world created as if it were real. Underwater shots as well as shots of the city. The story is not completely unique, a ""fish out of water"", a story of a character learning and developing -- overcoming adversity as well as self doubt. A classic worth telling and it is a good feel good story with well defined characters, each helping the story move along. I think emotionally, this story gives a lot of things to think about and the communication between characters, Luca and his friends, are very well written and very believable even though we're dealing where the fantasy part (becoming a ""sea monster"") is an occurrence. If I have to nit-pick, I would say that the film on one hand shows that dangerous things could be dangers but also that it is important to confront your fears -- perhaps in an instance or two it might have been good to add a band-aid or something to make it slightly clearer that a character went a little too far. Overall, though, this is not an issue to worry about. I don't think any kid is going to jump off a cliff because of this movie and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for good character building with an arc. It is not Shawshank, or Empire of the Sun, but it is a lovely movie. Very happy this was my first film-house visit after the pandemic.",/review/rw7057287/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2022,timothyhilditch,5," Doesn't have the Pixar feeling
","A literal fish out of water story. A fish-boy feels the call for adventure to leave his underwater homestead to explore the outside world. Where the seaside town hates sea monsters. The animation has been tweaked they look more like aardman characters with less edges and bigger heads, of course Disney really likes its water engine its got now with great effect. None of the characters felt human their arcs kind of failed at the end of the 2nd act, to get them in the right place for the ending. Sure everyone wanted the ending which ends in the perfect way. But you need to lead all the characters up to that point changing them from 1->2->3, not skipping the 2nd step. Leaves me with the feeling of, needs improvement.",/review/rw7057287/?ref_=tt_urv
