5 September 2020,hwm-05554,9," Great movie, I hated every minute of it
",This movie is about how drugs can affect your life. Watching this movie really hurts. If you want to convince someone to stop doing drugs / live more healthy this is the movie to do it. Great acting (especially by Ellen Burstyn) and a realistic / convincing story but man is it painful to watch. This is the kind of movie you are happy to have watched at some point but you don't want to rewatch it because it is a real mood killer.,/review/rw2148214/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2016,planktonrules,10," A visual assault on the senses about the hellishness of addiction.
","Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all star in this incredibly painful film about four people who are chemically dependent. When the film begins, the first three folks are all using heroin yet seem to be reasonably functional. Over the course of the film, their lives begin to disintegrate badly. At the same time, Burstyn plays an older woman who becomes addicted to amphetamines because of an irresponsible doctor who tosses out pills like candy...and she goes from a relatively normal lady to someone who seems like she's crossed over the line from sanity to oblivion.",/review/rw2148214/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2004,bob the moo,," Great direction, great acting, great score, great script combine to produce a great film that is depressing but totally gripping even if it will not be to everyone's taste
","Harry and Tyrone are drug users who decide to try and make some money by cutting their cocaine and selling it on. This idea works very well and the pair start filling a shoe box with $20 bills - Harry even buys his mother, Sara, a television to make up for all the times that he used to steal her old one to sell it for cash. Sara has her won good news, after years of being an ordinary lonely widow she has the chance to appear on a television show herself and is actively dieting to try and fit into her favourite dress for it. With Harry's girlfriend pregnant but happily high, things take a bad turn when rival dealers start a war and dramatically cut the availability and up the price - forcing Harry and Tyrone to do whatever they can to get not only a fix but a supply to sell. Meanwhile, Sara's desire to lose weight sees her starting a regime of diet pills, morning, noon and night.",/review/rw2148214/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2002,Danfish,10," Like being repeatedly punched in the back of the head by Mike Tyson
","It's difficult to know what to say about Requiem For A Dream. I first saw it in the cinema when it was released in England and I have never seen an audience react to a film like this one. The climactic sequence, where the protagonists are effectively destroyed by their addictions, seemed to trigger a bout of heavy breathing in the audience. As it was ending I heard a few people crying. My girlfriend and I didn't say a single word to each other on the bus home.",/review/rw2148214/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2000,Rusty-61,," Good Lord!
","I was tempted to title this ""Drugs are bad, mm'kay?"" because ""Requiem"" was so sad I was desperate to inject some humor. Man, what a sad, scary, excellent, grim, disturbing, well-made movie. The more I read about RFAD and learned, the more fascinating it seemed. I'm one of those people who, upon hearing a movie is extremely shocking, has a burning urge to see it as fast as possible to see if it shocks me (especially unrated or NC-17), since I'm pretty jaded. So, I eagerly anticipated seeing it.",/review/rw2148214/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2001,Brian Scott Mednick,9," ""Requiem"" Is a Heavyweight
","You will not so much as want to take a sip of wine after watching this mesmerizing film about the horrors of drug addiction.  I was not a fan of director Darren Aronofsky's debut film ""Pi,"" but with this movie he proves to be a filmmaker of unlimited vision and style.  Four characters in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn are all driven to despair due to their drug abuse, the saddest being Ellen Burstyn as a nice Jewish widow who unwittingly becomes addicted to prescription diet pills that help her lose weight but drag her into a world of hallucinations and paranoia.  Burstyn is superb. It is so refreshing to see such a great veteran like her in such a challenging leading role, one in which she goes through a hell worse than that in ""The Exorcist.""",/review/rw2148214/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2000,dropthehammer2000,," Disturbing, Graphic and Great
","I went to this movie hearing plenty of buzz about how graphic the content was. Over the course of the movie you see just how Aronofsky wants to send his message to the audience. The characters start off with somewhat mild addictions and then next thing you know the four main characters are living in hell. I couldn't believe how low they all fell. This movie may be the greatest anti-drug message of all time. I dare anybody to watch this and to not be touched and frightened by these characters. Before the movie started I noticed the audience was quite loud and garrulous, but as it ended and the credits rolled the whole place was stone cold silent. It was amazing.",/review/rw2148214/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2000,Drakkhen,10," Absolutely Heartbreaking
","I had been looking forward to Aronofsky's follow-up to his critically acclaimed art-house film, Pi, of a few years back and when it did finally open in 1 theatre in Toronto, I gathered a bunch of friends to go down and see it.  Some have never even heard of Pi before.  For others, this would be their first Independent film experience.  However, coming out of the movie, we all agreed that it was one of most powerful piece of contemporary cinema that anyone has seen.",/review/rw2148214/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2001,tdao360,10," Brutal, honest, and a must see movie
","This ranks up there as one of the three most powerful movies I have ever seen in my lifetime (Full Metal Jacket and Grave of The Fireflies being the other two).  This movie shows the brutal honest side of addiction and over-indulgence.  Not just drugs, although it heavily shows drug addiction. Also shows how one addiction can lead to another and how damaging it can be for you.  I watched this alone, and felt so stunned afterwards, I had to call a friend just to calm my nerves.  Seriously, this is a brutal (one more time)  BRUTAL film.  The acting is wonderful - Ellyn Burnstyn and Jenniffer Connely are just wonderful in this movie, and Marlon Wayons was such a shocker in a serious role.  Everyone must watch it, for it's entertainment value, and more importantly, it's educational value.  But it leaves chills down your spine for it's honesty and unforgiving lessons.",/review/rw2148214/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2011,Leofwine_draca,10," Harrowing
","A tremendous movie, one of those ones that couldn't be improved in any way, shape or form. The script explores the nature of drug addiction on four different characters, showing how it grips and degrades them in different ways.",/review/rw2148214/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2017,Horst_In_Translation,8," The ultimate addiction movie
","""Requiem for a Dream"" is an American 100-minute film from 2000 and probably still the most known work by director Darren Aronofsky, who also worked on adapting Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel for the screen here, actually with the late Selby himself. The cast includes Ellen Burstyn, already an Oscar winner at that point, the super stunning Jennifer Connelly, briefly before her Oscar win, and Jared Leto, a recent Oscar winner, so acting talent is certainly enough in here. Still this is a film that is really a lot more about the story and the overall picture than about individual performances, even if Burstyn managed to get nominated again, which was her most recent nomination at the Oscars, maybe even her final. I find it pretty shocking though that the movie did not get any nominations for other cast members (Leto and Connelly would not have been undeserving), for the direction, for the script, also for the make-up and for the truly memorable soundtrack. It is without a doubt one of the very best films from the first year of the new millennium and besides Gladiator it is also probably the most known from that year.",/review/rw2148214/?ref_=tt_urv

25 July 2001,Funk Doctor,9," Suicidal
","Well, I´ve seen ""Pi"" and was fascinated. Now, there´s ""Requiem for a dream"" and my expectations were very, very high. That can be the downfall for a movie, but in this case I wasn´t disappointed. Aronofsky proves not only that he can direct a ""bigger"" movie, he also shows how one can do so without selling out. To be more precise: ""RFAD"" is one of the most disturbing and depressing movies that came out of the US for a looooong time. From the opening scene to its final curtain it´s...well, a requiem for the characters, who are all perfectly portrayed by their actors. Ellen Burstyn is unbelievable. The power of her performance can only be compared to that of Björk in ""Dancer in the dark"". Aronofskys direction is even more experimental than in ""Pi"" and some of his ideas, like his combination of sound and picture are really innovative and give his movie a musical feel -without creating a long music video. On the downside, you could say that this movie offers no hope, no solution - but then, this would´ve been a lousy compromise.",/review/rw2148214/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2001,jewinda,," The film-making quality is secondary- this film makes you FEEL
","Often hype about films lead to disappointment and after waiting 14 months after release for my local cinema to show this film, I was done thinking about it. Thank goodness too, rather than challenge my brain (not hard to do unfortunately) this film went straight for the heart, ripped it out and kicked it around the floor for 90 minutes. As the addictions plunged further into the depths of Hell, I felt myself more and more arrested by the film. I've never left a film shaking or feeling physically ill- not including Pearl Harbour, of course :)  You want to look away, but cannot.",/review/rw2148214/?ref_=tt_urv

","My God! ""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000), what a movie! It's always difficult to write reviews about perfect movies but I'm going to try. First, there are three adjectives which come to my mind to describe this movie and they're the ones which everyone thinks of: powerful, harrowing and heart-breaking and certain sequences remain engraved in the memories like for example, Jared Leto's wounded arm caused by drug.",/review/rw2148214/?ref_=tt_urv

","One of the anti-drug slogans in the 80s was ""Just say no,"" and it was given to us by not just the then First Lady, but by a slew of actors, many of them neck-deep into their own drug-induced binges fueled by too much money and a total lack of advice. If this movie had only come out then. Darren Aronofsky's powerful film REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is that ultimate slogan who never preaches its message: it just allows its presence to slowly filter itself into the images as the four people at the core of this story slowly begin to rot from the inside out as their ""dreams"" ultimately become replaced by the need to get high.",/review/rw2148214/?ref_=tt_urv

","I just saw Requiem For A Dream and I have to say, I was blown away. Not since 1995's The Basketball Diaries, has a film so accurately portrayed the craving and depravity of a person dealing with(or succumbing to) addiction. It is a beautifully articulated piece of artwork, intricately presented on a silver platter. Director Darren Aronofsky shines in his brilliant direction and style, in this depiction of the downward spiral of the lives of four people, living with their respective addictions.",/review/rw2148214/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm not going to waste space with a synopsis, as every second or third review provides one. A good indication of a challenging and original film is the number of 1/10 and 10/10 reviews, where the 1/10 reviews consist of just a few lines.  A pretty sure sign that those folks weren't able or willing to watch with an open mind.  Which is a good sign for casual viewers to give this film a wide berth.",/review/rw2148214/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2001,Quinoa1984,10," A unique look at addiction by Aronofsky/Selby; it's the best DARE movie never made (or would be made)
","Mr. Aronofsky's Requiem for a dream definitely is unique- no other film I have seen on heroin and/or speed addiction has been filmed or acted like this. And it helps that I saw it again, because on a first viewing I looked more for the performances, and liked it, but didn't really regard the actual cinematic technique for it with as much un-equaled regard as many others have (at the time I considered it more of an MTV-styled take on a very powerful topic). But now watching it years later (2006 I mean, despite what the date of this comment says) I watch it, having gone through lots of other film-viewing experience, and I like it a lot more. In a way what's really mesmerizing and heartbreaking about the picture is that the contrivances are not based in the actual script or story- not that there isn't one or two that might be hard to not have in there- but rather a sort of fashioning of continuous cinematic contrivance.

27 October 2009,Theo Robertson,10," Simply Put This Is A Masterwork
",I vaguely heard a few years ago that the director of PI followed it up by making a film based on a novel featuring drug addicts called REQUIEM FOR A DREAM . It got a couple of good reviews but I couldn't help noticing it took another six years for Darren Aronofsky to make another movie entitled THE FOUNTAIN which was one of the worst pieces of pretentious nonsense I ever watched . Still however the cult of REQUIEM FOR A DREAM grew and grew over the years . It is highly rated amongst the prolific voters on this website and has received almost aggressive praise from some quarters . And yet I had serious doubts to its worth as it was ignored by most award ceremonies and only received a very limited release in cinemas . Certainly I had no real intention of watching it until it appeared on a Sky movie channel . How good was it ? Let me put it like this - 72 hours after seeing it I still can't get it out of my mind ,/review/rw2148214/?ref_=tt_urv
