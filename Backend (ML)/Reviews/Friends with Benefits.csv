4 October 2014,SnoopyStyle,8," The perfect movie for Eminem
","Jimmy 'B-Rabbit' Smith (Eminem) is desperate to be a rapper. It's 1995 Detroit. With the support of his friend David 'Future' Porter (Mekhi Phifer), he aims to overcome his personal problems. His mother Stephanie (Kim Basinger) is a drunk. He leaves his girlfriend Janeane (Taryn Manning) when she tells him that she's pregnant. He chokes on a head-to-head rap battle. He has no place to go but to move back into his mother's trailer. His mom's boyfriend Greg (Michael Shannon) is a jerk. He has a part-time grimy auto parts job and then he meets Alex (Brittany Murphy).",/review/rw7313138/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2002,Chris Knipp,," Powerful silences
","Those who are saying `8 Mile' shows a vanilla-ed Eminem may have a point: this movie introduces him to a non-rap audience just as `Wild Style' introduced us to hip-hop.  But those who say Eminem is sanitized here for mall viewing have an odd notion of language.  Perhaps his CD's contain more inflammatory material than is aired in this movie, but what gets said here is most definitely not for any suburban grandmothers who aren't stone deaf.",/review/rw7313138/?ref_=tt_urv

","Rap is not my cup of tea.
But this movie is very well interpreted and perfectly holds water!",/review/rw7313138/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2002,PeteBDawg,8," A Quality Piece of Hard-Hitting Naturalism
","8 Mile probably isn't what you expect.  Given the cast and premise, you probably expect one of two things, either a silly excuse for self-aggrandizement or an overblown caricature of hip-hop culture.  You don't get either.  What you get is a brave film that is surprisingly culturally and intellectually rigorous and an aggressive film that is so emotionally intense that it seems to sometimes tear itself apart.",/review/rw7313138/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2002,dee.reid,10," A warm reception for Eminem fans everywhere
","""8 Mile"" is the new film that features controversial rapper Eminem in his first starring role.  The film itself is loosely based on his life growing up in Detroit.  Eminem plays Jimmy Smith, Jr. a.k.a. ""Rabbit"", a young man who is struggling to make things better for himself through ""battles"", which are freestyling rap contests that are usually held at a local nightclub. Rabbit chokes when it is his turn to take the microphone for the first time. His best friend, Future (Mekhi Phifer) is the host of these battles and strongly believes Rabbit has potential, but the problem is that Future often makes his decisions before consulting with Rabbit first.  Rabbit's home life is not much better.  He's broke, has no place to live, he's stuck in a dead-end job at a steel mill, and his girlfriend Janeane (Taryn Manning) has fooled him into thinking that she is pregnant.  Rabbit's mother (Kim Basinger), is on the verge of being evicted from her home and is slutting around with a man who is about the same age as her son.  Things in Rabbit's life take a turn for the better when he later falls in love with Alex (Brittany Murphy), an aspiring young woman who dreams of becoming a model and moving to New York to start life a new.",/review/rw7313138/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2020,cricketbat,7," Huh. Eminem isn't a terrible actor.
","I think the most impressive thing about 8 Mile is that Eminem isn't a terrible actor. Or maybe he's just playing a character so close to himself that he doesn't have to act. The story is predictable, so there's not a lot of tension while watching it. Also, I found myself wondering why these untelevised, unpublicized rap battles were such a big deal for grown adults. Nevertheless, it's a satisfactory underdog story that I'm glad I finally watched.",/review/rw7313138/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 2002,Chuckles11,," Dark but interesting
","I enjoyed this movie immensely. I thought it was a departure from the typical movies that star Hip-hop artists nowadays, which typically glorify the hip-hop lifestyle. Which is a very material lifestyle. This movie was pretty dark.",/review/rw7313138/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2017,daveym-649-444962,10," Great Film
","Watched this for the first time in 10 years recently. What a great film. A real statement of its time. Everything that was bad in the USA in the 1990's is perfectly illustrated, giving food for thought as well as inspiring empathy for a lost generation of young poor Americans. Living in Trailer parks, caught up in gangs - black against white.",/review/rw7313138/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2002,haydenisticparadise,10," this is a movie you can really 'lose yourself' in.
","This movie was amazing! I was pleasantly surprised! I wasn't an Eminem fan going into the movie but I'm certainly one now. Seeing how different things are on the 'other side of the tracks' was a big eye opener for me.  I loved the script, the actors, the music - basically I loved everything all the way down to the lighting.  It's got everything for everyone in it! Comedy, drama, action, fighting, guns, drugs, sex, and of course - Bunny Rabbit. I loved the movie. I laughed so hard I cried at times and then I just flat out cried at others. I would HIGHLY recommend it to everyone whether they are an Eminem fan or not. Do be careful trying to get into it though. We had to go to four different movie theaters before my 16-year-old friend could get in. They're checking I.D.'s on this one BIG time. Anyway - go see the movie! You'll love it! I swear on my grave it's the best movie that I've seen in a long time!",/review/rw7313138/?ref_=tt_urv

","Jimmy Rabbit is a white kid on the poor (black) side of town.  Growing up with this influence he has developed rapping skills but is too intimidated to showcase in the cruel `Shelter' battles.  Split from his girlfriend, Jimmy returns to his Mum's trailer park home and her young boyfriend.  He keeps his job in a pressing shop while working on his rhymes and trying to work out who, out of all the hopes and promises, will be able to help him work his way out of Detroit.",/review/rw7313138/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2006,reds_savo,10," Cool, refreshing
","This movie is something that really refreshed the Hollywood studio.It's preety different than the other movies because of it's really interesting plot and great cast(including Eminem).I have to say that Eminem did an amazing job on his debut and that he really was fascinating in a role that is maybe very autobiographical.Phenomenal soundtrack including 50 cent and Xzibit and of course ""lose yourself""-the academy award winner.I think that the rap contest scenes are the best part of the movie, because they were made so realistic.After all, a movie that is surely creating maybe even an another genre in something that i called movie industry and a great try !",/review/rw7313138/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2002,Showtime840,9," Excellent Drama
","I don't care for too many dramas, but ""8 mile"" was an excellent movie. Eminem was a better actor than I could have dreamed for him to be. He put on a great show, and kept me interested throughout the entire movie. Mekhi Phifer did an excellent job and is definitely a rising star in Hollywood. Brittany Murphy could have done a better job, but I didn't like her character development at all. It seems that she flip flops around so much that in the end you really don't know which side she truly plays. Kim Basinger did a good job. I don't watch too many of her movies. The last movie I saw of hers' was ""Bless the Child"" and that was a major let down.",/review/rw7313138/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2018,nicolasromeo,10," A piece of History of Hip-Hop
","8 mile is the best movie i have ever seen.
the story of this movie is about Eminem life and what he had done for become what he is now. from when everyone bully him to when everyone respected him and his music 
if you count Eminem is not an actor he done very well as a protagonist.
I recommend this movie because Eminem is one of the best artist in the work and who follow him have to see it for understand what he went through when he was younger.",/review/rw7313138/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2020,questl-18592,9," Rabbit Run
","Full disclosure, as someone born and raised in Michigan, near-ish to Detroit and a big fan of Eminem, I have a pretty heavy bias here. The fact that Mathers is actually a decent actor (admittedly he's playing a version of himself here) really was a surprise treat and he's obviously an incredibly skilled rapper. Some of the battle scenes where he's going at it with these other people were incredibly energizing. There's also a really fascinating case of racial discrimination involved here that's pretty unique really and it could've very easily been offensive but I thought it was handled very well, possibly because it's based on a real story.",/review/rw7313138/?ref_=tt_urv

","Even people who are not familiar with Eminem and his music (and, quite possibly, people who can't stand either of them) can enjoy 8 Mile because even though it is obviously a film based closely on his own life, it does not require any previous knowledge about him or his life or his music in order to understand and enjoy the film.",/review/rw7313138/?ref_=tt_urv

","Eminem is a `wonder-boy' product of the whiteÂ–bread underclass of outraged, disenfranchised youths  from a bleak Detroit in ` 8 Mile.' Curtis Hanson directed `Wonder Boys' with the same sense of caring about youths emerging for better or worse into their adulthood. But the star of this film is Eminem, and although it is a fictional story about Jimmy Smith, Jr. (called `Rabbit'), it is a loose adaptation of Eminem's rise from the ghetto of Detroit, on the dividing line of the 8-mile strip separating blacks from whites.",/review/rw7313138/?ref_=tt_urv
