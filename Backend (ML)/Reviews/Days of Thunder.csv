19 June 2008,Chrysanthepop,," It used to be a better meal, now it's a better life
","I've almost always loved Crowe's style of storytelling and never tire of rewatching 'Almost Famous' and 'Jerry McGuire' (which I consider his best). Even though his more recent 'Elizabethtown' didn't match up the standards of those two films, that too had its wonderful moments (and it was better than 'Vanilla Sky', Crowe shouldn't have attempted remakes). Like most of his films, 'Jerry McGuire' has soul. Crowe's eloquent screenplay is rich in humour, drama and lots of energy. It features some of the finest dialogues and one-liners like 'You had me at hello', 'Don't cry at the beginning of a date, cry at the end like I do'... and the actors deliver them marvelously. Another fascinating aspect is the brilliant characters. Each and every one of them, no matter how long the screen time, has something that contributes. Thus, next to an engaging drama and a magnificent comedy it is a fine character study.",/review/rw5827667/?ref_=tt_urv

","Many moving parts rhythmically sync together in Cameron Crowe's 'Jerry Maguire' - one of the best films of the 1990s. Hard to believe it's been 25 years, and just saw Maguire for maybe 20th time, so long overdue are my comments.",/review/rw5827667/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2007,classicalsteve,9," Agent Seeks Something Higher -- Possibly Cruise's Best Film
","At the 1997 Academy Awards, host Billy Crystal referred to the characters played by the five Best Actor nominees (of which Tom Cruise was one) as being ""a burned guy, a mentally-challenged guy, a mentally-abused guy, a paralyzed guy, and an agent. And four out of the five are treatable."" Of course Crystal was jokingly referring to the Agent as being beyond help. Among the figures of sports and entertainment, agents are often regarded as the necessary evil of the industry often with reputations as being the sleaziest of VIP's, just-above used car salesmen. Their antics which require a high-level of tough negotiations are sometimes seen as money-gouging and materialistic. In the film ""Jerry Maguire"", Tom Cruise decides to wear the shoes of a sports agent and walk around in them for just over two hours.",/review/rw5827667/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2000,tfrizzell,," Show Me the Money!!!
","""Jerry Maguire"" did something very strange in 1996: it had both critical and commercial success.  This was evident in the fact that the four other Best Picture nominees for the year were all independent productions.  ""Jerry Maguire"" shows the business world of America at its worst, in this case in the sports industry.  When Jerry Maguire, a sports agent, (played by Oscar-nominated Tom Cruise) has a breakthrough one night he realizes that quality is more important than quantity.  Of course he is fired from his job and loses all of his clients except Rod Tidwell (played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. in his Oscar-winning performance).  Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger) has left the business with Maguire, agreeing with his views.  However, Maguire struggles with his separation from the sports corporation (losing his fiance and the first pick in the NFL Draft).  However, he survives and learns that living well and loving well are the keys to happiness.  All in all, ""Jerry Maguire"" is classic Hollywood stuff made in the present-day.  Cameron Crowe's script and direction are subtle, but extremely effective.  Tom Cruise delivered his best performance to date.  Renee Zellweger proved to be the find of the year and Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s quotes and scenes he stole were enough to win him the Oscar in a very competitive year in the Best Supporting Actor category.  ""Jerry Maguire"" is not a perfect film. In fact it is flawed in many ways and is not very accurate in some areas.  However, its ability to mix comedy, romance, and drama make it a very entertaining film.  The performances are all excellent.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",/review/rw5827667/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2015,ThomasDrufke,9," Loyalty Without Intimacy
","Cameron Crowe is a genius. Every movie is made to make an audience member feel something. Whether it be laughter, horror, entertainment, or maybe just to be feel good. I simply don't think there is a better director at just making you feel good about life. He must be a tremendously happy person or maybe just too optimistic. No matter, I love his movies. Some would argue that at times his films feel too happy and perhaps unrealistic, to that I say nonsense. I don't mean nonsense as in they are completely invalid, the arguments have a point. I just don't think that always matters. Movies are made to be enjoyed and entertained by, and Crowe almost always comes through there.",/review/rw5827667/?ref_=tt_urv

","By definition, and depending upon who you're talking to, `Success' can be measured in a number of different ways.  It's winning the competition, celebrating a Golden Wedding Anniversary or, to many, just making the most money.  The first two are absolutes; you win and you make it to number 50. No gray areas.  If you're not dead, you're alive; you're either pregnant or you're not.  But in regards to that third item on the list, what are the parameters by which you measure that particular success?  Are there lines across which you will not step to make that extra buck?  Or do you do whatever it takes-- including selling your soul and sacrificing your very identity-- to make as much of the green as you can.  Is that success?  Or is that selling out.  Can there, in fact, be true success when ethics and integrity are absent?  It's the territory writer/director Cameron Crowe explores in `Jerry Maguire,' the hit 1996 film that landed him an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, a Best Actor nomination for star Tom Cruise, and captured the award for Best Supporting Actor for Cuba Gooding Jr.",/review/rw5827667/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2020,UniqueParticle,10," A heartwarming masterpiece!
",So many great parts I'm surprised Jerry Maguire wasn't up for more awards! Very entertaining comedy/drama/romance that is well acted and excitingly joyful. I love Tom Cruise in every scene and Cuba Gooding Jr. was legendary he deserved the golden globe he got. Cameron Crowe created such great glow of awesomeness and written cliche lines that are still used many years later.,/review/rw5827667/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2007,Isaac5855,8," A Richly Entertaining Character Study/Romantic Comedy with a first rate cast...
","Tom Cruise had one of his best roles and earned his second Oscar Nomination for Best Actor for his charismatic JERRY MAGUIRE, a richly entertaining comedy drama that is a seamless blend of character study and romantic comedy. Jerry is a driven and ambitious sports agent for an international agency that represents professional athletes in all sports who has a crisis of conscience that motivates him to write a ""mission statement"", which turns out to be more of a defiant manifesto blasting everything that is wrong in his business. he distributes his ""memo"" throughout the office and though it gets faint praise initially, it does end up getting him fired from the agency. We then see Jerry try to continue his business though he only has one client who agrees to stick with him. Director-writer Cameron Crowe (FAST TIMES AT RIDGMONT HIGH; ALMOST FAMOUS)solidified his position as a master cinematic storyteller with this epic story told on an intimate scale. His extremely deft screenplay is sharply delivered by a perfect cast. This role seems tailor-made for Cruise and he makes the most of it. Cuba Gooding Jr. won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his star-making performance as Rod Tidwell, Jerry's most loyal client; Renee Zelwegger was the find of the year as Dorothy Boyd, the secretary from the agency who follows Jerry when he's fired and agrees to work for him and eventually falls for him; Bonnie Hunt scores as Dorothy's sister as does Kelly Preston, in one of her best performances as Jerry's shark of an ex-fiancÃ©e. Regina King should have received an Oscar nomination for her solid performance as Tidwell's wife, Marcy; Jay Mohr is quite funny as Bob Sugarman, a rival agent who is battling Jerry to represent another football player (Jerry O'Connell)who is being watched over by his protective dad (Beau Bridges). A rare gem from the 1990's that is not only grandly entertaining, but vividly real...there's nothing false or affected here (though some might find Gooding's Tidwell a little over the top), this film is one of those rare treats that is long, but you hardly feel it. A real treat and a must for Cruise fans.",/review/rw5827667/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2009,LeroyBrown-2,7," Good script, good acting equals good film.
","""Jerry Maguire"" has to rate as one of the most quotable movies of the last decade and a half. It's given us the lines ""Show me the money"", ""Help me, Help you"", ""You had me at hello"" and ""You complete me"". And it's that last line, that really describe this movie. It's really about the growth of an individual. We see Jerry Maguire the character, grow from just an agent to becoming much more, it's not an easy trip but for the most part it's an entertaining one.

","Fairly entertaining sports film that works best when it's focused on Tom Cruise's at-loose-ends agent and his client, played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. But the film crashes and burns when it becomes about the love story between Cruise and Renee Zellweger's character. Writer/director Cameron Crowe has proved time and again that he can't write female characters worth a damn, mostly because he treats them the way adolescent boys treat women when they ""discover"" them for the first time.",/review/rw5827667/?ref_=tt_urv

","I just finished watching this movie for the third time and I still love this movie as much as I did after the first time I watched it. Maybe even more! As I already said in the title of my review, only Cameron Crowe can make this kind of movies. Movies about life the way it is and life the way it should be.

26 February 2007,Tom-2128,9," Successful multi genre
","This movie is a comedy, drama, romance, sports movie, and a money movie (e.g. Wall Street, where the main character is trying to make a lot of money). The problem such a movie faces is maintaining a consistent tone. Remember Prizzi's Honor? JM solves that problem by using restraint. It doesn't go over the top, although its characters sometimes do. It has funny moments, but it's not Animal House or American Pie. It's a drama, but it keeps the stakes low. This isn't Armageddon: they aren't trying to save the world. There are no life or death decisions. The romantic stakes aren't that high either: Renee Zellweger loves Tom Cruise, but she's been in love before and if this doesn't work out, she will be again. The only really high stakes are the money. By keeping the stakes low, JM let's us watch it with a bit of detachment.",/review/rw5827667/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2010,TheLittleSongbird,8," ""Show me the money!""
","Jerry Maguire may be rather overlong and a little pedestrian in places, but overall it is a very interesting and somewhat unusual film. The concept really intrigued me and one of the main reasons why I saw Jerry Maguire in the first place, and this concept worked really well thanks to the well written story and the witty and poignant script. Jerry Maguire is also beautifully filmed with lovely cinematography and scenery, and the soundtrack is warm and infectious. Cameron Crowe's direction is very good, as are the relationships between the characters. Jerry Maguire also benefits from some superb performances. Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances here, and he is perfectly matched by Renee Zellwegger at her most beautiful and the adorable Jonathan Lipnicki. Though the real star is Cuba Gooding Jnr who is absolutely marvellous as Jerry's sole remaining client. To conclude, a very good film, well worth watching for the performances and concept alone. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw5827667/?ref_=tt_urv

","A huge hit for all involved upon release in 1996 (where does 20 years go?), for some reason I've never shown Jerry Maguire ""my money"" and watched it in its entirety, despite it being the film that spawned an endless count of imitators trying to redo instantly classic scenes or launched the careers of Renee Zellweger and the Oscar winning Cuba Gooding Jr.",/review/rw5827667/?ref_=tt_urv

","If Jerry Maguire were made 30 years earlier I can see Jack Lemmon playing the title role.

19 April 2006,GilbertAlmond42,8," An amazing film
","I refused to see Jerry Maguire for several years, assuming it was a cheap movie about money, sports and sex. When i finally watched it on TV, i was blown away. This movie is about hope, redemption, love, and finding out the meaning of life. Tom Cruise does a spectacular job playing someone with nothing to loose, and Cuba Gooding's performance brought tears to my eyes. Renee Zellweger fits perfectly by having great chemistry with Jerry, and by having a normal, plain look. This film works because it's so real and easily plausible; its a witty, romantic drama more than a romantic comedy that proves its never too late to start over or take a risk.",/review/rw5827667/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,5," Not sure whether this is a chick flick or just a generic bad movie...
","I saw this a few years ago, and didn't quite see why everyone was praising it so much. I attempted to watch it again a year or two later, still desperately trying to figure out what everyone was praising the movie for. Then I borrowed it from the local library a few days ago, and today I saw it again... I'm still as baffled by its reputation as a good film as I was when I first saw it. It seems to be a chick flick, since just about all of the elements are there... but maybe it is just a generic bad movie that has gotten popular because of the star power or whatever. I mean, everything in the movie... the obnoxious little kid, the weak attempts at comedy mostly consisting of old stereotypes, the unbelievably poorly implemented and uneven love-story... no. Just no. I can only guess that the popularity of this film lies in a strong audience of people who are either easily impressed or girls who are into chick flicks. Possibly both. The plot is OK, but the pacing is awful. It moves unforgivable slowly and seems twice as long as it is... at least. The acting is flat or overplayed... everyone seems either terribly uninterested in the material or to not be sure how to perform, and therefore overdo it. I can't believe that this was actually done by Cameron Crowe... come on, he made Almost Famous and Vanilla Sky, two movies that are great at best and impressive at the least. How could he screw this up? I recommend this film only to the biggest fans of the people involved in the making of it, and possibly fans of chick flicks. Everyone else; don't listen to the hype. It's not the least bit interesting or involving. 5/10",/review/rw5827667/?ref_=tt_urv
