23 May 2020,aciessi,9," Home Schooled.
","Released on television, but truly meant for the big screen. Bad Education is an astounding film about a good-old fashioned, American white collar crime in Roslyn, New York. Directed by Cory Finley, this is a huge step-up from Thoroughbreds. Hugh Jackman and Allison Janey are Oscar-worthy here. Jackman is slick and slimy as Dr. Frank Tassone, who's reputation as the world's best superintendent comes crumbling as he's exposed as a co-conspirer in the largest public embezzlement scheme in American history. Geraldine Viswanathan and Ray Romano knock out their respective roles as well. All around, the talent on and off-screen is exceptional here. Don't let this one go under the radar during your time at home. You don't even have to wait until HBO Max launches. See it now.",/review/rw5748882/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2020,grantss,8," Compelling viewing: very interesting and entertaining
","A school board discovers that one of its administrative staff has defrauded the school out of about $250,000. They have the staff member pay back the money, resign and leave it at that. Without knowing this, a journalist on the school newspaper starts investigating the school's finances and discovers that the issue may be bigger than what they school realises.",/review/rw5748882/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2021,AlsExGal,9," Hugh Jackman is so underrated
","He plays school superintendent Frank Tassone who, over a decade, embezzled millions from Long Island's Roslyn school district. But he wasn't alone. Embezzling even more was administrator Pam Gluckin (Allison Janney), who is also terrific. If you only know her as the 50 something libertine grandma in ""Mom"" this is a real departure from that.",/review/rw5748882/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2020,Diablo1616,7," Well Done
",This movie is much more than the famous early 21st century scandal and the actors chosen to portray their respective roles are undoubtedly best placed in every moment.,/review/rw5748882/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2020,ferguson-6,7," public trust broken
","Greetings again from the darkness. Trust in our national institutions may be at an all-time low, but it's not like there haven't been plenty of events over the years to make us wary enough to demand attention and oversight. This story of the 2002 Nassau County Schools scandal is a prime example. This is director Corey Finley's follow up to his clever and twisted THOROUGHBREDS (2018), and the script is from writer Mike Makowski, who was a student in the district when the scandal hit.",/review/rw5748882/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2020,film_watcher_,8," Surprisingly outstanding
","Great performances here and a fascinating ""small town"" story. I was thrown for a complete loop with this movie. At a certain point I was glued to the screen until the ending credits. It's highly compelling. On the surface it seems rather predictable, but it soon spirals into a much more interesting story with some quite powerful and emotional moments. Some of the most intriguing stories really do come from small communities and unassuming characters. I can definitely see why an actor the caliber of Hugh Jackman signed on for this. I got far more out of this movie than I ever expected to, and it has genuinely stuck with me. Really impressed with this and would absolutely recommend to others. It seems like Netflix is really finding it's niche with projects like this. This is a movie that's perfect to watch during quarantine and doesn't require a cinema screen, which was wonderful.",/review/rw5748882/?ref_=tt_urv

26 April 2020,jimpowellsf,9," An instant favorite
","I was uninterested in watching this movie, but thought I would give it a shot given that it's based on a true story. Allison Janney is amazing, Hugh Jackman delivers a great performance, Geraldine Viswanathan is stellar (as always), but the entire cast is great (truly). From the beginning the film tells the story in captivating and compelling ways. The momentum builds over the course of the hundred minutes. Edge of your seat storytelling. This could have been made into a miniseries. It's just that good. Do yourself a favor and see it.",/review/rw5748882/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2020,mrpicky,7," solid
","Great cast, great story, strong creative script. Interesting story of corruption of surprisingly large scale in underfunded education field. Nice work on showing many sides of main characters. Unlike most of movies that keep everything black and white. Allison Janney killed it again. one problem tho: they could focus more on ordinary teachers that lead poor lives. How that was a major spit in their faces.",/review/rw5748882/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2020,UniqueParticle,9," Excellent all around
","A very well filmed, incredibly written, and acting! Cory Finely 2nd project after Thoroughbreds which was also great! I agree with what was said in the trailer among Hugh Jackman's best in his career. The story is about scandals, school projects, administration, and families all of which dealing with different things.",/review/rw5748882/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2020,deloudelouvain,9," Great movie, great performance from Hugh Jackman
","It started like an interesting movie to watch, maybe a bit slow at first but still very enjoyable to watch due to the excellent acting, but then came the second part that was just sublime. As an European I never heard of this scandal so to me it was all a surprise. Surprised because I didn't knew the story, and not surprised because there are always people taking liberties when there are large amounts of money available. The fact the movie is based on a true story makes it even better, that was pure entertainment of the highest order. Hugh Jackman probably gave the best performance of his career, in a completely different role we're used of him. No Wolverine superhero scenes here, just playing a day-to-day normal character, but done very well. The rest of the cast was excellent as well, everybody added something to this intriguing story. Bad Education is one of the better movies I watched this year, and believe me I watch a lot of movies...",/review/rw5748882/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2020,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," I guess there's only so much you can do with this story...
","...but adding an overbearingly loud satirical score, doesn't make this a satirical dark comedy. For that matter, where was the comedy?",/review/rw5748882/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2020,Quinoa1984,10," Magnificent tragicomedy; Hugh Jackman is something else here!
","Bad Edcuation is one of the most incisive, sharp-as-a-new-knife and darkly funny films about politics since Election - and like that, it goes to show that focusing on the school system, from the corrupt to the innocent and everything in between, to get to the heart of all that. When it comes to power and control (and what journalism can do, always worth being reminded), this story is as potent an exploration as one could ask for right now, and it's all painfully relevant to right now.",/review/rw5748882/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2020,Xavier_Stone,5," Just a simple movie
","This movie is not compelling as several fake reviews have stated. I guess this is a new word to describe movies.

28 April 2021,joevanolo,2," What a boring movie
","This movie is like having a very boring friend tell a very boring story that when its done everyone moves on with their lives as theres nothing important to talk about it and you feel like that was a waste of time, boring story, boring direction, a waste of time.",/review/rw5748882/?ref_=tt_urv

6 March 2021,smithnumber,5," It's ticks all the boxes except for the ""Not boring "" one.
","I can just imagine the production meetings on this one. ""We've got Alison and Hugh and this is an sure-fire Oscar nomination for him!"" and ""It's true story about rich people and greed. everyone hates the rich!"". There's only one problem - this film is neither engaging or funny enough to hold attention. In short, it's got all the right elements but it's just a bit boring.",/review/rw5748882/?ref_=tt_urv

16 May 2020,allanwatts-02122,6," Not bad, not great, good enough
","It didn't take itself too serious. The movie was obviously dumbed down to an almost comedic level & put together as compact as possible keeping viewers interest just long enough. Jackman does a great job & really kept the movie together. Lucky enough Jackman was the main character, great acting. I think the movie would have worked on a more serious note also, there was enough detail available based on true facts to be serious or in this case a more relaxed option. Worth the watch.

","Loved this film! Great script, direction and fantastic acting. Also a film with a message for today.

Well done and thoughtful film!",/review/rw5748882/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2020,Steve-Zoicks,2," Not an Emmy worthy movie
",Hugh Jackman is a great actor however I canning see how his role in this movie is Emmy worthy? It was a slow moving movie with no impact. The actors were bland and the plot was very easy to see within the first 15 minutes of the show. Drama at its disappointing end.,/review/rw5748882/?ref_=tt_urv
