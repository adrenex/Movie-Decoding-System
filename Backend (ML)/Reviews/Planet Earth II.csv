","Amazing , sweet ,little ,funny ,feel good cinema thats what ""The Little Rascals ""   is all about .Quite amazing to see how small kids doing big deeds.The starcast is full of lovely kids and they make this movie a treat for the eyes to watch. The basic foundation of the Heman woman hater club shakes down when one of their member,Alfaalfa,  falls for Darla and there it all starts the fight for Darla and the story moves ..... When the movie is over there is something which makes u feel good.Director penelope spheeris completely justifies the subject the movie needed a good screenplay and its brilliant in the movie. Overall a good delightful movie to watch.",/review/rw2645481/?ref_=tt_urv

","I can not believe some of the peoples comments about this movie being stupid. What did you expect from a kids movie, to come out of it feeling inspired? No, it's just a happy-go-lucky kids movie which i can proudly say i have watched over and over again to this day! And one user commented 'How do the kids expect to marry women in the future, with a Woman Haters club' ? Oh my god, get over yourself! Although i haven't seen the original to this, i can praise this version as a feel good film.",/review/rw2645481/?ref_=tt_urv

5 May 2004,Charles_Bronson,," Ah, good times
","I've always loved this movie. I first encountered it when I was in 4th grade. We would almost always watch this or Alladin during our school parties. I am now almost 19 years old here in 2004 and I gotta watch this movie once in a while to recapture the good ol' days of my childhood. This movie is indeed really cute and good for the whole family. I remember my cousin borrowed it from me and I did not get it back for nearly three years because she loved the movie to death. I am just glad to see that some of kids have somewhat of a career after this. I was wondering what happened to Darla, Alfalfa and the gang. It's hard to believe that most of the Rascals are now high schoolers and growing up. As I write this review, I have an urge to watch the movie again. 10/10...loved it as a kid and as a young adult, I still love it!",/review/rw2645481/?ref_=tt_urv

","I love this movie. To me it's one best kids movies ever, it just brings you back to those innocent times of being a child. It's fun, its cool, its when you start to notice girls for the 1st time. This is one for the ages. It still resonates with young kids today. It has genuine performances by child actors.",/review/rw2645481/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 1999,thefan-2,8," Time warp megafun
","Imagine a group of kids from the 1930s somehow inhabiting a modern city.  This movie made me and my kids so happy that we went back to see it again the next day and bought the video when it came out. Its theatrical run didn't last very long, so most people never saw it.  Give it a try, especially if you're a kid or have kids of your own.",/review/rw2645481/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2017,ironhorse_iv,6," Little Rascals is indeed charming, but don't kid yourself, this movie is heavily flaw, as well. Still, it is a guilty pleasure of mine. I like it.
","In the 1990s, it seems like every major movie studio in Hollywood, was making remakes of classic adventures TV shows about neighborhood kids from mid-1930s to the late 1960s. Some of them, were minor hits; others were horrible retellings like 1993's 'Dennis the Menace'. However, the majority of them, fall between all-time best great & super awful. 1994's 'Little Rascals' is one, such mediocre film. The movie directed by Penelope Spheeris was a little too bog down on nostalgia; that it felt like a series of various sketches, oddly cobbled together, in a paper-thin set up about Spanky McFarland (Travis Tedford) trying to sabotage, one of his members, Alfalfa Switzer (Bug Hall)'s relationship with Darla Hood (Brittany Ashton Holmes), in order to get him, focus back on track, on winning the local go-cart derby race. It just doesn't mesh well. Plus, all of the sketches really does slow the pacing of the movie, down. A good example is all the scenes of the gang trying to make money, in order to rebuild their burn down clubhouse like the bank & freak-show scenes. None of those sequences were really that funny, nor makes any of much sense with the main plot; seeing how the gang have enough material to build another go-cart, yet not enough for a clubhouse. Honestly, the driving force of the plot could had been simple down to the idea, that the race had a prize money, all-along. It would save the movie, a lot of time. Also, as much as I love the ballet & soap singing scenes, those moments weren't really needed. It does feel a bit forced. It could had been cut, if Universal really wanted it, like they did with their VHS & DVD releases; when it came down to other scenes. Many of these versions, are so unlike the original movie, we saw in theaters. However, most of them, works better in watchable. Don't get me wrong, I do like seeing the familiar of sight gags and slapstick situations, taken straight from the original series of comedy short films produced by Hal Roach from 1922 to 1944, even if its bit sexism & anti-homosexual. However, I do wish they add more uniqueness with them. Some of the humor seem a bit repetitive, recycled & outdated. Even, when they did try something new, like updating the source material to a modern setting background. It still came across as somewhat jarring, because how the children is dressed in 1930s style of clothing. If anything, the movie should had, kept the 1930s settlings, just add new jokes to counteract, scenes, mirroring shorts like 1937's 'Hearts are Thumps & 1939's 'Auto Antics'. Furthermore, the movie should add more scenes of the children acting like themselves, rather than imitating adult. Lots of the big wordy dialogue given here, sounds so unnatural, coming from the mouth of a small child. I kinda wish, the movie gave them, simpler sentences to speak. This film really lacks the raw nuances of child performers acting like real children. Nevertheless, not all things, about this film, were bad. I do like how the cast is more integrated and less racist than the original. Also, the main actors were not that bad. Bug Hall & Travis Tedford were born for these roles. There are also some great cameos from Reba McEntire, Mel Brooks, and Lea Thompson to name a few. Even the sight of future president, Donald Trump wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, I would love to see, more cameos from past 'Little Rascals' alumnus, like Jackie Cooper, Eugene Jackson & Robert Blake in minor roles in this film. Sadly, this movie was lacking some of those. However, the movie makes it up with action set pieces with great stunt work. The Go-Kart race was somewhat compelling to watch, even if it's a bit over the top. Also, the soundtrack by composer, William Ross that goes with it, and most of the movie, really does seem like it came from yesteryear. It's beautiful to listen to. In short, while, 1994's 'Little Rascals' will never outdo the original short films from the 1930s/1940s. It does beat 1936's 'General Spanky' & 2014's 'The Little Rascals Save the Day' in being a better 'Our Gang' film. Overall: Watching a kid movie like this is like watching a blender without a lid. It's messy, but it's cool to witness. I highly recommended seeing the film. I kid you not.",/review/rw2645481/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 1999,PJS-5,," *****:perfect 5 stars,these kids truly do the darndest things
","This is a true masterpiece of crazy-comic children films because, well for one thing, this is no disappointment to those who enjoyed the original Little Rascals series. A highly cute, funny, adorable film to anyone. True, the idea of a ""He-Man woman haters club"" is offensive to all you feminists out there, but remember the story of the film took place when these kind of things commonly happen. So what I have to say is this is an excellent-quality film for any little rascals, & besides the rascals in the film are kinda like ""Rugrats"" but they're in the proper age group of kingergarten, so if you love seeing cute kid hijinx by all means, see this film.",/review/rw2645481/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2000,Mike-DD,8," Rascally hilarious
","I enjoy movies where kids are the main stars, and except for a few, have always highly rated them. This ranks as one of the better ones I've seen. Though I never had the chance to watch the series, I can imagine how hilarious it must have been judging from the movie. The antics of the group of young boys and girls in their eternal 'war' against one another is uproarious and a delight to watch. Watch how one of the boys try to stay within the girl-hating club while trying to woo a girl at the same time - it'll remind some of us of our childhood just before we enter adolescence. Fact is, I think the parents would probably enjoy this just as much for the same reason - how cute we were before we became 'teen horrors'!!",/review/rw2645481/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2000,helpless_dancer,7," brats run amok
","I laughed my head off at these ill behaved little rapscallions. However, in the real world I would have cheerfully kicked their rascally little butts. Nothing realistic about the behavior of these kids at all, but I don't think that was intended. Lots of zany antics [some re-done from the old shorts from years back] and many belly laughs left me feeling good after the film was over. Thumbs up.",/review/rw2645481/?ref_=tt_urv

25 August 2015,anaconda-40658,4," Inferior to the TV Show.
","The Little Rascals (1994): Dir: Penelope Spheeris / Cast: Bug Hall, Travis Tedford, Brittany Ashton Holmes, Kevin Jamal Woods, Zachary Mabry: Misguided family film about trouble and innocence. It regards a group of children who hang out at a club house with a strict rule against girls. This becomes a problem when one of the members is caught courting a little girl. This is the film's first problem. There might be nostalgia for fans of the classic TV show but for a family film this presents themes that may be above the age group this is aimed at. The relationship between one of the Rascals and the girl comes off somewhat disturbing in terms of dialogue that skirts adult. After the club house burns down they attempt to raise money and the method is a kids race for a cash prize. This might have been the proper angle to present this material. Director Penelope Spheeris is coming off great success with Wayne's World but here she is backed by a production that resembles the classic program but without a screenplay worthy of it. It doesn't even seem nostalgic for those whom may celebrate the popular TV program. The young cast play out their roles with certain appeal but the adult communication is a distraction. Another issue is the lack of parents. There is numerous celebrity cameos supporting the show's popularity but the end result is a bigger mess than anything the rascals conjure up. Score: 4 / 10",/review/rw2645481/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2018,Leofwine_draca,2," I wish they hadn't bothered
","An attempt to replicate the success of the 1920s - 1940s film series for modern audiences, THE LITTLE RASCALS is a lamentable enterprise which has completely the wrong look and tone. I admit freely that I didn't laugh a single time. This is merely a badly-acted, over the top production that utilises stupid special effects and child actors with little to no discernable talent. All of the warmth and charisma of the original stars is missing in these cheap imitators. The plot is merely a string of gags ripped off from the original short films, none of which are funny. I suppose most people will only be interested in it today for the Donald Trump cameo. It's a good example of everything that was wrong with 1990s-era Hollywood comedy.",/review/rw2645481/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2004,Smells_Like_Cheese,5," It's cute
","This movie is a legend in my neighborhood. Because one of the kids from my old school in my grade was one of the bullies. So, my classroom had to watch this. We were all wondering what he had been up too. This is the most exciting thing ever to happened in my neighborhood. Sad, isn't it? The movie ""The Little Rascals"" is adorable. But it lacks somewhere. The kids are all brats. I don't think I was even able to really enjoy the cameos. But this is more of a kid's film. Not a movie you'd watch as a grown up. But congats to Zac, he made it... somewhat. And the movie is enjoyable if you are 7. Otherwise, you'd might want to skip it.",/review/rw2645481/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2011,TOMNEL,7," I hate films that try to be cute, but I don't hate this.
","Films and television shows that are trying to be cute to gain laughs can be quite irritating. They often rely on the audience gaining some sort of emotional investment out of seeing an adorable baby character, or young toddler, that says lines that no young kid would say, and the usual reaction is ""Aaawwww!"" (Full House did this for years). These types of cinema have no reason for existence, and usually try to serve as cheap entertainment that families can enjoy together. This movie is chalk full of little children doing things children would never do, no doubt with the director feeding them lines that they don't understand because they can't read yet. But, where this film is different is it's set up. The universe that these ""little rascals"" live in isn't the one we live in. It's some kind of parallel universe where children own their own cars and have very elaborate clubhouses, and where very young children go on romantic dates. And never once is this particularly corny. What could be a by the numbers movie turns out to be a sort of charming little movie that is fun and funny in a surreal way.",/review/rw2645481/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2000,Troy-24,," Horrible imitation of a classic series!
","Horrible! I grew up watching the classic original ""Our Gang"" comedies, which were genuinely funny and the kids were real and likeable.  This movie missed the boat completely.

","I gotta admit, for all the worth we put in actual filmic accomplishments, there's something undeniably pure about just liking something because you like it, the way a kid does. In that vein, there is 0 value in this movie; narratively, thematically, artistically, even humorously...that is, unless you're a kid...and maybe that's enough. It certainly was for me in 95, and I guess some of that Goodwill has stuck around for 25 years.",/review/rw2645481/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2019,mark.waltz,3," Some moments of cuteness can't hide the cringiness.
","When the minor characters of Porky and Buckwheat steal the few moments that they're on screen and leave the leading gang members of Spanky and Alfalfa to rip off what was done better 60 years before in ways that will make fans of the original series of shorts cringe. The great thing about the original series is that even when the kids were trying to act like adults, they didn't be anything but kids playacting and being silly. Here, their adult dialog is completely out of place, a fault of the script and not the majority of the cast. But each time that Froggy, Darla and Waldo are on hand, I cringed. Waldo's narcissism makes him instantly dislikable, an irony considering who plays his father in a completely unnecessary and hypocritical cameo.",/review/rw2645481/?ref_=tt_urv
