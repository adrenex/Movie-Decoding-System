6 October 2006,preppy-3,8," Unpleasant and disturbing...as it should be
","Prequel to the 2003 ""Texas Chainsaw..."" giving us the origin of Leatherface and his twisted family. That's all done within the first 20 minutes...then it's just a virtual redo on the original with four likable 20-somethings being captured and tortured by Leatherface and his family. Considering it's basically a remake of the 2003 film, it works remarkably well.",/review/rw1498902/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2006,mbworm,7," Wow
","Impresively taking ""Texas Chainsaw"" back to its roots, horror fans and cinema-goers alike should definitely give this prequel to the daring 2003 remake a chance. Although the remake in 2003 was excellent and had a tighter, more involving plot than this film, it breaks a barrier because rather than directly approaching the style of the remake and trying to live up to its success, this equally grisly thriller ignores all of the gloss, cinematography, pacing and story that it was inspired from. Instead, it goes back to the film style which made the nightmare in 1974, a more direct homage to the in your face horror that started it all.",/review/rw1498902/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2006,wes-115,8," Very Good...Full-On Chainsaw. Lots of gore. Very little cheese.
","The movie is very good...if you're into this kind of thing. It's nice to see a franchise splatter film that is intense and gory without being cheesy. Many of the current crop of splatter films are played intentionally cheesy for humor. Which is fine, but they shouldn't ALL be like that. This movie has some humor in it, but it's a darker humor, and not meant to be cheesy or campy.",/review/rw1498902/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2022,paul_haakonsen,6," Enjoyable slasher flick...
","""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning"" is actually a rather enjoyable addition to this particular slasher franchise. Especially when taking into consideration the abysmal ""Leatherface"" movie that came afterwards.",/review/rw1498902/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2006,zahana,7," Don't expect anything new
","Please don't get me wrong, this is a good horror film. To those looking for gore, it is there any there is plenty of blood shed. I would speculate several scenes have been cut to appease the mpaa. Had this film been release before Hostel, The Hills Have Eyes, or the Saw Franchise, more of the film would have ended up on the cutting room floor. The film is being advertised as it will show up how Tommy Hewitt became Leatherface. Anyone looking for any real discovery to this information will have to look somewhere else. Truthfully the only real incite into the Hewitt family origin is how a homicidal sexual deviant was able to become a Sheriff. Being a prequel, the lack of background information is, to say the least, disappointing. ",/review/rw1498902/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2006,ElijahCSkuggs,6," More Of The Same
","Story is about how the family became notorious for what they do best. That's killing young hippies, bikers and pretty much anyone else that crosses paths with them. And why? ""We'll never go hungry again."" Good enough reason for me! I, like many of you, are going to see this to see Leatherface and family, kill. To see gore, blood, maybe get a few scares, watch Leatherface do something really badass. Yeah! But is that all we're supposed to expect? Can't we hope for maybe something else thrown in? Maybe a real in-depth look into Leatherface aka Tommy. Nope, we get what I just said. The same old routine. We've seen it before. And it's been done better. Not with better special effects or cinematography. But acting, writing, and suspense. Not once was I scared, felt any type of suspense....anything. (I hope you did) I pretty much just sat there waiting for something ""cool"" to happen.",/review/rw1498902/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've been a Texas chainsaw fanatic since i saw the original (when i was about 8) and all the sequels obviously tried hard (except the one with Bridget Jones in which was an utter waste of time) but ultimately failed to be worthy of following up such a classic. the remake was OK, it looked great and had some quality violence but didn't really hit the spot.",/review/rw1498902/?ref_=tt_urv

","How did the characters become who they became?
This movie shows us how the Hewitt family began their reign of terror. The question I keep asking is this,,, who's the bigger 'main' monster? Is it Leatherface,, or the psychotic sheriff?!? While LF is definitely a monster,,, I'd say the Sheriff is the mastermind,,,
The 'kids' who find themselves in this living nightmare were cast perfectly,,,",/review/rw1498902/?ref_=tt_urv

",Texas Chainsaw Massacre:The Beginning is a fantastic slasher film that brings us back to the classic era of 1970's slashers.I loved this chainsaw film simply because it answers all the whys and provides you with leatherface's history.Definitely gorier than the previous film and far more cringe inducing.This is first non cheesy slasher i've seen in ages which is a very nice change for me personally.,/review/rw1498902/?ref_=tt_urv

","There is an idiom about the way a human being feels painwhen a surge comes, it makes a brief period of time, sometimes only a matter of seconds, feel like an unbearable eternity.

13 October 2006,drownsoda90,9," This Is What The Remake Should Have Been.
","I went in seeing ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning"" with pretty high expectations, and this movie delivered on all levels. The film begins at an old meat factory where a deformed baby is born from one of the workers back in 1939 Texas. Cut to 1969, the old meat plant is shutting down and the town is becoming abandoned, and the baby born thirty years ago, Thomas Hewitt (aka - Leatherface) isn't too happy about the factory's closing, and neither is his family. We are then introduced to some young adults who are driving through Texas on one last road trip before the two men have to head back to Vietnam, leaving their girlfriends behind. The kids crash their car into a cow when being harassed by a biker, and all but one are picked up by Sheriff Hoyt (R. Lee Ermey), who has taken the job of town sheriff upon himself. From there, the kids are tortured and find themselves in a struggle to save themselves from the now-cannibalistic family.",/review/rw1498902/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2007,claudio_carvalho,8," The Ugliest Thing Ever Seen
","In August, 1939, a worker has an abortion while working in a slaughterhouse and dies. The deformed baby is dumped in a garbage container and found by a beggar later, who brings him home. Along the years, the freak creature called Thomas is raised by the Hewitt family in spite of having psychological problems, working in a meat plant. In July, 1969, when the facility is closed, the inhabitants move to other places, but the deformed insane Thomas kills the foreman. His deranged stepfather executes the sheriff that is going to arrest Thomas, and assumes his identity, wearing his clothes, driving his car though the roads in Texas and entitling himself as Sheriff Hoyt (R. Lee Ermey). Meanwhile, the brothers Eric (Matt Bomer) and Dean (Taylor Handley) are traveling in a Jeep with their girlfriends Christie (Jordana Brewster) and Bailey (Diora Baird), Eric to serve in Vietnam and Dean escaping to Mexico. When the group has a car accident, Hoyt arrests Eric, Dean and Bailey and brings them to his house. Christie follows them trying to rescue the trio, trapped in the house of sadistic and insane cannibals, in a trip of horror and gore.",/review/rw1498902/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2006,jed-estes,10," The Saw is back
","I would like it be stated first that I really hated the last two Texas Chainsaw movies. Those being the remake and Next Generation. This one however being a prequel to the remake had a raw intensity that I had not seen in years and I loved it. I still like the first three chainsaws better but this was a step up to the old days. R. Lee Ermy brought something new to his performance in this that I felt was vastly lacking in his first attempt and that was a caring of the series. It seemed like the role fit him more in this. Andrew Byrinasli or however you spell it, is cool now because he is the first person ever to play Leatherface twice now, go Andrew. Go see this movie it is cool.",/review/rw1498902/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2006,andell,1," The Beginning? Are you kidding?
","There are a lot of things that astonish and disappoint me in this world...but this ridiculous piece of garbage film getting a 5.9 rating on the back of a LOT of perfect ratings is one of the most disappointing and disturbing of all. In fact, I dare say when I was leaving the theater, the only crime I felt had taken place was fraud! The cast is essentially the same...two girls (one brunette and one blonde) and two boys (one brunette and one blonde) are substituted for the ""original"" two girls and two boys with the same hair color and the same general appearance. Insert a couple of bikers, some inane ""facts"" about how ""Hoyt"" became sheriff, ""Leatherface"" was born and raised, and so on...and what you have is the original remake remade with a B class feel.",/review/rw1498902/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2011,ricky_may1,10," The Best Chainsaw film of all!!!
","To start off let me say i think this film was WAY better than the remake in 2003. It had more intense moments and it was like 20 times more scary. I liked R. Lee Ermy in the remake but LOVED him here!! he takes what originally was a two bit player and makes him into a more educated and cultured leader of the clan. This helps make the film move more smoothly and plus adds more depth to the character (especially during his speech about having to resort to cannibalism in Korea.) the cinematography is dark and gritty and the sense of dread is overwhelming especially when the kids are captured by ""sheriff"" Hoyt. Leatherface is more badass here than in the remake as well the whole intense death of the biker is one of the greatest deaths in cinematic history.",/review/rw1498902/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2006,Esken,," Welcome to Texas!
","I saw this when i was in L.A. screening my own horror short October 2006. It was at the Chinese theater, and i was so delighted that i'm still talking about it. I love the original and the remake, and i feel the same way with this one. It shows how f****d up things can get when you accidentally end up in places you shouldn't be. Ermey is a true horror star, and really shows of here. This is a very gory film, and those of you who can't watch much blood, stay away:) For those of you who can, come on in!!! :) When i watched it i almost felt that it might turn me off of making horror films, but the feeling of course came right back:) Leatherface shows no mercy! Just as us horror freaks like it. The thing that shocked me was that i heard that they cut 17 scenes to get it an R-rating? Then i'm thinking, i can't wait to see what they cut. Hopefully the DVD will show us the goods. This might sound dumb coming from a horror fan of a long time, but i hope they make another one:)",/review/rw1498902/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2006,BloodStone,8," A very noteworthy installment to the series.
","* MAY CONTAIN SOME MINOR SPOILERS* Well kiddies, just got back from taking in an afternoon matinée of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre; The Beginning"" & I got 4 words that best describe it: BRUTAL,GRUESOME and INTENSE! The film is gorier & more unrelenting than its predecessor from 2003. And actually we learn almost from the start, that Leatherface isn't the antagonist who got the whole grisly ball of wax rolling, it was his Uncle-the Sheriff wannabe (played of course by Lee Remey). We are shown the would-be mother of Thomas Hewitt (aka Leatherface) giving birth to the deformed child right on the floor of the slaughterhouse where she works. She abandons (well, we are led to believe it was her) said child in the dumpster behind the slaughterhouse where he is subsequently discovered by a hobo woman & taken to his permanent place of residence. From there, we are shown snapshot glimpses of his early childhood (I use this next term very loosely) ""development."" Fast forward to 1969, where little Tommy is now 30 years old, face covered virtually all the time with a dingy blue scarf, and of course he is employed at the local slaughterhouse where he's referred to in usually hush tones as ""retard"". All is ""well"" until the day when the place is shut down by the Texas Board of Health for obvious & serious health code violations. The little town down in Texas is now a ghostville USA because of the plant closing and the only inhabitants left are the deranged Hewitt clan (sounds just like Michigan under Governor Granholm-LOL). During the remainder of the film we see how dear old Uncle transforms little Tommy from a mere butcher of dead animals, into the chainsaw wielding maniac we've all come to know & love so well. And as a pleasant bonus, we also are given glimpses into why the ""Sheriff"" is such a twisted wacko. TCM for what it lacks in suspense, it more than makes up for with gruesome deaths, intensity, some gore & sheer madness. Wait till you see how the old dude in the wheelchair (from TCM 03) gets in that exact condition (both shocking & hilarious). Some of the scenes do mirror those from the original (dinner table scene from TCM 74) & others from TCM 03. So yes, a little of TCM the Beginning will feel like 'old hat' but then again we're not talking Shakesphere here. I also think many will be surprised at the ending of this film. Is ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre; The Beginning"" as good as TCM 74?-NO! But it does offer one thing I wish the original 74 version had done. We find out exactly why, the family are cannibals & it has nothing to do with having the best bar-b-que either. This film is a good (not great)installment in the series. My only real complaint outside of the lack of suspense, is that we are never really shown Leatherface's mug. I can't decide if that is a good thing or not or intentional on the directors part to perhaps keep the mysterious aura of Leatherface intact. Side note: I do hope this is the last of the TCM films because I feel there is nothing left of interest to do with this franchise that we haven't already seen.",/review/rw1498902/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2006,Joshbond,10," I like this face better
","This movie started off like any other horror flick. Especially a Texas chainsaw massacre flick but this movie answers so many questions from the first one and really makes it look like this movie should come first. The blood effects are amazing and the storyline was fresh and overall the movie was amazing! It took a little getting used to because although it was a lot like the first one it was very different. I won't spoil it for ya but this one makes the first one look like a Teletubbies Christmas Special!

7 October 2006,fertilecelluloid,8," The most brutal of all ""Chainsaw"" movies
","Easily the most brutal of all the ""Chainsaw"" films, this prequel to the original remake, not the 70's original, is close to ninety minutes of non-stop violence and mayhem, which is a recommendation...sort of. Although it's supposed to be about ""the beginning"" of the chainsaw clan, it fails to adequately expand on the origins of Leatherface and his ""family"". We get about ten minutes of backstory (they closed the local slaughterhouse, so old Leatherface got mad and took a sledge to the boss) before we're into another tale of teenagers driving across Texas who end up dangling from hooks. The US ""R"" rating is mighty lenient because the material here would certainly have been NC-17/X-rated at any other time.",/review/rw1498902/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 2006,dtoonotblaidke,10," beats the remake to death...literally!
","I loved this movie in all of it's brutal, insane glory! From beginning to end, the movie was far more intense and scary than the remake. Now, don't get me wrong, I loved the remake. I honestly didn't think that this movie would be that good though. I mean, the remake kind of started a new genre of horror (whether people liked it or not). BUT 'The Beginning' basically beats the remake to death...literally! While the 2003 Texas Chainsaw had some bloody parts and was very in your face, the new one doesn't shy away from ANYTHING! i mean, IMDb says that 17 scenes were edited to get an R...I still have NO idea how this movie got an R rating. Every death is basically by chainsaw, with blood, guts and screaming galore. My friend, who I saw 'The beginning' with last night HTED and i mean HATED the 2003 remake. She laughed her head off. This one left her speechless. This movie reminds us what true horror REALLY is! The directing is amazing, the acting, music and scares are incredible and Leatherface is basically my new favorite horror villain, hands down. Did you enjoy the remake? You'll LOVE this movie! I gave it a 10. It's good to see Hollywood at least trying to give us some decent scary movies.",/review/rw1498902/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2007,mentalcritic,1," And they kept telling us the deaths of small studios was no cause for concern...
","If there is one thing that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, to quote the full title, tells me, it is this. Ideas are dead in American film-making. Especially in American horror film-making, a genre that tried every ridiculous and bizarre idea it could muster when I was growing up during the 1980s. Sure, there were copycats and also-rans, but as the major studios become more and more obsessed with remaking old glories, it is hard not to mourn the deaths of smaller operators such as Cannon or Orion. Those who wish to defend this abortion of a horror film by telling me I am talking out of my butt would be advised to check out such classics as The Hidden or Remote Control. I shant kid you that these B-flicks were the cinematic equivalent of beluga caviar, but compared to the mass-produced, McDonald's flavour of The Beginning, they may as well have been. What makes The Beginning even more bland is that in contrast to Kim Henkel's admittedly atrocious sequels, there is nothing to distinguish The Beginning from the remake or any of the originals.",/review/rw1498902/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2006,errolforprez,1," Pointless and Insulting
","This movie was gore merely for the sake of gore. There was zero suspense knowing that all of the characters would die. The problem I've always had with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies is this idea that the state police never seem to come knocking after these gruesome deaths occur and the victims go missing. It's a kind of oh well we'll just overlook that one glaring plot hole, but unfortunately it's a big one and just too big to ignore. This Chainsaw film just seemed utterly pointless based on that fact and completely insulting to average intelligence. At least in the 2003 film, the main character, Jessica Biel, manages to escape. Every single character is so one dimensional and disposable that I didn't feel anything for the characters. What I did feel was sympathy for the actors playing these meaningless parts. I just sat there waiting for the next one to die and other than being mildly curious about what kind of morbid way they would be offed, I was far from being on the edge of my seat. The first act of the film is by far made the least amount of sense and just seemed like filler to get to the gory stuff and chainsaw scenes. The subplot with the bikers made zero sense. There is absolutely no explanation why the biker chick just suddenly starts pursuing the jeep out of nowhere to rob it. Uh where was her boyfriend and what was he doing? At least in the 2003 film, there were a lot better struggles and chase sequences and at least the setup made more sense. This film's ending was by far the biggest slap in the face of the horror genre. After sitting through 91 minutes of grotesque, sadistic torture the one single remaining character is killed in the most clichéd ways imaginable. This movie deserves to be banned - banned for being stupid beyond belief.",/review/rw1498902/?ref_=tt_urv
