3 October 2008,dee.reid,7," Strange blend of sci-fi/horror/fantasy entertainment
","Just to get this out of the way, ""Sanctuary"" is one of the best-looking shows on television; the strange, unique blend of science fiction, horror, and fantasy really add to the overall strangeness and beauty of the lush CGI, comic book-style visuals. In fact, ""Sanctuary"" does seem like a weird, live-action hybrid combining elements of horror and sci-fi comics, plus, as a few other viewers mentioned, ""The X-Files"" and ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"" and maybe even the ""Underworld"" films.",/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2007,white431,8," Not Bad - Gothic X-Files meets Buffy?
",Interesting way to release this new series - webisodes every couple of weeks that are about 15 minutes long. Put them all together and you potentially have a pilot of just over two hours.,/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2012,nmicro,6," It gets better the more you watch
","I too am a Stargate buff & like Amanda Tapping. It is my opinion that the show is worth the watch. On watching the first episode I liked what I saw, then after a few I didn't so much. However, my son had continued to watch it & told me not to give up on it just yet. So I went back to it & got pleasantly surprised. Some episodes were as good as full length movies. I particularly liked Jonathon young's character, Nikola Tesla:) Amanda played an extremely believable lady from England & I thought her accent was just great. It was a complete transformation from Samantha Carter of SG1. This character was a more domineering in control person who knew what she wanted and how to get it. The settings & special effects were pretty darn good I thought. It seemed a fair amount of thought and time went into these areas. Like all TV shows there is going to be an episode or three that doesn't appeal or seems to loose focus to the individual. However, overall I felt good about watching the show.",/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv

",Full disclosure: I pretty much love everything about Amanda Tapping. So it's not a big surprise that I love this series so much.,/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2020,Easygoer10,8," Groundbreaking In Some Ways
","As a ""Stargate: SG1"" fan, I was intrigued by this series (of course). After all, anyone who respects Amanda Tapping had to be. As mentioned in the Trivia section, this was the very first TV series in which Red One digital cameras were used. For the era, they were the highest resolution cameras which wete also small. This combination led to dozens of films and TV series using them. In the following years, they have progressed enormously, which is typical when dealing with most computer hardware (which these were). Basically, they became more powerful juxtaposed with a smaller camera. No need for film and emulsion when a chip can be used instead. Please excuse the digression. Besides the SyFy channel, it was immediately available on the Internet. Ms. Tapping along with several key crew members from ""Stargate SG1 and it's spinoff series joined her. Some of the actors as well. I really liked this show. Ironically, when you watch today, it appears almost like ""Pre-vis"" video used to make feature films. Regardless, this is a unique show. You must excuse the overzealous antagonists. It is an original idea which Ms. Tapping spawned into a wonderful show. I bought all 4 seasons when it became available on Amazon Video. I watch it occasionally, and I always like it. A must see for all fans of the ""Stargate"" series and science fiction, in general.",/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2009,pontram,," Good Actors, entertaining show
","I found the first few episodes a bit silly, and watched them only for good ol' Amanda Tapping, because I wanted to see how she's doing after the deep hole of Stargate cancellation, after I saw her a few seconds in Stargate Universe.",/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2009,axe_pagode,8," Canadian TV is on a roll. Sanctuary is a breath of fresh air.
","Sanctuary is a fun show to watch. Amanda Tapping and crew do a fine job of telling interesting stories. Many of the story lines came straight from the webisodes. However, the topics were highly compelling, the acting wonderful; especially with all the green screens, and the production may be the wave of the future for most TV series.",/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2009,cidade_negra,8," Great Show! Fantastic Acting! Cool Story lines.
",What else can a Sci Fi fan ask for? This show has the potential to be one of the best original shows on SciFi channel. I can't wait for the new episodes to start.,/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2008,limona_razvan,6," Good start, then bump !
","Sanctuary had a good premise to make it different. Unfortunately, step by step, ideas including Jack the Ripper, Merlin, immortality etc. got in and mess the show. Why choose old, reused for a hundred time stories, despite the show target - subspecies of humans ? In the same time the house look more like a prison to me, a combination of 1870 Â„HIGH TECH"" with nowadays technology. The good doctor and his daughter use bullets and guns as main weapons against enemies who attack one by one (?), except some scenes design to show their prowess in hand to hand combat. The scenery is a obviously hint to doctor Frankestein novel, but they put a lot of work in making the environment believable. Still, there is no info about the subspecies living conditions, cause of mutations, personalities, etc. The man with two heads, the lizard or the mermaid are just background to the main cast. Make them count !",/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2008,Roundcat,3," Full of holes...
","I won't harp on too much but the scripting needs a lot of work to make this stand the tests of time. There are annoying sequences where a DEADLY boss ""who will kill them all"" talks at length at gun point...when, really, our hero should of just of pulled the trigger and been done with him. What this does is contradict the premise of the show - that these are a group of hotshot experts catching monsters and that they know how to deal with them. US obsession with the English accent also does this no favours as it makes it a little to much of a production island, when we in the UK for example just see it as bland US air-filler.",/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv

25 October 2008,alr126,7," Almost great
","I cannot seem to figure out what this show is missing. It has a great cast, Amanda Tapping at her best. The premise of the show....excellent, offer sanctuary to those that might be ""different"" than the ""normal"" humans. the storyline is great....",/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2010,merrywood,6," We look for further development
","This show is worth watching. However, it seems to struggle to locate itself and this is always due to the strength of script. The show badly needs good writers who can bring depth to it and lift it out of the B-film category. The best shows we've ever seen are memorable because they tell us something about life and about ourselves. At this juncture this show is like munching on popcorn...not really good enough to endure. Canadian production can do better. The best thing they've done thus far is introduce Agam Darshi to the cast. She picks up the show's energy by a good number of points. Still, we need to see better scripts. As for Nikola Tesla being a vampire...this is bizarre and not terribly bright. It makes as much sense as introducing Ghandi as a zombie. Tesla remains one of the great unsung heroes of modern technology. Please do some thinking before you commit a script to production.",/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2009,scottmannen1,8," Great show, potential to be even greater!
","I am giving this an 8 out of 10, I wanted 7.5 but I think the show has the potential to get even better in coming seasons if they play it right. As long as the show continues to get darker and the plots stay interesting we are looking at a great new series! The one character that hurts the show in my opinion is the daughter. She is a pretty face to look at but I find her acting is dull, and not interesting. If they were to replace her with someone more interesting...perhaps someone like a Kristen Kreuk we would be set! I also think that the protagonist does a great job of acting and I think that her transition from Stargate to this show was a good one. Her accent definitely needs some work. Either get rid of the English accent altogether, or get much better at it!",/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2008,story321,6," Nice concept, but technical aspects could be better
","This show hearkens back to a few of the shows from the 90s like ""Poltergeist: The Legacy"" and even the first six seasons of ""The X-Files"".",/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2011,whotobe,9," Very Entertaining!
","When this program was first released, I was put off in the previews by Amanda Tapping with a British accent, so I skipped watching it. She may have been born in the UK, but her American accent seems to pop out at times. However, I decided that after three seasons on the air, I would watch the program. I was not disappointed. The story is a very interesting look at the Sanctuary that Dr. Helen Magnus operates to protect ""Abnormal"" beings.",/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2008,coolchange666,4," Good characters, premise and atmosphere but BAD writing
",I've just finished watching the 2 episode pilot for the TV series of Sanctuary. I really wanted to like Sanctuary. a good premise and a reliable actress well able to carry off the lead role. Even the supporting cast are good.. and the atmosphere was great. Yes I Had high hopes. As a fan of sci-fi and fantasy over many years I am familiar with the suspension of disbelief required to immerse one's self into a created universe. Unfortunately the writing left me wondering exactly how much disbelief I was expected to suspend. The show is marketed for all ages but is so simple in its execution that its prime audience must be young adults. ,/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2009,choda1977,4," Sanctuary - Interesting Concept but with Poor Execution
","Being a long time fan of the Stargate Series, I was intrigued when I heard Amanda Tapping would be starring in a new sci fi show. The concept sounded interesting...A Sanctuary for all manners of creatures unknown to science, some based in myth, some just plain odd! A team that attempts to locate these creatures and in a way, rescue them and give them a chance to live in this Sanctuary.",/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2021,vikte-sn,5," Lost interest
","Watched a season and a half and realized I don't feel like continuing. It's not that bad, but it just doesn't hold my attention. The fantasy aspect of it is quite weak, but that's not the biggest issue. The biggest issue is that I really don't care about any of the characters, they seem quite cliche and don't resonate with me at all.",/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2007,siderite,5," ClichÃ© piece of wrap
","I've heard that some of the people in Stargate and some other sci fi shows were playing in this new concept series, completely web based, where you have to pay to see an episode. It also boasted no sets, everything done on green screen. I said ""Cool! No distribution companies, no production companies, this will be a show as good as the mind can think"". Tiiit! Wrong.",/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2010,IComp,10," Absolutely love the show! Two thumbs up!
","Absolutely love the show! Two thumbs up! Sanctuary and Warehouse 13 have now taken the place of Stargate SG1 and Atlantis for me, although Stargate Universe has been getting way better in Season 2. Obviously the heart of what made Stargate SG1 so popular moved through Atlantis and continued on to Sanctuary! Thanks Damian, Amanda,and Marty!!! I like Dunne & Robbins. Heyerdahl is exceptional! Agam Darshi - nice addition ..... More Druit, Wingfield and Young please - These guys rock! Goa'uld beget Wraithe beget Abnormals - OK,VERY COOL! Keep the DeLouise boys in the loop and maybe throw in some RickyD, a little Chris Judge and of course Michael Shanks as periodic guests and you have the IT factor that made Stargate in the first place - the main cast, producers, and writers! Would be nice to see Simon and Williams back in the gang as well! I do believe that Apophis and Baal would make superb Abnormals! Keep up the good work guys - This is great! KUDOS! Amanda,and Marty!!!",/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv

19 May 2008,cmlynchaz,10," Love it!
","OK... so in reality I've only watched the first 4 episodes but... I really like getting to see Amanda Tapping as another character. It's great to see... don't get me wrong, I love Samantha Carter but still. Also, I think it's neat to see Amanda bringing together her enjoyment of science and her love of acting. All that being said, I really like the premise of the show over all. Its intriguing and entertaining. I'm looking forward to seeing what other 'abnormals' are created for this series. From what I've seen so far this looks to be a very creative and imaginative show. I can't wait to see more!",/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2009,joshi_3592,8," Original idea, a few minor mistakes, but definitely a show worth watching.
","It seems Canadian TV shows are at it's golden age, to be honest only reason i decided to check Sanctuary out is because of Amanda Tapping. Being a big fan of Stargate SG-1 (also Canadian by the way) starring Tapping as one of the main cast, I heard of this show through a Stargate convention and figured it would be worth watching, and having just finished the pilot movie I think it is.",/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv

","No this has nothing to do with Harry Potter, I just thought the title would be a great summation of the show. Which I think is fair to say. And it also tells you what to expect here. And while it felt that the show started off slow (which makes sense with all the introductions), it does take off a bit.",/review/rw5661296/?ref_=tt_urv
