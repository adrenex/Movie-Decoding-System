18 November 2010,claudio_carvalho,7," True Love does not Have Expiration Date
","In New York, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is the efficient event checker of The New Yorker and her fiancé Victor (Gael García Bernal) is an enthusiastic chef that is opening an Italian restaurant of his own. They decide to have a pre-honeymoon traveling to Verona, where Victor will visit his suppliers. Once in Italy, Victor does not give much attention to Sophie, spending his time with the meetings. When he decides to travel to Livorno, Sophie prefers to stay in Verona to sightsee the historical places. She visits the house of Juliet, where tourists leave love letters and she finds a group of women called ""secretaries of Juliet"" that reply the letters. She joins the group and finds an unanswered letter from 1957 from a British woman named Claire Smith (Vanessa Redgrave) hidden behind a brick and she decides to reply the letter. A couple of days later, the snobbish and skeptic prig Charlie (Christopher Egan) visits the secretaries of Juliet and Sophie leans that he is the grandson of the widow Claire that has just come to Verona to seek out Lorenzo Bartolini after receiving the letter written by Sophie. She meets the old lady and they decide to search her former love together. There are seventy-four Lorenzo Bartolini in Italy, but true love does not have expiration date. Meanwhile the estranged relationship between Sophie and Charlie changes.",/review/rw2311166/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2010,bjones,8," Unexpectedly good
","I had expectations of seeing a nominal quality love story going in. I was pleasantly surprised that this film was a noticeable cut above the average. I enjoyed it a great deal; and judging from the audience, so did everyone else.",/review/rw2311166/?ref_=tt_urv

","Aspiring writer Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) and her fiancé go to Verona for a pre-wedding/business trip, but he's obsessed with work and leaves poor Sophie to sightsee alone.

21 May 2010,inkblot11,8," Let yourself play hooky from housework and go see Letters, it's so enjoyable
","Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is a fact checker for New Yorker magazine, although she longs to be a bonafide journalist. Her boss (Oliver Platt) knows she does a great job in her present position but has no clue concerning her writing aspirations. Lucky gal, she is also engaged to a very handsome chef (Gael Garcia Bernal) and they are about to embark on a journey to Verona, Italy. But, how genuine is her luck, really? Her fiancé rarely devotes his full attention to what she is saying or wishing, being utterly wrapped up in the new restaurant he is about to open. Even the trip abroad, a supposed ""pre-honeymoon"" gets sidetracked when future hubby only wants to go to wine auctions and such. No sightseeing, which is what Sophie is keen to do. Therefore, she lets her mate go off on his own, while she looks over Verona, especially the ""Juliet Wall"", where folks leave letters to Juliet for advice on love. Sophie discovers that a team of older ladies compose the return letters and they let her help, one day. It is then that Sophie finds a letter tucked behind a loose brick. What a find! As it turns out, it was written by a young lady named Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) fifty years ago. She wanted to know if she should follow her heart and become attached to an Italian named Lorenzo (Franco Nero) or should she go home to England. Sadly, no one found the letter and Claire returned to Britain. Now, Sophie writes a reply to see what occurs. Ho, ho, ho! Claire and her grandson, Charlie (Christopher Egan) are in Verona in a matter of a few days, with Charlie giving Sophie a tongue-lashing for upsetting his grandmother's life. Instant dislike reigns. But, given the fact that fiancé is still on the run, this new trio, Claire, Sophie and Charlie, begin a search through the surrounding countryside for Lorenzo. Will they find him? And, will Sophie and Charlie stop fighting long enough to gaze into each other's eyes? I say go see this beautifully made film soon. The cast is wonderful, with Seyfried and Egan making a talented and good-looking pair, and the lesser cast members doing nice work as well. Redgrave is very touching as the older lady looking backwards and Nero, well, not only is he charming, he still looks most handsome! The scenery, naturally, is dazzling and so are the costumes and cinematography. The script has some originality, as well as predictable events, and the direction, though slow at times, seems secure. In short, let yourself off the hook from more mundane tasks and trot off to the cinema for this little gem, romance fans.",/review/rw2311166/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2010,ltoner1,9," Absolutely delightful film!
","I saw this film at an early screening and couldn't have been more delighted. The film is charming, adorable, and sweet with many laughs to be had as well. The message of romantic love being timeless and one that can cross many generations was very well appreciated and felt. The scenery of Italy in the film is gorgeous. There are breathtaking shots that make you want to hop on a plane after the film is over and go there yourself.",/review/rw2311166/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2010,bassrourke,7," Wonderful Juliet
","What a surprise this beautiful and easy going film was. Letters to Juliet is a nice afternoon at the cinema, while doubling as a postcard from Italy. Amanda Seyfried is on a roll, her lovely awareness of roles will propel her into super stardom. As young Sophie, who is engaged to a over zealous chef, her life is changed dramatically when she finds an ancient letter buried in a sacred site in Verona. The home of star-crossed lover Juliet provides serious love aspirations for all who visit. Sophie, a fact checker but would be journalist pursues the writer of the letter, Vanessa Redgrave, then takes off on a road-trip with her grandson in tow to find the lost recipient. The film is lush, sensual on the eyes but light enough to just relax & enjoy. Vanessa Redgrave sparkles and reminded me of Miss Daisy at times. Amanda Seyfried delivers pure delight, her saucer wide eyes had me transfixed. Wonderful.",/review/rw2311166/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2010,Dragoneyed363,8," It's surprisingly a really cute and charming, lovable movie
","I have to admit, I was very impressed and surprised with how great Letters to Juliet ended up being and how much I enjoyed it. I was very entertained throughout the entire film with it's interesting story plot and likable characters. Amanda Seyfried plays as a sweet, young, engaged woman named Sophie who finds a note written over 50 years ago by Claire, portrayed by the amazing Vanessa Redgrave, who talks of her one true love Lorenzo, and Sophie replies.",/review/rw2311166/?ref_=tt_urv

12 July 2010,chaaa,2," Ugggghhhh!
","The problem with gratuitously romantic films is that they often tend to alienate those audience members who have a lick of common sense!

23 May 2010,TVfan,8," Coulda been a classic, but
","Really enjoyed this film. A very good story, that had many good moments, one in particular -- if you've seen the film, you know which one I'm talking about. Redgrave made this film. She is amazing, and she gave the story believability. But the film could have been a classic. Two things got in the way. 1) The story was just a little too light, seems like they were trying too hard to make a romantic comedy, instead of letting it be what it was -- probably the money people were responsibly for that one. 2) The two leads were somewhat unlikable, with zero chemistry. She was OK, but he was a Hugh Grant caricature. The pacing of their relationship was way too fast to be believable. I think this story is good enough to be remade, and I think it should be - with a different Sophie and a different Charlie, and maybe a little (please note I said a ""little"") more serious tone. Other than Sophie and Charlie, I think the film was very well cast.",/review/rw2311166/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2010,neil-476,8," That Miss Redgrave is jolly good, isn't she?

9 May 2010,mailmrsraj,9," A beautiful romantic movie..
","Every minute of the film, you know what will happen next. But pathetically and desperately, you will wait. And you want to see it. I wonder, how a romantic heart can understand, wait and cry for that one kiss and one hold of the hand...Tears came and I couldn't stop them. Watched movie with a dancing heart and heavy emotions... It's just another good movie. If you think I said less judge it yourself. You will see it again to feel that wonderful feeling of being alive... If you have such a great heart... I say you must watch. I ended up loving the story. And watched all the women write to Juliet in belief. Call it Santa or Juliet. They know a true feeling finds it way. They ask for it, they wait all their lives just to hear its OK to love. And I want to write letters to those who believe in Juliet.",/review/rw2311166/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2010,saadgkhan,7," Breathtaking locations and sparkling chemistry between Amanda Seyfried and Christopher Egan
","LETTERS TO JULIET – CATCH IT ( B+ ) Letters to Juliet is a very simple and pure love story. This is a story about Amanda Seyfried who while vacationing in Italy finds an unanswered letter to Juliet and she story begins when she answers the letter. After few days a guy and his grandmother shows up to see who wrote the letter. After that the journey for the lost love (Lorenzo) through beautiful locations of Italy starts. The movie starts off normal but the moment Vanessa Redgrave enters the screen along with her grandson Christopher Egan, the movie picks up. The movie is full of simple and innocent moments with breathtaking locations of Italy, watching the stunning locations will leave you in Awe and desire to visit Italy immediately. Amanda Seyfried looks gorgeous as always and her chemistry is very enchanting with Christopher Egan. Though, her chemistry with Goal Garcia Bernal is very flat may be it also required for the script. Christopher Egan is one hell of sexy and adorable Aussi Lad though in the movie he plays British. His charming personality and chemistry with Amanda Seyfried is worth watching. Goal Garcia Bernal was OK. Vanessa Redgrave is truly elegant and graceful in this age. Franco Nero suited really well as the ultimate Lorenzo of Vanessa Redgrave. By the way Vanessa Redgrave and Franco Nero are couple in real life as well, isn't that amazing. Taylor Swift's song ""Love Story"" was a perfect fit for the movie. Oh I love the ending in the famous Romeo & Juliet balcony style, it looks simply adorable. Overall Letters to Juliet purity, simple story and breathtaking locations makes it really memorable and enjoyable.",/review/rw2311166/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2013,BobbySandhu-01,2," Wooden Acting + Predictable Plot + Failed Humor
","They've tried to make it a classic location based romantic film for teenager girls, but while doing so they've tried to target the mature audience as well with half-attempted tongue in cheek dialogs. For me, this has failed miserably as the whole Brit Vs Americano recipe really doesn't work in this pan. ",/review/rw2311166/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm as much a fan of chick flicks as the next person but this is a chick flick I am not a fan of. Sophie is an American magazine fact checker and aspiring writer on a ""pre-honeymoon"" with her fiancé in Italy. She comes across a courtyard in Verona where women from all over the world are coming to leave letters for Juliet, Shakespeare's Juliet. After following a woman gathering all the letters at the end of the day Sophie finds out that a small group of women personally answer each letter. They call themselves, ""Juliet's secretaries"".

11 June 2010,hopek-1,2," Luscious Italy, shame about the film
","I did not go to this film with very high expectations, but discovered that, as low as they were, my expectations were still too high. Italy is a beautiful backdrop for a load of tosh. The acting was wooden and totally implausible. However, it may be that no-one could have made much of the plot and script. It looked as if someone had managed to secure Vanessa Redgrave and then set about finding a suitable vehicle for her. I have seen this actress over the years on film and the stage and found her to be exciting and intelligent in her performances. This was a total waste of her talent. There are far too many films coming out and more is definitely less as this shows.",/review/rw2311166/?ref_=tt_urv

18 May 2010,jon.h.ochiai,9," The Courage to Find True Love
","Vanessa Redgrave is awesome in ""Letters to Juliet"". She rocks. She plays Claire, who in her own words is sorry for being a ""such a coward"" for not following her heart, and being with her true love Lorenzo—over 50 years ago in Tuscany. Her performance is literally in her steel blue eyes—it is just who she is being—no conscience acting here. I think Redgrave gets a nomination in this very charming, heartfelt, and predictable romantic comedy. She embodies the kind of emotional gravitas and humanity that John Gielgud did in ""Arthur"". Beautiful and spirited Amanda Seyfried plays Sophie ""The New Yorker"" fact checker and wannabe writer, who accompanies Claire and her grandson Charlie (wonderfully played by Christopher Egan) to find her lost love in Tuscany.",/review/rw2311166/?ref_=tt_urv
