22 February 2020,Alexander_Blanchett,7," Johnny Depp is great in this very important film
","A solid and important film, especially these days with very recent topics. Its a story that deserved to be told at the cinema as it is groundbreaking, shocking and absolutely relevant. It also brings back Johnny Depp to his actually acting standards. Depp is wonderful, and not only because he successfully de-glammed for the role, but also because he found his acting weapons back. He truly gives a great performance in a film that sometimes suffers from its lengths. Because although the story is absolutely important to tell, director Andrew Levitas didn't really do where to go with it. He knew he wanted to tell it, he knew what he wanted to tell, but he didn't know how to put this in a 2 hours movie as there are some major lengths , especially in the midsection of the film And you sometimes had the impression this wold have worked better as a short film. To see Depp back to business it is worth to see and also to encounter newcomer Minami in the female lead is really something. She did great and shared a great chemistry with Johnny Depp. Bill Nighy also has his moments but can do better, his role was a bit underdeveloped. The song is amazing and there are many moments that are worth to mention, however as a whole it felt sometimes a bit too slow and without a definite direction.",/review/rw8146227/?ref_=tt_urv

10 April 2022,goshamorrell,10," Depp's best film yet
","""Minamata"" showcases its desire to be an important movie in almost every frame. It tries to be a character study, a commentary on the power of photojournalism, and a study in how the large profit margins of major corporations can attract those without moral compasses. Sadly, it too often misses the first of those three narratives by underlining and emphasizing the second pair, and character is really the most important thing about films like this. A ""message movie"" only works because of the characters who convey it. We admire films like ""Spotlight"" and ""Dark Waters"" not solely because of the true stories they unveil but because of how those messages are embedded in character dramas. Leading man Johnny Depp is up to the challenge, and he gives a finely tuned performance here that kind of feels like his first ""old man"" turn, and he's matched by a charming piece of work from Minami, but ""Minamata"" is weighed down by self-important direction that loses the human beings in this story by prioritizing the headlines. The problems come when Levitas tries to translate that passion into interesting drama. He hired great people in terms of craft, working with the great Beno√Æt Delhomme (""At Eternity's Gate"") to give the entire production a charged visual acumen. And the legendary Ryuichi Sakamato provides a lovely score. But these master craftsmen almost enable Levitas' fatal flaw, one that really lands with a final photo montage of disasters like Minamata from around the world, making it clear how much the producers here feel like they've made a definitive film instead of just a heartfelt one. A film like ""Minamata"" doesn't need to tell every story like it, look perfect, or have a mesmerizing score. It needs to be a little edgy and gritty and human to feel true. Otherwise, it feels like something we look at through a lens, something we observe and admire but can never get our hands on to truly feel.",/review/rw8146227/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2021,anthonyjlangford,9," Depp a Star
","Johnny Depp has what many actors don't. Even the current so called top tier ones. Charisma. Star power. Whatever that x factor is, he has it. And has done for 35 years. The fact that he has been cancelled by the Hollywood feminist/woke brigade is a disgrace. He has not been found guilty of anything. He initiated a defamation case that was not successful. The only person admitting to DV in a recording was that horrid entity he was with. Her career goes on and she can barely act. This man is a star. It's simply sexist hypocrisy. Put him back on the screen where he belongs.",/review/rw8146227/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2021,frank-liesenborgs,9," Corporate greed and an excellent JD. What else you need?
","""Minamata"" is a movie in which we follow the photographer William Eugene Smith (Johnny Depp) traveling to coastal villages in Japan to capture with his camera the effect of mercury poisoning on people. It is a story about corporate greed (Yes, another one....) and thus less shocking as corporate greed is always put above human life. What I am trying to say is that there is nothing shocking about corporate greed as new stories emerge every other day. However this one is unique as it was kept a secret for so long and I never even heard about it. Excellent acting from Johnny Depp despite his personal problems. I enjoyed the cinematography as old footage was used and mixed into this movie. I strongly recommend everyone to watch this movie. It is simply a very good movie, story and the environment should concern all of us.",/review/rw8146227/?ref_=tt_urv

","A Beautiful Movie that no one promotes, I wonder why. It's even sad that people, mainstream media and twitter blue checks don't talk about this movie. Great Performance by Depp and by most of the cast, even by the ""real people"". Touching story. And of course the photography of this film is outstanding, but that's predictable.",/review/rw8146227/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2020,seanfitz-51998,10," Johnny Depp shows why he's a legendary actor.
",Johnny Depp puts in an expected interesting performance but mature. It's as if he's found a different gear in his talent. This movie is powerful and strangely necessary as a result of current times. Well made and there is so much unknown talent in this movie on camera and off and one of the reasons I praised Johnny for a mature performance was because he made those around him go up a gear. Sometimes you can sense competition between actors in award contending movies but Johnny allowed others to shine as well as shining himself to a very high standard perhaps his best performance in years.,/review/rw8146227/?ref_=tt_urv

12 September 2021,Mivas_Greece,8," An excellent representation of one of the greatest pollution and human poisoning scandals. A great Johnny Depp. A movie everyone must see!
","Historical / dramatic film. Filmed almost entirely in Japan, partly in Japanese, Minamata tells the story of the great mercury pollution scandal in Japan in the 1970s that resulted in the poisoning of thousands of people, including their children. Mercury has a direct neurodegenerative effect and can poison even the fetus before birth. A veteran photographer, in the decline of his career and now an alcoholic and broke, is finally persuaded to take photos and give this story to the rest of the world. However, the longer he lives with these people, the more he opposes the local industry that pollutes the environment. A true story with thousands of victims even today, one of the many sad stories of poisoning people and the environment, which becomes a movie like the relatively recent Dark Waters (2019) and Deepwater Horizon (2016). Excellent selection of Johnny Depp as producer and actor, one of his best films and one of the bright examples of showing such true events to be known to the broad audience. Recommended to everyone to learn the truth about these dark chapters of history.",/review/rw8146227/?ref_=tt_urv

","King Johnny Depp has returned, this story alone is one that needed touching on to raise awareness as I'll be honest i was not aware of these issues until i saw this movie, it astonishes me how brutual it really was for Japan, these events are no joke, so tragic. The story being true made it all the more compelling in this movie, Depp steps deep into the character and does he do a good job, I'll be honest i have not seen such a great movie like this in a long time.",/review/rw8146227/?ref_=tt_urv

","Mr. Depp once again showed what a powerful actor he is. I am not going to write about charm and charisma, I will only note that all actors fall into two categories. The play of the first ceases to be perceived as a game and begins to be seen as life. The character comes to life. The play of the latter can be good or bad, but it is always clear that it is just a play. Depp belongs to the first category.",/review/rw8146227/?ref_=tt_urv
