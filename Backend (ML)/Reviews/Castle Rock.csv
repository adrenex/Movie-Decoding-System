22 July 2013,planktonrules,9," Perhaps the film should have been called ""Abe Lincoln and the 13th Amendment"".
","When ""Lincoln"" began, I was very, very surprised. I had assumed the film was a traditional biography of the man, but instead it started late in the Civil War--only months before Abe Lincoln's assassination. That's because despite the title, the film really is about Lincoln and his attempts to push the 13th Amendment through the House of Representatives. Apparently, its passage was very, very difficult--even with a Congress made up exclusively of states that were not part of the Confederacy. The film shows, step-by-step, how the behind the scenes machinations (some of which were of dubious legality--such as offering bribes) led to its passage.",/review/rw2750496/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2012,littlemartinarocena,10," The Daniel Day Lewis Factor
","I remember fondly, Henry Fonda and Raymond Massey as Lincolns in ""Young Mr.Lincoln"" and ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"" They gave remarkable performances. But, here and now in this extraordinary Steven Spielberg/Tony Kushner version, the illusion is complete. I was watching the president and not for a moment thought of the actor. That in itself is close to unique. I left the theater with the feeling I've just had an out of body experience. Everything around the central performance - and I call it a performance because I don't know what else to call it - falls into place in a miraculous way. The photography, the production design, the wardrobe made it possible to actually smell the period. Congratulations and thank you.",/review/rw2750496/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2012,StevePulaski,9," A capsule of a great president and a director's increasing maturity
","Daniel Day-Lewis is something of an unsung miracle; the man will come out of nowhere, select an unlikely role, knock it out of the park, then quietly crawl back into the ground for the next three or four years before repeating the same process. He is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career, somewhat like director Terrence Malick. Here, Day-Lewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men, Steven Spielberg, who is coming off a stellar 2011, where he produced both Super 8 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon and directed both The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse, two acclaimed pictures.",/review/rw2750496/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2014,LloydBayer,8," By its very making, director Steven Spielberg has written the greatest obituary for one of the greatest leaders of the modern world.
","The very mention of a Steven Spielberg project and everyone goes bug-eyed in excitement and curiosity; everyone from casual movie goers to mainstream critics to cinema house managers. Now reunite Spielberg with long standing producing partner Kathleen Kennedy, throw in a multi-award winning star cast lead by Daniel Day-Lewis and a story about one of the most revered Presidents in US history and you have an Academy Award nominated movie by default. Lincoln has all these fine qualities and a whole lot more. This is not just a great film for the reasons stated above, or because it is very easy to praise a film directed by Spielberg. This is also not just a masterpiece or a very important and powerful film for the sake of calling it so. From the drawing boards to its last take, Lincoln is every bit exquisitely fashioned filmmaking — an amalgamation of art, literature, politics, society, history, and most importantly, humanism.",/review/rw2750496/?ref_=tt_urv

3 February 2013,dromasca,6," Abraham Lincoln deserved a better film
","'Lincoln' is one of the bigger favorites for Oscar Awards this year and will certainly be one of the heroes of the evening in Hollywood a few weeks from now. It is made by one of the greatest directors of our time, it tells a big American story and features a big American hero, it enjoys some fine acting and is very accurate in searching into history and retrieving a moment and a story that continues to impact the American social and political fabric until today. And yet, 'Lincoln' did not turn to me into a cinema experience to enjoy. Actually something interesting happens with my relation with Steven Spielberg. The film I liked most is one of his first – the very little known Duel, a minimalistic masterpiece, followed by the wonderful Close Encounters  and E.T. I enjoyed the Indiana Jones and The Jurassic Park series for what they are meant to be – great entertainment. However my personal experience with his 'serious stuff' is mixed. While Saving Private Ryan is for me the best war film ever made, and Schindler's List is one of the best in the Holocaust genre, other stuff looks sometimes pretentious, sometimes too naive. As much as he tries to prove, Spielberg cannot do films about any subject, I mean he certainly can, but not all are that good.",/review/rw2750496/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2016,cdjh-81125,9," Spielberg Delivers A Dialogue Driven Yet Riveting Biopic
",Most people will be aware that Steven Spielbergs filmography can be split into to two categories Action Adventures and Real Life Dramas and Lincoln falls into the latter categories but that's no disservice to the film as I think this is a fantastic film with amazing performances and a riveting story. When you boil it down the thing that are going to make or break this movie are the performances and they all work especially Daniel Day-Lewis who gives one of the best performances I have ever seen he embodies everything that Abraham Lincoln stood for and delivers a performance that is impossible not to get behind and it is easy to tell that the set backs in what he is trying to accomplish are taking a toll on him. Tommy Lee Jones also killed it in this movie I loved every second of his screen time he just seemed like an alternative version of Lincoln. Every thing Lincoln could be if he showed no restraint. The story of this movie is done in a very compelling way just do using in Lincolns last few months in office bringing the story into focus. James Spader was also extremely entertaining in this movie I loved his entire sub-plot of trying to get votes for the amendment and truly stole every scene he was in (except from any scene he had with Day-Lewis). Spielberg directs the film in a way to ensures that the audience is never bored and he doesn't do it in a lazy way by cutting the camera constantly he ensures that something visually interesting is always happening on screen. However my only flaw with this movie is the fact that we never truly saw with our own eyes what Lincoln was fighting for we never see slaves suffering and begging for freedom in fact most of the slaves seen in the movie are treated reasonably well. Of course I understand why one would want to end slavery I just think I would have made for some more compelling scenes in the film. ,/review/rw2750496/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2012,treeline1,," Boring
","The movie examines Abraham Lincoln's (Daniel Day-Lewis) efforts to pass the 13th Amendment in the last few months of his life. It is a detailed account of his strategy and the negotiations of the members of his cabinet, especially his Secretary of State, William Seward (David Strathairn). ",/review/rw2750496/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2013,bob the moo,," Patient and engaging while mostly avoiding sentimentality
","I approached this film with caution and did so for several reasons. First and foremost, this is Oscars season and this type of film is just what one expects to come out and be showered with Oscar buzz – and quite often these films are found to be lacking once they are out of this period and on their own. The second reason was related and it was that I didn't for a second think that this film would be able to go for more than two minutes without the heroic music coming up, a soft focus being slapped on the lens and someone giving a great speech about the morality of everything while the camera cuts to those around looking teary eyed and yet full of admiration. In other words I worried that this would simply be a more expensive version of The West Wing season 1.",/review/rw2750496/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2012,Turfseer,5," Spielberg's narrow in scope hagiography can't hold a candle to 1988 Gore Vidal TV mini-series
","After reading approximately 200 books on the subject, Steven Spielberg's politically correct screenwriter, playwright Tony Kushner, decided it would be best to focus on the last four months of President Lincoln's presidency and the fight over the 13th Amendment, rather than covering Lincoln's entire term in office. Apparently, Spielberg concurred, concluding that a full-blown rendering of Lincoln's presidency would be unwieldy and the more narrow focus would perhaps be more dramatically effective. He could have proffered up a three and a half hour spectacle, covering many of the significant bases of Lincoln's political and personal life, beginning with the first Inauguration, with full knowledge that it's been done before quite effectively (Sam Waterston's and Mary Tyler Moore's magisterial performances in the 1988 TV movie adaptation of 'Gore Vidal's Lincoln' come to mind).",/review/rw2750496/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2017,elo-equipamentos,9," Abe Lincoln and Day Lewis!!
","No doubts about Abrahan Lincoln was the most important person on US's history for all times, fourteen thousand books were written about this ""Special One"", but this picture is about the man, the director and producer brings to us a Lincoln more closely than never and Daniel Day Lewis is a lucky guy really among a lot of American actors he was chosen to make history, an Irish man making Lincoln is unbelievable, but it's true and he was remarkable performance really and won the Oscar, of course that Spielberg tend to slide out sometimes as chat with those soldiers and planning to travel to Israel (oh my God!!) anyway who know the director can forgives him after this great picture which he done to us and to understand US's history properly !!",/review/rw2750496/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2015,Vartiainen,7," Oscar-worthy performances all around
","Once again a fine proof of Steven Spielberg's love and respect for historical dramas, and of his ability to pull them off with dignity and grace. Lincoln, telling the tale of President Abraham Lincoln's attempts to dissolve slavery during the Civil War, is certainly admiring in tone, but not so much that it becomes ridiculous. It paints Lincoln as a man of higher morals, larger than life, but yet it acknowledges his humanity and the everyday side of his life. It shows us both his grandeur and insuperable ability to lead as well as his good humour and problems with his family.",/review/rw2750496/?ref_=tt_urv

","For those of you who do not enjoy history or politics, I wouldn't watch this film. But for once, there is a historically accurate and rather entertaining film based on one of the greatest Presidents of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. This film will take you behind the scenes and in the mind of ""Honest Abe"" as he tries to pass the Thirteenth Amendment in Congress. This film is beautiful film in many regards. It has blissful cinematography, a subtle but great score by John Williams, great direction by Steven Spielberg, and just top-notch, amazing acting.",/review/rw2750496/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2014,Buddy-51,9," A great historical film
","For his biopic ""Lincoln,"" rather than try to cram a man's entire life into a two-and-a-half-hour running time, Steven Spielberg has wisely chosen to keep the focus circumscribed and narrow: on the winter of 1865, four years into the Civil War, as the President works to secure passage of the highly controversial 13th Amendment, which, when ratified, will abolish slavery as an institution in the United States for all time to come. Lincoln's main hope is to convince a skeptical and still highly racist public that such a move is essential to bringing an end to a war that has already claimed 600,000 of their young men's lives. The obstacles that remain are the Democrats in Congress who are universally opposed to such a move and many Republicans who think this constitutional amendment may well pave the way to universal suffrage, with not just blacks but women ultimately being given the right to vote. Lincoln's major hope is to convince a sufficient number of lame duck Democrats to come over to his side, while not allowing the amendment's passage to throw a monkey wrench into any possibility of surrender on the part of the Confederacy.",/review/rw2750496/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2013,thrwmbsbgkdoepmcjrmrdw,10," Great movie
","I love, love, love this movie! I can't say enough great things about it. I'm so glad that Daniel Day-Lewis won the Oscar, it was so well deserved. I thought that Sally Field was robbed of the Oscar. This is not just a wonderfully great film, but an educational one as well. I learned things about that time period and Lincoln that I had either forgotten or never knew. I just loved it all the way through from start to finish. All the actors were great. I think that the guy who played Seward was a bit overlooked as I felt he was just as good as Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones. I saw this film three times in the theater, it is that good. It's well acted, well directed, well edited, well put together and an A+ film. If you haven't seen yet, don't delay go rent it today.",/review/rw2750496/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2013,TheLittleSongbird,9," Not the most accessible of films, but still a great one
","Much of Stephen Spielberg's output I do like very much. Not all his films post-Saving Private Ryan have been great, but there have been a handful that have been and Lincoln is one of them. I can though understand why some wouldn't like it, the first hour is lengthy and slow as well as quite talky. I think it may also depend on how much you know about Abraham Lincoln and the 13th Amendment, in the case of my mother she found the film interesting but because she didn't know much about the subject she didn't always find it easy to follow.",/review/rw2750496/?ref_=tt_urv
