6 February 2020,lolly67,10," Again...WHY do they cancel ALL the shows that make you have to pay attention?
","I am in the last 11 minutes of Season 2 Episode 10 and wanted to see when the next season was. I fell across this show on Amazon Prime and was completely engaged as soon as I started watching. LOVE J.K. Simmons, so I knew it would be good, but I had no idea how good. So many other talented actors just made it even more fun to watch.",/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2019,orchidami,10," Why on earth would they cancel this show?
","This was like the best,most original,excellent cast,excellent story,excellent writing and really just entirely fantastic acting. Why would they cancel a show that is so good? Who makes these ridiculous decisions. It was so unique and so entertaining that really irritates me that it was cancelled.",/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2019,jrwygant,10," Perfect!
","Only two seasons? Obviously not simple enough for most viewers. And not enough plot cliches. I watched every episode of the two seasons and never felt cheated or regarded as too dumb to follow the story. However, if you're looking for science-fiction, this is not it. The parallel worlds element is kept in the background. These episodes were character driven and shined with excellent acting and great scripts -- a lot about relationships, who we think we are, and how others see us. I have always been a J.K. Simmons fan, but I've never seen him so good. And the rest of the cast deserve equal praise for what they delivered. Yes, it could get a little confusing at times, but nobody I know nodded off through any of it.",/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2020,dalefl,8," Another great show cancelled. Unbelievable.
",I'm halfway through season two of this fantastic show. In the process of finding out when three is coming out and I find it's been cancelled. Then I see the reason why and I am dumbfounded. It's too male. Let me repeat it so it sinks in. It's too male. What does that even mean? Half the cast is female with some of the most central plot aspects including the most bloodthirsty killers on the show. Who thinks like that? They pulled the plug on one of the best shows on television because it didn't revolve around enough women? That is one of the stupidest reasons I have ever seen. I guess Kartrashians isn't male enough and that ridiculous Oak Island show isn't stupid enough. Unbelievable.,/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2018,SAJK007,8," Good Quality Genre TV That Can Appeal To Non-Genre Viewers
","I suppose I am not surprised at a lot of the negative reviews here. This is a subtle show. If you like your science fiction without starships, loud photon torpedoes and men throwing cars at one another --then this might well be for you!",/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv

1 February 2020,csb2019,10," Exceptional in so many ways
","I could (positively) rant about this show for hours as it is not only well written, courageous in selection of location, timeline and characters but also monumental in actors' performances.",/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2022,ranchofiesta,10," Starz can't take a win
","Just like a lot of other reviewers, I wondered loudly ""WHAT?? Only 2 seasons?? WHY?""
I was drawn in half way through the first episode! I found Counterpart on Amazon Prime and wondered why I'd never heard of the show. I have Starz and I do not remember ever seeing this. I love J. K. Simmons! I would remember this show!",/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2020,lenord-97628,9," Not Fair!
","I hope it's not true only 2 seasons of this incredibly addictive series. Always seems to happen when there's something good it goes away due to the bottom line. I've always been a fan of Simmons work, his lowkey anti-hero style is always superb this role here is typical of his abilities, in fact it's hard to see flaws in any of the actors, all believable in their roles.I just finished season 1 and can't wait to dive into season 2 even knowing I will Not see a fitting ending, no 3rd season what a pizzoff I could see this concept going on for years.",/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2019,SnoopyStyle,8," murky, challenging, rewarding
","Howard Silk (J. K. Simmons) is a middling bureaucrat in a secretive UN agency in Berlin. He is in Interface at the Office of Interchange exchanging unknowable codes. His counterintelligence wife Emily (Olivia Williams) is in a coma. He's a long-time loyal employee and still has no idea what the operation is about. Director of Strategy Peter Quayle (Harry Lloyd) rejects his application for promotion. He is brought in for a meeting with his doppelganger. Quayle reveals the shocking truth that some 30 years earlier, an experiment in East Germany had opened a portal to a parallel universe where everything is the same. Clare (Nazanin Boniadi) is Peter's wife. Baldwin (Sara Serraiocco) is a ruthless assassin from the other side. It is revealed that the two sides have diverged over time especially after a devastating flu epidemic in the other world and now there exists a state of cold war between the two worlds.",/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2019,bogus-bogus-one,8," Interesting, well done, entertaining
","This show has everything I love about entertainment.
It science fiction about a cold war with three main classes of players, ""management"", spy's and their ""counterparts"".
The rest of the population (us viewers) watch the difficulties and negotiations of their daily situations and relationships.",/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2020,mfilby-96979,10," Crying Shame
","In the days of trash TV designd for ill educated simpletons a show like this never had a chance, shows like ""blind spot"" and ""Lucifer"" get countless formulaic seasons boring people to tears whilst Stars go and Cancel the one good show that's been put together in years, obviously top drawer acting and locations are simply not enough to keep the brain dead masses entertained, the shows cancellation really was a crying Shame",/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2019,boydpeters,10," Not sure if given a 10 before, but this show is faultless
","After watching the abomination that is Brightburn, it was refreshing to find a serious well written, well acted, original, gripping, juicy, hanging, hooking",/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2018,shivamt25,8," J.K. Simmons is awesome!
","Counterpart is based on this amazing concept. Something happened during the Second World War because of which the world got split into two parallel dimensions. Now, there is an organization which keeps the balance between the world by acting as border patrol at the gateway through which you can travel to the other dimension. It all becomes visible to a low-level employee when he found out that his 'Counterpart' - i.e. himself from the other world has come through and all hell is about to break loose.",/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2017,theredandwhitekey,9," Brilliant
","Unexpected, dark, quirky, Counterpart is a noir sci-fi fantasy playing in today's world but within a setting mixed with modern (2017) and retro (1970's) locations and gizmos- The story is not about the past, it is about the present, but of 2 parallel worlds that connect through a secret doorway or hallway, and just as it mixes between the contrasts in these 2 worlds in the story so does it mix in its set design, with a little hint of dystopia here and there.

14 December 2017,CorumJI,8," First episode only... so far, so good...
","This is an odd, quirky piece, not a lot of action, but a lot of ""what the hell...?"" to keep you engaged.",/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2017,chirox,9," Potential To Rival Westworld
","A strong opener with a particularly strong performance from JK Simmons, Counterpart lures you in without quite knowing where you are going and then blam! the story opens up and gives a reveal to what is to come.
Simmons is both the mild mannered civil servant and his 'counterpart' hardened 'in the know' operative, he plays both roles strongly enough to believe they are two separate persons and is a good enough actor to hold the opener to the series on his own, although a decent performance from both Ulrich Thomsen (Banshee) and Harry Lloyd make this a tough contender.
For those with a love of sci-fi without lazer guns and 'pew pew' noises Counterpart will ring, it has the quality feel of Westworld right from the opening music and had me girpped within 2 minutes.
Decent tempo to the opener, not too fast and not dragging its heels, helped keep interest alive right up to the final scene.
I hope it lives up to it's potential.",/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2018,s3276169,8," Beautifully balanced....
",Counterpart beautifully balances the notion of alternate realities and alternate lives whilst blending in a tale of political espionage. ,/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2019,richardhoehn-25081,10," SUPERB
","Why in the world was this only given two seasons?? The Cold War spy vs spy story line may sound dated, but really it's not: It's a Cold War between two parallel universes (basically). The acting is superb. J K Simmons is great, as is the supporting cast. Rich character development.",/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv

30 January 2018,MoistMovies,9," How is this going unnoticed, next big hit
","The acting is really incredible
The story is fresh, and not old.. No idea what that one review is going on about. And i have literally seen almost every piece of science fiction made in the last 50 years.... perhaps they are making comparisons to bookes more than film, which in that case everything has been written about 100x over. Its almost impossible to come across a book written today that doesnt share something from a previous work before. especially science fiction...
I for one have never seen a cold war style parallel universe show before. 
And nothing close to a scifi show with this intriguing of a plot with a high budget and one of the best actors around. Science fiction until very recently wasnt considered high enough caliber to attract these types of actors.... 
But the genre is finally being adopted by all the biggest directors around now and attracting all the best talent. Mute and Annihilation this year will be amazing. Counterpart is up with them as far as im concerned",/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2019,AvidWatcher101,10," Starz cancelled???? NOOOO.
","So no season 3 from Starz. I am so disappointed. Not often does such and intelligent and watchable show come along. The news is that they are shopping around season 3 and I sincerely hope some other network has the foresight to pick it up. This series has everything I love - great acting, riveting story, gripping drama, mysteries, spies, love, revenge, action... It's new and different, and yet the age old archetypes are alive and well. Truly hoping to see a third season.",/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2019,sara-lorenzen-811-601421,10," This show ought to have a ton of rewards
","I don't understand why Counterpart hasn't gotten more attention. The manuscript is so clever, the acting is superb and the cinematography is amazing. It is deep and thoughtprovoking and fun and thrilling and just the best spy show, I can remember.",/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2019,luciosamorall,9," Shame it won't be a third season.
","I find it hard to believe that such a show hasn't garned a broader audience - certainly deserving of one. Needless to say, I do hope the showrunners find a new home and are able to continue the series.",/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2019,harri-46424,10," Really well thought, designed, directed and acted
","So sad that it will not continue. It is the total opposite of todays most tv series. It has an interesting setting, every episode reveals something you have not anticipated. It keeps you hooked but not with a superficial content.",/review/rw5206381/?ref_=tt_urv
