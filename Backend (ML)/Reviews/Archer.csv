19 November 2022,cardsrock,2," You can't convince me this is a real movie
","This movie is one incoherent scene full of people who don't even remotely act like real people after another. Ben Platt and Kristen Bell are absolutely insufferable and made me actively angry. There's almost no explanation for how awful these characters are or why they hate their sister for no reason. This isn't an Always Sunny in Philadelphia situation where it's entertaining watching awful people do awful things, it's more so I want to rip my eyeballs out and extract the memory of this wretched pain from my brain. Also, this has some of the most egregiously disgusting product placement I've ever seen. It's like watching that fake Korean Subway tv show from John Oliver.",/review/rw8702663/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2022,solojere,5," Should've been better
","I was excited for this movie because it actually has a lot of good actors. Ben Platt was great in the Pitch Perfect movies and Dear Evan Hansen. And Kristen Bell is pretty much great in everything I have seen her in. However, these two actors couldn't save this train wreck. Simply put, The People We Hate at the Wedding is a mess. The premise is interesting enough a dysfunctional family comes together for a wedding. But the pacing is all over the place. The jokes were really dragged out and often didn't hit the mark. They are also all kinds of terrible people with first-world problems, which could just aren't that interesting. There wasn't a single character I related to or even liked. The pros are that it is on streaming, so you don't have to pay for it or see it in theaters. But I wouldn't recommend it and probably won't watch it again.",/review/rw8702663/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2022,danieljfarthing,2," Dire so-called comedy full of crass, shallow, vile, whiney & dislikeable characters - abysmal
","In dire so-called comedy ""The People We Hate At The Wedding"" crass Americans Ben Platt (awful) & Kristen Bell attend half-sis Cynthia Addai-Robinson's Brit wedding (with mum Alisson Janney) despite hating her for no genuine reason. With equally dislikeable / poorly acted supports (Karan Soni, Julian Ovenden, Dustin Milligan et al) they then wreck proceedings with puke, piss, etc while whining about themselves. Despite cameos from the likes of Rufus Jones (good) & Randall Park, with lead characters SO shallow & vile (sister writers Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin & Wendy Molyneux screwed up BADLY (as did director Claire Scanlon)) it's no wonder this one is SUCH a turd. Flush it.",/review/rw8702663/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2022,hughman55,1," I Hate All the People at This Wedding
","And the writers, and the director, and myself for watching this piece of crap all the way to the end. It is one of the stupidest movies I've seen in a while. Point of personal privilege here: I'm going to focus on the gay couple. Not because it's worse than the other storylines. They're all equally AWEFUL!!! It seems that a lot of gay storylines lately center around whether or not to turn your relationship into a three-way. Ok, I'm gay, in a relationship for a while, know lots of other gay people, single and coupled, and literally NOT ONCE has that topic ever surfaced personally or through any of our friends. Not once. And yet, if you go by the latest films released, with gay characters, you'd think that that is the driving tension for all of us... Also, anal sex has to figure in prominently in our every day discussions about anything. And last, and then I'm done with this drek, the writers think it's hilarious that the main female's ""boyfriend's"" last name is Bottoms. Get it, bottoms??? Like anal sex bottoms??? That is SOOOOOOOO funny.... One can only hope that this mess sinks to the bottom (hahahah) of the sea and disappears forever.",/review/rw8702663/?ref_=tt_urv

","Okay, Streamers, we have a lot of family movies coming out around this time. Studios are putting out their Christmas fare early. There are those romantic comedies and so many other films that are supposed to appeal to broad audiences as the families get together for the holidays. Amazon released on Prime Video a family comedy based on a novel with the same name, The People We Hate at the Wedding. Here's how the wedding bells tolled.",/review/rw8702663/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2022,wookie-78784,3," Over the top attempt at comedy - big let down
","This had the potential to be a funny film, instead I found myself kind of disgusted by some of the characters actions and dialogue. Very little was believable and some characters were really quite horrible, self absorbed, whiners. I know films are meant to exaggerate or be farcical sometimes but the situations these characters were in were so over the top it really made no sense. I wanted to root for at least one character but really didn't, none were that interesting and few had any redeeming qualities. Many reviewers commented on the location, I have to agree. London is a beautiful city and the best thing about the film is that it was mostly shot there.",/review/rw8702663/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2022,dedawson-82561,4," You disliked the people before they got to the wedding
","We started this movie at the suggestion of the NYT, but after about 25 minutes we looked at each other and said, ""Haven't laughed yet."" Kristen Bell is cute and Allison Janney has her comedy chops, but this mish-mash is so disjointed and so reliant on cheap sex situations that we gave up and turned on the news. None of the characters were sympathetic and the opening sequences were so truncated and unclear that we found ourselves wondering who was who and why they mattered. It's too bad. The premise seemed to have great possibilities. Maybe it gets better by the end but where we stopped it seemed pointless.",/review/rw8702663/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2022,con8,1," Depression - the only thing I took away from this movie
","This movie is just a bunch of scenes thrown together and I don't even think it's trying to be funny. To be honest I'm not sure exactly what this movie is meant to be. I went into it not knowing what to expect but I have enjoyed Kristen bell movies before, and I often watch movies with zero expectation and are presently surprised, but this is definitely not one of those times. Even the only nice (likeable) character - the guy from the plane who likes Alice, makes absolutely no sense she has displayed absolutely no reason why he should like her.",/review/rw8702663/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2022,chanellejholder,1," The Trailer Was Better Than The Movie
","Husband is out for the evening, so I get the kids to bed early and think to myself, I'll have a glass of wine and watch a good chick flick. I've had my eye on this movie for quite some time now. But I was literally waiting for the perfect opportunity to watch it. I saved it like I would a yummy piece of cheesecake (I'm clearly on a weight-loss journey). I literally kept my phone far away from me to avoid distractions. I was ready to get absorbed... This movie was the equivalent of sitting down to enjoy that piece of cheesecake to only find it's been infested by magots. I'm crushed! I've loved every single lead actor here! How could they do this to me??? You're better than this Ben!!! The creators of this movie owe me for this! What a missed opportunity for a night watching a classic chick flick... Like The Wedding Planner.",/review/rw8702663/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2022,simonwoodwrites,2," What a mess
","This should've been a fun romcom but it was awful. The story felt slapped together at times with bizarre story developments thrown in at times (like the loving dad being revealed as a homophobe and the narrator voiceover) and there were so many pointless scenes that went nowhere. There's no comedic timing and nothing hangs together. The major issue is the film features a cast of unlikeable characters who are unaware of how horrid they are. Part of the issue with the character unlikability is the seemingly lack of justification and what justification there is seems pretty superficial. It's not helped by the fact that the cause of the family strife is never established, just referenced. There's nothing redeemable about these characters which made this film a chore.",/review/rw8702663/?ref_=tt_urv

6 December 2022,asmithee23,3," The people we loathe at the wedding
","The half-siblings are selfish, self-centered and self-absorbed. But on the plus side, they are also thoughtless, crude, rude and crass. Immoral behavior at work by both Platt and Bell, acting like it's no big deal. Treating their English half-sister terribly merely because she's rich. Making idiots of themselves, being ""ugly Americans"" was embarrassing and angering. Fine. You hate your own choices. Don't be jerks. Poor behavior can be funny, even hysterical but it wasn't here. I don't think I laughed once. Always Sunny in Philadelphia is funny. It's laugh and groan inducing. This just left me angry.",/review/rw8702663/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2022,lakesbus,1," Written by straight middle schoolers?
","Was this written by straight middle schoolers? There are no likeable characters at all in this movie. There is cliche after cliche. But come on, the old standard of gay guys are always swingers? Found that quite offensive. The script tried to portray a disfunctional, sad family but it ended up with a bunch of sad whiny selfish fools ruining each others life. Amazon and Netflix are trying to spit out so many movies apparently to hit some quota and they are missing on content, character development and story. We gave this movie a try and regretted it. But like a car burning in on the side of the road we continued to watch. And we're sorry for it. And the ending was absolutely horrible, basic and simple. I watched this because of Kristen Bell, who I think is amazing. No more. Lastly - my wife has said I am never ever allowed to pick the movie, ever again.

The words used most throughout other reviews is ""cringe-worthy,"" and every scene made me cringe x 10.

21 November 2022,dfloro,6," Really should be better with this good of a cast.
","Allison Janney has been nominated for and won so many awards over the past 30 years that it takes a separate, linked Wikipedia entry just to list them all. For her mere presence in this movie I must give this movie an extra star on its rating. And Kristen Bell, of Veronica Mars and Frozen fame (and all the ensemble & supporting roles in both TV & movies that she's had in between), isn't exactly chopped liver, y'know. So then why isn't this made-for-streaming movie better than it is? Honestly, I'm not sure. But if you're a big fan of these women (as I am), or of the young Tony-winning star of ""Dear Evan Hansen,"" it's still worth the 99-minute investment to watch.",/review/rw8702663/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,bmiller59,1," What was I thinking?
","I very very rarely look at the rating and/or read the comments while I'm watching the movie, but, I did with this movie, The People We Hate at the Wedding. And, I'm still watching it. There is NO redeeming quality of this movie. I thought with Kristen Bell and Allison Janney, this would be a hoot, and there were some funny scenes but those are rare and far between and are overpowered by the nonsense that is The People We Hate at the Wedding. I guess at the end there will be a Life Lesson...oh yea, I turned it off. I won't get the chance to see the life lesson because I gave up on it and fortunately I didn't pay anything for it.",/review/rw8702663/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2022,CinemaSerf,5," The People We Hate at the Wedding
","Talk about contrived? Yikes! ""Eloise"" (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) makes the cardinal error of inviting her estranged and dysfunctional family to London for her posh wedding. Her brother ""Paul"" (Ben Platt) and his boyfriend ""Dominic"" (Karan Soni); her unpredictable and unreliable sister ""Alice"" (Kristen Bell) who is having an affair with her married, architect, boss and finally her mother ""Donna"" (Allison Janney). It seems that they all pretty much loathe each other in equal measure, but they all decide to attend and in so doing ""Alice"" hooks up with the handsome ""Dennis"" (Dustin Milligan - probably the only decent person in the whole thing) with the others going through the usual relationship tribulations that, aside from a fun scene in a Thames-side inflatable champagne dinghy - rarely raise even the faintest hint of a smile. What Miss Janney is doing in this is anyone's guess, and without a song to sing I am afraid that Platt is just, well flat! I think the trick with good comedy is having characters that we can at least like. I struggled here with all of them before the ending that could have been seen by a blind man from outer space. The soundtrack is quite good now and again, but otherwise the writing and direction offer us nothing at all new here and it almost left me wishing for Henry Golding's equally lacklustre Christmas effort from 2019!",/review/rw8702663/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2022,dbuckshnis,9," Over the top story lines that happen in real life.
","First off, I am a huge Allison Janney fan, as well as a Kirsten Bell fan, and the acting is very realistic and very entertaining. So I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The individual arcs of each storyline is hilarious and expected - the ex parents get together, the jilted sister finds another and then is thrown back, and the threesome discussions. Of course - the wedding itself and all the acting makes for a good movie. Eloise was fabulous in her role -",/review/rw8702663/?ref_=tt_urv

","Amazon won't let you rate the movie until you see the complete movie and I just couldn't. I agree with all the 4 & 5 star comments. Good actors in a bad movie. I didn't believe any of the relationships. Or laugh one time. Daughter having sex with a stranger on the plane and with her boss. Daughters who squabbled because one didn't visit the other during a miscarriage. Son is easy to slide into a relationship with other men. Mom and ex-husband who haven't seen each other in 20 years fall into bed. TOOO much! It all seemed forced. And according to Amazon this is the #3 watched movie. I don't think everyone got through the whole movie. London, though, looks like a fun destination.",/review/rw8702663/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2022,nickijjohnson-16955,3," Started out with potential
","I feel like once it got past the Christmas family photo it stopped being funny. Paul and Alice are unfortunately main characters and both of them are incredibly unlikable despite the actors playing them. Paul is your cliche stuck up snobby gay guy. A personality like his is usually cast as a side character but as a main it's annoying. Alice is pathetic enough to have an affair with a married man who just had a baby. The typical thinking he'll leave his wife for her even though he has her pretend to be his Uber driver when she drops him off at home. They both hate their sister Eloise for no other reason than the fact that she is rich. Ironically they both seem to think she is snobby and judgmental because of this when they are in fact the snobby and judgmental ones. The sister Alice is angry at Eloise for not coming to visit her after her miscarriage which is understandable and should have been the only reason she was mad at her and not the immature ""I hate you because you're rich"" shallow crap. I thought the brother and his boyfriend attempting to have a threesome were pointless unfunny scenes. I suppose unless you're gay and into threesomes you can't really relate and most comedy is funny because it's relatable. Some tweaking was needed for instance Alice having a relationship with a man then finding out he's married as opposed to willingly jumping into it probably would have made her more likeable. The brother having a boyfriend who wants a threesome and he doesn't probably would have made him more likeable. I think Eloise not being able to have children was a good reason for her to not visit after her sister's miscarriage but the writing was off in the confession scene. She should have said something like ""I was so upset I just wasn't in a place to comfort anyone."" It was actually quite understandable. Allison Janney as the pot eating mother was perfectly fine. To me it was really just Alice and Paul whose characters needed better writing especially for the likeable actors playing them. You know characters suck when good actors can't even save them. That said I thought it was a nice clean happy ending and probably what I liked most about the film. They tied their childhood family photo into the end new family photo so it wrapped up nicely.",/review/rw8702663/?ref_=tt_urv
