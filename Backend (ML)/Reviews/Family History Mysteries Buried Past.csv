8 November 2017,CineMuseFilms,5," Gorgeous production cannot disguise the contrivance and melodrama
","How could such a beautiful looking movie fall so flat? Sumptuous filming, a stellar cast, with brilliant period sets and costumes are not enough to disguise the fact that Tulip Fever (2017) drowns under the weight of its own plot contrivance and melodramatic performances.",/review/rw4217009/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2017,paul-allaer,3," There is a reason this has been sitting on the shelf for years
","""Tulip Fever"" (2017 release from the UK; 107 min.) brings the story of a young Dutch woman's love tribulations. AS the movie opens, we get a quick (animated) introduction how tulips entered into the Low Lands. We then get to know Sophia, an orphan living at the St. Ursula convent in Amsterdam. She is married out to an old guy. We then are informed that it is ""Three years later, Amsterdam 1634"", and Sophia has not yet been able to provide an heir to her husband Cornelis. At some point Cornelis commissions a portrait from a young up-and-coming painter Jan Van Loos. At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw4217009/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2020,AlsExGal,5," A love story hinging on wild improbabilities
","A love story (actually two of them) play out amid the backdrop of the famous tulip mania of Amsterdam, ca 1634. Both love stories hinge on wild improbabilites that are almost laughable. The story is based on a novel so we can perhaps blame it on that. Regardless, the movie is vastly entertaining (but not in the so-bad-it's-good category. There is a lot to like.) As we are told Tulip trading was rampant and ""fortunes were won and lost"" all because of a ""beautiful flower.""",/review/rw4217009/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2018,Karlien1968,8," If you like period drama, do not listen to the negative critics!
","I loved it...I really did. It is slow paced, what I absolutely like.
The costumes where beautiful and detailed.
Also the scenery was well done and gave an atmosphere of how it used to be.",/review/rw4217009/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2017,tigerfish50,1," Tulip Flu
","'Tulip Fever' transforms a promising idea into Dutch farce as its script heaps unnecessary complications onto a tale of marital infidelity in 17th century Amsterdam. The film opens with beautiful penniless Sophia being married off to a wealthy middle-aged merchant who desires a male heir. After three years have passed and no child has appeared, the merchant commissions a double portrait of himself and his young wife for posterity.",/review/rw4217009/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2017,werwolf_dk,4," Tulip Fever is not contagious
","Here is only one review of the 2014-version. Based on that review, it is fair to say that some of the plot holes have obviously been stuffed, while others are still wide open (or have been opened). I don't know if the holes have been faithfully adapted from the book or if they were specifically designed for the film.",/review/rw4217009/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2017,goaltenderinterference,4," Like tulip bulbs, this film needs to be stored in a cool, dry place
","Tulipmania is one of Europe's weirder historical events. Unfortunately, the movie barely touches on the tulip market craze, except as a deus ex machina to bestow sudden wealth and/or loss on characters who we barely care about and who do nothing to deserve it. ",/review/rw4217009/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2018,rsg-25524,9," I quess you either love it or hate it
","People seem to be negative about this film. Frankly with all the action adventure, violent, and plain poorly written films out there this one stands above those. All the actors give us good character portraits and the action and plot move quickly. If you like period films then this would be for you. I'm sure if I analyzed it to death I would see the flaws, but it was an enjoyable film.",/review/rw4217009/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2017,PradoCedric,1," Tulip Fever just wilted into ridiculousness
","Oh, how the mighty had fallen for this nonsensical romance. Even the great actors and actresses such as Alicia Vikander, Judi Dench and Christoph Waltz couldn't save this historical period romance misfire. Even Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne is involved in another follow-up misfire (Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets). Perhaps there is more to meet the wilted tulip in its detail; Talk about on its crappy Fifty Shades of Grey-styled sex scenes between Vikander and DeHaan which NO ONE is buying it (not sexy and spicy) and probably the chemistry is very muddled and confusing at the same time. Even the screenplay from the acclaimed screenwriter, Tom Stoppard is completely wasted.",/review/rw4217009/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2018,TheLittleSongbird,4," A badly wilted and undernourished flower that fails to bloom
","Despite the critical panning and the very delayed release, a large part of me was really intrigued into seeing 'Tulip Fever' because there is a good cast here (it is hard not to go wrong with Alicia Vikander, Christoph Waltz and Judi Dench individually, seeing them in the same film together promises even more) and have always been very fond of period dramas.

3 September 2017,lorenjahns,10," Ignore the critics and see this movie
","I almost skipped seeing this movie because of bad reviews, but I am so glad I went anyway. This is really an excellent film. I cannot see for the life of me what the critics (both professional and ordinary moviegoers like myself) are pissing and moaning about. The story moves along quickly, with lots of fun twists and turns and lots of interesting characters who are established early and then return at surprising moments. Lots of good steamy sex too, so stay away if you don't like that. I read reviews about the weak acting—they are all wrong. Judy Dench totally nails her role. It seems I have to relearn this lesson over and over: IGNORE THE CRITICS!",/review/rw4217009/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2017,eliahgolan,8," It was sublime
","I loved it. After reading the reviews of other users, I had no expectations from the movie. But, I was very surprised after I finished watching the film that I actually thoroughly enjoyed it. The plot itself is very intriguing and forces the viewer to enter a game of guesses and speculations on what will the characters dare to do next. It's a wonderfully playful and thrilling love story that I would recommend everyone to go and watch.",/review/rw4217009/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2018,Reno-Rangan,9," An affair that changed the lives of many around it forever!
","It is very sad to know that only blind people have seen it. Otherwise, this is not a response the film deserved. It was almost a solid 10 out of 10 film. Superfast narration. Beautiful setting. Of course the background score was good, but if it had an even better catchy score, then it would have been one of my all time favourites.",/review/rw4217009/?ref_=tt_urv

20 August 2017,HillstreetBunz,7," Strong source material, cast and detail overcome confused and shaky 1st reel.
","I had the privilege of seeing this film in preview in the famous Tuschinski theatre in the heart of the canal district in Amsterdam. Having enjoyed the novel whilst living there in 2011, I have watched as it's release dates have been continually changed giving all the signs of a production in distress. Early rumours of poor test screenings can be damaging whether true or not! Like another reviewer I found the opening narration at odds with the images and consequently confusing. The first 40 minutes edited in a pedestrian style merely to tick off necessary plot points, and without any sensitivity to mood or place, so prevalent in the novel. Strangely, the movie seemed to be both full of beautiful 'pictures', historical detail, visual treats and mood, and yet at the same time, the continued use of one street set left it feeling small and enclosed and almost like stage set. Little sense of Amsterdam as a City State enjoying a glorious rise on the world stage. At that point (after 40 minutes) having laid out the plot points and established the characters, the film starts to build, thanks to the real tension in the original story, a good script and some fine performances. I got over a niggling feeling of disappointment at the 'smallness' of the set production, and instead decided to enjoy the abundant visual detail and the way the story started to rip along. Ultimately the great story rose above the shaky first reel and the production design above its limited scale. I was with two friends who hadn't read the book, and we all three came to really enjoy the film, despite the confused and hurried beginnings. It deserves to rise above its production history and be widely seen and enjoyed. It doesn't quite reach the heights of the source material, but it's far from a failure with much to enjoy.",/review/rw4217009/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2017,Sherazade,2," WTF did I just watch?
","Stupid fever is more like it. Irritating as heck cast (except for the always marvelous Dame Judi Dench) essaying a disjointed and irritating as heck variety of roles guided by an irritating as heck script about star-crossed lovers who barely meet each other before they decide to start humping each other like bunnies all flanked by the backdrop of the 17th century Tulip rush in Amsterdam. Don't even get me started on that maid because I would never finish, she was so entitled and utterly irritating I almost had to stop watching. If you wanted to be stupid on-screen Justin Chadwick, first get actors who aren't irritating to dilute the script as well as our suspense of disbelief so we can at least tolerate you making a fool of yourself.",/review/rw4217009/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2017,kaptenvideo-89875,5," Pretty but basic historical love story

25 May 2019,dierregi,2," Gorgeous photography in search of a story
","It starts as a bawdy comedy, bordering soft porn, but it does not feel sexy, it continues as a romantic drama, without being really dramatic and it ends with rightful closure for all characters, leaving a feeling of having being defrauded, just like Cornelis.",/review/rw4217009/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2017,Kirpianuscus,," nice.maybe
","with the chance to be beautiful. because it seems be example of impeccable strategy: the actors, the Amsterdam, costumes, flavor of an old world, provocative love story, tragedy with profound roots. the only sin - the high , rich ambition to say all the story in a manner remembering labyrinth.and the total ignoring historical accuracy. and the shocking political correctness who is more than bizarre or shocking. this is the basic sin. who transforms a sort of fairy tale in a confuse trip across stories, love stories, secrets, crazy plans and solutions. sure, it has virtues. and it is charming. but something change the basic flavor. and the seduction is reduced.",/review/rw4217009/?ref_=tt_urv

26 June 2018,eddie_baggins,4," A talented cast cant save this period drama
","Filmed way back in 2014, to say that the background of Tulip Fever is one of much change and concerning history is an understatement and upon evaluation of the final product, it seems as though this is one particular period drama that would've done well to sit out its life on the shelf of what could've been.",/review/rw4217009/?ref_=tt_urv
