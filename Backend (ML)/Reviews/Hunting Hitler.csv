4 October 2019,jeremycrimsonfox,9," Underrated Film That Teaches A Good Moral
","Lewis is an 12-year-old orphan who is always inventing things. However, in a science fair, he meets Wilbur, a 13-year-old boy from the future who is chasing after a Bowler Hat Man who came to the past to steal Lewis' invention, a machine that shows memories. When he steals it, Wilbur takes Lewis to the future, as Wilbur explains he is chasing the villain due to him stealing a time machine. This would lead to an adventure where Lewis meets Wilbur's family, The Robinsons, and stop The Bowler Hat Man from changing the future.",/review/rw4239164/?ref_=tt_urv

31 March 2007,cjd-16,7," Disney 'keeps moving forward'...
",The tagline of this movie is perfect... because it describes exactly what Meet the Robinsons means for the Disney Feature Animation studios... a step forward. Disney had been on a slide in the last few years... they were beginning to make cheap comedy movies with thin characters and story lines. I am happy to report that those days are over.,/review/rw4239164/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2007,AvBaur,7," Disney is getting back on the right track
","I'm writing reviews for a German movie website and thus got into a press screening of the new CG animated Disney movie ""Meet the Robinsons"" in Munich a little while ago. I'm a big animation fan myself and love many of the old Disney movies, although lately I've been more impressed with Pixar's films than anything Disney had to offer in the last few years. However, the story of this one is actually quite interesting and not as uninspired and generic as Disney's last traditionally animated feature Home on the Range or as messy as their first CG outing Chicken Little. It offers a number of nice surprises and even a good plot twist or two without causing too much of the old time-traveling headache. The humor also works quite well, although many of the jokes seem to be aimed at adults and little kids might not get all of them. (Didn't bother me, thoughÂ…) Most importantly, this film does not contain a single fart joke nor any talking animals or even animal sidekicks (except for those singing frogs you might have seen in the trailers, but they're really not the same thing). I don't know how close this adaptation is to William Joyce's novel ""A Day With Wilbur Robinson"", as I've never read anything Joyce has written, but it all works pretty well and manages to be an exiting and entertaining family adventure movie.",/review/rw4239164/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2017,TheOneThatYouWanted,10," An Underrated Masterpiece
","One of the most underrated Pixar joints out there. I'm late to the game watching this, I don't even remember it coming out, which must mean the marketing is to blame. Whatever, moving on. The characters are based on a short story but the film is more or less an original futuristic animal. It is about a few orphans boys, time travel, an evil hat- android and an insane family. The magic behind the film is almost everything else about it except for the characters borrowed from the children's novel it is supposedly based on. The magic behind this film is that it is more or less a love letter to Walt Disney and the ideals he built his company on. To simplify it, this film is Disney World's Tomorrowland mixed with Walt Disney ideals. This film is an excellent hidden gem and I highly recommend it.",/review/rw4239164/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2018,Animany94,7," An overall good expirience despite its flaws.
","From the second dark age of Disney the movies were rather hit or miss. Most of them lacked the same creative spark and wit of earlier productions, but once they hit rock bottom with the embarrasing Home On The Range and the ugly mean spirited Chicken Little they steadily rose from the ashes.",/review/rw4239164/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2008,ccthemovieman-1,9," ""Funny, Cute, Touching and Overall Very Entertaining Disney Effort
","For much of this film, even though I was being entertained by it, I thought it was geared mostly for kids.....and that's fine. That's what I always thought the target audience was in animated films. I just got spoiled with so many good ones in the last few years that also had a lot of funny material that adults enjoyed, too. Films like ""Cars,"" ""Madagascar,"" ""Barnyard."" ""Chicken Little,"" ""The Polar Express,"" and so forth. Well, in the end, I have nothing but praise for this film, too, because it had some touching qualities to it that would emotionally involve a person of any age. ",/review/rw4239164/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2007,mummy99,8," I was pleasantly surprised at how much a 50's something mom of a teenager liked this movie.
","I went to the theater this afternoon to catch an R-rated film and goofed on the times. The only movie available in my time frame allowed was Meet the Robinsons. I reluctantly bought a ticket and was pleasantly rewarded with a movie experience that reminded me very much of my childhood. When we got to go to the movies in the 50's and 60's, there were trailers, followed by the newsreel and then a cartoon before the main attraction. The non-three D version started with non-R rated trailers, followed by a Mickey Mouse cartoon (loved it!) and then the main feature. It was very entertaining to sit back and relax and not worry about the good guys dying, the amount of slaughter that would be portrayed, or that there wouldn't be a positive message at the end. As an adult, there were enough references to keep me entertained and from the sounds of the kids in the theater, they were obviously enjoying this movie. I would highly recommend it to all but the crankiest movie-goers, and I personally loved the quote from Uncle Walt at the end of the movie. When I was little, our whole family watched Walt Disney every Sunday and I particularly remember when it changed to Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color. Walt Disney was a man ahead of his time and I really miss his adventurous spirit and inquisitive mind. He introduced and ended each episode and I really enjoyed seeing him every week. I wish that Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color was still on every week and that new episodes would still be made.",/review/rw4239164/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I first saw this movie, it terrified me. I don't remember how old I was, but I was scared. When I rewatched this movie later, I found it funny and entertaining. There is some stupid in this movie, but overall its enjoyable.",/review/rw4239164/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2008,dbborroughs,9," One of the best Disney films in years
","Trying to figure out when the last time a movie from Disney proper charmed me like this, not sure. I love the Hefalump movie and I'm a fan of Treasure Planet- though once Martin Short shows up I think it goes off the rails. Hefalump aside (Thats a TV movie on the big screen- so I'm dismissing for purposes of comparison on that technicality- though its easily one of my favorite Disney films) I think this probably the one film from the Mouse House I'm happiest with since Lilo and Stitch. Is it the equal of Lilo? no it doesn't have the ""This is my family, its broken but still good"" moment that makes me cry every time- nor, and most importantly it does not have the bra wearing caped crusader(though there are moments and lines...)",/review/rw4239164/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2007,mapar,10," ""Back to the Future"" meets ""The Incredibles""
","Somewhere Walt Disney must be smiling. ""Meet the Robinsons"" is the perfect, unlikely marriage of manic, absurd humor, eye-popping visuals and honest-to-goodness emotional depth. It is a close cousin to the first ""Back to the Future,"" yet it feels completely original at the same time. The 3-D animation works seamlessly within the story. It is not played for a cheesy gimmick (like, for example, ""Spy Kids 3-D""...groan). In fact, it is so well integrated into the narrative that you could almost take it for granted, so it's a good thing that at the heart of ""Meet the Robinsons"" there is a wonderfully entertaining story. In typical Disney fashion the central character is a motherless (and in this case, fatherless) youth -- however this time it is not merely a device whose sole purpose is to leave him unencumbered to embark on his own adventure. In fact, his orphaned status and quest to find the mother that left him at the orphanage as a baby IS the point of his journey. But there's no room for sugary sap here, thanks to an almost unending stream of quirky characters and plot twists. Of course stories like this can't succeed without a great villain. In this case the filmmakers have managed to craft a bumbling villain who is simultaneously hilarious, sympathetic and just menacing enough to keep the tension going. He reminded me of Snidely Whiplash, Mack the Knife, and the magician from Rankin-Bass' ""Frosty the Snowman,"" all rolled into one.",/review/rw4239164/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2007,Smells_Like_Cheese,8," Cute and fun for the whole family!
","I saw this movie a little over a week ago and I thought it was a pretty cute Disney film about the future of tomorrow. Meet the Robbinsons is one of those animated films where it has humor for the adults and the kids that works well and really clicked, not to mention the animation looked fantastic. While it's still not the best animated film this year, I would agree that it's in the top and wouldn't be surprised if it does get an Oscar nod for best animated film. It really was that good, I was kinda surprised by the average rating on IMDb, I thought the users would get a kick out of this film, but you can't win them all.",/review/rw4239164/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2007,dslentz,8," Great, but a little frightening for very young children
","Was a little ""ify"" about taking my 5 and 2 year old daughter's to this movie. Actually was concerned that it may not hold their attention. Based on some reviews, I honestly didn't think I would care for it.",/review/rw4239164/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Meet the Robinsons"" is just superb in every way - plot, animation, characters, substance, and music. All put together in an astoundingly gorgeous film - easily enjoyed by ALL ages. Clever, clever humor and wit - many things that only adults may understand. Loved the way the story progresses and how it ends.",/review/rw4239164/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2007,boysandbetsy,10," Inspiring the Uninspired....
","Outside of the beautiful faces that I helped to create and another that made an honest man of me...I truly loathe most everything that passes as...anything, truly. I took two of my sons and a young friend of theirs to see Meet The Robinsons, today. Having never wanted to shout anything from a mountain top - let me just offer up a piece of advice for anyone looking for something uplifting, inspirational - heartbreaking but re-affirming...you must see this movie. I'm a braveheart guy, I love goodfellas and Will Ferrell movies - I'm an idiot; but I can't imagine hearing more beautiful words come out of my sons mouth than when we left the theatre and hearing him say ""that movie made me feel good about myself"". Poetry - from the mouth and mind of someone who doesn't know any better - or any worse. The movie is about - and this isn't a spoiler - family and caring for someone other than yourself. It isn't standard Disney stuff - even though that sounds EXACTLY like standard Disney. I'm running out space and I'm not completely making the most sense which is exactly how I feel at 37 anyway....",/review/rw4239164/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2021,mitsubishizero,9," Heartwarming and inspirational
","I remember watching this movie as a kid and enjoying it. The theme is simple yet powerful, ""Keep Moving Forward"". It's definitely a step up from Chicken Little. Lucas is an aspiring inventor who struggles to keep his gadgets functioning. As if that's not frustrating enough, he has to deal with the fact that he's an orphan who doesn't know who his mom is. Things get stranger when a boy claiming he's from the future appears and starts following him. Before he knows it, he finds himself in the future. Where it seems anything is possible.",/review/rw4239164/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2019,tabuno,7," Tries Too Hard
","23 July 2007. Unfortunately this amazingly animated visual delight was spoiled in part by the excessive effort at trying too hard. The plot was very good, the emotional content was excellent along with the message of the story, the use of time travel was solid, but the execution in a number of spots, especially with the supposed villain was overdone and sometimes vapid and inconsistent with the overall tone of the movie. The use of animation for this particular project was apt and was spot on, the mix of realism and animation well balanced. If only the over-dramatization would have been reigned in this movie could have been another ""The Incredibles"" that made a clear mark as a classic. Unfortunately, this good movie just didn't have the consistency throughout to make the grade. Seven out of Ten Stars.",/review/rw4239164/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2008,ackstasis,8," ""Take a good look around, boys. Because your future is about to change.""
","In recent years, I've come to the conclusion that, as far as American studios are concerned, Pixar is the only one producing great CGI-animated films. However, its always a delight to be proved wrong, and I am surprised to find that 'Meet the Robinsons (2007)' is a truly terrific science-fiction children's film, one that exceeded all my expectations. Produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios, with John Lasseter as one of the executive producers {so it's not so far from Pixar, after all!}, the film is my most unexpected favourite of 2007, boasting a fresh and intelligent screenplay, as well as impressive 3D visuals. Though the film deals with time travel, a rather sophisticated concept in itself, director Stephen J. Anderson ensures that the plot is straightforward to follow, approaching the notion of paradoxes in a manner than is easy for children to understand without being exasperating for adults. In addition to a terrific script {which is credited to about seven screenwriters}, 'Meet the Robinsons' also has a motivational maxim from which we can all take something: ""keep moving forward!""",/review/rw4239164/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2018,tesswysko,8," Family Fun Trip Through The Present and The Past
","I've seen this movie 2x now, my child is grown, so I watched it for my own enjoyment, and THAT should tell you something! This is a fun family movie, but it also has a deep, involved storyline following the main character, a young man that approaches him at the science fair and turns out to be from the future, and a second player in the game, a man with an almost sentient bowler hat who also shows up at the science fair and sabotages our Hero's project! We are also following that our Hero is an orphan, and that plays a large role in the film. So, whether you're a child just looking for a cartoon from Disney with a lot of laughs prat falls, or you're an adult looking for something with a little deeper storyline to entertain yourself too, THIS movie is a great choice! They did a great job all around!",/review/rw4239164/?ref_=tt_urv

2 April 2007,sstanfie,9," You Can't Turn Away
","A heartwarming story with eye-popping 3D special effects. If you have the option of seeing this in 3D, you should opt for it. The story is strong, so you will enjoy it either way, but since 3D is a rare instance in this day & age, you should go that route. This movie has a stellar cast that may not be the big A-list names like the Dreamworks movies, but they are very talented and well cast in their roles. I prefer the subtlety of casting for quality versus stunt casting, and this movie delivered. You can tell that John Lasseter played an important role in this movie - ""Cars"" delivered the message that the journey is more important than the destination and ""Meet the Robinsons"" delivers a message about not living in the past...keep moving forward. John Lasseter should be commended for helping lift Disney features back to their glory days. I will be the first to admit that they are not there yet, but with his help and movies that focus on the story & the characters like ""Meet the Robinsons"", we won't have long to wait...",/review/rw4239164/?ref_=tt_urv
