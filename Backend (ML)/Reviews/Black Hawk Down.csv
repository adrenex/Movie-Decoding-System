6 May 2022,Otte1,4," Started out interesting...and then....
","First episode catches your attention, maybe even the second. After that the series divulge into long monologues that do not go anywhere, lots of unnecessary singing(not making this up, one character sings complete songs each episode) and the whole 'let's not solve this in 3 seconds by talking it out but stretch it over 4 episodes by not talking'. It is one thing to have some secrets for a big reveal, but everyone has secrets on many things without providing a valid reason outside of moving a weak writing.",/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2022,mathomas-28053,8," basically good, but uneven, because of direction changes
","Everything's been said in the first 200 reviews, except for this: these people have got to stop giving each episode to a different director and/or different writer. The quality, and the whole concept, goes up and down randomly from episode to episode. The characters look the same but speak and act differently. Find a good writer and keep him/her. Find a good director and keep him/her. Complete variation in tone and concept is NOT what we want in a long story.",/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv

6 May 2022,qui_j,2," A long slog with a poor return on investment
","This series manages to pull you in with the promise that the payoff will be huge, only it isn't! It's as if the script were written by writers who were high on acid or mushrooms. The scenes are all disconnected, and events occur with little or no context or explanation. It's just bad.....and a total waste of time!",/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2022,nincubura,5," WOW! Then turns into soap opera

22 April 2022,Pistol219,7," Josh Brolin... Say No More
",Such an underrated show. Nobody has true taste anymore for real cinema. The show is spectacular obviously it's not Yellowstone it's totally different story line. So people can stop comparing it to that. Josh Brolin doesn't amazing job as always show is awesome and down 10 out of 10.,/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2022,Sunsphxsuns,9," SNOOZE AND YOU DEFINITELY LOSE!!!
","Why is it that the ""slow burn"" series seem to automatically, almost magnetically, attract an immediate handful of bad reviews? Mistaken identity or just impatience? Or perhaps, a little of each? Showing some patience will be amply rewarded. It's a ""slow burn,"" which allows the plot to unfold naturally.",/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2022,Alcaminhante,8," So far, one of the best and most refreshing scifi tv of recent years.
","Great slow moody pace which of course infuriates all hollywood blockbuster fans, really intringuing storyline and somehow a cross between something like the german Dark on netflix, the x files, twilight zone and a touch of twin peaks.",/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2022,slak96u,," Now pass the GD potatoes
","Showrunner/writer Brian Watkins is a complete unknown, and there is no source material to cheat off of. However, Plan B, the production company that is producing the series also produced OA, the Sci Fi thriller series that ran on Netflix and was a fantastic series. Hopes are high, the lead actors are all very, very strong. What I do know, for absolute sure... Yellowstone, yeah, this ain't that. Just because a show has a rancher doesn't mean it should be directly compared to Yellowstone, this show feels ABSOLUTELY different. The production, cinematography, music, writing, acting....name it, Outer Range has a completely different tone.",/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2022,bosporan,5," Clan chronology chaos
","A Stormy opening, a crisp Chronos monologue and the Anarchy brand, followed by a family hubbub where patriarch Royal (Josh Brolin) loses track of time. The scene is set in five minutes, a tale of time, family and dramatic events. Storytelling at its finest!",/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2022,ben-mckimm,3," Nope
","First episode really hooked me... From there onward, it turned into some family drama where everyone cried all the time and that one guy sings a full song, every episode. I guessed the big twist, that is revealed in the last episode, during the second episode.",/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2022,Almost_Soldout,8," mystery is back on track
","Glad seeing mystery got its popularity back after a while. This year we have been seeing quite a few shows in this direction and after first 2 episodes of this I would definitely give it 8- for some twists are quite cheesy and some cast isn't at its best but at least it's intriguing, really.",/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2022,kellybethga,2," Tired of it at episode 4
",Why doesn't he just tell his family about the stupid hole?!? It's like one of those romance novels where they break up because they don't tell each other anything. There's absolutely NO reason not to tell them the truth. Argh. Done with this stupid show.,/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2022,sandynolen,6," Get to the point!
","Started out good, good actors & plot, but what's with all the minor side bars that take up all the time? All the fighting, lack of communication causing problems make me want to go in and grab their tongues to make them talk. Nowhere are there that many people that don't communicate with their families! It makes the show drag on & on & on.",/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2022,starjosie,9," My need for the next episode is next level
","Sci fi mystery as a western got the blood moving. Brolin is an uber believable rancher caught up in some weird as hell other worldly oddness, kid problems, ranch problems, neighbor problems, moral problems, it's really a full plate. End of episode 2 was like...omg. Cannot wait for episode 3.",/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2022,neji-san,5," 6 episodes is enough for me.
","Josh Brolin kept me watching, also the mystery about the hole and the Mix with sci-fi. Its beautiful shot but my Problem is, that in every episode only 1-2 Minutes something happens and thats not enough to keep me watching till the end. Those 6 episodes would have perfectly fitted into 3 episodes so far. Too man scenes and dialogues that stretched every episode. But I'll def watch the last Episode when it's out.",/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2022,frankblack-79961,5," Bizzare and chaotic charachters and storyline.
","On the surface this was shaping up to be quite good. As the season progresses it becomes quite a messy little story. For such a small population in Wyoming, there a quite a large number of wierdos around. Its hard to really explain what i didnt like other than it just became too ridiculous even for a sci-fi show. Lost interest by the 6th episode.",/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2022,UniqueParticle,9," Very enjoyable so far
",I was curious about Outer Range when I saw trailers/ads it seems exceptional although it is kinda slow but most likely gets better with the build up! The cast is perfect and I absolutely love the mystery in nearly anything. Not sure why IMDb doesn't classify it as thriller only drama/mystery seems something magnificently dark is happening in it. Everything Imogen Poots says is poetic brilliance I love her in any role! I'm quite intrigued for more than 2 episodes.,/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2022,jordan2240,2," This is like a dream...
","... that you wake up from and think ""WTF was that all about"". Essentially, no character in it is worth caring about, and much happens with no explanation whatsoever. I assume there will be a season 2 since nothing was resolved, but it will carry on without me. Huge waste of time. At least the episodes were under an hour.",/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2022,joiningjt,9," SOLID SOLID show mix of drama scifi and some action and a BRILLIANT cast especially Josh Brolin!!
",As usual Josh Brolin is phenomenal but the whole cast holds their on the story is a mixture of lost and dallas. I like the family aspect as well as the ranch side and the battle of the families but by far the scifi addition is our favorite and why we're watching. Won't give anything away but it's a binge worthy show a little lull in the middle but a solid ending with of course a cliff hanger so we BEST get a season 2 which I'm about 95 percent sure we will.,/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2022,MoistMovies,7," About to watch... * edit after watchinging a strong 7 so far. A lot of opportunities for unrelated genre of scifi and western. This is not Yellowstone.
","But when I see initial reviewers complaining about pacing issues.. I Have to wonder how bad their ADHD is.... supposedly I have that maledy... but I manage to not judge a first ep on pacing problems. In face when picking a new series to watch... that is far from a decider in the first ep... the 3rd to 5ht? Of a 10 ep series? Sure. Analyse pacing then... but writng, direction, editing, acting and many more things over shadow pacing if the series or film is trash from the get go.",/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2022,MickyG333,8," 'Yellowstone' and 'Lost' had a baby?
","Envision a love child between Yellowstone and Lost, and Outer Range is spawned. There are definite correlations with shows like Twin Peaks, Black Mirror, Stranger Things, Tales from the Loop, and... Constantine? I don't know, maybe that last one is a stretch, but we will see. It's Just a hunch. It contains all the same elements as Yellowstone, even set in Wyoming, so just replace Kevin Costner with Josh Brolin and - POOF.",/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2022,rslicker,5," Confused!
",I really want to like this as it should be my cup of tea. However I've watched all available episodes and am essentially none the wiser. Biggest problem is that I don't really like any of the characters. You have to be rooting for someone. You need to care. Autumn's character is beyond annoying. Can't figure her out but beginning to think she has serious mental health issues. That should make me care about her but it doesn't. Too many really weird and unrealistic characters. I'll keep watching though because I have to have answers.,/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2022,varangian-66072,2," The hole keeps it going
","If someone would tell me what that hole is or does, I would stop watching this show in an instant. Nothing else makes any sense in it.",/review/rw8103881/?ref_=tt_urv
