8 June 2021,amonteirojr,6," Decent follow-up, but lacks tension
","Not hating on the movie and I'm actually glad they moved away from the haunted house formula, injecting a bit of other genres like criminal investigation but even though it's well paced, there's less of those nail bitting moments i love from the series. The cast still deliver the goods and the story, despite having a few weak spots was still engaging, but with far less memorable moments compared to the previous chapters.",/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2021,akerstrom_94,6," We missed you James!
","NO SPOILERS! Weakest of the series and and I have to believe the missing piece was director James Wan. The scares were way too predictable, the script felt one note and even though I went in cold I could still see the ending a mile away. Solid turns by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as they have always done but still even they couldn't elevate this one.",/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2021,BandSAboutMovies,2," The Devil wants his name off this.
","You know, the Warrens were not Catholic superheroes. Despite warning us that the world was in a constant battle with demons, the Hollywood Reporter divulged that ""in the early 1960s, Ed Warren initiated a relationship with an underage girl with Lorraine's knowledge. Now in her 70s, Judith Penney has said in a sworn declaration that she lived in the Warrens' house as Ed's lover for four decades.""",/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2021,tresm87,7," Without Wan directing it doesn't have that same detail and dynamic, but it does continue the Warren's adventures serviceably with solid story/scares.
","As I said, the film doesn't have the same power and unique feel as Wan's 2, but it is a nice continuation in the franchise with an intriguing story that does delve into the crime drama genre along with giving us the scares we come to know. You can tell Wan still was involved with certain camera works and scare concepts much like he was with the mediocre yet entraining curse of LaLlarona which this director Michael Chaves debuted on. While he doesn't fill Wan's shoes at all, he was able to follow a certain format for this particular franchise to move forward though at dragging pace at times.",/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2021,ranapreet2255,6," Change the director for the next part please.
",Least scariest out of whole conjuring universe.,/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2021,PedroPires90,7," The weakest, but still solid
","It's a different Conjuring, trying and innovating, not only in the story (no haunted house here) but also in the use of camera/direction, where we feel that we have a new director and with a different identity (good).",/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2021,colinrfricke,5," Why Fix what isn't broken??
",This third movie in the series was just ok. The director attempted to move the story away from the typical haunted house storyline of the previous two films. The problem is that the first couple films were very much liked so why deviate? True there needs to be some variety but most of these hauntings have enough variety to satisfy that.,/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2021,SnoopyStyle,6," lacks tension
","It's 1981. The Warrens (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga) are participating in the exorcism of a boy named David Glatzel. It leads to the case of Arne Johnson who claims that The Devil Made Me Do It.",/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2021,jtindahouse,5," Doesn't derserve to share the same name as the original Conjuring film
",I try to avoid trailers for movies but the 'The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It' trailer came on before a couple of movies I went to in the cinema and I was forced to see it. I could tell even just from the trailer than James Wan's absence was going to be noticeable and significant. I hoped I was wrong - but I wasn't. To be fair I think that this story wasn't strong enough for him to touch anyway.,/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2021,jakerz-74411,6," Not terrible, not great
","Super predictable jump scares, not nearly as scary as the other movies, it's so easy to tell when something scary is about to happen but when it does it's not even really scary.",/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2021,Abdulxoxo,6," The weakest entry in the conjuring universe so far
","Like the first two films, this one is again loosely based on a true story. Ed and Lorraine Warren are called upon to help exorcise a demon from a young boy. This would lead to the demon passing into another body, whom it would use to commit a murder. The case would go to court, where it would be the first example of a defence of demonic possession being made. It's then down to the Warrens to investigate and somehow try to prove, to a legal standard, the existence of demons.",/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv

","Everyone who's complaining that they're too much story and not enough scares, are you kidding? Story and character is the reason why we care about the stakes-that's where drama, tension and horror comes from. If it was all jump scares and lacking in story (the movie Winchester comes to mind), I guarantee y'all would've been even more disappointed. But if that's your thing, you'll probably be just as entertained by a jack in the box. While remaining faithful to the Conjuring universe, I appreciated that this third movie explored new territory so it wasn't just a repeat. It is a quality addition to the series with good production value, and much more thoughtfully-written than the spin offs. It's a win for what it is considering the impossible task the writer and the director had of pleasing all these harsh fans who couldn't even tell you what they liked about the first two conjuring movies other than ""it was scary.""",/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2021,alejandro-bonilla,3," What scared me the most was the original recording of the exorcism that they put with the credits, I think that says it all.
","What the movie lacks is originality, I don't think it's good for a movie that the viewer suspects what is going to happen and happens. When I saw the The Conjuring 3 I remembered the reason why I stopped watching the fast and furious movies, I could no longer separate one from the other, because each new sequel was exactly the same as the previous one, mediocre, it hurts because they really could do more . What scared me the most was the original recording of the exorcism that they put with the credits, I think that says it all.",/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2021,med-01081,5," Just Ok. More story than scares and lack of suspense.
",I was looking forward to this film and the dreaded suspense and scares that this franchise has mastered over the years and was left disappointed. What we got was more story of the Warren's and their battle against evil and the played out snapping body part movements that the Japanese mastered 20 years ago. The first two conjuring films had suspense and scares galore where you would almost hide from the anticipation of what is coming but on this occasion i found it a bit lacking. It is still worth a watch and the story is decent i just expected a lot more from what has been some of the best modern horror films to date.,/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2021,kosmasp,8," True story (well sounds better if you say it is)
","So I did not research the couple that is depicted here, but it always sounds better if you say that something is based on something real and true. This is pure horror but it still was a nice double bill with A Quiet Place 2 at the Festival I saw them the other day - so good to be back in cinemas. Now you may think that that may have swayed me to give this a bit of a higher/better rating that you would have given it ... maybe, but then again I am known for being nice to movies most of the time, than the other way around.",/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2021,conn-57441,7," A decent sequel.... without the scares!
","After watching the 'The Conjuring: Devil made me do it' at an early screening last night, I have to admit I was a little disappointed that it didn't live up to the expectations of the previous two films in the main trilogy ( however it stands tall over the spin offs, so don't worry there).",/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2021,diegocoda,5," A Scooby doo live-action movie without horror?
","Yep, the saga just lost the main factor of their movies, the horror, this movie just feels like a mystery movie where you need to follow the leads and find the bad guy and is not boring the only problem is that is not what we want to see, we go and see this specific movie for horror but is never appear, in my opinion, is a good story but wrong franchise and that makes it the worst one of the saga(leaving Anabelle 3 out)",/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2021,paul_haakonsen,4," Just another generic entry into ""The Conjuring"" franchise...
","I must admit that when I sat down to watch the 2021 addition to ""The Conjuring"" franchise, I was not harboring much of any overly great expectations or hopes, because since the first movie it has been a steady downward slope.",/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2022,Misss25,3," Why????
","This is the worst Conjuring movie of the entire movie series. I had high expectations about it. Among all the horror movies, Conjuring was the one that has a good story line with amazing story but this is just beyond my expectation. This comes out so badly. I have been waiting for this movie so long and this is just a trash :)))",/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2021,Xstal,4," Abracadaver...
","Invoking everything you've seen before and embellishing it without mystery, suspense or tension, devil clearly not in the detail, the only nightmare: you wake and recall watching it the next day!",/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2021,BrnzReviews,9," That Was Intensely Satisfying!
","I've been waiting for this moment for a very long time, another addition to 'The Conjuring' & its brilliant. I've always been as much of a fan of horror/scary movies as much as the next guy but this was so satisfying to watch, it was so good to get back into the dark room vibe, any time i watch these types of movies i always do so in a pitch black room, the story of this was excellent, enough build up scenes to have you questioning why wasn't this made sooner!",/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2021,dhirenjb,4," Where is the horror?!
",This movie is such a drag. So unlike the previous installments. There is absolutely no tension and you don't feel connected with the characters.,/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2021,AdrenalinDragon,6," Alright sequel could be worse
","Maybe I'm starting to get a bit of fatigue from these Demonic/Exorcism films, but it was just alright. Nothing groundbreaking and plays things straight, but fairly competently shot and well executed effects. If anything, the Warrens are what kept me going from start to finish. Without them, it definitely wouldn't be nearly as good. The weakest of the three main Conjuring movies pretty easily though. Perhaps James Wan needs to come back. That being said could be worse.",/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2021,kjc-32205,3," Really not good; pales in comparison to the first two...
",This sequel should have been left alone. The story is so filled with inconsistencies and silliness that it is just hard to include it as part of the original Warren saga. The directing was generic and the plot was more like heroes versus villain rather than a good solid horror story or retelling of the Warren's cases. So sad to see good solid actors put in a movie where their talents are just simply wasted. Not worth seeing...,/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2021,thefendiprint,3," Dull, lifeless and not a drop of scary
","I seriously am confused by some of these high ratings... Did we watch the same movie? This was objectively the worst of the franchise, and simply as a film, it was pretty bad overall. Nothing in the film was scary, and honestly it played it way too safe the entire time. There is absolutely nothing new here story wise that we haven't seen in every other demon-centered horror film. Nothing that stands out, nothing that will make this film memorable by any means. Is it the worst horror film I've seen? No, but it's definitely one of the most lackluster I've seen.",/review/rw7000454/?ref_=tt_urv
