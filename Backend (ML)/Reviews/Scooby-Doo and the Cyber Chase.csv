","The horror anthology has a chequered history, some are bad but saved by one great segment, others boast a couple of genuine creepers but are undone by one instalment so bad it tarnishes the film forever. And on it goes. V/H/S brings the format into the new age by unfolding its tales by wrapping around the latest craze of found footage.",/review/rw2784411/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2012,Red-Barracuda,8," Excellent found footage horror anthology
","Some folks might be a little deterred from seeing V/H/S when they learn it's a found footage movie. Well, rest assured, there's nothing to worry about as this is an excellent example of the sub-genre. Perhaps at the root of the film's success is its structural format. It's an anthology movie, made up of a selection of short stories based around a series of videotapes found by burglars at a scary house. While some of the segments are better than others, where this one scores is that even the weaker stories contain some very scary moments. Each and every one delivers the goods in this respect and that's half the battle when it comes to horror flicks. The different stories are basically disturbing in the way that the best found footage flicks are, in that we are literally put right into the shoes of these people and their terror transmits more easily.",/review/rw2784411/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2012,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,8," v/h/s (2012)
","I love found-footage films, especially when they are done well. I also love horror anthologies withe some of my favourite TV shows being The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, and Tales From The Darkside. The two joining together for V/H/S was a very exciting idea and gave me very lofty expectations. I was amazed to find that for the most part they were met. V/H/S sees a gang of guys break into a house in order to steal a video cassette for blackmailing purposes. Once in he house they find a huge collection of videos, each one showing a different tale of horror. The first is the story about a couple of girls picked up from a bar and recorded secretly on camera glasses. This is probably the scariest tale with some very disturbing imagery. I still can't get the look of a certain character out of my head. In it's short running time it also hits upon some emotional notes that I wasn't expecting. Perfect effects and nailbiting tension make this a great start. Video number two sees a couple on a road trip who are secretly filmed at night. The idea of an intruder watching you at your most vulnerable is nerve-racking. Story number three was my least favourite but was still mostly effective. It was let down by cheesy dialogue that over explained the details of the plot. The effects here were again very well done with a sickening look at an eyeball sliding out of a socket. Story number 4 is shot through Skype and has the biggest ambitions in terms of plot. I would like to see this again as I didn't enjoy it at first because of a terrible performance from the male lead, but there is a reason for this which makes sense after viewing. The final tale is a haunted house film that builds up incredibly well. It starts with an empty house and moves towards all hell breaking loose with some of the most flawless effects I have ever seen. Each story was interesting and most importantly it kept to the rules of found-footage. Everything appears as though it was done in-camera. It's left me thinking about the stories and getting my imagination to work overtime as not a lot is explained. The only real let down was the wrap-around that tried to connect these stories. It really didn't work and just made the film a bit too long. When I buy this on DVD I am pretty certain I will be skipping those parts. Hope we see a V/H/S 2.",/review/rw2784411/?ref_=tt_urv

","For those who love shaky fake found footage, this one is da bomb. A group of criminals film their escapades of vandalism and assaults to sell to a buyer. They then enter a house to get a VHS tape, they will know it when they see it. The rest of the movie shows us found footage film within a found footage film. Oh joy. There is a dead man in the house sitting in front of a series of TVs. Each hooligan watches a film segment, then disappears from the movie. The film segments are not connected, i.e. there is no real common theme other than it is more snuff than horror with a different type of monster/entity in each piece.",/review/rw2784411/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2013,mrda1981,8," A nightmare world on videotape
","Arranged around and within a tenuous wraparound home invasion scenario, the vignettes that comprise this shakycam shocker prove memorably effective, each lulling the viewer into a false sense of security via meanderingly mundane set-ups that abruptly shift to more unnerving, visceral territory. Old tropes such as alien interference, haunted houses, serial killers, and femmes fatales find themselves fed through the lens of the hand-held camera to rather impressive effect. The overall picture painted by these series of snuff flicks-within-a-flick is one of a world sporadically at the mercy of an otherworldly array of entities, with the glaring unremarkability of its setting serving to amplify, rather than undermine, the atmosphere of cosmic malevolence. All these elements amount to a punchy anthology which succeeds in overriding my antipathy toward the dreaded jittercam technique - no mean feat!",/review/rw2784411/?ref_=tt_urv

","I can understand if you do not like the so-called 'found footage' films, for example; Blair Witch and Cloverfield. I must admit, some of them work, some of them don't. Cloverfield worked for me, but only on the big screen in a cinema. Blair Witch worked for me, but only on a small PC monitor.

11 July 2012,turbo_t_7,9," Fresh from Toronto After Dark
","Listen, the only way to truly enjoy a horror film is in a large, pitch black room with deafening surround sound and a group of people just as scared as you are. Other times, a laptop works too. But I, and a group of about 100 others were privileged to catch the first Canadian premiere of V/H/S presented by the Toronto After Dark Film Festival. Enough plugs, onto the film right? My review. See it! If you love horror, if you hate horror, if you think you might like it and wanna try it out, just see it! Without spoiling anything I will say that there are about 5 or 6 anthology stories tied around a main story in which four guys break into a house to look for a specific video tape. They find a lot more, let me tell you. Some of the segments are better than others (trust me, you'll know which ones) but overall, V/H/S is one of the most imaginative, jolting, riveting, heart-beating-outside-of-your-chest-because-its-so-intense horror films of recent time. Fans of Creepshow 1 and 2, Tales From the Darkside, Twilight Zone (the movie) and even Stephen King, if you get the chance to watch V/H/S, do it! It's bloody, it's scary, it's haunting, and if you're anything like me, you'll know it scared you when it's 1:43 in the morning and the only thing you can do to make yourself fall asleep, is to review the film on IMDb.",/review/rw2784411/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2018,TheMovieDiorama,2," V/H/S has as much use currently as a Video Home System.
","Vague Horror Segments. Vicious Harmful Stupidity. Very Heterosexual Shenanigans (seriously, so much ""tittage"" on screen). The concept should've worked, blending the recent ""found footage"" sub-genre with an anthology narrative structure, providing not one but six terrifying short stories. However, its execution absolutely missed the target as it was an incredibly dull, overlong, unwatchable mess. The story arc revolves around a criminal gang who break into a house to steal a single VHS tape, but they soon start experiencing unusual happenings as they watch other tapes. A gang approaching an innocent woman to film them sexually harass her, a group of friends wanting to record a amateur porn video, a husband wanting to record his wife undressing, two guys making innuendos towards a blonde teenager in the middle of the woods and a creepy boyfriend who clearly adores a good sexualised video chat (complete with female nudity). These are just five of the six stories, each of them obviously encompassing the same distasteful theme. Sure most of these characters gain their comeuppance, but if these short stories are shot from their perspective then there is no investment to be made. They are all unlikeable. The horrific camerawork with constant glitches only adds to my frustration with this film. It is simply unwatchable. Aside from the final short '10/31/98', there were no scares or suspense. One of the VHS tapes is a recording of a video chat on a Mac (makes no sense). The acting was mediocre, particularly the video chat sequence. Honestly could that guy look anymore less in love? The frame narrative strings the short stories together with no cohesion. And a nearly two hour runtime felt like five hours. I appreciate the anthology structure allows new directors to have a chance at showcasing their talent. But this was not the way to do it. Each short got progressively worse and my boredom levels and lack of patience increasingly heightened. A wasted concept with squandered potential. I'm just waiting for the inevitable 'D/V/D' to be released...",/review/rw2784411/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm a big fan of anthology horror movies, and horror in general and I'm willing to accept found footage movies if they're done well enough. That being said this is not done well at all. They use every found footage cliché except night vision. Constant ""glitch cuts"", people carrying the camera around while in danger for no reason, disoriented confusing action sequences.

29 September 2012,nickmesafilms,7," V/H/S (2012) - A Found-Footage Style Horror Movie! Doesn't that Remind You of Anything? Yeah, That's What I Thought!
","Released early on demand, after it's premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, ""V/H/S"" is a horror movie told through the ""already tired"" aspect of found-footage material, shown from the perspective of a hand-held camera. A group of hoodlums has been strangely assigned to break into an abandoned haunted house, and steal a particular V/H/S tape. But once making it to the house, they start to find a wide collection of plenty of V/H/S tapes, and we are introduced to a series of ""found-footage"" shorts, as the group starts to watch each tape at a time, as if the audience is in the room, with these guys, watching the tapes. Each tape has a different particular horror story, some work, and some doesn't. Let's recap each one! 1. A group of guys start to become haunted by a strange woman during a ""guys night out"" (Works), 2. A married couple on their second honeymoon, whom doesn't realize that a certain someone has been sneaking on them (Kind of works), 3. A group of friends being hunted down while on a trip to the lake (Hardly works), 4. A young girl communicates with her ""doctor-to-be"" boyfriend over the Internet, believing that her apartment is being haunted (Doesn't work), and 5. A group of guys awaiting an awesome Halloween party, but they got more than what they bargained for (Perfectly works). ""V/H/S"" is probably one of the most scariest, and one of the most disturbing movies I've ever laid eyes on. Filled with plenty of great scares, some disgustingly grotesque moments, and tons of scenes that will leave you speechless. Now, there are times when this movie follows almost every horror cliché in the book, and although this movie is supposed to be portrayed as a ""found-footage"" feature, the camera movements are a little too shaky. But, this movie does stay true to it's promise by giving such scares that won't let audiences sleep later at night. Although I prefer ""The Cabin in the Woods"" as the better horror movie this year, I prefer ""V/H/S"" as the better horror movie in the terms of scaring me, grossing me out, and leaving me awake at night! In ordinary horror movie fashion, there is plenty of great fun to be found in ""V/H/S"". I'm just saying you've been warned, because if you're somewhat interested in seeing it, I must warn you that this movie is sick and grotesque, leaving audiences in a stage of vomiting and sleeping with the lights on.

","What's your initial reaction to ""Found footage Anthology"" or found footage in general? That should give you a bit of a clue, if you should watch this or not. One thing is for sure, if an Anthology movie is only as good as it's weakest link/story, than this would be really bad (the story covering the whole thing is tedious, boring and annoying at best)!

27 August 2012,brijs82-458-528496,6," Too much
","What we have in V/H/S are a bunch of prolonged horror moments that in 
 usual cases would be the climax to any average horror movie. The movie 
 manages to throw 5 of these 'money shots' at the viewer without the 
 need to tell any real story, build any of the characters or introduce 
 their personality's to the audience. Whether this is a stroke of genius 
 originality or just laziness is the question.
 
 You'd be forgiven for thinking that V/H/S is the result a brain 
 storming session where five writers pitched five stories, with one 
 'Eureka' moment of making a movie of the ending of all five. What they 
 seemingly failed to spend any real time on though was the glue to bind 
 the five stories together. It is completely irrelevant, in fact I would 
 go as far as to say the movie would be better without it, a ""Here are 
 five tapes that were found, now watch them"" instead.
 
 I have to say I am a fan of 'found footage movies'. To me they achieve 
 the desired effect and can, at times, create some truly chilling 
 moments. This movie does have it's moments but after a while it all 
 gets too much, the 'found footage' angle is somehow lost with the 
 constant change of story. You are never really allowed to reach the 
 same level of suspense as with other films in this genre.
 
 6/10. It passed the time but I eventually found myself wanting it to

Reading stimulates the imagination, triggers juxtapositions that make for new and interesting stories. Simply watching movies isn't enough: too many are too thoughtlessly cranked out with little or no imagination. (And television is even worse.)

","I never was a big fan of the so-called ""Found Footage"" horror trend, but  No wait, let me rephrase that. I absolutely loathe the vexatious trend of ""Found Footage"" horror that single-handedly contributes a great deal to the further decay of the genre in general! It may just be the humble opinion of one lousy and insignificant horror fanatic, but personally I think that found footage movies are the ideal format for aspiring directors that are untalented and largely incompetent, but nevertheless want to persist in entering the film industry. Found footage movies don't require a real plot, as you can link all the bizarre and inexplicable stuff to supernatural occurrences. Whenever the storyline is stuck or you don't have any budget to shoot a half-decent action sequence, you simply insert some shaky camera images with hysterical yelling in the background and the matter is resolved. Just don't watch them if you hate them so much, I hear you say? Fair point And I'm not watching any more of them, since basically every found footage horror flick is identical to either ""Paranormal Activity"" or ""Blair Witch Project"". I did make two final exceptions as I thought (or hoped) that they would be better and more original efforts, namely Barry Levinson's ""The Bay"" and this ""V/H/S"" assembled by a collective of young and reasonably talented directors.",/review/rw2784411/?ref_=tt_urv
