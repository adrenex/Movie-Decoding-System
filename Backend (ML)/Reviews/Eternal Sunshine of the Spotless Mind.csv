24 November 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," Absolutely wonderful
","When I first saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, I wasn't expecting to love it, let alone like it. What a surprise when I saw it! I think this film is wonderful in every aspect, truly beautiful and packs a full emotional punch. In fact, if you don't mind me saying so, it is one of my favourite films of the 2000s.",/review/rw3150869/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2004,Quinoa1984,10," an modern artistic triumph for all involved
","Michel Gondry, credited as the director and co-writer of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, is only partly responsible for the success that the film achieves. He implements a awe-inspiring blend of style to a story that is perfectly non-linear. But then there is also the madman genius of the current screen writing plane- Charlie Kaufman- who has written three of the most ingenious, funny, and human of ""little"" Hollywood movies (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind).

2 July 2004,Superunknovvn,10," Perfect - a movie that puts 99% of all contemporary movies to shame
","There's only one way to describe ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"": perfect. It's been one week since I saw the movie and I still cannot stop thinking about it. Was the ending happy or sad? I cannot tell, but it's deeply touching.",/review/rw3150869/?ref_=tt_urv

","Joel (Jim Carrey) is a rather milquetoast man who meets up with free spirit Clementine (Kate Winslet), and they become romantically involved. However, they endure a messy breakup and Clementine goes to a business called Lacuna, Inc., where she has all of her memories of Joel erased. Not wanting to be left out, Joel also goes to have his memory erased. However, soon after it begins, Joel realizes that he wants to keep the memory of Clementine, so he tries to reverse the process.",/review/rw3150869/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2004,JAKastner,9," The Moose Hole - Review of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
","It happens to both the best and worst of us at some time in our lives. Love . If you haven't experienced this yet just wait, you will. It is inevitable that at some time in our journey through life that we will come across someone that fascinates us so profoundly that we feel as though we could spend the rest of our lives with this magnetic individual. There is no exact science to the concept of love. Many believe that the idea of love goes beyond the reasonable or the logical to a more diverse level of the illogical, irrational, and the unreasonable. Why is it that we find ourselves attracted to people that, on the surface, seem as though they would never be compatible with our own lifestyle? Why is it that when we do fall in love with a certain individual and think at first that this is a perfect match, we find over time that less tolerable marks are more frequent on the surface? And why is it that we overlook some individuals that, although at first there is no real 'love connection' per say, we seem to have a somewhat pure liking for someone and that it takes us longer then it should to see that person for who they really are to us? Love is a complicated subject that can't be taught, it can only be experienced for what it is . utterly confusing and yet at the same time completely fulfilling.",/review/rw3150869/?ref_=tt_urv

","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the most well written movie since Pulp Fiction, and the best movie since the turn of the century. It's originality is unprecedented, putting screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Adaptation) up there with the greats.

","If you can relate to the underlying theme of love longed for, love given and received, and love lost, this is a great film. If you have come to understand that acceptance can -sometimes- be a great thing and not a compromise or a 'settle for' - this is a moving film.",/review/rw3150869/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2004,doctec,," Interior Landscape
","Of all Kaufman's screenplays that delve into the interior landscapes of its characters, Eternal Sunshine is the most fully formed and moving story of the bunch, a rumination on the possibilities and consequences inherent in making the process of removing unwanted memories from your consciousness as easy as going for a checkup.  Kaufman here plays on our desire to forget the bad things that happen to us and what happens when we are given the power to forget those things permanently, and the conclusion he arrives at is that it ultimately creates as many - if not more - problems than it solves.  At the very least, it can result in making the same mistakes again (""Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it""); at the worst, it eliminates the possibility of our ever reconciling and coming to terms with our life experiences, the way we relate to the people who help to shape our lives and whose lives we shape through ours.",/review/rw3150869/?ref_=tt_urv

","Here's the basic plot. Clemintine and Joel have a long, rocky relationship. Clemintine decides to get Joel erased from her memory, so Joel decides to do the same, only while Joel is in the process of the erasing, he comes back around to the really sweet, nice memories, and realizes that he wants out of the procedure.

19 September 2010,AlsExGal,10," Absolute power corrupts absolutely
","This film has both Jim Carrey and Kate Winsett playing roles that you are probably unaccustomed to seeing them in. Jim Carrey plays plain-vanilla introvert Joel and Winsett plays extroverted salesgirl Clementine who likes to express herself by dying her hair an odd combination of colors and dressing up potatoes like Barbie Dolls. At the time he meets Clementine, Joel is living with someone named Naomi that he mentions several times during the film in only positive terms as ""very nice"". Joel must be searching for something other than ""very nice"" since this doesn't prevent him from throwing over this woman that the audience never sees for the unpredictable unknown quantity, Clementine. However, eventually the relationship ends so badly for this mismatched couple that Clementine has all memory of their relationship erased from her mind by a company that has the technology to provide such a service.",/review/rw3150869/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2004,DonFishies,10," Simply brilliant in all dimensions of the word
","I had no idea what Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was about until the end of March. I had heard some small rumblings about it around the Internet for a few months, and also saw a few short TV trailers for it, but that was about it. Basically, all I knew was it was another dramatic Jim Carrey film, written by the same guy who wrote two of the weirdest and somehow great films to come out in a long time, Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. But does this film succeed to be just as weird yet excellent as the other two? Or is it even better? A big yes on both counts would be highly appropriate.",/review/rw3150869/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2005,nycritic,10," Would You Erase Your Mind to Kill the Heart?

10 March 2011,Tweekums,8," An interesting sci-fi romance with a difference
","Usually when I sit down to watch a Jim Carrey film I end up getting a little irritated by his excessive gurning; thankfully there is none of that here. Carrey plays Joel Barish a man who decides to skip work one day and takes the train to Montauk where he takes a walk on the beach, later he meets Clementine, a girl with bright blue hair who he gets talking to on the way home. He offers to take her home and then something strange happens he goes to see her at the shop she works in and she acts as if she doesn't recognise him and later he is told that she has had all memories of him clinically erased! He goes to the clinic and after learning as much as they are free to tell him decides to have all memories of her erased too. Things then get rather complicated as he relives various moments in an apparently long relationship as they are deleted, during the procedure he realises that he doesn't want to forget her and tries to find a way of protecting at least one memory of her. Meanwhile the people erasing his memories are having their own problems; one of them is trying to seduce Clementine himself and while he is off the other loses Joel so must call in his boss which in tern leads to more secrets being exposed.",/review/rw3150869/?ref_=tt_urv

20 October 2019,nicholls905-280-546911,10," Incredible
","Easily one of the best films from 2004. Kaufman and Gondry are at the height of their skills and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a highlight on their resume. Carrey carries incredible restraint here, but Winslet is one of a kind. Great film that deserved more attention.",/review/rw3150869/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2006,Lady_Targaryen,9," You can erase someone from your mind. Getting them out of your heart is another story
","''Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'' is a big and strange name, but it matches perfectly this movie. I can say this is one of my favorite films at all, and one of the things that makes it so special to me, is the fact that it can be interpreted in multiple ways. Jim Carrey finally has a serious role and Kate Winslet is great as Clementine, the very extroverted girl with the most hair varieties you can imagine. (It is different from the British girl characters she is used to play)",/review/rw3150869/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2019,acedj,8," Jim Carrey show a serious side
","This movie is a deep dark look at loss and regret, and the desire to forget forever the things that cause us deep emotional anguish. Jim and Kate play a couple that had a rough break up, despite the fact that they were deeply in love. Jim goes to a company that will come into your house, and while you sleep seek out and destroy painful memories. What makes this interesting, well there are many things that make this movie interesting, but what really stands out is the way that Jim's character struggles within himself to hold on to the memories he so wanted erased initially. This movie is a sobering look at the thing that makes us what we are, our choices and the pain or reward that they bring. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet do a phenomenal job in this movie.",/review/rw3150869/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2006,Hitchcoc,8," Real Food for Thought
","This is a real mind bender (no pun intended). I really liked the premise because it opens up great implications for us all. How far are we from the manipulation of specific brain centers? We can already do a fair amount. The reality is that even if one can erase memories, we can't curtail the ""butterfly effect ""of our actions. We have trod the earth and the small or large changes we inspire, create something new. Now project love and romance, and, given time, let it percolate. You have Jim Carry and Kate Winslet being ""forced"" back together because despite their minds, they never left. And if the memories were inconsequential in the larger picture, their remnants will continue to influence. Pretty thought provoking. We are more than our memories--we are part of the entire picture.",/review/rw3150869/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2014,The-Sarkologist,9," To forget is not always the easiest solution
","It took me a little while to work this movie out because it was a little odd at the beginning. Okay, I knew it was about how a man (Joel) was having all memory of his ex-girlfriend (Clementine) erased from his memory, and that it is basically a love story in reverse, but as I said the beginning left me a little baffled. Basically Joel goes to the beach and meets Clementine and they begin to hit it off and after their first date he parks outside her house so she can get her toothbrush and some guy comes up to him and asks him what he is doing. Suddenly it jumps to a scene where he is driving home crying, and for a while I thought there was a sudden jump of two years to when they had broken up. When, later on in the movie, the scene where they first met was completely different to the opening scenes of the movie I was under the impression that there was a huge continually stuff up. However, how can a movie, with a huge continually stuff up, get a rating of over 8 on IMDb? Well, all is explained in the end.",/review/rw3150869/?ref_=tt_urv
