19 July 2021,AvidWatcher101,3," My rating drops with season 3
","Is there a contest going on to see which character can be the most annoying? If there is, Mel wins, hands down. She was the brave plucky nurse, moving to the small town, opening her heart, making a difference.. now she creates problems, creates unnecessary drama in her relationship, constantly feels sorry for herself - for the same issues she spent season one overcoming - and showing us that yes, you can get up again and make a life and be happy - but no.. now we cry and wallow and OMG I am at ep 9 and I think I'll have to skip to the end of the finale because I can't take anymore. The lead character who could be admired is now just annoying.",/review/rw5348607/?ref_=tt_urv

30 November 2020,apryla-58795,8," GET RID OF CHARMAINE!
",Love this show BUT they have to kill Charmaine off in childbirth. She is soooooo annoying! She has no claim to Jack yet she's acting like his wife or girlfriend. He needs to tell her to shut it! Her whining and complaining and neediness is majorly annoying and grating! It's not just that she's a problem for Jack and Mel it's that she's a problem for the show. She's just a major Beyotch!! She's complaining about him not being trustworthy when he does not owe her anything! He's showing up way more than he is obligated to and she's still being a major pain in the a@@! What a piece of work!,/review/rw5348607/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2021,tlutzy,5," Loved season1, tolerated season 2, season 3 is terrible
","We really enjoyed season 1 and became invested in the characters. We eagerly waited for season 2 and enjoyed it, for the most part, but some of the plot twists were starting to feel contrived and Charmaine's character was increasingly unbelievable (she has never looked pregnant) not to mention annoying. But we tuned in to season 3 right when it was available and were so turned off by the first episode that we are not going to continue. Again, the character of Charmaine is totally unbelievable -- engaged after three weeks? Still not showing? Come on. The sudden fire at Jack's house is also completely unbelievable in this day and age of mandatory smoke detectors (especially in California!) that would have gone off and warned them well before any fire could have developed as far as it did. We're disappointed in the decline in quality because we really wanted to like it. And the acting is pretty good, especially Alexandra Breckenridge, Martin Henderson, Colin Lawrence and Tim Matheson. But there are so many better shows out there now that we just aren't going to invest any more time in Virgin River.",/review/rw5348607/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2019,siesha,8," Enjoyed it more than I thought I would
","As a Hart of Dixie fan, I was a little worried based on some of the reviews. Turns out it was unfounded. The only similarities are that it happens to be based in a small town, the protagonist moves there to start over and the doctor is played by the same actor. It's a completely different story line, its dramatic and its darker. I'm happy I gave it a chance. You should too!",/review/rw5348607/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2019,egeferentino9,9," Cute Show to binge!
",This show reminds me of Heart of Dixie. Of course with a few changes. Just started watching it so far I like what I'm watching! Give this show a chance a cute little gem!,/review/rw5348607/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2020,cheerio-77065,9," Loving the Season 2 so far, but...
","I'm glad it's back, but why does Charmaine have to be this annoying? This is too much. Sometimes I even gotta take a break because she can be so annoying.",/review/rw5348607/?ref_=tt_urv

21 July 2021,rdmceagles,5," what happened???
","OK first 2 seasons were ok kind of sappy and silly plot lines but still likeable. The whole Charmaine being ""pregnant"" thing is getting on my last nerve. This magical twin pregnancy and by season 3 she doesn't even look pregnant at all??? Plus she conveniently meets some rich guy and bang she's engaged??? Anyway the addition of the idiotic Ricky story line with Lizzie is literally making me want to vomit. They didn't have enough story lines out there and had to throw in 2 young kids and their drama??? I'm tempted to go right to the last episode and just see what happens to put myself out of my misery.",/review/rw5348607/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2019,ellelldee,6," Innocuous entertainment
","During a recent illness, I was laid up for several weeks, and this was a pleasant, undemanding way of passing the time. It made zero demands on me. Annette O'Toole is always a pleasure to watch, even if her character is annoying. This is an actress who has never gotten the credit she deserves. The men are handsome in non-threatening ways. The heroine is pretty and smart, but not too pretty, and not too smart. It's like a Harlequin romance for TV.",/review/rw5348607/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2019,hayley96,2," Slow, boring predictable
","From the first line of dialogue, this show reeks. Apparently no one producing this watched Northern Exposure. The local crumudegon, the ditzy daughter if the local crumudegon. The cabin that's a joke. None of it rings true.",/review/rw5348607/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2019,juliekcreel,3," No Cliche Left Unturned
","I had high hopes for this series, and the first couple of episodes were promising. By the 5th episode, however, it was apparent that the writers were happy with churning drama out of the same old cliches we've seen a hundred times. Gun toting pot growers take the main character hostage to treat their injured leader? Really? While at the camp, a young woman just happens to be in active labor - breach birth, no less - so the heroine can save her as well? Really? I watched another episode, just to see if it improved. No such luck.",/review/rw5348607/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2020,smasonnc,2," You've gotta be kidding.
","I gave it two stars because a couple of the actors aren't egregiously bad and the scenery is beautiful, but this is very well-trod territory. Hackneyed characters talk in cliches and act in non-sensical ways. Three of the leads are OK, but the supporting actors come from the Pia Zadora Academy of Dramatic Arts. They recite their lines like Miss America discussing world peace.",/review/rw5348607/?ref_=tt_urv

10 July 2021,doriansansbury,5," Kill Hope...
",Been watching the series when i'm tired as it is kind of cheesy and brainless entertainment and Mel is cute. But damn since the 1st min i SAW Hope i hated that character and on top of that couldn't the doctor do better then a xxxxx like her. Crossing my fingers she would die in the storm she is in in S3 and if she survives she must definetely be killed by a giant wild Moose or something that eats her alive. Never saw a more annoying character in a series ever.,/review/rw5348607/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2021,mikejade,4," Watching S2 E9
","I'm just about done with this series. The story has gone way downhill from the start. Way too much drama. Too much like a daytime soap opera. Hope has become way more annoying. Charmaine has as well. People making dumb decisions. So if you start it, imo, be prepared for a rough ride in S2. Good luck. I'm not sure how much longer. The acting is pretty good. I blame the writing. I'm not used to watching soapy dramas.",/review/rw5348607/?ref_=tt_urv

7 December 2019,crystle0713,10," Never read the books

9 December 2019,bshaef,1," Uniformly
","Bad acting, story and music. Would have been perfect for a soap opera. Netflix blew it on this unless they have algorhythm that says series like this are a hit with a big enough per centage of the population to make a few every year. Scenery was nice though.",/review/rw5348607/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2019,krisztinaobrien,6," Very predictable nothing special
","It is for those whom like long winded series's about small UsA town communities, the storyline is very predictable so there is nothing unexpected in the end. They crammed most soap cliches in Season 1 so its hard to see how this story can develop into something memorable. The main characters are great actors, though i think the slow burning attraction should have been better developed over a few seasons, the rush killed the chemistry. Some of the supporting characters not just bad actors but downright annoying, so much so that we reached for the fast forward button.",/review/rw5348607/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2021,grafengestrom-96222,1," Absurdly Clichéd Soap Opera Masking as a TV Series
","Virgin River makes the worst Hallmark Hall of Fame TV movies seem like Ingmar Bergman masterpieces. Contrived plotting, poor acting, and scenes that compare unfavorably to those found in Tele Novelas - this is the impression one gets from watching one of the worst series to appear on Netflix. Despite strong performances from the leads - Alexandra Breckenridge as Mel, Martin Henderson as Jack 0 Virgin River is maddeningly irritating from one episode to the next with plot twists that invite projectile vomiting.",/review/rw5348607/?ref_=tt_urv
