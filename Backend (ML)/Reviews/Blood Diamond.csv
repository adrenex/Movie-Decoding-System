5 March 2022,RogerBorg,6," Anthologies by their nature can't please all the viewers, all the time
","The core strength of an anthology show is that it can deliver a different flavour each episode. However, they usually come from the same complimentary palette.",/review/rw7932246/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2022,cerelacholmes,6," Dark and Violent but is that enough?
",Diabolical is a collection of random short animated content set in the universe of The Boys. We get to see some actual characters from The Boys which was an actual surprise ( I hadn't seen any trailers before ) and there are some Easter eggs which are good. Episode 03 and 08 were bangers because of Homelander and Billy Butcher. Other episodes were average at best. This is how I'd rate the episodes :,/review/rw7932246/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,Tweekums,8," The Boys Presents: Diabolical
","This animated spin off from 'The Boys' features eight ten minute episodes, each of which tells a complete little story. The stories vary in style and tone but it is safe to say none are suitable for younger viewers thanks to the level of extremely gory violence and robust language. It is set in the same universe as 'The Boys' so it is likely to appeal most to people who have seen and enjoyed that... while many things can be enjoyed by new viewers it wastes no time re-introducing familiar characters.",/review/rw7932246/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,alindsayal,4," A Below Average Let Down of a Spinoff
",I am a big fan of Amazon's show The Boys and now they have released a spinoff anthology animated show called Diabolical. I watched through it all today and here is my review for it. The premise of the show looks at 8 original stories that fit the tone of The Boys and features some of their characters.,/review/rw7932246/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2022,trimblair,2," Trash cartoons
","Get really high, write a dozen bad ideas, get them produced because you are piggybacking on a successful TV show .. and push this disappointment out. Soooo bad. Just unwatchable trash.",/review/rw7932246/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,iamjamalwhite,2," not enough weed
","Simon Pegg and Seth Rogan got really high and these are the ideas that were not produced anywhere else. The success of ""THE BOYS"" makes this marketable. One episode about the live poop was the worst 15 minutes of my life and I lost brain cells just watching it. These guys have attached themselves to super hero stuff and should not be. They are the worst of us and I am less of a person for watching the eight short cartoons.",/review/rw7932246/?ref_=tt_urv

8 March 2022,stevebondi,7," No where near as good as The Boys series, but still pretty good :-)
","Irreverent, bloody, violent humor like The Boys series, but amped up a bit with animation. It is focused on getting quick laughs with its short stories, so it is mostly missing the non-comedic heart that The Boys series has.",/review/rw7932246/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2022,wick27,2," Love The Boys but hated this trash.....
",Episode 1 was a waste of about 14 minutes of my life. Zero on the 1-10 scale. I am not sure WHY these were even made except to just make money off The Boys franchise. Granted I am not a fan of graphic cartoon violence but these were ONLY created to advance the genre thru employing children as the slaughter machines. Saw nothing thru the first 4 episodes to warrant saying anything positive about this trash.,/review/rw7932246/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2022,On_The_Mark,6," Some good, some awful
","I really like a couple of these. I like the concept too. Each episode is done in a different style by different people. I thought the Looney Tunes one was pretty good. There were a couple others that were good, a couple watchable and a couple just awful.",/review/rw7932246/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2022,zwjonas,4," What a disappointment
","The boys TV seasons both one and two are amazing and probably my favorite TV show. I love animation action and animation comedy. But there is no other way to say it this show is horrible. The voice acting is fine. The animation is average at best. The storytelling, characters, dialogue are awful. It's smothered in senseless violence and gore with no purpose and no actual storytelling. I don't mind the gore if it would actually serve any sort of purpose besides just some sort of failed shock value that doesn't contribute to a story at all. So sad to see this big failure. The IP alone should have carried it to at least a seven out of ten. Can't believe they goofed it up this bad. I struggled to get through it and I was super excited about it.",/review/rw7932246/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2022,PurpleCrayon2014,1," This Is Some Serious Garbage
","This is material for the pre-adolescent 13 year olds of the 21st Century. Seth Rogan seems to talk the talk with executives who know no better than the average fan, but his recent career has shown he certainly can't walk the walk. Garth Ennis is a comic writer and is not expected to know how to take his writings and turn them into a quality production. The production of Diabolical tarnishes greatly the image of production of The Boys. Yes, the concept on paper was fun to fantasize about but the end product results in what I can produce from eating too much Taco Bell.",/review/rw7932246/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2022,seige-hound,7," A fun anthology loosly based on The Boys universe
","I think the people who found this show bad perhaps had the wrong expectations. This show isn't canon, it's just an excuse for various animation studios and directors to make their own spin based on the rules of The Boys universe.",/review/rw7932246/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2022,bbevis-47954,5," Not My Thing
",Not all episodes were bad and I giggled a few times here and there. I would prefer a live-action spin off of the boys rather than an aminated anthology. With anthologie series there are bound to be some turds. I'm referring to the episode with literal ðŸ’©. I cam see people enjoying the different animation styles and a few episodes. The diabolical is not for me.,/review/rw7932246/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2022,Constantine306,4," Pointless
","Watched this with a group of fans of the show snd a comics and no one walked away happy. Unless the 8th episode actually ties to the series this was completely pointless. An anthology of different ""What If"" fan fiction stories set in The Boys universe with different animation styles. Some entertaining things happen here and there which can make you think, ""ok, maybe the next one will be good."" Unfortunately you're more likely to ask, ""what did I just watch and can I get a refund on my life I just wasted watching this dribble?"" If you're going to watch it, do yourself a favor and only watch episodes 3 and 8. That's the most entertainment you're going to get out of this.",/review/rw7932246/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2022,lathrael,6," Entertaining but...
","It's nowhere near the quality of either Boys or Invincible. Some episodes are entertaining but gore seems to be only thing it is going for. There is no plot, every episode is another story and... Just give us The Boys. Or another Vought newsletter. That was really unnecessary.",/review/rw7932246/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2022,lucasj007,2," Complete Garbage
","This series might be in the universe of ""The Boys,"" but it is seriously lacking. The only eps worth watching is EPS 3. The writers must have been high school dropouts, because these shorts were idiotic. The art on some of them showed promise but the story killed any hope of making it good. I hope this isn't a prelude as to what is to come for the series. It's crap like this that makes me want to cancel my Amazon Prime.",/review/rw7932246/?ref_=tt_urv

","Like i can't think of anybody that really would like this... i originally gave this a 2 but upped it to 4 cuz im a fan of the boyz show. But really ego enjoys a show very similarly to looney tunes only it's not for kids... its kinda too weird... ima prolly watch the rest of it just to see if i need to lower my rating or keep it the same lol. And i will Never watch it all in one day, don't wanna waste my time like that on this one.",/review/rw7932246/?ref_=tt_urv

","Got like 7 minutes into one episode. It's like watching a corny 90s cartoon. Super cheesy animations. Seemed like the longest 7 minutes of my life.
