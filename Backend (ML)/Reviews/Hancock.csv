16 February 2006,iKramerica-1,8," A fun movie, and let's clear up a few things...
","I really enjoyed this movie. I expected the worst because of many of the comments here, but that's why they play the game, so the saying goes...",/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2006,Victor Field,3," Not to be confused with the one and only, truly original, panther pink panther from head to toes.
","I can see how this take on ""The Pink Panther"" has failed to be the box office disaster many have hoped it would be - it never pretends to be anything other than pure slapstick from beginning to end, which is no bad thing for a comedy. The trouble is, it's pretty BAD slapstick, rendering this ""re-imagining"" (with thanks to Tim Burton's problematic but slightly underrated ""Planet of the Apes"") somewhat pointless, and another misstep on the CV of inexplicably employable producer Robert Simonds and director Shaun Levy.",/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2007,tedg,," Humbhga
","The joke has always been simple: the French are ridiculous people, and among them their police are especially comical. This idea was only embellished by the amazing Peter Sellers. The music, generous slapstick and for the times, beautiful, suggestive women added enough to the formula to make it work. Or at least sell tickets.",/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2006,DICK STEEL,7," A Nutshell Review: The Pink Panther
","The Pink Panther actually refers to an enormous pink diamond with a flaw in the shape of a panther, and not to Inspector Jacques Clouseau, but because of the iconic pink panther's appearance in the animated opening credits, along with the all too familiar theme by Henry Mancini, it's all too easy to associate one with the other.",/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2006,bonehead,5," Not quite what I'd hoped for ...
","I'm rather surprised at the outpouring of positive commentary about this movie, especially by folks who are older than ten or so.",/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2006,acs_joel,1," The Stink Panther
",Hollywood decision-makers have either no brains or no b#%*s -- or both. The Stink Panther is yet another example of a remake gone south. It takes such gall to defile a classic like The Pink Panther.,/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2006,SoncoChairman,1," An Insult to the Series
","From the beginning I knew a prequel to the PINK PANTHER series would be an abomination. I did not, however, think it would be worse than I expected. I went to see the movie because I am a fan of Steve Martin and his writing. His attempt at either imitating or recreating the Clouseau role (whichever it was) was, in the very least, a failed accomplishment. The beauty of the Sellers ""Clouseau"" was the subtlety that Sellers brought to the character. He was clumsy as opposed to stupid. The real humor in the originals is that Clouseau would solve the case, more or less, by accident through his faults. Thus when he received acclaim it was that much more humorous. Martin's ""Clouseau"" is stupid and vain and has no likable traits. He actually has some police skills that help him in the end, but are not in the vain of Clouseau. He is NOT Clouseau. Why would anyone want to recreate a character that was perfect? Some may say to introduce the series to a new generation. I say buy the DVDs. They are well worth the investment. There is one good scene in the film, which revolves around a cameo by Clive Owen. Granted the scene contains inside jokes but if you get them then you'll laugh. However the scene has nothing to do with the story of the film and Steve Martin should be ashamed of himself for writing such rubbish. The bottom line Peter Sellers must turning over in his grave, but I am sure he's glad he is dead so he does not have to see his legacy damaged.",/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2006,Vaseal,1," Why isn't Steve Martin funny anymore?
","I really don't understand Steve Martin!! First he tries dismally to revive the late great Phil Silvers character ""Sergeant Bilko"" and now he also has tried to revive equally dismally the late great Peter Sellers character ""inspector Jacques Clouseau"".",/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2006,imdb1,2," Boring, boring, boring.
","This movie is proof that the previous inspector Clouseau movies were entirely carried by the genius of Peter Sellers. Having a different actor play the role of Clouseau could never work, unless the _exact_ way of behavior invented by Peter Sellers would have been copied. I would have thought that that would be impossible, if it weren't for the fact that I saw 'The Life and Death of Peter Sellers (2004)', a documentary about Peter Sellers, where Geoffrey Rush managed to put down his character in a near perfect imitation. Therefore we have to at least partly blame Steve Martin for the fact that each and every scene where he plays the clumsy inspector, no doubt with the intention to be funny, is an embarrassment to watch. If you never saw any previous pink panther movies, you might think this movie is funny; yet, don't waste your time on it. Watch the original with Peter Sellers and feel the pain in your stomach and jaws while tears are flowing down your cheeks from laughing, instead.",/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2006,SylvesterFox007,10," A Completely Different Panther
","Peter Sellers was Peter Sellers. Steve Martin is Steve Martin. In the same way, Steve Martin's Inspector Jacques Clouseau is a totally new creation, as uniquely Martin's as the original was uniquely Sellers'. The essential details are the same: the ridiculous accent, the unique level of incompetence, the tendency to karate-chop the air on reflex. But instead of trying to emulate Sellers, Martin fills out the character with his unique brand of goofiness. By the end of the movie, I had totally accepted Steve Martin as the new Inspector Clouseau, never once trying to compare him to Peter Sellers.",/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2006,olehenry1,2," even with an open mind, I came away deeply disappointed
","I saw a preview 2 weeks before and was extremely excited to see this movie. I had seen Sellers in the Return and Revenge movies as a youngster and thought Steve Martin could easily pull this roll off! I am a hugemongous fan of his old stuff (Jerk, ...Plaid, All of Me, Man with two.... etc.)!",/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2006,nobbytatoes,2," they should have left it alone
","At a massive football game of France vs China, Yves Gluant, coach of France's team, is murdered in front of everyone with the pink panther diamond Yves was wearing now missing. Chief Inspector Dreyfus jumps to the case, hoping to boost his dwindling image. Dreyfus comes to an idea of hiring a incompetent policeman to keep the medias attention of him; that policeman, Inspector Jacques Clouseau. Clouseau is teamed up with Gendarme Gilbert Ponton, to keep tabs on Cloaseau for Dreyfus, and his secretary Nicole, with sparks about to fly between them. Main suspect for the murder is Xania, Yves girlfriend and massive pop star singer.",/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2006,christian123,1," Lame kids film lacks laughs.
","The famous Pink Panther diamond has been stolen once again, this time from the ring of a murdered world-famous soccer coach. Once again called upon to crack the case, inspector Jacques Clouseau (Steve Martin) must try to retrieve the diamond, although his bumbling incompetence might make it a bit harder.

14 February 2006,PWNYCNY,9," Very funny movie.
","If this movie doesn't make you laugh, then you're devoid of any sense of humor. This is Steve Martin's funniest movie in years. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is the king of Hollywood comic actors. And Beyonce is wonderful. And the movie is silly and corny and contrived, which is to be expected for a comedy. And although Inspector Clouseau is a buffoon, he's really likable. The airport scene and the good cop/bad cop scene are hilarious, especially when the Inspector demonstrates an interrogation device - on himself. At times the humor is crude, but remember, it's a comedy, so instead of being critical, why not just enjoy the movie and have some laughs.",/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2006,punk_NYC,1," A lot less than I expected
","I expected this movie to be really good but instead I was disappointed with the boring performance by all the actors in this movie it was just dull and pointless, the story went nowhere and for me it was not even that funny at all! The only funny part was the hamburger part where he's trying to say the word with an American accent but that was shown in the commercials so much that it ruined it for the movie! Steve Martin has done so much better in his other movies such as Cheaper By The Dozen that this was such a let down! I don't recommend watching this you'll only walk out of the theater yawning! I give it a 1/10! Not to mention how boring Beyonce was and then it all ends up being some professional trainer guy who steals the diamond, i'd be better off watching the cartoon at home!",/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2006,batpickle,1," The Stink Panther!!!
","P-U this movie is one big stinker!!! How could anyone like this piece of garbage! Steve Martin is horrible as Inspector Jacques Clouseau, and could quite possibly take away the title for worst accents from Kevin Costner! I mean really Peter Sellers was a genius and that part was made for him but if Steve Martin can't do a French accent then get someone else! He tried to cover his lack of ability by pronouncing his ""r's"" as ""w's"" and it came out sounding like baby talk! Moderized gags and crappy jokes lead this stink bomb straight to the sewer. I took my kids to see this and they were not even impressed in the least and they are 15 and 10 years old! Don't waste your money seeing this in the theater, don't buy the DVD until it hits the $5.00 bin that way it won't cost much more than renting it and you can burn your copy after watching it that way you will get some satisfaction!",/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2006,heifer-1,8," Well worth watching
","Don't be swayed by some of the negative reviews. This movie is entertaining, and fun to watch. As has been noted in other posts, Martin is not Sellers, and Kline is not Lom. But you already know that. That being said, Steve Martin puts his own spin on the character, and most of the time it worked quite well. If you remember, the original Pink Panther was made in '63, A Shot in the Dark was in '64, and it was 12 years before the next one with Sellers was made. And during that time, Alan Arkin played Clouseau. So, Sellers playing the inspector wasn't an instant classic, and took over a decade to catch on enough to make sequels.",/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2006,jluis1984,7," A nice surprise!
","The ""Pink Panther"" movies, are without a doubt classics of slapstick comedy taken to perfection thanks to the talents of Blake Edwards, Heny Mancini and the legendary Peter Sellers. With that said, it was obvious that when a remake was announced, the world was shocked; and the shock was greater when Steve Martin was announced to star in the role that Sellers made famous, the Instepctor Jaques Clouseau.",/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2006,contact_paul,1," Junk
","I can safely write the shorts review ever for this... It is Junk, a poor representation of the original genius. Avoid this film, don't give the makers any incentive to make similar movies again.",/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2006,theshadow908,7," Hilarious twist on the classic film.
","I'd just like to say that I've noticed that everyone that bashes this film is a die hard fan of the original and Peter Sellers. I like the original film, but you have to understand that the makers of this film and Steve Martin are trying to put their own twist on the story, not insult the original. If you go in there and just force yourself to think of how much better the original is, you're not going to like it. If you realize it's a new movie with a fresh twist, you'll like it.",/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2006,g.barlas,1," Horrible!
","What a waste of time and talent...... Kline, Martin, Reno... They should have known better, considering their age, talent and somewhat rich past. In this new Panther NOTHING works! Everything is SO mediocre and banal.... Sad to see Martin finally sank to fart jokes! Y'know the rest.... It gives one goose-pimples just to hear the actors speaking in English with Frech accents! There is also this very embarrassing scene where Closeau tries to learn the right pronunciations.... Man, c'est horrible! Why do they churn out such idiotic films in nowadays Hollywood? Do they have no talent left or do they think we the audience such stupid mushrooms????? Avoid at any cost!",/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2006,jessie-39,9," A whole new franchise..Steve Martin fantastic!
","We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.",/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2007,fedor8,," Steve Martin is as French as Casey Affleck is a stud.
","Can anyone remember the last movie in which Steve Martin was funny? Considering (t)his negative recent track record, the LAST thing he should have agreed to was to play Clouseau. When I heard about him being cast in this film, I almost got a laughing fit - and that was the funniest thing about this movie. Nothing I saw in the movie itself could come even close to matching that bit of comedy. Martin isn't even remotely French-looking. He already made an ""ethnic casting mistake"" once, when he agreed to play an Italian gangster (!!) in ""My Blue Heaven"", an unfunny comedy, so one would think that a man as intelligent as Martin would avoid screwing up the same way again. (Well, ""intelligent"" as in more intelligent than most other actors, who are mostly morons, of course.)",/review/rw1743999/?ref_=tt_urv
