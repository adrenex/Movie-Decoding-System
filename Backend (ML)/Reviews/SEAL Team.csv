9 October 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Good show about Navy Seals!
","Seal Team is a military themed show about family, drama, loyalty and war. It's has every realistic plots that really draw you in and make you care about the characters in this show. You can tell they use real military guys as consultants. David Boreanaz carries the show on probably his best acting performance to date. That's saying something to becomes been on a lot of good shows. A. J Buckley and Max Thieriot also both give breakout performance here. It's one of the best military shows I've seen and shows just a glimpse of what these heroes have to go through in real life. Definitely a show that's worth watching.",/review/rw7364653/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Entertaining!
","Seal Team is one of the better shows about Navy Seals that I have ever seen! Once I started watching this I literally couldn't stop. I thought it would be like any other CBS procedural show (some are pretty good) but it's not, it's so much better. It's about the lives of Navy Seals both during action and at home. They show how they train, plan and execute dangerous missions for the United States and the consequences that come with it. Every episode is worth watching and action packed! Even though it got moved to Paramount Plus after season 4 I'm still glad it got renewed for more seasons because it absolutely deserves it!",/review/rw7364653/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2022,Caln19,8," Excellent show
","Give it more than 1-2 episodes because it takes time to get into it. It isn't only mindless action, characters have depth and the plot is interesting, some episodes feel like a whole movie which is really nice.",/review/rw7364653/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2021,kapurkimaya,9," Brock and Trent
",Give Brock and Trent some more screen time and importance. I know they're not main actors but they've been on this show from the start and they're good characters and actors on this show. I'd like to see them be given more role.,/review/rw7364653/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2017,timmurphy-2,9," Solid Show
","Look...no network TV show is going to be totally accurate. This isn't a documentary. I was a JAG and that TV show wasn't even close to being accurate. But it WAS entertaining. And, like this show, it captures the spirit and fellowship of a tight military team. Whoever these folks are dissing the show I have news for you...women play vital roles in our armed services. The contribution here is fairly accurate from what I understand. This is entertaining, it's patriotic and it honors the men and women in the front lines of the war on terror. I also appreciate that it attempts to highlight the sacrifices of the family members supporting our servicemen and servicewomen. As a veteran and the father of two servicemen, I thank CBS for a pretty solid and interesting show. Thanks for honoring the best America has to offer.",/review/rw7364653/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2021,cptcap,10," One of the best military shows ever made.
","It's actually directed by real veterans and alot of the actors have served, some are even real Navy seals like the character ''Full metal''. They try more than any other military show I've seen to make it as realistic as possible, showing the viewers how it is to be a Navy seal and how their lifes are outside of the military.",/review/rw7364653/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2022,bitbucketchip,8," Good show
","I can't speak to the accuracy of the action, but it feels realistic. They occasionally clear a room with a sniper rifle, and suppressed weapons seem too silent(?), but nothing there's nothing that takes you out of the action.",/review/rw7364653/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2019,melsmelanosite,10," The Best Military Show Ever
","I am a former Special Forces detachment CDR, and I am just thrilled to see this show.
In fact, I don't even like watching TV because it is so superficial sometimes. But this is a must see for everyone at all ages.
The details remind me of so many things, down to the cages that look a bit bigger than ours for storing gear and stuff, and the absolutely normal looking CIA gal which is so true to reality. And so much smarter than everyone else !
Even the fast chats of some of the lines that a few reviewers found too fast to understand, is actually true to life. A lot of military people are fast talkers. They think they sound smart if they can say things real fast. That is the culture.
But as true as the writing is and as close as the settings and actions are to reality, the feel of the show is the real gem.
As an audience we feel what they feel, especially losing people from our lives who gave up on us. This includes the almost automatic drive to jump up and get to duty that is so common in those who act from dedication to this country and saving lives.
One of the reviewers said it is good mindless fun. Its okay to not see further than that. It is just fun for some. Not everyone comes to dinner for the same thing.
Not everyone wants to take the oath and do the dance, and run the North Island obstacle course over and over until it works.
Not everyone wants to feel what it means to really care about putting away bad people to protect good people.
But for those who want to know more, this shows what it is like to be a quiet patriot.
It shows love of country and family and brotherhood without forcing watchers to put sand in their mouths and wave American flags.
And it really does touch on things going on today in each of those countries.
It is not all Hollywood. I did the jumps from the C17s. It is cold up there. But some people do jump a little exposed at times. Not everyone covers everything exposed perfectly on every jump.
I thank you for reminding me who I am. What a gift you give to anyone who will just watch !
I think when this show stops its run which I hope is a long time from now, each of you involved will remember this as one of the most important projects of your lives. And each of the actors is so good that none of it looks like acting.
I salute you all for an incredible job well done.
I don't think any other military show can ever come close to this one.",/review/rw7364653/?ref_=tt_urv

1 November 2018,lizwjesus7,10," Love this series
","I spent 26 yrs as a wife of a military man. God bless him. He's been gone almost 4 yrs now. This show brings him back to me on so many levels. Thank you for bring this series to us. Even though I cry a lot watching it, I will not miss a single episode. Every character is someone I have known.",/review/rw7364653/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2022,blynn-76504,10," Awesome TV Drama
","I just wrapped up watching season 6 episode 8 and I was floored. I knew it was coming, I wished it was going to end on a happy solution, it was predictable and utterly awesome! To elicit an emotional response through script and acting is the goal of film. I have to say all of the characters combine to make the team. When one is taken out of the script, it leaves a lasting impact on the way I see the show. I have to applaud the writers and the director, you never know who is going to leave the show. If you are looking for a model for a TV series, this is definitely the one. I am not sure there will be a season 7, if so I will be willing to watch, and if not I will watch the series over again.",/review/rw7364653/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2021,Chris_Mac_25,10," This is how hiring suitably qualified consultants pays off

9 December 2021,petemac-25238,6," Complaints about language
","Are you kidding me? The dialogue is so much better since the change to an M rating. People complaining about it not being family friendly because of a few f-bombs? So seeing people blown up and shot is family friendly, give me a break. Does anyone think there's no swearing in combat?",/review/rw7364653/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2018,npvarley,10," Great entertainment!
","Ok, first up, there are a lot of people dissing this show for accuracy reasons who, I will bet, have never served a day in their entire lives. I wasn't a SEAL, or even Navy, but I did serve in Armor back in the 80s, before later becoming a cop (lieutenant, detective) in civilian life.",/review/rw7364653/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2020,refordgarry,8," Good action hero stuff.
","First 6 episodes were like a pilot, a bit trite, reminiscent of kid's TV. However the paychecks obviously got signed after that, since from stand-alone episodes we thence found ourselves in a good ole serialized war-drama. In those 22 episodes the audience got dragged a long distance, in terms of both intensity, plot and character development. One of the most impressive things about Seals is its ability to morph and evolve, with writers' ears tuned towards audience. Well Done!",/review/rw7364653/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2018,mozzis,8," This is the best...
","...of the military-themed shows out there this season. Sure, Boreanaz was a bit wooden at the series' beginning, and sure, a lot of it is predictable. But Jace's emotions have really started to come through as story has progressed, and the plots are getting tighter as well. Above and beyond all of this, the characters and their interactions have an authenticity that is better than The Brave or even The Unit, to name a couple at random.
(The last paragraph contains a minor spoiler)
I want to address some of the complaints from other reviewers. 
First of all, the dialog. It _is_ brisk, it is salted with acronyms and military slang, and all in all has a ring of authenticity that once again outscores other military dramas that come to mind. If you can't hear it, I suggest you improve your TV sound, or it may be time to invest in a hearing aid. If you don't understand it, google-fu is there to help you out. 
Politics. You salty dogs who complain about ""PC"" in this series need to pay more attention. For one thing, PC culture has definitely infiltrated the military, but this show is definitely sending all kinds of signals that are contrary to that. The latest episode, Getaway Day, even made reference to the current administration's changes to the rules of engagement in Afghanistan, and in a subtly favorable way as well. The thing is, the politics in this show are done deftly and in an understated way that in my opinion is more effective than would be the case with too much boo-rah, and it definitely does not have the level of false equivalency and apology for the enemy that you see in, for instance, The Brave. They are much more respectful of the military (well, except for the ""cake-eaters""!) than anything else I have seen in a long time, and that certainly includes The Unit with all of its manipulative ""conspiracies in high places"" and ""you can't trust anyone"" nonsense. 
Realism. Yes, this show gets some details wrong: weapons, uniforms, equipment, ranks and ratings, etc. All of this stuff is way less important than the story, the characters, the dialog, and the acting. And this series does very well in all of those areas, and continues to improve. It is really hard to get info on all of the details stuff that every military-knowledgeable person will agree on - at least partly because so many of us are arrogant SOBs who won't admit when we get it wrong ourselves. Listen, uniforms and equipment do change over time, top-tier SOP guys can often carry what weps they want, and everything is subject to the chaotic circumstances of conflict. At least this show is trying to tell stories about a real military unit, not some fantasies about a bunch of near-freelancers living in a bunker somewhere. In addition we should consider that too much realism in details might not be best for the security of the real operators.",/review/rw7364653/?ref_=tt_urv

27 June 2021,Br4ve-trave1or,10," One of the best series
","7.5 is absolutely outrageous! I watched the first couple of episodes mainly because I dig David Boreanaz but to be honest I doubted I'd like it being CBS is a mainly procedural channel and I prefer serialized series or shows; with the exception of Persons of Interests (later in the series) that I can think of. THIS SHOW FEELS LIKE AN HBO ORIGINAL I swear. Or at the very least FX. Its incredible. The creator is Benjamin Cavell and if you check his resume I should have known better going into it. Acting phenomenal! Cast perfect! Story arcs each season cant get better. A what I really adore about this series is that it's not a series glamorizing soldiers and out heroes, but rather showing how endless these men and women's sacrifices in life are. It's very heavy but light at times delivering excellent laughs at the perfect moments. You'll fall in love with these characters and feel invested in their lives and have an even bigger respect for our troops. This show portrayed all that and much more. This series is a must see at all costs. What an amazing experience watching all four seasons. It literally changes how you look at life and feel grateful for family and friends. If you really enjoyed a series like Friday Night Lights you will absolutely adore Bravo One and this series.",/review/rw7364653/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2018,kristal-42201,9," Love the cast, great show.
","I like it. It just works, and for me it did from the word go. 
No idea if it is all realistic, but I'm not concerned with that either. Í'm not a Seal so if things aren't all realistic it doesn't bother me. I want to watch a good show that's captivating, and as far as I'm concerned it delivers.
I like the story lines and the cast. The actors seem to have the right chemistry, it just works.
And it is quite refreshing -and surprising- to see David in this lead role, after I'd given up on Bones years ago. I like to see him playing a masculine character as opposed to a masculine woman's doormat. And he pulls it off really well. The man sure as heck has risen on my hunk-O'meter!
Character Clay Spenser manages to throw a little spanner in the works here and there, which gives it all a little extra. 
And don't know why, but I am really fond of actress Jessica Paré's character. Apart from these three, I like all the actors and characters. Doesn't happen very often, usually there's one I dislike. So I feel the casting's done really well.
I'm definitely a fan of the show, and I really hope it doesn't get canceled like so many good shows. 
I love it :)",/review/rw7364653/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2019,toby-315-706951,7," Better than expected
",I have no military background so as a civvy I found this series to actually concentrate on the problems the individuals involved to be a bit of a revelation. No glorifying of war but just a straightforward synopsis of what I can only imagine an elite fighting unit would undergo. They're human. Not robots.,/review/rw7364653/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2017,mshavzin,10," Finally, a show that accepts reality, and still makes you feel good
","Itsd gritty, and it has a tight plot. I watched it with several people who work in the military and they were all impressed by how accurate and how realistic the show was. The cast is amazing, and the plot is very grown up. It is such a departure from the typical cheesy action shows you see today. No stupid gadgets, no morality lessons about how we should dislike our own country. None of that. Oh, and the guys are HAWT! David Boreanz is gorgeous as ever. I would almost love to read the triggered reviews here, but it would be too boring. Oh, and one more awesome thing; There is a character named Stella, the stereotypical hypocritical feminist Millennial, and I love that they dropped her in. Kind of a wink wink at those in the know.

24 January 2022,sunraider,10," Can't believe this was a network TV show!
","I discovered this show on Paramount+ as I cut the cord years ago as network TV just didn't offer me anything that I actually wanted to watch. I still can't believe this show is/was a network TV show. I have binged watch up to Season 5 and I sure hope this is renewed. Unlike some past fare such as ""The Unit"" and the short-lived ""Over There"" the focus of this show remains squarely on the team and we're not bogged down with ""homefront"" concerns unless the team members are experiencing them. I'm impressed with the story lines and exploration of real world issues such as PTSD, rivalries within special forces community, officer/enlisted divide, changes to the political landscape and even how to handle (or not handle) aging out and moving on. The operators here are portrayed as real people with strengths and weaknesses, and I appreciate that some missions are failures, and that the characters themselves, even if all are operators, can disagree about tactics. The cast is superb, the action looks realistic to my untrained eye, and the writing is top notch. Love how the episodes don't necessarily end with the bow tied neatly but leave you with questions and looking forward to the next episode.",/review/rw7364653/?ref_=tt_urv
