18 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,10," Can't get enough of this show!
","Yellowstone is one of the best shows on tv right now! It's been the #1 show on cable 5 years in a row! It's hard to explain just how good this show really is. The acting, writing, directing, cinematography, production, etc, are all incredible! It's exactly what you expect from a Taylor Sheridan show! Everything he does is fantastic! The acting is some of the best on tv right now. Kevin Costner, Luke Grimes, Cole Hauser, Kelly Reilly, Kelsey Asbille, Jamie Dutton and pretty much the rest of the entire cast all deserve recognition for the incredible job they do season after season! It's one of the rare shows where almost every episode is just as good as the others. I can not recommend this show enough, just go watch it for yourself!",/review/rw5953862/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,10," Love This Show!
",Yellowstone has easily become one of my favorite shows on tv. It's now going on to season five and every season has been fantastic so far. Almost every episode of every season is excellent and moves the story forward. There are some slow parts and slow episodes but that's not a bad thing. There is plenty of action and drama to keep everyone satisfied. The cast is just about perfect as they all give incredible performances. The cinematography is as good as it gets on tv and shows just how beautiful Montana is. I am completely hooked on this show and one of the few shows I still watch live because I love it that much.,/review/rw5953862/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,johnschubert-93854,8," Excellent beginning but tails off
","After two exceptional Seasons the quality has somewhat diminished in future seasons, especially in Season 4 and in the first part of season 5. Season 4 often became an opportunity to advertise horse training which may appeal to some but I was completely bored by it. Sheridan apparently has a spin off series, 6666, planned that will expand on this which I will simply avoid. Season 5 has John Dutton becoming the Montana Governor who's only purpose is to protect his ranch from those who would like to requisition a portion of his land in order to develop ""vacation"" properties for the wealthy and build an airport. Yawn. That story line gets even more boring than the horse training (the only positive was the introduction of his advisor as Governor who besides being a lesbian had some surprising qualities). Almost equally uninteresting is Beth Dutton's never ending effort to punish Summer Higgins (Piper Perabo), an activist against the killing of animals and a vegan as well as being her father's ""advisor"" and apparent ""love"" interest. After a beat down that seemed to have resolved that, Beth's continued sniping has become challenging to watch. Beth Dutton was always a hard core B*tch (which she is proud of) but that was the part of her character that made viewers like her but her vindictive attitude is turning many away from her. It may be time for Taylor Sheridan to focus on other projects or return Yellowstone to what brought so many people to the series in the first place and abandoned the most recent storylines.",/review/rw5953862/?ref_=tt_urv

15 March 2020,Jeddia,9," A solid drama with influences that are all over the palce...

27 November 2021,A_Different_Drummer,10," something no one mentions
","Not only is this one of the best produced, best acted, best written shows in history -- Catherine Fitts even quotes it in her interviews -- but it is also one of the only shows in our new streaming universe that has maintained the quality through four seasons. Your humble reviewer, with over 1700 reviews here, watches a lot of TV. Maybe too much. And, as exciting as the Netflix phenomenon may be, I have tracked literally dozens of shows that ran out of quality writing by the second season. They literally did not have an actual plan to follow in the event of renewal. Many of these shows are still in production, which is even more astonishing. And distressing. Yellowstone, against that backdrop. Is a true wonder. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

9 July 2018,atlasmb,9," Costner Is Strong As An Aging Cowboy Patriarch
","Kevin Costner is the patriarch presiding over a dynastic ranch that is the size of some countries. His way of life is being impinged on by resort developers, tribal rights, and the authority of the state of Montana. Reminiscent of Rock Hudson in ""Giant"", he is trying to hold on to the old ways.",/review/rw5953862/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2020,jtomlinson-48204,10," This is definitely like watching a moving artistic masterpiece!!
","It is so gorgeous and beautiful to look at and I guess being from Texas, I find it comforting.
Obviously Kevin has gotten better with age! Hot Daddy!
They scored big time to get Kelly Reilly in this! I still tear up when I think of her character in """"Flight""! She is one powerful actress who really puts her heart out there!
I am in love with this show! I don't want to spoil anything so I'll just leave it at this. It is enjoyable to let play in the background or focus on intently. It doesn't try to own you, it just offers you everything to take in as you please.",/review/rw5953862/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2022,TxMike,," Dutton family and their sprawling Montana ranch.
","This series has been on since 2018 but now is the first time I have watched any of it. Last night I completed the first episode of the first season, it runs right near 90 minutes. As to introduce the Dutton family we see they have powerful influence in their valley but are fending off ""attacks."" One from developers who want to put up condos. Another from the neighboring Native reservation looking to get some of their land back plus some livestock. To help deal with all that and the sprawling size of his ranch Dutton (played authentically by 60-something Kevin Costner) has several grown Cowboy sons and a helicopter with a dedicated pilot.",/review/rw5953862/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2018,codamax1,10," Cole Hauser as Rip is AMAZING
","I have seen most of Coles tv work but I have to say when I watched the first
Episode of ""Yellowstone"" and the next few I was so entriged with Rips character and he seemed familiar I had to look up who this handsome dark haired cowboy was and imagined my shock when it said Cole Hauser !!! I was telling myself NO WAY !! Brilliant I tell you JUST brilliant !!!",/review/rw5953862/?ref_=tt_urv

21 June 2018,coronitasc,10," Finally a modern day western worth watching!
",I've been waiting on this show to premiere and I was more than pleased with the performance with the great set of actors and actresses that seem to bring their A game along. Beautiful cinematography and we'll bred horses what else could a gal ask for?,/review/rw5953862/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2023,tomic-nikola,8," Very good show with too many repulsive characters
","My rating for seasons 1-3: 9/10. Now, I'm watching Season 4 and, after 4 episodes, Yellowstone is becoming more and more like a too annoying soap opera. Don't know will I continue.",/review/rw5953862/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2022,Homer_Ate2,5," It was a guilty pleasure until S04
","This show has run dry on ideas and I'm done investing time. None of the characters, save Jimmy, grow or change. It's gone from a modern western to soap opera. To add insult to injury the story now is completely unbelievable, I really think that the duttons are the bad guys in their own show.",/review/rw5953862/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2022,paulwattriley,5," Overhyped nonsense
",Massively overhyped and the epitome of how weird modern people are most of the characters extremely unlikeable however it appears people like horrible nasty people. The good people are disliked. Its basically Dallas with foul mouthed nasty people in a fantasy world of the unbelievable. Yes GOT had this but GOT was pure fantasy this is supposed to be realism but its far from it. Yes I watched all 4 season and it did start of well but soon it was 90% nonsense and watched to see how much more nonsensical it would get.,/review/rw5953862/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2018,characters-132-663775,10," Theater quality programming on Television
","One of the best pieces of television I have seen. Among the ranks with the Sopranos, Mad Men, etc.. Costner fans know he has always been fascinated with the west. Dances with Wolves, Open Range, Silverado. Costner doesn't need to make movies or TV shows anymore. He is a great writer. Given the quality writing and cinematography depicted in Yellowstone, Costner is clearly enjoying making this one. Excellent acting across the cast and the fact that most of the actors are not household names, makes the characters more interesting. I would urge anyone who likes smart dramas to watch this series. If you like westerns, you can's miss it.",/review/rw5953862/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,abidullahk,10," Amazing Show
","I have watched many shows but none of them entraining like Yellowstone since episode one of season one every scene and every dialogue of each character is entertaining, cinematography, acting everything is amazing. Kevin Costner played an amazing role, how he is keeping his promise with his father to protect every inch of his ranch, hats off to the writer, director, Producer and all the team who are creating such a wonderful show to entertain us.",/review/rw5953862/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2023,chris-chasely,10," A Fantastic Show!
","Although this show was available to watch, I just did not feel like watching a western that generally dont appeal to me. But I am pleasantly surprised by how wonderfully this has been made. Kudos to Taylor Sheridan whose direction is simply amazing. The whole production is top class and well worth the watch. Top of the line actors make it very interesting, with special mention to Hauser and Reilly, both of whom are exceptional in their acting chops. Costner is good as the head of the Dutton family. Very interesting storyline along with picturesque backdrops. What a wonderful show, indeed and highly, highly recommended!",/review/rw5953862/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2019,knifemagnet,4," Plodding and worsens as it moves forward
","I ran across a video on YouTube where Costner approaches some tourists on his land; prior to this I didn't know this show existed as I typically avoid 'TV' shows like the plague. While the acting from Costner, Reilly, Hauser, and Huston is solid, the writing and general directing leave a lot to be desired. This thing moves like a soap opera without being of interest. Too much here annoys me, and beyond the writing and general direction of the show, coming in second in the annoyance department is the character Kayce and his annoyingly present son. Throughout season one in its entirety nearly nothing happens that isn't contrived - and that's just how the show feels. One silly episode synopsis read something about John Dutton's secret, which is brought up as a concern, regarding elections, by a governor to a AG candidate (which is not John Dutton) - it's utterly absurd. And that's this show. Absurd. Driving with your son, have a gun in the glove, and see a strange van on the side of the road? Well, of course you go full vigilante with your little irritating son present. And of course this character is a SEAL - cliche? Stick a fork in it. Given the option of watching more of this or staring at my ceiling I choose the ceiling.",/review/rw5953862/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2023,ianlynn-19954,10," Epic!
",I took a while to start watching this. Eventually I thought I would give it a try. To be honest it was a slow burner for the first couple of episodes but then I was drawn in and hooked.,/review/rw5953862/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2021,adamcomito,4," Started strong but the characters are unlikable
","Half way through season 4 and it's really testing my patience. The entire family is unlikable and who knows how any of them lasted this long. Each of the main characters are terrible people and are very hard to have empathy for. As others have said...just sell the damn ranch already, the way they do business is so far from reality it's a wonder the government hasn't raided this place Al la Waco- Branch Davidians style. Way too many bodies hidden on this ranch to be realistic, the feds would have a field day with this family.",/review/rw5953862/?ref_=tt_urv

3 April 2019,YabbaDabbaDabba,2," We Tried, We Really Tried To Like Yellowstone
","We both like Kevin Costner and he did a good job. But the daughter is overplayed and entirely too slutty and foul mouthed. And OMG, enough of the drunkard. She is the primary reason we gave up on the show. It hurts our eyes to watch it. We also believe both brothers were bad choices for the sons. They are third rate actors and the producers or whoever should have done better casting. They can't carry their weight.",/review/rw5953862/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2021,douglasmcbroom,5," Desperately Needs Balance
","Costner is brilliant. The supporting cast is outstanding. The problem is we need a rooting interest and mostly we don't like these characters very much, especially the daughter played by Kelly Reilly. She is despicable on every level. The son played by Wes Bentley is weak. The son played by Luke Grimes is the only character who gives us a chance to root. His wife, as played by Kelly Asbille, embodies all the arrogance of wokism and revisionist historians. Cole Hauser's character is a one-note thug. Danny Huston and Gil Birmingham are the bad guys of the piece but they get a real run for their money by the supposed good guys.
But more than disagreeable characters, this series desperately needs some humor, some joy, some happiness. It is all negative, all the time.",/review/rw5953862/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2020,lisacarlson,2," Painfully slow, Writing is terrible
",None of the characters are worth watching and this sadly applies to Kevin Costner's character as well. It's the lack of writing which makes this show a real miss.. There's barely any acting going on and you can't rely on the beautiful environment and horses to fill in the large gaps. I can't believe this show is in Season 3 and being renewed. Why?,/review/rw5953862/?ref_=tt_urv
