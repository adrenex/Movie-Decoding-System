11 March 2019,AlsExGal,6," Absolute power corrupts absolutely
","This film is nothing really special, and it telegraphs what is going to happen from miles away. The story is about four teen girls in a Catholic high school who are outcasts for different reasons - one lives in poverty with a semi-abusive stepfather, another has a scarred arm and back, another is the victim of boiler plate racism, and the fourth - well, I could never really figure out her problem other than she was the new girl in school.",/review/rw5331239/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2005,RobertF87,6," Interesting and Entertaining Film
","This is a very entertaining blend of supernatural thriller and teen movie. Sarah (played by Robin Tunney) is the new girl at a Catholic shool in Los Angeles where she meets a group of girls (Fairuza Balk, Neve Campbell and Rachel True) who dabble in witchcraft. When Sarah joins the group they discover that they have genuine power and start using it to sort out their personal problems, until the group's leader Nacy (Balk) starts taking it too far.",/review/rw5331239/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2014,LanceBrave,7," Nancy is Burning with Fear and Pain
","A couple of things were popular in the late nineties. The sudden success of ""Scream"" made horror movies not only popular again but hip for the first time in years. Suddenly, the genre that had been masked madmen hacking up teens for a decade had to have sharp scripts and realistic, in-the-know protagonists. Around the same time, a rising awareness of new age pagan religions made ""witch"" a hot buzzword. Witches weren't green-skinned, cackling hags anymore. They could be normal people. These two interests intersected with ""The Craft,"" a poppy teen and femme-oriented horror flick that attempted to bring the witch concept into the present day.",/review/rw5331239/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2006,Lady_Targaryen,7," One of the first witch movies I watched
","In 1996, when this movie was released, it was very popular and I was 10 years old. I remember that ''The Craft'' was one of the very first movies about witchcraft I watched and liked a lot, and at that time I was all excited with Wicca and stuff like that.(But I know that this happened with a big number of people,specially girls) I only discovered this year that the actress who plays Nancy, Fairuza Balk , really is a witch: Maybe that's the reason why I think her looks and role are one of the best. It's funny to see Neve Campbell when she wasn't so famous as she is now. (By the way, it's my impression or she is inactive?) Sarah, played by Robin Tunney, is THE witch, the really powerful and good one, since her late mother was a powerful white witch, and unlike the other girls, she has the inherent gift of witchcraft herself.",/review/rw5331239/?ref_=tt_urv

25 November 1999,MadBadMovieman,8," A Suspenseful and Creepy Movie
",Not a really new story about Witch Craft among girl friends but enough twists and surprizes and effects to rise above most.  Very well done by all Especially Robin and Fairuza.  Very Good effects.  Good vs. Evil conflict really kept you in the movie. Great to see in a theater or on a big screen.,/review/rw5331239/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,8," If you want a good cat fight, watch it
","It's not a scary movie, it's like a weird version of ""Clueless"". It brings me back to when I was in grade school and wanted to be apart of high school. And I always wondered if this was like what my future would hold meeting new people. Witches? ",/review/rw5331239/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2007,disdressed12,8," think mean girls with an edge(and multiply that to the nth degree)
","i liked this movie.i found it entertaining,creepy and amusing,for all the right reasons.the cast was perfect for this movie.the four main actresses seemed so natural together and really worked well off each other.it's fairly obvious this movie inspired others as well as some TV shows,one in particular.i loved the soundtrack.it just seemed so fitting not just for the movie but for the subject material.i think they the subject matter well,without making it ridiculous and campy.plus,the movie has many relevant issues for that age group (teenagers in high school) as well as society in general.it also has a great moral lesson,which i won't give away,but is probably fairly obvious.overall,the movie is a fun and thrilling 90 plus minutes.""The Craft"" is easily an 8/10 from me.",/review/rw5331239/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2006,NoName1989,7," Not bad!
","This movie was better than I expected. It's about a girl who moves and meets three girls at her new school, who seem to be practicing witchcraft... The movie certainly appealed to me, the acting was not bad, certainly Robin Tunney (who plays Veronica in ""Prison Break"") did a good job, but also Neve Campbell and Rachel True are acting alright. The only person of who I didn't like the acting, was Fairuza Balk. Her voice is (in this movie) not exactly the nicest voice to listen to. But she dóés have some good moments in this movie. Director Andrew Fleming, who's budget for The Craft wasn't so big, did a good job. The movie is -at least in the first half- a good combination between a thriller and a comedy, in the end, all the comedy disappears, the atmosphere darkens and we get a fairly exciting thriller. Some of the special effects are very good. The music was o.k., but (except for a few scenes) nothing more. If you have the chance to watch this, try it! The movie will certainly not appeal to everyone, the movie is more for teenagers and people in their early twenties, I think. Many older people won't appreciate this film so much. But everyone should give The Craft a try!",/review/rw5331239/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2002,Darkest_Rose,10," I Love The Craft
","The Craft is one of my favorite movies of all time. I just love it so much, everytime I watch it I go into this fantasy world. It's about a girl named sarah(Robin Tunney) she moves into a new town due to some bad past experiences. In the beginning everything goes great, she becomes best friends with these three girls that are interested in the occult and practice witchcraft. They are known as outsiders in the school, and when sarah becomes friends with them, they form a circle. Sarah feels wonderful, finally she feels like she belongs. The three girls consist of nancy, the gothic wicked leader(fairuza balk), bonnie, the insecure one(neve campbell), and rochelle, the shy one(Rachel True). Suddenly Sarah realizes that their spells and wicked fun have to come to an end. She feels like everything is going out of control and that the gang, especially Nancy is going a little insane and is using her power in evil ways. When Sarah tries to leave the circle, nancy turns her back on her and tries to ruin her life in every way she can. This is seriously a great movie, and if you are looking for a wicked fun time, definately see the craft. All the actresses are great, especially Fairuza Balk, she is so hot and so damn gorgeous. I would give The Craft 10/10",/review/rw5331239/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2020,jp_91,10," Classic horror teen movie!
","""The Craft"" is a classic horror film about teen witches, a lot of witchcraft elements well executed and a wonderful script are the main points of this film. The performances are good, a cool cinematography and great special effects, are important points too. The lead cast: Robin Tunney, Fairuza Balk, Neve Campbell and Rachel True are horror icons!

28 November 2015,davispittman,10," MUCH better than the average teen flick
","The craft is a much better than average teenage Wiccan thriller. It contains very good performances by all the actors, including Neve Campbell. The film has excellent special effects. And the plot summary is well constructed and a lot better than I expected. The main thing about this movie is that it is very entertaining and fun to watch. I love all the things that happen in the movie and especially the ending. The ending is very well constructed but I will not give it away you'll have to go see for yourself. A lot of teenage movies really don't have good acting performances but this is a big exception. I was extremely impressed and pleased with the casting and the execution by the Actors. All of the characters are so deep and well written too. the execution of the plot is so great in this film. And the movie also teaches a great lesson and drives a positive message for teenage audiences. Don't abuse your gifts, use them for good. 10/10 for The Craft. A really fun ride.",/review/rw5331239/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 1999,thefan-2,8," A good fantasy movie that capitalizes on the neopaganism boom.
","One of the complaints brought against this movie by practicing wiccans is that it gives the false impression that wiccans engage in ""bad"" magic -- putting curses and spells on one's enemies. I would like to remind any peeved wiccans who might read this that the biggest lie this movie tells about them isn't that they cast spells, but that their spells actually work.",/review/rw5331239/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2002,alicekeymer,," Very Cool
","The great thing about The Craft is that it reminds me of those 80's horror movies I used to watch as a kid. It's got suspense and thrills, which so few horror films have had in recent years. I would recommend it to anyone. I can't find a thing wrong with this movie, rent it now, trust me you won't regret it",/review/rw5331239/?ref_=tt_urv

14 June 2021,Johnny_West,10," Great Cast
","Fairuza Balk versus Robin Tunney is a great conflict between two opposing personalities. Tunney has a detached and somewhat cold personality, while Fairuza Balk is off the charts bipolar, flashes of rage and insanity. They are a great contrast and play off each other very well.",/review/rw5331239/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2022,pughspencer,8," Deep themes that age like fine wine
","Despite the movie being as mid-90s as it is, the craft still surprisingly holds up really well today. Of course the main reason being just how well written and relatable our 4 lead characters are. They all come from backgrounds and struggles we all can relate to one way or another. Rather it being broken families, body self-consciousness, or even being bullied for racism. They have incredible chemistry together & can't deny you want to be part of this group. The Witchcraft element is played out very believable & we cheer to see our leads get their happiness. But as we all know sometimes great power can fall in the wrong hands. Cannot think of a better cast from that time period to play these roles. Robin Tunney, a pre-scream Neve Campbell, Rachel True, and of course Fairuza Balk's now iconic performance as the raunchy, sinister, & gorgeous Nancy Downs.",/review/rw5331239/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2013,A_Different_Drummer,10," Massively Under-rated, watch two actors at their peak...
","The strangest phenomena in film today (and I have seen a couple) are films which, when you see them, you think they are merely ""OK"" but on second viewing they get better, third viewing even better, and so on. (FORBIDDEN KINGDOM comes to mind, seen it about 8 times, but there are dozens like this). This has something to do with human nature, I suspect, an innate desire to criticize even where criticism is not called for. I believe this film falls into this category. Every now and then I watch it again, and each time I find less to dislike, and each time I fall a little deeper under the director's spell. But that is the key to this film, aside from camera angles and lighting, the story just builds and builds, the suspense just builds and builds, and not only is the ending pitch-perfect, but even the second ending or anti-climax is fun as well. I have seen a lot of these kinds of films but very few that I can make these claims about. I saw the film again just prior to writing this review and even though I knew what was coming I disappeared into the story. Another odd factoid is that, for whatever reason, this film may have captured Neve Campbell and Robin Tunney at the peak of their craft (sorry for the pun). Tunney's charismatic sweetness works best when it plays off against something darker and Campbell has never been scarier in her career. She never gets to the point of eating the furniture -- which would be overdoing it -- yet you the viewer cannot help but believe her when, depending on the point in the film you are at, she alternatively threatens to kill you, and then asks forgiveness for that same threat. I believe time will be kinder to this film than the current IMDb rating.",/review/rw5331239/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2017,Tweekums,7," Teenage witches in Southern California
","When seventeen year old Sarah Bailey moves to a new school in Los Angeles she initially has no friends but quickly gets close to three other girls; Nancy, Bonnie and Rochelle. These three are very much outsiders at school and see themselves as witches; one of them sees Sarah as the potential fourth member who will make their magic work. They each cast a spell; Sarah wants the boy who hurt her feelings to love her; Rochelle wants revenge on the girl who racially abused her, Bonnie wants her scars to disappear and Nancy, the de facto leader of the group, wants the power of 'Manon' the deity they worship. Their spells soon take effect and not long after that it becomes apparent that they haven't quite gone according to plan; the boy Sarah wanted to love her becomes dangerously obsessive and the other girls enjoy their power a little too much. Sarah believes they must stop their activities but the others, particularly Nancy, are determined to carry on and turn against Sarah.",/review/rw5331239/?ref_=tt_urv
