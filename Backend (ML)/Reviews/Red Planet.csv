23 March 2019,Bertaut,6," Aesthetically flawless and brilliantly acted, but too melodramatic and generic for me
",Rarely has a filmmaker been so intimately tied to a place as two-time Academy Award-winning writer/director ,/review/rw4682833/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2019,PipAndSqueak,7," And only one speaks out...
","In order to get to a point where the story really begins to play out, there is a very long and unfocused backstory introduction. We don't really know what we are supposed to be taking note of. We feel like a fly on the wall, or indeed the drone filming the family wedding...too distant to be engaged in the real actions. We are given a few mis-directions and red herrings, not that we could ever work this out to begin with. We start to believe that a teenage girl has set up a huge scam. This is preposterous but we do so anyway. One character does suspect the truth and is alone in speaking out. Everyone else tip toes about keeping the secrets everyone else also knows. The victims are ultimately the ones who try to make amends. It's a sad tale where no one wins. A subtle and well made film of toxic family closeness.",/review/rw4682833/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2018,DimitrisPassas-TapTheLine,6," A decent Spanish crime/thriller with a great cast.
","''Everybody Knows'' (''Todos Lo Saben'') is a Spanish crime/thriller, written and directed by Asghar Farhadi (''The Salesman'', ''About Elly''), starring Javier Bardem, Peneleope Cruz and Ricardo Darin. The story is simple enough, a teenage girl disappears in a family wedding night and leaves her parents in absolute despair. The plot is rich and as the film evolves vast number of secrets and lies within the family circle are revealed, a fact that enhances the mystery and the whodunit element of the story. Nobody and nothing is what it seems in a movie that reminded me -in terms of plot and atmosphere- another Spanish television series, titled ''Bajo Sospecha''. As you imagine, there are plenty of twists and turns and if ''Everybody Knows'' was twenty to thirty minutes shorter in length, it would be an ideal Euro-thriller, worthy of a four-star rating. The performances are solid and the three experienced protagonists are more than convincing in their respective roles. The main flaw in this film is its ending. I found it to be weak and anticlimactic, ruining the overall movie sensation. As a result my rating is a whole star lower than I originally planned.",/review/rw4682833/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2018,borislav_dimitrov,8," Sad story but probably sufficiently authentic
",I went to the premier of the movie with a great anticipation and I can say it fits well into what could be expected from Mr Farhadi. ,/review/rw4682833/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2019,tigerfish50,7," Somebody Knows
","The films of Asghar Farhadi are renowned for being suspenseful dramas, but 'Everybody Knows' switches genres and plunges into thriller territory. The story begins as 40-something Laura returns to her native Spain for a younger sister's wedding, accompanied by her teenage daughter Irene. During the festivities, Irene is drugged and abducted, with the kidnappers leaving evidence they were behind a previous abduction where the victim had been killed.",/review/rw4682833/?ref_=tt_urv

28 May 2019,lavatch,8," A Pandora's Box of Family Secrets
","""Everybody Knows"" starts with a lavish Spanish wedding with family members traveling from afar and reuniting for the festive occasion. For the first twenty minutes of the movie, one might expect a ""Mamma Mia"" film with everyone friendly, bubbly, and affectionate. And then...the family baggage boils and rises to the surface.",/review/rw4682833/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2019,bankofmarquis,8," Great acting from Bardem and (especially) Cruz
","I have always liked, but not loved, the English language movies that Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem have been a part of. Part of the issue, I think, is that even though they are dynamic, charismatica and GOOD LOOKING screen presences that embody the very definitioni of the term ""MOVIE STAR"", they are working in a language that is not their native language, so something, I think, gets lost in translation. So, it was with some excitement that I checked out the Spanish language thriller EVERYBODY KNOWS (Spanish Title: TODOS LO SOBEN).",/review/rw4682833/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2019,carlos-pires,9," Great movie with amazing performance by a stellar cast
","This is a great movie in all respects. Everything is just about right. The plot is intelligent, the script doesn't require you to skip through hoops, all the characters are believable and show their depth as the movie progresses, and ho boy, what a cast! Even the extras are good and the supporting cast is amazing, but Penélope Cruz and Xavier Bardem show in this movie that they are two of the greatest living actors.
And if you want to see how to do handheld camera work, this is it.
If I had to pick a single movie from 2018, this would be it.",/review/rw4682833/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2019,harry_tk_yung,," Soap opera in the hands of a good director
","Soap opera material in the hands of a good director can be concocted into an engrossing film. Iranian director Asghar Farhadi is just such a director. Don't expect ""Everybody knows"" to be at the same level as his Oscar Winning ""A separation"", but it is without a doubt a few notches above your average thriller-melodrama.",/review/rw4682833/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2018,gonijohn,9," Excellent script
","I disagree with the majority of viewers, I think it was an excellent story with a
remarkable character, Paco, the son of the maid, who gives everything when
he loves, and rejects Laura's excuses for her reasons of abandoning him (there
is no excuse if you love somebody). In addition the realistic relations in this
fallen landlords family, and the relations of the family with the ex-workers, is another point for the movie. Asghar Farhadi was good for another time, even outside Iran (don't forget ''Le passe'', midway between West and Iran). This is not as good as ''A separation'' but certainly one of the best movies in 2018.",/review/rw4682833/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2018,KarenYVR,8," Family is the play, Trust is the director and Life is the stage. Action.
","Everybody Knows evokes some contemporary moral dilemmas that play out in melodramatic relationships complicated by the questionable bond of trust among husbands, wives, and lovers. This movie is another perfect addition to Persian director Asghar Farhadi's resume as he is approaching international recognition by writing and directing multicultural film that includes actors such as Cruz and Bardem. This power couple make the film a pleasure to witness in terms of acting, as they are giving us pure emotions in their original language which seems effortless to both. A very emotional and thought-provoking journey that ends with all plot questions answered but leaves with the morality of the story to deal with on you.",/review/rw4682833/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2018,filmtravel101,6," Nobody knows but clueless Plot - great acting. Wait for the video or netflixs
",This film had lots of potential and could have been so much more interesting instead of this slow tale that has a massive plot hole the size of Mars.,/review/rw4682833/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2022,li0904426,8," Not Everybody Knows!!!
","Once again, Iranian writer and director Asghar Farhadi gives us a story where past relationships are detonators of current events. Firstly, he introduces us the characters and environments with every possible details, then he opens a myriad of circumstances and plausible cases . Asghar Farhadi was very intelligent and smart by setting this plot in a culture of Latin tradition like the Spanish one. This movie would not work if the characters were American, Scandinavian or Middle East. The family tradition, the close relationship of each family member, religion and the drama fully fit into Latin culture. Javier Barden shines again as Paco with a performance on the right tune, without exaggeration, great charisma and simple. Don't expect a Hollywood movie from Asghar Farhadi where the ending is detailed and matches your expectations. His movies were made for us to reflect on what is next after the credit starts rolling up.",/review/rw4682833/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2019,ivans536,9," Farhadi's tour de force
","Opening with a beautiful montage of a family driving in the spanish countryside during summer, followed by an atmospheric spanish wedding, this movie charms from the very start. Farhadi puts you in the center of the story, making you feel like one of the rather large family and does a great portrait of Everyday spanish life.",/review/rw4682833/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2018,deloudelouvain,6," Not a mystery masterpiece but not bad either.
","Todos Lo Saben was the second movie I watched from writer/director Asghar Farhadi. Before Todos Lo Saben I watched The Salesman (Forushande) from 2016 and I have a bit the same feeling again. The movie isn't bad but it's not a masterpiece either. You have that constant who-did-it feeling and that keeps you interested in the movie, as well as the excellent cast and acting, but to me it's just a bit too slow. Penélope Cruz and Javier Bardem are both excellent actors so nothing wrong to say about them. They make this movie worth watching, but I'm afraid that I will forget everything about this movie in a week. I watch two or three movie per day so it has to be excellent for me to remember and in this case it just isn't. But there are worse movies, much worse, that's a fact.",/review/rw4682833/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2019,ahicks-2,10," An Astonishing Dramatization of the Social Consequences of a Kidnapping
","The movie, mistaking by many reviewers as an mundanely resolved kidnapping mystery, is instead a drama of the complex cascading results of an ill-time tryst as triggered seventeen years latter by a kidnapling. The drama is simultaneous psychologically true, morally grave, intimately concrete and highly complex yet ever lucid, all at a level equal to that of Farhadi's great Oscar winning THE SEPARATION. Some viewers seem to find the film flawed by its hasty eleventh hour solution to the puzzle of who commit the kidnapping; but the kidnapping is merely the precipitate of, and a scaffolding for, the intense dramatic cascade that constitutes the movies, not the sort of puzzle-to-be-solved that would center the movie were it more than very marginally ""who done it."" Astonishing writing, acting and direction throughout. Astonishing transfer of Farhadi's deeply social and moral conception of the human condition from its native Iranian terrain to Spain.",/review/rw4682833/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2019,phantasma-79041,3," Too long and sometimes too slow
","The movie starts 30' after you 'll push play. The first 30' are useless crap not related to the core play. And then...it's slow. The end is like the movie just stops in the middle of the story / plot. They should have cut 30' in the beginning, make it quicker and add some useful minutes in the end.",/review/rw4682833/?ref_=tt_urv

6 December 2018,CinemaClown,," A Rare Misfire From Asghar Farhadi
","Bringing Asghar Farhadi's winning streak of top-tier filmmaking to a sudden halt, Everybody Knows is a massive letdown from the Persian filmmaker despite its premise & setting being ripe for the tense & gripping family dramas he loves to concoct around an unexpected tragedy. Far from the quality of storytelling we have come to expect from the esteemed auteur, Farhadi's latest is unfortunately one of his weakest.",/review/rw4682833/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2019,domtaylor,7," Realistic with great performances.
","The most striking thing about 'Everybody Knows' is just how real it all feels, thanks to the realistic, convincing dialogue and the outstanding performances across the board. This fantastic sense of realism allows you to be invested in the lives of the characters in the first act, and really amps up the tension in the second. It does take a while to really get going and overall it feels quite long, however it never comes close to ever being 'boring' as you always feel involved with the mysteries. Also, it wraps up quite quickly and the resolution isn't as satisfying as it could have been, but this isn't too much of an issue as it doesn't tarnish what has come before. Overall, it's highly recommendable to fans of both thrillers and family dramas, as it is satisfying on both fronts. 7/10",/review/rw4682833/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's long, but certainly not boring. Recently before seeing this I saw Prisoners and I was expecting the same kind of movie, but it wasn't. While Prisoners is very intense and really focused on solving the case, Everybody Knows is not that intense and exciting. But it is a really good movie, because you see the effect it has on everyone.

","A cast of the best of each house seems to eclipse the film but behind it happens so much ...
A plot for nothing grandiloquent, a classic thriller, that delves into the REALITY of what its characters tell.
I emphasize reality because it seems very complicated that I have managed to make a script like that of a foreign director, Asghar Farhadi.
Farhadi prints in each scene a very special soul with his address so I am left wanting to see more of his filmography.",/review/rw4682833/?ref_=tt_urv
