17 January 2020,Sylviastel,9," You don't pay me enough to commit murder.
","Bob is a sweet hearted divorced businessman who gets heart surgery in a hospital and falls in love with Abishola, his Nigerian nurse. It's a sweet love story played over time. They couldn't be more different. He runs a business about selling thermal dynamic socks. His mother is played by scene stealer, Christine Ebersole, as Dot. The actress who played Abishola does a fabulous and wonderful job in playing a dedicated nurse in a Detroit hospital. Vernee Watson is wonderful as one of her co-workers. Bob is played by Bill Gardell (Mike and Molly). If you want an enjoyable traditional sitcom with an audience, this show is for you. It's about family and relationships. You learn more about the Nigerian culture and language.",/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2019,Ed-Shullivan,10," This sitcom literally knocked my socks off!!!!
","Bob and Abishola's amazing on screen chemistry was pure comedic magic from their very opening scene together. This romantic sitcom may be 22 minutes per episode but it seemed like only a moment in time before it was abruptly over as the quick wit between veteran stand up comedian Billy Gardell, and actress Folake Olowofoyeku, made the half hour fly by far too quickly.",/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2019,trudjoh,10," I absolutely love this show
",I notice other folks are not as enthusiastic as I am about this show. Perhaps because I do not usually watch TV comedy. When I start I cannot get past the first 5 minutes of puerile violent sexist nonsense. This show offers some great characters with great humor. It makes me laugh out loud! Keep it going,/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2019,fastpuppy,8," About as solid a pilot as you get on network tv these days
",Bob Hearts Abishola shows promise and may just be worth watching so long as the characters remain somewhat authentic and it doesn't collapse into the usual tired cliches.,/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2019,gargantuaboy,1," Canned laughter after EVERY line of dialogue.
","I am sorry, I just cannot watch a sitcom where there is literally thunderous fake laughing blasted after EVERY line of dialogue. I just can't , obviously nobody is really laughing that hard at a sitcom this average, the idea that the network has to put on the laugh track like this to make US laugh is so absurd. The terrible laughing is just distracting and quite frankly makes it all LESS FUNNY than it normally would be, if that is even possible.",/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2019,frankuche645,10," As a Nigerian, it makes so much sense. Give it a try .
","I came from Nigeria to Europe and this is so much representing of how hard Nigerians work to make a life life for them selfs and their families. It show the core of a Nigeria mother in great way but sometime seems very stereotypical but i am not mad at it. It is very funny and very representative, i hope y'all give a at least three episodes before you decide to quite.",/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2019,kimmishy5,9," Love this show
",Finally a different kind of Comedy show! The actors are wonderful and the show is laugh out loud funny. Not the usual culture class comedy.,/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2019,brussek-43643,8," I like it
","I hate sitcoms. The laugh tracks, the predictable plots and the endings with a neat little bow but this one seemed a little different. It genuinely made me laugh and I actually cared for the main character, Abishola. I really liked the pilot episode and excited for more.",/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2019,lnbalich-42968,9," Love it! Unusual & Unpredictable
","I can't understand why all the bad reviews. This show is actually funny for a change. It's unlike the other predictable sitcoms that have pea brain, dysfunctional characters and the humor is from their stupidity. Also, the cast of characters in this show are all great and some are veterans from very successful shows (NCIS, Big Bang, etc). They have great comedic timing, especially the main characters.",/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2019,Johnny_West,1," No Chemistry
","Bob has no chemistry of any kind with his Nigerian nurse, Abishola. She always looks at him like she is about to throw up. There is zero chemistry between them.",/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2019,beachy-38431,5," needs help
","They need to cancel the laugh track and give the actors some acting lessons. Some better writing would help too. Billy cannot carry this show alone. I am a fan of his and that is why I watched this show, but even that cannot keep me watching.",/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2019,M0vieL0ver,1," You have to look elsewhere to find humor now
",Who ARE the writers of these very childish and poorly written shows? Where is the humor? This show will not last but I bet they are giving themselves an award already.,/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2020,zenmateisshite,5," Annoying
","I really don't know why I still watch this show.
Characters I like: Bob and his mother. Abishola's household especially uncle and aunt. The two nurses. The younger Nigerian worker.",/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2019,sandbee,8," Easy to Watch and Funny
","I like this new series. I've been a fan of Billy Gardell for awhile now. M & M just cemented his line timing and sense of humor for me. It's got some good lines, some good jokes and very good timing on delivery of those jokes. I'm undecided on the aunt and uncle yet but I like Abishola and her son both. I even like her co-workers that she talks to about some of the Bob/husband/life things. Vernee Watson-Johnson is one of her co-workers and I've liked her since I saw her in Welcome Back Kotter. There are some strong actors in this show with good scripting and funny, endearing lines. The characters have a real quality about them and the actors are good enough to get you involved in the show.",/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2020,rockphiler,3," Horrible, annoying and definitely not funny
","This is perhaps the worst sitcom Chuck Lorre has ever helmed. Stereotypes galore, stupid premise, bad writing and Christine Ebersole's nagging voice should have CBS canceling this but they have nothing in their stores to replace it with. Frankly, there are no endearing characters. Not even Billy Gardell's ""Bob"" is that likeable, and you know when Nicole Sullivan joins the cast they are hoping upon hope.",/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2021,stevebondi,9," Wow! What a funny heartwarming show! :-)
","So many great characters with awesome writing! I am always pleasantly surprised when these premises - that I would normally think I would not find funny - come out of left field and blow me away! My wife and I laugh hard at every episode, and always leave with a smile on our faces! :-)",/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2022,rajikn-73222,5," Just ok in parts, why is Abishola so serious ??
","I wanted to like this show but the lead female character is just so off-putting....doesn't smile, so demanding, strict with her son...why on earth would someone decide to spend the rest of their lives with such an annoying person is beyond me...we can understand she's had her share of struggle and just want to make it successful but it's better such people are left alone lol...u can skip this one or play it along while eating or doing some other stuff just to skip time...",/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2022,nancylmarine,5," I'm torn regarding this show.
","While I like the cast, overall, and really like Billy Gardell in this, I'm on the fence about it because of how Abishola treats her son.",/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2019,evilpinklolita,10," Proof that viewers are hard to please. . .
",I don't understand what people hate so much about the show. I've watched every episode and laughed throughout the whole thing. The actors are genuine and talented. Comparing it to Carol's Second Act does it a great disservice. I stopped watching that horrid show but this one has me eagerly awaiting each new episode. My favorite actors are Abishola's friends but her aunt and uncle are a hoot as well. I have tears coming down from laughing at their dialogue!,/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2019,carlottaeland,9," Here's hoping
",Loved the show! The leads show heart and sweetness. It does remind me a lot of the pilot for Mike and Molly. Here's hoping it doesn't do the same thing and make it a one character show. Mike and Molly was ruined by Molly taking over every scene.,/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,NullUnit,3," Not funny and uninteresting.
","If it weren't for Christine Ebersole, there would be ZERO humor in this show.",/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2019,toncincin,2," Ummmmm ...
",T gas potential - but the pilot was not good. CBS is so desperate to find a replacement for Big Bang - they are putting on total BS shows. This one and the Patricia Heaton show are pretty unwatchable. Lose the laugh tracks please!!!,/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2021,lynneflagg,1," You have lost your focus !!!
","I started watching this show because of the sweet chemistry and romance between the leads, how they found love in spite of their vast differences, made all the more challenging with interfering family and friends. Two ordinary people in love, But, now that they're newly married they barely spend any time together! It's all about Kimi and Chic what's his name and tired unfunny jokes about sex between them. The appeal and charm of the show is fading fast. Can you please focus on the main characters?? This show was my one weekly ritual but it this trend continues, what a disappointment.",/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2020,cherold,8," sweet, funny sitcom has an old-school structure but a refreshing multi-culti attitude
","This is the sort of conventional, old-fashioned sitcom I generally avoid. But the series has several things going for it. First off, it's genuinely funny. Second, it is a remarkably successful attempt to take on the cultural disparity of the American melting pot. Cultures meld and collide, issues are raised like it's a Norman Lear sitcom, and all the while you've got this lovely, genial romance between two pleasant, genuinely sweet people.",/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2019,TVIsDead,1," ""Diversity""
","Trying way to hard to pretend to be diverse, not funny and not interesting in the slightest. Seems more actual racist than anything with the way her and her family act.",/review/rw5309524/?ref_=tt_urv
