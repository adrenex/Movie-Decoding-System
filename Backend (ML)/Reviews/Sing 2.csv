25 October 2022,evanston_dad,9," Lampooning the Rich
","The triangle of sadness is that space right above the nose and between the eyebrows that can get all bunched up when someone is worried, or angry, or confused. We're told this in the opening moments of ""Triangle of Sadness"" when a male model is asked to relax his during an audition. That model, Carl, played by Harris Dickinson, is dating Yaya (the late Charlbi Dean), a social media influencer, and the first chapter of this film, titled ""Carl and Yaya,"" consists almost entirely of the two of them bickering. Carl is vaguely frustrated by the dynamic in their relationship and feels manipulated by Yaya, but in ways he can never clearly articulate. He thinks they fall too quickly into stereotyped gender norms, but every time Yaya tries to correct the situation, he gets angry and tells her she's not getting the point. Does Carl have a valid beef with Yaya, or is he just being a jerk? Yaya admits that she's manipulative and confesses to feeling contrite about it, but is she really? And in any case, do I care about the not super important tribulations of these vapid people, and do I want to spend two and a half hours watching them?",/review/rw8566146/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2022,californiahummus,9," Horror movie of a different sort
","This is why I used to go to theaters - to watch thought provoking entertaining movies. While there may be little to no blood - this movie is brutal. No stone is left unturned as you move through society's expectations of class, money and sexual politics. This is not light breezy fun and is sure to turn your stomach just watching it at times. This is a return to an original script not based on some comic book or sequel of some long drawn out franchise. I mean you could watch another DC/Marvel movie but is there a point to that anymore? This is in my humble opinion the best movie of 2022 (so far).",/review/rw8566146/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2022,jtindahouse,9," The total package of a film
",I kept seeing rave reviews coming out of Fantastic Fest 2022 for 'Triangle of Sadness' and it has been on my radar ever since. I saw it was slightly on the longer side in terms of run times so it took me a little while to find the time to watch it. I'm so glad I did though. This is one of the best films I've seen all year.,/review/rw8566146/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2022,stevelivesey67,4," Arthouse lovers will love it. For everyone else, pretentious beyond belief
","Set in 3 parts, it's a movie about despicable, unlikeable people, some rich, some not, in a 'Lord of the Flies' type situation.",/review/rw8566146/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2022,TheVictoriousV,9," Absolutely excellent
","Triangle of Sadness (or Sans Filtre) is most likely the best film Ruben Ã–stlund has ever made. I say ""most likely"" because I'm actually a bit behind on this director, having only seen The Square when I was analyzing its screenplay for my degree project in 2019, ergo I couldn't take in its twisted satire or defiant imagery the way I would've liked.",/review/rw8566146/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2022,kluseba,2," Bloated, Pretentious and Shallow Drivel
","Triangle of Sadness has received much critical acclaim and comes around with a plot that sounds interesting on paper. The truth is however that this movie is vapid, pretentious and exhausting drivel that doesn't deserve the attention it's getting. Let me point out how I have come to this conclusion.",/review/rw8566146/?ref_=tt_urv

28 November 2022,cahidi,5," Triangle of Unbearable Boredome
","Look, I get why people are giving high ratings for this movie. It's a satire and has a strong message and whatnot. But the thing is, it can be done with much less screen time. You don't have to drag it out for more than 2 hours. There's so many useless scenes in this movie. I kept fast forwarding while watching, yet I still get the gist of it. And while it's interesting to see how the social ladder gets turned upside down, it's not interesting seeing dragged for so long. It gets boring and dull. Plus there wasn't any admirable character in this movie that the audience would want to root for. They're all just lowlifes. I don't know about you, but I don't enjoy watching immoral people doing the dirty. So for me, this movie is a big NOPE. For you who enjoy this kind of stuff, good for you. Enjoy it. I'd rather find something with more morality in it. Cause this world is already bleak without more bleak messages like this one. I'd rather not see more of these.",/review/rw8566146/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2022,dzeilstra,4," Mostly boring
","This is one of those movies that you watch, and want to watch because of all the acclaim it received, but in the meantime check the clock all the time to see how many minutes more to go. It is one of those movies where I wonder what I don't see what is so obvious to others. It is like being in a modern art museum and watching this huge painting which is just a white surface with one red and blue line running over it. It eludes me what people see in it and I always suspect the maker to be hiding behind some column laughing at all of us. The emperors clothes.",/review/rw8566146/?ref_=tt_urv

22 December 2022,Tweetienator,3," The Line of Boredom
","Somewhere may be a good movie or story hidden, but I wasn't able to filter it out of all the redundant noise. The humorousness scenes did most of the time not work for me, also there is at least one hour that you could easily cut and it would improve the affair a lot. Till we get on the ship we get bored to death with a lot of mostly useless and unnecessary scenes after scenes. The commentaries on society and capitalism, well, have the depth and subtlety of an election flyer of some left-wing party. And last but not least, some of the scenes and dialogues are really cringe-worthy. Well, if you try to make art, there is always the possibility to fail.",/review/rw8566146/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2022,vedvaghela,3," There's such a thing as too much on the nose
","I dislike this film. It's boring and random and one of the few films where I, personally, thought that the acting was stale. The overall movie is so much about ""delivering the message"" that plot nosedives and ends up becoming bland.",/review/rw8566146/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,Lockout_Salties,5," What people who don't watch art movies think art movies are like
","There has been a lot of buzz about Triangle of Sadness, especially given that it won the prestigious Palm D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Generally, however, reviews have been divided, with some calling it a hilarious anti-rich romp, and some criticizing it for being shallow in its satire.",/review/rw8566146/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2022,Boristhemoggy,1," It was sure sadness for me
","The first thing I want to say is, all of the pretentious explanations of why this film was good, are down to the fact that some people have to see the good in bad, to prove their higher worth and higher appreciation of art.",/review/rw8566146/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,3," Triangle of Sad Filmmaking.
","This mess is a result of being on a bad acid trip when writing the screenplay, then drunker than Woody Harrelson's (the only reason I gave this a watch) character when directing. All the high praise and positive reviews are probably the result of those viewers being under the same influence of bad recreational pharmaceuticals and cheap liquor.",/review/rw8566146/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2022,wisemanfromtowne,3," Trailer has all the best parts.
",After watching the trailer I was so excited about downloading and watching this dark comedy which I proceeded and did. It's starts off great with the scene of the male models being interviewed and then young couples dialog over who pays for the dinner at the restaurant and then the story jumped to the story of the passengers on the yacht with Woody as their captain. But after they are shipwrecked (no spoilers on the how and why) the story takes a serious nose dive and starts falling completely apart in the process. The build up to the ending scene was totally nonsensical and you realize that the trailer has the best parts for entire film. A underwhelmingly recommended one time watch. Heads up.... Woody Harrelson's role is short and brief.,/review/rw8566146/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2022,thesmythley,3," Sub-par, style-over-substance postmodern satirical film without much bite
","Unfortunately I had high expectations for this film, which makes it all the more painful to have to write this review. It was unfortunate to watch a film in which the targets, a group of the elite, could have been attacked in such a more effective and witter fashion. Instead you have some pretty cheap slapstick, gross-out humoured attempts at comedy which is overdone. If you were expecting any witty dialogue then forget it. The audience will get the obvious symbolism littered carelessly throughout the film, but apart from that it comes across as a very formulaic, falling pretty flat in the kinds of mechanisms it employs. The latter third of Triangle of Sadness becomes completely predictable and doesn't really come across as satirical comedy. It seems to bafflingly mark a transition away from satire to more of a castaway sort of situation that appears to be a trashy postmodern recreation of the old film, ""The Admirable Crichton."" The exception is that it lacks any depth and could've been so much better, even when it does try desperately hard to come across as furnishing the audience with deep political or philosophical themes. Was it supposed to be funny, a progressive feminist take or sophisticated subversive turn in watching one of the wealthy characters become manipulated into having sex with one of the workers in a wholly predictable ""exploited turned exploiter"" character role reversal? In short, it is a postmodern farce that lacks any real substance and far too heavily on style - appearing to be more prosaic than it actually is.",/review/rw8566146/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2022,Muhammad_Rafeeq,9," SWEDISH ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 9 /10
","Classism, capitalism, materialism and wealth are all on the chopping block in ""Triangle Of Sadness,"" writer/director Ruben Ã–stlund's spiritual follow-up to his 2017, Golden-Palm-winning satire ""The Square."" Satires are usually either a hit or a miss for me. Whether I understand the message is not really where things all break down for me either. Instead, it's the communication of the message - the execution - that can make or break a satire for me. Am I lectured to? Talked down to? Beaten over the head? With ""Triangle Of Sadness,"" Ã–stlund nails that sweet spot of delivering a nuanced message in a satisfying manner, with inarguable entertainment value and great performance work throughout. This piece covers so much ground - narratively, logistically, as well as thematically. It's really quite impressive work. I think the best thing I can say about a satire is that, when things round out, you really get a clear sense of the filmmaker's take on the subject matter at hand. I think ""Triangle Of Sadness"" earns that acclamation in spades.",/review/rw8566146/?ref_=tt_urv

","The winner of the 2022 Cannes Film Festival's coveted Palme d'Or prize, Ruben Ã–stlund's Oscar nominated latest slice of melancholy and home truths about the human condition is going to be a divisive exercise for audiences as the Swedish director examines the divide between the haves and the have nots in an epic darkly comedic operation that will likely ensure it's sometime between trips to your local seafood market.",/review/rw8566146/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2022,antoniotierno,10," simply a masterpiece of absurdity and provocations
","The film, perfectly directed by the Swedish director Ruben Ã–stlund, works perfectly well when it sticks to the absurdist comedy tone that it sets up in the first half of the story. It is about an absurdist comedy, also known as surreal humour, concerned with building up expectations and then knocking them down by the unexpected turns, in order to show the funniest reaction, and doing this all for the viewer's amusement. We get characters so bloody rich, that they totally are disconnected from reality, with their outlandish requests and demands. Their behaviour is only further enabled by the cruise crew, who always say yes to their crazy and outrageous demands, regardless of how disruptive it may be.",/review/rw8566146/?ref_=tt_urv
