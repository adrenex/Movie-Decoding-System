27 July 2014,planktonrules,9," Amazingly strange...and funny.
","While I am 50 years old and WAY outside the target audience for this show, my 24 year-old daughter is hooked--so much so that she always insists that I watch ""Gravity Falls"" with her. And so this is how I came to see the show--and I assume most who have reviewed the show are much younger than I am!",/review/rw2843191/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2013,newkidontheblock,9," Gravity Falls: a Diamond in the Disney Channel Rough
","There are few things I hate more on television than the Disney Channel. This factory of mediocrity has churned out ""gems"" like The Suite Life with Zach and Cody and the unfortunately popular Hanna Montana. The Disney Channel is a place for Uncle Walt's successors to push talentless teens out in front of the world. Said teens get a few moments of fame and the Mouse gets another few million.",/review/rw2843191/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2019,doomedmac,9," One of my all-time favorite shows
","Really, really, really funny. Great, real, relatable, hilarious, heartwarming characters. Bill is a great villain, and I love almost every character.",/review/rw2843191/?ref_=tt_urv

","Gravity Falls is a new show on Disney Channel, and the only reason I heard about it was because of a friend I have on tumblr. While I haven't been a fan of Disney's recent...ventures, I have to say that Gravity Falls is absolutely fantastic.",/review/rw2843191/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2019,Animany94,10," Expertly written with so much care put to creating interesting stories.
","Gravity Falls is one of those shows which both kids and adults can enjoy on their respective levels, because of how the writers carefully made up a premise including both fun, excitement, charm and emotional depth.",/review/rw2843191/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2019,SnoopyStyle,9," brilliant
","Twelve year old twins Dipper and Mabel Pines have been sent to Gravity Falls, Oregon to spend the summer with their great-uncle Gkunkle Stan. Stan had turned his home into a tourist trap, The Mystery Shack. Wendy and Soos work for Stan. Dipper finds a mysterious book detailing the strange creatures living in Gravity Falls.",/review/rw2843191/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2012,Pictoron,10," Surprisingly Great!
","I hate the Disney Channel and what it's become, however I watched this show, and was very entertained! It's not just the humor, but the mixture of surreal situations that connect with the story. Not to mention, THE CHARACTERS! They're all simply fun and the way they get along and interact with each other is great! The setting is pretty cool too, there's always the potential for something completely new and supernatural to occur. I've seen all the episodes so far (all 7) but for the time being, I will continue to keep up with the episodes, and altogether I'm just happy to see that there is still hope for the cartoons of today and the future cartoons.",/review/rw2843191/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2015,MissSimonetta,9," Intelligent and poignant, a true rarity altogether
","With most family entertainment weighed down by formulas, idiocy, and merchandising appeal, it is so wonderful to have a show like Gravity Falls, a production with comedy and heart. It's accessible for kids while still having enough depth for those over the age of twelve, a true rarity on television, particularly Disney television.",/review/rw2843191/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2022,OnjiMooteDaMarle,8," The True Multiverse of Madness
",WOW! I am 37 and how much I enjoyed this show. A better Stranger Things meets a better Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness. Immensely crazy yet so warm. Definitely worthy of yours & your kids' time.,/review/rw2843191/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2020,ontheis,10," Perfect nostalgic summer fun
","One of my favorite (if not favorite) animated shows ever. Watching for a few minutes of the first episode, I thought it was for young children only, but I was so wrong. This show is perfect for anyone, maybe even more appreciated later in life.
It's funny, every single episode is pure entertainment... The only flaw is that is so short! Maybe better to end it so it never fades and keep the charm, but still it has a great potential to be much much longer. At least I hope for more animated TV shows with the same vibe - Oregon summers, nature and magic!
Can't wait for other things to come out by the creator!",/review/rw2843191/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2020,berg-74532,10," I want MORE!!
","Few kids shows can truly be enjoyed by adults and for obvious reasons. This show is incredible it's not dumbed down. The stories are entertaining the writing is excellent. If you have kids and struggle to find things that are entertaining for you without sex, language and story lines that you don't need to keep your finger on mute or the last channel key this easily fits the bill. I can't believe that this came and went before I was aware of it. It's truly a shame that it's only about 50 episodes and I have absolutely no doubt this will be fondly remembered and will be on lists of best shows forever.",/review/rw2843191/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2021,BabelAlexandria,10," Like Twin Peaks for Kids
","Our first show on the Disney channel, and not what we were expecting. It's got a perfect mix of the funny and mildly creepy (but not terrifying), which makes appropriate viewing even for kids younger than the teen and tween groups. And yes, the parallels to Twin Peaks are too many to count and clearly influence the series' characters and plot. The appeal of the series also has much to do with the positive, supportive, if sometimes strained relationship between the twins Mabel and Dipper, and their connection to the hilarious shyster ""Grunkel"" Stan. Though the parallels are only partial, I'm sure that part of the reason my kiddos enjoyed this so much is because they see themselves in the main characters, and, just maybe, their grandfather in Stan, and their uncle in Soos.",/review/rw2843191/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2013,rachelfranke94,10," An Absolute Must-Watch
","Okay, I'll be the first to admit that when the promos for this show first aired on Disney Channel, I wasn't interested. I hadn't particularly enjoyed Fish Hooks, and I figured Gravity Falls would be more of the same. I was so wrong. This show is full to bursting with fantastic and lovable characters, witty humor, great writing, beautiful animation, and mysteries, fantasy, and little Easter eggs around every corner. In addition, there are a few elements that could easily give me nightmares, but which, oddly enough, the kids I babysit find more hilarious than anything. Guess it's the age difference. If you haven't yet, you definitely need to give this show a shot. I know Gravity Falls fans from age two to fifty, and I'd recommend it to anyone.",/review/rw2843191/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2021,chloebetts,10," Needs more attention
","THIS SHOW IS SLEPT ON. It is literally soooo good. When I thought it couldn't get any better, they hit me with another bang. Gravity Falls is top tier and needs more recognition.",/review/rw2843191/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2012,djdcartoons91,10," So far a Near Perfect Show
","Disney has been making some radical changes in recent years. Back in the day Disney was always known for its films and amusement parks, its original creator driven content always seemed to take a backseat. For years the only decent original Disney channel series were Fillmore! and The Weekenders. However like I said recently Disney has been taking a bold new direction. The addition of Disney XD has led to the creation of some great shows Phineas and Ferb and particularly Chris Prynoski's new show Motor City. Their current original content mirroring the 90's shows that put creator driven series on the map. Their latest play in this new direction the creation of what so far promises to be perhaps their best creator driven series yet Gravity Falls.",/review/rw2843191/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2019,panoskonidis,10," Why are you reading the ratings ?
","It's Gravity Falls. There is no point on seing the ratings of the people. You know there are all great rating because the show is just great. Again, IT'S GRAVITY FALLS !!!",/review/rw2843191/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2017,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,10," Disney's best animated TV series since Gargoyles!
","Gravity Falls is easily the best animated series Disney's made in a long time! It's got mystery, humour, slice-of-life drama and a complex examining of the dynamics of sibling relationships. Alex Hirsch gives us one of Disney's crowning achievements for the decade, and Disney XD's finest show to ever grace the channel. And a cartoon that is arguably part of the 'Golden-Age-of-Television' renaissance.",/review/rw2843191/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2012,lord-pigeon,10," One of the best cartoons in recent years...
","Over the years, many shows have let me down in terms of storyline, humor, and originality. It seemed to me that every major children's network disappointed in all three aspects. I actually anticipated this show months before it even aired because, despite the fact that there wasn't much information available about it online, the premise sounded promising.",/review/rw2843191/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2020,auuwws,9," Gravity Falls
","A great series, the best series produced by the Disney Channel, despite the fact that the first season was not at that level, but the second season was great and the series was greatly upgraded. Most of the series' characters were excellent. The relationships of the characters in the movie were excellent, especially between the twins and their uncle. The story of the series was excellent, the series's villain, they were very excellent The series' comedy was funny in most case es",/review/rw2843191/?ref_=tt_urv

9 March 2013,lovlyc1222,10," Great show for broad range of ages
",Very few shows have the capacity to entertain 8 and 10 year old girls a 13 year old boy and their 27 year old woman. Like the Shrek movies it has humor for youngsters and a stealthy adult humor. Definitely has elements from many cartoon predecessors and often times will ground a plot on a real life issue. My little cousins love it and when they found out I was watching gravity falls at home they flipped out. Now when I go visit we will sometimes watch on episode from the DVR. I literally can't stand most Disney programming but the style and creativity of this show caught my eye one day channel flipping. It is worth checking out and you will most likely be extremely surprised.,/review/rw2843191/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2015,Shopaholic35,8," Surprisingly funny.
","This show is actually really good. It's not just some silly kids show that has vapid lowbrow jokes. Everything is thought out and has a purpose. It actually reminds me of the Disney show The Replacements but better. It has the same smart comedy style that is suitable for adults and children alike. I was initially surprised how clever this show is as the ads and synopsis don't really do it justice, but it is much better than you would expect.",/review/rw2843191/?ref_=tt_urv
