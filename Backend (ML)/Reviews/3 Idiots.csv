27 December 2008,Chrysanthepop,," An Unfinished Journey
","I am among those who have not read the book and I found it to be initially confusing and boring but the film picks up after Lyra is taken into Mrs. Coultier's lavish house. The pace picks up but it may seem a little too rushed. The ending was sort of continuous, requiring a sequel. I would have liked to see the second movie but unfortunately, there is a rumour that it may not happen which is quite a pity because I thought 'The Golden Compass' was going somewhere. It is not the best movie of its kind but I thought it was not so bad either. The special effects are good. The characters are lively. I loved the daemons. It's got quite a stellar cast but only Nicole Kidman gets enough screen time to be noticed. Gorgeous, glamorous and deceitful, could not picture anyone else for the part of Mrs. Coultier. (I am almost sure that the rest were promised a lengthier role in the sequels). Daniel Craig only has about 15 minutes but he makes the best of it. Sam Elliot is funny. Dakota Blue Richards is a confident young actress and she carries off Lyra well. Overall I enjoyed the world that was created in this movie and the characters. Too bad that it's left incomplete.",/review/rw1804653/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2007,JerusalemFace,6," Entertaining, but missed opportunity
","His Dark Materials: Northern Lights, the original name for the book, in the UK. What a poignant, mysterious title for a book. The Golden Compass? Well, it doesn't quite have the same impact, does it? The use of the American name of the book for the film really didn't bother me at first, but as early warning signs come, it doesn't get much more obvious than this; we should have guessed from the off that this was going to be a very different beast to the book.",/review/rw1804653/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2007,simonparker1990,7," If you haven't read the book you'll love it, if you have you'll be a bit disappointed.
","The Golden Compass in my eyes was the must see film of this Christmas. I am a huge fan of the His Dark Materials books, and was reading all three in preparation for the movie to come, I was praying this would be the new fantasy epic to watch. I suppose I got myself way too hyped for this movie, even the slightly negative reviews didn't stop me from being excited, so what a shame to say this cannot help but be a disappointment for me. I have a few major problems with this mainly, mainly I suppose because of the changes from the book, in fact had I have not read the book I most probably would have completely adored the movie rather than have just liked it. The Golden Compass is not a bad movie, its definitely better than the first Narnia movie and Harry Potter movie, but after reading the book I couldn't help but criticise because I know how amazing this movie could have been. Thankfuly the entire cast, yes the entire cast, are absolutely perfect, there are two notable set pieces and the storyline still keeps its grip on the audience despite being rushed. The lack of the ending from the book actually didn't even bother me that much, so long as people who have read the book are aware its going to be in the second movie then I believe that they won't be that bothered. Overall Golden Compass is an entertaining two hours, that could benefit from another half hour. Its a great film to watch for Christmas and will hopefully do well at the box office so the Subtle Knife is made very soon.",/review/rw1804653/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2019,forpassord,9," Even better than I remembered
","I remembered that I liked this movie when I watched it a while ago. But I did not remember that it was THIS good! The only reason for the far too low rating(s) that I can see is christian fanatics that finds ANYTHING resembling criticism towards the church as heresy, or people that have read the book(s) and find that this movie have deviated too far from the original. But for me, the acting, the plot, the visuals, the special effects and the daemons running and flying around, was amazing. If you as I am, are not a christian fundamentalist, or have read the book(s) and like fantasy, I really believe that you as well will enjoy this movie.",/review/rw1804653/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2007,WriterDave,6," Ask the Dust

17 September 2019,Calicodreamin,7," Pretty good movie
","The golden compass is a pretty comparable children's movie. The acting is well done, both from the kids and adults. The cast ensemble is made up of some fairly prominent names. I quite enjoyed watching, though I'm still not sure I get what dust is, or why the college let Nicole Kidman take the girl ""as an assistant"". It was all fairly good, watching ioryek slap the jaw off a polar bear was a highlight. But my main grievance is that they set up for a sequel that never happened, leaving the ending lacking.",/review/rw1804653/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2007,john-quel,9," A Noble Effort, an almost triumph -- May the Box Office Reward It
","I went into this film fearing the worst. I had become concerned over the past months as it became increasingly clear that the film was at great risk of losing direction, the vision if you will, that had drawn readers to the books series in the first place. That it was doomed. I feared this strange kind of anti-Narnia, was likely being so diluted that BO disaster was certain. That may still be the case if the bulk of early reviews are to be believed (but see Ebert's all-out glowing review.) Admittedly, the movie probably works better if you have read the first book (I had), but those readers are precisely the people who would likely complain the most. I worried and yet . . .",/review/rw1804653/?ref_=tt_urv

15 June 2018,elainehowie,9," An enjoyable fantasy and adventure film
","I've never read the book this film was based on, so on it's own I found it pretty enjoyable. It has an intriguing storyline and manages to keep you interested. It did leave much to be desired, as it ended on a cliffhanger, although they were planning on a sequel but plans were scrapped. It is definitely worth an inevitable rewatch.",/review/rw1804653/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2007,mbiajc,2," The blame starts with Chris Weitz and goes north.
","The opening scene was the very first clue that this film was going to be the barrage of formula drudgery that it ultimately turned out to be. Weitz began by unveiling all the information which the reader isn't even aware of by the end of the first novel in a horrific attempt to follow the footsteps of The Lord of the Rings with an opening prelude. Much of the intrigue of Pullman's storytelling is derived from the careful progression of revealed information, letting the reader know only as much as it needs to at any moment, and no more. The mystery is not only lost, it is purposely banished by the blundering slate of exposition which begins with the prologue and carrys on through the film's duration. Every bit of exposition has the feel of a technical bother that must be gotten out of the way so that the action scenes can make some kind of sense. But the real kicker is the obviousness. The obviousness ranging from New Line's less than subtle attempt to repeat a miracle (LOTR), to the individual lines in the film (""Why am I here? What do they want? What is she going to do with me?""), and everything in between. Show, don't tell, is the first rule of third grade story writing, a class these film makers clearly missed.

8 December 2007,thebutcher80,4," Disappointed
","I was so extremely excited for this movie, I had just read the books and truly could not wait to see how it translated to the screen having such a vivid and vibrant plot. My excitement was short lived however when this butchered movie began to roll. The largest flaw was that of character development. The whole beginning of the book truly creates Lyras character and her supporting characters such as Roger, Lord Asriel, Master of Jordan, and so forth; this instead was replaced with a few minutes of monologue, and if you happened to sneeze you would miss the explanation of daemons (which is integral to the plot) they could have included the catacomb exploration to explain that but alas they clipped that as well. And what about Lord Asriels visit, why change who tried to poison him? and what happened to the trepanned head of Stanislaus Grumman? This was a powerful scene in the book, but it became a 2 minute meeting on screen. Also, I don't know about you but I pictured Lord Asriel as this big powerful looking man that commanded a room, not quite Daniel Craig.",/review/rw1804653/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2007,motta80-2,8," Really fun, engaging and fast moving fantasy spectacle
","I went in cynical about this, especially after the travesty that was the Narnia film, but i was quickly converted: it's great fun. A really entertaining and immersive film that intelligently builds a fantastical world that the uninitiated can marvel and thrill in. I have to say i haven't read the books so can't comment on a book to film comparison.",/review/rw1804653/?ref_=tt_urv

4 January 2019,punch_p,9," A beautiful, thought-provoking fantasy film.
","Suggesting at once Mrs. Coulter's devotion to her Magisterial mission, her fears of soulful and sensual embodiment, and yes, her own split self, her slap-and-hug of her damon all but stops the film's action.",/review/rw1804653/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2007,zardoz-13,8," ""The Golden Compass"" is Okay!
","The PG-13-rated, fantasy action thriller ""The Golden Compass"" poses no more of a threat to anybody's religious convictions than the ""Star Wars"" epics, the Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" the ""Harry Potter"" potboilers, or the old ""Flash Gordon"" serials. ""American Pie"" writer & director Chris Weitz has removed virtually all traces of Catholic theology from Philip Pullman's first novel in ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy. The controversy that hovers over ""The Golden Compass"" is that youngsters will enjoy the film so much that they will expose themselves to its blasphemous source material. Consequently, many may skip this movie more for its notorious novel than its larger-than-life, fantasy laden elements that are integral to such epics. Indeed, New Line Cinema has dreams that ""The Golden Compass"" will spawn another blockbusting ""Lord of the Rings"" style trilogy. This $180 million dollar epic boasts a top-notch cast that includes Christopher Lee, Derek Jacobi, Eva Green, Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Tom Courtenay, and a heavily mustached, Stetson-clad Sam Elliot as a footloose, six-gun toting cowboy/aviator. Not surprisingly, the drawling, down-home Elliot steals every scene in which he appears. Although it isn't as violent as ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, ""The Golden Compass"" is considerably more terrifying than the ""Harry Potter"" movies. The animated animals in ""The Golden Compass"" are no more realistic than those in ""The Chronicles of Narnia."" However, when the huge ice bears tangle at the half-way point of this 113 minute movie, you'll want to retreat a row or two.",/review/rw1804653/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2007,Dr_Coulardeau,10," Let's revisit the wonderlands of girls
","We are invited to revisit so many old tales like The Wizard of Oz and his Dororthy, or Alice and her Wonderland, or Snow-white and her bad step mother or Cinderella and her own bad stepmother. We must admit we are coming back from very far when we look at the most traditional image of women, or girls, in fairy tales and other children's stories. Think of Little Red Riding Hood who sleeps with a wolf, or Sleeping Beauty who cannot but prick her finger on the first spinning wheel she meets. This tale is for girls and this tale is built on a couple. On one side the bad guy, Marisa Coulter, and on the other side the good girl, Lyra. Refreshing. To make it modern and charming the author adds two elements. First animals who are fascinatingly good on the good side and outrageously bad on the bad side, with the polar bears in between, good or bad according to the king they have. Animals have always fascinated children. Then some good special effects to make the movie a dreaming machine with all types of possible fantasies and visions beyond the surface of things. The film is thus conceived as a mirror handed and stretched out to girls for them to fall in the Wonderland it proposes. At the same time it is modern too and tries to get the boys in the theaters by having some good battles, particularly the general one between Marisa Coulter's army and the gypsies who are on the right side and helped by the bears. There definitely is some charm in this film and girls are coming back to the forefront after a long long absence from it. Dorothy and Alice were so long ago. Unluckily we will have to waif for some time if we want to know whether Lyra will save her father or not. That's the only thing I regret. The general meaning is that a child, a girl as well as a boy, must remain rebellious and must disobey orders from adult authority because that adult world is hiding the truth of life and is aiming at cutting these children off (castrate them in a way) from their wild, free and imaginative animal spirits. We have to save children from normalization and standardization, so that they can forever see the cosmic dust that surrounds us and follow the tracks of the golden compass of their imagination and dreams.",/review/rw1804653/?ref_=tt_urv

6 December 2007,Prichards12345,2," A not-so-subtle knife to the novel

4 December 2007,richard-kurtz,4," Good acting and special effects. Poor storytelling
","I have not read the book so I can't comment on how close the movie follows it. However, as a movie, it is so poorly edited to be barely comprehensible. The whole movie seems like every other scene has been cut out. Characters and situations are not explained, relationships are not developed, and the plot is left with gaping holes. Fans of the book will, no doubt, be able to fill in the details. For the rest of us, I would not bother. This is a shame because the acting is good and well-cast. The special effects are equally impressive. If the movie had lasted another hour, it probably would have been terrific. Hopefully, a director's cut will be released some day that redeems this travesty.",/review/rw1804653/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2007,zetes,3," I, for one, loathed it
","An unmitigated disaster. It's a charmless Lord of the Rings cash-in. I believe that the producers had a lot to do with its failure. New Line Cinema desperately wanted a new fantasy franchise, and I imagine they demanded that this one come in under two hours so they could have more showtimes. The film is nothing but exposition and plot, moving breathlessly between locales and introducing scads of characters for whom I couldn't give a rat's ass. We're never allowed to know any of these people, not even the protagonist, a precocious preteen played by Dakota Blue Richards. Things happen so quickly and dialogue is delivered so rapidly, I felt like I was watching Speed Racer. I've heard the novel is actually quite good. I imagine it's better than this, but I was rather annoyed at one major conceit of Philip Pullman's universe: every human being on his alternate Earth has a spirit animal, called a daemon, that follows them around. This idea allows the filmmakers, at any rate, to be lazy. When they want to tell us a character is bad, their daemon is a snake or a beetle, or a filthy monkey. When they're good, they make them something noble, like a bird or a tiger or something. This is just really bad storytelling. The film, of course, ends with plot strings showing, letting us know that there will be sequels. Even though the film has already tanked, they'll probably make them anyway. I certainly won't be in attendance. You shouldn't make the initial mistake of seeing this one.",/review/rw1804653/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2008,23skidoo-4,9," A terrific film
","It looks to me as if The Golden Compass is one of those films that will attract a range of opinions. In fact it has a number of things stacked against it. It's based upon a very popular book, whose fans will be upset if it's anything less than a dramatized transcript of the text (see some of the reactions to the Lord of the Rings trilogy for similar examples); it's based upon a series of books that are controversial to people who think they're anti-religion; and, being the first part of a planned trilogy of films, it's not a standalone movie.",/review/rw1804653/?ref_=tt_urv

The general public's rating might not be so high but if you have the option, this is a good movie to watch.
