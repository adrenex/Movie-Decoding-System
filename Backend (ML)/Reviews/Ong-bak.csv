1 August 2016,Hitchcoc,6," Stretching the Body Where No One Has Gone Before
","This is not a terrible movie, as some have said, but it seems ordinary by today's standards. It is mostly action with little intellect. Why these guys go off on this mission with such recklessness is beyond me. They get themselves in an incredibly untenable situation through their own carelessness. The one thing that so many of these movies never address is the wear and tear on the human body that seems acceptable. People are thrown against walls, drop from great heights, and bounce back without a broken bone or a concussion. These aren't superheroes; they are flesh and blood. The other thing is that the designs of the evil force are never abundantly clear. To create suspense, we need to have a better understanding of the threat. And don't tell me that it was explained. I know it was, but it needs to be reinforced. As things came to a head, I kept thinking back to what exactly the importance of that object was. Many cheap tricks and close calls are gratuitous. I'm a real fan of the whole Trek canon and so this wasn't what I had hoped for.",/review/rw3509265/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2016,cherold,8," Terrifically fun popcorn action
","After the noisy and irretrievably stupid (though reasonably entertaining) Into Darkness, I wasn't desperate to watch this one, but when I finally did I was relieved to discover that it was even more enjoyable than the first film in the reboot, a rollicking adventure with terrific alien weapons, fun McCoy/Spock repartee, a promising newcomer alien, and a lot of really excellent action scenes.

22 July 2016,planktonrules,6," Action, explosions and special effects....
","Whether you like the newest Star Trek movie will really depend a lot on what you like in a movie. If you love near-constant action, tons of amazing special effects and explosions, then there is more than enough to delight you. On the other hand, if you want a film that is more plot-driven and a multidimensional villain whose actions make any sense, then you are also in for a big letdown.",/review/rw3509265/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2016,claudio_carvalho,7," Entertaining Adventure
","The USS Enterprise arrives at the Starbase Yorktown for a leave of the crew and Kirk (Chris Pine) intends to be promoted to Vice Admiral to stay at Yorktown and has recommended Spock (Zachary Quinto) for his present position of Enterprise's Captain. However, the survivor from a spaceship called Kalara (Lydia Wilson) is rescued in a lifesaving pod and the Enterprise is assigned to bring the other survives from the distant uncharted planet Altamid. But they are attacked by a swarm of spacecrafts and the Enterprise is destroyed. The crew escapes in pods while the alien leader Krall (Idris Elba) seeks a relic called Abronath that Kirk has kept on board after an unsuccessful diplomatic mission. Krall captures the crew while Spock and Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) team up with the native Jaylah (Sofia Boutella), who is a skilled engineer that lives in an ancient spaceship from the Starfleet that is stranded in the planet. Meanwhile Kirk, Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and Kalara look for the Abronath in the partially destroyed saucer section. They discover that Kalara is part of Krall's army but they succeed to escape from Krall's warriors and stumble upon Jaylah and their friends. Now the group intends to save the Enterprise's crew and return to Yorktown.",/review/rw3509265/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2022,RandomTard,5," A lot of action and a very thin story

18 August 2016,jrarichards,8," Not bad
","Those of us who know and love Star Trek are fully aware of the enormous wealth of its universe (indeed several parallel universes, and even recently this reimagined timeline that is anathema to some, but acceptable to others including myself). The whole comprises tens of films and hundreds of episodes in many series, and even life-imitates-art aspects like comments made by makers and stars at Conventions years later! This all has the paradoxical effect (also very visible with series like the BBC's Dad's Army) that the version we hold in our imaginations is now always likely to be richer and more meaningful and greater than any individual installment - past or present - that we actually get to see. And that is as true of ST ""The Original Series"" as it is of Abrams's new offering ""Beyond"", not least given that many of the Kirk-Spock-Scott-McCoy outings from the 3rd season of the ""Original"" were weak, and only erased as turkeys from our memory by reappearances of the original cast in great films like STIV and STVI.",/review/rw3509265/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2016,zardoz-13,9," ""Star Trek Beyond"" Is A Blast!!!
","""Fast and Furious"" director Justin Lin never lets the momentum slacken in ""Star Trek Beyond"" despite the formulaic Simon Pegg & Doug Jung screenplay that delivers a lot of the right stuff during its warp-drive running time of two hours and two minutes. A multitude of melodramatic moments with surprises and suspense galore ensue as Captain James T. Kirk and the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise triumph over tragedy. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, John Cho, Simon Pegg, and the late Anton Yelchin must have had fun making the 13th ""Star Trek"" saga because they work so well together that it doesn't matter what they're doing. Basically, the ""Beyond"" in the title refers to the uncharted territory that our indestructible heroes and heroine must negotiate before they can vanquish a megalomaniacal villain and preserve the status quo. Mind you, I didn't fear that Kirk, Spock, Bones, Uhura, Sulu, Scotty, and Chekov would die and that their wicked adversaries would perish. What I liked about ""Star Trek Beyond"" was the way everybody in the crew contributed to the ultimate success of their mission. None of the main cast were neglected or given the short shrift. One character has been altered. Aside from generating controversy on the Internet about Mr. Sulu's sexual proclivities, the rest of the Enterprise crew remains essentially the same, and you care as much about them as what occurs around them. Similarly, the giddy action unfolding in ""Star Trek Beyond"" was sufficient to race your pulse, whiten your knuckles, and get caught up in this spectacular epic. Cinematographer Stephen F. Windon, production designer Tom Sanders and make-up designer Joel Harlow all deserve kudos for their outstanding work. Two settings—the Nebula and the Yorktown space colony—looked sensational by any science fiction movie's standards. As villains rate, the reptile-faced Krall provides more than enough obstacles with which Kirk and his crew must contend, and Krall's unhinged plan to wreak havoc is sufficiently audacious. Nevertheless, Krall isn't half as memorable as Benedict Cumberbatch's Khan in director J.J. Abrams' superior sequel ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" ",/review/rw3509265/?ref_=tt_urv

26 August 2016,ericstevenson,8," I knew it would be dedicated to Leonard Nimoy
","I admit that this chapter wasn't as good as the first two, but it was still quite enjoyable. The best part about this movie is how utterly beautiful it is. The special effects are wonderful and everything is so nice just to look at. There's always fine details and creative execution. The best parts are still probably when the various crew members get separated. This is what makes a franchise as big as ""Star Trek"" so much fun. It's just great to see how the characters interact and play off of each other. I couldn't get any synopsis out of this film here other than the characters going somewhere new and fighting a new enemy. Don't most characters do that? ",/review/rw3509265/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2016,Marthian80,6," A solid and entertaining journey
","With two great movies under it's belt, the latest installment in the Star Trek reboot has some big boots to fill. I was skeptic when I heart J.J. Abrams was not directing it and the writing was done by Simon Pegg and Doug Jong. Fortunately, it turned out to be a solid trek film.",/review/rw3509265/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2016,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,9," ""Star Trek Beyond""- One of the best in the franchise. Proves that the beloved series can succeed even with a tonality leaning more towards action and adventure.
","Since J.J. Abrams rebooted the beloved and iconic series ""Star Trek"" in 2009, fans of the decades old franchise have been hotly divided. Abrams tale of a younger Enterprise crew certainly had a set of more modern sensibilities, and many long-time followers felt that the new tonal and stylistic leaning towards action and adventure over heady sci-fi morality alienated them. It was similar... yet just different enough to drive some away, while others embraced it. This divide was further fueled by the follow-up ""Into Darkness"", a loose retelling of the earlier ""Wrath of Kahn"", which again placed emphasis on explosions and fisticuffs over the complex tale of revenge that inspired it.",/review/rw3509265/?ref_=tt_urv

31 August 2016,scottshak_111,8," Yet another story, thoughtful like the prequels!
","The beauty of Star Trek Beyond lies in its pensive narration. It will let you resonate alongside the musings of its characters. For once you will truly fathom the importance of USS Enterprise in the lives of Trekkers. You will get to witness the rudimentary lost Franklin up and running. You will see why a job needs to be done with a proper explanation, with an optimal aftermath. In short, everything is in place.",/review/rw3509265/?ref_=tt_urv

21 July 2016,aharmas,10," This went where the others haven't gone before
","From its beginning ""Star Trek Beyond"" shows us how good movies are made. In a genre that has been largely ignored by people who evaluate movies and decide what is an example of great cinema, this one propels itself to the top of the heap, science fiction or otherwise. ""Beyond"" has learned from the previous entries. It doesn't have a boring moment, and it is built on a solid and entertaining script. The film explores important themes and originates from the one line that we have associated with ""Star Trek"" for 50 years now... to go where no man has gone before.",/review/rw3509265/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2017,TheLittleSongbird,5," Looks good, but lots of big chaos and loud noise and no brains or soul
","While it was not a perfect series (William Shatner's overacting, less than great production values and an iffy Season 3), the original 'Star Trek' series was a genre landmark and hugely influential and ground-breaking, also a mostly great series in its own right especially for the characters, the relationships and Leonard Nimoy's Spock.",/review/rw3509265/?ref_=tt_urv

However, with Star Trek Beyond, the Star Trek universe looks futuristic once again, spectacular action sequences and outlandish locations..., this is the Star Trek we all thought we loved, but it's only now we can actually say we love it.

22 July 2016,sedativchunk,9," They finally satisfied this old-school trekkie!!!!
","I am a trekkie who has watched everything Star Trek related from the past 50 years including every film and TV show. Although I've enjoyed the rebooted films, they never quite had the same magic as the originals. Until Star Trek Beyond, that is! Star Trek Beyond is the third installment in what is being called the ""Kelvin timeline"" of Star Trek with the rebooted universe of Kirk's storyline. Compared to Star Trek 2009 and ""Into Darkness"", this film felt astronomically more like a Star Trek film. I was absolutely blown away; what I thought was going to be a mindless, action-oriented Star Trek movie, was actually a brilliantly written and directed Star Trek film that felt more than fitting in the Star Trek universe.",/review/rw3509265/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2016,Dragonsouls,8," A very good stand-alone Star Trek episode, rather than part 3 of a movie trilogy
","I'm a 39 year old die-hard Star Trek fan. I've seen every episode of every series. I loved The Motion Picture. I loved Final Frontier. Heck, I even loved Nemesis. Star Trek Beyond was a very good entry in the Star Trek film universe. I would compare it to Nemesis, in that it felt like something you'd get in the midst of a season of a Star Trek series rather than something written for the big screen. Don't get me wrong, the film was epic, but budget aside, the script was small-screen material.",/review/rw3509265/?ref_=tt_urv
