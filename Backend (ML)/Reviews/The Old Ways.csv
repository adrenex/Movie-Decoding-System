6 January 2008,gavin6942,6," Devon Sawa as a Pee-Wee Football Star... and Rick Moranis
","As children, the O'Shea brothers were night and day: one a geeky little wimp and the other a popular football player. As adults, the trend continued and the football player was now a popular coach with a successful car dealership. But when the wimp's daughter gets rejected from her uncle's football team, the brothers must face off: wimps versus jocks. It's an underdog story!",/review/rw6380937/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2002,Aksarbengurl,8," You don't have to be good to have fun!
","The movie, the Little Giants is a fun and enjoyable movie.  I personally like that kids ambitions and determination.  The cast is great!  I watch it over and over because of Devon Sawa.  Him and the rest of the cast really acted their parts incredibly. I just can't get enough of this great movie!",/review/rw6380937/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 1999,Apolla,," OK, So this is actually good
","Amazing. This is a good movie. It can be a little bit sappy, but it can mean a lot. You can quite easily psycho-analyze it to death, but if you just sit down, watch and enjoy, it's a good film. Becky/Icebox's conflict between being the two sides of herself, the tomboy and the girl is something a lot of girls have been through. And who wouldn't when the object of affection is Devon Sawa? There are decent performances all round, and it might not be destined to be a classic, but it's not a bad movie. In fact, it's a very good movie.",/review/rw6380937/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2006,hessian823,7," I think it's fun
","This movie is just fun. It has a good message but its well crafted so as not to make it seem preachy as so many children's movies can be. I was 16 when this movie came out and I like it then and I like it now. How can anyone be opposed to a movie where the little guy proves that he can make it against the best. It's the American dream. While I certainly would not nominate this picture for an Oscar it is fun. This nice thing about this movie is that its pretty relevant for kids today so it has kind of a timeless quality to it. If you have kids or you are a big kid (like me) and feel like having a little light film fare, check it out, I think you'll enjoy it.",/review/rw6380937/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2019,ironhorse_iv,6," It's time to wake up, the sleeping giant. I think, this long forgotten kid's movie from the 1990s is still worth tacking. It's rewatchable.
","Inspired by an early 1990s McDonald's ad about Pee-Wee Football that ran during the Super Bowl & 1992's sport movie ""Mighty Ducks' with a similar premise. This 1994 family sport comedy about an underdog ragtag peewee football team challenging another more advance team is still somewhat amusing to me, even after all these years. Yes. While, I do know, this film might not be a huge touchdown as it once was. Nevertheless, it's still a guilty pleasure of mine. Directed by Duwayne Dunham for the most part & written by James Ferguson and Robert Shallcross. The film does overused the 1976's film 'Bad News Bears' sport formula a little bit, too much. It does have some really, dated one dimensional shallow stereotypical children characters like the fat kid that eats & fart all the time, the geeky weak looking nerd with oversize glasses, and overdramatic tomboy girl. Some of the slapstick scenes, including them, could be tiresome and annoying to watch, especially during the bumbling practice antics & the big game showdown. Still, there is no need for unnecessary roughness. ""Little Giants' ragtag bunch of misfits are very likeable. All the child actors portraying them, are decent enough to care about, even if some of the conflict involving them, seem forced, like Becky O'Shea (Shawna Waldron) getting mad at her father, Danny (Rick Moranis) for not treating her to the social norms of the day, despite the fact, that forming a rival football team was originally her idea. As for the adult actors. I found Moranis as the team's coach, alright to watch. However, his off and on love relationship with Patty Floyd (Susanna Thompson) was a bit forced & not needed. The whole thing is a little bit more awkward to watch, as his daughter has a crush on Patty's son, Junior (Devon Sawa) as well. If Danny marries Patty; yikes, talk about highly cringe-worthy. It will seem a bit incest like. Not good. Better, just to scrap Danny's crush, out of the picture. Despite that, Moranis gave a lot of heart to this otherwise, highly cartoony movie. However, the best actor in this film has to go with Ed O'Neill as Danny's older brother, over the top smarty football fanatic, Kevin O'Shea. He was amazing in this role. He had some of the best one-liners & insults. It's like if Al Bundy really did get to live up to his football fantasies, past scoring four touchdown in one game in high school. The jokes involving him, were mostly funny. However, some of them haven't aged well. Jokes like him, being arrested for peeping at children are cringe-wringing. Despite the detours into immature humor, the movie does upholds some positive messages, namely that all type of people can play football if they want, regardless of their talent level, gender, age or race. However, maybe the film should had portray the underdog team having more respect of game, by not, making them, cheated. After all, that's the villain's job, yet they barely do, that, besides Spike Hammersmith (Sam Horrigan). Instead, it's the protagonists that do all the dastardly things. Like how can it, be fair friendly-competition, if many of hold and facemask penalties made by the Giants, were uncalled for throughout the game? Better yet, how was the acid indigestion pills part, not an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty? Are the refs that blinded!? I guess so. They didn't notice that one of the team has a player trying to use an illegal sticky tar type substance. The game should had been throw out, just for that! Regardless, I didn't mind the notorious ""The Annexation of Puerto Rico"" fumblerooski climax of the film, as there were several variations of the play that were legal at the time. Since then, peewee football has made the move outlawed. Regardless, overall: This movie still score points with me. It was entertaining from start to end. I even dig the cameos from multiply NFL players; including John Madden, but it was a bit jarring to see Emmitt Smith help the Giants, despite playing for the Dallas Cowboy, most of his career. In the end, while the movie might not be a masterpiece. The film is decent enough to watch & have some fun. So, go see it. Don't drop the ball. You will thank me, tomorrow.",/review/rw6380937/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2002,CharlesVonFunhammer,," Who are we doing it for? the kids, that's right.
","If you don't like the little giants on some level, then you're a robot.  I know robots, don't be that guy.  The little giants is cute, it's fun, and it's funny.  It's about the kids who ""weren't good enough"" to make the select team, and who form their own team.  Plotwise, there is nothing new about the film, and really, you're not going to be impressed by the ""art of cinema.""  But put yourself there.  Tell a child he isn't good enough, I dare you.  It's a good family story about triumph and about overcoming the obstacles life throws at us, even at a young age.  These aren't college kids, or pros, they're not even teenagers.  The story is warm, inviting, sweet, and funny.  Enjoy this film.  Watch it with your kids, watch it with people you love, and do it for the kids.  Peace.",/review/rw6380937/?ref_=tt_urv

","In Urbania, Ohio, former football star Kevin O'Shea (Ed O'Neill) is the arrogant coach of the Peewee football team, the Urbania Cowboys. He is constantly living in his former glory. His brother Danny O'Shea (Rick Moranis) has always lived in his shadows. Danny's tomboy daughter Becky 'Icebox' O'Shea (Shawna Waldron) is the best player of the lot but uncle Kevin won't pick a girl. Becky starts a team with the other rejects and her father as the coach. There can only be one team representing the town in the state championship and they decide to play one playoff game. The rejects recruit various misfits and then they find Junior Floyd (Devon Sawa) as the star quarterback.

6 January 2017,Hitchcoc,5," Gee, I Wonder What's Going to Happen!
","I'm not going to trash this movie. It's another example of how we all like to root for underdogs. Rick Moranis's team of misfits fills a bill that has been filled over and over and over. There are the organize guys, the team of villains. They have the nice uniforms and they have learned to play at a high level. Not only that, they seem to always have that quality that we love: they make fun of our poor guys. Of course, our guys have a couple of skinny kids with broken glasses and an overweight one who passes gas, enough to make another team pass out. Anyway, since this is just kind of harmlessly contrived sport, it works at its appropriate level. Remember, in the forties, people cheered as Harpo Marx broke every rule in football. It was all good fun anyway.",/review/rw6380937/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2008,lee_eisenberg,7," slightly more interesting than most of these sorts of movies
","Mostly, ""Little Giants"" is the average movie in which against all odds a ragtag team takes on the big guys (others in this vein include ""The Mighty Ducks"" and ""The Big Green""). But I thought that in the end, it did come out slightly more interesting than the average such flick (maybe because of what happens at the very end). Maybe Rick Moranis (""Ghostbusters"") and Ed O'Neill (""Married...with Children"") in the roles improve the quality.",/review/rw6380937/?ref_=tt_urv

","I loved this movie the first time I saw it in 3rd grade and I still love it. I'm not a big fan of sports based movies, but this movie I adore. Despite being a movie about football, it's a great movie for girls. Icebox kicks butt on the field but still has to deal with crushes. Not to mention it's great how she's discriminated against at first for being a girl, but then comes out on top as the best player in the entire movie, beating every guy who didn't think she could to it. The O'Shea brothers get some good banter going, but mostly it's about Icebox. It's a great movie. I love it to death.",/review/rw6380937/?ref_=tt_urv

",I adore this movie and I have it on VHS. I do wish they could put it on DVD. It's about football more like a pint size Dallas Cowboys. They do have guest appearance from Mr. Madden and Emmitt Smith. It's so funny and great for a family movie. No voilence except the roughness of the players. I give it a thumbs up. The cast are wonderful. It's a family movie.,/review/rw6380937/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2005,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,5," Surprisingly, it's not completely unbearable
","First off, let me make one thing perfectly straight: the one reason I saw this movie was to experience the rarity of Ed O'Neill in a leading role. I've watched Married With Children every chance I got the last 3-4 years, and ever since the first episode I saw, I wanted to see O'Neill in other roles, preferably in films. That's why I saw The Bone Collector, it's why I saw K9 and it's why I, against better judgment, saw this movie. OK, now that I've got that out of the way, let me make a point out of the fact that I really, really don't care for children's films. Yes, yes, I know, this is a ""family film""... but that's really semantics, now isn't it? The reason the movie was made so kiddie-like wasn't to make it possible to show it to 'families', it was to make it acceptable viewing material for children. Face it, this is the kind of film that the parents rent for the kids if they want to have a night out or they just want to make absolutely sure that they won't be bothered by them for the next two hours or so. This really isn't that attractive a film choice for anyone over the age of 10. Apart from that, honestly, it's not all bad. Sure, it's a typical, predictable underdog tale glorifying one of the worlds most violent, ridiculous sports, but it's not entirely bad, and at least it's not another dreaded ""kids taking care of the adults' problems"" children's film. The plot is not the least bit original, but it's not bad. There seemed to be too many undeveloped subplots, though. The pacing is pretty good, despite my inherent hatred of kiddie flicks, I was rarely bored. The acting is mostly bad, but that's probably because it's a minor kids flick where most of the characters are children. O'Neill and Moranis are good, as are most of the other adults in the film. The humor is mostly juvenile and childish, but this is a children's film, so it's not like that's a big surprise. And at least not all of it is bad. Something I was surprised at was how credible and non-clichéd the characters were, despite many of them being stereotypical and more than half of them not even being properly fleshed out. I didn't hate O'Neill's character, even though he was Moranis's nemesis. Really, the film was far less mean-spirited than the usual children's film. It didn't rely too much on gross-out comedy, either. Honestly, for what type of film this is, you could do much worse. I don't know... if you need a children's film, keep this one in mind as a possibility. I recommend this mainly to kids and parents of sports fanatics. Fans of Ed O'Neill and/or Rick Moranis might want to check it out as well. 5/10",/review/rw6380937/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2002,tfrizzell,," Little Here.
","Two brothers (Rick Moranis and Ed O'Neill) act childish as they both coach pee-wee league football teams in their small town in this ho-hum little film that never does get off the ground. O'Neill, a former NFL star and town hero, has all the best athletes while Moranis gets all those rejects that were not good enough to make O'Neill's team. A typical under-dog story that focuses on younger age groups and ends up being down-right tedious for most who are over the age of 10. Below average overall. 2 stars out of 5.",/review/rw6380937/?ref_=tt_urv

","Little Giants (1994): Dir: Dwayne Dunham / Cast: Rick Moranis, Ed O'Neill, Shawna Waldron, Sam Horrigan, Devon Sawa: Recycled comedy about the smaller factor that achieves certain victory or acknowledgment. It is one of the countless rip-offs of The Bad News Bears. Misfit football team go through odd training so that they may challenge and defeat the team that rejected them. Puh-lease! Can anyone sense the bile? Rick Moranis plays the typical widowed father who brought his daughter up on sports and doesn't know how to approach her from a feminine standpoint. Ed O'Neill plays his rival brother in a variation of his Married...With Children role. They compete and eventually arrive at the predicted outcome. Shawna Waldron plays Moranis's daughter who can handle herself against the tough male competition. She tries out the feminine outlook but will realize that kicking butt on the football field is her thing. The worst performance goes unfortunately to Sam Horrigan who plays the embarrassing secret weapon player Spike who is a moron who speaks in the first person. Waldron will obviously send him flying on the field. This is also an early appearance of Devon Sawa. Dwayne Dunham does fine directing with a few visual elements but the film reworks tired themes such as teamwork and friendship that seem distant in this dying genre.

","When I was little, this was one of my favorite movies. Now I'm watching it like 10 years later, and I still enjoy it. I could really relate to Becky and her struggles. I had a crush on Junior the cute quarterback. I could really see Danny and Kevin as brothers. I laughed at everything. I also love football. But make sure when you watch it you don't watch it on TV because they cut so much out of the original movie. This is a great film about the struggles of growing up with some comedy.

23 March 2007,mtr0118,7," The Super Bowl for active kids...
","Watching this comic film about two brothers facing each other on the football field as coaches was very humorous, especially Ed Oneal's Kevin Oshea. His attitude nearly resembled a combination of Mika ditka and Tom Landry. No wonder why Rick Moranis' Danny told him off, ""Who the hell do you think you are? Vince Lombardi? These are kids."" That was probably the line that lay-ed out the plot of the picture. The Ice Box was nearly cute as she had her crush on her own QB. It was very nice to see Hall of Famer John Madden do a cameo appearance as he got lost on his way to Canton, Ohio.If the action on the field would of been filmed as detailed as in Bend in on Beckham(2004) Little Giants would have been really for everybody's enjoyment especially since this film is most possibly aimed at younger audiences.

","I was a kid when this family sports comedy was released, eight years old to be specific, so it's a film I could have seen as a kid, only I never even heard anything about it back in the 1990's. I never knew it existed until sometime within the past couple years, and even then, I still wouldn't have discovered it if it hadn't been for now retired Rick Moranis playing the starring role here. I certainly wasn't expecting ""Little Giants"" to be too hilarious or original, judging by what I had learned about it, but since I knew it was more popular than probably a number of other films like this, there was a chance that I could at least find some good moments in it.

5 June 2006,MulhollandGirl,10," I still love to watch it!!
","I never expected this movie to contain life-altering dialog or include Oscar-caliber performances, and I think that is why I love it so much. I don't have the hardest life on the planet, but I do work, and go to college full-time, and now I am also starting to apply to grad schools. So sometimes I just want to sit down and watch a film where I don't have to think. I can just sit back, relax, laugh at a few corny jokes, and root for the good girls and guys. So on days when I am tired of all the stress I love to pop in a movie like The Little Giants. It really has a cute plot. A dad wants the best for his daughter, his brother doesn't pick her for his football team even though she is really good, so he starts his own team with a mix of kids that normally wouldn't be picked for any sports team. Even though his team doesn't boast the brawn of his brothers, his little giants have big hearts and a lot of will. With a few little love stories in the mix, and of course an event that seems to spell doom for the little giants, this is a really fun, enjoyable film that is appropriate for the whole family.
