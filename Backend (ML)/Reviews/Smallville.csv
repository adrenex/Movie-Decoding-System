16 July 2021,koofasa,10," So disappointed there will be no season 3
",Today's choices for decent dramatic programming is very spotty so when I saw that Mindhunter was canceled I couldn't be more disappointed. This was an excellent show about the start of the FBI's profiling program. It was well made and acted and now it's gone. The first two season were great though so it is definitely worth watching. There were no story lines that required a third season to wrap up so you won't feel cheated when you realize season two is the end. This show was about the criminals and how they were profiled rather than the FBI agents who did the profiling. It is still a 10 star show even without a third season.,/review/rw7079665/?ref_=tt_urv

","Mindhunter is one of the better shows I've seen in some time! I've read some people think it gets slow at times but that's only because they're building the story and characters but it absolutely pays off. This series is so well done, from the acting to the directing to the writing to the etc, etc! Everything about this show is great!",/review/rw7079665/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2018,gogoschka-1,8," Fascinating, Suspenseful Drama Exploring The Origins Of Criminal Psychology And Profiling
","For those of you who came here looking for something like 'Se7en', because you thought, well, it's from David Fincher and it's about serial killers, I have bad news: this is not that kind of show. But if you came here looking for something more like 'Zodiac', because you thought, well, it's Fincher producing a show about people investigating serial killers, you might indeed find something you like. And if you appreciate long-form storytelling focusing more on human drama than on action scenes, AND you're a bit of a science nerd on top of that (and by that I'm also implying you don't mind watching a show where people are talking most of the time), then, my friend, you are in for a treat.",/review/rw7079665/?ref_=tt_urv

","This fictionalized show about the development of 1970's police forensic psychology and profiling is brilliant. It takes a premise, which could have been a documentary, and develops it around fictional and real characters. The scripts and storyline is brilliant. The acting by the main characters, especially the two leads, is fantastic. The Direction by David FIncher and others is movie quality. The 1970's attention to detail is just stunning. The interweaving of the brilliant role outs of real serial killers is just amazing to watch. The people and the scripts surrounding Manson, the Co-ed Killer, BTK, the Son of Sam and more are just fascinating. The is a thoughtfully constructed show and one of Netflix's finest additions. I wish I had watched it sooner.",/review/rw7079665/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Brilliant!!
","Mindhunter is such a great show. Just read through the reviews to see what most people think about it. This is not your average cop show. It follows FBI agents Holden Ford (Jonathan Groff) and Bill Tech (Holt McCallany) as they attempt to understand and catch serial killers by studying their minds and psyches. This is the start of modern day serial killer profiling. It really digs in to why these monsters do the terrible things they do. I've read some people think it gets slow at times but that's only because they're building the story and characters but it absolutely pays off. Everything about this show is award worthy...the acting, writing, directing, cinematography, production, etc, etc.! One of its creators is David Fincher (Seven, Zodiac, Gone Girl, The Social Network, etc). It has the same feel of a lot of his work so if you're a fan of his then you'll be a fan of this show.",/review/rw7079665/?ref_=tt_urv

","I object! Throughout the two seasons, there are snippets of a guy wearing a girdle and a mask doing creepy things with a doorknob-- WHAT IS HIS DEAL??? Why does the show not follow through on this? I'm very upset about it. Season 3, guys! And Tench's wife and creepy adopted son-- GONE? Not even a note? There's another season 3.

4 September 2022,pkhall1,10," Please David Fincher read this:
","Mr. Fincher, Mindhunter is the greatest show ever created on TV. Please make another season. I know you're busy making a wonderful movies etc. But this show is just exceptional. Other than Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, I can't remember a TV series that has been so perfectly done as this. Your direction and the cast is so enjoyable. I have seen the series now seasons 1 and 2
three times and it just keeps getting better with each viewing. Hope you can find it within yourself to keep this going for many years coming. Every single actor that has played a notorious killer has been transformed into that person by your incredible make up team it is as if we are truly watching these people give their testimonies. It is very creepy that it is so believable, but that is just simply your incredible vision and direction. I think you probably the best modern day Director. Thank you so much again and praying for future episodes.",/review/rw7079665/?ref_=tt_urv

","Mindhunter is a 10 episode series on N'flix that hits a home run with me. First of all, David Fincher can do no wrong in my eyes, blending trance-like music with scenes that are unforgettable. He does this a few times and my goodness he's the master at it. Every scene, every line...well-constructed and nothing wasted.",/review/rw7079665/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm beyond fascinated by the study of the criminals as weird as they may sound so this hit the spot to me kinda like a delicious meal! The other thing is David Fincher the director of the pilot is one of my all time favorite humans/famous beings! Mindhunter has a wonderful tranquil ambient soundtrack throughout and immersive acting.

16 June 2020,andrewroy-04316,9," Mindhunter picks up speed each episode until it's irresistible by the meat of season 2
","The first four episodes or so are pretty slow and unremarkable, but if you stay with it, it rewards you handsomely. Even the slow start isn't bad or boring, it's just fine, solid psychological TV building up its characters (certainly less extreme in being frustrating and boring in its early build than Mr Robot was for me). Later into season 1 and particularly getting into season 2, the cases are deeper and character interactions are beautifully layered. I absolutely love Holden and Bill's characters, and both actors are exceptional. The show is about understanding violent criminal psychology at its core, but what made season 2 so wonderful was the way many other themes were seamlessly woven into the plot. It's all directly based on true events, so all the themes are practical. We get character relationship drama with Bill and Wendy having things going on, and we see the practical challenges of their work as bureaucracy, politics, race, and the legal system get in the way. The season 2 ending was absolutely perfect, as we see a resolution to the case but also see how unsatisfying and inconclusive it really was - can't we expect more out of those serving justice? Seeing the things that weigh heavy on each of the three characters, even after their supposed success, was the perfect bittersweet touch (Holden unsatisfied about the case, Wendy throwing the magazine out, and Bill finding that Nancy had left). I desperately hope more Mindhunter is made soon, because it is truly fantastic. Mindhunter has far and away the best editing of any show I've seen, and fantastic writing and cinematography to go with it. No plot thread is thrown out there and not returned to, and everything serves a precise purpose thematically. The visual intricacies of the show are a joy to watch. It's more of a thoughtful, thematically real-world relevant show than a procedural, but it's all the more unique for it. Highly recommended, Mindhunter is impeccably well made.",/review/rw7079665/?ref_=tt_urv

","I read the book by John Douglas (who consults to the show) some years ago...twice. Every now and then I get a memory or part of the book come back to me. This is very close to how I'd imagine the book made into a series - not a movie would look. For those that want a nicely tied up story each episode or answers for everything, you won't find it here.

","Once in a while really AMAZING series appear on tv. Mindhunter is one of them. Every aspect of the show is a perfect 10 - the ultimate essence of noir crime. Intelligent, dark, disturbing.
Why this show has not won every award possible is beyond me. The cast is top notch. Esp. Anna Torv's performance is outstanding. Cameron Britton who portrays Ed Kemper let u easily forget that it's a show. It feels so real, so raw. There are some more interviews with other suspects/killers, all let u peak into an abyss as cruel and dark as it can be. A twisted mind. If u are up for something truly unique and innovative in the usually rather stereotype crime bla, mindhunter is your antidote.",/review/rw7079665/?ref_=tt_urv

",This was a very good show. Unfortunately we can't trust Netflix.

","I hate it when people give reviews or ratings after half-assed watching just 2 or 3 episodes. Yes, Mindhunter is a slow burner and yes, it's not fast-paced or exciting. If you want that, go somewhere else. Mindhunter is a 'thinking piece' of work where you have to watch and see where it goes while having your mind whirring and contemplating the difficult questions the show poses. Why are serial killers so fascinating to us? The Ed Kemper in the show was just riveting, as were the other serial killers they interviewed. The main characters pose interesting questions and are complex individuals, and towards the end of the series this poses conflict. ",/review/rw7079665/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm spoiled for good quality TV shows that are intriguing and make me think while entertaining along the way. So many shows I watch the first episode and can't even get through it because its so predictable or cookie cutter. I'm excited I've found a new one to enjoy. And even though it is set in the 70s, its very relevant for today. Crazy takes on many forms. Back then it was ""sequence killers"" prior to term ""serial killer"" being used. Today its crazy mass shooters. I love Ford's desire to learn. I've watched 2 episodes and looking forward to the rest. And BTW the soundtrack is amazing!",/review/rw7079665/?ref_=tt_urv

","Two episodes in and I'm already hooked. Technically speaking, this series is very good (it's directed by David Fincher, of course it's good) and it stays true (so far) to the real-life crimes it was based on. I can't say the same for the characters, and how close they are to the people who really did this work, but considering their names are different and the book they adapted wasn't some sort of biography, most of their personal (love) lives must be fictitious or at least overtly dramatized.",/review/rw7079665/?ref_=tt_urv

",I wanted to see something like Zodiac for a long time and couldn't find something and then my friend suggested to watch this and my mind is blown. David Fincher gives something that literally no other person could give. It has a perfect pacing and the pilot is for character introduction and the second episode is due character development. And from the 3rd episode the series starts in a full fledged way and boom you get what you are looking for it's one of the best and very-very enjoyable. Fincher is the MVP here and he does his job perfectly. It's so good that I'm ready to beg Fincher to start it's production ASAP.,/review/rw7079665/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2017,insideout098,10," Breathtaking in its dept of character development
","To say that I am a fanatic about shows involving criminal psychology is a gross understatement. I am a veteran of the genre, and thus, easily bored with shoddy character sketch work and less than intelligently thought out plots. Mindhunter is everything but, and I mean everything. Every moment is monumental. The pauses are as riveting as the occasional action, like one gigantic tapestry, its beauty hinging on the the juxtaposition of patterns and colors nestled together. This is a show about the development of Behavioral Science as it relates to serial killers. One after the next the psychology of killers are unraveled through techniques that are routinely called into question, but vindicated, keeping the plot lines alive and well and the characters true to their core values. The interviews themselves are intense and unsettling, mostly because one has no idea what might happen when dangerous criminals are left unchained in a closed space with unprotected FBI agents. But how else would they gain their trust? This is one of the show's most distinctive elements, that you never know what will happen in the presence of almost unfathomable darkness. I honestly wondered to myself where they found the actors who portrayed these manipulative monsters. They were all so masterful, and this applies as well to all of the characters, both central or secondary. The tenth episode opened a door to new territory of psychological horror that I cannot wait to follow into the second season. The ONLY show in this particular genre on par with this one is the first season of True Detective. If you were a fan of that show, you'll love this. One final note, the female characters in Mindhunter are all strong, intelligent, insightful...and off putting. This may bother some, but understand the time frame and this begins to make sense. {edited after second viewing] After watching the entire series a second time, I have to say that I had some small issues with the second season. First, the Bill and Nancy Tench backstory got on my nerves. And that psycho brat kid who just sits and stares was just creepy and irritating. If that were my adopted kid, I'd give him back. As for Nancy and her obnoxious glaring and complaining, I'd leave her, too. I never felt that there was any connection whatsoever between the two. Second, while I love the origins of profiling serial killers, I found Holden to be a bit too easily led into situations a trained bureau agent would have avoided, if not found obviously suspicious. I'm also sorry that his profile was, for the most part, incorrect, given his almost supernatural insights into such things. As it turns out, the actual BTK killer does the work for him...or did he? We never see him die. We simply see the reenactment of one of his infamous fantasies. How this series wasn't green lit for a third season is beyond me.",/review/rw7079665/?ref_=tt_urv
