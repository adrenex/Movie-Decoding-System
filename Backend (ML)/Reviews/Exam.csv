26 April 2012,Wizard-8,," Breezy and acceptable fluff
","""Tower Heist"" is a movie that's never going to win awards. But if it's playing on your television during a rainy day, you will find it is an acceptable way to pass the time. And you'll find the movie has some positive features. Alan Alda makes for a good slimy villain, and Ben Stiller, Eddie Murphy, and Matthew Broderick (as well as their co-stars) make a likable bunch of people with a goal that you hope they will be able to reach. The actual heist has some unexpected twists as well as some genuine suspense. Certainly, the movie is not perfect. There are some parts of the movie when the movie seems to be missing footage, especially at the end where not all the plot points are resolved (though the two alternate endings on the DVD have this missing material that was for some reason removed from the theatrical print.) While I wouldn't say this is a movie to seek out, if you stumble upon the opportunity to see it, it will probably give you an acceptable amount of entertainment.",/review/rw2524395/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2015,bowmanblue,7," Average, but not necessarily bad
","Tower Heist is Ben Stiller's latest comedy where he plays the building manager of a New York high rise tower block. He regrettably invests him and his staff's pension money with a smooth-talking crook who lives in the top floor penthouse. Naturally, the crook wastes their money and they're left without a cent.",/review/rw2524395/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2014,SimonJack,7," Comedy and capers in the skyscraper
","""Tower Heist"" is a fun comedy, action and crime thriller. It's a chess game of life. The opponents are a band of employees who run a high-class apartment building in the heart of Manhattan, and the pent-house tenant who takes their pensions and savings to the cleaners. But, one caper deserves another, and the employees are on the rebound after the FBI get into the picture. ",/review/rw2524395/?ref_=tt_urv

13 April 2014,lesleyharris30,8," Not the Comedy Gold a Movie that Teams Stiller with Murphy Should Have Been,but it's Still Filled with Laughs,
","Tower Heist is a great movie with a well written storyline with a great comedic cast.I was certainly disappointed by this movie,it teams up two comedy actors who I am huge fans of,Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy,and on top of that it also stars Matthew Broderick and Casey Affleck,and while it is an enjoyable movie,I gave my hopes up on this being an outstanding comedy,because I expecting nothing more with a comedy cast like this,also it was Murphy's first adult comedy on years.It still is a really good comedy however,and the best performance certainly has to be Eddie Murphy,it was a great comeback to characters like his Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop characters,the much better and way funnier Murphy that I really missed,and this movie is certainly much better than the movies he's done in recent years (Meet Dave,Norbit,etc.) and I hope he realises after doing this film that these comedy suit him much more than family friendly ones.Tower Heist is a very enjoyable comedy that I would recommend to all fans of comedy,Eddie Murphy and Ben Stiller.",/review/rw2524395/?ref_=tt_urv

4 August 2012,julian-mumford,7," A rarity, a Hollywood comedy that is actually funny

8 May 2021,pawanpunjabithewriter,8," When 2 Legends meet
",It's a magnificent comedy movie that picks up right after 25 minutes of the start. Both actors including Ben Stiller were excellent and the movie was amazing through out. Crime + Comedy + 2 great actors is definitely gonna be the thing you're looking for.,/review/rw2524395/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2013,g-bodyl,8," Better Than Expected!
","Brett Ratner's Tower Heist is a much better film than anyone could anticipate. Brett Ratner is a critically-panned director so I never thought the ratings would be high as it is. This film has a stellar cast which provided great chemistry and over-the-top humor, a plot that actually has some relation to real-life, and just some cool stunts that you would have to suspend your beliefs of reality. In other words, it's a fun popcorn film to entertain amongst the award movies.",/review/rw2524395/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2011,Christian_Dimartino,8," Welcome back Eddie Murphey!
","It's been a while since we've seen Eddie Murphy... do anything decent. Sure, he was in Imagine that, an okay kids movie, but it feels like he has sort of given up. With Meet Dave and Norbit, it was just getting sad. So that's why Tower Heist, the new film from director Brett Ratner(Rush Hour, Money Talks) brought a big goofy smile to my face.",/review/rw2524395/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2011,StevePulaski,8," Wait, don't tell me!
","My favorite line in Tower Heist is uttered during one of the most climatic scenes in the film where a white truck is shipped out on the streets to create a diversion for the police. Upon realizing the truck is a diversion, the female FBI agent yells ""It's a diversion!"" This is one of those heist movies where when the characters aren't pacing back and force nervous or screaming at one another, they are stating the obvious.",/review/rw2524395/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2011,Shelly_T,7," A Very Entertaining Way to Pass the Time
",I didn't expect too much from this movie after watching the trailer. Judging from the cast and the trailer I thought that it would be at the very least a little entertaining or just an okay movie. It is actually very entertaining and the performances from the entire cast are solid. I laughed a lot and more than I expected. It also has quite a few twists and turns which I wasn't expecting and which should keep you interested. The chemistry between Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy is very good too and they both provide a couple of very memorable scenes. If you are looking for something to pass the time this movie would be a very good choice.,/review/rw2524395/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2011,ssvikas,4," Average fare; will fade out your memory in minutes
","Heist movies have hit the screens with regularity in every language and generation. You know how it all ends: the smart thieves get their booty despite all odds and twists. But, very few are actually smart and slick enough like an 'Italian Job' or an 'Oceans Eleven'. On a comparative rating, 'Tower Heist' doesn't even get close.",/review/rw2524395/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2016,Irishchatter,8," Good teamwork movie with Murphy, Brockerick and Stiller altogether!
","I honestly never expected that Eddie Murphy was going to play as a gangster criminal in this. He usually plays cheery good guys who plan to save the world but not this time! I found it interesting that big legends like himself, Ben Stiller and Matthew Brockerick were gonna be teaming up altogether by taking on a criminal risk. As they say, not all good guys have to be always act good all the time! ",/review/rw2524395/?ref_=tt_urv

After manager Ben Stiller loses his temper and damages a collector car Alda keeps in his penthouse, he, Casey Affleck, and Michael Pena are fired.

23 June 2019,nogodnomasters,9," THE MARSHALL SWINDLE
","The movie opens with a fast paced electronic sound track. We see Alan Alda, Ben Stiller, and a street smart Eddie Murphy in the first few minutes. Early on we know the film is fast paced and clever. Just seeing Murphy revive his street smarts type person is worth the price of admission. Ben Stiller is Josh Kovacs. He runs a very high priced apartment tower with a large staff. He is dynamic and pays attention to details. Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) is a financier and is one of the millionaire tenets who sits on the board of directors for the apartment building and runs their pension fund. Matthew Broderick plays Mr. Fitzhugh, who is currently broke and squatting in his over priced apartment. . . ""If you want me, I'll be living in this box.""",/review/rw2524395/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2012,thinker1691,7," "" If you must steal something, do it in broad daylight ""
","Brett Rather directs this hilarious story of Josh Kovaks (Ben Stiller) an uptown high rise apartment, manager who's principal tenant is Arthur Shaw, an unscrupulous multi-millionaire (Alan Alda). Greedy, callous and artificially sympathetic the rich guy attempts to flee the country, but is thwarted by the U.S. government which arrests him for securities fraud and tax-evasion. Although the F.B.I. is holding him, they are unable to recover his hidden fortune, which is closer than anyone imagines. When Kovac's discovers his hotel employees are also victims of Shaw's schemes, he assembles an amateur group of would-be thieves with the task of stealing from the rich and giving back to the poor, not realizing the difficulty of designing an elaborate robbery. With top actors like Eddie Murphy, Casey Affleck and Matthew Broderick the film becomes a comedic romp through uptown New York during the annual Macy's Day Parade. A good film, but one wonders if this movie isn't just another version of 'Ocean's Eleven.' All in all, it's still a fun time at the theater. ****",/review/rw2524395/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2012,reysia,7," Not just an ordinary comedy
","Tower Heist is a comedy. I know it just by looking the casts, especially Eddie Murphy. The real tipping point of the comedy is when Eddie shows up a lot and join the group. Other casts like Ben Stiller usually plays comedy with serious faces and as I predict, also in this movie.",/review/rw2524395/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2011,djensen1,6," Fun but a little flat
","Not as dull as its title suggests, but still somewhat flat caper flick. It has a consistent string of laughs, but never quite hits the heights. Brockerick's down-and-out businessman is a good start but lands few jokes, and the plotting seems to meander. Stiller is a highlight, and Affleck and Murphy are good solid, but Aldo is a standout.",/review/rw2524395/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2012,jdemo2008,8," Great Movie, better than I expected!
","I hadn't seen a good Eddie Murphy movie in some time and when I saw the trailer I thought it was going to be a very predictable story line. But on the contrary...it was fresh and very entertaining! The beginning kept me guessing how the plot was going to set up. Then, when it all came together, their plan started to unravel...It was nice to see Matthew Broderick acting again and in full quirk mode...He played a great nerd! Alan Alda was a joy to hate as the bad guy and Ben Stiller was his usual perfect lead man! The casting was perfect and the music kept the excitement going until the end! If you are looking for a fun, ""feel good"" movie with good acting, then this is a must see! Long live Robin Hood!!!",/review/rw2524395/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2018,jrarichards,8," Good-enough comedy with a touch of bite and quite a bit of eccentricity
","In Brett Ratner's comedy, a certain amount of homage is paid to ""The Lavender Hill Mob"", ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" and other classics as decent folk + one small-time criminal join together as one of the most unlikely gangs of thieves you've ever seen. And this is OK because they are kind-of in the right, looking for justice after being taken for a ride by a Wall Street businessman's Ponzi scheme.",/review/rw2524395/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2012,sddavis63,8," A Fun And Likable Cast Delivers
","After a rather slow and meandering start, I thought that once we got to the point of the movie at which the actual tower heist began to be planned, this picked up steam well and started to be quite funny. The last hour or so packs a lot of laughs, and while the end of the movie was in most respects a feel-good ending, the movie didn't lapse into a complete saccharine-filled conclusion by making sure that Josh (Ben Stiller) ended up in jail for his part in the heist. The last hour was very strong, and the ending was very good, and the first part (while a bit dry) was still good enough to hold my interest.",/review/rw2524395/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2020,UniqueParticle,10," Might be odd but I absolutely love Tower Heist I could watch it a 1,000 times
","I love the writing and every scene! The music is delightful throughout gives an uplifting vibe. Something about the way everything plays out is so amusing and entertaining! Ben Stiller, Eddie Murphy, Matthew Broderick, Casey Affleck, Micheal Pena, and Alan Alada are great to watch. I can't help but praise this movie enough, I'm pretty sure I'm among very few too.",/review/rw2524395/?ref_=tt_urv
