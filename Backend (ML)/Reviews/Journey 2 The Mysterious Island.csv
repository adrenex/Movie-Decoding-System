14 July 2018,planktonrules,7," Mind-blowing CGI and stunts....and okay story.
","I remember seeing the previews for ""Zatura: A Space Adventure"" back in 2005 and thinking that the premise for this one is pretty much ""Jumanji""....which it is. While not a sequel, the game clearly is a reworking of the original story. So, if you like one, you'll likely enjoy the other.",/review/rw4916812/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2005,gpeltz,8," Wonderful adventure
","It is rare when a movie transports me back to my childhood memories, reminding me of the time when playing games use to be fun. Adventures were limited by imagination, and Summer days were transformed into magic. ""Zathura"", directed by Jon Favreau, based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, came knocking on my door and invited me to come out and play.",/review/rw4916812/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2006,aimless-46,6," Kindergarten to Fifth Grade Unless You are a Kristen Stewart Fan
","Those who criticize ""Zathura"" for being a copycat ""Jumanji"" are apparently clueless about the Van Allsburg's books. ""Zathura"" is a sequel to ""Jumanji"", it is about what happened when the Budwing brothers opened the game box that Peter and Judy discarded at the end of ""Jumanji"". Early board games were often designed with two-sided boards so that the game pieces could be used to play two different games-usually of the same type. ""Zathura"" was the flip side of the ""Jumanji"" game board and the ones the brothers chose to play (because Walter did not like jungle games). So it is ""supposed"" to be like another ""Jumanji"".",/review/rw4916812/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2011,TheLittleSongbird,9," Simply great family entertainment
","I have often seen this compared to Jumanji, just for the record I love them both equally. About Zathura:A Space Adventure, as a family movie it is truly excellent. True, the role of the sister is rather clichéd, but a lot makes you not worry so much about it. Jon Favreau's direction is excellent, and the sense of childlike wonder featured so prominently here is delightful. There is a witty script, a highly imaginative story and a great fix of fun, scares and poignancy, it was wonderful to hear Frank Oz as the voice of the robot, Jonah Boo and Josh Hutcherson make a great duo and Dax Sheppard's astronaut provides the touching moment of the film, that of the revelation of his true identity. What made Zathura:A Space Adventure so good especially were the fantastic production values, a soundtrack that fitted perfectly with the film's tone and the gripping action. Overall, just great. 9/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw4916812/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2008,Chrysanthepop,," Jumanji in Space: Pretty Cool!
","I'm pretty much sure that if you've liked 'Jumanji' then you'll enjoy this one. As a kid, I loved 'Jumanji' and 'Zathura' does not disappoint at all. Of course, both movies are adaptations of books written by the same writer. I was watching it with my kid sister who was having a blast. The two main characters are two brothers who are probably 10 and 7 years of age. The kid actors are quite good and they don't overdo the cute act. However, Kristen Stewart is the caricature whiny older sister who doesn't care. Thankfully, her role is limited. The only directorial venture of Favreau I have seen was 'Made' which was a laugh out loud dark comedy, completely different from 'Zathura'. He does seem to know the kind of movies kids love and families can enjoy. He's moving to being more versatile as a director as he's done a fine job so far. The special effects are awesome. Just like the engaging weirdness in 'Jumanji'. The house floating outer space, the dim lighting in the house, the house breaking, the bicycle orbiting around the floating house...all work well and add to the amusement. Highly entertaining! Kids will love it! Therefore families will love it too!",/review/rw4916812/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2005,takatomon,8," jumanji for trekkies
","i was expecting this film to merely be a decent way to waste some time like it's predecessor, but zathura is better. it's just as wacky as jumanji, but just seems to make more sense.",/review/rw4916812/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2013,SnoopyStyle,7," Fun, lots of Fun
","Director Jon Favreau uses the same concept as Jumanji. A board game comes alive when it gets played. Danny (Jonah Bobo) and Walter (Josh Hutcherson) are two battling brothers who find an old mechanical board game called Zathura, and they start to play it. Only every move they make sends something crazy to happen. Their entire house gets launched into outer space. They, along with their sister Lisa (Kristen Stewart), must finish the game and return home.",/review/rw4916812/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2006,Nednehsa,8," Surprisingly nice. If I was a kid I'd have loved it........
","There are quite a few nice things about this film. In particular, Zathura is an aesthetically intelligent film. The makers did a great job of not relying too heavily on CGI; very thoughtful design and effects. The convincing use of miniatures, real sets and chaos/destruction really brought the story to life. True, its a kids movie. But not so much that it annoys, there's a timeless and attractive notion of adventure. Really hearkens back to the glory of 80's kids adventure movies. The film's gadgets and knick-knacks were great. The house and Zathura game-board were both characters in and of themselves, every bit as important as the actors (who did a fine job).

","My son (age 10) liked Jumanji and is an avid reader. When he learned ""Zathura"" would be the next Van Allsburg book to come to the screen, he made me promise we'd see it.",/review/rw4916812/?ref_=tt_urv

19 September 2006,watchmanz,10," Well worth the watch
","It's not often a ""kids movie"" will keep me entertained right through by Zathura did just that. The actors are excellent, there are plot twists, and it's just good old fashioned fun as well. I was pleasantly surprised when watching this movie and at the end I wished it had been longer. Jonah Bobo and Josh Hutcherson work extremely well together as the two lead characters and with special effects that are realistic (as realistic as a fantasy film can get anyway) the end result is an excellent movie for all ages. Jumanji was good but Zathura is great and I can highly recommend it to everybody. Take your kids to see it, take your parents to see it - take everyone to see it.",/review/rw4916812/?ref_=tt_urv

9 August 2006,bearingup,10," great family movie!
","Probably one of the best family movies I've ever seen. Lots of good clean fun, maybe a little bit scary for the youngest viewers, but not too scary for school age (I think). I intend to recommend it to my sister for her kids. I'm a big fan of Chris Van Allsburg's books. I enjoyed Polar Express a lot, but I loved Zathura. Definitely the best movie from his books to date. Almost as interesting as the movie itself was the making of the movie information from the DVD. I thought Josh was adorable, particularly how much he loved his stunts. I heartily recommend this movie. I watched it on a loan, now it's on my wish-list. Definitely a keeper for me!",/review/rw4916812/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2005,EmperorNortonII,7," ""Jumanji"" In Space
","""Zathura"" is a science-fiction movie directed by Jon Favreau, and based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg. ""Zathura"" is similar to ""Jumanji,"" which is also based on the work of Van Allsburg. In this story, two quarreling brothers discover an old board game in the basement, which launches their house into outer space. This movie does not quite have the scope of ""Jumanji,"" but it is still enjoyable. There is a lot of excitement, and the visuals are well done. The movie has a good retro science-fiction look. The story is adequate, teaching some lessons as it goes. At times, though, it might seam preachy. In the end, ""Zathura"" is still worth watching.",/review/rw4916812/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2006,enderbc,10," KIDS ONLY! (No adults allowed)
","If you're watching this show looking for science fiction, don't bother. This is a story in the grand old Buck Rogers vein. It's for KIDS. i never watched the show as a critical adult trying to find flaws in it or worrying about suspension-of-belief. i watched it as i used to when i was a kid, going to a Saturday afternoon matinée. Excited, thrilled at being in the theater... popcorn and pop in hand. Fidgeting in the seat until the lights dimmed. Then the anticipation... ready to enter into the story. i wasn't disappointed. The movie captured my imagination from start to finish. My advice; this is for kids only. If you're a grown-up, leave your adulthood at the door. If you enter into it as a kid you'll experience the wonder, the suspense, the thrills, the chills. ",/review/rw4916812/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2006,aerotrooper,9," Great for wholesome fun for today's kids.
",This is a very straight forward flick with great action sequences and great chemistry with the actors. Though some parts might be a little scary for some kid's the movie is never violent and no one ever get's hurt. There's a good dose of fun and it's engaging for adults also. Zathura is a rare film in that it's demographic isn't global in scope. I'm not sure how it would go over with young girls but I saw it with my brother and his kids (my nephew's) and we all were entertained. The special effects are not over the top and are well done. The pace is predictable but the scenes are not. Great movie for anyone with a good theater system. Fun movie for both kids and adults.,/review/rw4916812/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2010,bkoganbing,9," Not Over The Rainbow, But Out In The Galaxy
","Bearing no small resemblance to The Wizard Of Oz, Zathura is a really imaginative kid's film that can be enjoyed by adults also. There's also a nice moral lesson in there about family and the value of cherishing one's blood relations.",/review/rw4916812/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2007,JoeytheBrit,," Jumanji in Space
","Two typically irritating kids discover an old game called Zathura: A Space Adventure which propels them into a real-life space adventure involving comets, stranded astronauts, and lizard-like aliens called Zorgons. Stealing shamelessly from Jumanji, this film is loaded with special effects that can only distract from the dearth of any new ideas for a short time before the claustrophobic sets and constant bickering of the two protagonists wears the viewer down. Luckily for the kids, (one surly and annoying, the other cute and, well, annoying) they live in the only house in the US sturdy enough to withhold anything stronger than a gust of wind with a woman's name, because here they're subjected to repeated bombardment by meteors and space rockets as they frantically play the board game and learn the obligatory 'life lesson' on their increasingly dull adventure. Director Jon Favreau just doesn't know when to end a scene, so that supposedly suspenseful sequences (such as the attempt to retrieve the game from the Zorgon's spaceship) eventually just become tedious.",/review/rw4916812/?ref_=tt_urv

9 September 2006,DavidSim240183,9," Zathura is stratospheric fun!
","I've always had a certain affection for Jumanji. Granted the plot is on the slight side and it's carried by a barrage of special effects, but it still entertains, and its a lively romp. 10 years have passed, and we now have an almost unofficial sequel, with the same basic premise, but more fleshed out characters, and the action taking place this time in outer space. That film is Zathura.",/review/rw4916812/?ref_=tt_urv

6 November 2005,lovadoll,10," way better than i thought
",I went into Zathura expecting a bunch of crap but wow was i ever surprised.This movie is sooo cool it's scary.Being a 16 year old girl I only went to see this movie because my nephews wanted to see it and I ended up having more fun then they did.Zathura is a very different adventure film from the creator of the snore fest Jumanji.Unlike Jumanji this is much more fun and charismatic and is much easier to follow.Zathura is one of those family films that will turn out to be a classic like The Sandlot because it's just about the most entertainment a kid can get out of a movie.It is meant to be fun and wacky and successfully delivers what it set out to do.Zathura is a fun filled adventure for the whole family.So get to the theatre and enjoy Zathura 10 outta 10 all the way.,/review/rw4916812/?ref_=tt_urv

6 June 2019,vjnambu,9," Engaging space adventure film
","I am a big fan of Jon favreau and I watched zathura only for him. And he definitely kept his name. Zathura is sequel to jumanji narrating two brothers getting trapped in a board game titled zathura. You will hate the elder brother in the beginning for ill treating his brother. The younger brother is very cute and lovely. It has the thrill of jumanji but not fun maybe because of Robin Williams absence. Only drawback was its predictable. I also loved the sibling love shown in the last 20 minutes. On the whole, zathura is an entertaining space adventure family film.",/review/rw4916812/?ref_=tt_urv
