21 January 2018,johnny-burgundy,7," This film was mishandled from an advertising standpoint.
","Acts of Violence (2018)
This is an action film about a woman kidnapped by human traffickers. Her fiance and his ex-military brothers set out to track her down and save her before it is too late. It stars Bruce Willis, Mike Epps, Cole Hauser, Shawn Ashmore, Sophia Bush and Melissa Bolona. It has received generally unfavorable reviews and hasn't done well at the box office. This film was mishandled from an advertising standpoint. Sure, Bruce Willis is a selling point, but unless he's the main star, he shouldn't be advertised as such. The film itself is pretty good. It's a common theme recently popularized by the Taken series. Someone has been kidnapped or killed and our hero/anti-heroes come to the rescue and/or seek revenge. Throw in a cop who's trying to do things through legal means, and you have a film. It can be executed well, i.e. the aforementioned Taken. It can also be managed poorly, there are too many of these to list. This film falls in the middle.",/review/rw4031649/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2018,djtranny,6," Enjoyable B grade action/thriller
","Wow after reading some of the bad reviews, I almost didn't watch it. I love the way people go out of the way to watch a movie that they know is a B grade action movie and then come on imdb and write a review that discredits everything you SHOULD expect in a B grade action movie. So let me write a list of things that you should expect in a B grade action movie and check those off first: Amateur script- check, Amateur story - check, Amateur acting - check, but above expected, Amateur camera work - check, but again better than usual, Plot Holes - Check.
I like B grade action movies and when compared to the rest (and I've seen a LOT), I'd give this a solid 6.5 as it kept me interested and entertained for the majority of the 86 minute run-time and that's all that really needs to be said.",/review/rw4031649/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2018,MadRotaryOne_DDCgod,7," For anybody who decided to only read all the bad reviews....
","I never review movies here. All I want to say about this movie is that I was suspicious of this movie from the start. I was almost certain I was going to be turning this off after 5 or 10 minutes. But an hour in and I'm still watching it. I actually paused it to look something up about the movie, and happen to catch some of the reviews.",/review/rw4031649/?ref_=tt_urv

","In the bonus track on the DVD of ""Acts of Violence,"" the film artists described their three goals as (1) exploring the theme of ""family""; (2) the importance of raising awareness of PTSD in our returning vets; and (3) the horrific phenomenon of human trafficking with an especially high incidence in the United States in Ohio.",/review/rw4031649/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," Nothing new but still ok
","This is one of those movies you watch when there's nothing else to see. It's been (over)done many times before. The acting was better than expected, even for Bruce Willis who's been questionable in his past roles. The directing was the major issue here. This film lacked direction to the actors - it felt as if they were on their own in some scenes and in others the dialogue and action could have been better portrayed. Part of that was also the camera operator direction, again the directors job. The writing also had some plot issues and the editing could have been tighter. Never mind the lousy score throughout the film. 6.5/10 rounded up to a 7 for B-list actors doing a better than expected job.",/review/rw4031649/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2018,steveo122,6," 'What was the point?'
","An '80s drive-in style shoot-em-up revenge formula that once would have been a vehicle for Charles Bronson and Jan-Michael Vincent in their later days.
Was not expecting to get through it, but better production quality than I expected and decent 'better than the script deserved' acting made it an almost painless diversion, although the script/logic is too drive-in shallow to allow the attempted emotional triggers to fire and, thus, recreates one of life's difficult/interesting questions:
'What was the point?'",/review/rw4031649/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2018,brechtjustin,5," If this was a mini series, it would have been great.
","The first five minuites of this movie was great. The bond of the brothers protecting each other as children was great, and the VA scene was absolutely perfect. I have had the same experience with the VA. Unfortunately, after that, the story became fragmented. Honestly, it was a good story but the editing board must have had a hay day. It just jumped from scene to scene without many things being accounted for. The actors were not allowed to show their full range of emotions. If it was an 8 part mini series, it would have been great. The characters needed time to be explored more. If it had been longer, the action scenes could have been more developed. I like all the actors, and they probably did more in scenes that were left on the cutting room floor.",/review/rw4031649/?ref_=tt_urv

",I thought the movie was pretty good. It was not the best movie but it was a decent movie with a storyline. It had some familiar faces and names. The storyline was good. The movie was not slow or confusing either.,/review/rw4031649/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2020,packmanproductions,5," Second Amendment Shoot-Em-Up
","Three brothers take on human traffickers after the youngest has his wife snatched after a night out with her girlfriends. The acting was passable; the script could have been made up as they went with just some ad-lib tough guy talk. There were some plot holes as expected with a B-grade action flick but nothing that a few shootouts couldn't overcome. Lots of angry people in this one but living in Cleveland might do that to a person.
I've seen enough of Bruce Willis' latest movies to know that he'll basically make a cameo appearance so he doesn't need to be on set for more than a day or two. He gets his check and they can use his face to attract an audience. This followed the same scenario but at least he does get to shoot a few bad guys in this one. He had one facial expression the whole time...annoyance.
I didn't go into it expecting much so I wasn't disappointed. A quick time-waster that won't strain your brain.",/review/rw4031649/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2018,Leofwine_draca,5," Not bad for what it is
","Despite being generally panned by viewers and reviewers alike, ACTS OF VIOLENCE isn't too bad as a B-movie thriller. It was obviously shot in a hurry and the advertising of Bruce Willis is a bit of a cheat, given that he only plays a supporting character who turns out to be completely extraneous to the main story. Instead this is a Steven Seagal-style production about a trio of characters who go gunning for some people smugglers when one of their sisters is kidnapped. Cole Hauser, Shaun Ashmore and Ashton Holmes play the protagonists here and the first two are solid enough in their roles at least. There's some brief but brisk action scenes and some nasty bad guys. To be honest, given the film's rushed production I expected it to be far worse than it actually is; in fact, it's quite watchable if not brilliant.",/review/rw4031649/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2018,submitme,5," It's a-ohkay.
","This movie isn't particularly good, but it's okay for a single watch. But the movie is fairly fast paced, it's basically only an hour and 20 minutes.
Sure, the plot has holes and the logic is really quite silly at certain points during the movie. Had those not been there, I would have rated it 6, no problem. But there were action, and it was fast paced, so atleast not to get boring. The plot itself was very predictable, but I never expected much else. The quality of the cinematography and the action however... not all that great, but for me it worked alright, atleast enough for me to watch the whole movie.
For me, the movie were actually decent enough, for the most part. It was mainly towards the ending that I had the hardest time with it. The acting felt solid enough, but the druglord, played by Epps were clearly the worst to me. The 3 brothers Hause, Ashmore and Holmes did a decent job, so did Willis, when he were on screen, which he barely were. Also ""hecnhman"" no. 1, played by Brosnan also did a good job.",/review/rw4031649/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2018,meagainstthemovies,5," It Is What It Is
","So, this obviously isn't the best movie out there, but it's defiantly not that bad. Some of these reviews are ripping this film apart, but for it only being filmed in 15 days on a low budget, it is what it is. The action is pretty entertaining, the acting is believable, the editing is sub-part, unfortunately the script is the weakest part. It's a little simple, cheesy and overdone. I would watch if you are bored, want something simple, and are a sophia bush/bruce willis fan.",/review/rw4031649/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2019,FeastMode,5," my notes
","Decent straight-to-dvd-type movie. to my surprise i really cared about most of the characters, and there were some emotionally powerful moments. had a Four Brothers feel to it. some decent action and suspense. it also had a lot of dumbness (like a silencer that makes both silencer noise and regular gunshot noise rofl). overall this was somewhat enjoyable. remarkably better than some of the other straight-to-dvd trash that bruce willis has shown up in recently (1 viewing)",/review/rw4031649/?ref_=tt_urv

","Annoying cheesy two dimensional characters. Very, and I mean very predictable story line. Politically correct agenda. What's not to love? This one I couldn't even finish.

29 April 2018,zardoz-13,7," Above-Average, B-Movie About Human Trafficking with Bruce Willis
","""Acts of Violence"" is another B-movie melodrama that confines Bruce Willis to the sidelines for most of its 87-minutes. Actors Cole Hauser, Mike Epps, Shawn Ashmore, Ashton Holmes, and several other supporting players perform the heavy lifting in this gritty saga about human trafficking and the consequences of reprisal. After a brief gunfight between Cleveland Police and criminals, Detective James Avery (Bruce Willis of ""Die Hard"") confronts a suspect who refuses to surrender. They tangle atop a tall building, and the irate suspect slips over the edge. Avery watches his goon as he pleads for aid and then plunges to his death. Not a bad way to start a movie. Afterward, Avery disappears until midpoint, and later shows up briefly for a violent final scene with the ruthless kingpin crook. Unfortunately, things drag on sluggishly afterward for the first half-hour or so once the story shifts away from Avery to the trouble-prone MacGregor brothers. Once ""Salvation"" helmer Brett Donowho and ""SEAL Patrol"" scenarist Nicolas Aaron Mezzanatto have their heroes up to their collective necks in their predicament some 45 minutes later, and this R-rated epic compensates for those first thirty minutes and lives up to its title.

16 October 2020,classicsoncall,6," ""We go to war.""
","The tag line for this film on Netflix states that three brothers join forces with a world weary cop to save an abducted sister of theirs. The world weary cop is portrayed by Bruce Willis, who this time around looks like he might be a world weary actor as well. I don't want to disparage Willis because I like the guy, but his name in the credits is more intended as a draw; he just doesn't have a whole lot to do here except look the other way as Cole Hauser (Deklan), Shawn Ashmore (Brandon) and Ashton Holmes (Roman) take up arms to rescue Roman's fiancee (Melissa Bolona) from a drug and human trafficking ring led by Max Livington (Mike Epps). It's a fairly by the numbers picture with an odd scene in which the drug kingpin forces Mia (Bolona) to shoot one of his underlings for botching his standing orders to only abduct girls on skid row. With the standard amount of shootouts and assorted gunplay, the good guy brothers prevail but with losses on their side as well. This is a take it or leave it picture, and if you're tuning in as a Bruce Willis fan you might be disappointed. As a time filler, it fits the bill.",/review/rw4031649/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2018,twelve-house-books,1," Important Content
","As an official advisor for an international anti-trafficking team, I believe that the content of this film is too important to miss. The acting may be sub-par as well as the plot line and dialogue and predictable scenes, but the fact that this kind of thing happens all around us should be known and understood by everyone. And after all that, it's always rewarding to see reprobates punished for their acts of violence.",/review/rw4031649/?ref_=tt_urv
