9 August 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,6," The Meg was meh
","16 reviews, and half are all a fake high-rated single review of this film - makes me shake my head why the producers think their viewers are dumb and wont see thru the fakes. All it takes is one click to see the only single review from the poster. Don't get me started on the moronic review from halil-92019: ""Playing computer games makes kids smarter?""",/review/rw4281254/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2018,TheLittleSongbird,4," Mega mediocrity
","My main reasons for seeing 'The Meg' were that there are classic shark films out there (there is an obvious example that won't be named by means of fairness in the review but has been mentioned elsewhere) and that it was part of my many quests to see as many 2018 films as possible. It did look from the cover that it would be some kind of guilty pleasure fun, which was my ideal kind of film for the day.",/review/rw4281254/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2020,Ruskington,1," I hate this
","I hate this film. Like really hate it. Firstly, I hate Jason Statham, with his husky breathy voice and boringly perfect physique. I hate the trope dot com billionaire, for oh so many reasons. I hate the Asian woman with her perfect hair and make-up and criminally neglectful parenting. I hate her child, as much as this film wants me to love her cutesiness. I hate the token black guy who, obviously, is loud and dramatic at all times. I hate Statham's ex-wife, because of course she looks like that. I hate the Asian woman's dad with his soppy monologues and general pointlessness. And I particularly hate the punky goth woman or whatever the hell she is with her stupid Gen X hairdo, starter pack tattoos and unnecessary Botox.",/review/rw4281254/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2018,ripleyspussy,," Honest Thoughts On The Film By Jason Statham And Director Jon Turteltaub
","Although I've just watched this film, this is not a review in the traditional sense. I just wanted to make this clear, because I don't mean to mislead anybody. Rather than giving you my own two cents (well, I WILL give you those, but later), I would like to let the people directly involved in The Meg share their - refreshingly honest - thoughts on it, because they had some very interesting things to say that helped me better understand what I'd just seen. Let's start with Jason Statham's recent interview with Frosty Weintraub. You'll notice Jason tries to be diplomatic, but he has a very hard time concealing the fact that he's not too happy with the finished product:",/review/rw4281254/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2018,AverageJoesDriveInPodcast,7," A fun theater-going experience!
","I will be upfront with anyone who hasn't watched this yet. Mindset-wise if you go in thinking more along the lines of Deep Blue Sea rather than JAWS you'll probably have a good time. If you want serious, deep storylines and Oscar-caliber performances you probably should avoid it because this isn't it. Also on that note, why the hell would you go see this movie in the first place if you want that?",/review/rw4281254/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2018,austin-65005,5," It's everything you would guess
","Look, this movie wasn't bad... but it wasn't great either... Everything that comes with a shark movie was here. A cheesy storyline that bounced around a lot, and some great action sequences wth the shark. Jason Statham was the same as he usually is, stone faced and serious. Rainn Wilson did a great job with his part. But other than that, nothing really sticks out.",/review/rw4281254/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2018,moviexclusive,7," Jason Statham versus a 75-foot prehistoric shark - it's as simple, as cheesy, but as enjoyable as that
","The Meg' is basically short for 'Jason Statham versus a 75-foot prehistoric shark', and if that doesn't sound like your idea of an exciting late-summer movie, then this slab of B-movie cheese is clearly not for you. Oh yes, the science-fiction horror novel by Steve Alten on which this movie is based was precisely meant to be that sort of pulpy entertainment, and director Jon Turteltaub ensures that his adaptation is balanced squarely between self-awareness and self-seriousness, even though it does start off being more of the latter before tipping into more of the former.",/review/rw4281254/?ref_=tt_urv

13 August 2018,mhorg2018,1," Stupid enough to be on the SyFy Channel
","How did this not end up on the SyFy Channel? This is one hackneyed, stupid movie. Basically while exploring the Marianas Trench, a gigantic shark, the Megaldon or some such is released. Previously to this a deep rescue submersible encounters it and the main guy, Jason Stratham is ignored. He gets called back to rescue others which is when this stupid movie really gets rolling. The effects are so-so changing from scene to scene. The best thing is when the little Yorkie who goes for a swim survives. This movie is a great video for how not to remain safe on any type of boat. No one wears a life vest, or any other survival gear. The story is barely above the worthless garbage shown on the SyFy channel. This is really just one stupid movie. I'm sure it'll show up on tv in a matter of months, if not weeks.",/review/rw4281254/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2018,dpb0402,3," Worst Dialogue Ever.
","Honestly this film has not only the worst dialogue of any movie this summer/year. It is the worst dialogue I have ever heard in a bad movie ever. Deep Blue Sea, The Shallows, and Jaws 3 all had better dialogue than this cliche title.",/review/rw4281254/?ref_=tt_urv

16 December 2018,Leofwine_draca,6," Moderately entertaining
","THE MEG is the latest movie in Hollywood's obsession with killer shark movies; this ranks beneath the likes of JAWS and even DEEP BLUE SEA, although it's moderately entertaining as a one-off watch. If you're looking for quality in the genre these days then I'd recommend going for the lower-budgeted likes of THE REEF or BAIT. THE MEG follows the fortunes of the crew of a scientific base in the middle of the ocean when they accidentally reawaken a megalodon from its prehistoric slumber; this massive shark proceeds to dominate and eat all and sundry. This is a co-production between Hollywood and China, so expect Chinese supporting actors and more than a little propaganda. Jason Statham does his action man routine with ease and is given able support from an up-for-it cast, while the action scenes are certainly larger-than-life, although with all the CGI they're hardly realistic. An undercurrent of humour makes some of the more ludicrous scenes easier to swallow. It's hardly great, but it does the job as a piece of switch-off-the-brain viewing.",/review/rw4281254/?ref_=tt_urv

27 August 2018,nogodnomasters,7," That living fossil ate my friend!
","Jason Statham vs a Megalodon is not a fair fight. They should have given Jason an artificial limb like Dwayne Johnson in ""Skyscraper"" to make the battle more even. A thermal layer keeps the megalodon at a depth lower than 11,000 feet. A private company violates that layer and releases Megalodon. ",/review/rw4281254/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2019,BA_Harrison,5," Not quite a megalodon't, but not the mega success I had hoped for.
","I first saw Jaws in 1975 at the tender age of seven; it scared the hell out of me then, and is an exhilarating ride to this day. The Meg, on the other hand, is a formulaic, big-budget B-movie that fails to get the pulse pounding, despite it's prehistoric shark being three times as big as Bruce, Spielberg's iconic great white.",/review/rw4281254/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2018,Silberfalke,8," That happens when studios interfere to much
","As someone who really loves the first ""MEG"" novels I could not wait to see the movie. It was clear to me, that it will be different, and that from the moment on the trailer hit the screens. And I was okay with it and lowered my expectations. ",/review/rw4281254/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2018,jjdausey,1," The most insultingly bad movie I've seen in ages
","From the complete artificiality of the environments and effects to the horrible acting (put Statham back in the pub he came from) to the broken language performances from the Asian cast members, this was a ratchet p.o.s. And shame on warner brothers for their false advertisements around LA, pretending this was in any way a movie about a shark attacking Americans. This was like a bad Sci-Fi Channel movie funded by the Chinese government.",/review/rw4281254/?ref_=tt_urv

13 August 2018,Jared_Andrews,5," Mostly a Mega-Disappointment
","There's a scene during The Meg when I expected a character to say, ""you're gonna need a bigger boat."" Sadly, no one does. So, in a story that's so clearly reminiscent of Jaws, an opportunity for a moment of self-aware fun is wasted. It's emblematic of the entire movie - all the pieces are in place for something entertaining to occur, but the payoff never comes. ",/review/rw4281254/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2018,ricemuscle,5," Disappointed
","I want to start this I saying I love the book series, well at least the first few. I read all five books that were out at the time in 5 days total. I was so excited for this movie. When I saw Jason Statham was cast as Jonas Taylor I was immediately bummed out. I like Jason Statham but we all know the type of movies he's in and I was really hoping that they would go more the route of Jaws and not the route of Piranha 3D. Make a really good film with great actors that just happened to have a shark. Then I saw the trailer and was even more disappointed. The tone of the movie was all Goofy. Even with all that I still was very excited and I dropped my expectations and just went into it expecting a type of action Blockbuster sequel quality movie. I have not been this disappointed in a long time. I'm not one of those people that's going to give a movie a one or a two when clearly a movie of this caliber is not that bad and that should be reserved for straight to Syfy 1 million dollar budget crapfests. Dont.listen to people who give it a one. Thats just false. However holy crap was this a huge let down. The CGI was actually pretty good in some parts and then other parts it wasn't at all. The film started off pretty good and there were quite a few changes in the characters in the story from the book which is expected. But once the shark got to the service it just went downhill. Statham actually wasn't that bad although I maintain my position that he was not the right guy for Jonas Taylor. Li Bingbing was absolutely atrocious. I haven't seen her in any other movies so it could have just been The eay it was written but her dialogue was horrible and it just seemed like she was acting which a movie shouldn't be like that. I love Rainn Wilson but again I didn't enjoy him in this movie. I thought the little girl was completely useless and I don't know why that character was even added. The actress was fine but the character itself was just ridiculous. Page had a couple parts where he was really good but his scenes were just silly. I really wanted to like this movie but the comedy just too much. I'm a firm believer and I've said this before and I'll say it every time that death should not be funny in movies like this. It's okay to have comedy in these movies if you have to but if someone is in a scenario where they're going to die or potentially going to die don't make it funny. My biggest issue with the movie is the fact that they were constantly in life or death situations and never seemed scared. There's a 70 foot shark that just flipped your boat over and you're on the turned over Hull and you're making jokes and you don't seem like you're in trouble at all. Without giving away spoilers there's somewhat of a Chase and they just act like it's no big deal. Even if you were going to go the route of over-the-top ridiculous action movie there's absolutely zero reason why the characters shouldn't be absolutely terrified. I wasn't a big fan of the end and although there were some funny parts and there where some really cool scenes I just in no way thought this movie was good. It doesn't take a lot to please me normally. I love dumbed down movies from time to time but this was just stupid and in no way believable and I just can't express how disappointed I am. I would really really really really was looking forward to this and even set my expectations lower than I wanted them to be and still came out shaking my head. I honestly think I shook my head through the entire movie and threw my hands in the air as if to say what the hell. I'm not going to tell people not to see it because I love the books and I love the author and I want to see the movie do well anyway. Maybe a sequel will be better but doubtful

11 April 2019,MLDinTN,6," fun flick
","You have a hot lead (Statham) , a giant shark, bad acting, a villain that gets what he deserves, one liners, and a decent plot. What else do you need for a fun flick. While this was no master piece, it was still fun to watch. The shark effects were pretty good, not awful like the movies on the sci fi channel. And how can you not love a scene in which someone jumps in the water with a 100 ft shark looking to hit it with a tracker, or inject poison. The final death scene of the meg was cool too. But the smaller sharks were worse CGI effects.",/review/rw4281254/?ref_=tt_urv
