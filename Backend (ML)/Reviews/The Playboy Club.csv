","If you're looking for a fun, enjoyable stoner comedy, this is a great show, three best friends living together and just getting up to random shenanigans, supported with a great cast of actors, 7 great seasons and could have easily continued.",/review/rw3421134/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2015,deloudelouvain,9," Great humor!
","When I read some reviews on here from people that don't like this show or that don't think it is funny at all I'm already sure that I wouldn't get along with those narrow-minded folks. That kind of stuck up people are the people to avoid when you go out and want to have a bit of fun. This show is just really funny and all the characters play their role brilliantly. Adam, Blake and Anders, three friends living and working together, trying to avoid work as much as possible and partying as much as possible. The jokes are all about drugs, sex, parties etc. Or all the good stuff in other words. If I was young again I certainly would hangout with them. Brilliant show!",/review/rw3421134/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2020,xMartyMcFlyx,9," This show is hilarious
","I don't write many reviews on IMDb but I thought I'd give my 2 cents on Workaholics. I'd always known about this show and seen commercials for it on Comedy Central but I never actually sat down and watched it. That was until several years ago while flying across country and having nothing to do on the airplane... they had basic cable for everyone with little televisions in front of each passengers seat, so needless to say the only thing to do to kill time was find something on cable. I switched to Comedy Central and noticed that Workaholics was playing a marathon of episodes so I decided to give it a shot. I was hooked within the first couple episodes! I'll admit the humor is kind of juvenile but it's also pretty clever and very, very funny. I love the countless references they make. The show is about 3 telemarketers (Anders, Blake and Adam) who all live and work together in California. They are stoners, slackers, alcoholics and most importantly very funny! If you haven't seen this show yet it is currently streaming all seasons on Hulu right now (March 30th, 2020) so get on there and binge watch while you still can! Highly recommended. I don't watch many tv shows or sitcoms so for me to be such a huge fan definitely says a lot. Two thumbs way up!!",/review/rw3421134/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2011,ricky-33-806893,10," My new favorite show
","Seriously the best TV show in a very long time. The whole office thing isn't very original but this show is still fresh and hilarious every episode. I made an IMDb account just to write this review and to mark that other dudes review as unhelpful! I can't wait to watch the rest of these episodes, I have literally watched the first episode four times and I just watched the third one and it blew my mind. Just talking about this show makes me laugh. If somebody told me that this show was a copy of the office I would say that they were probably on shrooms when they watched it because it is ten times better than office! Not that there is anything wrong with the office. The office is probably my fifth favorite show, but Workaholics is by far my number one!",/review/rw3421134/?ref_=tt_urv

5 May 2014,jellyneckr,," Best comedy on cable
","""Workaholics"" is a show that really shouldn't work as well as it does. The show is extremely juvenile, stupid, vulgar, and occasionally very unrealistic. Under normal circumstances, these would be criticisms. However, thanks to the three main stars of the series, these qualities make the series oddly endearing. Anders Holm, Adam DeVine, and Blake Anderson are probably not going to be given Emmy Awards for their performances any time in the near future, but what they do on a weekly basis is often funnier and more off-the-wall than anything else on television. There have been several shows about twenty-something guys just hanging out, a fact that ""Workaholics"" is well aware of and satirizes from time to time. What separates ""Workaholics"" from all those other ""bro"" type shows is that ""Workaholics"" isn't afraid to go to extremely dumb places. In fact, during its best episodes, ""Workaholics"" is the definition of inspired stupidity. The writers throw so many jokes and references in each 21-minute episode that even if one episode isn't very good, there's always still a number of solid laughs. Miraculously, no matter how dumb the characters may act, the main trio almost always remains likable even if the characters are presented as a bit too naive or stupid at times. Over the past four seasons, ""Workaholics"" has remained consistently hilarious, something that can't be said for most comedies on television. The show may start to suffer some problems once the characters get older, though for right now the series remains perfectly entertaining for what it is. 8/10",/review/rw3421134/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2020,sjhollen,9," One of my favorite shows
","I love this show so much. You have to be into this type of comedy, if you're not you won't like it cause the humor is the same in every episode. Adam DeVine is the only stand up comedian so he is the only one I heard of when I first watched this but Blake Anderson And anders Holm are even funnier than he is. They all 3 have great chemistry. Some of the side characters are funny too, Montez is pretty funny. But if you're not easily offended and like party-style bro type of comedy you'll love this show",/review/rw3421134/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2011,shinsan1,10," Suuuuuuper Funny.
","Irreverent to everything, including itself, this show takes a light look at the harsh reality for most 20somethings. (like when they're wondering how they're going to get clean urine when everyone their age smokes pot. Word, right?) It's refreshing, constantly funny and well-acted. With three slackers as the main characters, it's nice to see each one slack in their own style, be it uptight, mellow or on the edge. (ders, blake and adam). I'd have to agree with other reviewers that I hope Adam tones down the funny-cuz-im-loud aspect. He does it well, and it's usually funny, but it won't be quickly. I get the fratboy lifestyle mocking though.",/review/rw3421134/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2011,Togmo,9," Definitely worth a watch if you like half hour comedy shows.
","Like most new comedies it took me an episode or two to really get into this although I did like it enough from the first episode to watch more. Like most half hour comedies as the characters develop it gets better and better but where so many new comedies seem to fall down this one doesn't. The show doesn't focus too much on character development which allows the jokes to flow freely and fools you in to developing an interest in the characters, like a good comedy should. I probably enjoy it a little more than some might because Anders, that is Ders with a 'Hard-An' reminds me of a friend of mine at work.",/review/rw3421134/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2011,westcoastloc,10," The best
","At first I wasn't paying attention to this show and thought it wasn't funny. Boy was I wrong. I like simple effective concepts for shows. You take 3 goofballs who like to make bad puns, pump themselves up, and not take life very seriously and you've got a great show. Jillian is hilarious how tough she is and how shes like one of the guys. The 90s references are spot on from hip hop catch phrases, old rap lines, video games, tmnt they are spot on. I hope this show is on the air for many years. There's been a ton of times where I did exactly what they did on the show, ie when they were arguing over who would be which ninja turtle (everyone wants to be leonardo or mike and no one wants donatello) the outbursts adam has are also really funny. This is a very strong comedy if you can appreciate drug humor, bad puns, and being juvenile. Its a super relateable show if you are a goofball.",/review/rw3421134/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2011,kedarguru,10," No Doubt One of the Funniest Shows I Have Ever Seen.
","I'd say, judging by the user rating, that this is one of those ""you-get-it-or-you-don't"" shows. I personally don't see how this would be not funny. This is definitely fresh material. Here you have the lives of three just-out-of-college roommates, working together in a call center, having parties, pulling pranks, taking drugs. Livin' the dream.",/review/rw3421134/?ref_=tt_urv

3 June 2011,jwtrox08706,9," A total riot
","What can I say about Workaholics? I mean you have to watch it, really. I've been watching Comedy Central for South Park for the past few years, and very recently I caught an episode of this show after South Park. The episode of South Park before Workaholics had me already warmed up for some funny stuff, and then the first episode of Workaholics I saw just went in for the kill. It was hilarious, and it had me hooked. It's unorthodox. It's absurd, and it's silly. However, those are all done in a way that they are the most redeeming and endearing qualities of the show. It's just three working class stoners who are just starting to get into the workforce and start their adult lives, and all the twists, turns and misadventures they come across just living life. If you liked Office Space or almost any and/or every stoner comedy film or television show ever made, then watch this show. It will make you $h!t your pants from laughing. 9/10",/review/rw3421134/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is the show I watch whenever I'm feeling crappy, sick, heartache, whatever. Even when I'm feeling awful it always makes me laugh out loud. The characters, stories, punchlines, filmography (yes it's got great filmography), all of it really makes me feel like life is just a joke and everything is meant to be enjoyed and nothing should be taken too seriously.",/review/rw3421134/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2011,tompreston07,9," Really Funny
","This show is hilarious. The Office, Entourage and 30 Rock have all jumped the shark, and I thought Sunny was getting close until last season, which was stronger than the previous. A few years ago, I found television to be ripe with great comedies, but just recently I was noticing that Curb and Sunny were about the only two that I found hilarious on a consistent basis. But Workaholics surprised me, it really seemed to come out of nowhere. And I'm so glad to hear that they are already writing for season 2. Awesome news.",/review/rw3421134/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2013,gbuff8,10," So Good It Hurts
","Funny, Irreverent, and doesn't take itself too seriously. Workaholics is the type of show that you need to watch multiple times to get all of the jokes. It is sneaky smart, in that it seems dumb as hell at first, but the more you watch it the more you understand how smart these guys are. The later episodes haven't been as good as they have gotten further away from the office drop-back, however the writing remains sharp and it's obvious the guys don't give a f*ck, which makes it hard to critique them too harshly. Overall, it is a relaxing piece of humor that is easy to share a beer and a laugh with over and over. Thankk gawd CC picked up a 4th and 5th season.",/review/rw3421134/?ref_=tt_urv

","These are good times we're living in when a show like 'Workaholics' has lasted five seasons, with a promise of more to come in the future. Since the show debuted in 2011, we have come to love the three comedians of Adam DeVine, Anders Holm, and Blake Anderson and their unique style in making us laugh each week. Episode after episode, we've seen them get into some pretty sticky situations.",/review/rw3421134/?ref_=tt_urv

21 April 2011,dinotheman,7," Thanks Comedy Central
","I have to applaud Comedy Central, not because this show is particularly great but rather because they put shows like this on the air. It's not as funny as Man Bites Dog, Halfway House, Issues, etc but it is still funny and worth watching. By Comedy Central putting on shows like this, funny people out there actually have an obtainable goal if they want to have a go at getting a show made. Had BBC3 not aired The Office perhaps Ricky Gervais would be a plumber instead of a comedian. I guess my point is that this show isn't paint by the numbers, slick camera shots and laugh tracks. It's one of those shows that takes elements of guys you know and amps them up. Not quite to pro wrestling levels but probably a bit higher than you'd see in real life. It's fun though and you won't walk away feeling as if someone just insulted your intelligence. You never know, one of these young guys could end up being the next big funny man. Lay off the network shows for a week and check this show out.",/review/rw3421134/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2016,noxwaste,8," Hilarious TV show if you're into juvenile humor
","I've always loved juvenile humor. I can't help it, it's the sense of humor I was born with. But Workaholics has some of the absolute funniest scenes in TV today. In a world overpopulated with lawyer and cop dramas, Workaholics helps to break the mold and bring fresh air into the comedy television series world. The three characters all play so well together it's as if they were all real-life brothers. Unfortunately I haven't seen them in anything other than Workaholics, and it would be a shame if their careers didn't skyrocket into the big screen, but if you're looking for a hilarious sit-down comedy to watch this is it. Just don't let your kids watch, as it can be quite raunchy at times.",/review/rw3421134/?ref_=tt_urv
