22 July 2016,KathleenK22,9," All six seasons watched and enjoyed
",Just watched the very last episode in the final season and the series gathered momentum from the beginning to the end. I got very attached to the characters and will miss them which showed that the characters were well developed. The stories were good as well. Sexual tension between the pairs was irritating along the way but in the end that was satisfying. The stand out acting came from Jake and Des although the whole cast was very good and convincing in their roles. Des provided much of the humour. The island setting was beautiful and colourful. The very last episode and even the few before that were riveting and the series ended on a very good note.,/review/rw6946142/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2013,BlackJack_B,8," An absolute joy to watch!
","I've never visited the province of Newfoundland and Labrador but I consider the entire population to be my friends. I've always been intrigued by the populace due to their unique accent/dialect, their music, their food such as fish and brewis and their booze. I've watched a lot of NTV and have learned a great deal about their province. These are hardy, tough and determined people living on a rock where Canada's worst weather occurs. They love to fight. The idea of an action comedy-drama show set there is a brilliant idea.",/review/rw6946142/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2011,andrew.r.w,8," Thumbs up! This show is growing on me.
","If you had said last season that this show was a little cheesy, I would have agreed. I mean, Jake is right out of the 70's in so many ways. He hasn't really grown up but the show has grown up around him this season in my opinion. The characters are deeper, the plots more complex and interesting, and a lot of the lame situations have been benched in favour of better material. ",/review/rw6946142/?ref_=tt_urv

16 April 2016,gregorybmowery,8," A Terrific PI Series with a Charismatic Lead
","Canadian actor, Allan Hawco, is a likable PI in this series that ran for six years and can now be seen on Netflix. In partnership with his father, Jake (Hawco) and Malachy Doyle (Sean McGinley) investigate murder, robbery, and other crimes in picturesque St. Johns, Newfoundland. The hour-long show has plenty of action, and lots of humor, a la The Rockford Files with Hawco a younger and studlier version of James Garner. This guy is catnip to women, and skirts the edge of the law to beat the bad guys at their own game. Lots of action, involving the Doyle clan, who are the ultimate crime-solving family. One character, however, consistently strikes a false note and that is Des, a kid who has become part of the family. He's a consistent idiot as a character, highly unfunny simply in the way. Otherwise, this show makes for wonderful binge watching.",/review/rw6946142/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2018,farrarsteven,9," A Hidden Gem
","I found this lovely gem of a show on Netflix and I must a it's truly excellent! With such a well-balanced, vibrant and stellar cast, I can't figure out why I didn't come across this show sooner. ",/review/rw6946142/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2021,foxfirehounds,6," Entertaining
","Plus, beautiful scenery. Don't mistake this for quality drama, comedy or deep plots. Most of the leads are solid and likable folks. Stories range from incredulous to completely absurd. The local police, especially the females are incompetent drama queens. The character of Leslie Bennet is the worst. She is a one dimensional dimbulb whose partner is a needlessly gruff jerk who has a healthy dislike for the star of the show. Probably because they would NEVER close a case w/o Jake and Malachy's help! Still, a humorous bit of benign entertainment ain't the worst thing in the world, I guess.",/review/rw6946142/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2011,lyndaawilliams,10," Excellent Show
","Well, I do not know about other viewers,especially from the United States, but I am not from Newfoundland and I love this show. Even though I am a Tom Selleck fan (Magnum P.I), this is the Canadian show to watch. ",/review/rw6946142/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2012,mm-39,6," Not bad for C B C
","Not bad for C B C! The show is better than the usual educational T V we do not watch on C B C such as The Nature of Things. However,the show is campy, in a low budget horror movie way! A few good laughs and neat stunts, and a few misses on humour and action. The show could grow on me. It kind of remind me of Corner gas meets a P I movie. I would not go out of my way to watch the ""Republic of Doyle"", but I would not shut the show off either. I give the ""Republic of Doyle"" a six out of ten. The show is a east cost version of the old C B C show Tom Stone. I bet the show will get better with time as the actors and writers create stronger character development! It is nice to have something other than sports to watch on the C B C.",/review/rw6946142/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2020,Calicodreamin,9," Great action and good laughs
","The characters are what drive this tv show to near perfection, they are all well cast and well acted. The main characters have great chemistry that makes the banter and humor feel effortless. I love Dez so much! Like most shows, some good story arcs some not so good. At times the storyline gets a bit muddled bringing in bigger agencies and conspiracies. But the average one off episodes have well developed storylines. A great show!",/review/rw6946142/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2017,spokanegolfer,10," Trip to St John Newfoundland in my future!!
","I just finished binge watching Republic of Doyle! All in all, I found the series to be very refreshing! More than anything, I loved the shows strong family values as well as doing the right thing when the world is against you! Strong morals throughout! There are a number of attractive leading ladies throughout the series. Most of them are interested in getting closer with Jake. However, Jake only has eyes for Leslie. For some reason, it takes all 6 seasons for Jake and Leslie to be a family! The main issue I had with the show is the police force has problems with Jake and Doyle & Doyle PI investigations! They regularly serve up solved cases to the police on a silver platter, yet no gratitude to be seen. Various officers are promoted thanks to the Doyles, yet the police consider them enemies! My one gripe is the joke of firearms. Jake doesn't like and doesn't believe in firearms. He doesn't use them and I don't recall him firing one shot throughout the show. As soon as he takes a gun away from a criminal, he empties it immediately. If you watch closely, the firearms rarely have any rounds in them. Safeties are keep on and single action only firearms (1911) aren't often cocked and ready! More than anything, I love the accepting attitude of the Canadians, and willingness to give people second chances! The non-judging values are very healthy and help others to even see the good in themselves!! Did someone say Season 7??",/review/rw6946142/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2017,cdtharpe,7," Love it!
","Just stumbled upon this gem while scrolling through Netflix. Looking for something kinda like Psych...though this is not nearly as good as Psych, it has its own charm and appeal. The women in the show are adorable too, which never hurts. I'm on season 2 and the acting and stories are getting better. I say, give it a few episodes, get to know the characters, and you'll grow to really enjoy it! Peace, Dwayne",/review/rw6946142/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2012,roomstudio,8," Good and it gets better
","At first I was a little skeptical about this series, and certainly the concept is a pretty well-worn one. It has improved with time though as the characters established their roles and the balance between the comic and the serious has settled into something a bit less predictable than it was at the start. Some nice guest roles have helped out as well (Gordon Pinsent, Russell Crowe). If nothing else the series is a wonderful advertisement for the fantastic world of Newfoundland: the houses, the vistas, and most definitely the crazy half-Irish/half-Canadian accents add to the appeal. All in all worth watching, though some might find it a slow burn at first.",/review/rw6946142/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2012,tiggers-3,10," Great Show!!
","Being from Newfoundland originally, I am a bit biased. It is definitely a east coast taste of Starsky and Hutch or Magnum PI. I do love seeing backdrops of home and hearing words from my youth :) The actors do a great job portraying our culture and way of life. It is also great seeing other Newfoundland celebrities and friends of our wonderful province (Russell Crowe for example) on the episodes as guest stars. They all did a wonderful job on their respective episodes!",/review/rw6946142/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2018,lightheartedbeing,9," heroes who hate guns, plus laughs
","I thoroughly enjoyed this show, and was surprised that I did. The main character, the city of St. John's, Newfoundland, (is a a republic?) was wonderful. The place, the language, the scenery, the homey feel, the small town everyone knowing everyone's business. Watched all 6 seasons, laughed out loud several times which I don't often do, so they pulled off the comedy part really well. Over the course of the sic seasons, the characters go through al ot, and the character arcs are really good. The plot lines of returning characters crescendos in the last two seasons, and speaks to lots of concerns about power grabbing behind the scenes machinations taking over governments, corruption everywhere. Our Republic of Doyle is governed by good ideals, heroes all, though the characters are flawed in many ways. How that plays out in relationships of all kinds is fascinating. There are heart wrenching twists, and soul crushing events a plenty, fights, great cars and car chases, and even though our heroes hate guns and hardly ever use them, there are gun fights, too. The show is both modern and a throw back, a little Magnum PI, some Castle in there as well. The show was fun entertainment, a visit to another land, and facing lots of issues as well. Well worth the watch.",/review/rw6946142/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2020,braquecubism,2," OK at 1st- nicest thing is the locale
","The thing I enjoy, is the charming locale. it's pretty cold up there. they don't seem to shoot in the below freeing cold.
1st , jake doyle. I hate to criticize ppl on looks. He is cute, except he has the smallest mouth with no lips. the longer I see him, the worse it got. The father, an Irish actor with Irish accent- his charm wears thin quickly. in reading, it is characteristic of this area in Canada because of the early settlers. but his son doesn't have the same accent. Nor do any of the other residents, including the female cop. and somewhere in the there the dead mother came from Ireland. so where is jake's irish accent. Des is such a dim witted character. fumbling, confused, and this is supposed to be charming and funny....not funny just sad. Des, the dim witted side kick- not stupid just dim witted, it's mildly entertaining with some charm. but the longer it's on, the more boring it gets. How is it on so long. but than again, BlueBloods and CSI & all it's spin offs is on over 10- 15years here
Also, for all the times Jake and others are hit in the head, knocked out, with no apparent harm. in reality, there would have to be at least a cumulative affect of permanent harm.
why 2 stars and not 1, it's not the worse show I've ever seen. Just dull and cliche. And could any police force operate like this. . I watched thu the series, skipping a lot- some episodes are better. allowing that this city is the most crime ridden, organized crime controlled imaginable. with street shoot outs, and corruption. Doesn't ""Newfoundland"" object. yes shooting there brings money,& shows a picturesque area (with very little commerce or places of interest) movies, restaurants, museums, historic places, must see squares. No fast food joints, commercial area, chain stores; Hotels or motels. In an area largely ignored by media. last Season #6- was the wildest- They give a 10 minute happy wrap up. all is well in Doyleland. as I said, I skipped a lot.",/review/rw6946142/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2020,delzog,6," The most annoying character...
","The character played by Mark O'Brien, ""Des Courtney"" ruins the show. Nobody, I mean nobody, would keep such a dullard around them and certainly not in such business as private investigation. It was okay when he was a punk who was into graffiti, but they adopt a grown up who has the character of a 6 year old. After over 3 years, his character hasn't grown and is only more annoying. At the end of the second season I actually cheered when he got shot and there was the likely possibility that he'd die. Aside from that annoying garbage, the rest of the show actually is quite good and would be worth a few more stars. But people like me will fast forward through anything that has him in it. Really-really ruins the show.",/review/rw6946142/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2018,taswavo999,10," Great series - loving it tbh
","Based only on 1.3 seasons I love this series.
They were, tbh, fools to hold this from the world unless they already saw an end for it - I've not seen it all but the end happening a year or so after opening up to USA networks can't a coincidence.",/review/rw6946142/?ref_=tt_urv
