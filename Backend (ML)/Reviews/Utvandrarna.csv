18 November 2003,kamwingp,9," Brutally Beautiful
","The storyline is predictable, but the visual and the fights makes up for it. I understand why people compare the lead actor with Jet Li. They both have that presence on screen, the amazing flexibility and fighting sequences. Outstanding acrobatic movements when running from the bad guys in the street and it was good to see the shots from different angles.",/review/rw3023964/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2004,Antagonisten,," Entertaining
","I saw Ong-Bak for the first time on the Stockholm Film Festival in November of 2003, and now recently saw it again on DVD. I usually see at least 4-5 Asian films on the festival every year and each one is a gamble. At worst Asian action films can be unbearably slow and dull with uninteresting action scenes and horrible acting. At their best they can be like a wonderful ballet with astonishing moves and moods. Ong-Bak falls somewhere inbetween these two.",/review/rw3023964/?ref_=tt_urv

20 April 2005,Chris Knipp,9," The pure pleasure of the real thing
","That ""Thai Warrior"" is Worowit/Panom Yeerum, AKA Tony Jaa, and he's the reason for watching this movie. He's an amazingly gifted young Muai Thai kick boxer and stunt man who did all his leaps and jumps and dives. My favorite moment of all is the one where he's chasing through the streets and dives under a car, slides out the other side, and pops up again all in one smooth motion. Do you think that's easy? It's barely even conceivable. And he does all this without digital manipulation or the wires we've gotten all too familiar with in Chinese martial arts movies. Look for the real thing here, no arty made-for-westerners romances à la ""Crouching Tiger"" or ""Flying Daggers."" This is like finding a dirty little restaurant in San Francisco's Tenderloin that has really authentic Vietnamese or Pakistani food. No frills -- just the joy of truly unmediated experience. The story, something about the head from Ting's (Jaa's) village temple's Buddha statue (or ONG-BAK) whose theft by a gangster's low level employee disgraces the village and must be restored, is a mere formality, just enough to get things going and give Ting a back story.",/review/rw3023964/?ref_=tt_urv

","Ong-Bak. A movie I had first heard about almost two years ago as a little blurb on the internet. A little less than a year ago, I began to read more and more about it and some new actor by the name of Tony Jaa. I finally began to see clips online of the film, and started to notice what people were raving about. While international DVDs had appeared in front of me left and right, I held out for the big day to see it on ""the big screen"" fresh and with few spoilers. And that day, was today. My expectations were already moderately high, reading that this new actor is the next Jackie Chan, and even Bruce Lee, and how he too uses no doubles... but he also uses no wires, which even Chan has used. Well, all I can say is that after sitting in the theaters for nearly two hours, my expectations were far surpassed.",/review/rw3023964/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie is just great. There are no words to explain how classicly the actions has been choreographed. Tony Ja is simply great and beyond comparison. Bruce, Jet and Jackie took a couple of movies to reach the top in my favorite list..But Tony Ja is at the top in one shot. Sure I would add this movie as No.1 in my top 5 list of action movies ever. The first chase in the streets is one spectacular proof of Tony's efforts. The thai free style kickboxing is simply superb.",/review/rw3023964/?ref_=tt_urv

","Ting lives in a village where they worship the statue of Ong-bak. When an unscrupulous young man comes to the village to buy valuable goods, he steals the head and returns to Bangkok where he gives it to his boss  a crime lord who presides over illegal pit fights and steals historical artefacts. Ting goes to Bangkok to join up with former villager Humlae (who now is a street hustler and calls himself George).

13 March 2005,stamper,8," Jackie Chan can quit with an easy heart, replacements have arrived
","Back in the early nineties, there seemed to be an abundance of good action vehicles and there were some powerful action stars. Names like Jean Claude van Damme and Steven Seagal (who threw punches) and Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger (who shot many guns) stood for some pretty good action films and good fight sequences. Since halfway the 1990's however, there was a tide of good action films and action fans like myself (I was 14 to 15 at the time) had to turn elsewhere. John Woo became my number one (after seeing Hard Target) and then I started watching more and more Jackie Chan. That guy is simply amazing and even over the last few years he has made some very good action films (First Strike, Shanghai Noon and Rush Hour).",/review/rw3023964/?ref_=tt_urv

","There's no denying Jaa's talent - one merely has to look at the foot chase through the streets of Bangkok, with Jaa leaping, nay FLYING, through the air over everything and everyone, through hoops, under cars, between-over-under-around obstacles everywhere, to see the grace and flow of his movements, and the raw potential that lies within his body, untapped.",/review/rw3023964/?ref_=tt_urv

","In terms of sheer athleticism and martial artistry, Tony Jaa certainly lives up to his billing as 'the Next Bruce Lee'. He puts the kick into this quick-fry Thai fightfest that mixes dynamic set-pieces with skull-splitting one-on-ones. It should also remind fans of the Crouching Hero, Flying Dagger brand of Eastern blockbuster (including myself) that Oriental action cinema was founded on action without safety nets, never mind all that fancy wirework and colour-coordinated mysticism.",/review/rw3023964/?ref_=tt_urv

4 December 2004,RobertMGomez,10," I can't wait to watch it on the big screen.
","My girlfriend bought this movie for me as a gift and it turned out to be one of the greatest gifts I was ever given. I saw clips of it on the internet that just blew my mind, but the actual movie is amazing. Tony Jaa is going to be greater than Jackie Chan and Jet Li. I hope some American studio gets him in a high budget movie that allows him to show a larger audience how amazing he is. So many martial artists or action stars resort to camera tricks, wires or stuntmen for their films. Tony is the stunt man. He spent so many years doing stunts for other stars and it shows when he does his. It reminds me of the way Bruce Lee movies were made. I have seen Jackie Chan movies and even though he does many of his stunts, he still resorts to wires. In Bruce Lee films it was just pure badassness. No wires, just a show of talent and that is what Tony Jaa brings...no wires, no tricks, just whoopass.... I know this comment just went on and on, but there is a minimum so I just kept typing.",/review/rw3023964/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2004,rcropperUK,10," Most awesome, violent, raw martial arts film ever made
","Tony Ja is the new Jet Li and Jackie Chan with a thai boxing background. This guy moves as quick as Jackie, has the strength of Jet Li, put packs a more violent, deadly assault - he uses his knees and elbows for pure annihilation. Why does he use his elbow and knees so much? Because they are the hardest parts of the human body. And god damn in Ong Bak he proper messes up everyone he comes across. Thai boxing is proper hardcore, they don't mess about.In Ong Bak, the story is pretty non existent, basically some gangstas from the city come to our heros poor village and steal the Buddha's head statue, and so Tony Ja commits to bringing it back and restoring peace. Now with that out of the way, let's talk about the fighting as this is where the film excels. WOW, this IS the most realistic fighting you will ever see. The only thing I can compare it to is Ultimate Fighting, but ten times worse. Tony Ja will become a legend this is fact. His flexibility in fighting is so extreme, and this film is basically just crammed up with the biggest, most violent stunts you will ever see. For instance, in a scene where Tony and his newly met friends run away from a group of hoodlums, he gets away in style. This is done by jumping through the tiny gaps, either backwards sliding underneath cars, jumping feet and hands outstretched through a hope, running across people's heads, flippin, kicking, somersaulting absolutely everywhere. Remember when you first saw the matrix and you were like `woah', well this is so much better. For starts, the stunts in this film are REAL. Everybody gets injured. There are no wires, pulleys, fake punches, fake blood. This is how it should be. Hollywood take note. The best scenes come where there is a kinda of street fighter style arena, where the deadliest fighters compete to be champion. Tony gets accidently caught up in this, and doesn't mess around by defeating the champion with a single powerful knee thrust into the opponents chest as Tony bends forwards and twists to avoid the ensuing punch from the opponent then unleashes the killer blow. Everyone in the arena is stunned and Tony gets booed for bad sportsmanship.. But don't worry about that has the biggest fights of his life coming up.You need this film in your life. I haven't seen anything as violent and hardcore as this ever before. But even though its hardcore and low budget, the direction is slick. Double takes are often used for the incredible action so you can really appreciate, for example, taking out three men with a triple, twisting back flip and smashing their heads in with your knees and elbows at the same time with pure accuracy. I have watched this four times now and cannot get enough. Overall, the story line is weak and there are some hilarious cheesy moments, but this all works perfectly well as instead of going `god damn thats sick!' at the beginning, you will end up saying `ha ha! Did you see his elbow get torn backwards then snapped! Ha ha! This is genius!'.  It's like CKY2 with all the accidents, but here it is intentional for someone to do themselves in. This is a film you will watch over and over again, and show your mates everytime they come round. 10/10",/review/rw3023964/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2005,jake-179,10," Incredible! Must be seen to be believed
","This is a great movie, all the way around. This is the absolute best action/martial arts movie to come out since Drunken Master 2. Naturally, the comparisons will be drawn between Jackie Chan and Tony Jaa. The fight scenes are plentiful, and the fight choreography is rapid fire. Its awesome and it is fresh! I went to see this movie the day it came out in theatres, and I was totally blown away. Then, I purchased the DVD as soon as it was available, and since I received it, I have watched it three times. And I am planning on watching it again as soon as I get done writing this review! That is what is great about this movie, you can watch it over and over again and you will be continually entertained and amazed! You have got to see the two incredible chase scenes. The one were Tony Jaa is running through the streets and does the gainer to the two front tucks off that scaffoldings, that is amazing. I must comment now that I have a good friend that can do that exact stunt, his name is Korey. He could match Tonny Jaa move for move, no kidding. And you have go to see that chase scene with the little mini cabs. That was awesome! If you are a martial artist or at least a fan of martial arts movies, you have to get this movie into your collection! I rate this movie a TEN.",/review/rw3023964/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2005,DICK STEEL,9," A Nutshell Review: Ong Bak
","Now this is rare, am actually reviewing a movie I watched on TV. But how can I miss Ong Bak when Tom Yum Goong is around the corner, and I'd actually missed this movie during it's run at the local theatres! I'm not going to go through the details of the story - it's a simple plot about an ancient Buddha statue called Ong Bak, whose head is stolen by artifact hunters, and it's up to local village folk hero Ting who volunteers to retrieve it back from Bangkok. There, he meets up with some friends and embarks on a fight-laden journey to the bowels of the city in order to fulfill his mission.",/review/rw3023964/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you watch Ong-Bak expecting a solid, good, well-told movie, you will want to tear your eyes out and sell them on the black market by the time the film is over. If you go into Ong-Bak expecting an action flick that will make you want to buy a set of extra eyes on the black market just to be able to see the stunts better, you'll be a fairly happy person. If you're the kind of person who can't stand movies without good plot, though, just calmly walk away from this movie and don't look back.",/review/rw3023964/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie is incredible. When head of Ong Bak is stolen, Ting (Tony Ja) swear to bring it back from the thugs. When he enters the city he is forced to use Thai Fist, he learned from old priest to combat Thailand's underworld in arena of illegal underground fighting. The fighting is great, a combination of Muay Thai and Taekwondo kicks this flick is a must for martial art fans.

","Wow! The film overall shows how perfect a debut star can manage the action scenes. He makes us say ""ouch""s and ""ooh""s while watching the movie. forget the illogic scenes, ( Thailand underworld, drug mafias, boxing ring in pubs, replacing Buddha's head etc) it is actually foolishness to find errors in such scenes. I agrees cent percent that the movie is a good entertainer and Tony Ja aka Phanom proved himself with his excellent performance. The direction is also flawless and comes up to the mark especially in the fighting scenes. But i just disagrees somebody who argues that Tony Ja is the good than legendary Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. Both of them did more daredevil stunts than tony did. Let's say Tony Ja is excellent but not the best ever seen.",/review/rw3023964/?ref_=tt_urv
