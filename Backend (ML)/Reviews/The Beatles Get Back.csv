26 November 2021,Sunsphxsuns,10," GET BACK VS LET IT BE
","On May 13, 1970, in Redondo Beach, California, I stuffed a VW bus with my closest musician friends and drove to Hollywood to see the midnight premier showing of The Beatles: Let It Be. Like many musicians who were professionally involved in the swiftly emerging music industry in the 60s and 70s, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr had helped to shape and define not only the rock and roll we performed, but also how we socially and culturally defined ourselves in the massive Counterculture Movement.",/review/rw7585029/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2021,lee_eisenberg,10," you never knew the full story until now
","The 1970 documentary has been known as the story of the Beatles' breakup. As it turns out, that documentary skewed things. Peter Jackson's new documentary ""The Beatles: Get Back"" incorporates approximately eight hours of footage from the making of the album and shows a completely unknown story behind it. For example, Yoko often gets blamed for breaking up the band, but all the members brought people (Paul brought Linda, Ringo brought Maureen, and George brought Hare Krishnas); at times, Paul could be irksome, often interrupting the other members. What was particularly neat was to see the guys writing songs on the fly.",/review/rw7585029/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2021,Michael Fargo,10," The Storm of Making Rainbows
","There's a reason for an 8-hour documentary about the recording of The Beatles final release. Back when, there was such a ruckus and hurled allegations from all quarters: the band members, the critics, the (mostly) stoned fans and interested parties. Today, all of that seems like manufactured craziness, but Peter Jackson recreated what may have happened, offering a correction of what people erroneously believed as a clash of inflating egos and tantrums caused by (1) Yoko Ono's presence and (2) the pulling apart of the group by domesticity. In fact, Jackson lets us witness the growth of 4 talented people ready to move on with their drive towards solo careers. The group was just too confining, the mind-meld between McCartney and Lennon too dominant for Harrison and Starkey. Seeing McCartney and Lennon create--almost wordlessly--is riveting, and watching Harrison's resentment over being ignored or dismissed, painful. But there's a tight deadline for the project. Starkey is under contract to begin a movie at month's end, and the planned project includes an album, a TV special, a film plus a live performance in just 3 weeks. So time puts enormous pressure on getting the work done.",/review/rw7585029/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2021,ferguson-6,10," they passed the audition
","Greetings again from the darkness. It's a lot of Beatles. The three episodes total more than 7 hours of run time. It will be likely be too much for most folks. Not for me. In fact, I envy Oscar-winning director Peter Jackson, who got to go through every minute of 60 hours of video and 150 hours of audio from the 1969 sessions that led to the ""Let it Be"" album and documentary, as well as the band's infamous rooftop live performance atop Apple Studios. The 1970 film won the band an Oscar for best original music, but unfortunately, that 42 minutes on the rooftop would be their final public live performance as The Beatles.",/review/rw7585029/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2021,Lejink,9," Up On The Roof
","The climactic third segment of Peter Jackson's re-edit on Michael Lindsay-Hogg's raw footage for the original ""Let It Be"" feature in 1970. In the intervening 51 years, many of the significant characters here are no longer with us, most obviously Lennon and Harrison, but also George Martin, Billy Preston and Linda McCartney (then Eastman) to name but a few. Me, I'm glad I've lived long enough as a lifelong Beatles fan to see this up-close-and-personal glimpse of them in the studio and of course, in the end, playing live for the last time, on the roof of the Apple Studios building on Savile Row, London.",/review/rw7585029/?ref_=tt_urv

","One of the things about being a Beatles fan since the Ed Sullivan show was that it was fun to watch them do ANYTHING. We weren't inundated with celebrity footage like we are now, so even getting to watch them boil an egg was wonderful. I still feel that way.",/review/rw7585029/?ref_=tt_urv

","After watching the first part of this documentary, I couldn't help but feel stressed out for the band as they put pressure on them selves to meet the deadline. A great job is done directing this and it's a true treasure of unseen footage. Just one thing.... Yoko is ALWAYS THERE!! Literally just sitting there saying nothing and staring.... All... the... time!! Wow... just wow. I guess we all have a friend whose spouse is always hovering lol. Anyway I'm excited for part 2. That's all.",/review/rw7585029/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2021,MReed542,10," A magnificent gift
","What a treasure! If I could give this 20 stars I would. Some of my earliest memories are of the Beatles and I can still remember every word to every Beatle song even though other memories in my life have faded. This film is a gift to the world. A found item in the most magical of attics. To see the collaboration, the talent, the brotherhood in such intimate detail is truly wonderful. I loved every minute of it. Peter Jackson is also a gift and it must have been near impossible to decide what to leave in and what to exclude. Like LOTR he nails it, managing to honor the content without forcing himself of it. It will always be difficult to watch John knowing his unacceptable end but what a great tribute and memorial this is. And sweet George. While others screamed for Paul, I was always a George girl. If I could just go back in time and take the cigarette out of his hand I would. Alas it is the way of things. Thank you Peter Jackson for this most wonderful of gifts!!",/review/rw7585029/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2022,gbill-74877,10," Brilliant
","There is something so transcendent and yet somewhat sad about seeing this old footage, with its incredible level of access at a time so pivotal for The Beatles. At nearly eight hours long it's like the viewer is sitting in the studio with the band as they developed songs for what at varying turns was meant to be a concert, TV show, and documentary. It's a long haul and we do hear some of the material again and again as it's honed to its final form, but seeing the interaction between the band, watching them collaborate, and getting insight into their relationships is truly special, a blessing really, and I could have watched another eight hours of this.",/review/rw7585029/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2021,deanbean317,10," Just as fresh as if it were...yesterday!
","The standout event for me (so far) was watching Paul conjure the song Get Back from a magical void! As he sat in his chair strumming his bass, every Beatles fan recognized immediately the beginning bars of that now timeless classic. But when he initially started strumming...it was nothing...just idle strumming that slowly took form. He then added some cast off lyrics, repeated them a few times, then pulled that unforgettable chorus out of thin air! Even though this was filmed 50 years ago, the electricity of that moment crackled. Even though the unmistakable signs of a band in decay were on full display, as John stated, when their backs were against the wall, the ""geniuses at work"" sign was hung out, and the boys got about creating art. I CAN'T WAIT to see parts two and three!",/review/rw7585029/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2021,blues9981,10," Wow wow and wow
","I don't even know where to start. I subscribed to Disney+ just for this and it is a masterpiece. I've seen the ""Let It Be"" documentary (everybody knows the historic Paul and George argument and ""I'll play anything you want me to play"") but this is way beyond that. I related to every single rehearsal scene (from my experiences) and connected mostly with Paul (I don't want to be the leader and songwriter but someone has to do it). But oh Lord I wish I was Lennon. I knew he was hilarious but I had no idea he was the most hilarious human on the planet. (And a great soulful writer and singer, but we already knew that). There are scenes where Paul is trying to get the others to pay attention to some of his greatest songs in creation like Long and Winding Road, Get Back, and Let It Be...and no one cares. Until they do. And it's a really deep dive into the creative process and mumbling nonsense lyrics and playing total garbage until it all comes together. And drunken debauchery (along with other substances) until you have masterpiece level music. And I haven't even mentioned Linda's soulful eyes and camerawork, Ringo's sad silence before he's drawn into the songs, George's classic songs (like All Things Must Pass) that never made the record, the bizarre goofy blues jams, and Yoko. But I've already said too much. Just watch it.",/review/rw7585029/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2021,bruce350,10," Get Back is brilliant!
","As a big Beatles fan since I was a kid and the anticipation of a new Beatles album was still a reality, I was transported back in time. As you watch the 4 lads come up with new songs, seemingly out of thin air, you get the feeling these guys are pure geniuses. The one part that blew my mind was a scene from 1966 at Candlestick Park in San Francisco. It was just 3 years earlier yet the Beatles had changed so drastically, from 4 MopTops still in the thrall of Beatlemania ('66) to 4 transformed and more mature, wealthy individualists on the verge of solo careers ('69).",/review/rw7585029/?ref_=tt_urv

",Fantastic to see the inner workings of the Fab Four and their creative process. Coming up with songs like let it be and get back on the hoof. Supremely talented. Also great to see the hierarchy of the group with Paul and John calling all of the shots. George being 'the quiet one' and Ringo just going along. Great insight.,/review/rw7585029/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2021,billcr12,10," Magic
","Wow. Watching the Beatles rehearse and interact is mesmerizing. The music is better than anything over the past fifty plus years. My only complaint is the presence of Yoko Ono, who sits and stares into space and does her ridiculous screamimg routine for a couple of minutes each episode. Jackson should have left her on the cutting room floor. Otherwise, this is a must watch for all music lovers. It gives a new perspective on the history of the relationships between the four young men who changed the course of the history of music. Do not miss this great series.",/review/rw7585029/?ref_=tt_urv

","Beautifully breaks down the process a group of talented musicians who went through to make their art. An excellent behinds the scenes peak at what the most popular band of all time (with a deadline) went through with multiple voices trying to steer them in multiple directions. The fighting in the middle if the creative process, pushing of ideas, & ultimately getting to a final result.

","The Beatles were like a soundtrack to my life-long love of music. Being a fan like this I will not see this as too slow, too long, or repetitious. I see it like an unearthed treasure of seeing The Beatles at a nexus of profound change after all of the amazing music and success. Was a new chapter beginning? They definitely had an idea of returning to playing live. This is that story in great completeness. Like a fly on the wall we get to-candidly see the band in trying to harness the greatness for something special and now, thanks to Peter Jackson, we get it. Amazing candid look at late Beatles like no other. Disturbing the peace my left foot...the last concert deserved better than those ""Bobbies"" little snit!",/review/rw7585029/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was about 15 when the Beatles hit the airways. They shook me like an internal earthquake. It was more than music; it was an understanding. A revelation. We were all thinking the same thing. This will sound trite to some. But the evidence of their commonality with all of us is revealed in their music. . NO ONE has EVER spoken with a single voice ...but that generation. They were our spokesmen. In six years, they changed the course of human nature. The world could STILL be saved now, if they remembered that All You Need Is Love. It's good to see the boys again. Future generations should pay attention. An event like the Beatles will never happen again. Never.",/review/rw7585029/?ref_=tt_urv
