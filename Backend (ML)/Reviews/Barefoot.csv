5 January 2008,dbborroughs,8," I liked it. I can't say much more than that
","I'm not a Steve Carell fan however I like this movie about Dan, an advice columnist, who goes to his parents house for a stay with his kids and ends up falling in love with his brother's girlfriend. Its a story thats been told before, but not like this. There are simply too many little bits that make the film better than it should be. The cast is wonderful, and even if Carell is not my cup of tea, he is quite good as the widower who's suppose to know everything but finds that knowing is different than feeling and that sometimes life surprises you. At times witty and wise in the way that an annoying Hallmark card can be, the film still some how manages to grow on you and be something more than a run of the mill film. Worth a look see",/review/rw2048878/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2008,willis066,9," Great Family comedy, enjoyed it more than i thought i was
","When i first got this film i wasn't expecting much im not one for PG comedies not really one for PG movies period (i like to see life as life and i don't see it in a PG movie just me i guess) but this was actually a hilarious movie that didn't need swear words or make fun of people jokes this was a hilarious comedy that makes you laugh at family, love, and the awykward'ness of life i guess you can say. not going to say much but if you want a great family film this is it. there are a lot of laugh out loud scenes in the movie but take a look out for the funniest scene when Steve Carrell and his brother in the movie Dane Cook go out double dateing. hilarious 8.7 out of 10",/review/rw2048878/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2009,claudio_carvalho,8," Plan to Be Surprised with a Delightful Movie
","The widower family man Dan Burns (Steve Carell) writes the column ""Dan in Real Life"" giving advices for families in The New Jersey Standard and raises his three daughters alone. Jane (Allison Pill), the older, has just got her driving license but Dan does not allow her to drive; Cara (Brittany Robertson) has a crush on his high-school mate Marty; and the young Lily (Marlene Lawston) misses her mother. When Dan and his daughters travel to Rhode Island for a family reunion, he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore and they spend hours talking to each other. They feel attracted for each other, but Marie receives a phone call and leaves Dan, giving her phone number first. Dan immediately falls in love for Marie, but when he return to his parent's home, he finds that Marie is the girlfriend of his wolf brother Mitch Burns (Dane Cook), who is also in love with her. Along the weekend, the attraction between the clumsy Dan and Marie increases and they have to take a decision.",/review/rw2048878/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2007,chere43,9," A Delightful Treat for Adults
","The most satisfying element about ""Dan in Real Life"" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is beautifully realistic. The casting of Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was a superb decision; she is exceptionally talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank goodness, appropriately aged for the part! Had this movie been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster.",/review/rw2048878/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2022,HotToastyRag,7," Sweet family dynamics
","Some comedians just can't get out from under their first impression, and audiences refuse to take them seriously. But it's pretty universal that every funny man tries to make a few dramas. The best bet, I feel, is for comedians to make a ""transition"" movie so you can still laugh but also be impressed by some unexpected tears. In Steve Carell's case, rather than jump right into Seeking a Friend for the End of the World or Hope Springs, he did a couple of great transition movies: Little Miss Sunshine and Dan in Real Life. Quirky family comedies, but with scenes that will make the sentimental cry, they show off the promise of Carell's serious dramatic talents.",/review/rw2048878/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2007,screenwriter-14,10," ""Life...love and the pursuit of happiness""
","I was drawn to DAN IN REAL LIFE from the excellent reviews and the thirst for a Dramedy that was well written-thank you Peter Hedges-and because when Steve Carell stars in the film, you know an audience is going to find like in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, a performance that is very entertaining and rewarding. DAN IN REAL LIFE delivered that promise.",/review/rw2048878/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2007,ferguson-6,7," Carrying the Torch
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Peter Hedges' best work is ""Pieces of April"", a very edgy family drama/comedy that I have recommended to many. Although ""Dan in Real Life"" doesn't possess anywhere near the edginess of that film, it is an entertaining film with some clever moments ... though it is much more mainstream (by design).",/review/rw2048878/?ref_=tt_urv

27 October 2007,misterembryo,10," Dan in Irony
","There is a scene in Dan in Real Life where the family is competing to see which sex can finish the crossword puzzle first. The answer to one of the clues is Murphy's Law: anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. This is exactly the case for Dan Burns (Steve Carell, the Office) a columnist for the local newspaper. Dan is an expert at giving advice for everyday life, yet he comes to realize that things aren't so picture perfect in his own. Dan in Real Life is amazing at capturing these ironies of everyday life and is successful at embracing the comedy, tragedy, and beauty of them all. Besides that this movie is pretty damn hilarious.",/review/rw2048878/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2007,DICK STEEL,8," A Nutshell Review: Dan in Real Life
","Comedian Steve Carell burst into mainstream prominence as the world's best know 40 Year Old Virgin, and popularity grew with his The Office US series. But a quick blip on the radar with Evan Almighty made us wonder if he will be able to sustain a series of successes given what I think is a dearth of funny comedians to hit the big screen of late - output seemed to have slowed a bit from the likes of Mike Myers, Ben Stiller (The Heartbreak Kid was not exactly really funny), Will Farell and even Jim Carrey, with whom Carell will be collaborating with in an animated feature in next year's Dr Horton Hears a Who.",/review/rw2048878/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2007,writtenbypatrick,10," Sweet, Funny, Touching...Just About Perfect
","I got to see this film at a preview and was dazzled by it. It's not the typical romantic comedy. I can't remember laughing so hard at a film and yet being moved by it. The laughs aren't gags here--they're observations, laughs of recognition, little shocks of ""Oh, my God, I thought I was the only one who felt that way!"" I won't give away the plot, which is more than just ""Guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend."" The whole family plays a part in the relationship here. Probably the best blend of laughter and warmth since ""While You Were Sleeping."" ",/review/rw2048878/?ref_=tt_urv

11 December 2007,Chris Knipp,6," What's real about it?
","Peter Hedges, who penned the screenplays for the admired indie films What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Pieces of April (and he directed the latter) as well as the successful adaptations of Nick Hornby's About a Boy and Jane Hamilton's A Map of the World, has now guided comic Steve Carell of Judd Apatow's The 40-Year-Old Virgin in a romantic comedy about two brothers vying for the same woman at a large family gathering--which will remind you of the one in The Family Stone, or Home for the Holidays, or for that matter Pieces of April, and a wide variety of American ensemble film comedies--all of which are better focused and more successful than this lame, often cringe-worthy attempt to merge Meet Cute with soppily sentimental treatments of death and sibling rivalry. What was Hedges thinking? He and everybody concerned are obviously capable of much better than this.",/review/rw2048878/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2007,Roxburyfunny1,10," So Amazing and Murderer of Love!~!
","My sister and I both wanted to see this but were debating on going to the sneak preview or not. We were so glad that we went because it was really laugh out loud funny and it's one of those romantic movies that really is just wonderful. It's not all gushy and boring. It is really romantic and funny. There was a couple next to me and her boyfriend was laughing out loud and enjoying it because let's face it, It's Steve Carell's year and he can do anything and do no wrong. I'm not a big fan of Dane Cook but I really enjoyed him in this movie. He was so good in it. Norbet Leo Butz who's my sister's favorite and the other members of the family were casted perfect and they all did a wonderful job especially Diane Wiest and John Mahoney who looks great by the way. The daughters I was extremely impressed with. They casted them perfectly and Alison Pill who I've seen in so many movies is so talented and Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston were both wonderful to watch and were perfect. No characters were overlooked or two small but Steve was in his element and came through so amazing. Juliette Binoche who I loved in Chocolate was amazing and this was no exception. She did so well in her role and Emily Blunt was a big surprise but she was fantastic. The movie is really a family movie, there's nothing bad in it words, sexual content etc... but it's one where you would enjoy at home or in the theater and with the people who you love and like to spend time with. Recommended for anyone who loves a good movie!~!",/review/rw2048878/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2009,CandidlyCandid,," Wasn't Expecting What I Saw
","Steve Carell once again stars in a light romantic movie about choices, family and pressure. By judging on the plot and cover art of the movie I was expecting a flat-out comedy, lots of laughs and unrealistic elements, but I guess I was wrong. Sure the movie had some comedy, but it felt much more of a light Drama to me and Steve Carell once again gave a great performance. The movie itself really tackles true observations and that was a strong element I found. But, the ending felt a little bit rushed and predictable. Through-out, the cinematography was great, the acting was great and the message it delivered was obvious but yet still very important. Though, it came down to old, flat and predictable ending. I'd reckon if different choices were made at the end of the movie (perhaps for the bad, even) this movie would get better publicity. Still a fun movie.",/review/rw2048878/?ref_=tt_urv
