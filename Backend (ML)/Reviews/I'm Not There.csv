3 October 2007,Chris Knipp,8," A film biography that's complex, like its subject
","Haynes' adventurous biopic of Bob Dylan, which uses six actors of both sexes and several races ranging in ages from 11 to 50, is both exhausting and fun to watch. It's also hard to describe. But let's start with those six and the characters or facets they portray. Arthur (Ben Whishaw) is the Dylan who incarnated Rimbaud and serves as a kind of narrator whom we see smoking and giving ironic answers to some kind of inquisition sporadically throughout the film. Woody (the wonderful young Marcus Carl Franklin, an amazing a singer and actor) is a precocious rail-hopper with a guitar (labeled like the real Woody's, THIS MACHINE KILLS FASCISTS) and tall tales that start with his claim that he's Woody Guthrie. Woody's scenes show him rescued by a black family and a white family and performing with country black musicals. He represents the early shape-shifting Dylan in search of an identity and telling a lot of lies along the way.",/review/rw1769126/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2010,wes-connors,7," (I Don't Want to) Chain You Down
","Unless you know something about the subject of this biography, you're bound to be confused by ""I'm Not There"". It is ""inspired by the music & many lives of Bob Dylan."" For the unenlightened, Mr. Dylan was famous, long ago (""for playing electric violins on desolation row""). The film, by writer/director Todd Haynes is excellent, but inaccessible. And, strangely, if you know anything about the subject, you're going to learn approximately nothing knew. To help navigate, there were four main Dylans ",/review/rw1769126/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2020,perica-43151,8," A tribute to Dylan
","This movie can be difficult to follow if you are not familiar with Bob Dylan, but it is in fact a carefully and lovingly crafted tribute, that aims to reflect the essence of the artist's work and life. It is a fun take on its subject, though in order to be fully appreciated, one has to know what is being explored. Otherwise, it may seem a tedious watch, but perhaps that is appropriate as in order to fully appreciate Bob Dylan, one has to pay attention, and then it becomes quite rewarding. The shape-shifting nature of Bob Dylan has been portrayed, quite fittingly, by several actors of various backgrounds, ages, sexes and races - in that respect, it is as original and unexpected as its subject. All in all, an interesting, artistic and original but perhaps somewhat inaccessible - to an uninitiated viewer - tribute to one of the greatest artistic geniuses Americana has ever reared.",/review/rw1769126/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2017,TheLittleSongbird,5," Didn't do much for me
","While not the biggest fan of Bob Dylan, a lot of his songs are great (especially in the lyric writing) and he has an immediately distinctive voice, he is a musician who is appreciated highly by me and it is easy to recognise his importance.",/review/rw1769126/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2008,Polaris_DiB,7," Hey look, a biopic that actually fits its subject!
","This film honestly could not have come sooner. Now that the world has ""Dewey Cox"", the idea of the biopic as cliché (think about it, do artists lives ALWAYS follow that particular narrative arc?) has garnered its own momentum to literally standardize public figures lives into similar profiles. This movie evades and destroys this effect completely by throwing out veracity and accepting all of Bob Dylan's idiosyncratic messages, identities, stories, themes, and creative drives at face value, no matter how contradictory they may seem. The result is a movie that is possibly the ""truest"" version of an artist's life: one that just says everything he does to represent himself is right, and builds up a much more interesting character than a single identity.",/review/rw1769126/?ref_=tt_urv

","This was the semantically richest and emotionally deepest film experience I have had in years. And since I am different now that I was five years ago, it could qualify as near my favorite. It will likely not be so for you, at least to approach the way I did. It seems that you have to be my age, and have lived through the events the wrap this. Also, you have to have invested some part of your personal poetry in that of this man. And finally, you have to be sufficiently cineliterate to follow the amazing shape of the eye-concepts that are serially birthed.",/review/rw1769126/?ref_=tt_urv

25 April 2012,billcr12,5," Disjointed mess
","First and foremost, Bob Dylan is a genius and a perfect subject for interpretation. A great idea with mixed results in I'm Not There. Cate Blanchett opens as Jude Quinn, a mid 1960s era Dylan getting on stage but quickly shown in a motorcycle accident. The British actress looks uncannily like the folk singer, especially in silhouette. ",/review/rw1769126/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2007,mickjongold,9," Amazing! (Dylan's not there)
","This film amazed me. One reason it worked for me is because it's drenched in Dylan's music. I wasn't expecting that. Most of the time, it's Dylan's voice when 'Blind Willie McTell' or 'Moonshiner' or 'Idiot Wind' (the slow, acoustic version) suddenly erupt on the sound track to huge emotional effect. Other times instrumental teasers from 'Man In The Long Black Coat' or 'Nashville Skyline Rag' are planted in the mix like fragments of dreams you can't quite focus on. All the pre-release publicity had revolved around Cate Blanchett is girl Dylan! and Marcus Carl Franklin is African American boy Dylan! but the film itself unfolds like a kaleidoscopic dream where the pieces never quite meet. A bit like me and all my friends scratching our heads in the 1960s and 1970s and earnestly wondering how John Wesley Harding related to Blonde On Blonde, or how Slow Train Coming related to Blood On the Tracks. Well they don't. In ""Chronicles, Volume One"" Dylan dwells on the moment when he stumbled across Rimbaud's declaration ""Je est un autre"" which translates into English: ""I is someone else"". Dylan writes: ""When I read those words the bells went off. It made perfect sense. I wish someone would have mentioned it to me earlier."" That insight has sustained Dylan thru all his multiple personalities, finger pointing folkie, rock & roll rebel, Nashville good ol' boy (Oh me oh my, love that country pie), tormented lover, Born Again Christian. When he performed on his first album, aged 21, he was trying to summon up the voice of a 60 year old blues singer. ",/review/rw1769126/?ref_=tt_urv

31 May 2008,dfranzen70,6," Maybe you had to be there.
","To appreciate I’m Not There., you need to fully buy into its somewhat-implausible premise; in it, six actors represent various aspects of Bob Dylan throughout his many decades in the limelight. If you buy into this premise, then this is a unique, thoughtful perspective of an almost-unknowable individual, a man who famously played things close to the vest, a man who shunned introspection. But if you don’t immediately buy into this premise, then the movie just feels like a long experiment that isn’t entirely successful, and in the end you don’t feel you know much more about the man, the myth, the legend than you knew going in. Which might be the point, who’s to say? And that’s sort of where I land on the whole I’m Not There. issue.",/review/rw1769126/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2008,randyhndrsn,8," This movie is good but in a weird way.
","I recently watched I'm not there and this movie isn't done in a way that really makes sense sometimes or flows, but after the first 10 minutes you really understand what is happening.This movie has differen't stories from differen't characters that come in and differen't times, and they all have something to do with bob Dylan's life.I thought the movie was gonna show one story at a time, but they show one for like 5 minutes then another one and comeback to it later and sometimes only show a clip for it for a few seconds.This is done in a very art-house style and is for fans of the genre, it isn't abstract crap like some movies but actually has some great scenes that are visually wonderful.Some scenes play like Fellini's 81/2 and this movie feels like a foreign film a lot of the time but the characters speak English.This movie is far from perfect for my taste and I am not a huge Dylan fan but I respect him a lot, the movie pretty much does a good job at pulling you into it and you go for a ride.It's well made and the acting is good all around, don't watch the movie if you don't like art type films or movies that focus on characters and out of place scenes that are put there for a visual purpose.It's a cool flick and I think a lot of people can respect it, it's nice to see something original and not in some movie formula like a lot of Hollywood blockbusters we get these days.",/review/rw1769126/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2007,Movie-Jay,8," Saviors Grow Fast Asleep
","Saw this at the Toronto Film Festival. I really liked it, although maybe the Richard Gere scenes are the one's to skip, though it's not really his fault. Cate Blanchett is getting a lot of buzz for her performance, and she deserves it. The actors are all playing versions of Dylan, though their characters have different names. Blanchett plays an incarnation of Dylan that would be right around the time of ""Don't Look Back"".",/review/rw1769126/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2007,Benedict_Cumberbatch,," Beautiful, Unique & Full of Life
","Todd Haynes (""Velvet Goldmine"", ""Far from Heaven"") created a non-linear, truly original film, that must be seen by every Bob Dylan lover. Haynes's tapestry is ""inspired by the music and lives of Bob Dylan"" - he introduces us to 6 different Dylans: Jack Rollins (Christian Bale), Woody Guthrie (Marcus Carl Franklin), Jude Quinn (Cate Blanchett), Robbie Clark (Heath Ledger), Billy the Kid (Richard Gere) and Arthur Rimbaud (Ben Whishaw), interweaving their stories in a groundbreaking narrative slightly similar to Todd Solondz's unsettling, caustic ""Palindromes"" (2004), in which several very different actresses (and a boy) play a 13 year-old pregnant girl.

22 November 2007,Cheetah-6,8," Bob Dylan's 2007th Dream
","Take all the music, everything you've heard, read, seen in documentaries about Bob and throw them in a blender and pull them out and what you get is ""I'm not there"" And it's a tasty concoction of a movie that comes off like a dream of everything that's publicly known about his life. Perhaps even Bob himself dreaming about the course of his life. The more you do know about what's out there about Bob the more you'll be able to make the connections with the scenes in this beautiful montage about the poet, songwriter, and musician genius of the last 60 plus years. This is a great film about a very complicated artist who could never be pinned down as representing any one ideology or persona although he seemed to imply many. I suppose Dylan will always be the great enigma and this film only helps to perpetuate it, which is part of what makes it so successful but as we all now know there's no success like failure and failure's no success at all.",/review/rw1769126/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2008,gradyharp,10," A Successful Exploration and Cinematic Investigation of an Artist
","I'M NOT THERE is clearly not a movie for everyone. The concept of the film is experimental, the execution of the 'documentary' is actually an amalgam of the aura and influence of one man in the music world instead of a linear history of a famous singer/poet, and the goal seems more to find the effect of Bob Dylan's chameleon persona on those people with whom he came into contact than it is to relate the story of a fascinating and important American artist.

5 September 2007,xlr884,10," Essential for any Dylan fan
","I just saw I'm Not There at the Telluride Film Festival. It is AMAZING. The performances are nothing short of spectacular. Cate Blanchett really nails the role except that her voice obviously can't hit the same bass as the real Bob Dylan. She does, however, look creepily like Dylan in many instances and really gets the mannerisms right. Christian Bale is another standout. It should be mentioned that all of the performances are really top-notch, nobody falls short. The music was fantastic, too (obviously). My one complaint would be that the film goes on a bit longer than it probably needs to but not enough to affect my overall score. I floated out of the theater after seeing this one. It is definitely essential for all Dylan fans. Many of the people I saw the film with were not very familiar with Dylan's life or music but they said they enjoyed it as well.

24 November 2007,lee_eisenberg,10," life as stream of consciousness
","Todd Haynes's fictionalized Bob Dylan biopic has finally arrived. And it's a good one. Like Dylan's autobiography ""Chronicles"", it's told in stream of consciousness style. The many different people playing the role (and each person gives the character a different name) stress the many alter egos that inhibit this richly complex character. The character's speed and marijuana usage give the whole movie a very dreamlike state. One can imagine that he probably gets tired of reporters always asking him stupid questions, and that it contributes to the bizarre mental state that we see.",/review/rw1769126/?ref_=tt_urv
