20 May 2016,siderite,9," Happiness is watching this movie.
","Simon Pegg was a brilliant choice for this movie and the whole film is almost perfect as reflected in my rating. Based on a book, the script is pretty bloody good and, while I am usually not a fan of touchy-feely wisdom-on-a-cup kind of things, I really enjoyed the movie.",/review/rw3191368/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2015,johnklem,7," French whimsy with an English touch
","I'd decided on the title for this review before I learnt that the source material was a French novel. That explains a great deal. Hector and the... is a deeply felt, funny, moving, insightful and whimsical look at how we (fail to) make the best of life. The film makes its points adroitly, avoiding (sometimes barely but a miss is as good as a mile)maudlin sentimentality. It's liberally sprinkled with perfect one-liners, acute observations and star cameos but the glue that holds the whole thing together is the relationship between Hector and his girlfriend. It's heartrendingly real. The version that I watched was a full ten minutes shorter than the original runtime and I'd guess that the few dots that failed to join up as needed were a result of that USA audience edit. Another guess would lead me to give the full length cut an eight rather than a seven. Here's the deal. It's a feel-good movie for which you won't need a supply of sick bags. By the end, I felt... happier. Really!",/review/rw3191368/?ref_=tt_urv

18 May 2015,Laakbaar,6," What are the insights?
","This is pilgrimage movie about a burnt-out British psychiatrist travelling to China, Africa and LA to discover the truth about happiness. It's an interesting enough film, promising to dispense grand truths about happiness. However, the movie lapses into cheesiness and triteness. I blame the writing or the story, because the movie was well made and the acting was good enough. I can't say I came out of the movie learning anything profound about happiness at all. The happiness insights seemed sophomoric. I want to finish by saying that the movie had a few nice points and did move me, especially near the end. Worth about 6.5 in my book.",/review/rw3191368/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2014,squirrel_burst,7," It won't blow your mind, but it's a slight film to cheer you up
","""Hector and the Search for Happiness"" is a warm little comedy/drama that isn't necessarily insightful on what it takes to make people happy, but it will lift up your spirits nonetheless. Hector (Simon Pegg) is a, well, there's no other word for it, boring psychiatrist. He is bored with his job, doodles a lot, is basically being mothered by his girlfriend (Rosamund Pike as Clara), doesn't have many friends and isn't really doing anything with his life. One day he comes to a realization that he really can't help his patients get out of their depressions or solve their problems because he isn't happy himself. He doesn't want to admit it to his girlfriend, but he also still pines for that one girl that could have been ""the one"" (Toni Collette as Agnes) that he lost years ago. He decides to take an impromptu trip exploring the world. Taking notes along the way, he meets a slew of different characters, all of which have different views and beliefs on what happiness is all about and comes to his own conclusions after living through all sorts of adventures.",/review/rw3191368/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2015,luisfveloz,10," introspective; Simon Pegg ... Amazing
","After i watched this movie i just felt compelled to write about it, i don't like to use spoilers, i won't deprive anyone from discovering this whole experience, the movie is sublime, with a profound meaning, very human, than i can recommend to all, especially if you are searching for happiness... the story is rich, full of contrasts, the photography maximizes the experience, and the actors are just believable, to say the least, i did believe them all, and also you will believe them, the acting is effortless, they are just great, and one special mention to Simon Pegg, which we all know for the silly roles that he plays, now he will take you through the full range of emotions. my final thought... don't miss it, this is one of these movies that you won't forget. a regular masterpiece.",/review/rw3191368/?ref_=tt_urv

18 August 2014,drturker-bayrak,8," A rather mature film from Simon Pegg
","At the time of writing this review, there is a massive absence of films suitable for audience who does not necessarily enjoy titles such as Expendables III or Hercules. If you happen to be one who seeks some deeper meaning in your movie experience, this film is for you. In fact if you are not, you may still find some aspects of the film entertaining enough.",/review/rw3191368/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is for the first time I am writing a review for a movie despite the fact that i have been a big time movie buff for 20 years. Reason...I was compelled to step out of my own resignation. Of all the brilliant movies out there, this one, in my humble opinion, has the power to shift something deep inside 'most' people. Most.... but not all,,, for some people are so inured into the vagaries of life that they might lose patience with a somewhat slow pace of the movie. Well, losers....have patience...it will pay. If you are someone who values time....YOUR TIME...ON THIS PLANET...you've gotta watch this. There is no incomprehensible philosophical blabbering in this....just plain and authentic experiential learning of a psychiatrist committed to figuring out the answer of perhaps the oldest question of mankind in a non judgmental objective way. Categorically recommended to everyone with even an ounce of brain.",/review/rw3191368/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2014,neil-476,8," Good-hearted drama with humour
","Psychiatrist Hector has a beautiful girlfriend and his life is going well. But despite his successful career he is unable to make his patients happy, and fears this may be due to his inability to be happy himself. So, with the sort-of blessing of his bemused girlfriend, he sets off on an open-ended journey in pursuit of the secret of what makes people happy, which takes him to China, the Himalayas, Africa, and Los Angeles.",/review/rw3191368/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2014,cameronkeys-996-768231,10," This is a really really good movie.
","Caught a screening. Hard to put your finger on, it's not exactly a comedy or romance or drama but it's got all those elements in it yet they all balance perfectly. Really had me. Well, I laughed a lot, so maybe it is a comedy. Everybody's funny in it. Simon Pegg is the best I've ever seen him. Always loved him, never exactly thought of him as a dramatic actor but he sure lays it down here. Wonderful surprise, I hope he does more quality moves like this, he's too talented to waste. Most worthwhile film I've seen all year. Just incredibly satisfying. No spoilers here so I'll just say it's a really great. Going to take my friends when it comes around again. Funny, smart and a terrific ending. Why is that so hard to do these days?",/review/rw3191368/?ref_=tt_urv

","Once I'd watched 'Hector and the Search for Happiness' I felt compelled to look it up on the internet, just to see what 'genre' it was supposed to be. Officially, it's billed as an 'adventure/drama/comedy.' I can sort of see where it's coming from – it kind of tries to be all three, only it doesn't ever stay on one for long enough to pull it off.",/review/rw3191368/?ref_=tt_urv

23 September 2014,george.schmidt,8," Pegg's amiable buffoon gets a life lesson ; worth the trip even if it's @ home
","HECTOR AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESS (2014) *** Simon Pegg, Rosamund Pike, Stellan Skargard, Toni Collette, Christopher Plummer, Ming Zhao, Barry Astma, Jean Reno, Sivan Raphaely. Disjointed and off-balanced yet ultimately inspiring and inspired performance by Pegg (who stretches his acting muscles here nicely) as an in-a-rut psychiatrist whose drab everyday life is taking its toll in spite of a solid relationship with sunny Pike that leads him to embark on a globetrotting journey of the titular emotion. Based on Francois Lelord's novel the screenplay by Maria von Heland, Tinker Lindsay and the film's director Peter Chelsom is unwieldy yet well-meaning in making its buffoonish (at first perceived) protagonist wearing blinders to What Life Really Is and That It Is Inside (and at Home) ultimately encountering other cultures, a few misadventures (including a menacing kidnapping) and bonding with one's fellow man (Raphaely's role as a critically ill airline passenger gives the best line: ""Listening is love"" as the perfect koan for the them evoked. Peppered with some Walter Mitty-esque animation the film takes itself not-too-seriously and keeps its hero on track.",/review/rw3191368/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2014,antciv,9," Heartwarming and thought provoking
","I thoroughly enjoyed watching Hector, the acting and production all top class, Mr Pegg showed his acting maturity and Rosamund Pike played her role perfectly, the final scenes were quite poignant and not what I was expecting at all. Toni Collette at the end of the film giving a strong performance and Hector and the audience something to think about, I have used a couple of the things he discovers on his journey in my life already. Some are a bit obvious but there is some good advice in there. If you are looking for an alternative to some predictable movie with an over muscled pretty boy blowing stuff up, this could be for you. Go see it.",/review/rw3191368/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2018,sergelamarche,6," Fresh and stale bits
","This film came out to me as forced and formulaic. The lessons accumulates a bit too well and quickly to work out except for a couple of them that still sounded real, expecially the bit with the ex-girlfriend. It's strange that a psychiatrist would not know better about happiness, with all the studies about it. This film is more of a mid-life crisis needing a resolve. It's a bit overacted with the actual girlfriend that acts like a little girl but Rosamund is so damn cute and fun. Passable with good bits and not so good bits.",/review/rw3191368/?ref_=tt_urv

","A multinationally produced film product. The story as well won't take place in one place, but travels around the different continents. It is when 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' meets 'The Ultimate Gift'. A very inspiring theme, made by 'Serendipity' director which is his first film since last five years.

","But still more than a decent effort to find ones meaning of and in life. I saw someone calling it ""Dudes version of Eat Pray Love"". That's a funny way of putting it. And it's not that wrong. While it may appear like something more similar to Mr. Mitty (a really good movie about escaping real life in fact, but also finding oneself, through that way), it actually is more like the Julia Roberts movie (or book if you haven't seen the movie).",/review/rw3191368/?ref_=tt_urv
