6 August 2004,vincent-27,," understated brilliance, continuing the great Canadian comedy tradition
","Like most people when I first saw this show I thought it was just another mindless low budget comedy series aimed at the dim-witted pot smokers among us. Then I watched it more and became mesmerized by the underlying brilliance, everything was not as it seemed, from the beautifully languid intro music, to the ingenious documentary style of filming. Much like SCTV, it uses the low budget quality of the show, and turns that into a bonus. THe shaky hand-held camera, the occasional boom mic shot all blend perfectly with the mostly improvised dialogue. There's something uniquely Canadian about this, making the best out of the fewest resources, and it demonstrates the greatness of the show that it does not need huge production values to make you laugh your ass off. And laugh you will as you watch the main characters, Ricky, Julian and Bubbles stumble their way through life. We have all met people like this, much like in the movie ""Fubar"", people who are completely ignorant and emotionally underdeveloped, yet very much content with their position in life. Both Fubar and TPB, the key is not to make fun of these people in a condescending way, look equally at their naive stupidity but also at their loyalty and innocence and genuineness.",/review/rw4853142/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2022,Amthermandes,10," There is a special sort of charm about this show. Know what I'm sayin'?
","I've been an avid fan of the show for about a decade now. There's an odd charm, a bit of an attraction to the simplicity of the way of life that the characters in the show live, that is oddly alluring. Talk about a fictional, worry-free escape in the world of television, this is the epitome of such a deviation from the real world.",/review/rw4853142/?ref_=tt_urv

22 July 2003,mm-39,7," Cult favorite
","This show will be a cult favorite, like another Canadian classic SCTV.  One day it will be showing on US cable and watch out this show will explode. Like the hosers on SCTV, this show pokes fun at Canadians in a backwards way.  Nice to see people laugh at themselves.  What makes this show funny, is some of these characters must result from real life experiences. Everyone either has a relative, friend, co-worker, like Ricky, Bubbles, Corry, Trevor, and J Rock.  J Rock the 29 year old, ridiculous looking White rapper wannabe, who lives with his mom.  Ricky, the trailer park idiot,(Will Farrel of the show) who provides 90% of the material, while living in a car missing a right door; and Corry with his pal Trevor the 2 slow witted wannnabes who end up holding the bag.  Living in East Kildonan this reminds me of my youth and shows how believable casting, and writing overcomes a lower budget.  What's next a show about Postal Workers.",/review/rw4853142/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2007,kellyheiser,10," Incredible, brilliant show
","Completely original, brilliantly written, beautifully acted, perpetually shocking and always quotable, TPB is simply one of the top 5 shows of all time. How many shows have had so, so many memorable, hilarious lines? Only the Simpsons, Larry Sanders, Sopranos quickly come to mind. The subject matter is refreshing and daring, it certainly could never escape heavy censorship in the US. Every line is funny, the dialogue is almost ""clockwork orange"" like. All the characters are excellent, the ensemble works so well together, I love seeing all of them, with their various looks changing season to season. Ricky may the best character overall, but they all have essential roles they have all mastered. I will admit that seasons 4 and 5 are slipping just the slightest bit from the dizzying heights of season 3, but it is still better than 99% of anything else. The Christmas Special ""Prequel"" from a couple of years ago was pure gold. It answered many questions, especially about Randy, and was brilliant. We finally got to see some winter scenes. Hopefully the movie will have some scenes in winter. The Alex Lifeson episode from season 3 should be in the TV Hall of Fame as one of the greatest 23 minutes ever shown. Thank you Canada!!! I am trying to spread the word down here in California.",/review/rw4853142/?ref_=tt_urv

",This show is THE funniest damn show ever produced in Canada.  What a bunch of dumbasses these characters are!  You must see this show.  It is the funniest thing.  Just a bunch of small town folks living in a trailer park trying to make it.  Truly amazing!,/review/rw4853142/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2021,cstover-28468,7," Original seasons good/Netflix seasons not so good
","As my title says, the original 7 seasons that aired on Showcase in Canada from 2001 to 2007 were great. Yes, I even loved season 7, which it seems most other fans of the show don't really like this season, but I do and honestly, compared to the Netflix seasons, you'll appreciate season 7 a lot more. Also, the original TPB The Movie released in 2006 and was pretty good. The show seemed to have ended with season 7 in '07, but of course, fans wanted more of the boys and due to popular demand, a TV movie was released titled Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys, which was pretty great in my opinion. Then another movie titled Countdown to Liquor Day was released the following year in 2009, which was, just Ok, in my opinion, of course. Finally, a 4th movie was released titled Don't Legalize It, which got mixed reviews but I really enjoyed it. Along with this came the announcement that Netflix was bringing the series back and that same year in September of 2014, Netflix released season 8 of Trailer Park Boys. And..., well, honestly, I didn't hate this season. I actually kind of liked it. Though, Mike Clattenburg's (the creator, head writer, and director of pretty much the entire show/movies up until this) absence from the show was very apparent. It was waaaay more over-the-top than it had ever been before, which was definitely a bad thing...ya know....in my opinion. But it wasn't terrible. However, we then come to season 9 released on Netflix on March 27th 2015 and...dear god, season 9 was just...it was so bad. It was so, so bad. I hated it so much. I found myself cringing so often and maybe let out a slight chuckle here and there. I know as shows go on, characters always tend to become caricatures of themselves, but this was ridiculous. In prior seasons, Ricky was at least capable of speaking at a normal volume sometimes. In this season, he pretty much screams every single word he says. The whole season is just bad. And season 10 is even worse. Not much to say other than it's just god-awful. It feels like it's trying so so hard to be over-the-top and give shock-humor but it's just bad in every way. Seasons 11 and 12 were definitely a huge step up from the previous 2 before it but still nothing great. Seasons 1-7 were peak TPB for me and I'm sure most fans of the show would probably agree.",/review/rw4853142/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2003,coadymn,," Unique and hillarious.
","The Trailer Park Boys is a unique and funny television series from Halifax. It is filmed almost like a documentary which features the stories of two friends who are in and out of jail. While trying to keep their drug business running they have to deal with the park supervisor. Bubbles, a friend of the two main characters will have your sides splitting. I highly recommend this show if you don't mind some vulgarity with your comedy. You've never seen anything like it.",/review/rw4853142/?ref_=tt_urv

Angry, skinny, drunk homosexual baldy running the town with his hairy fat Starsky-boyfriend who has a phobia of t-shirts, world's best professional weed grower taking shots in the leg every now and trying to finish elementary school for the millionth time, jug pissing old man taking support money from the government by acting disabled, poor Bubbles with two criminals as his only friends wanting to establish his own kindergarten for cats: Kittyland, a hip hop teen who never watches at the mirror because he wants to think he is black and so many other caricatured characters, that if I could continue the list and it would just get weirder and weirder.",/review/rw4853142/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2014,zaforius,10," The noblest form of comedy i've ever enjoyed.
","At first, it seems like the trailer park boys is a typical cult comedy you should watch if you want to watch something while high, but as the show keeps going you realize that this show is a masterpiece of classical comedy. Made to satirize the everyday life of the lowest of the classes and the problems that run with them, manages to make you laugh, tell the truth and promote human feelings in the most genuine way. Take a look at every character at the show and you realize just how funny everyday life really is. Jules, the responsible guy who never lets his glass of liquor off his hand, Bubbles, the benevolent little cat guy that everyone loves, and lives by fixing stolen carts and Ricky, the full-mouthed little a-hole friend that everyone has, never stops smoking even with nicotine patches on him.",/review/rw4853142/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2019,PCT1970,9," Trailor Park I'd Love To Reside In
","This viewer started watching this show after it had aired for nearly seven seasons. Better late than never. I watched the first episode of the first season and was immediately hooked. I binged twelve seasons in two weeks. Clattenburg has created a sublime mockumentary. This series has excellent direction, writing, cinematography, soundtrack, setting and acting. All of the actors involved deliver magnificent comedic performances. In particular Smith, Wells, Tremblay, Roach, Rolfe, Bowles, Torrens and the late Dunsworth are hysterical. Some of the aforementioned also contribute to the writing and directing of the series. To summarize twelve seasons as concise as possible, the plot revolves around two recently released inmates, Julian and Ricky, who return home to Sunnyvale Trailer Park in Nova Scotia. They are immediately shocked by the changes at the park, however they haven't changed at all. They meet up with Bubbles who completes the threesome and is sort of an anchor of sensibility. However Bubble's love for kitty cats, his curiosity and good nature always allow for him to be manipulated by Julian and Ricky. Julian and Ricky's arch nemesis is trailer park supervisor Lahey who is almost always inebriated and his assistant Randy. Randy has an allergy to shirts and a penchant for cheeseburgers which is chucklesome in and of itself. Julian and Ricky continuously hatch outlandish, zany, bizarre and quirky schemes to get rich quick with Bubbles most of the time observing and sometimes offering to be the brains behind the operations. These schemes are not always legal but I must admit they are clever. While this is going on Lahey and Randy constantly try to enforce park regulations threatening to rid the park of the boys and the feelings mutual. Sometimes the boys enlist the help of the inept Cory and Jacob who are witless, daft and goofy, but are such loveable characters. There is also wanna be rapper J-Roc who is exceptionally funny and Ricky's girlfriend Lucy who also delivers genuine hilarity. There are many subplots throughout the twelve seasons which keeps the series fresh. The plot is uproarious, side-splitting, rib-tickling, vulgar, boisterous, vivacious, raunchy and bombastic. This is one of the most memorable, addictive, superlative and near virtuoso series in it's genre. Season 13 just started but as this viewer streams nearly 99% of content viewed, I will wait with copious anticipation and confidence that the fun filled joy ride will continue. This viewer has already seen the two movies and live shows so in the meantime I'll watch the new animated, ""Trailer Park Boys"" series that dropped yesterday to tide me over or maybe I'll just revisit the series from episode one again. That's how enjoyable this series is if you embrace this kind of exuberant humor.",/review/rw4853142/?ref_=tt_urv
