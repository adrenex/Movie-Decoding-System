23 November 2018,Mike_Devine,4," This 'Mummy' should've remained buried
","One of the biggest blockbusters to come out in the summer of 1999 was an Egypt-set action thriller starring Brendan Fraser. While the film was pretty campy and over-the-top, it worked well and resonated with audiences. Fast-forward 18 years and we have a film of the same title - 'The Mummy' - only starring Tom Cruise in the role of Nick Morton, a treasure hunting renegade who stumbles upon a 5,000-year curse.",/review/rw3727332/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2017,Ramascreen,4," Dark Universe off to a bad start

2 September 2017,spmact,7," The hate is undeserved
","Based on all the bad reviews I was worried this would suck, but I have to say that while it wasn't as good/charming as the 90s mummy movie, it wasn't bad either. Cruise's character was likable, and while his arc wasn't that deep, it didn't really need to be. The mummy actress impressed me more than I expected, since I didn't really like her that much in Kingsman. People said that this spent too much time setting up the following movies, but I didn't think that was the case. There were small seeds planted, but save for the ending and lack of background for Jekyll, this felt self contained enough. Overall the movie had some fun action sequences and decent characters, and made for an enjoyable popcorn flick. I do not regret watching it.",/review/rw3727332/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2017,pjgs200,7," It's really not that bad!
","It's never good when you have to say ""It's not that bad!"" but I think the Mummy is being treated to harshly by critics. It has a 15% on Rotten Tomatoes. Really? It's not a great movie, but it is fun to watch and I thought the ending was very good. It felt a bit like a B- Movie in the beginning, but I still enjoyed it. ",/review/rw3727332/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2017,alanpgini,8," Good entertainment
","I don't know what people were looking for to rate this so low. It has a good story, especially related to other stories of its ilk. The problem is that they sink too much cash in something like this, without thinking of the consequences. There is clearly supposed to be a sequel, but we all know that this is based upon good box office, and well, that is somewhat weird as fr as how they now deem that a success. I guess 50 million in profit world wide is chump change to these people. One thing is clear as always. If your going to do another in the same genre, you better get more than 15 years over the deal, so its new in people's minds. Anyone with any commons sense at all would know this. And to spend 327 million on it, is beyond insanity. Unfortunately, audiences that liked it will be deprived of one by such short sightedness. As well as the critics weird dislike of Cruise. Personal dislike of an actor in real life, regardless of how uncouth it is, or in speculation of motivations in production, has NOTHING to do with a movie. To me, the story is everything, and its a good one, with effects that merely emphasize it, which is always my criteria in whether a movie is good or not. Sofia Boutella is riveting in this role, especially in the way her unconventional beauty is emphasized by her extreme talent. Its her and Eva Green, who are at the forefront of this type of great young actress of the future. There is no prejudice here. I rate it as I see it, and not with any preconceived notions. Its worth the watch.",/review/rw3727332/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2018,AlsExGal,3," What a dumpster fire of a film!
","This is no real CGI extravaganza with bombastic effects, and it has no final battle. But at the same time it's not a dark somber thriller on the verge of horror, and also it's not really an action-adventure with funny quips. It's also not a low-mid budget monster hunting action-thriller.",/review/rw3727332/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2017,trublu215,3," Among The Worst Summer Blockbusters I've Seen
","The Mummy has had countless iterations of the character grace the screen for the better part of the 20th Century. With the 1932 original and the fun but lazy 1999 remake and anything in between, we pretty much got it. It can be scary or it can be action packed as it seems Hollywood has left there to be no in between for this type of film. Unfortunately neither of those extremes apply to this one. The Mummy is a pandering and very meager attempt at cashing in on a potential franchise. It's sad to watch because it feels like the studio made this. This doesn't feel organic in any way, shape or form and relies on CGI filled action sequences, Tom Cruise, and cheap scares that end up being unintentionally funny to progress the story. None of which comes off the way it should.",/review/rw3727332/?ref_=tt_urv

","""The Mummy"" is the first movie in what Universal Studios wants to call their ""Dark Universe."" Yeah, that's right.

8 June 2017,rbrb,3," Actors working to rule.....
","Disappointing. A few good visuals, but hardly any story. The plot: an ancient mummy gets a new lease of life. The actress playing the mummy is quite good but Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe are awful. They play themselves and most of the time seem half-hearted and bored,just going through the motions to get a pay check. Lucky my vote is a generous: 3/10.",/review/rw3727332/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2017,Luigi Di Pilla,4," It was really not necessary to create this film
","I expected much more intelligence in developing this mummy movie. I was wrong. Hey, how it is possible that Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe decided to appear in this mess? The story went over from one scene to the other without any emotions. Some sequences were ridiculous and illogical when you know what I mean now. One star I give to the good special effects. The second star to the fine music, the third for the nice location, music and atmosphere. Finally, the fourth one is for I didn't felt asleep. All In all disappointing and no substance, just a great disaster. A film that never should have been done! Save your money and see therefore the best Mummy movie from director Stephen Sommers.",/review/rw3727332/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2017,TheLittleSongbird,2," Lacks lustre in almost every department
","Despite concerns (such as whether Tom Cruise would fit), 'The Mummy' did have potential. Some of the previous 'Mummy' films, particularly the instalments with Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee and the 1999 film, wasn't crazy about a few of the Lon Chaney entries and 'Tomb of the Dragon Emperor' was a mess. Unfortunately, so is 2017's 'The Mummy'.",/review/rw3727332/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2017,ayoreinf,6," Don't suspend your judgment, kill it and throw it away
","I get it, it's not a reboot of the Brendan Fraser Mummy of 1999 onward. It's an attempt to create a whole new cinematic world, or rather cinematic universe. Populated with super beings, over which none will claim rights from Universal Studios. Beings that Universal own already. It's an interesting idea with some financial wisdom behind it. It could've been a real stroke of genius if it was done with the right amount of levity. The Brendan Fraser style of humor is badly needed here, but he's not here, neither is anybody else who can take himself lightly. So instead we get a dark, pompous serious attitude debating which way is it we should use to triumph over evil altogether.",/review/rw3727332/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2017,jegd-847-631407,1," The Most Expensive Garbage of 2017
","When you watch a movie that stars Tom Cruise you can't see the character Nick Morton, you only see Tom Cruise. That's the problem for most of his films. Cruise also thinks he can still play roles meant for younger actors and he needs a wake up call. We know Tom Cruise as a 54 year old, thrice divorced grown man who had a series of hit films from the 80's. The guy we watch on screen today is an aging actor desperately trying to hang on to his youth. It's sad.",/review/rw3727332/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2017,cruise01,8," Its a summer blockbuster film that entertains with action and opening up this dark world universe. But it ends too soon when it reaches the climax.
","The Mummy is a blockbuster adventure and the start in Universals film series known as the Dark Universe. May not be a great movie. It does its best in entertaining with some exciting action sequences, some decent visual effects, and Tom Cruise taking the lead in this adventure story of Gods and Monsters universe. In all comparison, this film does take itself way to seriously which does make you miss the humor and fun that Brendan Fraser had in his first two Mummy movies until the third one was a complete waste of time. But seriously, the action and the humor of the first two movies is what made it work. ",/review/rw3727332/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2017,aharmas,2," A Boring Mess
","Universal released many of the classic monster movies in the 30's and 40's, and they were fun. Yes, we might say they were loaded with superb CGI or fantastic special effects, but they scared the little ones and few adults, and if that didn't happen, we still managed to have 90 minutes of solid entertainment because the people who made them knew how to make that kind of movie, working with a simple but serviceable script. Eventually there were sequels, not as good as the originals, but I don't think I have ever encountered the disappointment which the new incarnation of ""The Mummy"" shows.",/review/rw3727332/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie is quite enjoyable. I'm not sure why it's getting so many bad reviews.

","Universal Pictures' first 'Dark Universe' movie didn't exactly bode well for what was supposed to come after. Hoping to create an interconnecting universe of classic monsters doesn't work if you haven't thought things through, and as others have speculated, this felt like it wasn't properly planned out at all. The previous iteration of The Mummy, the 1999 version starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz, mightn't have been a 'masterpiece', but it was a good old-fashioned action/adventure movie that was at least FUN and *entertaining*. This one? Not so much.",/review/rw3727332/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2017,ceejay-cj,7," Critics be damned!
","This is a good start for the rebooting of the Universal Dark Universe, if you're expecting a remake of the 1990's Mummy films then you've got the wrong idea. The first thing you should know is that this has NOTHING to do with those movies and are completely unrelated. This is a re-imagining of Mummy's Hand (1940) that started the Mummy series of movies but with a whole new agenda. This time Universal are making these films to link in with all their other monster movies, Frankenstein, Dracula, The Wolfman etc so comparing it with any other Mummy film before it like the critics keep doing is utterly pointless.
