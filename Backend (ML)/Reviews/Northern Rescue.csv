13 March 2019,ammonlcarter,7," Decent show
","Unlike many Netflix shows, this show is decent, it isn't filthy and seems to emphasize the importance of family and forgiveness. Overall good acting and writing. Waiting for season 2.",/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2019,sanclan,10," Refreshing
","Most of Netflix original fair is horrible and I stray away from it. This show is refreshing in that it is well acted, well written, and contains many good components. It is about family, life, survivol, redemption, sorrow, happiness, love, conflict, etc. I highly recommend it if you want a good mostly clean show to watch (hard to find from a Netflix original) with good characters and good stories.",/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2019,pmarsh444,10," Waiting for Season 2
","It's nice to see a down to earth family drama! Watching this was like reading a good book and when it is done, I feel like I am missing my new friends!! Can't wait for Season 2!",/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2020,wawildbill-197-986443,5," One of the most dysfunctional TV families
","It's one crisis after another, with each of the family members. As one thing gets settled, another family relationship is falling apart, thoughout the entire ten episode first season. There is absolutely no peace in this family.",/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2019,egeferentino9,10," Amazing Show!
",I'm only on the first episode and it is such a great episode so far! A real tear jerker! I wish there were more than 10 episodes! Love it love it love it!!!,/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2019,gdump,3," Unrealistic situations and characters make this one to skip
","I got sucked into watching this because of the IMDb rating and the location. I made it through 4.5 episodes, each time hoping it would be better and that I'd find a reason to like these totally unlikable people. I refuse to believe that the father could have risen to any position of command when he totally lacks any semblance of people skills or even basic empathy. His actions in the last episode I watched would qualify him for a solid punch in the jaw from any bystander.",/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2019,somf,3," Really awful
","I have to point out something that really bugs me. Of the 14 10 star reviews, 11 of the reviewers have never reviewed anything before this show, and the other other 3 have horrendous taste I guess.",/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2019,tinakonkin,10," Close to Reality
",As a widower of 5 years this show was very real. I could so relate to the young daughter and her trying to fit in as some of the emotions my own dayghter suffering the loss of a parent. I loved Billy Baldwin's genuine care of a dad. Best show I've seen in a long time. Can't wait for many more seasons. Tina Konkin,/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2019,bghomes,10," waiting for season 2!!!!
","Please renew for season 2!
great show! I love the casting and how diverse it is! We need more shows like these!",/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2019,taraelizi,10," Wow
",I only watched the first episode so far because I needed to take a breather after that intense first episode. Talk about uncontrollable crying. Let's hope the rest of the season is just a good. I'll come back after finishing the season.,/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2019,liljwging,10," Season 2 Now Please
",Once I started watching I fell in love with the characters!! The storyline is amazing!! 100% recommend when is season 2 coming out,/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2019,babycakes-45269,10," Touching show~Need more episodes!
","I binge watched this show right when it came available on Netflix. It's touching, it's about family, loss, things we can all relate to in one way or another. I couldn't stop watching, and I never get hooked on shows. Please bring more episodes, I ran out and need more! Good job!",/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2019,Onetrack97,6," Characters OK, Not Realistic
",The rescue portions of this show are a joke. The ladies are all pretty good.,/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2019,lanadawn-44376,8," So far, so good
",Can I just say how excited I am to see Kathleen Robertson!!! She is wonderful as Charlie. William Baldwin has done an amazing job with this show. It's enjoyable and interesting.,/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2019,DunkelheitVZ,3," Going to drop this after episode 3
","Why there are so many positive reviews, I have no idea. This show is filled with tropes that have been played 1000 times. In the midth of episode 2 I can tell you where every single story arc goes and how it will end.
On top of that, William Baldwin is a good example why you should avoid plastic surgery. His face looks weird and is no longer capable of displaying emotions.",/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2019,bshaef,2," Darn You NetFlix
","This is probably the worst NetFlix show ever. Full of tired old cliches, trite and strictly sob story stuff but I'm ashamed to admit that I watched 5 episodes tonight and will finish tomorrow or the next day because its so easy to watch and get immersed in a fake story and wonder how its going to end. I hope NetFlix doesn't patent the formula for trite crap because I'll watch it until I get a stomachfull which might be a while. Its fun to watch this when we have so much turmoil in our government. I'd rather worry about what they'll find out about mom than I am if Mitch can deep six the border appropriation. Like I said ""darn you netflix.""",/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2019,malcolm-cooke,1," Rescue me
","This is shocking, Terrible acting brutal writing. There is little to the rescue part of the title. Stay away and maybe take up knitting it will be more entertaining.",/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2019,marmilysoyyo-64-133688,10," Fun for the WHOLE family
","Addicted after the first episode. The show is funny, sad, and real. Focuses on family which is something we all need these days.",/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2019,carole13-558-945253,10," A great Family Drama
","I didn't think I would like this series when I first started watching it, but to my surprise, it really drew me in for the whole 10 episodes.
I'm really hoping that there will be a season two.",/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2020,maritz-stephanie,1," Its Bad bad
","Don't know where to start. It's a very unforgettable story. But the few things I want to point out is:
1. The dad is an a$$ the most of the time. Especially the people he work with.
2. If they want me to believe that the two older siblings are still school age then my whole life is a lie.
3. The acting is as wooden as my bed frame. No one even tries to do any real acting. I'm not expecting oscar worthy performances but dear me I don't know where they got these people.
4. The whole story has been done a million times in the past there is nothing original about it.
5. So the oldest girl's friend get her in trouble by stealing stuff and putting it in HER bag and they end up being caught by the police but lo and behold the next day their just best friends again. No ""im so sorry"" or anything.
6. The youngest girl can build robots.
I'm at episode 6 at the moment and the only reason I will continue watching is because I have this thing of not stopping something I started.
The aunt is the only one that's kind of ok and the penguin is cute.",/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2019,oogaboogaman,6," Watchable show. Why does the oldest daughter dress like a hooker?
","Not the worse show on Netflix. Who am I supposed to root for though? The dad seems lost. The oldest daughter dresses like a hooker. (dad doesn't care) The son gets on a bus and goes hours away to see an old girlfriend (dad doesn't care). Oldest daughter's best friend also dresses like a hooker and is a horrible person. (dad doesn't even know who she is even though he's seen her, so doesn't care). Youngest daughter is fainting during spelling bee. (dad isn't there, but finds out about fainting, doesn't care) The sister in law is told not to get back with her cheating ex. (guess what.. she doesn't care!)
Everyone on this show doesn't care! I can go and on.
Dad is the new leader of the Rescue team and the previous leader tells him to go easy on the volunteers. (Does he care? NOPE!)",/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2019,ronandrei,1," A real cliff hanger...
","As in, I want to hang the writers, producers, directors, actors etc. over the side of a cliff until they promise to never work in film or television ever again.",/review/rw4694966/?ref_=tt_urv
