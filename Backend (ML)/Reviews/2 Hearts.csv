4 April 2010,claudio_carvalho,8," The Contemporary History of Iran
","In 1978, in Iran, the smart girl Marjane Satrapi lives the troubled period of the history of her country with the Islamic Revolution with her ideologist parents and grandmother. When she is a teenager, her parents send her to Vienna due to the war with Iraq. Marjane befriends a group of outcast students, finds love and deception and returns to her country to the arms of her family. However, the life with the fundamentalist in the government is repressive and she leaves her country again to live in France.",/review/rw1822915/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2007,MaxBorg89,10," A whole new kind of animation
","Persepolis is one of the most thoughtful, poignant and original films I have ever seen. Hang on, ""poignant"" and ""thoughful"", an animated movie (and based on a comic-book, on top of that)? Exactly, because coincidentally Persepolis also happens to be the first really adult ""cartoon"" I've had the pleasure to watch (Waking Life and A Scanner Darkly don't count, as they were filmed with real actors first, and subsequently modified in post-production). For all their good intentions, the likes of Dreamworks and Pixar always have an eye for what the little ones want to see, while The Simpsons, despite the occasional ""mature"" storyline (basically Homer and Marge's sex life), contains nothing a 12-year old isn't supposed to see. As for Family Guy and South Park, they might be aimed at grown-ups with their merciless satire and, in the case of the latter series, explicit language, but are made with an almost puerile sense of joy which prompts younger kids to watch them in secret. Persepolis, on the other hand, deals with adult themes in a serious, unpretentious way. So yes, it is an animated film. Yes, it is based on a comic-book. And yes, there is the occasional neat movie reference (Rocky III being the most memorable one). That doesn't mean it's a kids' movie, though; it just means the picture was made with a particular style because it was the most effective way to tell this specific story.",/review/rw1822915/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2007,nonsequitur247,," Not your average animated feature...
","...in fact, there is nothing average about this film. Traditionally animated in black and white flashbacks, it tells the story of a French-speaking woman's childhood and young adulthood in Tehran, Iran, and in Vienna during the 1980s and '90s.",/review/rw1822915/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2007,Chris Knipp,8," Festival film, celebrated in France, now an Oscar contender?
","Iranian expatriate Marjane Satrapi's 'Persepolis' graphic novel series (2000-2003) recounts her life to age 24, when she left Iran with her family's blessing for the last time and went to live in France (1994). Collaborating with her Paris studio-mate, cartoonist and video artist Vincent Paronnaud and a stellar French cast, Sagtrapi has successfully transferred her drawings and story to a 95-minute black-and-white animated film. Chiara Mastroianni is the voice for the adolescent and young adult Marjane; Chiara's real-life mother Catherine Deneuve does Marjane's mother and veteran French star Danielle Darrieux is the voice of Marjane's feisty, outspoken, and totally irreverent grandmother. (An English-language version featuring Sean Penn, Iggy Pop, and Gena Rowlands apparently will be released later.) Word on the street is that this more handmade French animated film, now in selected US theaters, may give Pixar's slick 'Ratatouille' a run for the Best Animation Oscar this year.",/review/rw1822915/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2007,inglis-5,8," A very personal yet universal account of the Iranian revolution
","I came out of this movie feeling as if I knew Marjane Satrapi. The way in which the story is told is fantastic - it really is as if you're reading her journal. As she grows up from being a young girl to an adult, at each age the story is told with a corresponding maturity, and highlighting things which seem like very personal memories. As a young girl, the stories she is told are very black and white, and as she gets older the complexity increases, which is exactly what you would expect. Although there is lots of political activity, she makes fun of herself and highlights her own shortcomings as much as she highlights the repressive elements in her homeland. By telling of her own experiences it really is extremely easy to see how so much of it is common to a whole generation of Iranians. Her love of her family and her country came across very strongly, and you really felt as if she had laid herself bare. A moving and entertaining movie as much as it is educational about post-1979 Iran.",/review/rw1822915/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2008,Rick_Bman,9," A wonderful told story with a unique style
","Persepolis tells the amazing story of a young girl growing up in Iran around the time of the Islamic Revolution. Marjane Satrapi does a wonderful job of bringing her story to life and drawing the viewer into her what it was to grow up during a time of political revolution. Using a unique style of animation, that closely follows the style of the graphic novel, the audience is pulled into a world that is much different than the world they are used to.",/review/rw1822915/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2007,moimoichan6,7," A life in cartoons.
","It's quite unusual for a writer to adapt its own book to the screen, especially when it's a comic-book (well, Frank Miller's done it, but that's another story), and especially when it's an autobiographical comic book. That's the originality of this movie, which is the adaptation of a autobiographical graphic novel by its very author. ""Persepolis"" deals with the life, and especially the youth of Marjane Satrapi, in Iran, during the reign of the Shah and the Islamic revolution. But if the memories could be easily told alone in front of a blank paper, isn't it harder to be true and sincere when you are surrounded by a all animation crew ?",/review/rw1822915/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2007,collingonze,8," Animation in black-and-white, autobiographical, growing up in Iran during the reign of the Shah and later, the Islamists
","The black-and-white animation, highly stylized and two dimensions which doesn't attempt to render the usual cartoon 3-D, summarizes in quick, intelligent flashes, often impressionistic, growing up in Teheran and Vienna from a highly personal point of view. The narrative is as original as the art. The narrator, Marjane Satrapi, only daughter of an educated Teheran couple, first sketches in briefly how the Shah first came to power,only to lose it and have it replaced by the fanatical religious regime of today. Educated in a French school, she and her family are rapidly alienated from the so-called revolution; she is sent to Vienna to continue her education, falls in with a group of punks and eventually returns both depressed and disillusioned to Teheran where, with other university students, she must submit to the rule of extreme Islamists.",/review/rw1822915/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2008,monomagazine,9," the book is a fuller experience
","I rated this film a 9 more as a visual complement to the comic book (of two volumes, now bound as one), which I believe to be a masterpiece. If you left the film less than emotionally attached to the characters, PLEASE give the book a chance, because, as is often the case, episodes and histories of a lot of the characters, including Marjane, are left out to adapt the story to a film medium. Having said that, there are great sequences, expressionistic animation, and the wiseass grandma is left fully intact from the books! I can understand why some people weren't emotionally compelled by it though, since the movie doesn't take the time to fill the audience in on all the quirkiness and endearing qualities of the characters as Satrapi originally conceived them.",/review/rw1822915/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2011,FilmFreak94,9," A very different kind of animated movie
","Persepolis tells the story of a young girl growing up during the revolution of Iran. She experiences many hardships, friends and family all dying around her and a new dictatorship even worse then the one they originally faced. Her parents decide to send her abroad to Vienna where she experiences more hardships. Having to deal with accepting her heritage, moving around from place to place, and dealing with heartbreak from unsuccessful relationships. She eventually returns to Iran where things have calmed down, but are still not any better then before. She deals with depression, more relationship problems and the pressures of the new regime. All the while she keeps her adventurous personality, and her happy-go-lucky attitude. Persepolis is not your typical animated film. It's a drama about life. The hardships the main character goes through are some that people go through every day. And while you might not relate to the living in a dictatorship part, you can relate to her problems and with her relationships to her friends and family. This film is a perfect example of how animation can be just as moving as live-action. This is a great movie. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.",/review/rw1822915/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2008,VoiceOfEurope,8," Intellectual and funny autobiographical animation. One of a kind
","Marjane Satrapi's venture to present the chronicle of the Iranian Islamic revolution filtered through the eyes of a lively and cheeky, French-educated young girl is bold and ambitious. To do so by the help of strong-silhouetted, axe-carved, triangle-nosed cartoon figures is even more peculiar. Her powerful heroine  Marjane, named by no coincidence after the creator  however, spectacularly succeeds in replacing and emulating any possible real flesh characters. She is intellectual, witty, utterly impudent and very funny; the essential Euro-kid of the wild and untamed 1970s and early 1980s.",/review/rw1822915/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2007,MattDevivre,9," very good adaption !
","Adapting ""Persepolis"" in my opinion was a very important project. Especially (but not only) during times of fear and extreme distrust regarding other ethnicities it's necessary to communicate better understanding for these cultures. Films are capable reach millions of people all around the world. Therefore this medium is a very effective way to do this (unfortunately it can also get misused in the opposite direction).",/review/rw1822915/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2008,gortx,," PERSEPOLIS - Animated film of the Year?
","I've been curious about the PERSEPOLIS ever since it won a jury prize in Cannes this spring. The buzz was strong, and it's won (or been nominated for) numerous prizes since then. It's an Animated film, which rarely get taken seriously in non-Animated categories. It's even France's official entry for the Academy Awards (THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY was disqualified because it wasn't 'French' enough for the Oscars). Could it be that good?

27 December 2007,abernant_85,10," One of the best films of 2007
","This is a marvelous film. The voice actors in French are superb; I'm not sure whether it will translate in an English dub. The animation is charming; you forget that it's mostly black and white, and remember only how beautiful it is. It is both bleak and hilarious, chilling and human. The ""Eye Of The Tiger"" scene is awesome for being so amateurishly sung in heavily accented English and only just in key. I learned a great deal about modern Iranian history, and relived a great deal of childhood and adolescence (albeit not in a sophomoric way).",/review/rw1822915/?ref_=tt_urv

23 November 2008,Buddy-51,8," graphic novel come to life
","Movies don't come much more boldly original or stylistically unique than the animated hit ""Persepolis,"" an autobiographical tale of life under a totalitarian regime as seen through the eyes of a spirited Iranian girl named Marjane Satrapi, who, after immigrating to France, wrote the graphic novel upon which the film (co-directed by Satrapi herself) is based. Satrapi was a wide-eyed, inquisitive youngster when, in 1978, the Shah of Iran was toppled and a new era of freedom appeared to be dawning for that nation's people. Unfortunately, as is so often the case with revolutions, the new regime - in this case, the fundamentalist Islamic Republic led by the Ayatollah Khomeini- turned out to be even more cruel, dictatorial and repressive than the one that got overthrown.",/review/rw1822915/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2008,bob the moo,," An engagingly personal tale with an interesting background of history delivered with deceptively basic but very clever animation
","As a young woman, Majane reflects on her journey this far in life  a journey that has taken her to be an outsider living in Europe but one that she recalls starting as a nine year old girl in Tehran, Iran. Here she was an enthusiastic young girl raised in an intelligent and liberal family who were rebelling against those in power  at the expense of some of her family being held in prison. The celebrate when they appear to win the revolution but their hopes are dashed when fundamentalists take control, forcing strict controls on women and putting thousands of those who do not conform into prison. As a teenager, Marji continues to rebel but when her beloved Uncle Anouche is executed and the Iran/Iraq war begins, live becomes increasingly dangerous.",/review/rw1822915/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2008,Seamus2829,10," A grim, but captivating account of the human spirit
","Persepolis is a lovingly,hand drawn animated feature film from France, that tells the story of a young girl growing up in Iran,the daughter of left wing revolutionary parents,during the Islamic revolution. It spans something like 13 years in her life, from childhood,adolescence to early adulthood. It was taken from a graphic novel,published in France. Most of the prints in circulation are the French language version, but there is an English dubbed version (I thankfully saw the original French version,with English subtitles). What I really admired was the carefully nuanced use of colour (most of the flashback sequences are in black & white). In an era that is now overblown with 3D computer generated animation, it's refreshing to see somebody kicking it old school style (hand drawn). This is a film that is worth seeking out.",/review/rw1822915/?ref_=tt_urv

28 September 2008,Danusha_Goska,5," Animation: Exquisite, a Ten. Character, Plot and Ideas: Zilch.
","When ""Persepolis"" first made a big splash in the publishing world, I wondered why. So many good books go unpublished and unreadwhy so much buzz from a comic book about a girl living in Islamic Revolution Iran? Now that I've seen ""Persepolis,"" I know the answer. Marjane, the lead character, occupies a parallel socioeconomic slot to literary agents, editors, journalists and opinion makers. She's a privileged, sheltered girl who invests in nothing and smokes, drinks, and parties her way through life while others are out making sacrifices for what they believe. From her perch of assumed superiority, Marjane looks down on everyone except her doting parents and grandmother, lights another cigarette, pours another drink, and sneers. In Marjane's view, Catholic nuns who shelter wayward youth are equally as evil as Iranian Revolutionary guards who torture dissidents to death. Et voila. Cultural Relativism, the worldview that all those who do nothing for anyone claim as their religion.",/review/rw1822915/?ref_=tt_urv
