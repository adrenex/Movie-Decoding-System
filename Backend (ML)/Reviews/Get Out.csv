22 April 2001,jhclues,9," Meet The Oh-NEED-ers!
","Tom Hanks wrote and directed this paean to the glory days of rock n' roll, an era in which even the wildest music still reflected a certain innocence, long since gone if not forgotten, before the advent of Metal, Rap and Grunge.  It's 1964, and `That Thing You Do!' is about to become a hit record for a small band out of Erie, Pa., who call themselves the `Oneders (pronounced Wonders),' but who are destined to begin their musical odyssey know as the `Oh-NEED-ers.'  Drummer Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) works in his father's appliance store, but when the band's drummer breaks his arm right before a gig, Guy is asked to sit in for him.  And it winds up being a case of being in the right place at the right time for Guy, like when Ringo joined The Beatles, and the rest-- as they say-- is history.",/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2006,ccthemovieman-1,9," A Refreshing Throwback
","I remember when I first saw this in the '90s and thinking, ""Wow, what a shock: a modern-day movie with no no villains, no nasty people and nary a cuss word."" I kept waiting for that stuff, and it never appeared. It also has a nice sentimental ending. ",/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2001,moonspinner55,7," Familiar tale told freshly, with appealing cast
","We've sorta been down this road before: 1960s pop band makes it out of their dead-end hometown for Hollywood, but fame and fortune unravel the fun. Still, this picture has remarkable focus, careful period detail, and a lovely cast that rarely (if ever) strikes a false note. If some of the young actors sometimes seem like they're doing Tom Hanks impersonations, that's okay because director Hanks (himself a co-star) seems to know these characters inside and out--and he likes them. We in the audience are quick to respond, and even the conventional parts of the movie work because Hanks rides over clich√©s with verve and enthusiasm and wit. Not a raucous comedy a la ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" (which is what it looked like to me in the ads), this has its share of subtle moments. There is a mean-spirited dig at the Frankie & Annette ""Beach Party"" flicks, and the ready-made romance at the end is sugar-coated, but ""That Thing You Do!"" is immensely likable. It has a huge heart. *** from ****",/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2004,rzajac,9," A Hoot; comes very, very close to being a great movie
","I didn't see That Thing You Do (TTYD) when it came out, and it's too bad. This movie will--strange to think--rank up there with ""Stop Making Sense"" as a classic concert film. Interesting that 1) they're not really comparable, since SMS is real concert footage and TTYD is a mockumentary, and 2) Jonathon Demme is in TTYD!",/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2003,dunmore_ego,8," That Thing Done Well is a Thing of Beauty Indeed.
","A snappy, exhilarating movie, with a slightly 'down' ending, but which nonetheless entertains, without educating (a staple of American cinema). That's not to say this isn't an excellent film - full credit goes to Hanks (as writer-director) for crafting a vehicle in which he stars, that he is not the star of, focusing on the rise and fall of a rock group ensconced in British Invasion-era America.",/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2022,Instant_Palmer,8," Tom Hanks Has A Snappy Thing Going On In This Cinderella Story
","Catching the excitement of a mid-1960s garage band formed by 4 typical all-American young men from Erie, PA, who atypically make it to the ""big time"" with a hit record.",/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2010,AlsExGal,7," Breezy period piece wrapped around a catchy song
","When I saw this movie advertised in the theaters back in 1996, I rolled my eyes in great disdain. For one thing the advertising banner - ""In every life there comes a time when that dream you dream becomes that thing you do"" hit me the wrong way. After all, 95% of us never wind up doing the dream we dream...there is no WHEN in our lives for this event. Plus, I just figured it was an attempt by Tom Hanks to go highbrow via a directorial debut after those back-to-back Academy Awards.",/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2004,TigerMann,," A great little film with cult movie ambitions
","""That Thing You Do!"" is a perfect film about a group of guys in the mid-1960's inspired by Thelonius Monk-type jazz and Beatles-esque pop music. With one hit single, they are catapulted to clean-shaven, teen idol stardom. The band ""The Wonders"" could easily have been the 60's pop group ""The Turtles"" or ""The Beau Brummels."" The film's plot is fairly simple, yet it doesn't veer off into the typical VH1 Behind The Music avenue of excessive sex and drugs. Matter of fact, they aren't even mentioned. Written, directed and starring Tom Hanks, ""That Thing You Do!"" is honest and easily palitable for younger audiences. It rarely strays away from its theme: The climax and downward slope of musical fame. Viewers can also appreciate several 60's pop culture bones, thrown by Hanks himself to a nostalgic audience of youngsters such as myself. Plot occassionally gives way to hype and music, but that's okay. I was sort of looking for that. I really appreciated the ""The Wonders"" drummer relationship to ""Dell Paxton,"" a jazz musician that's obviously a Thelonius Monk reference. Check them out jamming together during the third act of the film. Now THAT'S what I call truly remarkable music. The song ""that thing you do"" could easily have been a number one single in 1965. It's a simple, hook-laden piece of popcorn that's catchy on a near paranormal level. It was written by members of the modern pop/rock group ""Fountains of Wayne."" One can only wish for more music such as this today. There's enough innocence in it to guarentee parents' wide-eyed approval ... and just a bit of angst to attract the attention of hormone-raging teenagers the world over. Definetly an excellent movie for your shelf ... right next to your DVD copies of ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""The Beatles Anthology."" Also ... check out ""The Beau Brummels."" Rhino Records has issued a great best-of package. One has to wonder if Tom Hanks had them in mind while writing the script. They had a few hits, though none will be as remembered as the poppy ""Laugh, Laugh."" A true gem from 1960's rock 'n roll.",/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 1999,SKG-2,8," Light but charming film
","Overall, I have to say I enjoyed Hanks' feature directing debut(this is not, by the way, the first time he sat in the director's chair; he directed a segment of a Showtime film noir series; I think it was called CITY OF ANGELS).  He did a convincing job not only recreating the time, but also the music, which sounded like period music without being a pale shadow of it. He also made a wise choice for his lead; Tom Everett Scott may not have moved on to bigger things yet, but as this film shows, he's destined for them.  Steve Zahn is funny as always, Hanks does well playing a company man, and Liv Tyler is quite luminous(though I could have done without the ""thousand kisses"" speech; that was melodramatic).  On the down side, I'm not a big fan of Johnathan Schaech, but his character was too much of a caricature.  And sometimes it was just too light.  Still, this was overall an enjoyable movie.",/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2008,Bowserb46,9," And now there's a 'director's cut'?
","I've been seeing this movie on cable for several years...all the way through a couple times, but pieces many times. It seems like I can't pass it up when I'm flipping channels. And it happened again today, but to my surprise, it was a different, longer movie. I don't recall the original running time, but today's version must be 30 minutes or so longer than the one I've been seeing for years. At 2:35, it should have been too long, but it didn't seem like it.",/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2001,famousgir1,10," The Amazing Tom Hanks Can Do No Wrong.
","Tom Hanks directs, writes and stars in this brilliant rock 'n' roll movie, which features a great soundtrack too. I love the 50's/60's days, so this movie was perfect for me. There was some great acting here too, especially, by the brilliant Tom Hanks. This is a movie, that everyone should see. That Thing You do, definitely deserves a 10/10.",/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2020,rayres0708,10," A classic
",I saw this movie for the first time as an 11 year old. Since then I have watched it probably fifty times. It's absolutely perfect. I love the aesthetics of the 60s. The cast is great and the script is hilarious. Seriously there is nothing to criticize about this movie.,/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2001,hbs,8," sweet, nostalgic story of a rock band
","My guess is that Tom Hanks is a really nice guy. He certainly seems like it when he's interviewed, and since he wrote and directed this movie, and it's really nice, too, that seems to be more evidence.",/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv

23 April 2005,bob the moo,," Lacking a bit of depth but breezy and enjoyable with a nice sense of period
","In small town America, a group of friends gain a new drummer in the shape of Guy Patterson and a new band name in the ""One-ders"". Getting the crowd going at their school competition with their catchy number ""That Thing You Do"", the One-ders get offered a gig at a local bar. The local buzz takes a few minutes to get going but soon their song is the talk of the town's youth and they decide to print the record up themselves. When a small time manager picks them up they get a few more gigs but things really start to move when they get signed by Play-tone and manager Mr White. However with increasing fame comes the adrenalin rush of success but then tensions, creative differences, distractions and all the stresses of their 15 minutes.",/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2005,hisown,9," LOVE this movie!
","As a child of the 60s and a musician, I loved this movie from the first few minutes of it. The sets, the clothes, the music, and everything down to the small details is represented here to give a true feel for what the early to mid sixties were like, minus the politics and Vietnam. Before radio music became a commercially diluted and corporate industry there were ""garage-bands"" galore and many of the little-remembered names of the genre started out as such. The Wonders in ""That Thing You Do!"" could easily be a number of bands that were a one-hit-wonder (or two or three) and then just disappeared from the scene. Nevertheless, they all helped shape some of the best music of that era, and Tom Hanks perfectly represents that phenomena in this movie. If you remember the early 60's fondly, you should truly enjoy this film and it will probably bring back fond memories. The depiction of Erie, PA during this time-frame is probably representative of many small to medium size American towns and certainly brought back great memories for me of better times gone by. The music rocks, the dialog is hip, and the love story rounds it out perfectly. Buy this movie and then buy the CD soundtrack; you won't be sorry! (**TRIVIA: another Tom Hanks produced movie, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", has a ""That Thing You Do!"" song played during the wedding reception - do you know which one?**)",/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv

13 December 1998,LSeals,9," Entertaining and mostly musically accurate for the period
","I just finished watching this again tonight and am still impressed by the little details that Hanks gets right such as the period guitars and amps (loved seeing those blond Fender Bassman amps), awful PA systems and other musical trappings of the period.  The music is infectious (I liked the song they played in Wisconsin that Lenny sang - can't think of the title) and there's a lot in there that I still remember about having a garage band back in that era.  There's just so much right about this movie that I'd recommend it to anyone.  Another impressive score for do-it-all Hanks.",/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 1999,Rumples,8," I don't want to gush but...
","This is really a great movie, no question. I rarely watch a film that is so skilfully crafted and yet is completely inoffensive to any segment of society. The movie combines comedy (and some parts are definitely funny) with romance in a tender-hearted tale of friendship and growing up. I simply cannot recommend this movie highly enough except to say that this is a film I could watch multiple times. Brilliantly acted by a still maturing cast ensemble, witty dialogue, it's got it all. If you want to see something that with touch you and give you a buzz but you don't want to be assailed by profanity, violence, or sexuality - That Thing You Do! is the movie for you. Another Hanks triumph, not just for his role in the movie but for putting it all together.  8/10",/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2009,brianlaughran,10," A very good movie to say the least.
","First things first, i have to hand it to Tom Hanks. The man can direct and act. ""That Thing You Do"" is a movie with no antagonist, no good guys and yet it's a great movie. It follows the story of the Wonders, a band Eerie, Pennsylvania who make it big with their hit single, ""That Thing You Do!"" They are then picked up by a major record company and are headed off on tour. The rest of the film follows the relationships that blossom and wilt within the band as they climb the ladder of success.",/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2012,TxMike,," Nostalgic look back at the 1960s, when I was a beginning college student.
","I had seen this movie a number of years ago but didn't remember much about it, so I saw it again today on DVD from my public library. I was a college Freshman in 1963/64, when the Beatles were first gaining popularity on this side of the pond, and this movie fairly accurately recreates that period, the way people dressed, and how teenagers reacted when seeing their pop idols live in concert.",/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2004,ShadesDdrummer,10," A Cathartic Release
","If you have ever been in a band and dreamed of getting out of the garage and onto a stage,then this movie is definitely for you! No matter when you had this dream,you'll experience all the pleasures and joys of being a musician,,,and of course all the downfalls.Yes,it is from a time that won't return,when the music business wasn't such a meat parade and had to do with eager talent.That was then and this is now. Still the characters represent the different types you'll come across,the egos, the clowns and the luck of being at the right place at the right time.At this point in time,it is also interesting to see how the cast members have gone on to other projects,the most recent being Liv Tyler in LOTR,Giovanni Ribisi in COLD MOUNTAIN,Thom Everett Scot in ER and I think that Hanks fellow has been around doing this and that.",/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2000,dfranzen70,6," A simple fable from simpler times
","Oh sure, we've all seen what this movie's about - the rise of a All-American musical group in the early sixties. And it's chock full of the kind of fellas you'd expect to see in a band, too: the shy one, the wild one, the cute one, the smart one. Obviously these kids are patterned after the Beatles, and Tom Hanks wisely wrote into this one the fact that the ascension of the band takes place shortly after the Beatles' own climb.",/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2006,planktonrules,7," Charming homage to the early 1960s
","This film is a very slight film that probably won't change your life or have you announcing that it's the greatest thing you have ever saw. But, it is still worth seeing--particularly if you'd like to see a little slice of life film about the early 1960s and the burgeoning rock and roll industry. The movie is about a fictional singing group that called itself the ""Oneders""--a poor choice in names as although they pronounce it ""wonders"", many of the confused fans call them the ""O-needers""! Anyway, despite the poor choice of names, this young local boys perform a song called ""THAT THING YOU DO"" and it becomes a smash sensation--catapulting them to instant, and very brief, stardom. How this journey occurs and how they all ultimately deal with this is what makes the film worth seeing. The characters actually seemed pretty realistic and likable--not just caricatures like you see in some films. A good, fun film for the whole family with enough going for it to held your interest.",/review/rw1421054/?ref_=tt_urv
