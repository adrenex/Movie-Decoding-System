7 October 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Good Crime Drama!
","After reading all the great reviews for Hightown I thought I'd finally give it a chance. I'm glad I did because it was definitely worth watching. It's a crime drama about the war on drugs that has everything from drug use, drug dealers, corrupt cops, murders, etc. This is a lot better than your average crime drama because of its writing but mostly because of acting performances from its two stars, James Dale Badge and Monica Raymond. Hightown will hook you from the very first episode and hold on to you until the end. I'm glad that's it's already been renewed for a third season because it definitely deserves it.",/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Worth Watching!
",Hightown follows Jackie Quinores (Monica Raymond) and Ray Abruzzo (James Dale Badge) as they investigate serious crimes in Cape Cod. Quinores has a history of drug problems while she struggles to stay sober and Abruzzo spirals out of control from the stress of the job. Those two are at odds most of the series but really do work well together and will do whatever it takes to get the bad guys. It shows the lows of substance abuse and how the opioid epidemic has really effected people and torn peoples lives apart. Hightown is a fast paced thriller that will keep you entertained throughout the series.,/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2020,darrel076,9," This is a darnn good series!
","Murder, drug addiction, sex.......whats not to like? Once you actually watch the show,you'll see this gets very interesting. The story is layered , and the character development is well done.",/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2020,thebricks,10," One of the best shows this year?
",Looking at the ratings and am a bit befuddled. I too thought I would hate this show. I just saw a lot of red flags and thought they were going to rub agendas in your face left and right. Something about the marketing got my attention and I gave one episode a try.,/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2020,kirbie2182,5," You guys do realize it's called HIGHTown right
","It's Called HIGH town for a reason. I'm not sure if other reviewers realize it's a show that revolves around characters who have been affected, in one way or another, from the opiate crisis. So, why all the complaints about the drug use and fault it for showcasing how hard the process of recovery actually is. As well as showcasing how sad and depressing addiction is. The process of Recovery, just like the process of addiction, doesn't happen overnight - it's a long grueling process with lots of highs and lows as well as setbacks and relapses. So, I can excuse it for focusing the majority of its attention on it. It's bleak yes, but so is addiction and recovery. They're no walk in the park. Also, Cape Cod is very LGBTQ friendly, both in real life, and on the show. Hating on it for these two reasons alone is where we end up seeing 99% of the complaints thus far. Nudity is also a reality (especially in beach/party town such the Cape. I do agree with others about how some of the side stories feel like different shows in some scenes, but I can tell that it's just trying to introduce all the main characters, and there are quite a bit of them. Only one Episode has aired so far, so I wouldn't be so quick to judge the entire series based on one episode alone; even though I too didn't find it to be the most entertaining episode in the world either. Nothing really hooked me and there was no cliffhanger to keep me wanting to come back; however, unlike other reviewers, I'm not going to trash it solely based on sex & drug use, nor will I trash it for taking its time. I'll wait to see if it gets better, but so far it's pretty by the books, and not all that interesting...yet. And yes, there is a murder, which several of characters will be involved in in one way or the other, so we still have that crime solving aspect to look forward to. I'll admit it does take a back burner to the opiate crisis; though, what do you expect from a show called HIGHTown? It's going to be about drugs people. It says it right there in the title. For the people criticizing an actress for taking a role as a lesbian drug addict, instead of portraying the same character they associate the actress with is ridiculous. Sorry to break it to you, but a lot of people, respectable decent people, are or have been, drug addicts (either recovering of Get over yourselves please.",/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2021,RJBrez,8," One of my favorite shows of the past year
",I found season 1 during the pandemic. The cast is pretty stacked so I figured I'd give it a shot. I'm an addict (sober 3 years) so these types of shows can be very insulting if it isn't authentic.,/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2022,Backwards710,7," Decent, worth watching.
","There are some cliches and tropes that are over played and some plot holes and suspend belief moments but overall the show is well written, well acted, and well directed.",/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2020,FilmMcCool,8," Not for Prudes
","It is too early to go overboard here as it is only episode 1 but it looks like a good start. It is a reflection of life, esp in the kind of places where the episode is set so the different approaches are part of the story. If one is a prude or homophobic and think only heterosexual relationships should be portrayed on screen well this is not for you.It is a familiar cop story if done in a different way and I will update this review as it moves forward.",/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2020,artgrowden,9," Are we watching the same show?
","Maybe it's because too many of you only watched one episode (if that) but I found even the pilot well done. Maybe it's the fact that the main character is a lesbian. I don't know but this is a good series with good characters, excellent acting and great production values. Give it a try and ignore the haters.",/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2020,michri-1,8," I live in this community and I work with addicts. It's closer to the truth than you think.
","I guess you could say that I am a ""townie"". I grew up and live on Cape and I work in addiction recovery. Once you get beyond the language and the sexual situations, you are left with 2 stories, the fictional murder/cop drama and the very real story of addiction and recovery which is messy and hard and has a lot of setbacks. It is an important story to tell and I am glad they are telling it even if it's uncomfortable for some people to watch. It's also important to see that this is a very bad problem even if you live in what would be considered an affluent community. Opiate addiction is a very bad problem here on Cape. So for those reviews that say this show is elitist, well, addiction affects the elites as well.",/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2020,mwltrz-743-56021,8," Pleasantly surprised
","Hightown offers a familiar drug-related murder mystery story but brings excellent dialogue, representation, and character development to the table. I didn't expect much from this series, but the pilot has me genuinely intrigued. Each performance is compelling, especially Monica Raymund's. The Cape Cod setting is a nice change of pace, and the show does an excellent job of setting itself apart from your usual big-city cop show. I think this show will do great if given the right exposure, I just hope it doesn't get lost amongst the Starz audience who seems to mostly be interested in period pieces. Would hate for it to see the same fate as Counterpart, another excellent show that NOBODY watched. If you enjoy mystery thrillers, this show is fresh and well produced. You won't be disappointed.",/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2020,DKSPL,8," Seriously?
","People give poor ratings just because there are lesbians on the show? Really? Are we going back to the Middle Ages? I really don't understand this stupid hate. Series is great to watch. Yes, this is not a masterpiece, but neither does it deserve such a hate. After 3 episodes I give a rating of 8/10. Let's see what will happen later.",/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2021,ultra-taya,7," Not a must-watch but still good
","Well, it´s neither a gamechanger series, nor a must-watch. But nevertheless I still enjoyed it. You should not expect a crime series like True Detective, The Bridge, The Killing or any other Netflix crime show which has led the top 10 for more than a week. But you can expect a nice ´´evening-filler´´. I find the story of Renee and Det. Abruzzo very interesting and mostly watched for them. Do not worry about the negative comments and give it a try.",/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2022,beastiex,8," Season 2 a big improvement
","I enjoyed season one but the second was truly brilliant. Lots of double crossing,murders and sex whats not to like? The season finale left a lot of unanswered questions so lets hope there is a season three.",/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2020,virtual-93888,9," I Freaking Love This Show
","There aren't many shows with the storytelling ability of High Town. Very gritty and authentic. As a New Englander I can attest to it's ""wicked"" spot-on depiction of The Cape.Great characters. Diverse and smart. It reminds me of Law & Order SVU but it takes over where the Law & Order franchise has become stale. Leads Jacqui and Ray could easily be the new Elliot and Olivia. The plot twists are awesome. Just when I thought I had all of the characters figured out based on some usual tropes they threw me more than a few curve balls. I can say I'd pay to watch this show and I am - I purchased a Starz subscription just for High Town! Can't wait for Season 2.",/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2020,skiffx,9," No clue why the poor rating after 1 ep
","Great 1st episode and sorry that it pushes your sensitivity buttons with all the drug and alcohol use, grow up! Great show so far judging, again, by only watching 1st ep.",/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2020,jim-man,7," A show with drama and human interest
",I'm impressed by the pilot episode. The protagonist has the engaging mix of toughness and vulnerability.,/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2022,matt-65395,10," Loved it!
","This show really captures the feeling of a seaside town that's filled with people living on the edge of life in a way not many other shows can achieve. It's slightly dark but the characters have both a light side and dark side, they are realistically complex and likeable. It's fun to watch. The storyline may be not be anything amazing but the show is made by the way it's shot, the way it feels and sounds and the acting. It moves fast and again, the acting is superb. Loved it and I hope they keep making more of it. It's quite unique.",/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2022,digitalbrian,7," I like it but.
","I like this show, has a great vibe to it, but that being said I wont get too invested, shows like this rarely stay around for more than 1-3 seasons.",/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2020,fryguy-88668,8," Based on first episode only
","As others noted, this is for adults only! An intense show with explicit depiction/discussion of sexuality and substance abuse. If that bothers you watch something else. I though the first episode was very promising. Gritty and gripping with just the right amount of humor blended in to keep it real. I was impressed by the cast particularly the lead. I also thought they gave an honest, open but not over the top look at the LGBT scene in Provincetown but can't say that I have been there, or that it's my scene...and of course it is told from a single person's POV which won't represent a universal experience.",/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2020,notar0b0t,8," Season 1
","I watched it as soon as it started airing; mainly because of Monica Raymund. Speaking of her, her performance in this show is much more engaging than in Chicago Fire or Lie To Me.
There's really only one character I didn't like (Ray), and a few I did like, such as Jackie, Junior and Osito (what a great bad guy & Atkins Estimond's brilliant!).
Oh, and Charmaine's gonna be a great antagonist for season 2. Imani Lewis is a great actress and I do hope we see more of her in season 2.
Overall, a good season with a sluggish start/first episode but they had a lot to set up.",/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2022,icatq,8," Superb!
","I didn't expect S2 to be as good as S1, but it just gets better. A great mix of characters and a riveting storyline set in beautiful Cape Cod make this one of my favourite shows on Prime.",/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2020,Xavier_Stone,4," Some good, but mostly bad
","I quit after episode 4, couldn't handle the scatterbrain scenes that seldom make any sense. It tries to be edgy and on par with HBO or Starz throwing in nudity, lesbian sex and guys jacking off to porn. Once you make it through that then there is a wanna be cop trying to solve a murder, which she does rather poorly as she's going through an addiction.
It's frustrating to watch as each character struggles to make themselves relevant to the story. I'd summarize it as a stumbling Law and Order series with all of the actors/writers that didn't make the cut.",/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2020,meldondg,8," Give it a chance.
","The first two episodes were so-so but series gets better with each subsequent episode. Midway through the season I give a rating of 8/10. I hope the next 4 episodes will be even better. However, I already know that I would like to see the second season of this series. Starz, can you hear me?",/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2020,vladius-59996,10," Breathtakingly beautiful contemporary series. What's up with the rating?
","I don't understand why such an unfairly low rating for the series? It captures from the first episode. Live high-calorie characters, beautiful dialogues. The main character is generally light. Game actors on top. It is interesting to observe the development of the plot. Everything is in the series. I really liked it. And I was very surprised when I saw such a low rating on imdb",/review/rw5908330/?ref_=tt_urv
