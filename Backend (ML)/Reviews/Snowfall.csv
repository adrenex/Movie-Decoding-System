29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," So Good!
","Snowfall really is one of the most underrated shows currently on television. It's hard for me to even describe how much I like this show. I fell in love with from the very first episode. The writing, acting, look and feel...all of it really make it seem quite realistic. It's about a 20 something year old smart student who rises to the top of the crack cocaine business in Los Angeles in the early 1980's. The writing and acting are some of the best on tv and the reason why this show is so good. The lead actor (Damson Idris) has a bright future ahead of him. This is a show that's definitely worth your time.",/review/rw4347544/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2017,Br4ve-trave1or,9," FX has another winner
","I never stamp my approval after two episodes and I'm sure I'll update this, but I need you to know what you're missing out on! Forget the mixed reviews they probably had some kind of expectation, going into this with an open mind and you'll find so many sub-plots that are intriguing, characters that are likable and you'll notice that you want the narrative on each part not shifting only to shift and feel the same. It's John singleton everybody you can't go wrong!this show is extremely entertaining and compelling! It's the most fun I have in front of a TV of a TV for an hour. It had all the ingredients. Don't miss out it's a phenomal show during a fantastic era",/review/rw4347544/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2017,Warren_Scott-55087,8," Snowfall recounts the beginnings of the crack epidemic that plagues our country to this very day.
","Hmmm... OK... I've been reading reviews on IMDb for many years now for I am an avid fan of movies and TV. After reading some of the poor reviews for Snowfall, I decided to become part of the community. I don't feel this show glorifies or romanticizes the beginnings of the crack era, it just tells it like it was. It was one big party and there was lot's of money to be made. I Thought the pilot captured the 80s in East LA precisely and the soundtrack was aces. I felt the story line was interesting and it kept my attention to the very end. I also thought the acting was on point and the best is yet to come. Different strokes for different folks people.This is my unbiased review and I say this show will be around for awhile.",/review/rw4347544/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2022,interestingstuff,8," This show had a lot of potential
","This show had a lot of potential but writers did a disservice to it. The acting is nice and I like the way they rebuilt 80s from scratch with clothes, furniture, environment and everything else. I even liked the first 3 seasons or so but that's about it.",/review/rw4347544/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2021,Supermanfan-13,9," Ridiculously Underrated!
","Snowfall will hook you from the start and not let go! It really is one of the better new series of the last few years that is quite realistic and gritty. It's classic John Singleton, it's actually up there with the best he's ever done! I guarantee you that once you start watching it you'll become addicted and want to binge watch the entire series as fast as you can. Do yourself a favor and go watch this incredible show immediately!",/review/rw4347544/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,kevin_robbins,10," This has a unique storyline and characters that are easy to root for even if they are the bad guys
","Snowfall (2017- ) is a series I recently finished watching through season 5 on Hulu (all caught up). The storyline follows a young man in Compton during the initial rise of the crack epidemic. He makes the right connections at the right time and sets himself and family up for life. Just when he gets enough money and connections to go legit, the house of cards starts crumbling.",/review/rw4347544/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2022,JamesR1973,8," Great series, although S5 not as good as the others
","Really enjoyed this from the beginning. It has some great actors, locations and an engaging storyline linked to the murky dealings of the drugs/arms trade during the 1980's between the US and Central/South America.",/review/rw4347544/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2017,jonmccann,9," This is good TV!
","It could be considered a bold move, putting on a new to air show, with relatively unknown actors, at the same time that big series are coming back and on air, such as Game of Thrones, Ray Donovan, Ballers etc!",/review/rw4347544/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2017,burrisd,9," Great Start...
","I do not review that many titles but felt compelled to write a review after seeing the negative ones. While it is possible that this show will end up taking a dive as it progresses - I can say that the beginning so far has been great and has true potential. It sort of reminds me a little of a Breaking Bad type of show. I seriously doubt it ends up being as good as Breaking Bad, but if that is the type of show that you like then you should really consider giving this one a shot.",/review/rw4347544/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2022,itsoferrall,10," Ending of season 5 is so good!!
",I was worried about where the story was going but by the end of season 5 I was like WHOA.,/review/rw4347544/?ref_=tt_urv

19 May 2022,natalietoi,10," I am hooked!@
",Brilliant. Stunning. Amazing. Devine. The BEST series fm 1 - 5 on TV in the last 5 years. Acting better than 95% of the movies released since 2019.,/review/rw4347544/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2021,lambiepie-2,9," Snowfall recalls the worst of the 80s
",Make no mistake - the 80s had two horrific things that took focus: HIV/AIDS and the crack epidemic. This is about the crack epidemic.,/review/rw4347544/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2017,info-75439,8," Every story has a beginning...

23 April 2019,brandonneicke,10," Top notch
","I was excited for this show, as I grew up in a neighbourhood infested with crack. I grew up with it in my house my mother was an Addict and saw first hand dealings and drug use from crack. I wasn't sure how accurate this show would be as it seems every movie that shows crack is never accurate to what it is and what it can do to ones life. They also don't explain the opportunity enough either. This shows main character franklin is a good kid who is fed up of living in poverty and wants to make a life. Finding crack was his way out. Unfortunately with that you end up in a lot of trouble. Amazing cast very realistic and I love the 80s 90s style. I just heard John Singleton had a stroke and I was scared for this show I hope he gets better and continues to make art",/review/rw4347544/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2018,scicero1,10," Another Great Hit
","So many reviews are personal opinion and copy pasted information summarized from other web pages or straight garbage. I'm sorry, this show is amazing, true to its word, the acting is electrifying, its draws you in so much you are truly hooked. It's not about the drugs than it is the struggle, it's not about the violence than it is the real life struggle we dont realize in our suburban homes, its not about race more than it is about the relationships and how easy going we were to how bad it is now. Its honestly a time machine and peek back into our history not tainted by the news and real look at how we funded wars off the backs of our own.",/review/rw4347544/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2017,luvleme1,10," Quite Entertaining
","I LOVE this series. At first, I was disinterested in watching until I overheard a radio personality say it was a must- watch. After watching, I totally agree. This series is one of the best out now. It's one of those that keep you excited to see the next episode. Let's hope the nay-sayers don't discourage the series from reairing for other seasons. I love it and encouraged others to watch. Keep up writers, directors, whomever thought to put the info out. Its the truth!!!",/review/rw4347544/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2017,clydelouis,9," terrific reality
","I've watched two episodes so far and I have been blown away at how real and factual it has been based on what I've read in books about the beginnings of crack. The other reviewers that have given this poor ratings I think must be watching something else. With all the TV shows out there, this is by far above the rest in realism and ethnic relatable characters that don't come across as villains or heroes, just everyday people trying to make better lives for themselves that unfortunately choose bad paths.",/review/rw4347544/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2018,deloudelouvain,8," The story of the beginning of crack cocain
","I just finished watching the first season, just binge watched it. I already can't wait for the next season to come and I hope there will be much more seasons like this one. The story looks like it is taken from real life, a life of a young black entrepeneur in dope dealing, a guy that wants it all the easy way. Damson Idris did a good job playing this character. Along his way trying to get rich he discovers that there are many risks to be taken. A good story about the start of crack, the new drug then, a drug that will effect so many people badly over the next years. The cheap cocain for the poor people. A good story with unknown but good actors, good filming and soundtrack. What else could we ask more? Just many more seasons like this one.",/review/rw4347544/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2021,lu_lou_belle,6," Mediocre, could have been better
","Not breaking any new ground technically. Suffers from a lack of continuity in story and period setting. Having grown up in the era under the just say no, except when ollie and ricky dream up a what could go wrong scheme that destroyed cultures and killed millions, this could have been something. It's just not very ambitious. Not to mention, the art design has alot of anachronisms(21st century coifs for some, retro for others, same with clothing). It seems to borrow to the point of cliche from various movies and series that set richer more nuanced senses of place. Same problem seems to plague the acting, good cast but they're not really given much room to stretch in their roles. Cartoons of serious characters, and a lack of tension breaking humor..",/review/rw4347544/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2022,stephenkirby-38714,10," Hooked from the start 👌🏽
",Outstanding production. I loved the diversity of the characters and the build up to the characters also. This gave you time to enjoy their story's and time fall in love with them. Amazing show.,/review/rw4347544/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2018,opusv5,9," Particularly powerful
","I just watched season two's final episode last night and found it the strongest episode yet. Franklin's incarceration in the L.A. county jail (reportedly worse than prison) was believably scary, likewise the dangers and beatings he encountered in the detention centre. That he toughens up toward the end to retrieve his shoes and checkmate his enemies conforms with the character: strong when he has to be. The acting was uniformly excellent. The single weakness would be Franklin's release from jail: even if it happened, it couldn't be quickly. A DEA agent retracting their testimony would raise questions and cause delays.
I imagine there's a season three in the future. I'll watch it.",/review/rw4347544/?ref_=tt_urv

","An awesome TV show that caught my attention from the start. Set in the 80s culture and era, gives you that nostalgic feeling, if you're born and grew up in that era. If you enjoyed ""Narcos"" and ""Power"", you will LOVE this! ",/review/rw4347544/?ref_=tt_urv
