","I think this was the only Rocky film I never saw at the theater. I guess I'd had enough by then. However, I did catch this on VHS and, despite all the negative opinions I had read concerning it, I was glad I saw it. It was typical Rocky entertainment: hokey but satisfying and generally enjoyable.",/review/rw1022589/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2008,bluesman-20,10," Rocky V The measure of a man.
","Rocky V to me is the only Rocky movie that kept the promise and the original concept of Rocky. Rocky two three and four were great films but they moved Rocky too far away from who is was Rocky V fixes that problem. At the End of Rocky 4 we see Rocky is suffering from a Brain Truma inflicted from Drago's Blows Rocky is told he can never fight again and to do so would make him a vegetable. The Heavyweight Championship Title is stripped from him and Rocky announces his retirement. At the next moment he learns that his greedy lawyer has stolen Everything and Rocky is broke. He returns back to his old neighborhood and Rocky who was left Mickey's Gym reopens it and starts training a new generation of fighters Adrian goes back to work in the pet store and Rocky Junior must go to a public school where he must fight for his respect. Everything changes when Rocky is challenged by a dishonest promoter to fight the NEW Champion Union Kane Rocky refuses, At this time Rocky meets a fighter Tommy Gunn who wants him to train and manage him. Rocky begins to get his self respect back as his fighter wins fight after fight and attracts the new Champions attention. Rocky turns down the fight saying Tommy Gunn us not ready and Tommy turns on him. He becomes the Champion and the dishonest promoter becomes his mananger and he Confronts Rocky, A incredible Street Fight ensues and the movie winds down. This one is my favourite of all the Rocky films as it shows Rocky Down but not out. This movie has been unfairly knocked around by everyone from Stallone to the critics and yet it rings so true. Just try it you'll be surprised it's not your normal Rocky film it's better.",/review/rw1022589/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2012,ma-cortes,7," Acceptable follow-up in which Balboa is willing to risk his life against ingrate boxer
","Interesting sequel that works every time and in which beloved Balboa , the one time champion , returns to take on an ingrate contender performed by Tommy Morrison . Officially a sequel is most a rehash but happens to be a nice fifth chapter about Rocky saga with intimate Stallone . Two-bit fighter Rocky is now retired and has hit rock bottom , he lives from records but our hero returns as coach and to face off a daring contender . Reluctantly retired from boxing and back from riches to rags , Rocky takes on a new protégé who betrays him . As the champ's son must adjust to his family's new life on bankruptcy and being ostracized . Although he is homaged as one of the greatest boxing champions in the history also is panned as a down-and-out fighter , being nicknamed as the Chicken Stallion . But ¨The Italian Stallion¨ comes out from retirement for fame and self-respect to combat strongest, youngest and faster contender , despite his own cerebral damage , through a rematch on the streets . While Rocky attempts to prove himself and his family , his wife (Talia Shire), brother-in-law (Burt Young) and his teenager son (Sage Stallone , real-life son plays Rocky Jr).",/review/rw1022589/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2006,Cocacolaguy912-2,8," Surprisingly good.
","I thought Rocky V was supposed to be bad?! No no no! It is certainly different from the other 4 in that this time Rocky is retired and is working at Mickey's gym which he now owns...and looking after his son. Great, right? A father-son movie. But the wonderful thing is, it isn't drawn out with boring scenes of bonding and what not. This movie made me more angry than Rocky IV even. I won't say why for that would just ruin the fun part. This movie stays realistic to the character of Rocky, but this time it is more about his relationship not with himself but with the people around him. This movie is fun.",/review/rw1022589/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2012,classicsoncall,7," ""It don't hurt having an angel in your corner, you know.""
","Personally, extending the Rocky franchise beyond the first three movies was probably asking for trouble, but that could just be me. ""Rocky IV"" struck me as a quick way to make a buck with a series of cobbled together scenes from the first three films with a resounding sound track pumping up the volume. This one has a bit more of a plot to it, with the strained relationship between Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) and his son (real life son Sage Stallone) at the center of the story. It works up to a point, but by the time it develops into an alley fight between The Rock and his protégé Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison), all semblance of believability just melts away in a flash of fists and fury.",/review/rw1022589/?ref_=tt_urv

9 March 2009,jlivesay2010,8," This movie is really underrated
",This movie I know people did not really enjoy. But in a way it is underrated. Because it does really get Mickey back in the show (which Rocky IV stayed away from). I got sad towards the beginning when Rocky goes back to the old neighborhood one night and goes to Mickey's gym and at the end when Rocky is thinking back to what Mickey was telling him in the first two. It also really does have a father son theme in it. I felt sorry for his son. Tommy Morrison did a good job in playing his character. All the Rocky movies to me are the same because they all have there specialties. So yea in a way this movie is underrated and actually really sad.,/review/rw1022589/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2007,ackstasis,6," ""All those fighters you beat, you beat them with heart, not muscle. That's what Mickey knew; that's why Mickey and you were special.""
","Coming into the most lowest-regarded 'Rocky' sequel (amongst both critics and passionate fans of the series), I must admit that I felt a certain trepidation. Whilst I had enjoyed the wildly over-the-top shenanigans of 'Rocky IV,' it wasn't what you'd call a good film, and had simply become the clichéd story of a champion boxer's underdog victory, not making any attempts to expand on the character of Rocky Balboa or his relationship with family and friends. Rocky's fifth outing is generally considered to be considerably worse, frequently denounced by Stallone himself.",/review/rw1022589/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2002,Old Joe,," He is going back to where it all began. When you're down and out, the best shot is, simply, to  Go for it!
","When a doctor or a family member tells you that the only life you have ever know is over, that can be a pretty bitter pill too swallow. In Rocky V, Rocky Balboa is faced with such a scenario. This movie proves to me that you need to have more than one string to your arrow, as you never know when it might come in handy one day. Rocky V also points out that money and possession are not the important things in life, but family and (true) friends are!",/review/rw1022589/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2006,jonnyabomb,7," Give it a chance.
","For some reason or another, certain movies achieve a reputation as being worse than they actually are. Rocky V is one such film that is affected by the  as I call it  Phantom Menace syndrome. This refers to Movies that are interesting in their own way but fail to live up to the hype or expectation of previous instalments, or simply do not follow the formula that everyone derided for being too predictable anyway. For me, Rocky V is the best of the sequels to the 1976 original, as it does not follow in the Rocky tradition of simply having a bigger guy to fight than in the previous film. Rocky IV was a great spectacle but it was more comical than anything to think that an entire Russian government could be funding one over-sized boxer who could kill a man with one flurry of punches, not to mention turn a blind eye to illegal doping. The fifth instalment in the anthology goes back to the more personal story of the character, and deals much more realistically with the aftermath of loss and the twisted nature of professional prize fighting.",/review/rw1022589/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2017,Bored_Dragon,7," Refreshing change
","He finally gave up on four times repeated pattern and made a completely different story. This is not the story of a boxer who has to fight a bigger and bigger opponent in every sequel anymore, this is an emotional drama of a man who started from nothing, reached the stars and hit the bottom once again. A movie about being able to distinguish true values in life from current goals that blur the mind. The movie is not excellent in any aspect, but the story is the most interesting so far. Rocky's son is portrayed by Stallone's son, which gives this father-son relationship more credibility. Music is not bad, but it cannot be compared with prequels, except for fantastic ""The Measure of a Man"" by Alan Menken, performed by Elton John. Definitely worth watching.",/review/rw1022589/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2004,dr_foreman,," A step up for the series
","Often slated as the worst of the bunch, ""Rocky V"" is actually superior to the two films that preceded it.  Unlike the glossy third and fourth entries, this one tries to be down-to-earth.  Rocky loses his money, and is forced to go back to his old neighborhood.  Back in the grime of his past.  That's where he belongs, not in a mansion!",/review/rw1022589/?ref_=tt_urv

","Sometimes it gets annoying to me how critical people are of the Rocky series.

25 December 2016,jj0908,10," Most realistic Rocky since part 2
","You know why people don't like this movie? It's because it's gritty and depressing, it's real life! You take that many devastating blows to the head, you're gonna get brain damage. People were expecting another superhuman matchup when this movie came out, nope, just the consequence of his boxing career. Remember what the Russian did to Apollo? How on earth is Rocky supposed to come out unscathed?? Stallone was going for realism; irreversible brain damage. He got dumber than he was in part 1. But he still had heart, and that's what I loved about this movie. Part 6 of the Rocky series ignores this movie because of fan hate, that's sad. This was a great movie.",/review/rw1022589/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I was little I loved this movie. I later started to get negative though and hate it. I've changed now. I still think it is a good movie. So Rocky V wasn't the best. So Rocky doesn't fight in the ring. None of these things make Rocky V a bad movie. It has a great story, a great beginning and a great climactic fight. I wish other films can have as great a fight scene as the one in this one. The cool part is Tommy Gun is Tommy Morrison a real life boxer. I only wish I can see Rocky slug it out with another fighter like Mike Tyson or even fight The Rock.",/review/rw1022589/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2006,onehotmotherf,9," Highly under rated
","I felt the need to write something about this movie seeing the constant bashing it is taking, i'm a huge Stallone fan and an even bigger Rocky fan, People are rating this movie really bad, and i'm thinking are they getting the point? For me 3+4 were the most shallow movies if the series, don't get me wrong they are awesome films but they portray a more action oriented film, where as the first 2 were a good mix of drama and action, getting back to this movie, i feel this takes us back to roots of Rocky nice and dramatic with not so much commercialness in it as the previous 2, i love to see the old neighbourhood from the first 2 movies and how he fits back in with it, this film is about his struggle to deal with bankruptcy family issues and who he is. I think Stallone did a stellar job with this movie, the ending is superb and the soundtrack is nice and upbeat with the old classics in there too, Elton Johns ""Measure of a Man"" at the end for me really sums up Rocky's life and i love the captures playing through the end titles with it, as for the fight scene, classic in my eyes, through all the Rocky movies we here him coming from a street fighters background but we never see it until now.....the way he stares at Tommy and tells him to step outside really shows the animalistic streetfighter side of Rocky up until now we only heard about. I'm sorry if people don't agree with me but i think this film deserves much more praise than it receives, Hail Stallone Hail Rocky!",/review/rw1022589/?ref_=tt_urv

",This movie is very different than the others in the series but it is pretty good. If you liked the rest of the movies i would recommend this movie but if you have not seen the rest of them then do not see this one first. Although it is good it is not as good as the rest of them. We see Rocky's kid having a hard time in school so he want s to turn to fighting and the conflicts with that. This is all that i can really say without ruining the movie. Go for it if you liked the rest of the series. I didn't know what i was getting into when i rented this. I thought there was going to be more fighting in it. the final fight between rocky and the guy he was training is awesome. So it is good but not as strong as the rest of the series. 8 out of 10 This is my ranking of the series 1). Rocky 4 and Rocky 1 2). Eocky 3 3). Rocky 2 4). Rocky 5,/review/rw1022589/?ref_=tt_urv

","I had a really hard time last night where my life fell apart just like Rocky's, I watched this movie again for probably the 15th time but i hadn't seen it in about 8 years...today is a new day and watching this movie made the tears well up in my eyes...The story of a guy on top losing everything only to get back what's most important...his self worth and dignity and of course his honor...Great movie!! Great acting, remember folks this a Rocky movie, a boxing movie, an American Classic!! Thanks Sylvester Stallone your a true hero!! I could watch all his movies over and over, anytime. The cast members are all great actors and will always be remembered in the hearts of millions of fans around the world. I can't wait to see Creed as it looks to really rekindle the fire from previous installments of the series.

","Sly took a big chance with this one. After IV it was considered over, the Rocky saga ended with illustrious flag-waving camp and post-fight moronic platitudes about political allegiances. I will say though that I did like IV very much, the ending was just a little ridiculous though. Extending the Rocky tale meant an audience was going start off with one question- ""Now what?"" Rocky Balboa is hands down one of my favorite fictional heroes. He's likable, funny, strong, full of integrity. I really wanted to like this movie. It has problems, though, serious problems. First, the guy loses everything? All the money is gone and he's back on the street? That was a little hard to swallow. Next he decided to train some stalker and mold him into his own image to the detriment of his relationship with his only son? It was a little hard to grasp but I did see where he was going with that. Rocky knew he couldn't, or shouldn't, fight anymore so he lives vicariously and by extension through Tommy Gunn; with Rocky assuming himself as a young ""Mickey in the making"". It was alluring, to the exclusion of all else. But what I did find very appealing about this movie was the running commentary about the dark side of professional boxing. There was a reason he included a Don Kingish promoter to personify all that is seedy and wrong with the sport. You wanted to kill this guy by the end.",/review/rw1022589/?ref_=tt_urv
