30 May 2013,abeburnett,9," Exceptionally well-written, directed, and acted. VERY dark and scary
","This show, as many British shows, takes its time developing. It's not in a rush like American TV. ",/review/rw3598549/?ref_=tt_urv

30 August 2015,OGmacadamia39,2," Smart Serial Killer- Dumb Cops?
","OK- this show started out good and now, half way through the second season, seems to be declining fast. I mean case and point, the serial killer is sort of an idiot for telling his wife he slept with a 15yr old girl to create an alibi. I mean have a fake affair that's a fine cover, but don't set yourself up for divorce AND statutory rape. This guy is making mistakes left and right and yet the police are unable to anticipate or outmaneuver him. It's not like the killer has an extremely elaborate plan or is playing with them; no! He's horrible at what he's doing and the cops are still having trouble catching him. Hopeful but not holding my breath.",/review/rw3598549/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2018,mmmiiiaaauuu,7," third season changed my rating
","Everything in season 1 and 2 was brilliant, nice storyline, great acting, even with the cliches, I think it was well put together 
Season three.... here comes a spoiler!
Slow AF, looks like they tried to ""go inside the details"" but, it was just boring and pointless, honestly I started to get my closet in order while the season 3 was running, I just had this eternally feeling of wasting my time watching the pseudo-psicoanálisis of every moment of the previous seasons
The acting becomes so monotonous, slow, low voice, long pauses... It was a tough job staying awake, and even more, finishing this last pointless season, too bad, untill season 2, I´d given it 9 stars.",/review/rw3598549/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2013,macktan894,9," Excellent Combo of Prime Suspect & Red Riding Trilogy
","And note that both my nods to great crime thrillers were directed to British productions. The hunt for a serial killer gets a complicated but teeth-gnashing treatment in this beautifully produced series, The Fall. Gillian Anderson plays Stella Gibson, a focused, rather humorless, detective who takes control of the investigation once she ascertains that recent murders are indeed the work on one killer. She doesn't have to fight the battles that plagued Jane Tennyson, however. The male officers pretty much cede control and follow her lead & respect her authority and insight. But she is like Tennyson in that she's sacrificed the personal for the professional, indulging in the occasional ""sweet night"" to satisfy her sexual desires. ",/review/rw3598549/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2021,kosmasp,9," The Fall (from Grace?)
","What a powerhouse performance by Gillian Anderson ... this is a murder case, a detective story ... but it also is about feminism in a way. Now you may roll your eyes (or applaud), depending on how or what that word does to you. But while other movies may really use a too obvious way to hammer home certain social/gender issues, this really tackles it all with the right amount of self awareness! The main character is not without flaws ... but no hero is perfect, no matter if male or female.",/review/rw3598549/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2013,c-kelsall,9," The best psychological thriller I've seen in ages
","This series had me gripped from start to finish, and I couldn't be happier that a second series has been green-lit. As a senior police officer leads the hunt for a serial killer in Belfast, we see the similarities in these two amoral protagonists. The story unfolds with an economy of scene structure which never omits important details; every scene drives the narrative, but it never feels unreal or stretches credulity. Beautifully paced, tension abounds with spine-tingling murder scenes. The characters are very well written, and played with pitch-perfect performances from the leads, Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan. Another reviewer on this strand didn't like the ending, but for me it was spot on. The story took the time to include complexities and unresolved events which are reflective of real life. Are we to castigate every TV show production team who leave a show on a cliffhanger ending to give them somewhere to go with the next series? If the next one carries the universally excellent production values of the first, then I for one can't wait.",/review/rw3598549/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2016,beamerportia,2," Third season not worth the wait....may contain spoilers.
","Loved first season, tolerated second season, disliked third season. Just did not understand the third season's total lack of attention to security of a serial killer. This was even after his confessions and after he led the authorities to where he was holding his latest kidnapped victim. Basically he was left in his hospital bed unguarded and unrestrained. His nurse (who resembled all his victims) was in charge of the alleged serial killer and she became very protective of him, seriously? Of course she also was ""under his spell"". Plus his latest kidnap victim is also in the hospital unguarded and in his adjoining hospital room. It was so ridiculous that it became a comedy of errors....and eventually I started rooting for the serial killer!! I watched the last two episodes of the third season mostly on fast forward. Ugh.",/review/rw3598549/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2020,lil_mizz_nics,7," Unfortunately series 3 happened.
",Well I was gripped in series 1 & 2 and watched it in two days. Couldn't get enough 10/10 it was gripping. Then unfortunately series 3 happened. And literally NOTHING HAPPENED. What a waste of my time. I'm actually half watching the final episode of series 3 as I write this and I'm almost asleep. It's incredibly slow and pointless and huge details I found annoying such as having the killer pretty much on the same room as the victim in the hospital. Unguarded. Seriously?,/review/rw3598549/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2013,dikaea,9," Realistic and to the bone
","""The Fall"" is a very well filmed and developed story. The acting of all the cast is accurate and right where it needs to be. No more, no less. ",/review/rw3598549/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2016,whatithinkis,7," For about three episodes
","I thought Season 3 was awful. I have finished Season 3 and I am more than satisfied with the ending. SPOILER ALERT . . . I'd grown so disgusted with Gibson allowing herself to get sucked in by the psychopath, sobbing because he might die. It was embarrassing.",/review/rw3598549/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2016,allievan,6," What happened to security ????? Spoiler Alert
","Love the show, but I don't think the writers are making these first new episodes in season 3 credible. Why no armed guards with Spector ? Why is Rose Stag not in a private room under guard ? Why would the they assign a nurse that resembles Spector's victims ? I do hate when they do that !!!! Stella is great as usual, thanks to Gillian Anderson's superb acting, but we need to get out of the hospital now. The writers seemed to have dropped the ball a bit so far, however, I will stay with it on the strength of Stella. I owe her that. I have marked this down from 9/10 for seasons 1 & 2. I do hope the momentum picks up as this progresses as this usually is a gripping drama.",/review/rw3598549/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2015,xhidden99,5," Gave up after S2E1
","Life is too short to indulge this new genre of TV in the style of The Killing where nothing happens, no one talks, there's virtually no plot, no suspense, no tension and strangely, for a police show, no actual police work. It's a 'thing' now called Slow TV. I didn't know it was a thing until I started reading the reviews of this, The Klling, Above the Lake, Peaky Blinders and other shows. The reviewers kept coming around to slowness and inactivity as a dazzling new thing not a defect. Like they all loved shaky cam for years and until every movie was a camera tied to a monkey on meth. We can call this KTV where the K is for Ketamine or Klonopin. Anyway as to The Fall it's a straightforward story of tough cop chasing madman but they took that story and wrapped it in hour after hour of mood and atmospherics. I put in 5 hrs of S1 and 1hr of S2 and stopped because another 5 hrs I could have watched my fireplace or caught up on reading. I could put that book down every 45 minutes pay attention for 5 minutes and be all caught up. Maybe that's the intent of KTV; background noise you sort of watch 5% of the time. Give it the briefest of your attention it won't matter. Morally ambiguous good will defeat morally ambiguous evil and so forth.",/review/rw3598549/?ref_=tt_urv

3 June 2017,Kirpianuscus,," ordinary people
","one of series who are, in profound sense, special. or different. or unexpected. or great. or surprising. because it is not exactly the crime series who could be familiar. it is not the psychological drama who propose mysteries and solutions and brave heroes. it is a gray story about ordinary people, in a Belfast who has the chance to be any town. a precise picture, almost too neutral, about vulnerable people, about a case and about a hunt with double sense. and this small facts transforms it in a admirable work. because it has the chance to be a trip among cold slices of reality.",/review/rw3598549/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2013,hastonlowman,9," A Very Intelligent and well written thriller!!
","Gillian Anderson is an excellent choice as lead detective in this series about her pursuit of a serial killer. The show also follows the life of the serial killer giving the audience an inside look that is rare and quite similar to Hannibal, but less dramatic in a good way. Ironically Gillian Anderson also has a prominent role in Hannibal as his personal Psychiatrist. I wish there were more shows like this on television, but I fear that the average person is more drawn to less sophisticated programming. At times it seems a bit slow, but the characters are so interesting it really doesn't bother me at all. I have yet to notice any glaring wholes in the writing and quite honestly the filming and cinematography is excellent! I pray this show is on for many more seasons to come, often though it is this type of show with all its perfection that gets cut short... let's keep our fingers crossed... they did at least get a 2nd Season.",/review/rw3598549/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2017,rraa-dd,2," Woeful
","Gillian Anderson has got to be portraying the most irritating, bland, shallow, dislikeable and frankly dumb main protagonist I have ever seen in a series. The constant whispering and a never-changing facial expression are just pathetic and whilst I realise she is meant to portray a 'cold' character, it is definitely over done.",/review/rw3598549/?ref_=tt_urv

","Really fuming, I didn't read the synopsis for season two or three because I didn't want to spoil it. But after episode 7 they're no closer to catching Spector I did look and it goes right to the end of season three. 17 hours of film for one story. War and peace was shorter. I really did think that each season there would be another killer. Really peed off at this and have abandoned mid season two as can't bear this creep Spector for another 9 hours. Good grief Anderson go back to the x files",/review/rw3598549/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2019,PFFAW,1," Really, really bad, and Gillian Anderson is profoundly annoying
","This is just really bad. I only watched it because a guy I'm dating wanted me to watch it. Relies upon every worn-out trope in the genre, using torture and murder as titillation, completely shifts gears to mimic ER halfway through, and then there's Gillian Anderson. Her character is offensive, but she's just downright annoying on top of it. Ugh. Don't waste your time. I'm dumping the guy.",/review/rw3598549/?ref_=tt_urv

","Jamie Dornan and Gillian Anderson perform a wonderful tango to the end. The writing of this series never disappoints. The entire cast are excellent. The art direction, lighting and soundtrack are flawless. Then we get Krister Henriksson, the Swedish ""Wallander"", as a forensic psychiatrist. Mind-blowing.
