","First, all the negative reviews seemed to only watched one episode.",/review/rw8627439/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,Ginrosie,10," Not just a chick flick series
","My first compliment is for the actors! Finally, a show that uses authentic foreign characters playing the foreign parts...perfect example are the couple that play Lino's parents. True Italians speaking southern Italian along with the with the mannerisms and sayings true to the region.... Having Italian parents myself, this so refreshing to see and hear this, so much better than using actors speaking with an exaggerated corny accent. On to the series itself, what a roller coaster of themes and emotions: laughs, tears, family and marriage drama, forgiveness, loss, reconnection, acceptance, romance, inter-racial relationships, heart break and devastation. It is a series I will recommend to others and think about for a long time to come.",/review/rw8627439/?ref_=tt_urv

26 October 2022,tinapatel-62210,10," Incredible Acting
","The acting was incredible - simply incredible - each and every actor in this show was amazing and brought so much depth to their characters. I binged the entire mini-series in a few nights, and by the last moment, I was ugly crying. I haven't cried this hard in a long time. This was a love story that shows you how to love, compromise, appreciate, respect, communicate. I loved the cultural nuances, the dreams that had to change, the realities of life, the complexities of families and choices. This is the best love story I have seen since 'The Notebook.' My husband isn't a fan of romantic movies; however, he was glued to the story as much as I was and appreciated it. It's a must watch.",/review/rw8627439/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2022,wonderstone_entertainment,9," Music is the main character in this limited series, and I absolutely love her!
","Wrapped in life stories merged in love, tradition, hope and pain there are unforgettable characters within this series that move a soul with every line, every facial expression, and every heartfelt embrace. I consider Music to be the main character pressing all others into my heart and mind. Then, of course, there is Zoe and Eugenio, the obvious lovers that live out their days testing the strength of that love. They certainly made and impression on me. But, perhaps, the characters that grabbed my attention the most while viewing the series was Kellita Smith-an actress who, in my opinion, has finally found a platform worthy of her comedic timing, and then there is the ever versatile, undeniably talented Danielle Deadwyler--an actress who often transforms herself into drastically different roles, where she could easily be nearly any and every black woman or black man who's dead or alive. Without pause, I'm always anchored in the natural talent and brilliant line delivery of Keith David and Judith Scott, and in this series their performances did just what I expected; they kept me grounded in all that's good. Topped off with the talented Paride and Lucia, and directed by a Nzingha Stewart, this series is full of character that will never die.",/review/rw8627439/?ref_=tt_urv

",Just knowing it was based on a true story made it touching from the get go.,/review/rw8627439/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2022,ladydoodlebop,8," Not what I was expecting, but beautifully done
","I don't want to post any spoilers, but I wonder what's with all the people giving it poor ratings for only bother to watch one or two episodes.",/review/rw8627439/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2022,aayatmahdi,10," Absolutely heart-wrenching
","The first couple of episodes and also the trailer might make it seem like a basic movie with the same old story much like Netflix's recent ""Love in the Villa"" but it was nothing sort of that!",/review/rw8627439/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2022,slrussell1908,10," A True Love Story
","From Scratch is a true story based off the book From Scratch: A Memoir of Love, Sicily and Finding Home by Tembi Locke. This movie is a warm captivating love story of cross-culturals set in a beautiful Sicilian countryside.",/review/rw8627439/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,Becks26,9," Beautiful and heartwrenching
",This is one of the best series I have watched in ages. Also the one I have cried the most to!,/review/rw8627439/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2022,Canada777,10," Well done!
","This limited series is so refreshing with a African-American lead actress, an Italian lead actor, which was long overdue in mainstream productions by the USA/Netflix. There should be more lifelong or long lasting multi-ethnic marriages made into both TV and films portrayed like this! Beautiful job by all of the acting and crew staff -- all of it!! This limited series is romantic, amazing chemistry and affection, passionate, sexy, funny, moving, heartbreaking, heart aching (go through an entire box of tissues sobbing cathartic), restorative healing with resounding love, and love of blended multicultural family--well done!! Brava & bravo!! And the scene with Lino and his dad after many years making talking & starting to make peace in the hospital made me cry so hard and miss my late father even more- I cried and laughed so much at the end of that scene. Best and most moving mini series I've seen in years-- heads up #Emmys & #AcademyAwards- all around for this!!",/review/rw8627439/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2022,mvp-73,8," E1-3/4 is 2*, E4-8 is 9*
","This is a difficult review. Love Italy, know Florence and Sicily, as well as the US, love family dramas, good food and art and thought this would easily be a 10/10 for me. Yet I had to force myself through e1-4 (mid e4 got better) because it felt unreal, I couldn't connect with any character and I was bored to death. The only reason I didn't give up is because in THEORY, I should have loved it. Well, during Episodes 4/5-8 it all came together for me. Finally it seemed real, it made me smile, laugh, cry. Not going to spoil it, just saying that what happened was portrayed realistically and in the end love, in its many forms, is all that matters. I will watch this again and see how I feel about e1-4.",/review/rw8627439/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2022,zinnymarshall,10," Rollercoaster of Emotions
","I don't know where to start from but I can say for sure that this series is a hell of emotions. The love story was romantic, the passion was felt and sadness was deep it was like it all happened to me in one seating. I practically bawled my eyes through the pathetic parts. Lino's and Amy's love story is highly relatable and the series of trials the passed through to be where they are is highly commendable. I for one will say that the writers of this movie did a hell of a job and they actors brought it to life by nailing everything on point, it goes to show that family is everything in every situation. They are there to be a backbone when needed. This is a series worth watching words can't describe ,best believe that it embodies everything you can think of. A Movie Never To Be Forgotten.",/review/rw8627439/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2022,hawkinsuhc,9," I'm not a crybaby but......
","This movie, series, almost perfect! It had a beginning, a middle and an end. It actually makes you believe in true love. I loved Lino and Amy's ""story"". I love how their commitment and love for one another was able to solidify their families. I loved how they never wavered no matter what was thrown at them. Even when you were sitting up there watching, and maybe about to cry or crying or just feeling so devastated for the characters, because this movie made you feel everything, they found a way to lighten it up so you could breathe just a little. So you could smile and suck up some of those tears for just a little bit. Had the movie remembered all the pictures she took, and had some kind of homage to their story at the end, it would have been perfect. Nevertheless, a lovely story.",/review/rw8627439/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2022,dbuckshnis,9," Texas vs Italy - so empowering
","It's so fascinating this dichotomy of the marriage of an America verses a foreigner. Gently but also in your face as the story handles the big ""Texan and black"" aspect with the lovely Sicilian.",/review/rw8627439/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2022,sofia-nk,10," It just gave me all the feels
","Do me a favor and WATCH IT! Believe when I say you won't regret it. The last time that I cried watching something related to entertainment was when Hatchi, the movie, came out. Now this series, as well as the book, it gave me ALL the feels. I read the original book (which is an amazing story to read if you're a bookworm), and you can see the essence of the original story take place perfectly here; from the representation of Italian culture to what it means to be loved by someone. Loved the series as much as the book. This series, unlike many other shows and movies, it shows you what it means to be truly loved by your partner; it shows you that it means constant support & respect from one another in one's dreams. It means that where there is peace & happiness, there's true love. There needs to be more visual stories like this.",/review/rw8627439/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2022,KATO-SUBZERO,10," Beautiful Interracial Love Story
","Sunday 23 October 2022: I am a strong supporter of All Interracial Love stories between men and women and this one starring pretty and talented African Dominican Latina actress, Zoe Salda√±a in the role of Amy is excellent from start to finish. This story also sort of mirrors Zoe's real life. Her husband Marco Perego is Italian and grew up in Italy, so in hearing her speak basic Italian probably came easy for her.",/review/rw8627439/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2022,bunnysboxis,9," Get through the 1st episode in order to appreciate the whole thing
","I feel that the character development and the formation of the relationship between Lino and Amy in the 1st episode could have been better. Once you look past that, you can really become invested in the lives and relationship between Lino and Amy through their love and devotion to each other and the trials and tribulations they have to endure as well as the happiness and hope for their future. Ended up practically binge watching this series, I really tried to watch it all in one night (because I was hooked) but couldn't. Ended up watching the last 2 episodes as soon as I woke up at 6am and ended up bawling my eyes out. Brava Zoe and Eugenio!!!",/review/rw8627439/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2022,vycktory,9," For my helpless romantic
","I was intrigued by the trailer it immediately began watching. I was instantly enthralled by this by this cloying romantic drama but captivated by its charm. I love the theme and all the characters. I was surprised by the melancholic turn of events. In the end I was glad to see people overcome their prejudice, culture, and even ignorance, realizing that life is brief and that we all want to feel connected. Embracing love helps us cross the barriers, realizing we are mor alike than different. It definitely made this black woman want to visit Italy to taste the cuisine, experience the culture, and see the beautiful landscape.",/review/rw8627439/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've only just completed the series but my heart has been shattered into a million pieces. Beautifully written and beautifully portrayed.

28 October 2022,brandimullin-68217,10," Beautiful story about love and challenges in a relationship
","Each episode was beautifully written and really put each relationship into perspective and how the relationships progressed. The events they both went through with love, family, life, heartache was understandably clear and the acting was just amazing. The layers and all the emotions in the show is incredibly beautiful and heart wrenching. An uplifting romance about true love with unimaginable obstacles.",/review/rw8627439/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2022,lauragarciamarketing,10," It was worth many awards
","Zoe & Eugenio's interpretation was amazing. My husband and I were watching it together. We are a mix couple from two different cultures. This show made us feel a lot of emotions. It was incredibly well done and they couldn't pick better actors. Their love story feels so real. It tells you that love can endure the hardest things in life. I love how supportive both of their family's are. I love how they support each other and how they decide not to quit on each other's even when things got tough. I love how her sister makes her laugh in the toughest moments of her life. I love the cultural differences that they embrace together. We laughed, we cried, and we remembered that we are really grateful that God put us together. Thank you for this amazing show. I 100% recommend it!!",/review/rw8627439/?ref_=tt_urv

","I settled on my sofa on Sunday to kills some time and clicked on From Scratch. I fully expected to breeze through a couple of episodes.. OMG was I ever wrong.

22 October 2022,room-41203,10," Great movie
","Great movie. Excellent tour of Florence. Great dialogue. I recommend this movie. Funny and great music. Not a typical love story. Original and moving story. Even though the music is Italian, still very beautiful music. I can't wait to see the next episode. Not a typical hallmark love story. Passion and true adult meeting and falling in love. The actors and actresses are great and believable. Sad it is only 8 episodes. If you plan on visiting Florence, watch this series, it shows the beauty of Florence. If you are looking for a different and real love story, look no more, this is the answer. Watch this.",/review/rw8627439/?ref_=tt_urv
