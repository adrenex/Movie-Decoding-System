19 July 2007,ccthemovieman-1,8," Funny For Those Who Like Absurd Humor
","This has to be a movie that people would either laugh their butt off watching, or turn it off and never finishing it because it was so stupid. Fortunately, as someone who loves absurd humor, I was entertained by it. Yes, it's one of the dumbest films you'll ever see, but it's supposed to be stupid, a satire on the shallow people and world of male fashion models.",/review/rw0645970/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2022,johnnybravoctk,10," One of the funniest and quotable movies of all time that I have no clue how it's rated this low.
","Only a 6.5 for one of the best comedies ever!? Come on that's ridiculous. To this day, it still creates enormous amounts of memes. Anything that does that, you know is a classic.",/review/rw0645970/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2002,ken_gewertz,," An absurd but smart send-up of our image-obsessed culture
","Released a few short weeks after Sept. 11, Zoolander became the target of ""this is why they hate us"" diatribes. I didn't see it until months later and immediately recognized what I can only hope I would have seen if I had watched it earlier--that this is a superb satire/farce.  There aren't many movies that manage to be both silly and smart at the same time, and this is one. It is not only a send-up of the modeling and fashion industries, admittedly easy targets, but of our whole image-obsessed culture which commodifies love, spirituality, patriotism, heroism just as easily and unthinkingly as it does kitchen appliances. This is not a ""stupid"" movie, even though it is about stupid people and stupid situations. It keeps the targets of its satire within its sights at every moment, never letting that focus flag to pursue maudlin subplots, but at the same time, it is unfailingly hilarious, with marvelous comic acting, sight-gags, sets, and costumes. The screen is just packed with visual jokes at almost every moment. This is not a movie that anyone needs to be embarrassed to watch or enjoy. But it is also just plain damned fun!",/review/rw0645970/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2004,erialc0,," A Classic of the Idiot Genre
","Since Zoolander was released, I think I can safely say that it's become one of the most popular dumb comedies of the past ten years (a decade that was all too saturated with dumb comedies). Maybe it's the tongue-in-cheek attitude, or the clever writing, or the fact that it's immensely quotable (""I'm pretty sure there's more to life than being really, really, ridiculously good looking""). But whatever it is, it makes for a terrifically fun movie.",/review/rw0645970/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2004,silentcheesedude,9," A hilarious 'poke' at the fashion industry
","When Zoolander came out, I remember big deal plugs that were made for this film by the media. The movie, after all, is poking fun at entertainment, in particular, the fashion and model industry. This was a hilarious take on it, and Zoolander, our main character, is stupidly lovable. Ben Stiller proves once again his flexibility with his comedic acting. Just watch 'Meet the Parents'and this, you'll think it's 2 different actors. Showing you how much work Ben can do, he also helped write and produce the movie. Owen Wilson usually ends up in a movie with Ben, and he's hilarious too. And of course Will Ferrell is always a riot. Read the Plot Outline in the details, there's not much to it. But you don't watch movies like this for incredible story lines, do you?",/review/rw0645970/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2001,gregherk,8," Zoolander is stupid funny!
","Derek Zoolander is stupid. So is his movie. But by no means, is Zoolander humorless. Directed by and starring Ben Stiller, Zoolander is a very funny movie, if you know what to expect. Based on a character that Stiller created for the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards, Derek Zoolander was originally intended to satirize the fashion industry. The movie does no less and as a result, has received some very negative patron reviews. Audiences went into Zoolander expecting another Ben Stiller, Meet the Parents-type comedy, and when they got an offbeat movie about the fashion industry's plot to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia, they didn't know how to react. To enjoy Zoolander, one has to forget all expectations and see the movie for what it is supposed to be: ridiculous.",/review/rw0645970/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2010,napierslogs,7," ""Zoolander"" is stupid in every way
","""Zoolander"" is stupid, but it's stupid in every way: its characters, its plot, and its jokes, but that starts adding up to fun. I will admit that I laugh most times I watch it, sometimes I groan because of the stupidity, but I usually have a smile on my face.",/review/rw0645970/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2001,synefra,9," The previews didn't lie, you get what you see.
","I gave this movie a 9/10 for this reason, if you have seen the previews, you know what you are going to see. You are going to see a movie that is exactly the kind of humor that the preview TELLS and SHOWS you it contains. They don't expect Oscars, and arent even trying for them. This movie is not to be taken seriously, its for FUN, people. The movie's main characters did great jobs, and had good charisma between them, there were tons of other actors putting in small bits (some of which were amazingly funny, I laughed out loud in a few parts, and I almost never do that). There were some truly funny moments, moments I found much funnier than I thought the film would be. When I told friends and family I saw it they all said, `You did?' when I said I liked it they said with even more incredulity, `You did?!' because I don't like certain kinds of stupid humor. I liked the Three Amigos, but hated Austin Powers. Potty humor doesn't do it for me. But this movie was surprisingly witty and funny without thinking it had to be disgusting to be humorous. There were a few parts I could have lived without, gladly, but overall you get what you think you are going to get, and more!",/review/rw0645970/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2017,Screen_Blitz,7," Zoolander is funny enough to excuse for how spectacularly goofy it gets
","Ben Stiller is the titular character of this comedy that does not believe in being particularly smart. It is dumb, but with such infectious comedic energy by Stiller and friend Owen Wilson poured on screen, it is funny enough to look past how ridiculous it gets. Stiller, also filling in the director's chair, conducts a comedy that lends a satirical look at the modeling industry and how competition can bring out both the best and the worst in those who compete for the big prize. This is where the small, but significant amount of cleverness comes into the picture. But it is Stiller and Wilson are smoke the air with their comedic energy to make this into a film that offers just enough laughs and fun to compensate for its short runtime. While it certainly isn't consistently funny, with occasional botched attempts at humor, it knows how to tickle the funny bone for a film that resists against engaging the brain. This film follows acclaimed fashion model Derek Zoolander (played by Ben Stiller), a three-time consecutive award winner who is on his way to claiming his fourth prize as ""Model of The Year"". All this hopes are eventually crushed when the prize goes to his rival Hansel (played by Owen Wilson). To make matters worse, he find himself on the cover of a magazine mocked as an ""idiot"" by columnist Matilda (played by Christine Taylor). Throwing in the towel, Zoolander decides to pursue on a new path, possibly opening up an institute for children who have trouble reading. His goals are soon put a halt by dubious fashion designer Mugatu (played by Will Ferrell) who uses a machine to brainwash him into killing the prime minister of Malaysia as an outcry against child labor. With this mind out of whack, you must turn to Matilda and form a bond with his rival Hansel to help from committing this diabolical plot. ",/review/rw0645970/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2022,benjaminwest-242,7," A good comedy
","Zoolander is an entertaining, albeit flawed movie. What works best is the consistently funny comedy that stems from such a fantastically unique premise. The film is entirely satirical and its comments on the fashion industry are all hilarious, even providing some important themes because of it. There are many highly quotable lines, too. The delivery of these lines produce even more laughs, especially coming from the awesomely ridiculous acts of Stiller, Wilson, and Ferrell. Each of these actors give stellar performances that distinctly characterize their roles. The dynamic between all the characters and especially Stiller and Wilson are fun to watch, therefore. The romance with Taylor is somewhat weak, but her overall act and character do compliment the plot decently well. However, the many cameos throughout are largely distracting and do not work into the plot. Various moments feel weakly written, then, in addition to the notable plot holes present. This being said, the overarching villain scheme is effective and provides for a solidly intriguing, humorous third act. The resolution is largely satisfactory, too. Overall, Zoolander is a fun comedy and absolutely worthwhile.",/review/rw0645970/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2012,CinefanR,10," Very intelligent movie about stupidity
","Not a favorite on the first viewing, when it premiered, this movie is - I have to admit it now - hysterical. Don't forget that it's a parody, it's quirky, completely ridiculous, insane & over the top and yes, people in it act stupidly. I'm not a fan of Ben Stiller, I haven't enjoyed any other movies of his, but this is spot on. I say justice has been done: it's been finally revealed that stupidity knows no gender when it comes to the fashion world, and it comes in epic proportions. ",/review/rw0645970/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2012,bkoganbing,7," Stiller Family Production
","I see that another Zoolander film is in the works right now with Ben Stiller repeating his character of the brain dead male model. As it's been over a decade I hope that his character ages properly with the time. His career as the 'it' boy of the fashion industry should be over by now, but no reason he can't have a son breaking into the business.",/review/rw0645970/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2002,dtb,8," AUSTIN Posers--Hip, Daffy, Yet Kinda Sweet
","In Entertainment Weekly, Ben Stiller described this feature-length adventure of the moronic male model he created for the VH1 Fashion Awards as ""MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE meets EYES OF LAURA MARS."" Me, I can sum it up in two words:  ""AUSTIN Posers.""  No, better yet, I'll boil it down to one word: ""endearing.""  That's right, endearing!  As lighthearted as it is lightheaded, this daffy spoof of conspiracy thrillers and the mad, mod world of male models and other hipsters has a surprising undercurrent of sweetness to it. Star/director/co-writer/co-producer Stiller plays dopey Derek Zoolander as a gentle, essentially kind-hearted naif under his hip veneer. The same is true of Owen Wilson, putting his twang and quirky humor to good use as Derek's rustic yet hippy-dippy rival-turned-ally Hansel. I suspect folks will like ZOOLANDER even better on DVD, since there are tons of hilarious extended scenes and deleted scenes as well as the original Zoolander TV sketches that Stiller & Co. did for VH1. As Derek says in the voiceover intros on the DVD menu, the ZOOLANDER disc is a wonderful introduction to ""the world of DiviDuh""! :-)",/review/rw0645970/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2005,dangermouselor,10," Gets better each time I watch it
",A really great take on the modelling world. Each Time I watch it I see something else that makes me howl with laughter. Out of all the Stiller/Wilson collaborations this is definitely the funniest. There is so much going on in the film and I love the way all the celebs join in on the joke.

29 December 2016,planktonrules,7," Silly and good for a few laughs.
","If you are looking for a cerebral comedy, you certainly should not pick ""Zoolander"". It's dumb, rather silly and...dumb. But, it's also good for a few laughs and is a very amiable time-passer filled with lots of amazing cameos.",/review/rw0645970/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2002,sittler,," Stiller and Wilson are great together
","A hilarious, ridiculous comedy that does a great job of poking fun at celebrity. Ben Stiller seems to think that fame is rather silly and he shows his contempt for it in the form of male super-model Derek Zoolander.  The intellect-challenged, self-absorbed Zoolander pouts, struts and mispronounces wonderfully throughout this comedy that's aimed at being stupid.",/review/rw0645970/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2001,jhclues,10," Ben Stiller Delivers A Classic Comedy
","The complex world of the male modeling profession, including the inherent rivalries and the significant impact the industry has had on history is explored and revealed in `Zoolander,' a brilliant comedy directed by and starring the versatile Ben Stiller.  With chiseled features that bespeak the best of Michelangelo, as well as an arsenal of three `looks,' preeminent of which is the riveting `Blue Steel,' Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is poised to win the coveted VH-1 Male Model of the Year Award for an unprecedented fourth year in a row.  But this year-- for the first time-- he has a rival, a newcomer, who just may be able to usurp his title:  the charismatic and popular Hansel (Owen Wilson), who-- with chiseled features of his own-- has burst upon the scene only this year and threatens to steal Zoolander's thunder in one fell swoop.  And as if this wasn't enough for the seemingly (until now) invulnerable Zoolander to have on his vapid mind, a reporter for Time Magazine, Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor-- Stiller's real-life wife), has written an in-depth article about him in which the true nature of the man behind the Adonis is objectively and succinctly revealed, and it's scheduled to hit the streets the week of the Awards.  Suffice to say it's a full plate for Derek Zoolander, male model, who-- unbeknownst to him-- has yet an even greater personal vexation awaiting, which involves a sinister plot and the Prime Minister of Malaysia.  The Prime Minister of Malaysia? And what-- you may ask-- does that have to do with the male modeling profession?  Well, it's just that kind of movie...",/review/rw0645970/?ref_=tt_urv

","Derek Zoolander is the top male model, a position he has held for many years but things look tight with the rising talents of Hansel McDonald. Faced with competition the likes of which he has never faced before, Derek becomes open to suggestion and willing to take actions beyond his normal realms.

14 May 2012,drqshadow-reviews,9," Brilliantly Stupid Satirical Comedy - One of Stiller's Best
","On the surface this looks like the stupidest comedy ever conceived, but in actuality it's... well, actually it's every bit as dumb as it seems, but it's also inconceivably hilarious. Loaded up with eyeball-rolling gags and perfectly-timed celebrity cameos, it's overstuffed with stream-of-consciousness satire and the very best veins of Ben Stiller's unchained sense of humor. Stiller's ironic crosshairs wave all over the place, landing precise jabs at society, fashion, politics and celebrity while still finding time to keep the ridiculous primary narrative in motion. Owen Wilson is flawless as Zoolander's flaky new-wave rival Hansel (he's so hot right now) and Will Ferrell makes the most of a criminally-brief amount of screen time in his own inimitable way. I was blown away by how creatively funny this was the first time I sat down with it, and I'm equally amazed with how well it's held up over the ensuing eleven years. The laughs simply do not stop coming.",/review/rw0645970/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," Essentially just one long joke: our hero is stupid.
","'Zoolander (2001)' has its fair share of funny moments but it's essentially just one long, sort of uninspired joke: our protagonist is a male model and is 'therefore' stupid. That's not to say that the two identifiers are intrinsically linked, rather that the film seems to tie them together - perhaps unwittingly - in a way that almost seems mean-spirited, or at least approaching that. This is through omission as opposed to inclusion, necessarily, but it still stands out as an issue considering that every male model character is also portrayed as, shall we say, less than intelligent. This definitely becomes played-out pretty quickly considering that the gags all stem from this, the film's apparent core principle and, as I mentioned, only real, reoccurring joke (or at least the basis for it). Neither of the main issues I've mentioned, not the near mean-spirit nor lack of innovation, are helped by the fact that the main supporting player is portrayed as being just as comically ""bone-headed"" as our hero; this doesn't provide a good foil for (or contrast to) our lead and it definitely doesn't help with the film's stereotyping problem. It's not like there isn't any enjoyment to be had and, like I mentioned, there are a few laughs here and there. However, a lack of originality does seep in pretty quickly and the picture isn't all that compelling in general. 6/10",/review/rw0645970/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2015,anaconda-40658,7," The New Austin Powers.
","Zoolander (2001): Dir: Ben Stiller / Cast: Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Christine Taylor, Will Ferrell, Milla Jovovich: Ben Stiller plays supermodel Derek Zoolander who is the best in the business with his latest fashion called Magnum. He is on top of his game until Hanszel wins male model of the year. Now they are engaged in a bitter feud, which involves a competition where they both yank their underwear out of their pants. Enter Christine Taylor who is attempting to uncover an assassination plot where male models are brainwashed into committing the crime. This all climaxes with extreme stupidity but Stiller succeeds in creating a film that is far different than his Reality Bites with obvious inspiration of Austin Powers. It is obvious that he researched his subject matter and took aim at the sometimes pompus world of the fame seeking. Stiller as Zoolander seeks appreciation from his father as well as retain his public dignity. Owen Wilson steals his spotlight as Hanszel. Taylor is a mere prop with hinted romantic intentions. Will Ferrell is hilarious as the villain with outrageous hair. Milla Jovovich plays Ferrell's evil henchwoman, which is just as well since she has done the Resident Evil films. The climax is sidelined by numbing violence meant for humor but is merely just corny. Good concept satires the world of modeling with colorful production but it still wallows in stupidity.
