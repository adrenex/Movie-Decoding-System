18 December 2006,Danusha_Goska,8," If You've Ever Been Poor, This Movie May Be Hard to Watch
","If you've ever been poor, this movie may be hard to watch. It depicts poverty in America in gut wrenchingly accurate ways. I've been as poor as Chris Gardner, and, like him, I've been poor among very rich people in the Bay Area while trying to work my way up.",/review/rw1798517/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2012,planktonrules,9," Exceptionally painful to watch but Will Smith's performance is very, very nice.
","""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is one of the more painful to watch films I have ever seen. Now I am NOT saying it's a bad film--but it's very hard watching the main character, as his life is an absolute mess and you really want to see him succeed in spite of a horrible series of downturns.",/review/rw1798517/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2008,bob the moo,," Almost too heartbreaking to be uplifting even if it ultimately does it, but still engaging and driven by another very good performance from Will Smith
","Chris Gardner is a struggling salesman who finds himself having to look after his son when his wife gives up and leaves him. Using his charm as much as his academic record, Chris wins his way onto an internship programme of twenty, with only one job at the end. He has the determination to make it but with no salary and almost no income from his sales efforts, Chris finds himself homeless and increasingly desperate as he tries to keep up with his peers by day and survive the rest of the time.",/review/rw1798517/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2009,blanche-2,8," Never give up
","A father and salesman is in ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" in this 2006 film starring Will Smith, Thandie Newton, and Jaden Smith. This is the real-life story of Chris Gardner, who was eking out a living selling bone density scanners while his wife (Newton) worked double shifts at a hospital. They weren't making it financially. One day Gardner sees a man get out of fancy car and asks him how he made it. The man says he's a stockbroker. Chris applies to the Dean Witter Reynolds apprentice program, unaware that there's no salary. He gets in by being terribly persistent. Then his wife leaves him, and Chris insists that their son (Jaden Smith) be left with him.",/review/rw1798517/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Best movie ever. recommend 100%
","In this journey through the struggles and trials that single father, Chris Gardner, has to take, you see the real side of hardwork and integrity. Chris Gardner, played by Will Smith, Is just trying to give his son a good home as he's on the pursuit of happiness. This movie doesn't only show the hard work of a single parent, but it shows that no matter how hard you get pushed down, you should always get up and keep going. I love the strong connection that the father and son roles have in this movie, it seems so real, and that's because it is! The father (Will smith) and son (Jaden Smith) are father and son outside the movie realm too. Actor, Will Smith, shows his true emotional side during this film, as if he was actually going through the situations occurring in the movie. There couldn't have been a better cast picked for this movie, the pain, struggle, love, and hope seem so real as if you're watching a documentary on someone's life. Smith, usually looked at as a comedic actor, shows what he can really do by jerking the tears from the audience's eyes.",/review/rw1798517/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2007,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," I'm still wiping the tears from my eyes
","I was so hesitant to see The Pursuit of Happiness for one reason, this movie looked like an incredible tear jerker, just from the trailer I was nearly crying. But my friend and I had been hearing incredible reviews about this movie, so we decided to suck it up and see the movie today and we were just blown away by how amazing Will Smith's performance was. He and his son were just so incredibly heart warming and really reminded you of the important things in life. I was so touched by Chris's story, he was so determined, this movie makes you wanna go out and achieve your dreams and to never let anyone tell you what is right and what is wrong, what you can and cannot do.",/review/rw1798517/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2006,nwsurfrider,9," Great performances, inspiring story
","I was involved with one of the first test audiences almost a year ago, and came away quite impressed with the acting performances and heartfelt punch of Pursuit of Happiness. This is easily one of Smith's best films, as he pours his heart and soul into the main character. While the plot may remain a bit transparent, it leaves you asking the question of yourself - how long would you keep battling to get what you really want out of life? I plan on seeing the film again when it releases to the general public, and am very interested to see what changes were made after running it through the test screenings. As I saw it then, it needed very few, if any, changes.",/review/rw1798517/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2013,AgentDice,9," You got a dream... You gotta protect it. People can't do somethin' themselves, they wanna tell you you can't do it. If you want somethin', go get it.
","No one would make a movie about a guy struggling to succeed who doesn't ultimately succeed. Certainly, no one would make a Will Smith movie about a guy who breaks under the strain of his difficult life, abandons his child and dies. That's just not going to happen. And because we know that -- because we've seen more than one movie in our lives -- ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" has a particular challenge: To take the real-life rags-to-riches story of stockbroker Chris Gardner, a story with a preordained happy ending, and imbue it with tension and suspense.",/review/rw1798517/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2006,lisa_ann_sanders,10," Meaningful and Uplifting
","My husband and I had an opportunity to attend a screener of this movie last night. We had seen several commercials and a trailer for the film and we had high hopes, we were not disappointed. Many times ""inspired by"" films feel like hard sells or bids for Oscar glory. ""Pursuit of Happiness"" is none of that. This is an honest, meaningful film that will stay with you long after you leave the theatre. The viewer becomes fully invested in the struggles of Chris Gardner and his son. Will and Jadyn Smith deserve huge kudos. The real-life father and son dynamic enriched the film and don't know if other actors could have been as powerful. Be warned, there are several tissue inducing moments. This movie is well worth a ticket!",/review/rw1798517/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2007,claudio_carvalho,8," A Touching Story of Perseverance, Commitment and Objective in Life
","In 1981, in San Francisco, the smart salesman and family man Chris Gardner (Will Smith) invested the family savings in Ostelo National bone-density scanners, an apparatus twice more expensive than x-ray with practically the same resolution. The white elephant financially breaks the family, bringing troubles to the relationship with his wife that leaves him and moves to New York. Without money and wife, but totally committed with his son Christopher (Jaden Smith), Chris sees the chance to fight for a stockbroker internship position at Dean Witter, disputing for one career in the end of six months training period without any salary with other twenty candidates. Meanwhile, homeless, he has all sorts of difficulties with his son.",/review/rw1798517/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2006,roachG-1,9," Will Smith is Oscar-worthy, no doubt about it.
","Here's the deal: It's real, it's heavy, and it's inspirational, but NOT AT ALL cheesy. Don't like that? Don't see it. I won't say much else. I will say that Will Smith was shockingly good now that he's paid his dues with ""Men in Black"" and ""Bad Boys.""",/review/rw1798517/?ref_=tt_urv

30 November 2006,thinkr,8," Take your parents to see it over the holidays
","I was fortunate to see this movie in a screening. I really enjoyed it, and felt that it lived up to the teary and heartwarming trailer. While the movie has an uplifting ""go for your dreams"" message, the deepest theme is that of family.",/review/rw1798517/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2006,jellienellie818,10," Amazing!
","I have been a fan of Will Smith for years and I have to say this may be his best film yet! ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is just a wonderful (based on a true) story, full of adventure, hope, and pain. I saw the movie last night in a packed theater. Big Willie Weekend has returned, and for good reason! It's a great movie to see during the holidays and definitely a tear-jerker! Perfect for a date, a night out with friends, or even with family. If you ever thought Will Smith really couldn't act (and shame on you!), you'll think otherwise once you see this movie. You can really feel what he's going through just by looking in his eyes. And Jaden Smith is too adorable! Their on screen chemistry is almost unbearable to watch! Go see this movie! Great acting, great directing, great writing...you won't regret it!",/review/rw1798517/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2006,Godsmack04,10," Amazing
","This is one of the best films of this year. For a year that was fueled by controversy and crap, it was nice to finally see a film that had a true heart to it. From the opening scene to the end, I was so moved by the love that Will Smith has for his son. Basically, if you see this movie and walk out of it feeling nothing, there is something that is very wrong with you. Loved this movie, it's the perfect movie to end the year with. The best part was after the movie, my friends and I all got up and realized that this movie had actually made the four of us tear up! It's an amazing film and if Will Smith doesn't get at least an Oscar Nom, then the Oscars will just suck. In fact Will Smith should actually just win an Oscar for this role.!!! I loved this movie!!!! Everybody needs to see especially the people in this world that take everything for granted, watch this movie, it will change you!",/review/rw1798517/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2007,christian123,5," Despite featuring a few heartwarming moments and fine performances, the film was uninteresting and forgettable
","Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is the type of guy everyone knows and most have been at one point in their life or another - the working poor. He's smart and diligent but unable to catch a break and falling further and further behind in his responsibilities to everything except his young son (Jaden Smith) whom he'd promised to always be around for, no matter the circumstances.",/review/rw1798517/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2007,Hitchcoc,8," Much More Than I Expected.
","Seeing the pain in Will Smith as he jockeys for position in a dead-end world is certainly worth the price of admission. This is the tale of a man who has been dealt a bad hand by life, but has never had the courage to start over. He goes from hospital to clinic, trying to sell a bone density scanner that really offers little new to the science of diagnosis. When he ends up as sole support of his little boy, he must change his life. He has seen the happy faces of stock brokers leaving their jobs with smiles on their faces, he decides this is what he would like to do. He has an amazing mind for mathematics and feels he can parlay this gift into a career. The problem is he must continue to eat and find a place to live. There are times when things get maudlin and a bit far fetched, but it does grab at the heartstrings and does present a man who faces off against forces we've all dealt with. It's an unfair world and the haves really become obvious to the have-nots. ",/review/rw1798517/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2007,Quinoa_Chris_Kirk,2," The Pursuit of Capitalysm
","""Happiness"" is equated with being a successful capitalist. The film is as narrow-minded as its protagonist. Why is life so extraordinarily difficult? This is is not explored. Are there other alternatives to the life he has chosen? Not at all. Will Smith's performance is the only thing holding this tacky film together. He is a two-dimensional man in a one-dimensional world. Remove the cohesion of his performance and the film becomes a series of set-pieces on overcoming adversity. The film is called The Pursuit of Happiness when what he is actually pursuing is a job, which in the film brings him nothing but misery and difficulty. The misspelling of ""happyness"" comes from a mural on his son's kindergarten wall. Ironically, the only thing resembling ""happyness"" in the film is the man's relationship with his son, which is strong and intimate throughout, not something he really needs to pursue. Are the filmmakers aware of this irony? It seems unlikely, considering the film's thesis is: work incomprehensibly hard and maybe you will get a job in which you have to work equally hard for the rest of your life. The perfect anti-capitalist weapon for those able to stand outside of the film's emotional manipulation. For those who buy the emotion wholesale, they are given no reason to do other than continue their pursuit of happiness without actually being able to enjoy it. Because life doesn't have a ""happily ever after"".",/review/rw1798517/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2007,dfranzen70,4," Sad, in the unfortunate, crappy way
","There are undoubtedly two camps of people who watched this film: those who start to tear up at the very hint of a Very Special Movie, and those who rely a little on logic and, I dunno, sense; those who, that is, want the movie to work a little to earn tears, not the other way around.",/review/rw1798517/?ref_=tt_urv
