30 March 2019,andrewchristianjr,9," ALL TIME FAVE DISASTER MOVIE.
","I don't get it why this film just got 6.4, maann the visual effect alone was amazing. The tension is so high especially the new york scene. Maybe the science isnt accurate but I found this film is very entertaining. I watched this when I was 9 or 10 yo, now I'm 24 and this film still my fave disaster movie. The tsunami, tornado etc was perfect. Good job for the writers, director, producer especially the cast.",/review/rw7849374/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2019,acedj,8," Come on people.
","How many times do I need to read other's reviews on disaster films before I remember most people on here writing these think they are actual film critics? It is a disaster movie. Yes, the science is terrible. Yes the coincidences are fantastical. If you watch these for ground breaking stories with rich plots, or for an Oscar worthy performance by one of the actors, then you are watching these for the wrong damn reasons.
This movie shows a future where due to the rise in global temperatures, a modern ice age is triggered. How it is ushered in is by these violent, giant hurricane-like storms that cause flash freezing, and bring in a myriad of disasters with them. These include tsunamis and blizzards that drop so many feet of snow that people are walking level with the signs on the interstate that you would normally drive under. It also tries to throw in a lot of relatable human elements, such as the struggle of a man that is an absentee parent because of his job, trying to connect with his son, a lonely boy dying of cancer, and just the human death that this kind of disaster would bring.
Do not watch this for the science, though I do feel that they had the causation of another ice age correct. Do not watch this for deep plot. Watch this for the enjoyable ride on which it takes you.",/review/rw7849374/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2021,nathanmanson,8," Why the hell is this a 6.4
","I am absolutely baffled at this being only a 6.4. I literally had such little hopes for this then I was super surprised. I thought the special effects were actually really good to say it came out in 2004. I was happy to see Jake gyllenhaal smashing it from a young age. It was so sad when that guy cut his rope to fall to his death, I don't mind sad things happening in films because it's making you feel something. I thought the film so good the ending must be horrendous because of the rating but again I was wrong even the ending was good. All round great film screw all the bad reviews they know nothing about films.",/review/rw7849374/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2021,Calicodreamin,8," Lower Manhattan is INACCESSIBLE
","One of my all favorite time disaster movies! It's got the right mix of over the top weather moments, dramatic storylines, and Dennis Quaid. Endlessly rewatchable and surprisingly heartfelt.",/review/rw7849374/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2019,UniqueParticle,10," I am the only person on earth that loves ""The Day After Tomorrow""
","I have seen this movie so many times in the last 15 years and still relish it for what it is! I really enjoy a lot of the scenes and story. I'm blown out of the water that a bunch of reviews were bashing the script and story, really unfortunate. I got silly thoughts like I'd like to see anyone of you make a movie script lol it's cool though I have fun! Very cool to see the storms and all the smart people gather to talk about everything, I love all of it!",/review/rw7849374/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2004,bob the moo,," Clich√©d, illogical, unscientific but the first hour really delivers even if the second hour is like the 1970's never happened
","After years of warning about global warning, Jack Hall is horrified to find all his predictions coming true much faster than he could have imagined. Hail stones the size of footballs decimate cities, typhoons destroy Los Angeles and New York becomes flooded. As the big freeze crosses the northern hemisphere, a small group of survivors try to fend off the cold as the world prepares for a dramatic change in the world order.",/review/rw7849374/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2009,TheLittleSongbird,7," Spectacular special effects, uneven film
","The Day After Tomorrow is not a bad movie by all means. In fact, it's an uneven but decent film. The film does start off absolutely brilliantly, with a wonderful idea for a story and truly spectacular special effects. As a matter of fact, the whole film is well worth watching for the special effects alone. The acting is not too bad; Jake Gyllanhaal is rather bland, but Dennis Quaid is a superb lead. Plus Emmy Rosum looks positively radiant and Ian Holm is as reliable as ever. The direction from Roland Emmerich was surprisingly good, there have been times when I have found his direction too murky and unfocused, but no it was above decent here.",/review/rw7849374/?ref_=tt_urv

","Yes yes, plot holes blah blah, this movie is so fun to watch if you don't pretend you're a know-it-all scientist.
If you are a a scientist, it's probably not for you.",/review/rw7849374/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2021,sjanders-86430,10," Roland Emmerich directed
",Dennis Quaid is Jake Gillenhaal's father. The set up start shows a crack the size of Rhode Island that cuts off ice into the oceans. That amount of ice changes the currents which change the warmth to freezing in North America and Europe. Tornadoes rip up Los Angeles. The ocean plows down the streets of New York City. Quaid must rescue his son Gillenhaal at the New Youk City Library where books are burned to keep warm. Quaid gets as far as Philadelphia from D. C. He and one other walk to New York.,/review/rw7849374/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2006,ccthemovieman-1,8," Ridiculous Story, But Fun To Watch
","I was leery of a heavy propaganda piece on ""global warming,"" but I still saw this and found that, yeah that's what it was but it was really more of just a straight adventure story than anything else.....and not a bad one, at that. The first 50 minutes of this two-hour film have the ""fun parts"" where the special-effects dominate. We see all kinds of radical weather disasters that are extremely dramatic and entertaining to watch, even if they don't make a bit of sense.",/review/rw7849374/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2004,BaronBl00d,8," Oh! The Weather Outside Is Frightful...
","I really enjoyed this film by director Roland Emmerich a great deal. It is a fast-paced, exciting, suspenseful film filled with wonderful images, great CGI effects, plausible acting, and even a coherent script. How realistic is it? I hope not at all, but the director made the film so that it seems very real and like something that MIGHT happen. The story revolves around some major climatic shifts that cause the entire Northern hemisphere to become Artic tundra. New York City is devastated as are other major cities all over Europe. Dennis Quaid gives a good performance as a climatologist that predicted some of these events. We see things through his perspective and that of his son for much of the movie. The acting in general is good in this film. I particularly liked Ian Holm's role as the British meteorologist stuck in the middle of nowhere while these changes advanced. Much of the credit for the film's success must go to Emmerich. This is easily one of his best films. He keeps his viewer on the edge of his/her seat through the entire film. Action is the film's primary objective, but Emmerich also uses a lot of humanity in what his character's motivations are, and I for one, enjoyed seeing that side of humanity rather than what I probably would see under similar circumstances. As a previous viewer noted, this is a great popcorn movie!",/review/rw7849374/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2004,Victor Field,," It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel okay.
","""The Day After Tomorrow"" is a disaster movie, but it isn't a disastrous one. But if Roland Emmerich really thought he was making a movie with a message, he didn't quite succeed - to be honest, Emmerich is to serious film-making as Naomi Wolf is to recommending ""Voluptuous"" magazine. The fact that the movie begins with the Twentieth Century Fox logo under stormy skies doesn't make it any more significant.",/review/rw7849374/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2019,zenmateisshite,9," Stood the test of time
","The main argument for those who do not like this movie is that its not scientifically accurate. Is Nolan's Interstellar scientifically accurate? Is Kubrick's 2001 accurate? Even the most accurate Sci-fi, Contact, is not that accurate.",/review/rw7849374/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2021,eva3si0n,8," Welcome it one of the best movies of catastrophes
","Welcome it one of the best movies of catastrophes. There is no plot irritating with dullness as it is absent especially also. All movie upon cutting an action scenes. Yes 14 years of the schedule later doesn't impress any more, but it is still interesting to look at it. The main thing in the movie - in him everything appears in time, there is no circuity of action.",/review/rw7849374/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2017,NateWatchesCoolMovies,," One of the last great disaster flicks
","Roland Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow is one of those textbook disaster flicks where every recognizable element is in full swing: determined scientist, sure of his curveball theories that no one else buys, saddled with a dysfunctional family and a clock that's quickly ticking down towards some looming cataclysm, in this case severely bat tempered weather. It's cliche after cliche, but this is one of the ones that works, and I have a theory why. These days it seems like the formula for the disaster film is pretty dead, or at least doesn't carry the same magic it did throughout the 90's and early 00's.",/review/rw7849374/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2007,bkoganbing,7," A Plea For Kyoto
","I'm certainly in no position to comment on the science put forth in this film. When I was going to school, I remember being taught in science class that the Ice Age was a gradual process that took place over thousands of years and then it took thousands again to reverse it. Of course we didn't have man around using all the planet's resources for industry. ",/review/rw7849374/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2020,thewhitehydrangea,8," Definitely not scientifically accurate but I love it anyway
",Honestly I love this movie. No matter what I'm doing if I see this on tv I go ahead and grab a drink and put my feet up. Don't watch this expecting realism. Just watch it for what it is - a disaster movie that suspends reality and science to reunite a father and his son during the storm of the ages.,/review/rw7849374/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Day After Tomorrow. The future that no one expected. Not strong in geology and other sciences, but I will say that the film was shot amazingly!

30 April 2020,maue-19674,7," An enjoyable 'Disaster' Film with some nice set pieces
","This Film harkens back to the old 70's Disaster flicks - taking situations and just magnifying them 1000 fold for entertainment sake. Yes, the Science here is questionable (apart from the effects of the currents being disrupted!) - it is all in the service of a storyline. The weather systems across the entire Planet are thrown into chaos by 'climate change' and it is up to Paleo-climatologist Dennis Quaid to convince all that the unthinkable is going to happen - while at the same time trying to re-bond with his estranged son - Jake Gyllenhal. All of this is hardly new but this Film does it with great dash and with a few great set pieces - the inundation of New York is superbly done and the characters are allowed to develop in quite a natural way. Unlike many of Emmerich's film (which I find overblown) this one he approaches in a more serious manner - the opening shots of Antarctica set the scene extremely well and the accompanying score by Harold Kloser is actually very haunting. All in all, an enjoyable film with some very nice performances.",/review/rw7849374/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2022,planktonrules,4," Total nonsense that really looks nice.
","I agree with the review I read on IMDB that said the film is cliched and illogical...but the special effects and catastrophe that happens in the first hour make it worth seeing. I also agree with them, however, that the last half just looks like a survival film...like Irwin Allen's ""The Poseidon Adventure"" or ""The Towering Inferno"". This is especially because any pretense at making the story plausible seems to have vanished! So, New York City has zero power and has been innundated with walls of water...so why are the cell phones and pay phones STILL working? And, only a couple days after,it's so cold and frozen that wolves are running about NYC eating folks?? Huh? It just seemed like after a while, the writers were tossing anything into the mix...and I'm surprised they didn't introduce aliens like the Great Gazoo or Uncle Martin!",/review/rw7849374/?ref_=tt_urv
