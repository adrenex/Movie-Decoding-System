11 February 2018,gogoschka-1,8," The Most Underrated Of Cyberpunk Noirs
","Probably one of the best big-budget sci-fi films to never reach a big audience. Written and produced by James Cameron and expertly directed by Kathryn Bigelow, this film is more noir than actual sci-fi - although the sci-fi elements are important. With a great cast and an amazing atmosphere throughout, this is one not to miss for fans of thrillers, film noir, sci-fi and especially the subgenre knwon as cyberbunk. 8 stars out of 10.",/review/rw1010685/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2003,barnabyrudge,," Terrific science fiction offering.
","Strange Days is a truly astonishing science fiction offering, part scripted by James Cameron and directed with relentless panache by maverick lady-director Kathryn Bigelow. It presents a depressing and bleak, yet worryingly probable, view of the near future, and hooks its story threads upon the impending millennium eve celebrations. Although December 31st, 1999, has been and gone since the making of this movie, it is a credit to the makers that this film still offers a plausible viewpoint about where the world might be at in the next decade or so.",/review/rw1010685/?ref_=tt_urv

24 August 2018,tdh_fbi,8," One of the best (and also most underappreciated) films of the 90's
","""Strange Days"" is a unique science fiction and mystery film. Set in Los Angeles during the last two or so days prior to the new millennium, the cast is helmed by Ralph Fiennes as the charming, brave, but shady Lenny Nero. Lenny is a former LAPD officer who loses his job for mostly unknown reasons. He then becomes a black market hustler who sells people's recorded memories for profit. For the most part, these recorded memories are either violent or sexual in nature.",/review/rw1010685/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2001,DJ Inferno,," One of my all time faves!
","Unfortunately, this film failed at the box-offices, although it´s one of the greatest masterpieces of the 90s. The first time I saw ""Strange Days"" was about five years ago, and then over and over again. If you think Ralph Fiennes is only able to play sensitive and problematic characters watch this: it´s his most unusual, but one of the best performances in his career - a performance of a coolness you only would expect from Samuel L. Jackson. Angela Bassett is one of the toughest women cinema has ever seen and Juliette Lewis, Tom Sizemore, Glenn Plummer, William Fichtner - every single role is casted perfectly...",/review/rw1010685/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 1999,The_Core,10," Sizzling Sci-Fi/Action Thriller
","""Strange Days"" literally has something for everyone.  Science fiction, violence, peace, romance, comedy, tragedy, action, you name it -- it's in this film, and it's done with class and intelligence.  I agree that this one is destined to become a cult classic.  However, be prepared for one of the edgiest, most violent and emotionally exhausting films you've ever seen (the first three minutes of the film make it very clear what you can expect from the rest).  There are at least five climactic scenes toward the end, which must break some kind of record.  After the movie's over, you may feel like you've just been cooked in a vat of boiling oil... but luckily, you'll be perfectly well-done, not burned to a crisp.  10/10.",/review/rw1010685/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2018,classicsoncall,7," ""It's pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex!""
","With SQUIB (Super Conducting Quantum Interface Device), we have a heightened version of virtual reality in which the wearer of the unit experiences pleasure or pain as if he were taking part in the scene he's witnessing. The images presented are from real life rather than simulated, and often create a visceral response in the participant, which is one of the reasons the technology has gone black market. The stuff Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) deals in goes by the name of 'wire tripping', somewhat of a misnomer unless you consider the makeup of the headpiece worn by the user.",/review/rw1010685/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2009,funkyfry,4," Ugh
","There are some promising aspects to the set-up and the plot, but it doesn't hold up for the entire film. The whole big revelation at the end is not a worthy compensation and much too obvious. Fiennes' character work is fine but the way the character is written makes him generically likable in a Spielberg kind of way and it put me off. Fiennes and Bassett just do not have any chemistry; I appreciate that it was pretty daring for them to have an inter-racial leading couple, but these particular actors didn't have it together. Bassett is one of those characters created in a petri dish by action movie screenwriters -- the single mom who takes care of her family and is also an expert at martial arts and killing people.",/review/rw1010685/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2021,killercharm,7," Delightful
","The movie that a opened my eyes to Ralph Feinnes's comedic genius. Didn't care for him much before this flick. It's got a wonderful vibe to it, this movie does, this great near-future street mood. It is a little destroyed by some of the wincingly bad hipster drug outlaw lingo, but, well Ralph is such a good sniveling junkie that...what's not to love. A former cop who had a life has now lost everything because he has become a dealer of black market addictive films in which images are fed directly into the brains of the audience directly from the subject's own brain, conveying emotion awa image. A new technology that has become the illicit drug of choice.",/review/rw1010685/?ref_=tt_urv

","In 1999, Los Angeles is racial war zone with the army and LSPD and SWAT officers fighting Afro-American people. The former cop Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) is a dealer of illegal recording in CDs that gives the memories and sensations of the recorder to the user. He buys the recordings from the supplier Tick; he misses his former mistress Faith (Juliette Lewis), who was a hooker and now is a singer; his best friend is the private eye Max Peltier (Tom Sizemore) and the limousine driver Lornette 'Mace' Mason (Angela Bassett), who has unrequited love for him. Two days before the turn of the century, the black rapper Jeriko One (Glenn Plummer) is murdered. The hooker Iris (Brigitte Bako) seeks Lenny out but there is an incident and they do not talk to each other. However she drops a recording into Lenny's car while he unsuccessfully tries to meet Faith at a night-club. However her boyfriend Philo Gant (Michael Wincott) does not let them talk. When Lenny learns that Iris was sadistically raped and killed, he gets involved in a sick scheme and discovers dirty hidden secrets. ",/review/rw1010685/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2000,diffusionx,7," Engaging, but Uneven
","Strange Days is an interesting film, with a great premise. It also happens to be well-executed, for the most part. The LA of the future (well, future back when it was released in 1995) is quite dystopian in nature, and Strange Days manages to present all facets of that using Taxi Driver-influenced car rides through the city while observing the chaos on the streets. In many ways, Strange Days manages to create a real-life and convincing future, and it feels like a true place, with things going on independently of the events in the movie, rather than feeling like a movie set.

","Bombastic assault on the senses disguised as a ""brainy"" sci-fi action film. Set in 1999, the film follows former cop turned fast-talking street hustler Ralph Fiennes, who specializes in selling disks containing the memories and emotions of people, which is apparently the drug du jour. When he stumbles on a disk containing the murder of a prostitute, he becomes embroiled in a police conspiracy, rape, murder and assorted sordid elements in order to rescue former girlfriend Juliette Lewis from peril.",/review/rw1010685/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2007,masterjk2,2," Strange Period
","If this wasn't one of the worst SF movies ever made, please send me the names of ones that were worse. I'll avoid them assiduously. The plot, if you want to call it that, involves our hero, Feinnes, running around madly from party to party, getting thrown out of one place just to go back and get thrown out again. If you haven't figured out ""who done it"" within a half an hour, try something a little less complicated, say Little Red Riding hood. The premise that by slapping on the mind meld machine, usually worn under a wig, is promising. Have an orgasm, vicariously. Why not? But the plot abuses the idea to the point it becomes ludicrous, along with the acting, which is at all times, ludicrous, except for Angela Bassett. She acts her heart out trying to make this laughable movie work. To no avail. The continuity is nonexistent. In the final scenes, people are beaten, stabbed, shot and go on like little has happened. A good part of the movie is spent driving around in a Taurus limo. You know that car's gong to get blown up for sure. Who would use such a car unless they were on the cheap and didn't want to blow up a Caddy or Lincoln. Juliette Lewis,the temptress, attempts to be seductive as she sings, but it's more a tribal squat than a sexual gyration. Mr Feinnes, normally a fine actor, just looks either pained or pathetic as he tries to make us believe he's having an epiphany while wearing the brain beanie. Of course, it's hard to look post apocalyptic in 1995, when making a movie about 1999. We know what happened the night ushering in 2000. Nothing much. They have tired crews in the street, waiting for riots. The same poor people in the streets day after day. D'Onofrio's death scene was totally unbelievable, but that fit in. This thing dragged on for 2 1/2 hours. There wasn't enough substance for 30 minutes. Looking for a late night movie to put you to sleep? This will do the trick.",/review/rw1010685/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2000,inframan,1," A truly awful movie!!!
","This is a classic example of the worst kind of mindless hollywood drek. Director Bigelow shows little talent for much other than glittering car chases & stock wide-screen ultra-violence. Anyone who can get such a cheesy imitation of James Woods from a fine actor like Fiennes deserves some sort of booby award. She's certainly no friend to women or blacks, either. She seems to want to use the LA cops vs African-Americans issue as a theme here, but her blacks are some of the worst stereotypes (all negative) since the 30s. The plot sucks big-time, the costumes & attitudes are incredibly dated (this movie is only 5 years old? It looks & sounds like it was made in the 70s). Woof, what a dog! (Sorry, Rover.)",/review/rw1010685/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2016,PredragReviews,8," Compares Favorably with ""Blade Runner""
","""Strange Days"" is a movie that has a bit of everything and ends up being a terrific cinematic experience. Set in a near future, the story deals with classic themes like virtual reality, thought control or the share of memory, providing and exciting and engaging cyberpunk adventure. Director Kathryn Bigelow creates a futuristic LA that manages to be both sophisticated and believable, avoiding the over-the-top, Utopian and not very realistic depictions of future societies presented in other sci-fi films. Although ""Strange Days"" is basically a thriller, it is way above many run-of-the-mill movies of its genre, as it succeeds at combining its key elements perfectly. The direction is dynamic, unique and fast-paced, adding style and energy with an excellent sense of rhythm, flow and tension. The acting is also a plus, since Ralph Fiennes is unforgettable as the flawed anti-hero Lenny and Angela Basset shines as his sister-in-arms Mace. This duo makes for an odd, yet original and memorable couple, delivering some enticing and moving scenes. It's also interesting seeing the female character protecting the male for a change, making for a clever reverse of the predictable and typical scenario of most action flicks. Juliette Lewis is also convincing as the dark and feral femme-fatal, especially when she sings a P.J. Harvey song to perfection (one of the many excellent and remarkable moments of this movie).",/review/rw1010685/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2002,Emerenciano,4," Too damn long!
","Sometimes I think I know nothing about cinema. I just can't understand how such a bad movie can be so admired by people all around the world. Apart from the good initial idea, the film brings us nothing but a strong will to go to bed and fall asleep. I must confess I had to sit on my bed not to sleep with the TV on. I think the good cast, that counts on Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Lewis, was the reason that made me fight the will to sleep. There are also quite few good action scenes, but they are nothing really new. Such I simple plot could be shown in about 100 minutes I think. Two hours and a half is too much!!. In the last 20 minutes we can clearly see that scenes are added to the film just to give it a flavour of a great production, and that isn't good. It just makes people be tired of watching nothing. The last scenes are just ridiculous.",/review/rw1010685/?ref_=tt_urv

","`Strange Days', one of many films made in the mid- to late-1990s that chose to dabble in `the near future of the year 2000', not only still looks good in the year 2001, but holds its own as a darn good film.   A mix of `Blade Runner' film noir and uncomfortable realism, `Strange Days' has the audacity to tackle some disturbing topics and to actually tell an interesting tale in the process.",/review/rw1010685/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2005,MovieAddict2016,5," A waste of space
","I don't like Bigelow's films. She is like her ex-husband, James Cameron, in terms of action; only Cameron knows how to complement action with a clever storyline (""T1""), human conflict (""T2"" and even ""Titanic"" to some extent), and humor (""True Lies""). Bigelow does not. Her films are rarely good. (""Point Break"" was intolerable.) So, ""Strange Days"" is similarly an awful waste. It's supposed to be a satire but it's so excessive and over-the-top and crazy that it's hard to take seriously. I did enjoy certain parts, but overall felt it was a waste. The satire is too obvious -- ooh, drugs are addictive and bad for you and technology is going to be our next fix, wow, I didn't see THAT coming! And talking about seeing things coming - how's the ending for you? It turns an otherwise fairly entertaining no-brainer into a stupid, contrived, totally predictable slasher flick in which the bad guy can never seem to die, and keeps getting up for more.",/review/rw1010685/?ref_=tt_urv
