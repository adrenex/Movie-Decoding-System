17 July 2015,shawneofthedead,7," Formulaic but entertaining, in its own way, with an excellent cast doing excellent work.
","There's got to be something magical at work here. Strictly speaking, there isn't a shred of anything remotely original in Southpaw's DNA. Boil the narrative down to its bare bones, and it's a tried-and-tested, tried-and-tired retread of the sports movie. It's not even metaphorically about getting back up after life knocks you down - that's literally the plot of the film. And yet, through Antoine Fuqua's sensitive direction, Kurt Sutter's punchy dialogue and some excellent performances, Southpaw somehow transcends its own generic limitations.",/review/rw7933951/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2015,JoaoPovoaMarinheiro,8," Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is a southpaw that goes straight to the heart
","We can always criticize Hollywood for bringing movies that are intended to toss some smoke to the viewer by presenting something new with repeated formulas and recycled plots we have seen somewhere else before. The same goes for ""Southpaw""... apart from the fact that there's something more lying inside this story about a boxer's redemption. The answer to it is the trust it puts into the strength of its actors and the gripping emotions that come with it.",/review/rw7933951/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2015,3xHCCH,8," Gyllenhaal the Great
","Billy Hope is the light heavyweight champion of the world with a 43-0 record. One day, as a result of his uncontrollable violent temper, tragedy after tragedy hits him and his family until he is left with nothing -- not his fortune, not his career, not his family. Despondent and desperate to get his life back, Billy swallows his pride and seeks the assistance of trainer Tick Wills to train him back to fighting form.",/review/rw7933951/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2021,planktonrules,9," Jake Gyllenhaal, once again, takes a risk.
","Jake Gyllenhaal is an incredible actor and I don't think there's another actor today who takes the risks and plays the wide variety of roles that he plays. And, in ""Southpaw"", he once again REALLY stretches his acting skills and he turns in an amazing performance.",/review/rw7933951/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2015,condillon,," Coming from a formulaic genre, Southpaw is a bit clich√© but it surely brings powerful performances and a promising storyline
","Southpaw follows Billy ""The Great"" Hope, the reigning junior middleweight boxing champion, having an impressive career, a loving wife and daughter, and a lavish lifestyle. However, when tragedy strikes, Billy hits rock bottom, losing his family, house and manager. He soon finds an unlikely savior in Tick Willis, a former fighter who trains the city's toughest boxers. With his future on the line, Hope fights to reclaim the trust of those he loves the most.",/review/rw7933951/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2019,jespor,8," Jake Gyllenhaal deserves at least a nomination
",Wow. This is actually an incredible movie in which Gyllenhaal delivers an Oscar worthy performance.,/review/rw7933951/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Great
","The first 45 minutes are basically Murphy's law for the protagonist: everything that can go wrong, will go wrong. But you it's also true that when you've hit rock bottom, the only way is up. What follows still isn't predictable here, but takes a lot of effort, sweat and tears. Once the film is over, you realize it played you with the conventions of the sports drama you've seen a few times before. But while you're in it, you're on the edge of the seat and feel for this deeply flawed man and his adorable daughter. That's no small feat. Director Fuqua could rely on an incredibly strong cast, especially Gyllenhaal, delivering one of the best performances of his career.",/review/rw7933951/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2015,DrZom-77-388656,5," You have seen this movie before
","I guess there is just no new way of telling this story. A boxer on top of his world loses everything in the blink of an eye, then battles his way back. Every trite plot wrinkle is there. Every sympathy trigger is there. The writing is not bad. The story is as well told as it can be, but the story just does not need to be told again. ",/review/rw7933951/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2015,bkoganbing,8," Hope springs eternal
",Jake Gyllenhaal gives his fans his best work since Brokeback Mountain as light heavyweight champion Billy Hope who suffers a horrific personal tragedy beyond any I've ever seen in a boxing film and comes back from it. For what he goes through Sylvester Stallone had it easy. As Brokeback Mountain got him an Oscar nomination maybe Southpaw will do the same.,/review/rw7933951/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2015,MattBirk,5," About as Generic as a Boxing Movie could be!
","This will be short, Southpaw is about as straightforward as you would expect from a boxing movie. A once great fighter falls into despair only to be given another chance at redemption in some sort of title fight. This movie hit just about every single plot point you would expect it to. And that's what makes Southpaw feel so dull and unengaging, it holds too few surprises. He gets beaten down again and again only to find redemption later in the movie just as expected. This is the type of movie where if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie, period!",/review/rw7933951/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2015,tute_n,," Emotion, emotion and emotion...think about that, don't be an asshole
","First of all...this is wrong, why i have to write in English only, i want to write in Spanish, i don't have that right???. OK, going to the point that matters...the movie is extraordinary whether you are a boxer, whether you where a boxer or if you don't even know what boxing is, like someone says down here. I watch it in the night, and the next morning when i woke up i was feeling so weird (like in a good way i think). It provoke on mi something very difficult to describe. It touches my most intimate fiber, it came with a strong emotional charge. Although I understand that not everyone feels the same way, you never, NEVER can put 1,2,3, or 4 stars to this movie...they are qualifications to fit in Aladdin movie, don't be cruel, don't be like that, don't be that guy, think, with that qualifications the movie rate falls apart. The actor are really exceptional...Mcadams is great truly great, although she participates in the first part her essence will remain with you all the way. Forest...there is nothing to say about him that someone doesn't know, the way that he adopts that kind of character is beautiful. And Gyllenhaal is becoming one of my favorites really, he is truly magnificent. It can't be bad with persons who work in this level. Watch it please, y cannot take it out of my head, i repeat, at least for my as a boxing fan that i am, it left me with a mix of emotions that only few movies have provoke that on my. Just watch it an i hop you can enjoy it as i did. From Uruguay, my regards to all of you, enjoy your life.",/review/rw7933951/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2015,bartonj2410,9," Very good tale of redemption with a KO performance from Jake Gyllenhaal
","As with most sports dramas, Southpaw is a film more about the man than the sport. Labelled by many as the 'modern day Raging Bull', I had high hopes for Southpaw and thanks to Jake Gyllenhaal, it duly delivered. This is a tale of one man's path to redemption through boxing.",/review/rw7933951/?ref_=tt_urv

26 July 2015,blanbrn,8," A film of hope and soul finding after you losing it all redemption can be found!
","I must say that the new boxing drama ""Southpaw"" is a real knockout film a winner that delivers the punch on both ends for drama and emotion it proves that sometimes before you regain it you must lose it all! Billy Hope(Jake Gyllenhaal)is the raining and best known light heavyweight fighter on the planet who has it all from the championship belt, to a fine home and a fancy car with a cute little daughter to of course a hot sexy trophy colored bra wearing wife named Maureen(Rachel McAdams was just so fine in that sexy silk light pink colored bra scene!). All of a sudden the wife Maureen wants him to have a change of heart and mind and leave the brutal business of boxing, yet one by one Billy's fame and life is ripped away as he has his wife lost in a tragic accident, and thru bad promotion and debt he goes broke losing his home, belt and even due to his drug using ways the courts take away his cute little daughter. Wow Billy has hit rock bottom. Then he connects with trainer Tick Willis(Forest Whitaker)it's thru this time of learning and rediscovery of hope and heart that Billy once again rises to the top! Overall ""Southpaw"" breaks your heart with the tragic nature still it's a knockout tribute to the soul and heart for being able to discover that magic punch.",/review/rw7933951/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2015,A_Different_Drummer,9," ""I can't do this without you."" ""I can't do this with you."" (dialog)
","Too many reviewers have Rocky on the brain. Fact is, there is no shame is re-imagining a formula if it is a good formula to start with. Fact is, Hollywood does not make enough of these kinds of films to start with, usually letting the B-producers fill the gap with second rate product starring ex UFC stars. A delight to find an A-List production!",/review/rw7933951/?ref_=tt_urv

","Beastly acting. emotionally powerful and very moving. and an awesome job of making you feel what he is feeling. A unique and intriguing character brought to life by the phenomenal acting of Jake Gyllenhaal who has become one of the best. forest Whitaker, Rachel mcAdams and the kid were great too. 50 cent shouldn't have been in the movie tho (2 viewings)",/review/rw7933951/?ref_=tt_urv

25 July 2015,bhcoopa,5," Disappointment to Fighters; Plays on Stereotypical, Hyper-Aggressive Male Boxers; Not a Credible Story
","As a previous fighter, this movie is a disappointment. The movie stereotypes boxers as hyper-aggressive characters who need vice and aggressive behavior to handle the short comings thrown their way. Gyllenhaal's performance was pretty impressive in contrast to his previous roles, however it does not save the movie from its bad writing and directing. Although some of the boxing sequences aren't bad, some of them are awful and some are impressive, good fight sequences don't make a story great, and for that matter, a movie.",/review/rw7933951/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2015,classicsoncall,8," ""...you got to let her go through her thing and not think that thing is your thing.""
","To one degree or another we've seen this movie before. What's different in the approach for me were the parallel stories of Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhall) and Tick Wills (Forest Whittaker), each lamenting a course of action they took that led to terrible unintended consequences. Both outcomes resulted in the death of loved ones, for Billy his wife, and for trainer Wills, young Hoppy (Skylan Brooks) who Wills felt responsible for and didn't do enough to protect from a troubled family life. Both men seek some semblance of redemption by gutting out their despair and challenging themselves to take up the good fight once again.",/review/rw7933951/?ref_=tt_urv

8 July 2015,phate008,9," Southpaw: The Next Generation's Rocky!!
","I was lucky enough to catch an advance screening of this movie, and I was extremely glad I did. After watching the previews I felt as though a lot of the movie was given away, but I was blown away by the performances on screen. The movie was centered around a champion prize fighter hitting rock bottom, and slowly climbing his way back into the ring. It was an emotional journey that cannot simply be categorized as a movie about boxing, but rather, an inspiring and riveting tale of parenthood and a father's love for his daughter. The cast was excellent and everyone excelled in their roles. I wouldn't have expected to like Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson in a role as much as I did. Jake Gyllenhaal and Forest Whitaker had Oscar worthy performances. Everyone did a great job with their roles. The cinematography was fantastic, and the fight scenes gave some great first person shots that made you feel as though you were there in the ring fighting along side the actors. Overall, this movie is an experience that is not to be missed. 9/10",/review/rw7933951/?ref_=tt_urv

9 March 2022,stimpy_tr,9," Very Exciting
","I have seen many boxing movies recently but this seems to be one of the most exciting ones. The performance of Jake Gyllenhaal, the lead actor, is outstanding. He plays a boxer named Billy Hope. His psychological breakdown and efforts to win his daughter back is amazing. What is interesting is that he was in a completely different role in Prisoners (2013) and was at least as great as in this one. Supporting cast is also great, especially, Forest Whitaker and Li'l Oona Laurence.",/review/rw7933951/?ref_=tt_urv
