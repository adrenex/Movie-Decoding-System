17 February 2006,TheMovieMark,7," If you enjoyed the prevous two then you should dig this.
","Poor Death. The guy can't seem to catch a break. He's got a job to do, and now for a third time he's being kept from doing it. What's worse is he's being foiled by a bunch of high school kids! That can't be good for the ego. Within that context you can't really blame the guy for trying to finish the job. Heck, if I were Death I'd totally relish taking some of these brats out. Particularly the guy who calls himself Frankie Cheeks. Sheesh, if that guy were any more annoying then his name would most likely be Chris Kattan.",/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2020,UniqueParticle,10," I love this one
","Ghoulish sickening very good sequel, might not be appreciated as much the original but I love it! The way everything plays out is great, the music, sound effects, characters, and the deaths are awesome to me! I absolutely the madness in Final Destination 3 it's quite different. James Wong's versions are the best despite any flaws they have. Mystery and suspense are such a great aspect.",/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2007,mjw2305,6," Much the same as the first, and it could stand alone without seeing the other 2
",Final Destination 3 is basically the same film as Final Destination only this time its a roller coaster crash not a plane exploding that disrupts deaths plan.,/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2006,Robert_duder,8," A Horror Series turning out to be really something!!
","Uniqueness is something very, very hard to accomplish in the Horror Genre nowadays. Slasher films almost always have the same M.O. and that's not a bad thing but to find a unique one that started in 2000...Final Destination stands alone. In this third installment, six years after the original (three after the second one) it continues it's own M.O. and continues to impress and be a really great series that is possibly one of the most disturbing and scary films out there just for it's sole realness to it. Final Destination works like a comedian...ie: It's funny because it's true...well this is Horror because it's true. No other film makes you think hard about every single object, situation and chain reaction you can possibly think of.",/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2006,Merklin,7," I thought i was in for a disappointment. I was wrong .........
","I'm not gonna lie to ya, i wasn't looking forward to final destination 3.Just seeing a roller coaster full of screaming people on the poster made me roll my eyes and assume that this franchise has run out of steam .",/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2017,TheLittleSongbird,7," A deadly ride
","While it was not a great or perfect film (particularly in the dialogue, ending and some of the acting), the first 'Final Destination' was entertaining and effective (especially with its terrific opening plane sequence and the creative deaths) with a fascinating idea done well.",/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2012,ma-cortes,6," Chilling and thrilling sequel with emphasis on increasing the luridness of the set pieces death scenes
","Entertaining follow-up and again with horrifying killings . Eerie chiller with portentous special effects and results to be a nasty piece of work . This sequel of successful original by James Wong deals with a beautiful student of a High School senior named Wendy Christensen ( Maria Elizabeth Winstead ) who along with her friends go to a theme park and decide to go on a large roller coaster . There Wendy has a vision and aware which by avoiding it, she and others ( Ryan Merryman , Texas Battle, Chelan Simmons , Amanda Crew ..) around her have saved but soon begin dying in bizarre accidents . The girl's premonition of a deadly roller-coaster ride saves her life and a lucky few, but not from death itself which seeks out those who escaped their fate . Amusement and entertainment resides from attempting to guess which of the ludicrously over-determined potential hazards will deliver the creepy killings .",/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2006,manicman84,6," abounds with awesome deaths
","To be honest, I hadn't expected too much from ""Final Destination 3"" as the 2nd installment disappointed me. While the 1st part was refreshing and suspenseful, the following one was repetitive and went over the top. What about ""Final Destination 3""? It's a some kind of combination of two previous installments. In the film seriousness coexists with comedy, while the latter is more frequent than the first. Comedy, most of all, stems from characters with very low IQ. One of them shouts with superiority something like ""death will never defeat me"" and then dies in most ridiculous way. Thus, the film is intentionally laughable at times. What's more, the flick abounds with awesome deaths and these quality gore scenes are probably the biggest virtues of this horror movie. Besides, the script is rather superficial and repetitive. I only liked an idea of photos depicting how victims will die. That's it. Other feature ideas were taken from previous parts. To sum up, this flick is worth watching especially with your mates.",/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2006,Davyd420,7," Same story, just more creative ways to die.
","Once you've seen Final Destination there's not much more of the story to tell, or twist, or reveal. All three films could actually be compiled together to make one long film, in other words, the story is told and the scene is set in part one, the two that follow just get more creative with how messy, bloody, and bazaar each person is slaughtered. And thats why I love these films.",/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2015,hitchcockthelegend,7," Roller Toaster.
","Final Destination the series moves into its third instalment without really changing the formula that was working for it. Here the opening disaster involves a Roller Coaster crash that is brought via a premonition to Wendy Christensen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). As in the previous two films, the visionary and some friends get spooked and get off the coaster to find it actually does crash and a bunch of horrific deaths befall all those on board. Sure enough the survivors start being killed off in equally gruesome ways, it becomes apparent that the old grim reaper is out to claim the deaths that were denied him.",/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2006,crazy_chick0000,8," Very Interesting
","I'd just have to say that this movie was a grand slam. OK so it wasn't all that good, but its good enough to hold your attention. If you have seen the 1st 2, the 3rd is a charm. It just makes you wonder how can you beat death this time. There is much more action and effects in this one. It is guaranteed to make you jump out your seat. For all you people out there who can't hold their stomach, this movie is NOT for you. The way it ended, I don't think there will be another one. Movies don't have a 4 or 5 do they? Unless you are Wes Craven. LOL! This is one of the coolest trilogies that are out there,besides Scream. I give this movie a thumbs up without a doubt.",/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2006,michaelRokeefe,6," Cheating death? Good luck.
","Third and fright filled installment of the FINAL DESTINATION series. Simalar to the others...just different situations causing the splatter of blood and other human matter. On a Graduation party at an amusement park, a Senior named Wendy(Mary Elizabeth Winstead)has a premonition of a fatal roller coaster accident that will have the survivors not knowingly pay for cheating death.",/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2006,totally_animated,10," The camcorder in FD3
","Brilliant film, way better than FD2 (plot wise i mean), Anyway I've seen FD3 twice now and noticed something on the coaster crash, in Wendy's premonition Frankie Cheeks's camcorder falls and wraps around the track causing the first car to derail killing Wendy's boyfriend and best mate, but in reality when they get off, he takes his camcorder wit him so in fact when it does crash, the camcorder isn't there and wouldn't have derailed the car. I might have missed another point as i know its not always one thing in these films but I thought i would just get the word out. Anyway I think the film rocks and is an excellent end to the trilogy. ""there is no accidents, no coincidences and no escapes"" (especially 3 times in a row)",/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2010,Theo Robertson,6," A Step Down From The Second Film
",I recently had a PM conversation on the topic of horror films with someone who doesn't like horror films . They mentioned my review of FINAL DESTINATION 2 and thought the film might have been better if the film had set out to horrify or repulse the audience rather than amuse or entertain them . I felt this was unfair since the FD movies work in a similar manner to the classic episodes of CASUALTY where the audience are trying to second guess the script as to what happens next . We see a lingering shot of a chip pan thinking it'll suddenly burst in to flame only to have our expectations quashed as a plane crashes out of the sky fatally injuring the occupant of the house . CASUALTY started losing a lot of acclaim when it started to metamorphoses in to yet another soap opera . Having said that after you've seen FINAL DESTINATION 3 you start to realise how much the franchise did become a wasted opportunity ,/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2006,GradysGhost,7," Entertaining, loads of fun...
","Synopsis: Wendy (Winstead) has a wild hallucination in which she sees her own death, along with about seven others who she is able to save initially, on a roller coaster. Afterward, ""Death"" is out to finish the task that Wendy thwarted. ""He"" has a calculated plan to off the others in the order they would have died on the roller coaster. It is discovered first that intervention can cause ""Death"" to ""skip"" a life and move on to the next, and that the manner of the deaths can be predicted (to a degree) by examining photographs of the survivors taken on the night of the crash.",/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2006,travisvincent,8," Excellent Movie!
","I went to a midnight screening of this movie with a friend who hadn't seen the franchise yet but knew of the movie. She was scared. it was great. The roller-coaster scene is really cool, in fact, the death scenes were really inventive and were fun to watch. The ending, was really good too, completely caught me off guard. i have to say, this is one fun movie! the acting was great, the special effects, or better known today as CGI, were pretty impressive as well. The best part was watching the elements in the scenes conspire to come together to whack someone off. clever movie franchise and totally worth seeing. i highly recommend seeing this movie.",/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2021,frosty-44431,10," THE BEST ONE
",I think many FD fans will always tell you to watch this one. Even until today queuing up for a roller coaster someone will have to mention this film for the extra fear. Some really memorable bits and the best one in my opinion.,/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2006,BA_Harrison,8," Great funFD3 delivers the goods!!
","With the third in the Final Destination series, it's definitely a case of 'if it ain't broke, then don't fix it' . Director James Wong produces a carbon copy of the previous movies, but still manages to deliver a roller-coaster ride of thrills and chills.",/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2014,lledain-796-978822,10," Fun, suspenseful, makes you paranoid. It's Final Destination!!!
",Wow. This film is just brilliant. It is my personal favourite in the franchise so far. Hoping for a 6. I love some of the irony placed in the movie as well.,/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2006,CyMaddux,3," Nail in the Coffin for the Series....
","First off how can 35% say this is a ""10"" there is no original concept here at all and surely the acting is not worthy to push it that high. What we have here is the third installment of a decent concept thriller movie that literally falls flat on its face- and meets its death.",/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2006,batpickle,7," FD 3 not bad for 3rd in the series!
","I was pleasantly surprised by the 3rd installment of the FINAL DESTINATION series! The worst part of the movie is the beginning and the whole roller-coaster accident, the CGI was so obvious and not real good. The first death scene was lacking any imagination and not particularly gory so it was a let down, but after that it took it up a couple notches and really won me over!! Let's face the facts we go see these types of movies for the gore factor! These types of movies aren't scary so the gore better be good and this one was! If you go in expecting great gore below average acting and a so-so story line then you won't be disappointed! I loved it for what it is supposed to be! I would recommend seeing it, buying it and showing it to your friends if you are all fans of this genre!!!",/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2006,boyinflares,8," The Franchise that keeps getting Stronger
","The First ""Final Destination"" was quite good and had an interesting new premise for horror. ""Final Destination 2"" was a major improvement, right from the horrific opening scene on the highway, to the unusual cast which surprisingly for horror did not consist mostly of teens or young twenty-something year-olds. ""Final Destination 3"" however, returns to the teen cast and is equal, if not better to ""Final Destination 2"".",/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2006,Deagy,10," Excellent
","I've always been a huge fan of the Final Destination series, mainly because it got me to look at the world in a whole new light. Granted, a slightly paranoid light, but a new light all the same. Any film capable of doing this deserves some recognition! The first and second were 2 gory, brash and trashy films, and didn't attempt to pretend they weren't, and the third followed the same route.",/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2016,Leofwine_draca,6," The worst set-piece accident yet, but it's better than the second film
","Back in the '80s, this would have been a slasher film, with a physical killer murdering the teenagers in gruesome ways, one by one. Two decades later, the new millennium favours 'curse' type slasher movies, probably because of the Japanese influence This is the third entry in a film series in which the unseen presence of death claims teenagers one by one in increasingly inventive and gory ways.",/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2021,Calicodreamin,7," FD3 is why I have never been in a tanning bed
","With no villain and impossible yet plausible deaths, final destination has a high octane creep factor that will keep you on edge for weeks after. The third installment is no exception. Wild deaths, decent acting, and no storyline necessary. This movie screams the 2000s, a girl with her flip phone and highlights.",/review/rw7606737/?ref_=tt_urv
