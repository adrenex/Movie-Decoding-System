27 April 2021,chrisrowexxx,9," An old new show
","The negative reviews are silly, everything on tv has been done at some point. There are very few original series so to judge on that is naff. It's fun, innocent humour, the little girl is the absolute star. Like the big show show. The laugh tracks corny, music is fun addition, there's an arrogance to it where it feels unnatural but it's on you to get over it, it's cheesy, predictable but fun content with above average actors who are clearly talented. Really fun watch.",/review/rw6719249/?ref_=tt_urv

19 March 2021,djbear88,10," Nashville Sound of Music
",I watched all the episodes in one sitting. The show grows on you. You begin to care about the characters and what happens to them. It's funny and touching. The singing is great. Chemistry among the actors was believable. I want to know what happens now. Need another season.,/review/rw6719249/?ref_=tt_urv

23 March 2021,hafR33,10," Lovely, Warm, Funny, Best Netflix Series I've Seen
","It remembering me when I was a kid sitting in front of television, feel warm and fun. Everything in this movie feels great and heartwarming. Love the music, love the kids, love their chemistry. I watched all the episodes only 2 days and didn't skip any scene at all.",/review/rw6719249/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2021,fatimahaishah,10," Good old days!
","I loved this sitcom. It does exactly what it set out to do. Felt like a kid waiting for my sitcoms to air on TV once a week, but I got to do it all in one sitting. Is it cheesy, hell yeah, but this is what I grew up watching. So many fond memories this brings about. It's refreshing, funny, ridiculously unreal with amazing talent. I could watch this with my daughter. We both enjoyed it, and honestly, there aren't many things out there that's entertaining and satisfies both of us equally like this show. So much fun.",/review/rw6719249/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2021,amandal-59250,9," Knows what it's supposed to be.
","Yes, it's a cheesy sitcom. But at least it wasn't accidental. The goal was to be a cheesy sitcom, and it succeeded at being just that. And if you like shows with a laugh track and plotlines from the 2000s then this is the right show to watch. If you wanted something with drama and more of a real touch to it this is not the show for you. I enjoy the points made about grief in the show, and I admit, I wish these actors were in a better setting because their singing is really good.",/review/rw6719249/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2021,christeasdale-26776,9," Country is cheesy people!!
","Yes this sitcom is cheesy and I believe it's intended that way as country music is cheesy also. What I don't understand is how anyone could possibly be surprised that it is cheesy upon watching it. One look at the trailer tells you all you need to know. I don't mean to be rude but anyone who didn't get that from the trailer or even worse, doesn't watch trailers, can't be too bright.",/review/rw6719249/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2021,mirandasmith-83894,8," Had me in tears more than once
",Great sitcom with mostly lovely characters. For me not a 10 as often dialogues /Jokes are obviously staged and not natural.,/review/rw6719249/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2021,alcanindita,10," Literally fell in love with the show
","Literally fell in love with the show. Cliched theme, still so refreshing. Every single actor did full justice to his/her part especially the kids. Waiting impatiently for season 2.",/review/rw6719249/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2021,ofabeautifulnight,9," Wow!
","It started out a bit rocky but this show and its characters quickly won me over. Such a good, feel-good show. I really hope there will be a second season âœ¨",/review/rw6719249/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2021,lanna-sousa,10," Solid entertainment.
","Do not watch it expecting originality, plot twists, heavy drama, or outstanding writing... BUT DO EXPECT A GREAT FAMILY TIME.",/review/rw6719249/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2021,angeline-81250,10," Takes me back to family TV night when I was a kid
","I loved Boy Meets World, Full House, Growing Pains, etc., when I was a kid, and sitcoms remain my favorite genre. Always an easy story to wade through, never too heavy, just lighthearted, WHOLESOME, fun, funny. Exactly what I need when I'm trying to decompress. So it's no surprise I thoroughly enjoyed Country Comfort! The show is a good mix of funny but also heart. Very much like the shows from my childhood. And even the recent reboot of One Day at a Time, where there's funny moments but they don't shy away from the real emotions of life either. I really appreciate that. Doesn't always have to be joke on joke on joke. While it's pretty clear some of the young actors are quite new, they grow more and more charming as the episodes progress. I heard in interviews that behind the scenes they dealt with Covid interrupting their season, so when they got back into production there was no live audience. That explains the laugh track, but it didn't bother me. Then again, I genuinely enjoy sitcoms. And the music is fantastic. Katharine McPhee can SIIIING! I hope Netflix will give it a second season so we can see where the story goes now that they've found their way to being a concrete family unit. We need shows we can watch as families, not just shows the parents watch while the kids watch something separately. Bring back TGIF!",/review/rw6719249/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2021,jacobxwarren,10," Bingeable Sitcom with Great Performances
","The show is cheesy, but it's surprisingly well-written and boasts more than a few heartwarming moments. The kids are great but McPhee carries the show. It's a great comedic performance and she's never sounded better. I wasn't planning to like it as much as I did! Would definitely watch a second season. Netflix?",/review/rw6719249/?ref_=tt_urv

",Great family sitcom with a country sound of music feel! I loved it and hope for a season 2!,/review/rw6719249/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2021,knitty78,9," Partridge Family for the 21st century
","Is it cheesy? Most certainly, Is it heartfelt? Most certainly. I really enjoyed watching this series. The only reason not to give it a 10 is because the writing is so-so.",/review/rw6719249/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2021,johnc-5,10," The Ranch Part Two
","This show is like The Ranch and I mean that as a compliment. I think they even used the exact same sets. This show is not prestige TV but it is great TV. It's an adorable, engrossing show. I highly recommend this.",/review/rw6719249/?ref_=tt_urv

23 March 2021,SherryPhilyaw,9," What a Cute Family Series
","I was looking for something new and lighthearted tonight and found Country Comfort. What a stinkin' cute show. I binge watched every episode in one night. What a great show for the whole family. The characters are a bit quirky, but they really do kind of grow on you. After the first couple of episodes I texted a few friends to tell them to watch this show! I love the singing too! I'm ready for another season now!!",/review/rw6719249/?ref_=tt_urv

20 March 2021,carmenchapman-03879,10," Incredible talent
","I was really impressed by how talented the young actors were in their roles. This is definitely a throwback to a regular family sitcom, but much much better because the kids are very talented actors, musicians and singers. Katherine McPhee has an amazing voice. The music is beautiful. I think that a lot of the criticism that you see toward the show is mainly political against good old fashion family shows. So take the criticism with a grain of salt and make up your own mind.",/review/rw6719249/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2021,jdalich79,10," Cute Family Show with warm and sweet characters
