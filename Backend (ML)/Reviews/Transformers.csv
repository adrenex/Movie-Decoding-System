26 June 2021,lee_eisenberg,10," Jean Smart gets her day
","Jean Smart first entered my consciousness when she co-starred on HBO's ""Watchmen"", although it turned out that I had seen her in movies for years. With her back-to-back roles on HBO's ""Mare of Easttown"" and ""Hacks"", Smart has truly secured her place in TV history. Her lead role in the latter is funny without being insulting, dramatic without being boring, and all-around lovable. Both a look at standup comedy and the differences between generations, this show does everything perfectly. I hope that Jean Smart finally earns the renown that she's long deserved.",/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2021,mzand-751-539572,10," FINALLY, A Quality All-American Comedy Series
","Hacks, starring Jean Smart, is a rare, smart and actually funny comedy to stream on TV these days. The setup is that established, and successful comedy legend Deborah Vance (brilliantly played by Jean Smart) is in danger of losing her Vegas residency because the owner of the casino wants to bring in more 'relevant' acts to appeal to a younger crowd. To punch up her act, she is (against her will) paired with a young, talented but also arrogant and entitled Gen Z comedy writer Ava (Played by newcomer Hannah Einbinder, original SNL cast member Laraine Newman's daughter) so she can be more current. The smart writing that features the dynamic of a grizzled, baby boomer comedy veteran with a strong work ethic clashing with a talented but spoiled Gen Z'r is sauce that makes this show. It's hard to believe that this is Einbinder's first gig because she more than holds her own against the always dazzling Jean Smart. Unlike so many current comedy series that telegraph their jokes before they hit you in the face, Hacks understands that most of the comedy is what happens between the characters and, the really funny dialogue, like in all great comedies, is never hammered at you but thrown away. Finally, a comedy series to look forward to every week.",/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2021,jaimemedina-36288,9," Fresh take, great chemistry
","While I'm not loving Jean Smart in Mere of Easttown, she is spot on in Hacks. There's great chemistry between the to along with great critiques of the absurdity of celebrity and fame. The whole thing feels fresh and innovative.",/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2021,MovieQween-33622,10," Jean smart is supreme
","This role was made for her and no one else. She is pure magic & I hope she wins every award! My mom & I both love this show. Also newcomer Hannah Einbinder (Lorraine Newman's daughter) is also quick & whitty, they have great chemistry. Can't wait to enjoy the rest of the season!",/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2021,UniqueParticle,10," So worth watching Hannah Einbinder and Jean Smart are exceptional
","Definitely deserves the 3 Emmy wins, I'm glad I decided to watch Hacks. It's very entertaining, captivating, and an exciting story about 2 people in need of work! I started running out of shows to watch recently so this is perfect fun!",/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2021,sydnee_man,9," Great new show
","I'm not sure why this is starting off with a low rating. Maybe it's because the show is centered around strong, yet flawed, females. I've seen the first two episodes and I'm looking forward to more. Jean Smart is great in everything and Kaitlin Olson (from Always Sunny in Philadelphia) is always fun to watch. I'm not familiar with the the actress who plays Ava, the young writer in need of a job, but she's very good as well. I'm sure as more people get a chance to watch this, the rating will go way up. It deserves at least an 8.",/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2021,julieshotmail,9," Jean Smart is enjoyable to watch
","The most prolific actress to come out of ""Designing Women,"" Jean Smart is wickedly funny while also capable of serious dramatic roles in shows like ""Fargo."" In her golden years, she is everywhere, mostly playing supporting roles like Kate Winslet's mom in ""Mare of Eastown."" Finally, though, she gets to be the lead in her own series, showcasing her talents and wit for all of us to enjoy. ""Hacks"" is essentially a buddy comedy but with your non-typical duo: an aging rich lady with an entitled Gen-Z female sidekick instead of your typical two white men. This combo takes you to unprecedented fresh jokes, and thanks to the undeniable chemistry of the two actresses, ""Hacks"" is one of the funniest new comedy series to come around.",/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2021,filmjim999,," Smart is Great
",While watching the first two episodes I thought maybe this is ever so loosely based on Joan Rivers.,/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2022,bosporan,9," Jean is not Smart, she is brilliant!
","A breath of fresh air, beautifully illustrating generational misunderstanding and strife in a thoughtful and humorous way. Jean Smart is absolutely fabulous as the jaded, acerbic comedian Deborah, who fears her relevance is fading. Hannah Einbinder is Ava, a Gen Z/Millennial who has been cancelled due to an offensive tweet.",/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2021,ocean_breeze1ca,10," GLAD I FOUND THIS
","Love Jean Smart, at first thought I wasnt going to get into this show. But I was wrong.. I am enjoying her and the cast, its super funny and warm, and the different personalities of her and her new hired writer;",/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2021,Laight,5," A very average effort
","Jean Smart is one of the most talented tv actresses around - she can do just about anything. But every actor needs a good script and the scripts here simply aren't good enough -- they rely too much on coincidence, improbable relationships, and a multitude of jokes that fall flat. So although the show is good-natured (in a weird kind of way) and has a number of excellent supporting characters, it's just not very funny or very intelligent. And, unfortunately for Hannah Einbender, she's up against a far superior actress and is basically out-played in all their scenes. On top of that, her self-centered, strangely unhumorous character is possibly the most unappealing one to appear in tv in a very long time. All in all, Hacks is just slightly better than a lot of what's on TV now -- maybe a second season will improve on its flaws.",/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2021,blanbrn,8," Bold, brash funny well written comedy of a past her prime lady living it out in Vegas(Sin City)
","""Hacks"" is sure one interesting and pushing the envelope like original series from ""HBO Max"" as it's words and actions are so outspoken and blunt. It features Jean Smart(as an elegant shiny silk colored blouse wearing cougar who's washed up and past her prime as standup comedian Deborah Vance) and Deb is living her days out feuding with her manager over shows and money, it's painful still her tone and mouth pack a punch on stage! Yet newer crowds want modern material so Vance is hired a writer to do her jokes and that's Ava(Hannah Einbinder) who's been suspended from sitcom jokes after being to racy. Both clash from the outset as ego and youth vs. Old school plays a factor in the drama. Each episode is a fun filled raunchy witty journey with actions and words as this feels at home for the city of Las Vegas. Vance is lonely yet still good even her relationship is strained with her grown daughter a sexy colored bra wearing care free party girl(Kaitlin Olson ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia""). Overall this may not be everyone's cup of tea for it's character clashes still it's open and honest and a journey for both the two central lead gals and it's very blunt and funny watch it for the brash outspoken roars of one Jean Smart.",/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2021,hotseatotsie,5," Watching Ava is unbearable. Stars are for Jean
","Jean Smart is a legend and this show has so much potential. But the actress playing Ava is beyond annoying. She overacts, makes really fake obvious facial expressions and there's just no chemistry with her and Jean. She is trying way too hard and it fails. Unfortunately she's on the screen more than Jean and I ultimately lost interest. I kept wishing they had just cast someone else because I wanted to keep watching but just couldn't.",/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2021,jordaneuserwalker,10," GENUINE, HILARIOUS, QUIRKY FUN!
","I'm not entirely sure what people are talking about. This show is glamorous, it's fun, it's dramedy, it's accurate to the entertainment industry and what people, especially women go through. It deals with the aftermath of cancel culture, it has religious undertones, it's layered. It's brilliant and I think you should give it a chance!",/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2022,On_The_Mark,5," Not really funny - semi-interesting and overrated

13 June 2021,jennfinn,9," Jean Smart Shines, Hannah Not So Much.
","I've always liked Jean Smart ever since Designing Women. She's a great actress, Deborah Vance is nothing like sweet Charlene Frazier. It's absolutely horrible that Jean's husband died unexpectedly during production and she's a true professional because you'd never know anything tragic happened while watching her amazing performance.",/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2021,becca-dietz,10," Jean Smart is everything!!!
","Jean is amazing to watch. The writing on this show is so great. Her character is a typical Las Vegas Diva but also relatable and hilarious. There are some real moments on this show that tug at heartstrings amongst all the comedy. I was hooked by episode 1, can't wait to see how the rest of the season plays out!",/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv

16 May 2021,kagonz1,10," Love it!
","So far, we saw the first episode only and love it. Jean Smart is always outstanding and highly watchable. She has the acting gravitas to pull off anything. The glitz of character's lifestyle, fashion, style, humors are a sorely needed gift. This series is exactly what we need right now. It's a high-quality form of escapism. I thought of Joan Rivers which is fantastic as I'm a major fan. She would have loved it too. Looking forward to seeing all episodes. Thank you!!!",/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2021,helenahandbasket-93734,10," Actually Funny-Who Knew?
","Typical Buddy series with women instead of men, but these women epitomize everything horrible about their respective generations- plus Christopher McDonald, that's all I needed to draw me in. His comedic timing and reactions are priceless, and enough to keep me watching.",/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2021,gordonhr,3," Mediocre at best
","I had high hopes but on the third episode lost my interest. Mainly because I had a hard time to believe that her assistant is able to deliver any god jokes for her. She is so pale, unfunny, gray, common character totally unconvincing to be a comedian with razor sharp edge and wit. Everything she says or do is so generation Z meek and uninteresting. Jean Smart is OK though, not great in this (because it is to much expected kind of acting and mannerisms for this role), but OK still.",/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv

",A show that revolves all around good writing is ironically completely devoid of it.,/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2021,BoomerDT,5," It's Needs More of Jean Smart...
","And the elimination of Hannah Einbender's character, Ava. But it looks like the finale of season 1 set the hook for the continuation of this smug and condescending hipster, who is quite willing to lie and back stab whenever she doesn't get her way.",/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2021,debren,10," Jean Smart YES YES YES
","Thank you Jean Smart for a ""Quality All-American Comedy Series"" to quote another review. My Husband & I have loved/adored you in everything! We are just a few years younger than you but this is what America needs right now...Take away the sadness, let us belly laugh, escape in ""Real Comedy"" & just laugh together. You have brought back what Comedy should be like. We are so very sad to hear about you're Husband's passing. Sending Prayers/Love/Thoughts to you & you're Family. Thank you for all that you do & have done. BEST SHOW EVER!!",/review/rw6914354/?ref_=tt_urv
