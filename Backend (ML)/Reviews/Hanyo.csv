17 November 2012,markdroulston,6," Terrific awfulness
","It's with a hint of sadness that the Twilight franchise has come to an end. Sure, they're terrible, terrible films (and books I assume), the popularity of which paints a sorry picture of the tastes of today's youth, but now that all is said and done, on reflection it was worth enduring the first three insufferable disasters (Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse) to get to the unbridled mayhem of Breaking Dawn (my thoughts on part one can be found here).",/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2012,bkoganbing,6," Volturis spoiling for a fight
",The Twilight Saga came to an end with Breaking Dawn Part II as Robert Pattinson and Kristine Stewart try to settle down as best they can with the ever present threat of the Volturi clan looming over them. They've even made some kind of arrangement with Taylor Lautner and the Indian clan of werewolves to serve as protectors of their daughter.,/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2012,3xHCCH,6," The Saga Ends As Cheesy As It Started
","I have just come home from watching this last installment of the Twilight Saga, Breaking Dawn Part 2 with my wife. I don't know what is with these Twilight movies that we look forward to watching them, simply to see how bad they are. Haha! The poster showing the three main characters running did not hold much promise of a better film.",/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2018,DansLeNoir,," Best movie in the series
","WHY? It did not have to be romantic. The first end was more beautiful. Why did not it end? If it was so, I gave it 9 points. Apart from that, it was a pleasant film that was exciting. Entering new characters was also nice.",/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2012,TheLittleSongbird,4," An improvement over Part 1, but goes out on a whimper rather than on a bang
","As said in my review of Breaking Dawn: Part 1, I am neither a fan or detractor of the Twilight Saga, though in terms of the books I only lasted the first chapter of the first book. Of the movies, for me the best was Eclipse, and the worst New Moon. In terms of Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 I'd say that it is a marginal improvement over Breaking Dawn: Part 1 and ranking the whole saga I'd put it bang in the middle, but for a finale to a film series I found it very underwhelming.",/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2020,TheHoodOfSwords,5," Entertaining At Least :)
","At this point I feel like I need to just enjoy Twilight. Yes it's cringy, and in this movie Bella is obviously better than literally any other vampire to ever exist in literally 2 days. There is a final battle that I enjoyed. That's about it. It's done, it's satisfying I guess.",/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2012,misterkevinoh,6," Not A Twilight Fan- Still Enjoyed It
","Now look, I'm no Twilight fan. I watched the first movie and forgot it after an hour. I talked to some Twilight fans in the theaters to fill me in on what the movie was going to be about. I came in with prior knowledge of what imprinting was, what Bella's daughter was like, all the good stuff. From what I understood, this movie was basically The Deathly Hallows Part 2(a terrible movie by the way). My thoughts were, ""Oh no! Not another fan service movie with no soul!"" I sat down and awaited the eventual sleep that would take me out of the boredom I would experience from such a bland movie. ",/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2012,Matt_Layden,5," The Best & Worst Twilight.
","This is the first time I sat in a theatre to watch a Twilight movie. I think the theatre experience maybe helped me enjoy the film more than I should have. Nevertheless, Breaking Dawn Part II is not only the best entry in the franchise, it's also the worst. How can that be? For a good 20 minutes, the film tries to be daring and does something different. Yet it is all undone by playing it safe and ruining what came before it. ",/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2012,rgkarim,8," Fifth Time's The Charm
","Hello, Hello all, I'm here with another movie review. This time I'm covering the latest in the Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2, and I hope to shed some light on the final episode of the series. Now you've seen plenty of debate in this series with many hating everything about this series, while others think it's the best vampire series to ever exist. With all the bias towards this series, it may be hard to determine whether this movie is worth spending time in the theater or should just be blown off. Let's see if I can shed some light on the subject.",/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2012,LeahJayne,7," Fans of the series will not be disappointed
","Breaking Dawn Part 2 is easily the best film in the series. Although if you're not a fan of the series, I guess that's not saying much. I personally enjoyed it very much. Part 2 introduces a lot of new characters, including Renesmee played by a very talented Mackenzie Foy. She is well-suited to the part, conveying a grown-up maturity inside a child's body. I liked Jacob the most in this film. Now that he's finally over his obsession with Bella, it's like a weight has been lifted from him. It was nice to see him finally get his happy ending. Edward and Bella are also at their best in this film. The dynamic between them is the most like how it is in the books. Bella is finally the strong, confident vampire she was always intended to be, and she and Edward are now free to be together without restraint. You can see Edward's relief that he no longer has to be so careful with his once very breakable human love.",/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv

23 November 2012,jaemiewaters,10," Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 2 hits a big bite
",The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 2 hits a big final bite. The final movie of the series is the best one out of all of them. I think if you like the Twilight movies than this Twilight movie will be the one that you will really enjoy that is how good Breaking Dawn Part 2 is. If you like drama movies and adventure movies than you will enjoy this one of a kind masterpiece. It is one of the best movies of the year. I think if you like movies that will put you on the edge of your seat than this is the movie that you will need to see. This movie is the worlds best i love it and i hope everyones likes it to because it is the best movie of all times. i just hope this review helped everyone,/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2013,siderite,6," Continues part 1 with the same blend of teen feelings and lack of purpose
","Having just watched the first part of the movie, which ended saying nothing after a whole bunch of feely scenes that also said nothing, it felt only natural to consider that at some time, after all was said and (hopefully) done, there will be a point to all of this. After all, this is a ""saga"" so it must have an ""epic"" ending. And it didn't, really!",/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2012,RichardSRussell-1,2," Revenge of the Department-Store Manikins
","This movie cost a reported $120,000,000. In only 2 weeks, it's already doubled that take at the box office, but what I'd like to know is where all that money went. Not on sets or locations, since it's mainly set in the woods. Elegant costumes, to be sure, but you're not gonna blow 9 digits' worth of bucks on epaulets. The effects are sparse and nothing special. Fersher not on the writing (execrable screenplay by Melissa Rosenberg).",/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Twilight Breaking down
","The only reason the movie is better than the book is for one reason. Even though it was a fake-out, at least they gave us an action scene instead of them showing up, they say two lines, and just leave!",/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2015,jacobjohntaylor1,1," A pooh pooh sequel
",This movie is awful. Twilight is great film. Twilight new moon is also a great film. Twilight eclipse is also a great film. But this is crap. It has an awful story line. And it has the worst ending ever. Good actors wasted there talent being in this awful movie. Do not wast your time. Do not waste your money. Do not see this awful movie. This movie is werewolf pooh pooh. Bella has picked Edward a long time ago so why even care about that. The way thing turn out with good with the evil vampires is just lame. This movie is pooh pooh. It the fifth Twilight movie and is just total pooh pooh. I take a big pooh on this movie. I was very disappointed by this movie. So I pooh on it.,/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2012,cattjones,5," Lights Out
","I am going to go ahead and confess that I have not seen any of the other Twilight films. I guess I am the person that buys the book, but only reads the last chapter (smile). I do have to say that in this case it really did not matter. There is so much publicity about these films that I pretty much know what happened in the other ones, so I really don't feel like I missed much. I don't even think that I needed to see part one of this 2-parter. This film could have stood on its own. I enjoyed all the special effects in the film, but I do have to say that when Renesmee was a new born the CGI kind of reminded me of an E-Trade baby. In this film Bella (Kristen Stewart) is getting used to the idea that she is now a vampire and is starting to flex her super natural powers. She also has to adjust her diet and Edward (Robert Pattinson) has the daunting task of helping her to control some of her now instinctual urges. I have to say that I thought that the vampires would be scarier than they actually were. Even the vampires of the Volturi were not that bad. I do want to say that Jacob (Taylor Lautner) was one big werewolf compared to the other ones. The whole story centers around a rumor gone wild and what can happen if you don't present all the facts. I think that I was a little disappointed because I thought that there would be more action than there was. Just to recap, you do not have to be a Twi-hard fan to see this film. I think that the ending was unexpected. I saw an interview that Kristen Stewart gave and she said that when the film was over, the whole cast did a dance number in the snow. I was hoping that they would put that at the end of the credits, but I am sure that it will pop up sooner or later. Will this film make me want to go back and see the rest of them., no, but I am glad that I saw this one. Some folks that have seen them all say that this is the best one. I can't agree or disagree, but I am going to take their word for it. I was not blown away so I am giving this film an amber light.",/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2021,Venomage03,6," Breaking Dawn - Part 2 was fine

3 September 2018,icecaralee,10," great adaptation of the book
","People are weirdly bitter about this saga. It's a great adaptation of the book. The whole series of movies does a good job. Some of these reviews are from people who've not even seen the other films let alone read the books. These movies are for the book fans. They are cast perfectly; the acting is exactly what it should be, overdramatized and slightly disjointed but perfectly in tune with the awkward Bella, hot tempered Jacob and out of his element Edward. Even the poorly animated baby still goes with the book. It's not meant to look like a real baby. People are just taking these movies way to seriously for what they are; young adult fantasy movies made for fans of a book series.",/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2012,mm-39,7," My wife likes the movie!
","Same story, but my wife likes the movie! Breaking Dawn has the same storyline and themes. Movie watchers experience the same sub stories of: the Cullens vs the evil vampires, alliances, the half human daughter, and what it is like to be a vampire! The themes of good vs evil, and the rules on how to be a good vampire continues. I found the movie redundant, but the final twenty five minutes has a plot twist. The plot twist saves the movie. B D part 2 has some good C G I and a few surprises I did not see coming. My wife said this and that was not in the book! Maybe part of the book did not translate well to film and the crew at B D 2 had to revamp the story. first part of B D 2 I give a 3 or 4 and the second half a 7. My wife would give B D 2 a 10. In the end, I guess B D 2 should be a 7 out of 10. On a side not I find all the Vampires look like they should be in a 1980's new wave music video.",/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2022,bellino-angelo2014,5," Fitting conclusion to an otherwise mediocre franchise
","First, I'll sum my thoughts about this series: I really hated the first TWILIGHT, I found the second slightly better, I kinda liked the third one (and probably deserves to be named the best in the franchise) but the fourth one was a huge step backwards to badness, and when this final chapter ended I thought ''Thank God it's finally over''. Now I can go to the review.",/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2018,arshdeep-61438,10," Best movie ever
","I'm a guy and I watched this movie finally while I was randomly scrolling through channels on the TV.
I had read the books a long time back, and didn't think I could watch the movie as it would mean going through the heartbreak of seeing a series end.
But boy, these guys have presented it so beautifully!
10/10 from me, a fan of the books.",/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2012,eelin-lim,7," It really wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, it was actually fine
","To be quite honest, this final installment of Twilight was not as bad as most people have made it to be. The only kicker is that you need to know some background story. If you're a guy following your girl to the cinema because of obligations, chances are you're going to not get this movie and will likely give it a very bad review. But if you would just play along with the plot, listen to your girlfriend for info and accept the supernatural aspect of the story, you might just enjoy it. Just sayin' guys. Don't be hatin' just for the sake of hatin'.",/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2012,thefilmdiscussion,2," An end to ""The Suckfest Saga"", and I'm not referring to the vampires
","Well, it's over. For some it's sad. No more shirtless Taylor Lautner (he strips all the way down to his skivvies in this one). No more cheesy- looking CGI that laughably tries to convince us that these vampires are kin to The Flash. No more horrid acting. No more horrid writing. Yes, gone forever is the cheap-shot money-maker that is ""The Twilight Saga"" soap opera. In the latest episode, which amounts to nothing more than an unenthusiastic excuse to showcase every person who was ever in these films and convince us that the ""saga"" was something bigger than it was (it's not), we wave goodbye to all of these things one last time. Sometimes, what looks great in your head as you read it in a book just doesn't work as well on the silver screen. This is a prime example. But sadly, no one really cares. This meritless movie franchise made money off of a brand, and that's all. What a waste of a pop-culture phenomenon. Oh well, I hear they're already rebooting it.",/review/rw2714927/?ref_=tt_urv
