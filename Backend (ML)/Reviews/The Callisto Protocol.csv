6 August 2011,darklydreamingrahu,7," Funnier than the reviews
","Bad Teacher is funny in ways it shouldn't be. Cameron Diaz owns the role of Elizabeth as the foul-mouthed, pot smoking, trashy blonde teacher with a twisted outlook on life. Obscenities and bizarre sexual innuendo roll off her tongue perfectly. Justin Timberlake is hilarious and awkward as Scott. His character is complex and....well he's just awkward....there's no other way to describe it. Lucy Punch is the perfect counterpart to both Diaz and Timberlake's characters as Amy Squirrel. Her over-the-top performance is one you will remember. Jason Segel steals every scene he's in as Russell the equally foul mouthed and dirty gym teacher. Phyllis Smith is an adorable and strange addition to the movie as the confused Lynn Davis, bringing her own brand of corkiness to the plot. All in all, the casting of Bad Teacher is flawless and is really where the movie shines. The punchlines are delivered with punch and the characters are decently developed and complex in their own ways. ",/review/rw2459025/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2020,pawanpunjabithewriter,7," Bad Teacher, Average Picture, Good review of the Picture
","Just watched it. It's just a timepass movie, watch if you have enough time. We are at a lockdown here, so yeah completely free. It has many funny moments, and a story as well. I went in not expecting one. Turned out to be quite decent. The movie picks up brilliantly and the cast have done great job. The two top teachers are remarkable. Students could have been better had they learn from a great classic movie Kindergarten Cop!
Average! Go for it if you have time!",/review/rw2459025/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2011,diac228,7," Let's hope they paid the actors more than the writers.....
","Bad Teacher is a great concept that resulted in a style of humor like most of the Adult Swim cartoons you see today: When the jokes hit they hit well, but when they miss, they miss quite badly. The cast was delightful, but could only go so far with the material. As a matter of fact, it was the cast that saved the movie from being a total disaster by providing their comedic chops, their charm, and their good comic timing that you don't see enough of nowadays. Despite all that however, Bad teacher is a shiny apple with a few rotten parts.",/review/rw2459025/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2011,RetroRick,," mildly amoral, refreshingly different.
","Am reviewing this to counter-balance the far too many negative reviews out there. This is a funny, not hilarious, but funny and sometimes cruel film about a bad teacher, who is funny because she is bad. Just like bad santa she isn't being held up an examplar for teaching or a role-model for young women (actually I'm not too sure about that). What she is is an anti-dote to the righteous, touchy-feely, moralising lesson preaching,heart-in-the-right-place films that normally dominate this genre, or at least do whenever there is a female in the lead. God knows the world would suffer if every film was like this, but a little bit of gentle cynicism is good thing in a world that is full of fraudulent fictional xmas cheer. Spoiler: As for the sensitive little boy not getting the girl, isn't about time that movies stopped lying to teenage boys that being nice & sensitive will get you laid.",/review/rw2459025/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2012,kosmasp,5," Bad Apple
","There is a certain energy in that movie. Especially at the beginning when Cameron Diaz seems invincible she has the time of her life (almost literally). There is a great sequence where she kinda falls down though which sets of the rest of the movie. Unfortunately even though it does make sense for her character, it does loose quite a bit of its pace from that point on.",/review/rw2459025/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2011,brando647,7," Meh...It's Good for a Few Laughs
","First Santa, now a middle school teacher. I feel as if we're on the verge of a new trend of bad *insert occupation here*. Bad toll booth operators, bad samurai deli clerkswhere will it end? Anyway, this is the latest from comedy director Jake Kasdan (WALK HARD) and a decently funny movie with some great moments but finds a major problem in its main character. 2011 hasn't been super strong with comedies; there have been some real good ones (BRIDESMAIDS) but most of them have been pretty forgettable (PAUL). This movie is pretty funny but it still ends on the low end of the spectrum. Cameron Diaz is Elizabeth Halsey, a gold-digging narcissist who has somehow made a career of being a middle school teacher. She believes she's found her way out with a rich fiancé to tend to her every need, but it falls apart when he finally realizes she's using him. Elizabeth is forced to return to her teaching job, where she proceeds to care even less than before. She fends off the advances of gym teacher Russell (Jason Segel) and focuses her attention on landing the new substitute teacher, Scott (Justin Timberlake). Elizabeth realizes that the only way she'll snag Scott's attention is a little self-improvement. Not becoming a decent person or anything, just a breast enhancement. From then on, she lies, cheats, and steals her way to the money she'll need for the surgery; and the only one who suffers is the good teacher (Lucy Punch) who just wants Elizabeth to do her job.",/review/rw2459025/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2011,george.schmidt,8," Diaz shows off her comic chops in this hit-and-miss raw comedy.
","BAD TEACHER (2011) *** Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake, Lucy Punch, Jason Segel, John Michael Higgins, Phyllis Smith, Thomas Lennon, Eric Stonestreet, Dave ""Gruber"" Allen. Off-putting, slatternly Diaz (never better with her comic chops and full-game here) faces uncertainty after being dumped by her rich fiancé and forced to return to her teaching gig but finds a possible way out in the unlikely goal of saving money for new breasts to woo over dorky new substitute teech (JT ably deconstructing his 'sexy back' image) despite goody-goody colleague Punch (who nearly steals the film) from gumming up the works. While director Jake Kasdan keeps things lively (including a laugh-out-loud seduction sequence involving dweeb testing administrating rep Lennon) the f-bomb dropping screenplay by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisneberg is hit-and-miss and frankly could have been even dirtier/nastier and funnier. Not an A for effort but a nice try.",/review/rw2459025/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2011,xyz72,8," Not a perfect movie, but much better than some reviews suggest.
","Let's face it, the reason many people call Bad Teacher the ""worst movie ever shot"" is not rational, it doesn't have to do with the movie itself in any way. From the reviews I have read on here the main problem seems to be the moral values in this film leading many ""oh so shocked"" viewers to give bad reviews, question people's sanity for producing this movie and hate everything about it - whether they admit it's the reason they dislike it or pretend to hate everything about an objectively well crafted film. But this movie is not supposed to teach anyone life lessons, it's not supposed to have some big, moral message about how to live your life in a good way. This is a film for adults. And films for adults do not have to follow certain morals because an adult is expected to judge morals on their own without needing guidelines. An adult can enjoy movies with main characters doing things they would never find acceptable because it's not about agreeing with the character's actions.",/review/rw2459025/?ref_=tt_urv

","Cameron Diaz plays an extremely self-centered individual who is looking for a rich man to marry after her fiancee dumped her because she was a gold digger. (She claims she caught him with the dog and peanut butter.) Teaching junior high gets in her way as she ""needs"" augmentations to be able to compete with all those Barbie Dolls out there. She uses movies to babysit her class. The gym teacher is interested in Cameron (she don't date gym teachers). Cameron in turn has her eyes on a nerdy substitute teacher (Justin Timberlake) whose family comes from money. He however likes Amy Squirrel.",/review/rw2459025/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2015,anaconda-40658,7," Bad Teacher. Good Film.
","Bad Teacher (2011): Dir: Jake Kasdan / Cast: Cameron Diaz, Jason Segel, Justin Timberlake, Lucy Punch, Phyllis Smith: She is indeed, bad. She sleeps during class while the students are watching movies. She grades tests using profane vocabulary. To top it off she uses a student car wash to raise money for a boob job. She is played with great flair by Cameron Diaz and the film opens with her leaving teaching to settle down in married life only to be dumped by her fiancée whose mother sees through her greedy intentions. She returns to teaching the following year and sets her sights on a new teacher, played by Justin Timberlake but his affections are being competed for by the uptight Miss Squirrel, played by Lucy Punch. Director Jake Kasdan made the music mockumentary masterpiece Walk Hard: A Dewey Cox Story. He doesn't match that greatness here but he does create a fantastic stage for the comic talents of Diaz who is merciless in her quest for success. She will manipulate and scam until luck favors her. Jason Segel as the gym teacher whom she ignores is well played but flat. Timberlake is quite different as the nerdy teacher unsmittened with Diaz. He will learn a lesson or two that will leave him with no romantic resources. Punch steals her scenes as she competes with Diaz and seemingly wins until her quests for sabotage backfires. Phyllis Smith plays another teacher who befriends Diaz but she cannot steal scenes here the way that Punch seems able to. It is a crude yet often funny take on an individual unable to fit in within an area where she is clearly no good. Score: 7 ½ / 10",/review/rw2459025/?ref_=tt_urv

","How many millions of dollars went into this which could have been used better in some other venture? Sour premise of a dope-smoking, opportunistic junior high school teacher who skates through her job, looking for a way to fund her breast augmentation job so she can land a rich boyfriend. Ends up committing several felonies & getting a stuffy but honest co-worker blamed for everything (including drug use on school grounds) while she wins the day. The redemption is her hooking up with an angry gym teacher when he proves the affluent guy she's sharking for is a shallow imbecile.",/review/rw2459025/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2015,davispittman,8," One of the better comedies today. Impressed!
","Bad teacher is a hilarious modern comedy about a teacher who does nothing, and is looking to raise money for a fake boob job. Lynn in this movie was the best part!! She was friggin hilarious. Her and Cameron together was priceless! Two very talented comedic actresses. Justin Timberlake also did a pretty good job with his role. Jason Segal's character didn't really become important until a little later into the movie, but I thought he did a good job with his material. And lastly, mrs. Squirrel, that actress did a GREAT job with her character, I really enjoyed her. This movie does have it's flaws, but I feel like most off them are overshadowed by the movies overall energy and fun nature. So if you haven't already check out bad teacher, it's lots of fun!",/review/rw2459025/?ref_=tt_urv

","I know others will disagree with me, but this has got to be in the running for the pick for the Razzies this year. What a pathetic piece of crap. The storyline was boring and the jokes either over-the-top, or, worst, not even close to funny. It never fails to amaze me when really bad ideas not only get to be screenplays, but they actually wind up getting produced. And...Timberlake's character...what was he thinking when he took this role??? Yeah, Diaz is still a hot body and all, but even that couldn't save something so downright dumb. I won't bother with any spoilers; it's not worth the effort. Save your money. This one will simply insult your intelligence. I would give it a minus one if I could.",/review/rw2459025/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2011,StevePulaski,5," I think I'll be excused
","Bad Teacher is a hit and miss comedy, with a fair number of laughs, but a fair number of plot holes and questions. Before I even thought about this movie after seeing it, I went and watched Bad Santa for the first time. Both films have a similar premise with the lead character being unpleasant and offensive. But Bad Santa was written with a more style of dark comedy, and let's not forget, with a corrupt childhood and a ""whatever"" attitude, Billy Bob Thornton's character had a perfectly good reason to be ""bad"" and mean. Cameron Diaz has none other than she is just mean-spirited and has chosen to pursue a miserable lifestyle.",/review/rw2459025/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2011,kdishron,," HIGHLY underrated!
","So, this movie was released in theaters around the same time as Bridesmaids. ALL anyone could talk about was ""Omg Bridesmaids is amazing! Bridesmaids, Bridesmaids, Bridesmaids!"" So, I ventured to the theater and bought a ticket for Bridesmaids. It was funny, but not incredibly so. Kristen Wiig is one of my favorites but I found her character lackluster and felt she could have done it better. ANYWAY, later, I decided to go see Bad Teacher out of complete boredom. I didn't know what to expect, I wasn't a Cameron Diaz or Justin Timberlake fan. Actually, I only really was excited to see Phyllis from The Office.",/review/rw2459025/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2011,estebangonzalez10,2," Bad, Terrible, Awful Teacher
","¨She doesn't give an 'F'¨ I don't know what is worse: Cameron Diaz's character as a teacher, or the movie itself. This is really a very bad movie, terrible. It's supposed to be a comedy, but it really doesn't have many funny moments. Yes there is a couple here and there, but in a 95 minute long movie you expect much more laughs. This raunchy comedy had a whole lot of raunchy, but no comedy whatsoever. I really hated this film, and expected a lot more from Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake, and Jason Segel who have done much better movies in the past. I can't blame it on them because the script they were given was really poor, but then I ask myself why would these actors want to be in a movie with a script as bad as this one. This isn't the first time that Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg fail as screenwriters in a comedy. These are the same guys that were responsible for the Year One fiasco starring Jack Black and Michael Cera. Director Jake Kasdan, however, has done far better in the past with funny films like Walk Hard and Orange County. Bad Teacher was a huge misstep for him, and for everyone else who was involved in this project. This could very well be the worse film of the year in my opinion. Cameron Diaz might not give an F, but I definitely will give this film an F for being the disaster it was.",/review/rw2459025/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2011,neil-476,7," Fun, but...
","You know exactly what you're getting with Bad Teacher - you're getting Cameron Diaz as a bad teacher Elizabeth. In her private life she is looking to hook a rich husband for his money: she smokes, drinks, takes drugs, swears a vast amount and sleeps around. As a teacher she does all that stuff, too: she is also a slacker, can't be bothered to remember her students' names, steals, abuses the kids... The list goes on and on. There is a plot of sorts, which involves Elizabeth trying to get money through fair means or foul (mostly foul) for a boob job in order to hook rich substitute teacher Justin Timberlake, and the efforts of by-the-book but irritating teacher Amy (Lucy Punch) to foil her, but the title pretty much says it all.",/review/rw2459025/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2011,DarkVulcan29,2," BAD is the only thing right in the title.
","I'm not against this type of story, but it throws everything at you, and comes across like it was trying too hard, makes the jokes feel very forced, and when it does that, the humor just dies down. Bridesmaids was a lot funnier, at least the jokes in that didn't come across like it was trying too hard.",/review/rw2459025/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2012,Floated2,3," Not much of a comedy
","Bad Teacher is one of those comedies that terribly misjudges the reverse appeal of its central character. Cameron Diaz plays Elizabeth, a middle-school teacher who's only serving time until marriage releases her from the necessity of doing anything but pamper herself. Then her fiancé breaks up with her and she has to begin her seduction scheme all over again, getting a fake-boob job and making contact with colleague (Justin Timberlake). Lucy Punch plays a bright-spark teacher who becomes her rival. What the film fails to see is that Elizabeth's not ""bad"" in a funny way – she's venal, grasping, rude, lazy and ignorant. Loathsome, in fact, and not funny. Jake Kasdan, once a promising director, doesn't have a clue how to make it work. The trailers have made the film seem it was more comedy oriented. ==================================================================== ==================================================================== ======",/review/rw2459025/?ref_=tt_urv

","Another comic ""gem"" to satisfy the cravings of an increasingly stupid viewing audience, ""Bad Teacher"" is accurately titled. Cameron Diaz, who is also a bad actress, is indeed very, very bad in this film. Her character is entirely absent any remotely positive traits. There's nothing to like about her, and yet we are supposed to root for her. A film with a title like this would once have been relegated to the porn industry.
