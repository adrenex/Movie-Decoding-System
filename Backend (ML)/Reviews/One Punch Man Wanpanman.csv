7 January 2017,Hitchcoc,8," Don't Take It So Seriously
","If you are unwilling to accept the basic premise of the film, that a child who has surgery on a broken arm is suddenly able to throw a pitch over 100 miles per hour, you aren't going to like this movie. I've been a baseball fan for 60 years and I know when a baseball movie is going to present an accurate portrayal of the game. If you read anything about this film and you are a purist, there are probably another ten movie to pick from this day. That said, this is a delightful film with a joyfulness that brings back memories of what it was like to be a mediocre baseball player, still hoping to be a major leaguer someday. The boy in this film is klutzy, so his entrance into a major league game is filled with fear and worry. There are good guys and bad guys, especially the father candidate. At some point, we know that reality will set in and, like ""Damn Yankees,"" someone is going to have to face a real situation. This is just charming and fun. Enjoy it. It was never meant to be a documentary.",/review/rw5765765/?ref_=tt_urv

3 June 2002,nucksfan4life,7," Another good ""kid-in-the-big-leagues"" movie
","For some reason, I get a kick out of movies like ""Rookie of the Year."" I guess the fact that so many young boys, myself included, fantasize about playing professional sports contributes to the popularity of this genre. I think Daniel Stern did a good job directing this movie because he doesn't ever let it become too kiddy and childish. Sure there are a lot of funny moments, but they can be funny to adults as well as children. The setting of this movie cannot be beat: Wrigley Field. It doesn't get any better than that. ""Rookie of the Year"" is a fun movie to watch with the family.",/review/rw5765765/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2010,g-bodyl,7," Not a Bad Sports Movie!
","Rookie of the Year is a pretty good sports movie even though I have seen better. I thought that Daniel Stern as the pitching coach was hilarious but in reality a guy like him would have been fired before the first pitch of the season-at least the late, great Steinbrenner would. It was also nice to see how a young teenager would adapt to the adult world of baseball.",/review/rw5765765/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2000,jhaggardjr,9," Very funny baseball comedy
","""Rookie of the Year"" is one of my favorite baseball movies. One of the things I liked the most about this movie is that it's set in Chicago, my hometown. Most of the action in the film takes place at Wrigley Field, home of the long suffering Chicago Cubs. It's about a clumsy 12-year-old boy named Henry Rowengartner, who loves to play baseball. However, the kid can't do anything right on the field. One day, trying to impress a girl, he tries to catch a fly ball. But ends up slipping on a baseball lying on the ground and in the process breaks his right arm. After four months of recouperation, the cast comes off. Afterwards Henry's mother gives him and his two best friends tickets to the latest Cubs game. The three boys are sitting in the bleachers when a home run is hit. The ball lands close to where they're sitting and one of Henry's friends recovers the ball. The fans sitting nearby yell at the kid to throw it back on to the field. The kid doesn't want to do it and gives the ball to Henry's other friend who ends up giving the ball to Henry. He agrees to do it. Then an amazing thing happens. Henry not only throws the ball back on to the field, he throws the ball all the way to home plate! The crowd is in stunned silence after seeing this. Who threw that ball? is the question on everyone's mind. When the owners find out it's Henry, they ask him if he would like to pitch for the Cubs. Henry goes bonkers and agrees to pitch. After throwing some practice pitches, the owners and managers discover that he has a 100 m.p.h. fastball. They think this could be the perscription the Cubs need since they're already going through another disasterous season (which is all too familiar in real life). Henry becomes the star rookie of the team as the closer. And the Cubs start winning and begin to turn their season around. ""Rookie of the Year"" has alot of big laughs and a terrific cast. There are four memorable performances in this film. Thomas Ian Nicholas is wonderful as Henry. This actor has grown up since this film (he was most recently seen in the hit film ""American Pie""), but he's in a role to remember; Gary Busey is also very good as the aging star pitcher known as 'The Rocket' who helps out Henry in certain spots; Albert Hall as the Cubs manager who repeatedly keeps mispronouncing Henry's last name in different formats; and Amy Morton, a Chicago stage actress, as Henry's mother Mary. Some of the most effective moments in the film are with the boy and his mom. Also there are hilarious smaller performances by Eddie Bracken as the Cubs owner; John Candy as the Cubs broadcast announcer; and Daniel Stern (who also directed) in the film's goofiest role as the dim-witted pitching coach. ""Rookie of the Year"" has the usual predictable sports ending, but since this film is so much fun, who cares. There is one obvious continuity error in the film. When they fly to L.A. to play the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium, you can tell they're really playing at Comiskey Park, home of Chicago's other baseball team, the White Sox. You can tell just by that, that this film was shot entirely in Chicago. ""Rookie of the Year"" is a baseball winner in my book.",/review/rw5765765/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2004,brian-crouch-1,," Bringing the fun back to baseball
","This movie asks the question: ""What if pro baseball was fun again, like in little league, and not so taken so seriously?"" The device of Henry's miraculous arm allows the story to inject a kid's eye view into a somewhat cynical world. Juxtaposing the sleazy Dan Hedaya's attempted $25 million trade of Henry to the Yankees with the Henry and his buddies taking a day trip on a boat, as well as Henry's adolescent antics on the field, director Daniel Stern is trying to get us to look at baseball, and maybe sports, maybe life, like we did when we were ten.

23 March 2000,Monika-5,," A fun film for everyone
","Sure, this movie is geared towards the younger generation, but I think that anybody can enjoy it, especially if you are a baseball fan. I don't know why people have criticized Rookie of the Year so much for being unrealistic. Duh! It's supposed to be fictional! What young kid hasn't dreamed of being a star player on a favorite pro sports team, and what Chicago Cubs fan hasn't wanted their team to go all the way? (Personally, I'm a Cleveland Indians fan, so I think you get my point.) ",/review/rw5765765/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2010,disdressed12,7," fun for the whole family
","this is a movie the whole family can enjoy.it's fun and there's nothing offensive about it.sure it is a bit over the top on occasion,and there is one running joke that is stretched a bit too thin.you'll know which one i mean about halfway through the film or earlier.but other than that,it's enjoyable,and you can allow your inner child to live on courtesy of the fantasy elements.also,it helps that the lead,Thomas Ian Nicholas(13 years old at the time)is engaging and charismatic.this movie won't change your life,but it should provide some laughs and keep you entertained for one hundred minutes or so.for me,Rookie of the Year is a 7/10",/review/rw5765765/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2016,mwcrunner,8," A good comedy for families
","This is a pretty funny comedy here for anyone's family to watch. You can also tell that Marv from Home Alone and Home Alone 2 is in this. Also at first I thought that Ernie Banks aka Mr. Cub was in this movie, but it was someone else that looked like him. One very funny part of this movie is when Henry's arm is fully healed and the joint in his arm was healed tightly he smacks the doctor in the face and the doctor shouted out, "" Funky butt lover."" XD. We also see lots of the scenes of this actually at Wrigley Field and that was all very cool. This movie is definitely recommended for families who enjoy good family comedies. 8 out of ten for this.",/review/rw5765765/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 1999,Venturin,9," A fun, warm film for the whole family.
","I really enjoy the film Rookie of the Year. I even bought the tape, and I pop it in once a month or so when I need a pick-me-up. It's funny and warm and rewarding as well. I really like the character of Mary, the mother of the boy with the 'rocket fire' arm. A single mother, she worries that her son has no one to look up to, but we learn things about her that gives the finale an extra shot of warmth. Daniel Stern did a very nice job of directing, and he got good performances all around. Gary Busey is great, and the way he and the other ball players come around to liking the kid is fun. I also like the pacing of the movie, there's always a 'moment' just around the corner. The film is full of fun moments, and when I start the tape I have to watch through to the end. Have kids? Have they seen this film? Give it a try, good clean fun family entertainment.",/review/rw5765765/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2021,LuckyFour-LeafClover,7," Childhood fantasies
",It seems kind of cheesy as a grown up but it was very fun for me as a kid watching this. In a way re-watching it all these years later reminds me of when sports were fun and not all heavily analytical based. Heck even in almost 30 years baseball has become way more corporate.,/review/rw5765765/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2016,daniel-schlachta,10," If you don't love baseball ...
",... or Gary Busey or the Cubs or twelve year old kids this thing is probably not for you. Otherwise I found some really good laughs in it. The story was appealingly filmed and professionally cut and so on. My point is that most Europeans don't have a clue about the game and it is quite important for the story. (For how long will this go on? - Well it's the third inning and they play at least eight. - God help me!) It is great to see how the boy is brought up by his mother to be nice to people and show them respect and how the really manly men repay the favor. All in all I give it a ten because it achieves what it aims for. Do watch it. If you can tell a sinker from a curve ball that is.,/review/rw5765765/?ref_=tt_urv

1 December 2010,jvfunn1,10," Very Good Baseball Movie
",I just watched Rookie of the Year on the Disney Channel and let me tell you. It's a great kids baseball movie about a boy named Henry who gets on the Chicago Cubs Baseball Team! Thomas Ian Nicholas did a good job playing the boy Henry. Daniel Stern couldn't of cast a better child actor to play that role. The rest of the cast gave good performances such as Gary Busey playing the player Rockie and Eddie Bracken did a good job playing the Cubs owner. I also liked John Candy's hilarious performance as the announcer for the games. And Daniel Stern also gave a good performance as the goofy player Phil Berquist. In my opinion that's one of his greatest and funniest roles next to Marv in the Home Alone movie series. Filled with hilarious scenes and a great story and great characters Rookie of the Year is a Great Baseball Movie that any Baseball fan could love. Young or Old. I give it a 10 out of 10.,/review/rw5765765/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2002,Agent10,4," Cheesy family fun
","See Thomas Ian Nicholas in a film before forever becoming known as a pervert in American Pie. As a kids movie, this movie hits a homerun. Consider many of the aspects: a goofy central character, a bad to good storyline, and supporting members who seem rather believable in their traits and actions (except for Daniel Stern of course).",/review/rw5765765/?ref_=tt_urv

26 September 2014,StevePulaski,6," A mostly-vanilla film existing in an already overblown genre
","Rookie of the Year is just about as genial as a baseball movie of the nineties can be before it becomes a tad too grating for my personal tastes. The film dances on a line between being too concerned with ridiculous humor and too fixated on creating a sentimental environment that, between those two things, has difficultly really making one enjoy the fun of the baseball game at hand.",/review/rw5765765/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2002,satterwh,8," Good family film
","OK, it's not the Wizard of Oz, but this is a fun film. Henry (I'm not even going to *TRY* to spell the last name) lives every boy's dream - playing major league baseball. In some ways, though, the *WAY* he played was what made the film. At no point did he become a 30 year old in a 12 yr old body... he behaved like a 12 year old on the field, having the fun that a kid would have. In some ways, this is the dream of the adults - to play the game like a kid again. I think that's what makes this film work. Thomas Nicholas was absolutely believable as the 12 yr old with the fast arm. Daniel Stern did an excellent job of directing this, keeping the fun in the film as well as the game. Watch Robert Gorman as Henry's friend; he's the loyal friend every kid wants. Stereotypes? You betch'um Red Ryder. Doesn't matter, they work in this context. Recommended; I gave it an 8.",/review/rw5765765/?ref_=tt_urv

","I thought it was a fantastically funny movie. I laughed so hard at time-it was a blast! I really enjoyed the idea of the movie. I had never picked up on such an idea as a young boy making it to the majors.. I imagine that it is an idea that many major leaguers had thought about before the movie was made. Is it why the Cubbies hardly ever make to the Series?? -because they got a soft spot for their fans? Anyway, the movie is a lot of fun. There isn't a whole lot you can do with such an idea, although I think it was done very well.",/review/rw5765765/?ref_=tt_urv

","Not people who ONCE were children in the 90s, but actual children living in the actual 90s. I was one of those kids, & I used to LOVE this movie; unfortunately, that love stayed back with that decade. This has the worst tendencies of a sports film: emotionally over-the-top, cheap plot mechanics, & an obnoxiously predictable story.
