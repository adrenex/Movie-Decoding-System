21 October 2019,jesser299,5," Had potential
","This show just didn't live up to how good it should have been.... Chris Pine. Love him. The lead actress... she started with promise, but I kept wondering when her outer fa√ßade would break and we'd begin to see genuine emotion (we never really did). Ultimately, it set up such an eerie, creepy mystery with real world inspiration, old Hollywood setting with awesome costumes and sets... but along the way, it totally lost my interest. I was curious enough to see the ending, so I stuck with the limited series to the end. But it felt like a mediocre show that should have been great.",/review/rw4678665/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2019,eddieo1969,8," Very promising start - I just wish I hadn't researched the real people
","I enjoyed the first episode. It sets out two line that we know will connect. Both lines have sympathetic lead characters Pine a down on his luck reporter, who could be a composite of lead character in the best Noir films. Eisley is the poor, lost, innocent soul, adopted as a baby and brought up in the countryside trying to connect with her natural (and rich) family in LA.",/review/rw4678665/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2019,Ed-Shullivan,10," 1960's film noir is so mesmerizing I wish I could binge watch it through to the end
",The first episode was over as soon as it seemed to start. This story is so intriguing that it will surely capture a significant viewing audience and be the main conversation at the company water cooler. For us baby boomers the 1960's were a magical yet simpler time. The producers have done an excellent job with recreating the Reno Nevada and Los Angeles city landscapes as well as the fashion styles of the 1960's era.,/review/rw4678665/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2019,janmanuel2,5," Soooo slow...
","I can barely keep watching this. The first episodes are mainly the young woman walking around looking at things with wide eyes. I like dramas that are well written. I'm not one of those people that require constant action. This is not one of those good dramas. I feel it is poorly done and over hyped. I'd rather watch an older Black Dahlia movie or documentary. My husband agrees it's slow but wants to see it through, so I guess I shall keep watching. My 5 stars may decrease.",/review/rw4678665/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2019,Vivkon,9," No roots
","This is a fascinating story of revealation: the mystery of an adoption centered on one girl. The TV series is rife with striking elements of romance and detective, chicanery. Acting is enjoyable and the storyline is quite promising. It looks like knowing the roots can be dangerous for truth-seekers, but fascinating for show viewers.",/review/rw4678665/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2019,drjgardner,3," Fails to produce
",I waited until the series was over to evaluate it. There were definitely some appealing aspects to the series - film noir on TV. But as the series continued it seemed to be filling time. The last episode was particularly disappointing but I won't give anything away.,/review/rw4678665/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2019,bryanwoolman,9," Very Well Done
","Series successfully uses actual people and events to craft a story that could easily span a dozen series. Not all of the events happen in the order they did in history, but the writer has skillfully put them together to make a six unit masterpiece. Excellent period piece (sets, cars, buildings) and very well acted.",/review/rw4678665/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2019,sethompson-80775,8," PAINSTAKINGLY SLOW...but excellent acting.
","I am surprised by the bad reviews. The acting is superb, and the setting and clothing DO match the lower class population from the sixties era. Someone commented that there was no segregation after 1959....HELLO??? The Civil Rights Movement BEGAN around 1958-59 and there was A LOT of work that still needed to be done.
It's an excellent program, I just hope that the pace will quicken as it moves along.",/review/rw4678665/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2019,TxMike,," Mostly true story of Fauna Hodel and her unusual childhood.
",My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. It is about 5 hours + or - and presented in 6 episodes. We typically watched 2 per night. As is the norm with these mini series a good 2 to 3 hours of programming is stretched to have it fill 6 episodes so it often gets a bit slow. Still it is a very captivating story from the 1960s Los Angeles.,/review/rw4678665/?ref_=tt_urv

",Could have condensed this into a 2 hour movie and it would have been much better. Most of the scenes were of the girl slowly walking around wide eyed.,/review/rw4678665/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2019,ReluctantPuppet,6," Could Have Been Something Very Special ...
","An engaging subject coupled with a strong cast, I Am The Night oozed potential.
Unfortunately the end product has been diluted to the point where even thought there are only six episodes it feels stretched out. And rather than the mature/adult tone the story merits, we're presented with I Am The Lite. It's Alien Covenant when it could have been Alien. I wouldn't recommend against watching, simply to go in with low expectations that way you won't be disappointed.",/review/rw4678665/?ref_=tt_urv

","Reel Review: I Am the Night
Producer Patty Jenkins
Starring: Chris Pine, India Eisley, Jefferson Mays
A new limited series from filmmaker Patty Jenkins (Monster, Wonder Woman) detailing the real life events surrounding the infamous 1947 murder of Elizabeth Short otherwise known as The Black Dahlia. Next to the Ripper murders the Black Dahlia has captured the imaginations of armchair detectives through the decades and is equally as infamous.
The first of six episodes premiered tonight on TNT starring Chris Pine as a down and out news reporter who has fallen from grace after rubbing certain powerful parties the wrong way after running an expose on one George Hodel who is very well connected. George is believed by many including his son (a former LAPD detective) to be the slayer of Elizabeth Short.
A young woman raised all her life in Nevada comes to learn that her past is a lie and that George Hodel is her grandfather and leaves home in search of her roots to the chagrin of her adoptive mother. The episode ends with the young woman making it to LA seeking to reconnect with her grandfather and journalist Jay Singletary once again set upon the trail of Dr. Hodel and the secrets that he may be hiding.
This is episode one of six and is planting the seeds of what is to come in the series going forward. Chris Pine as usual gives a stellar performance as the disgraced journalist brings both his comedic chops and a sense of tragedy to his character. India Eisley is also great as a young woman whose life is turned upside down and the ending of tonight's episode has me stoked as to what is to come this season.
I am a long time true crime buff and the Black Dahlia case is one that has fascinated me for a very long time. Especially in recent years George Hodel's name has figured prominently as the preeminent suspect in the murder of Elizabeth Short. Just google the name George Hodel and you can read a little bit about some of the accusations lobbed against him that will make your stomach turn. If your a student of true crime or just a fan of mystery thrillers then chances are I Am the Night will probably be to your liking.",/review/rw4678665/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2019,purrlgurrl,2," Stuff it and roast it for Thanksgiving
","Hammy performance by Chris Pine or maybe his character was far too broadly written. Anyway, his scenery chewing got old fast. He's been a lot better elsewhere.",/review/rw4678665/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2019,bb-d-19690,5," Lacks
","Though the acting is good, the fact that the program moves at a snails pace to try to create a lengthy story line where none exists is just sad. Might have been better as a 90 minute movie.",/review/rw4678665/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2019,ghcheese,6," What a let down
","I watched all seven episodes. And I was getting excited for the ending to reveal some amazing conspiracy. It didn't. It left you sitting there going ""huh"". So I looked up some things. And guess what? Non of it fit this story at all. Do your self a favor. Don't watch this. I give it a six because for six episodes I was intrigued. It was the final episode that killed the whole thing.",/review/rw4678665/?ref_=tt_urv

",I bailed mid-episode 4. Enough was enough. Having read a few other reviews by people who said they researched the real people this show is based on spoiled the story for them inspired me to stop watching this excruciating mess and just google the actual people.

",I think Chris Pine is a great actor and good in this but his talent is wasted. Each episode is slow and boring. There isn't one episode that has you on your seat in anticipation. The Fauna character is dumb as dirt and you just can't like her. This could have been a good movie but it's a boring mini series.,/review/rw4678665/?ref_=tt_urv

","Like many I have heard of the black dahlia case, but I have never heard this side of the story before, and wow, let me tell you this show is by far the best way to find out about it. I don't understand other reviewers being upset with the acting because I thought both Pine & the main character were outstanding (not even a fan of Pine before this). Please don't listen to the bad reviews & watch for yourself. After the first episode I was hooked, and things started to really take off by the second episode.",/review/rw4678665/?ref_=tt_urv

","This show had me hooked from the beginning and I found the characters to be rich in depth and detail. A suspenseful portrayal of a real life story. Anyone who says the story is slow must not have the aptitude to appreciate the emotionally-driven direction given to weave and engage viewers through different time periods and societal divisions. It isn't meant to be a ""flash in the pan"" movie-thriller most people lap up these days. It's meant to be an experience, to be savored. A throwback to Film Noir. A+",/review/rw4678665/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2019,ruirebgamboa,8," Alert: they spoiled it at the end of each episode.
","Loved the first two episodes, mainly the raymond chandler like ambience. There is a problem with the actors: Pine will never be a Marlowed style character and India, well she just isn't too good at it. The rest is great. But at the end of each episode they show photos of the real life characters they are portraying. Obviously, in this day in age, we all go and google it and, almost without wanting, we come to see what happened and the rest of the series is seriously spoiled.",/review/rw4678665/?ref_=tt_urv
