20 March 2020,ulex_stovetop,6," Fun but too complex
","A great disappoint when compared to MK9 and MKX. I enjoyed the story fair enough (good but not great), but everything else is a bit lack-luster. The combat is too different from the other games to feel natural to a older player. They also intoduce a million different currencies that add a far too complex kyot that makes it confusing to unlock anything. simply too much going on to be enjoyable I prefer the more streamlined and focused a design f the previous games. Sad to have waited years to get Spawn in a modern nighting game and to finally get it I'm a game I don't like playing. Should have been in Injustice 2...",/review/rw5001401/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2019,dj-83761,4," Disappointing
",So disappointed the roster sucks and the put zero effort into making the old fans happy while giving new fans something cool the attacks to me feel sluggish for some reasons and this game right now is below my usual mortal kombat standards it sucks bad don't buy just stick with the old games for example 25 characters are you kidding me right now 25 really ? Now take a look at a mortal kombat game that's more than 10 years old mortal kombat armageddon the roster is like 65 or something are you kidding me your saying that a game from ten years ago and have 60+ characters and a modern game only has 25 pathetic dude.,/review/rw5001401/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2021,maazhamid-87215,10," Best out there!
","Realistic graphics, addition of popular characters, more gruesome Wallpaper-making fatalities, and excellent fights. Its complexity and loads of different things you can do makes it truly amazing. Negative reviews in this aspect can't stand a little difficulty. Story is not as good as the previous ones, but not as bad as people make it. For most fans and newcomers, it should be a delight to play!!!",/review/rw5001401/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2021,ryanwalton-39615,8," Great Combat System, Overly Complex Storyline
",The general fighting system matches that of all Mortal Kombat Games and is enjoyable as graphics have greatly improved over the years. Fatalities are on top form as always. Gameplay generally is really great.,/review/rw5001401/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2019,justin-fencsak,8," 27 years later, still the best fighting game made in America...
","When Mortal Kombat first came out in 1992, it was controversial at the time yet became a game changer in an era of fighting games that began with Street Fighter II and has evolved to include Tekken and others from around the world. Nowadays you can play MK online and beat friends.",/review/rw5001401/?ref_=tt_urv

",I enjoyed the game and love the violent style but i found the game pretty slow in the way he did combo and multiples punch. It lack of dynamics clearly. I enjoyed the finisher also but for me it lack of something in the gameplay it lack of dynamics.,/review/rw5001401/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2021,johnnyrcook,4," Pretty garbage
","This game has major issues. First, the game is really slow. Second, the game has unbalanced hit boxes. Third, the game focuses on spamming projectiles, unblockable moves, and ridiculous op moves such as Sheeva stomp and Jade in general. Fourth, the game caters to bad players rewarding simple moves with huge damage such as crushing blows and fatal blows. The game is a copy cat of injustice 2 and promotes back dashing all game. Fifth, the game promotes poking, which is super annoying and not fun. Sixth, the combos don't come through as you enter them which is highly frustrating and pathetic on the game. The only good thing about this game are the graphics and brutalities. MkX outshines this game without even question. People want the gameplay to be fun and challenging. If someone beat you at MkX, they were generally better. On Mk11, you may get beat by a terrible player using simple moves. The game isn't fun and is a huge let down given MK9 and MkX preceding it. 4 out of 10 and that is being nice. Collapse",/review/rw5001401/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2020,carobertson95,10," An Epic Story
","Ignore the bad reviews. I don't understand how ""fans"" of the series can play the other games then say this one suck. I have played every mortals kombat btw. The story alone is enough reason to buy the game, its incredibly epic with an extremely satisfying ending. The fatalities are filled with gore as always but a lot more creative than MK10. This game to me has been better than the last 2 Mortal Kombats although I loved 9 this one takes the cake in my eyes. But if anything this game just makes those 2 better because of how well it ties them all together. If you truly love mortal kombat then this game will fulfill your every need for vicious epic conquest.",/review/rw5001401/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2021,cpinsent,3," Looks great! But lacks fun
","I admit, the game looks beautiful. But the fun factor has been sacrificed. Compare it to the mk9 and mkx, huge user entertainment loss. Stiff complex combos and the strange annoying ""freeze frame"" fatalities leave the long time fans of the franchise bored and uninterested. I've read hundreds of posts from people who've purchased mk11 and didn't buy the ""aftermath "" update simply because they didn't like the game play....to a point where they didn't care about the story!",/review/rw5001401/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2021,Master_Strange,8," Amazing Graphics and Animations
","MK11 is so much fun to play, The story mode is good and I liked how each chapter made you play as a different character. My favorite characters to play in MK11 are Noob Saibot and Erron Black. Erron Black is my personal favorite to play as because I think he is so much fun. His combos and special moves are insane. Something I really liked about this game is customization, You can customize your character even more than before with skins, abilities, and augmentation. I had so much fun playing MK11 and I highly recommend it to any fan of the Mortal Kombat franchise.",/review/rw5001401/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2019,AnkasaurusRex,8," Almost Amazing!
","So like i say in the title this game is almost amazing.
I'll start with the story.
The story i really did love, could of been longer but they length it was was still fine, love how it continues on from MKX (as expected) but i was happily surprised to find out that it wasn't just going to be VS Kitana and Liu Kang Like how MKX ended, Was great to see the new characters, Even better to see some MK9 ones back!! Sad to see other characters gone, but all in all i really did enjoy the story, there's really nothing about it i didn't like.
Gameplay:
The Gameplay is great as always, like a few of the changes made, such as Offensive and Defensive metter bar, I don't know how i feel about the X-rays being changed, i mean i like that its only at the end and you can only do 1 but i feel that the fact that X-rays got split into ""Fatal Blow"" and ""Crushing Blows"" kinda takes away some of its new ages galorey that 9 and X had with its greyed out background and i though the reason why it was called and X-Ray was cause it showed more than just the outer layer of skin and yeah it still dose that but ""Crushing blow?"" it just doesn't seem right. I don't mind that its a slower game and tbh i didn't really notice at first till i realize i could 'run'. but that it for that gameplay, still love it.
Customisation: When playing MKX i thought back to armageddon and though how amazing would it be if mk11 brought back Kreate-a-fighter, It almost did! started seeing trailers for mk11 and i couldn't help but wonder , just trying to imagine all the ways you could do it in this day 'n' age, what i got wasn't what i hoped for but still great!! the variations on mkx were the best idea to keep things fresh and the fact that you can make your own is amazing, not being able to just have every move it the roaster was a good move and the gear just make it that much better. Now i do love the idea of skins but... now hear me out on this one... alot of them i feel are kinda 'off' like for example that fact that Sub-Zero can wear Red... and Jade wearing blue i mean it is cool and what now but i just feel that all that random coloured skins could of been better, once again use sub-zero for example instead of the red skins and orange skins that could've used a skin from a previous game X,9, Decp, mk3, same with scorpion, i just feel that those skin slots could have been better used on different skins not just a pallet swap, but that's just me .
On the note of customising your character i didn't think that unlocking all the gear pieces and skins etc wasn't gonna be so.. slow? for lack of a different word, but being in the krypt is great! kinda reminds me of shaolin monks lol
DLC:
God damn i really they dont do they same thing that did with X with all the other characters, i mean i think i saw somewhere that they were popular idk but that fact that (Alien,Predator,Jason & LeatherFace) were all in X was i mean yeah 9 had freddy and/or kratos but 4? Especially when other characters in the story were not playable such as Rain, Fujin, Sereena, Baraka and Frost, normal smoke, night wolf etc, speaking of which once again cyrax and sektor? not playable, idk if its cause the just gonna use them as dlc instead being better and put new people in that you haven't seen yet or just forget about them like mkx,but i just think actual mk character deserve to be in the roster more than others, But yeah i hope if they do to a none MK character i do hope it's only 1 or two,
Lastly
Character Design:
I do Like a lot of the new models, but i feel a lot of there outfits were better in MKX and even some models like Kano etc, most of they faces and expressions are just amazing! but the clothing, and what not like i get MKX was a lot darker (which is one of the things i love about it) but still could of made it a bit less.. i don't know, cheery.. lol prime example (Kano,-Normal Kitana,Jax and a few more. They did the same thing with zelda twilight princess, dark seems more detailed the next up was skyward sword and it went back to looking cartoony, just seems abit like a step backwards i guess but don't get me wrong i still love it all haha,",/review/rw5001401/?ref_=tt_urv

",So think Mortal Kombat 11 on the Nintendo Switch is great. There are a few problems about the game. When I go into towers it sometimes lags The game may lag a few times but overall I think the Nintendo Switch version is great. The graphics may not look the best but I think they're alright.
