27 July 2006,dr_foreman,10," Simply a great drama...
","I waste a lot of time reviewing cute but rubbishy science fiction and horror films on this site. I'm a bit out of practice with watching, and critiquing, actual drama! But of course, I still realize that the key to great drama is the characters - and they make this epic Italian miniseries-turned-movie work, and work beautifully at that.",/review/rw0988624/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2008,nturner,10," Long and Wonderful
","No, the number of minutes is no typo. This film is over six and a half hours long. But as Roger Ebert says, ""I dropped outside of time and was carried along by the narrative flow; when the film was over, I had no particular desire to leave the theater, and would happily have stayed another three hours."" Of course, I was watching in the comfort of my home but I agree completely with Mr. Ebert.",/review/rw0988624/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2004,Sinnerman,," The span of a lifetime in mere 360 minutes. Nice.
","Man, this 6 hour Italian drama gives soap opera a very good name. Saw the film at this year's Singapore International Film Festival, whose organisers were thankfully intuitive enough to endeavour such challenging programming.",/review/rw0988624/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2005,harry_tk_yung,," Best of cinema
","Not necessarily THE best cinematic experience I've ever had (which will always be reserved for LOTR), ""Best of Youth"" is unquestionably among the top few.",/review/rw0988624/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2005,flipgirl38,," Six Hours Long, Six Hours Deep
","The Best of Youth is a wonderfully scripted, acted, and visually stunning film that will sweep you off your feet and into the lives of an Italian family as they go through the trials and tribulations of life. The film's main focus is on two brothers, Nicola and Matteo Catiti whose personalities are as different as night and day yet is also immediately apparent that these two love each other very much. Nicola is the younger, free spirited and philosophical brother while Matteo is more outspoken, with a hot temper and closed personality.",/review/rw0988624/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2010,bandw,10," Be happy for its length
","I liked this so well that my first reaction after having watched it was to go back and watch it again. And that is what I did. As with most any good movie, a second viewing is more rewarding than the first, particularly if reading subtitles has been required.",/review/rw0988624/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2003,Oleg Sidorenko,10," A treasure - 6 moving hours of forgetting yourself
","Having just returned at 2 am from a festival showing of the movie that started at 5:30, I still can think of nothing but looking for anything and everything about this exceptional film that I came across more or less by accident. I can only sum up two points: it is an excellent yet easy-going overview of recent Italian history, and a truly moving, in an unbanal and unstereotypical, unpopcorny way, movie about the value of friendship, closeness, family. This film makes you want to live, to cherish the people you love and to be aware of the consequences of your acts. City living makes sour cynics out of teenage optimists (I'd count myself in until now), and this one is a lesson of keeping the best of yourself throughout life. A true inspiration! Bravo.",/review/rw0988624/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2005,Travis_Bickle01,10," Beautiful and touching family story
","I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago. Actually, you can't call it a movie because it's much more than that, it is a kind of mini-series. ""La Meglio Gioventu"" tells the story of two brothers: Matteo and Niccola. It starts when they are both about 18 years old; two young idealist who want to discover and change the world. What follows is partly Italian history, but mainly the personal history of the two brothers, growing up and finding their way through life.",/review/rw0988624/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2005,delphine090,10," Beautiful Film
","It's hard not to feel like an ""easy"" grader to give this film a 10, given that it is the very simple story of a family over 4 decades, no quirky writing or the eccentricities of ""indie"" films - just beautiful scenery, characters that move us and that we care about, and a sweet and believable story. The acting is excellent.",/review/rw0988624/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2005,DOMENICO_SOLDANI,10," If the perfect movie exist, it is: EXCELLENT
","This is not only a story, this is a practically perfect mix of history and story, of private and public, of feelings,love,life. I believe in everybody who loves CINEMA there is a dream, to make a movie in which the story run like the life, in which we could feel like when, children in our bed, waiting to be catch by the sleep, we listen the tales from our parents and everything seems more real than reality. This movie is the evidence that sometimes the life could be translate in an universal language, where everybody could feel a part of himself on the screen. LA MEGLIO GIOVENTU' is the story of a family, four young brothers, along the last forty years in Italy (but it could be everywhere). There are a psychiatrist, a policeman, a lawyer and an housewife, but there are also their relatives, friends, in poor words there is the LIFE. I would suggest to see this long tale, you will feel better.",/review/rw0988624/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2006,jotix100,10," Two brothers
","Marco Tullio Giordana deserves praise for bringing this saga about two brothers in Italy that spans a few decades and paints a picture about the country. Mr. Giordana and the writers of this series made for television, Sandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli, painted a rich canvas of modern Italy as events of the last forty years surface in this gripping tale of two brothers and the people whose lives they touched.",/review/rw0988624/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2006,gradyharp,10," An Epic Film Rich in History, Wondrously Performed
",La Meglio gioventù (THE BEST OF YOUTH) is a spellbinding drama that sweeps the viewer through Italian history from 1966 through 2003 as distilled in the lives of one family. Writers Sandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli have created a screenplay that is both informative to those of us who did not live this period in Italian political disturbance and simultaneously passionate in the creation of a group of people surrounding two brothers who propel the story with heartrending power.,/review/rw0988624/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2005,frankgaipa,10," Ticks and Tocks: Wish-Fulfillment
","The gist of my too-long ramble below is there probably is, at least definitively within the film, no answer to the ""Why?"" of Matteo, and that Nicola as he ages increasingly embraces the status quo. Blame inevitable age, if you like, but it doesn't happen to their mother.",/review/rw0988624/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2006,eapplebaum,10," I'm proud of the filmmaker
","I am not of Italian descent however, I have lived and loved and experienced Italy with an Italian heart and soul. I besides having studies film, worked in film production for many years and have a masters in psychotherapy (MSW), I would say this film was brilliant. Sure, it has it's holes. However, Italy has not produced a better piece of film work since....the 1980's. it is very difficult to create a mini series which engages and tells the nuance of the big picture in such a poetic way. Yes, the family seemed to have been hit hard with all the drama of the times, but, there were things this family did NOT experience where others did and that was good. it showed the integrity of the filmmakers to maintain true character continuity and development was consistent.",/review/rw0988624/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2009,yris2002,10," When Italy offers something to be proud of!
","As I was about to write my review, I was very positively surprised at seeing the wide, and I would say worldwide success of this awesome Italian ""movie"": reviewers from all over Europe and across the ocean prove that when a product is intelligently-crafted it is able to cross borders, even though it's deeply rooted in Italian history and could sound a little unfamiliar to a foreign audience. Most comments consist, indeed, of positive words of praise in favour of this movie: emotionally engaging, never boring, despite the long time-run, authentic, genuine, poetic, finely characterised, wonderfully acted, sober, delicate, sensitive, intelligent, never banal, captivating, enjoyable at every age: simply great.

18 March 2005,philip_vanderveken,9," Just beautiful
","I've always been in love with Italy. In my opinion it may be the prettiest European country I know (I'm European myself and I've seen most of the other countries, so I know what I'm talking about). I like its buildings, its landscapes, its history, its people and its culture. So when being able to see an Italian movie, or should I call it a mini-series, that deals with all these aspects of Italian life, I knew I had to watch it.",/review/rw0988624/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2015,jdeureka,10," Ten+ Out of Ten+ for Best of Youth. Why?
","You need to exhaust a dictionary of adjectives to do justice to the delicacy, the nuanced quality, of this film. It has a breathless way of dealing with the most essential human emotions. Nothing is vulgar or tawdry. There is a sublime sense of place (which could only be Italy -- but not only in this time period). This is a must see film because it sees into the viewer. It exposes and bears witness to our common human experience -- with perfectly light and deep paintbrush strokes that move gracefully unrushed. It is, by far, one of the most generous films I have ever seen because it bares the soul of emotions and thoughts without casting judgement on them. For lack of a better phrase, it is overflowing with love. But not cloying or sticky or possessive ""love"". Because ""Best of Youth"" teaches that life lived at its best is not this way. Life is the vitality of love one knows in youth and should keep forever. See it. Thank you.",/review/rw0988624/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2015,evito1,10," The best movie I've ever seen
","Without a doubt the best movie I've ever seen. The six hours of film (plus the emotional catharsis after) were well worth it. The film slowly but surely sucks you into the story of the two brothers, Nicola and Matteo, and the sometimes shocking and unexpected events taking place in their lives, against the background of Italy's lively past.",/review/rw0988624/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2006,erginero,10," It is touching from heart
","This movie really touched me. I can even say that it is the best movie I have ever seen. On the beginning you have a man with great enthusiasm, then he gets more serious because of his job and his middle ages, an then later... There are many unforgettable scenes. There is history, love, romance, adventure, psychology, drama, fun and everything. The scenario and the acting is perfect, especially Giulia (Sonia Bergamasco) and Nicola (Luigi Lo Cascio). I was sad when the movie ended, I could watch 6 more hours. Maybe this is a personal effect because of the wonderful scenario. Anyway you can witness a complete life story from the beginning till the end. The director was very careful and attentive, I haven't seen anything wrong. Thanks to everybody worked on that movie.",/review/rw0988624/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2009,wwillems,10," Best movie of the decade
","The best movie of the past decade and one of the best I have ever seen. I watched this movie for the second time and was as touched as I was the first time. Too bad this movie has not made it into the top 250. Even though this is a six hour movie time flew by as I grew sympathy for all the different characters in this movie. It is a roller-coaster of emotions, I loved the cinematography, the shots of Rome and Florence are simply beautiful, the acting is superb. ",/review/rw0988624/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2006,Ichuta,10," Perfezione
","It's 1AM on a weekday, and more than a year after watching this movie for the third time, I'm still haunted by it, like an overwhelming memory that won't fade. I think I know what it is: it is all the profound humanity that this film projects, in its pure, real, obtainable form, through its different stories, its passions, its formidable characters - especially the one of Nicola, whom it is so easy to love and identify with.",/review/rw0988624/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2004,Patrik E,10," A joy to watch
","I've just finished watching this gripping film. I was on the Gothenbeug Film festival, but I did not see it. The 6,5 hours were a daunting prospect. On Swedish telly the divided in into 4 parts which were shown 4 days in a row. It is one of those series where one is longing for the next episode, I found myself pondering about the film, the characters all day. So many things has been said already in other reviews which I don't have to repeat I just say watch this lowly very slowly unfolding slice of life and Italian history. If it doesn't move you you will have to have a heart of stone. Excellent acting, wonderful photos, lots of atmosphere.....",/review/rw0988624/?ref_=tt_urv
