10 August 2021,hilary89,9," The Gen-Z Indian Experience
","My family is from Eastern Oklahoma (Choctaw Nation) and save for the lack of Okie accents, this series is so spot on. I can't recall any media that frames the Indian experience with such raw humor (impeccably delivered by this young crew, btw). Most depictions of Native American life is either pure tragedy and destitution, or an elevation of the ""noble savage"" trope. To be clear, the driving circumstances here are the very real challenges of poverty and crime that plagues rural Indian communities. But the comedic approach in this series puts these kids in the mainstream and makes their lives widely relatable. Native kids really are just like all other American kids from marginalized, minority backgrounds - with the same attitudes, hustles and pop culture references. In a lot of ways this show is unique to the Indian experience, but it could easily be translated to a black inner city, or an immigrant setting. Basically, anyone and everyone can and should enjoy this show.",/review/rw8638409/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2021,stefstars,8," Representation Done Right
","This is one of VERY few shows out there that represents a community that has long been overlooked or stereotyped by the entertainment industry and it's not in an artificial, forced way. Why ? Because the creators and majority of the writers on this show are of Native American / Indigenous backgrounds. As a result the storytelling feels natural, it comes across in an authentic way, and it's not preachy in the ""please don't cancel us"" way that a lot of recent ""representation matters"" shows are guilty of.",/review/rw8638409/?ref_=tt_urv

",Dallas Goldtooth is the standout here. His wry satire of every mystical Indian stereotype.,/review/rw8638409/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2021,owen-watts,8," Pop Pop Pop
","With a wild Taika-tinged swagger, Reservation Dogs arrived as a fully formed concept - giving a sharp caricature of contemporary native culture with buckets of wit, personality and sincerity. The whole ensemble here are remarkable, and it feels tremendously fresh. In its efforts to cram everything in right out the gate (or perhaps due to circumstances during filming) there are an abnormal amount of ""bottle episodes"" or side character tangents that confound the central narrative drive a little. This is something other comedies may have only felt confident doing in their third of fourth series - but Rez Dogs has few contemporaries and the characters are easily strong enough to make this otherwise alienating move work. It also feels a little breathless with references, but when this is the first proper stab at authentic representation for millions of people who have been culturally sidelined on TV since the invention of the medium you can't blame the creative team for having a lot to say. Legitimately can't wait for more.",/review/rw8638409/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2021,gordonrm-31460,10," Totally on point
","Native here, raised on the rez. I won't say this is 100% accurate because it's obviously a caricature in some ways, but they get so much right, especially the slang. I found it hilarious that the old warrior character truly represents Native humor in a way I've never really seen before in pop culture, just really fast, double barreled, and then suddenly drab. The sets are very close to real life. I watched these first two episodes thinking ""I've been there,"" or ""I've done that."" Probably the best glimpse into rez life since Smoke Signals which is a huge tip of the cap.",/review/rw8638409/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2021,wintuguy,10," Hilarious!!
",I don't find it offensive like some people do and I'M NATIVE. This show is hilarious and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I get all the jokes and it has me rolling. I can't wait to watch another episode.,/review/rw8638409/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2022,thejdrage,9," This is brilliant on so many levels
","First off - I am an old white lady who bypassed this for a while until I saw a trailer and was intrigued. I cannot believe this isn't sitting along ""Resident Alien"" and ""Better Call Saul"" it is so well done and so beautifully off center. It also has several of my favorite native actors in it - both young and old(er).",/review/rw8638409/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2021,Pukeonthestreet,9," So many great people invovled
",From the actors to the writers to the director. This show is destined for greatness. Catch it now before it blows up.,/review/rw8638409/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2021,shashrvacai,8," love this show
","No fizz and jazz as often observed on Prime time TV. It has some great actors, I'm actually looking forwards to all the kids careers. Simple stories, simple build up with well written characters.",/review/rw8638409/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2021,mcc-08445,8," FUNNY, CREATIVE, SMART, WELL DONE
","First impression is everything. Watched the first 2 episodes and decided to continue. It is different and thoughtful. Good directing, good acting and good script. Highly recommended.",/review/rw8638409/?ref_=tt_urv

17 August 2021,rfadam,9," Based on 3 episodes
","I look forward to new episodes coming out each week. Main complaint is that the episodes are short, since I could use more. The acting is superb, the humor on point. Hunt for the Wilderpeople is one of my favorite movies so perhaps it's no surprise that I really enjoy this series. Sometimes a show comes along that just fits what I need at a particular moment, and this show is it.",/review/rw8638409/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2021,saiken-30341,8," A lot of heart
","What a gem. The characters are fully realized humans with meaningful relationships. Lots of characters to cheer for. Good music, humor and a bit of adventure. I liked it a bunch.",/review/rw8638409/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,crimeagainstcreation,10," Sup, White Jesus?
","If you thought a series from a First Nation reservation would be all about social historical tragedy, broken culture and alcoholism, think again. Yes, it's kinda dark, red, what ever, and it's also a comedy, not hilariously funny, and it got loads of ironical distance and sarcasm, but still it's dead serious, like the best humor always should be.",/review/rw8638409/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2021,starry_oceans,10," Fantastic and Funny
",I highly recommend this show. It is hilarious and touching at the same time. Character development is strong and the acting is great. Definitely worth your time to watch it. And then rewatch because it is so good!,/review/rw8638409/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2021,fvga_dix,10," So good it hurts
","I the real question that comes to mind; Are they even aware of the masterpiece they are creating?! Or could it be just as simple as keeping it real? By far the realest show I have ever seen, the only thing that would come close is 'The Grizzlies'. ""Life is comedy from afar and a tragedy up close"". So funny at times, well written and great acting. Instantly fell in love with Willie. Solid 10 any day of the week.",/review/rw8638409/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2021,oscar_chip,10," This is my Rez story...just not in the details
","I love it...They got so much right. Not just the accents but themes of wanting out while needing to protect those you care about. The spirit guide is hilarious! I get everyone's story. I love the Willow references. They have an Elora Danan and my baby sister is named Kiaya after Willow's wife. I remember Ice Cube saying that he wrote Friday because while the place he grew up was surely Boyz n the Hood, it was also a good time with good people and this resembles that same sentiment.",/review/rw8638409/?ref_=tt_urv

31 August 2021,jessicawinston-66911,10," Come And Get Your Love
","Aho! From the first episode I was hooked. It's funny, relatable, & music throughout is nice! This show is a gem and I want more. The latest episode they played Come and Get Your Love by Redbone, through all these years I thought was a black band, Lolly Vasquez has a soulful voice. Beautiful, just watch.",/review/rw8638409/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2021,glenhart-04677,9," Taika Waititi back to his roots.
","Initial cinematography reminds me of 'Boy', which in my opinion is Taika's best work. It's great how this series show cases the native American sense of humour and their dry wit which sort of aligns with Taika's.",/review/rw8638409/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,cherold,6," often aimless and occasionally terrific

","Wonderful, heartfelt, and irreverently funny comedy about life on the Rez. Perfectly captures the universal experiences of youth--the hopes and dreams, and the intense, chaotic emotions, but places them in a wholely unique environment.",/review/rw8638409/?ref_=tt_urv
