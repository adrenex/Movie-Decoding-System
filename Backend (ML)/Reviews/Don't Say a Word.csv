20 April 2019,rogerdob,1," Totally 100% Illogical!
","I know that we, as moviegoers, must often suspend belief in order to enjoy movies. However this film pushes the viewer completely over the limits. Let's count some of them...1) there are millions and millions of dopplegangers of us living in tunnels below us, 2) they were created by the US government, 3) their only source of food are rabbits!, 4) they are all dressed in red clothing (who made the clothing?), 5) no one, absolutely no one, thinks of or suggests getting a gun to protect themselves (such an action would have solved the problem and ended the film early). This film is an embarrasment to horror films...even some of the worst horror films attempt a reason that is somewhat believeable for their premise. Move this film into the discount bin of DVD's at Walmart.",/review/rw4742468/?ref_=tt_urv

","When Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) returns to Santa Cruz, the site of a childhood trauma, with her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and children Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex), she finds her family stalked by a group of doppelg√§ngers intent on doing them harm.",/review/rw4742468/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2020,Leofwine_draca,3," Not for me
","While I thought Jordan Peele's GET OUT was acceptable albeit overrated, US is another story altogether. It's a boringly pretentious 'survival horror' type story filled with annoying characters and rote action sequences. Things begin with an elaborate setup which lasts half an hour but feels twice as long; I felt my eyes dropping at this point. Then the action begins, and it takes the form of those predictable 'home invasion' style thrillers in which the protagonists somehow manage to keep surviving overwhelming odds. Plenty of violence and shrieking, but nothing in the way of originality, while the larger plotline is simply ridiculous. I appreciate the efforts to make an allegory and how realism isn't necessarily a priority, but this just felt like nonsense to me. Then there's the dragged-out twist ending, which anyone can guess from the beginning. Bad times.",/review/rw4742468/?ref_=tt_urv

7 April 2019,annieboo-41078,1," So stupid
","Started off good until the doppelganger started talking. I felt like they tired way too hard for it to be scary. The music they chose was scary but didn't match the movie. The doppelganger son, acting like a dog was just plain stupid. Not scary at all. The plot made zero sense. There was no point to this movie. I was literally laughing because it was so stupid, and not scary at all.",/review/rw4742468/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2019,One_slice_of_pizza,4," Let's Be Honest
","If the name wasn't Jordan Peele, you would have walked out of that theater. Most of the audience went to see US because of the amazing experience they had with the successful movie Get Out.",/review/rw4742468/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2019,ksmart73,6," A lot of hype, but not fully satisfying.
","I hate saying this, but this film is the product of when you've got incredible everything and an underdeveloped script. The concepts are great, but lose their value and appreciation because there is so much with so little explanation, leaving me with the impression that they were not completely thought-out.
Acting was incredible, cinematography, lighting, set design, and sound track were wonderful too! It's just that the script and story does not fully deliver. It's so conceptual that it loses horror, yet so rushed in execution that it loses coherence.",/review/rw4742468/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2019,The_Film_Auditor,7," Great idea, questionable execution...
","I am torn on whether or not I like the story of Us. Part of me really likes the originality of the idea and the subtle social commentary the film delivers; however, I felt that despite Us having an interesting idea, the execution led to a disjointed story that felt a bit scatterbrained. There were definitely parts of the film that were suspenseful and horrifying, but at the same time, other parts felt too over-explained or tropey. This leads to me having many unanswered questions about certain aspects and feeling like other aspects shouldn't have been explained at all to keep the mystery. I think the story is hard to talk about without spoiling it, but overall, I expected more from Jordan Peele's writing but did enjoy some of it.",/review/rw4742468/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2019,segesta65,6," Yeah, no. Not that good
","After Get Out I thought Jordan Peele might be the new Hitchcock. Now I think he is merely the new M Night Shyamalan. And that's not a compliment.
Slow moving, clever, full of holes, great acting, and frustrating.
Why did the Tethered seek revenge on their twins and not the unnamed people who did the cloning? Why did she marry that stupid oaf in the first place?",/review/rw4742468/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2019,nikosxen,5," most overhyped movie
","I am sure that this review is going to get a ton of down votes and I am pretty sure that all those 10/10 reviews are bot accounts (if you dont believe me check the profiles) so I wont spent much time analyzing the film. Many many plot holes,little substance and ultimately you have a movie with a weak script based on a good idea that takes itself way to seriously without achieving even half of what it promises. Get out worked that well because it didn't take itself that seriously and there was always an underlying tone of dark comedy to it. It gets a 5 because I liked the cinematography and I thought that the performances where actually quite good!",/review/rw4742468/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2019,searchanddestroy-1,4," Please let Us Get Out
","Yes, let us get out of this crap. This director seems to want to copy Night Shyamalan's work, but that's a total failure. Yes, I can't pevent myself to think about the director of GLASS and SPLIT, another way to film horror thu psychanalist way of presenting the topic. But I also admit that I am not a specialist of this kind of stuff. GET OUT was far better than US.",/review/rw4742468/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2019,umimelectric,3," Finally a film for plot-hole enthusiasts
","Unpopular opinion: this film is ridiculous. It makes little sense, it's inconsistent, unreasonable, cringe-worthy, and at times unintentionally comedic. No I'm not talking about the cheesy jokes that a family who should be traumatized still manages to utter in times of great duress, I'm referring to the poignant and dramatic moments of the film being an absolute laugh. I've seen budget-production indie flicks that were just as good as this story, if not better...simply put, it's a lot of hype over a very mediocre film.",/review/rw4742468/?ref_=tt_urv

22 June 2019,bob-the-movie-man,4," A film with dodgy voices.
","What a great film ""Get Out"" was. Jordan Peele's classic which unpeeled (sic) race relations in a wholly novel and horrifying way. Yes, the story was a bit 'out there' and unbelievable, but he pulled it off with great chutzpah.",/review/rw4742468/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2019,coopde-88684,6," Disappointed.
","Trailer was better than the movie. To me this movie just never takes off. It's a shame because there is some fantastic imagery and a wonderful theme lying underneath but in the end it can not overcome its plot holes and failed delivery of the message its trying to speak. It truly believes it's deeper than it is, but left me unfulfilled. Kind of lazy/rushed writing in my opinion. Kind of just throws a bunch of mediocre stuff at you without any real substance and expects the audience to give it purpose and deeper meaning in there own heads. Which is fine to do but to me this movie wasn't worthy of that merit of thought. You keep waiting for it to evolve but it just never does. Honestly can't believe critics are putting this on such a pedestal giving it such rave reviews.",/review/rw4742468/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2019,MiriamAF,3," Comedy not horror

18 April 2019,Goonie_BR,5," Disappointed
","I wanted to like this movie, I was so excited about the trailer and I like the idea behind it, it's very original... but it simply didn't happed. Although we can say that Jordan Peele is a filmmaker who thinks outside the box and brings important and strong subjects, I thought the movie was poorly developed. I need to believe in what I'm watching, but there are so many plot holes and inconsistencies that the whole experience was damaged. The metaphors are confusing, the explanations are flat and forced, the writing felt really lazy to me.
And to add, I thought the mix of comedy and horror, that can be made in very harmonic ways, was unbalanced. All the time the comedic moments came up to break the tension, so I was not able to get scared at all and I wanted to be.
Nevertheless, I'd like to point out the amazing acting of Lupyta. Her delivery is always intense and strong, no matter which character she is playing. And I hope Peele keeps his originality, but learns to develop better narratives in the future.",/review/rw4742468/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2019,thejilliebean16,," So much potential...so much confusion.
","I liked the movie a lot. I thought it was very well shot and very well acted, and I can appreciate Peele's subtle homages to previous horror films throughout. However, the story itself is very weak and a bit of a mess.",/review/rw4742468/?ref_=tt_urv

15 September 2019,pmtelefon,4," Heavy handed silliness.
","Someone should explain to writer/director Jordan Peele that ""Twilight Zone"" episodes were only thirty minutes long. They weren't two hours. Just like his earlier movie ""Get Out"", ""Us"" is a elongated ""Twilight Zone"". The first half hour or so of ""Us"" is painfully dull. After that the movie picks up but by the end it doesn't take us anywhere worth while. The cast is fine, I guess. The movie is not. I'm also not a fan of the horror movie ""twist"". I know people who love the ""twist"" but I like to enjoy a film's journey not it's contrived ""shock"" ending. I think the ""twist"" usually takes away more from the final product than it adds. That said, I didn't like the twist in ""Us"" either. It's just extra icing on a cake that wasn't too good to begin with.",/review/rw4742468/?ref_=tt_urv

25 March 2019,pacman-81,4," Pretty bad
","I struggled to like much in this. Good cast but performed badly in large parts with over acting to try and be scary being the worst thing.
The Plot started well and was intriguing but the more it went on on I actually found it laughable. By the time it hit a big a twist at the end I didn't care. Plus point of the film was the child actors were impressive.",/review/rw4742468/?ref_=tt_urv
