10 June 2018,generalmishmash-26055,3," Decent show, terrible season 4
","Show was pretty decent for season 1/2, did some things differently then the standard ER show and did them well. Season 3 had some issues but wasn't all that bad. Season 4 is just a mess. It's hitting all the negative tropes of an ER show, the story itself is all over the place and the ""big event"" for many of the episodes are just ludicrous. Sorry to see the series end on such a sour note.",/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2017,rwl-95430,8," I like it
",I get a kick out of the professionals that complain that the show is unrealistic. I do the same for law enforcement shows. This is TV. Tell me which show is factually correct in every respect. Take NCIS one of the most popular and successful series ever. I was in federal law enforcement for almost 30 years and the stuff they do is so ridiculous. But it is entertaining which is what these TV shows are intended to be.,/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2020,poohead45,5," Lots of spoilers. Not good (but I was semi entertained)
","I was bored and saw this show was on Netflix with 4 seasons and I was happy I had a new show to watch. It was ridiculous but entertaining. It had a lot of ""wtf"" moments.",/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2014,estatelawcanada,9," Character driven, exciting, and addictive
","I have to start off by saying that I am not usually a fan of medical drama shows. I was never interested in ER, Grey's Anatomy, Scrubs, or any of the other shows of this kind. This one, however, I like.",/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2018,clintstevens,1," Prime Time Soap Opera Drivel
","For those who miss the daytime soap operas, this should be your cup of tea. Everyone at this hospital bickers with each other, patients never die (well, they do die, but the staff performs miracles and brings them back to life) and doctors and nurses are constantly hopping into bed with each other. And if you tire of the hospital surroundings, you can enjoy the same ridiculous plots that take place in Syria. The stories are all embarrassing and beyond belief and the acting is worse. Case in point is Scott Wolf. I am not too familiar with him, but I know he's been around for decades. If all his work is similar to the character he portrays here, it is a mystery to me how he continues to get acting jobs. His grimaces, bug eyes, and gestures are laughable. He treats every line like he is reciting Shakespeare. When he's on camera I just cringe! The only mystery bigger than how he gets acting jobs is why so many people think this is a good show.",/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv

9 February 2018,aaronredis,1," The Night Shift: A series that started out a little rough, fixed itself up to be pretty good, but then fell right on its face in the final season.
","I'm not surprised by the news of ""The Night Shift"" being canceled. I have been a loyal fan of ""The Night Shift,"" but in the fourth season, the series really lost touch with its roots. The fourth season started out just okay, but by their fourth episode, it started going downhill. The show seemed it faced a bit of an identity crisis, as it couldn't decide whether or not it was military medicine or work back at home at Texas San Antonio night shift. I think the series peaked in its third season. Season three was near perfect, but the show's fourth season had too much going on (as I said, come the fourth episode and that point on).

28 May 2014,nannymom31-12-173713,9," Hopes for a new series
","I hope this runs longer than one season. I found it charming and uplifting that there could ever be a place where people meant more than the bottom line.The characters seemed to fit.The heart was in the place with each doctor nurse and staff. Maybe it is too much for some just coming back from duty,but I liked it. I will be tuning in each week to see what happens. I would class it in line with N.C.I.S and hope it stays around. I wish more shows were of the drama involved here.Inspired. Tragic brings hope without terror.Keep up the good work.The facts are that they don't take entertainment serious anymore. Casting works in this case the seem to fit just right.",/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2018,djpnut,10," So bad its great!!!
","This show is terrible, but on a level where its almost playing on all the cliches that make network tv so bad. Which is why i love this show. 
It feels intentional by the producers, eerily similar to 90210, Party of 5, and Dawson's Creek of 20 years ago. Random slow motion scenes, ridiculous explanations for what caused the patients trauma, way over dramatized ER power struggles out of no where, wierd sexual tension, the stereotypes are perfect and extremely unrealistic, problems are solved out of no where throught an episode, and relationship paralyzing issues over the most random things. The acting is so on point, just like one of Christopher Guest's infamous mockumentaries.",/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2014,stevefont,4," army doctor employed at the ER after the war.
","Being a surgeon myself i watched two episodes (first two). I cannot believe my eyes! I know for cinematic purposes medical procedures are a little different from real world. But when you do open chest surgery in the ER, with no masks!!! What are the directors trying to portray here? Drama and coolness abounds but glaring falsity in treating patients must not be twisted. wrong wrong wrong. At least HouseMD and Greys anatomy do not distort the medical procedures (sterility etc). They need a medical adviser to make this better. The first episode with the doctor doing auto transfusion without filtering is again a misnomer with what we really do. I will not go to this hospital ever.",/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2014,Shopaholic35,8," A dramatic action comedy about a bunch of doctors working the night shift.
","You just know this show is not going to be realistic in any form right from the first minutes of the pilot episode. (SMALL SPOILER) Who seriously gets released from jail, hops on their motorbike, performs a lifesaving operation along the way (successfully) and then gets into work and swaps their bloody shirt for a scrubs top. Seriously where was the shower!!! (SPOILER OVER)",/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2014,roblanz-31-957669,1," absolute drivel an insult to those of us working in ER's
",I watched a couple of episodes before I turned it off forever. It is the worst depiction of ER life I have ever seen. It is more like a video game than a show. It should be a soap opera not a evening TV show.,/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2014,isaac-vpacheco,9," The Night Shift Lives!
","I find it quite funny how the general public of today can't give credit where it's due. This show, any show at that is geared for entertainment purposes and that's that.",/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2014,robin_should,1," Seen a lot of bad TV
","I watched the first episode and thought this can only get better, give it another chance. Episode 2, how wrong can one be, it actually got worse and I finally turned it off after 20 minutes. A definite no go. The acting is only as bad as the script makes it. There are a couple of good actors in this show who should be doing better work. Wonder sometimes whether they really read the script or they get talked into things. I can really claim I have been watching TV for around 55 years and have seen good things be canceled and bad things stay for a long run. Maybe they will manage to make this better but they will have lost so many viewers by then it may be too late. I'm gone.",/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2014,jk-692-236394,1," Just so bad
","I honestly could not believe how bad this was. It looks cheaply made. The acting was like watching acting students who knew they were being filmed. Now I know some of these actors have been successful in other things. So I have to blame the writers and the show itself. It feels like a jumble of 100 other medical ""dramas"" with the all the parts that do not work. I watch stuff like this to fall asleep to but I found myself waking up with annoyance at how bad it was. This is the medical version of ""Friends with Better Lives"", which I felt the same way about after one episode. I said that is getting canceled STAT. And it was. This will never make it. They will burn it off for summer and it will be done. There is nothing worth watching on this show.",/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2021,madisondsinger,7," entertaining
","This show isn't the best show I've ever seen, but it's definitely a good one. The story isn't always consistent, and neither are the characters, but each episode brings a fun and new issue that the cast has to deal with. I watched this show with my little sister and we had a lot of good laughs and got completely hooked on the story. So although it's not revolutionary, super unique, or well written, it's entertaining and will do the job of stopping any boredom you might feel. Ragosa is my favorite :)",/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2017,lindajean4044,2," Dumb Script Writing! Get your act together!
","I so wanted to enjoy this series, mainly because I liked the characters of TJ, Drew and Jordan. Right now am watching Season 4 episode 2. It ends with TJ receiving a cell phone call from Jordan who is back in the states. TJ is covered in blood and grime, not even had a chance to clean up from his mis-adventure and now he is answering his cell phone? Why did he not just call for help when he was on the run and rescuing Syd! Good grief writers! ",/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2021,koudielolz,5," Show is cute and mindless.
","This show is very medically inaccurate on a level that's almost comedic. Doctor says ""don't worry it's a superficial wound"" then pulls a huge steak knife out of someone haha. The drama is fun, but the acting is usually bad except for a few scenes here and there. The scenes that hit well really hit well. But it's not the regular. I cannot believe this show is rated almost as high as Greys Anatomy. Greys isn't the most accurate either but at least the acting and character development is awesome. This show is like the dollar store version of greys. Not totally unwatchable but not fantastic. Just kinda eh.",/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2017,katieshepherd-29218,10," fantastic show
",i started watching the show after finding it on Netflix. After the first episode i wasn't too sure but i carried on watching and now i can say its fantastic and i can't wait to see what happens in the rest of the show.,/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2014,escherdonna,," Best new show of 2014
","I look forward to viewing the summer shows but Night Shift is the BEST new show I have seen in years. I hope the NBC has the good sense to bring it back for a full season!!! The characters are rich and well developed. The plot lines are excellent and the writing is superb. Having worked the night shift in a hospital years ago I can appreciate the various trials the staff has to endure such as shortage of staff, equipment, etc, but even to the layman this show has everything to offer with the story lines, suspense, a little romance, the hesitation of new doctors trying to care for their patient's with as much expertise as their limited experience allows and glimpses into the past of some of the doctors that contribute to the people they are currently.",/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2014,gradyharp,5," Yet another hospital drama trauma
","Now that General Hospital has faded from view and Grey's Anatomy seems to be finishing up and Nurse Jackie is more concerned with drug addiction than patient care in the ER, in flies NIGHT SHIFT - only one shift to deal with and of course that is when all manner of patients filter through from tree limbs penetrating chests, to near decapitation in a child, to addicts on the prowl for drugs, to emergency heart transplant (!) and on and on. The novelty? A group of Army doctors return to work on the night shift at a hospital in San Antonio. Mixed in with this crew is a young very nervous new doc (Robert Bailey, Jr) who cowers at his assignments of checking a group of senior citizens for STDs, the macho war vet Dr.TC (Eoin Macken) who has a history with the new lead physician Dr. Jordan Alexander (Jill Flint), a female shrink (Daniela Alonzo), an in-the-process-of-going-blind cost conscious CEO (Freddy Rodríguez), the requisite closeted gay army medic (Brendan Fehr), Asian medic (Ken Leung), and African American Medic (JR Lemon) and on it goes.",/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2018,katielbeckham,4," Im not surprised it was cancelled
","This show had all the pieces to be something great, but it is sadly more of a let down then anything else. You easily fall in love with some of the characters like Brendan Fehr and his portrayal of Dr. Alister, Ken Leung as Dr Topher, JR Lemon as Nurse Kenny and Freddy Rodriguez playing Michael Rogosa as the hard arse that you grow to love. However through out a show that is meant to capture humanity in some of it's most vulnerable times and deal with current issues across a wide spectrum, the writing is weak and unfulfilling. You have main cast member shave tumours in one episode and then they have survived what few do without any screen time of this. You have a character that is struggling to be openly gay and where this is an occurring theme, after his partner loses his leg and a small break up they run off to get married (which again we don't see) Another main characters is written off by an email being sent to the staff to say he died in a car accident, after being on the show for 3 season and guess what the next episode is a month later, where the whole team have healed from this tragic passing. The afore mentioned gay couple try to adopt a kid when the real dad turns up out of the blue with about 5 mins screen, of course wanting to stop them and by the end of one episode this is all resolved and they take there daughter home. It just feels like lazy writing and no interest in actually exploring things in depth, which is a shame because they had some good examples of storylines. Such a disappointment all and all, where there is short lived problems and miraculous diagnosis.",/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2017,cstephenson-1961,10," Outstanding Show!!
","This show is outstanding and easily addictive! Been watching it since it came on and it get's better and better! The Its great ensemble cast with superb chemistry. The stories are fresh and compelling. Showing both what the doctors/nurses and staff go through as well as the patients. You'll see laughter, tears and everything in between.",/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2014,JMich3752,1," don't waste your time
","I usually give new series a three episode window. I stopped recording after two. It's just bad. Forget the fact that they have doctors performing heart transplants without doing tissue matching tests, doing field surgery, and hitting each other. The stereotypes of veterans, blacks, Latinos, nurses, doctors are abundant and insulting. The characters are tropes as are the situations. The troubled veteran, fighting for justice while recovering from PTSD. Give me a break. It's insulting to doctors, veterans, and people with PTSD.",/review/rw3028807/?ref_=tt_urv
