2 May 2022,movieman_kev,9," best film of 2022
","Profoundly deep, genuinely moving, utterly hilarious, highly imaginative and a visual feast. Haven't laughed this hard, cried this much or thought so deeply about any film in 2022 Much less all in the same viewing. This was indeed everything, everywhere all at once.",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2022,evanston_dad,9," Felt Like I Was Seeing the Inside of My Own Mind on Screen
","I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2022,grantss,4," Disappointing: more style than substance
","Evelyn Wang and her husband Waymond run a laundry. Times are tough and they're in trouble with the Internal Revenue Service. There's also some niggle with their daughter and her father is a constant source of belittlement and scorn. Now Waymond wants a divorce. Could things have turned out differently for Evelyn, maybe in a parallel universe?",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2022,benjaminskylerhill,10," The most original film ever made. Period.
","Everything Everywhere All At Once is even crazier than the trailer would lead one to believe. It's bursting with so many original, weird concepts and ideas that no serious storyteller in their right mind would ever dare to put in their movie. But Daniels did. And it works with spectacularly effective results.",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2022,polsixe,5," Why the Acclaim?
","This one is a meh film, someone's alternate idea of multi-verse sci-fi and ""how do we script things to get Michelle Yeoh doing martial arts again"" ? A long, long way to push a theme about LGBT acceptance. The anal plugs and dildos were just odd and a strange inclusion. Some of the characters were outright annoying such as the daughter and the various minions. The hubby was OK as he smoothly switched personalities. Good old James Hong still with us, always recall him as ""hey that guy..."". Jamie Lee Curtis is fine as the IRS Auditor hamming it up. And Yeoh going through the paces, looks like a bit of a payday for her. All in all certainly not one of the better films of the year.",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,claudio_carvalho,1," Overhyped and Overrated Bad Trip
","I watch and re-watch a lot of movies per year as a hobby (no money involved), and today I have 9988 reviews in IMDb. Last month, I received an email from IMDb listing ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" as one of the Top-10 movies of 2022. In IMDb, it is informed that this flick is nominated for 10 BAFTA Awards, 240 wins and 351 nominations. I can only understand that this is a heard behavior to the promotion of studio, using ""professional critics"" and press to promote such a garbage. I cannot envision a normal being, without financial interest or being manipulated by critics, to enjoy this crap. It seems to be a bad trip of the writers turned into a movie by insane productors. In the end, this film is 2h 19 min of complete waste of time. My vote is one (awful).",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2022,somf,3," Don't remember the last time I disagreed so much with both critics and audiences
","I won't get a lot of likes here. Really stupid concept. Absolutely annoying frenetic style. Acting was way over the top. Did not work for me one iota. I cannot remember another movie that scored over an 8 on IMDB that I did not at least enjoy. Full disclosure, I only watched 70 minutes and decided I was way done with this film. I give it 3 stars for not being run of the mill .",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2022,Instant_Palmer,5," A Pointless Bucket of Tedious Sophomoric Visual Metaphors
","Visual Orgy of Visual Metaphors That Get Old Well Before Film Ends. So disappointing, and the film doesn't live up to the hype. First half has some engaging moments, where it could have wrapped up without ""explaining"" what we already knew. I don't need a primer to explain the content and themes of a film thank you very much.",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2022,Blumanowar,6," Absurdly overrated
",I get the movie but why is it every time a strange movie gets high ratings.. I think it's because most people don't understand it yet they don't want to look stupid by saying they don't. Watch the movie when it's free but don't waste $20 to see it or you'll be deeply disappointed.,/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,classicsoncall,4," ""I got bored one day and put everything on a bagel.""
","Well, where to start? I'm going to try to be fair with my review but quite honestly, it's going to be difficult not to be flippant. The film is currently a Top 250 IMDb picture with an 8.2 rating, and rarely do I stray too far from the generally considered opinion, but this was just a chore to sit through. Not only that, but if you fell asleep for any length of time before it was over it wouldn't have made any difference at all, you wouldn't have missed a beat. In fact, the first time I saw 'The End' pop up on screen, it would have been okay with me.",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2022,Lejink,3," To Bagel Or Not To Bagel...
","It was my brother who recommended I watch this movie. He said it's crazy, but every time he thought to stop watching it, something else would happen to hold his attention. That wasn't quite my experience although I did stick with it to the end. I was also reminded of an almost identical experience some 20 years or so ago when a friend took me along with him to see a film he was raving about, ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and that missed me by miles too when all that levitational martial-arts stuff started.",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2022,AfricanBro,9," Don't do drugs, watch this instead.
","If you take drugs for the first time and imagined Jackie Chan was a female Dr. Strange in another universe this would be it. And the synopsis is basically an Asian woman trying to do her taxes. I thought the third act of the movie felt a little stretched out but otherwise I think it's the best movie I've seen all year because I haven't laughed this much in any recent one. From the short time I spent in China, it's also an accurate and hilarious view of Chinese parents 'cause they really do be like that. I can't recommend it enough, it's so chaotic and in the middle of all that managed to be heartfelt too. I thought it was gonna be a Dr Strange wannabe but it's unique on it's own and I'm glad it was released earlier so that people don't compare them. It was just four people (strangers) in the cinema, we were laughing our asses off and it made me sad because everyone deserves to see this. At a time when remakes and reboots are common place it's nice to have something like this, a breath of fresh air.",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2022,cgvsluis,1," It would have been kinder if the reviews had been more honest about the content of this film...I may have skipped it.
","This was a long and unnecessarily complex film to get you the message that life and people are messy and you should accept them for who they are. I would have preferred a more straightforward story telling and I could have done without all of the body humor...putting things forcibly in one's anus, ball gag humor, hot dog fingers, eating buggers, etc. I didn't even find that type of humor amusing as a child.",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,shanc_sk,5," Highly Overrated
","Not the popular opinion, but this one is another disappointing multiverse outing.",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2022,Roman-pc,1," RUN if you can help it
","This maybe the worst movie experience I've had in a theatre in long long time. I really can't remember the last time I watched a movie until the end and feeling utterly dejected without walking out--the closest is one of the more recent superhero movies (Avengers). Both titles have received high praise both from critics as well as audiences--but I did not connect with either of them. Clearly I am not the target-audience--I have little patience for films that claim to be ""smart"" by the sheer amount of confusion they cause--but a movie hailed by many as ""nearly perfect"" is hardly watchable.",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,pattie7459,3," Absolutely bonkers , and not for me
","Beautifully filmed and everyone hamming it up . Started up promising but then I completely lost the plot....
I was prepared to give it a chance and watched it till the end ....urghh unbearable in parts ...couldn't wait till it finished .",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,iamianiman,9," The best acid trip experience that can only be felt once in a lifetime!
","Most of us who are mindful of the film can agree on one thing, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like you're walking on an acid trip experience. It's an imaginary film that makes you feel like you had just swallowed a bottle of limitless pills, dopes, drugs or other substances that may similarly affect your consciousness and memories.",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2022,subxerogravity,9," What a perfect title for this movie.

23 May 2022,Abdulxoxo,6," Way overhyped
","This film almost unanimously received praise from both critics and audience alike. People even exaggeratedly rank it as one of the greatest films ever or the best they've ever seen. Going into this movie, my expectations were really high And I really wanted to be part of the majority who loves this movie. But unfortunately the opposite happened and I didnt like it. While I appreciate that this movie was made on a relatively small budget and managed to get some things right as it had so much potential with its strong female lead, philosophical component and some good action to move it along. But it fell really short. It is long and meandering. Visually confusing, thematically unoriginal. The first half was repetitive, boring and also quite silly. Half of the time I don't know what are they fighting for or what the heck is going on. And what was supposed to be the multiverse just felt like the characters were wearing silly different costumes. It is not until the last act that things of relevance happened. The performance from the cast was great though.",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2022,statuskuo,9," Near Flawless Film
","Rarely does a movie hit me hard and I go along for the ride. Every moment has a spectacle to it. Even the simplicity of having your taxes done. Often silly, mostly confusing but entirely entertaining. It was great to see Short Round back on the big screen with a very glamoured down Michelle Yeoh as a married couple on the brink of fracturing a family unit.",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2022,Marwan-Bob,4," What a Mess
","It's been a long time since i felt this way watching a film and wanting it just to end, This is a perfect example of how a good idea can turn into a waste. I really wanted to like this film but unfortunately i felt frustrated, irritated, disgusted and bored all at once.",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2022,inyourimage,4," My head!!!!
","I think they were trying to be deep and profound, but what resulted was two hours of head-splitting chaos and confusion. It is a shame, because I had high hopes for this movie. I just don't understand the hype. They tried too hard to be weird. I think at the end they were trying to pull the heartstrings, but I was too confused to know for sure. I'm not even sure what the movie was about. I think it had something to do with familial relations, or perhaps current tax laws? Whatever it was, they should have had an epileptic seizure warning.",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2022,tabuno,9," With its strong storyline and amazing parallel universes, this sci fi movie sets a new bar for sci fi
","Michelle Yeoh headlines this head trip into the multi-verse. The first part is slow going as this reality is not suggested in the previews and thus somewhat lulls the audience into expecting something different. But what makes this movie really work is its underlying storyline even as reading subtitles and trying to understand what is going on during the first half of the movie takes a bit of mental endurance. Allowing for that though, this movie bursts at the seams in being everything all at once, sequentially that is, in two-dimensions trying to project a four-dimensional reality and a multitude of parallel universes that all include Michelle Yeoh in some form or fashion. This movie definitely breaks through to a new level of sci fi visual delight and sophistication along with a strong storyline. Like Inception (2010), this is a breakthrough movie setting a higher bar of sci fi movies in the future.",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2022,MogwaiMovieReviews,3," Sound and Fury, Signifying Everything Everywhere All at Once
","I'd heard good things about this, but the fact of the matter is it's basically just any of the Matrix films jumbled up with some overused Spider-verse/ Dr Strange / Rick & Morty, etc. ""multiverse"" plot ideas that I've seen far too many times now to find innovative or get excited over.",/review/rw8157696/?ref_=tt_urv
