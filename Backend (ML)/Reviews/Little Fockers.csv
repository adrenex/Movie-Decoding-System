17 October 2005,Smells_Like_Cheese,8," $1,000,000? For a night with Robert Redford? For real? Where do I sign up?!
","Wow, I am a little surprised by the rating. Only 5.3? Come on, this was a good movie! Was it the best? No, but it's better than most I have seen. If you were offered a million dollars, could the strength of your relationship survive it? I really got into this movie, because I knew how it would damage the couple's life. I think that they did deeply love each other, but they mention how they were childhood sweethearts, and kind of rushed into marriage. So, the point is, they've probably never been able to question if they had feelings for anyone else.",/review/rw2680496/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2005,bob the moo,," An interesting idea is condensed into a superficial and glossy affair that does nothing of value
","David and Diana had been in love since college and married into a dream life where both are happy and able to pursue their dreams together. However they hit upon hard times when Diana's real estate work dries up and soon the pair decide that the only option available to them is a literal last throw of the dice with their last few thousand in Vegas. Despite an early winning streak they end up worse than they started. About to head off, Diana catches the eye of gambling billionaire John Gage who uses her as a lucky charm to win another million or so. Afterwards they get together to play some pool and Gage turns the conversation to the idea of what money can and can't buy - specifically offering the Murphy's a cool $1,000,000 for one night spent with Diana.",/review/rw2680496/?ref_=tt_urv

This is the titular ""Indecent Proposal"", on which millions of viewers, men and women, have been debating for years, placing themselves in the same tricky situation than David (Woody Harrelson) and Diana (Demi Moore), the ill-fated couple who met the devilishly sexy John Gage (Robert Redford) in Las Vegas.

5 March 2018,gridoon2023,7," Glossy movie with Demi Moore at the apex of her beauty
","Provocative premise receives stylish treatment from director Adrian Lyne; this film has a luxurious, almost sensuous texture, part of which comes from the ultra-glossy cinematography, and part from Demi Moore, who was at the time at the peak of her beauty and at the top of the world in her career (her hairstyle is amazing in this film). Oliver Platt, as the comic relief, gets in some funny lines. But the movie is not all surface - there is plenty of food for discussion in its themes, if one is so inclined. *** out of 4.",/review/rw2680496/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2005,arichmondfwc,6," Where is James Mason when we need him
","Adrian Lyne does what he does beautifully, whatever that is. The gorgeous look of his films hide a serious lack of depth and a rather Machiavellian knack for attracting us, the natives, with shiny pretty things. We fall for it every time, or almost, we couldn't swallow Lolita, oh no, he should have left Lolita alone and shouldn't have made that outrageous statement, remember? ""James Mason was all wrong in Kubrick's version of the Nabokov novel"" Do me a favor Mr. Lyne, stick to ""Flashdance"" and suffer all the way to the bank. Sorry, I lost myself for a moment. Where was I? Oh yes ""Inidecent Proposal"" Imagine that premise in the hands of someone with serious intentions. A young happy couple and the devil. The stranger who, incapable of bearing goodness and happiness, decides to destroy it. Aware of their needs, he presents a solution to their problems. He doesn't care for her, he cares about their destruction. Juicy stuff. But, although Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson are great as the perfect foil for the devil's designs, the devil is Robert Redford. Mr. Redford is a personal hero of mine, instead of resting in his laurels, Sundance, the environment, Ordinary People, Quiz Show and so on and so on. But, I heard him say in a Charlie Rose interview that he would like to play different characters, dangerous, dark but nobody offered him that kind of part. What about this one Bob? This was a part that could transform this pretty candy floss into a classic. It needed guts. Where was the darkness? I looked into Redford eyes and I saw Redford. I would have gone with him for much less than a million bucks because in spite of the fact that involved accepting an indecent proposal there was no danger, really. He allows himself to be Redford all the way. The indecency is in the title in the gimmick but not in the spirit. As a result none of the promises are fulfilled and we're left with a pretty inconsequential movie. Oh well, I hope Mr Lyne learned his lesson. One never bad mouths James Mason, okay?",/review/rw2680496/?ref_=tt_urv

","Mind-numbingly boring, utterly predictable and in the end simply laughable. That pretty much sums up the disaster that is Indecent Proposal. Starting with a decent premise the whole thing just unravels and becomes a complete mess. Basically the story boils down to the question, ""would you let your wife sleep with another man for one million dollars?""

He's the man who makes the Indecent Proposal to Demi Moore to spend a night of nights.

","Cotton candy involving a loving couple (bordering on good buddies) who lose their shirts in Las Vegas but get a chance to recoup when a world-famous billionaire makes a play for the wife--with booty attached! Great set-up for a story that takes a slow spiral downward once the couple returns home (to a rather lovely cottage in Southern California). Some sparks from principals Robert Redford and Demi Moore, but Woody Harrelson is out of his league and Adrian Lyne's direction is all visual and nothing much upstairs (and I could've done without the horse-racing video suddenly morphing into a shot of Demi in ""the act""). The film is shamefully enjoyable, and capped with teen-romance fever, but aren't these characters a little old for moony-eyed puppy love? ** from ****",/review/rw2680496/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2012,JohnHowardReid,4," Glossy But Empty
","A glossy soap opera, complete with an unconvincing storyline, slick direction and actors who -- with one exception -- are obviously mimicking whatever incompetent instructions the director is throwing at them. By far the worst is Woody Harrelson. Admittedly, what his character is forced to do and say is stupid, illogical and downright ridiculous. But a really good actor, finding himself cast in this unbelievable shell of a role, would do something. Barrymore, for example, would really send it up; Mason would play it really tongue-in-cheek; Cooper would act against the role and deliver his lines frozen-faced. But Harrrelson does zilch. He acts it out as if the author was William Shakespeare, totally ignoring the fact that his character is always inconsistent, often motiveless, and sometimes absolutely ridiculous. Demi Moore does a little bit better, particularly when she gets away from the incompetent Harrelson, and is partnered by a real actor in Robert Redford. In fact, Redford is the only reason anyone would bother to see this movie. He brightens every scene in which he appears. And when he's forced to say something stupid, he smacks it across with a twinkle in his eye. That's what acting is all about -- not emoting like mad and running off at the mouth!",/review/rw2680496/?ref_=tt_urv

29 August 2019,cashbacher,10," The power of money over the desperate
","When this movie came out, there were many people that derided the plot device of a man offering a married couple a million dollars for a night with the wife. Their claim was that it was immoral and truly indecent. That is too bad, for it misses the real messages of the movie.
First and foremost, this movie is about the power that money gives the rich over those that are down on their luck and are desperate. They are willing to grasp at any chance they have to right their errant financial ship. Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson play Diana and David Murphy, a married couple that go to Las Vegas with their last stake in the hope that they will win big enough to pay themselves out of their financial hole. When this doesn't work, John Gage (Robert Redford) offers them a million dollars for a night of passion with Diana. After a reality gut-check, the couple agrees to the proposal.
Tensions mount between the couple afterwards and the course of their relationship sours. It becomes a test of what they believe about each other and how they will weather the emotional consequences of selling out. In the end, the movie becomes a complicated love story.
Mao Zedong famously said, ""Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."" What this movie illustrates is that all power grows out of the pile of cash available. When people are down and desperate, the person that can offer massive amounts of money has the power. After all, there must be a way for those seeking power to pay for the guns and ammunition.",/review/rw2680496/?ref_=tt_urv
