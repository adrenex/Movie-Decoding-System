11 March 2014,Wuchakk,10," ""Where does it end?"" -- ""It never ends.""
","If Homer's mythical epic ""The Iliad"" is based on a factual story, that story is magnificently depicted in Wolfgang Petersen's 2004 epic ""Troy."" In other words, don't expect any goofy 'gods' or 'goddesses' like Athena popping out of thin air because ""Troy"" is a realistic portrayal of the Trojan war.",/review/rw0894890/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," One of my favorite movies
","I love this movie, by far my favorite R rated movie and in the running for one of the greatest and most epic in my opinion. The acting, the world-building, the character depth, and the thrill of such an incredible depiction of the time period. I didn't think it was possible to make an accounting of the Trojan war void of the supernatural presence of the Greek Gods that rivals the old story in excellence, but this movie does.",/review/rw0894890/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2020,MickeyTheConstant,10," Still love this movie
","Watched this movie last night. Had not seen it for years. Loved it then and loved it now. Yes, the acting is a bit naff but seriously what a movie. It really is a historical war movie rather tran an action flick. The battle and fights scenes are superb, some of the best you will see. The costumes, set design and CGI are excellent. Everything is bathed in glorious sunshine, I don't know how anyone can really knock it. It also does challenge you on who to support. The Greeks kind of go looking for war but at the same time it was the wimp Paris who ran off with Helen. The Trojan's don't want to fight but at the same time Paris did instigate it. Hector is the most noble but then stupidly steps into his brothers duel to save him, ending the one chance of peace Troy has. As for Achilles, well he is super cool and moody. Don't bother taking sides, just enjoy the sun.",/review/rw0894890/?ref_=tt_urv

26 April 2012,nickmesafilms,8," Troy (2004) - Long Live, Achilles!
","Loosely based on Homer's 'Iliad', Wolfgang Petersen directs this epic war film, with an ensemble cast including Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Diane Kruger, Sean Bean, Brian Cox, Rose Byrne, Garrett Hedlund, Peter O' Toole, Brendan Gleeson, & Tyler Mane. Set in 1193 B.C., this movie tells the story of a war between the two cities of Troy and Sparta, and the story of one of the bravest warriors to roam ancient Greece named Achilles. Brad Pitt delivers one of the best performances of his career as Achilles, giving the right amount of power and strength. Eric Bana is also terrific as Prince Hector, trying to negotiate peace between Troy and Sparta. Besides the supporting cast, Peter O' Toole is just perfect playing the king of Troy. The only disappointing character in this movie is Orlando Bloom as Hector's prince brother, who seems to overreact in every scene he is in, as if trying to end the project early, and walk away with his paycheck. Although the movie contains a running time of 162 minutes, director Wolfgang Petersen perfectly makes the audience forget about those 162 minutes, because they'll be distracted by all the incredible action. This movie contains some of the most elaborate action sequences that I've ever seen on film. The costumes and the art direction all stay true to the ancient Greece setting, and they all create a realistic feel to the movie. This movie is perfectly well-made, from the distinguished art, to the intense battle sequences. Yes, the movie is somewhat inaccurate to Homer's Iliad, but at least this movie is flat out entertaining. I haven't seen that much gladiator movies in my time, but I can safely say that ""Troy"" is one of the most remarkable and action-packed motion pictures that audiences will never forget. ""Troy"", in my review, ""action-packed, beautifully well-made"".",/review/rw0894890/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2012,ja0576,9," It's just a movie
","I'm sick of all the bad reviews for this movie. I really don't give a damn if it's true to the Iliad or not. The movie is extremely entertaining. I really like the fact that the gods are downplayed in this movie. It makes the story a lot more realistic. The acting was good. The story was good. The dialogue was good. The action scenes were good. I really can't see what's not to like in this movie. I guess I could pick it apart and find flaws, but I could do that with every movie ever made. For those upset by the fact that there was no definite good side or bad side, I have some shattering news. In war, there is never a good side or bad side. War is all subjective depending on whose side you are on. Every side thinks they are the good guys. A lot of people were upset about Paris, who is cast as a coward, becoming heroic in the end. Like it or not, we all have cowardliness and heroism within us. We just don't like to admit it. So, ignore the critics and watch this movie. Remember, critics have an opinion just like everyone else and as the old saying goes, opinions are like a**holes. Everyone has one and a lot of them stink. You don't have to agree with me, but don't let someone else make up your mind for you either.",/review/rw0894890/?ref_=tt_urv

","People give this movie too much hate for being ""not entirely accurate to the Iliad"" or whatever. But In reality, I don't think there's ever a time I haven't been impressed when watching scenes from this movie. Some are emotional, most action packed, and most importantly makes Achilles look badass (as it should). But all in all movie quality or not, this film is entertaining.",/review/rw0894890/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2021,ryan_acc,10," You should rewatch this. It ages well.
",I loved this movie on the first (and second and third etc) time watching. I was truly baffled at my friends and peers who ridiculed the movie and said it was just Hollywood cashing in on big stars and the trend of epic movies being released. Maybe that's true but it shouldn't detract from this being honestly one of the best 'epic movies' of its time.,/review/rw0894890/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2020,chaswe-28402,10," Gods envy men's mortality: myth is mutable
","Far better than I expected from its reputation and the critics. This is as lavish and enjoyable an old-fashioned film epic as I have seen, and much better than most. Epic is not an easy genre in which to satisfy the nit-pickers: it paints a story with broad strokes, and it's not difficult to find fault with smaller details. Things worth noting: the contrasting balance between the two sides seemed particularly well done. The Trojans were vaguely Asian or near-Eastern, and the Greeks were vaguely Germanic or Western. At the same time the armour and equipment of both were equally impressive, and more or less of an age. The Trojans were softer, more civilized and tender; the Greeks were rougher and tougher and more barbaric, but more effective --- and cunning. A civilized man is a city-dweller. The Trojans were citizens, the Greeks were rustics. In the end the cunning peasants won.",/review/rw0894890/?ref_=tt_urv

16 May 2004,BBBrown,9," So it's not(!) the Iliad...
","But it's an inspiring tale of men(!) at war in ancient times.  The movie, albeit long, moves along a good pace, with mercifully brief romantic and philosophical breaks between the combat scenes.  This movie is action, with more than a little thought put into accurately presenting the realities of the tactics used in Greek warfare.  Troy is also to be congratulated for not over-armoring the cast like previous Hollywood productions and staying true to the lightness of armor prevalent during the historical period.",/review/rw0894890/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2004,ma-cortes,7," Overwhelming and breathtaking epic film with all-star-cast
","It's a great adventure movie that offers a wide range of expectations of the epic genre . This historical movie deals with Troya war as a mamouth adaptation from classic poem written by Homer . Helena (Diane Kruger) , wife of Menelao of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) , escapes with Paris (Orlando Bloom underwent archery training for his role as Legolas in Lord of the rings , 2001) and its two sequels). The Greek Army and ships go to Troya with Aquiles (Brad Pitt who trained for six months to get a body that looked like that of Greek statues) , the king of Micenas , Agamenón (Brian Cox) , and the Spartans . They fight against king of Troya (Peter O'Toole) and his sons : Héctor (Eric Bana) and Paris.",/review/rw0894890/?ref_=tt_urv

","Loosely based on Homer's 'Iliad', Wolfgang Petersen directs this epic war film, with an ensemble cast including Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Diane Kruger, Sean Bean, Brian Cox, Rose Byrne, Garrett Hedlund, Peter O' Toole, Brendan Gleeson, & Tyler Mane. Set in 1193 B.C., this movie tells the story of a war between the two cities of Troy and Sparta, and the story of one of the bravest warriors to roam ancient Greece named Achilles. King Agamemnon (Brian Cox) is ruler of Mycenea, but wishes to rule an empire, so his army slowly conquers the rest of what is now Greece. The only threat to his empire is a neighbouring country called Troy. Agamemnon's brother Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) is tired of war, so he negotiate's peace with the Trojan princes Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom). Upon leaving, Paris reveals to Hector that he has taken Menelaus's wife, Helen (Diane Kruger) with him, as he loves her. Menelaus goes to Agamemnom to start a war, and Agamemnom manages to convince legendary warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt) to fight among the Greek army. Hector and Paris arrive in Troy, and tell their father Priam (Peter O'Toole) of the upcoming war. Agamemnom arrives on the beaches of Troy with 1,000 ships, but after day 1, Achilles refuses to fight, and instead cares to Trojan prisoner Briseis (Rose Byrne). Over the next two battles Hector kills Menelaus, Ajax (who is the Greek's best warrior after Achilles), and Achilles's cousin, Patroclus, and finally Achilles decides to don his armour and face Hector in a duel to the death.",/review/rw0894890/?ref_=tt_urv

","Have always been fascinated by Greek mythology and the Trojan War, and Homer's 'Iliad' is a major example as to why. Also love and appreciate many film epics, of which there are numerous classics, and they were the main reasons in my interest in seeing 'Troy' (another being that it was the film of choice at the friend/family weekly film night).

5 December 2013,Richie-67-485852,9," Troy...Oh Boy!
","There is greatness afoot in this movie. It comes from the Director, the actors and of course the story of the Iliad itself. Beautifully filmed and easy to follow my only complaint was that it didn't last longer when I saw it in the theater. I saw it again on cable and even bought the DVD. But then, I discovered the Blue-ray which added 30 extra minutes giving me closure on the issue once and for all. If someone said to you, choose a side: The Greeks or the Trojans? Then it becomes a personal war because you study closely what your choice is doing and why. Lots of lessons here for runaway egos, pride and smugness and in the end we all get what we deserve. The battle scenes here come across as very realistic and make no mistake. You fight until you cannot fight anymore. There is no yelling for a medic at the top of your lungs. Also note that the swinging of a sword tires one out more than you would think making even the most brutal warriors vulnerable after a short time. Highly recommend a good snack or two, a tasty drink and no interruptions. Be absorbed by this movie and help your side win even if it is only in your armchair or couch...",/review/rw0894890/?ref_=tt_urv

",I'm not much of an ancient war movie type of girl. But this really caught my attention. Other than the fact that I saw loads of people die horrendously and having to cover my eyes for a quarter of the film. It truly was really good. The acting was marvellous and the music was amazing. I especially love when the music builds up up to an intense scene. The scenery really captured that essence of history. I would definitely recommend this to any war movie lover.
