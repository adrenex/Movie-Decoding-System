25 July 2021,darkreignn,3," Horribly filmed action ruined this movie
","I'm a big fan of Yakuza films, so when I saw the trailer for ""Snake Eyes,"" I was ecstatic - a gritty, grounded origin of one of G. I. Joe's most beloved characters, in the form of a Japanese mobster movie, seemed too good to be true. And lo and behold, it was! ""Snake Eyes"" seems to suffer from an identity crisis; there is not enough gangster politics to be a successful gangster movie - there is not enough character development to be a satisfying drama - and perhaps the worst offense: there is not enough well-filmed action for this to be a great action film.",/review/rw7165002/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2021,siderite,3," A fantastic cast completely wasted on a stupid story
","First of all, this has *nothing* to do with G. I. Joe, as it is a medieval story about two Japanese clans and the protagonist is caught somewhat in between. Yes, it happens today, but 90% of all fights are using swords and the prize of the war is a magical stone. It's like someone took an existing Japanese samurai and ninjas script, added an extraneous character and made him the protagonist, then plastered on a Joe/Cobra connection and brought it into the present. And the way they added this stuff is like fixing a broken mirror with industrial sticky tape on the visible side.",/review/rw7165002/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2021,pablo_velasan,4," Am I supposed to root for Snake Eyes?
","The film is a very forgettable one, first of all the cinematography is terrible, the decision of using a shaky cam in the fight scenes is beyond me, as well as putting the camera so close to the fight which doesn't allow to appreciate the fighting sequences.",/review/rw7165002/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2021,Sleepin_Dragon,3," Lost the plot.
","I was genuinely so excited to see this, the trailers looked amazing. High octane for sure, but the total absence of a plot made this really tough to engage with.",/review/rw7165002/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2021,Fella_shibby,4," Atrocious editing ruined the action sequences. The locations are top notch though.
",I saw this mainly cos of Iko Uwais n got terribly disappointed cos his footage is less n he doesnt get to kick ass.,/review/rw7165002/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2021,jvg37,3," Shoddy Film - Bad Casting - Disrespects Source Material
","Saw the movie last night and was not impressed with anything I saw. The makers of this film have either no idea of the origins of Snake-Eyes or they intentionally destroyed the character. Aside from the fact that Snake-Eyes was always a Gaijin (white guy) he was also honorable in all that he did. This version has him as a two-faced, lying, thief. The feeble redemption arc in the final act was too little - too late, and unbelievable. The casting choices also left me a bit confused. Golding was never a good choice for Snake-Eyes and as much as I love Samara Weaving, she was a horrible Scarlet. The actress who ineptly portrayed the Baroness was too young for the character and was not even close to being believable. Iko Uwais was great as usual but would have been a much better Storm Shadow or even Snake-Eyes! Andrew Koji did do a good job as Storm Shadow and his was the best performance in the whole film by far.",/review/rw7165002/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2021,kangarooconnor,1," Throwing things at a wall bad
","Snake eyes was a movie I was extremely excited to see, movies have been lacking lately and after watching the bloated and awful ""Black Widow"" I wanted a gritty and enjoyable action movie. I went in fully expecting it to be bad, I hoped it would be better than the previous Joe movies but was only really there to watch action people do action things. But my disappointment was immeasurable and as I walked out of the theater with my friends all I could think was ""that was garbage.""",/review/rw7165002/?ref_=tt_urv

2 August 2021,statuskuo,2," None Of This Makes Sense
","First he's bad...then he's good, then no one knows if he's bad or good. But then he's...what a mess. Nothing about this movie makes sense..and you wonder why Snake Eyes doesn't talk. Or not suppose to.",/review/rw7165002/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2021,FeastMode,4," the plague of shaky cam
","You had one job. Good action, good fight scenes. You failed. As with many action movies, i could tell from the first fight it was going to be bad. And it was, throughout. You can't see anything. Constant close-ups and shaky cam. How is this still a thing? The action and fight scenes in G. I. Joe: Retaliation in 2013 were significantly better. I know this because i rewatched it the day before. Sm damn h.",/review/rw7165002/?ref_=tt_urv

","How is it possible to take such an amazing character like Snake Eyes and make t terrible? Well, the short answer is this movie.",/review/rw7165002/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2021,ThomDerd,3," If that's an origins film, then the origin is missing.
","Bad writing, which killed the character development and eventually the character itself.",/review/rw7165002/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2021,paul_haakonsen,5," This was not one for the records...
","Having grown up with the ""G. I. Joe"" cartoons on TV and always liked them, I must say that my expectations for this 2021 movie ""Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins"" weren't exactly sky high, given the previous live action movies based on the cartoons.",/review/rw7165002/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2021,Top_Dawg_Critic,6," Except for a pair of dice and a random ""G.I. Joe"" label, this is an assembly of every cliche, sloppily presented.
","Three seasoned screenwriters came up with this sloppy and convoluted mess of a story? The two hours felt dragged out with the most cliched action/martial-arts forgettable story, that was riddled with plot and technical issues. I can't remember the last time I saw such a predictable film.",/review/rw7165002/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2021,rendulic-nenad,4," Obnoxiously bad and shallow
",Characters try hard to be cool but end up being boring and weak.,/review/rw7165002/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2021,SnoopyStyle,5," almost o.k.
",It's the origins of G. I. Joe team member Snake Eyes (Henry Golding). Nobody asked for this. Nobody is really looking for this. The story is fine. It's a functional origins story if somewhat uninspired. Golding is fine. The actors are all fine. The action is fine but the constant CG work does make it repetitive. The last act drags as the repetitive action goes on and on. This is trying to set up for more G. I. Joe movies but that is unlikely to be successful.,/review/rw7165002/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2021,icegenz,1," The film is not about anything.

24 April 2022,Leofwine_draca,2," Didn't enjoy a single second
","Some kind of prequel to the G. I. Joe films and one of the very worst I've seen in a long time. An awful, senseless, badly written and terribly directed action film with barely any kind of coherent action. Henry Golding is miscast and out of place as the hero and the likes of Iko Uwais and Peter Mensah, both long favourites of mine, totally wasted. I can truly say I didn't enjoy a single second of this one.",/review/rw7165002/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2021,ilinmichalis,1," Biggest flop of 2021

7 September 2021,magnum-ajt,2," Why??
","Why is it so hard for them to make a good GI Joe movie? Just stick with the source material for starters. Not only did they want to tell some other story, the movie came across like a low budget film. Acting was atrocious on top of it. I'll give 1 bonus point for Peter Mensah as the only quality actor.",/review/rw7165002/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2022,matt_hew,1," G.I. NO NO NO!

26 July 2021,homodeuslee,6," Mediocre and badly written - one great film saving performance....
","So this is now essentially the third attempt to bring GI Joe to the big screen. Lorenzo Di Bonaventura returns at the helm and proves once again - he does not really care...
Honestly - how this film actually came to be is beyond me - a group of professional people working in the industry collectively decided that firstly : this film should be made - then that Evan Spiliotopoulos (who has hardly written a single great film to date) should write the damn thing - then add a director, Schwentke (who has a track record of terrible blockbuster films) - and let's top it off with TV travel host/Rom-com break out - Henry Golding to play Snake eyes himself. Shocking....",/review/rw7165002/?ref_=tt_urv
