31 March 2012,cosmo_tiger,9," A wonderful family movie that is full of heart and appeals to all ages. A must see family movie. I easily say its an A.
","""You know, sometimes all you need is twenty seconds of insane courage. Just literally twenty seconds of just embarrassing bravery. And I promise you, something great will come of it."" Benjamin Mee's (Damon) life is starting to crumble. His wife has died, his son is expelled from school and he quit his job. In hopes to start a new life they decide to move and find the perfect house. Then they realize that it's a zoo. I have to admit that I was a little skeptical going in because I thought that it would be a good movie but really cheesy. I really like Cameron Crowe though so I expected it to be good from that. I have to admit that this was one of the best family movies that I have seen in a long time. The movie had enormous heart, depth and tackled real world issues while still appealing to all ages. The writing and the acting were great and the movie absolutely won me over a half hour in. I highly recommend this one. Overall, this is a must see for families and is one to buy so you can watch over and over. I give it an A.",/review/rw2607914/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2011,ferguson-6,7," Like the Animals, Love the People
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Cameron Crowe has finally emerged from his cocoon - 7 years after the abysmal Elizabethtown. Yes, he has had a couple of projects in that time, notably the Pearl Jam documentary, but he has avoided anything related to his dramatic film roots of which produced ""Say Anything"", ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Almost Famous"". This time he delivers a feel good, family appropriate, sentimental crowd-pleaser that should play very well to the holiday crowd.",/review/rw2607914/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2011,moviexclusive,8," A lot of heart and humanity makes this a delightful, inspiring and poignant autobiographical tale notable too for a peerless lead act by Matt Damon
","You can't get more obvious what your film is about with a title like 'We Bought a Zoo', but fortunately director Cameron Crowe's adaptation of British journalist Benjamin Mee's autobiography possesses much more subtlety and nuance than what its title would suggest. The story of a grieving widower who makes the unusual decision to buy a rural property whose 18 acres includes the Rosemoor Animal Park, it is also Crowe's first feature since his 2005 flop 'Elizabethtown' and the feel-good family movie represents a welcome return to form for the talented filmmaker behind such classics like 'Say Anything' and 'Jerry Maguire'.",/review/rw2607914/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2012,patsworld,8," Film Clips Don't Do This Movie Justice
","We Bought A Zoo is a heart-warming, fun movie. The casting is a good as you could wish for and if I had to choose, I'd pick this as my favorite Matt Damon film. For anyone who loves animals, and I have to confess I'm about head of the line as one of them, this is a marvelous picture with not only the people personalities shining forth, but so too the animals. In most cases, we all know that the brief film clips shown prior to the movie are supposed to be showing the best of the picture. In this case, that is far from the truth. I almost passed this delightful movie up because all I could think of was, if this is the best there is...I don't think so. I'm so glad I opted to see it in spite of my reservations. Who ever picked the preview clips should be fired...or retrained, perhaps, because what they went with most certainly didn't do this movie justice. Not even close. It's a really enjoyable movie and I'd recommend it to everyone.",/review/rw2607914/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2011,holdenkara,10," In praise of earnestness
","I am grateful that in this cynical world, there are still artists who are courageous enough not to run from earnestness, but to embrace it. Cameron Crowe has done just that with WE BOUGHT A ZOO. This is a beautiful movie, full of life - truthfully acted, beautifully shot and lovingly directed. I expected to cry (which I did, many times) but I didn't know that it would also be so funny with levity coming just when you need it. Matt Damon was brilliant as the heartbroken but hopeful father. And my only gripe about Thomas Haden Church is that there wasn't more of him! The kids were all brilliant -- not an ounce of self-consciousness to their acting, which is rare when it comes to child actors. And the final scene alone is worth the price of admission. Anyone willing to open his or her heart will fall in love with this movie like I did. Kudos to all involved.",/review/rw2607914/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2012,bkoganbing,8," A Zoo for Mee and you.
",Matt Damon stars in a wonderful family film where he plays a widower dad who buys a zoo on life support. Rather We Bought A Zoo since it becomes a project for the whole Mee family that includes his son and daughter. It turns out to be a learning and healing experience all around.,/review/rw2607914/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2011,wbhendrix-1,9," Beautiful & Touching, Crowe does it again.
","Cameron Crowe never fails to deliver hart warming drama-comedies that make you laugh, cry and keep you on the edge of your seat for duration of his films. For me personally, I never seem to agree with Crowe's casting taste (Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson never do much for me) but Cameron has a way with actors and a true vision for his story. He always seems to know exactly who can capture his characters and ultimately draw out your emotions that he's tugging at. ",/review/rw2607914/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2011,jmeshearer,8," Simple and Hopeful.
","This film, starring Matt Damon, was unequivocally everything I had hoped it would be. Upon viewing the trailer while waiting to watch The Muppets, there were tears in my eyes and my heart skipped a beat as I remembered I wasn't watching the film itself, just the preview.

1 January 2012,SoloHero5,7," Stop comparing to Jerry Maguire! This is a great family film.
","We bought a zoo is a great movie to go see with the family. Damon flaunts his emotional acting abilities with great form but the stage stealer is young Maggie Elizebeth Jones playing Damon's seven year old daughter. Jones is an eccentric little girl who is bound to bring laughter and Aww's out of you. Elle Fanning does a great job as always; Tomas Haden Church plays his perfect role, and Scarlett Johansson levels things out very nicely.",/review/rw2607914/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2022,planktonrules,8," One of the few family films that should appeal to everyone.
","Often when I see the term 'family movie', it's actually NOT referring to a film the entire family will love but a film which is designed to appeal to kids. But in the case of ""We Bought the Zoo"" I could see folks of all ages enjoying this picture. Part of it might just be that the basic story is based on real people...and that sure didn't hurt the movie.",/review/rw2607914/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2012,alienator345,8," An Inspiring Family Film
","This holiday season brought audiences several great movie options to see. Out of all of them, earlier today I believe I shave seen my favorite. Not War Horse, Sherlock Holmes, Tintin, Mission Impossible, or Alvin and the Chipmunks. The winner is We Bought a Zoo. Now to be fair, I haven't seen Mission Impossible 4, but despite all the great things I've heard about it, I don't think it will strike a chord with me like We Bought a Zoo did. It is such an inspirational story with a powerful message. And it gets quite emotional in several spots. Now I'm not an emotional person typically and I've never actually cried in a movie, but this movie almost broke me. My mom, who cries a lot during movies, certainly was crying in a few spots, so its a tearjerker.",/review/rw2607914/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2012,tavm,7," We Bought a Zoo is a nice heartwarming family drama starring Matt Damon and directed by Cameron Crowe
","A heartwarming family drama was not something I expected from either Matt Damon or director Cameron Crowe but when I ended up watching this with my movie theatre-working friend today, that's what I got and to tell the truth, I actually liked what I saw. Whatever conflict arises in such a not-so-intense film mostly arises between that of Damon and his teenage son who hasn't completely gotten over the death of his mother. There's also some amusing scenes featuring that of the inspector played by John Michael Higgins. Oh, and Scarlett Johansson as the potential love interest was also pretty good. Really, all I'll say now is if you like this kind of thing, I highly recommend We Bought a Zoo.",/review/rw2607914/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2012,StevePulaski,8," We needed one good zoo movie of the year
","It's a shame that We Bought a Zoo got stuck with such a trite, gimmicky title because it's actually a surprising piece of work from a director whose career has been devoted to making dramas with heartwarming characters, we later feel for and grow fond of. Cameron Crowe's simple, yet incredibly well done drama Say Anything... is one of the few non-John Hughes films to be awarded ""The Brat Pack"" stamp, and his drama Almost Famous has garnered a worthy following of the years.",/review/rw2607914/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2015,tieman64,," 20 seconds of courage
","Cameron Crowe's ""We Bought a Zoo"" stars Matt Damon as a Benjamin Mee, a single father who purchases a dilapidated zoo. With the help of his son, daughter and a gang of likable eccentrics, Benjamin attempts to reopen the zoo ahead of a crushing deadline.",/review/rw2607914/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2021,UniqueParticle,10," Love this movie so much!
","Cameron Crowe made such a special tranquil experience that is heartwarming and entertaining always. I've seen at least 25 times in the last decade I just wasn't reviewing back. The family, dialogue and soundtrack are magnificent! I think it's great that Patrick Fugit was in Almost Famous 11 years before this. The cast is perfect, I should buy the movie I own a few hundred others.",/review/rw2607914/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2011,DICK STEEL,8," A Nutshell Review: We Bought a Zoo
","6 years. It's been that long since Cameron Crowe last did a feature film in Elizabethtown, before taking that long a hiatus and coming back with a bang this year through his documentary Pearl Jam 20 that chronicled the life and times of the Seattle based alternative rock band, and We Bought a Zoo, a family drama filled with all the good themes necessary for a year end celebration. If you're as big a fan as I am, there's always this feel good factor in his films, together with that whimsical feel and that inevitable touch of romance.",/review/rw2607914/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2012,Ryan_MYeah,5," It was at least well intentioned, but could it have been ANY more cloying?
","At the end of the day, I found myself underwhelmed by We Bought a Zoo. I really wanted to care for it more than I did, but somewhere during the filming of this movie, the emotional response I should have had just got lost by the film makers. Cameron Crowe at least puts good effort into his direction. His photography is lovely, the music by Jonsi is wonderful (Especially the beautiful ending song ""Gathering Stories""), and Matt Damon, as always, gives a great performance, earning honest sympathy.",/review/rw2607914/?ref_=tt_urv

",Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) is still struggling with the loss of his wife. His son Dylan has been expeled from school. He decides to move his family.

8 May 2013,kosmasp,6," Crowe made a movie about a zoo
","Cameron Crowe is a good director. Even a ridiculous plot like the one we get served here, is handled with great care. Of course he knows that you have to make it as light as possible and make fun of yourself too. Matt Damon is a good choice as a main actor. I like Scarlett too, but she's too obvious and the chemistry isn't perfect. It does build throughout the movie and she also spells out why she doesn't live another life, but it's all too shallow.",/review/rw2607914/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2011,jdesando,," This zoo smells.
","Something smelly there is about the zoo in We Bought a Zoo, and it's not the animals. It's the script that requires many tissues for audience tears and apparently doesn't much care that it ranks as the sappiest film of 2011.",/review/rw2607914/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2011,Reel_starz,8," Sunshine. People. Joy.
","Why should I like We Bought a Zoo? On paper, Cameron Crowe's latest self-discovery romance is a mess: it's sentimental, manipulative and self-conscious – no different from countless other inspirational family movies, from 2008's Marley and Me to 2011's inexplicably successful Dolphin Tale. And yet, against all logic, We Bought a Zoo doesn't fall into that trap. The difference between this and, say, The Blind Side, is that in the former, at least for the most part, the romanticism feels genuine, not a cheap method of pandering to parents in search of a family-friendly movie (for the record, I don't imagine that many children will find We Bought a Zoo all that interesting, despite numerous shots of animals). Thanks to a capable cast, Crowe's spirited direction and, of course, the pitch-perfect soundtrack, We Bought a Zoo is far better than it has any right to be.",/review/rw2607914/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2012,sayloroct,3," All heart, no head
","This is the kind of movie that used to be marketed with the ad line, ""The feel-good movie of the year."" If you like such movies you will probably like this. If you expect more from a movie, like plot and coherent character development, plausible scenes, etc. the your response will likely be somewhat mixed.",/review/rw2607914/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2012,Bob-45,7," Charming, but uneasy walk between ""family film"" and drama
","I could give ""We bought a Zoo"" my ""7"" rating based just on the performances of actresses Scarlett Johansson, Maggie Elizabeth Jones and Elle Fanning. Until know, I've found the voluptuous Jahansson surprisingly resistible. However, here adorned with unattractive clothing concealing her more notable features, Johannson resorts to facial expressions and real acting to win appeal and it works. Maggie Elizabeth Jones delivers the most memorable performance by a seven year old girl since Drew Barrymore gave us ""Gertie"" in ""E.T."". Director Cameron Crowe must have recognized this, given the ""E.T."" homage, when he has Jones buried among the stuffed animals. Finally, Elle Fanning's ethereal beauty of both body and spirit is the first to match Elizabeth Taylor's ""Velvet Brown"" in nearly 70 years.",/review/rw2607914/?ref_=tt_urv
