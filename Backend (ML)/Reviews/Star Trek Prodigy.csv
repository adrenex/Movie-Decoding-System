1 July 2019,Keemshave,9," Mentally and emotionally draining experience.
","Expertly crafted, acted, and directed. Linklater obviously hits the nail on the head in all technical film making aspects. This film drained me though...I mean talk about a jarring experience. Rooting for the fantasy love that the first 2 films portrayed really set me up for resentment of a scene late in the film. Everything about it was realistic and thought-provoking but it was upsetting. I'm glad the ending provided hope for the future. I believe they stay together. Love isn't perfect, but its love nonetheless and finding true love like the love Jesse and celine have is rare. I just cant see myself going back and enjoying this film nearly as much as Sunrise and Sunset. Maybe as I age, I will appreciate more aspects of the arguments presented in the film. Yet, I still really appreciated the daring direction this film went in and it kept me on the edge of my seat.",/review/rw3183875/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2013,ClaytonDavis,10," Before Midnight is a Masterpiece (****)
","Before Midnight is a different type of animal this time around. I didn't expect the team could top an already beautiful story but what they achieve in the newest installment is the most accurate and authentic portrayals of love since Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004). The film is an absolute marvel, showcasing the very best dialogue and capturing the sheer essence of acting brilliance from stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Director Richard Linklater has also created the crowning work of his directorial career, showing incredible restraint and focus on two characters that still feel just as new and fresh as the day we met them. The film opens with a near fifteen minute take that gets its hook into you and never lets up. It's a cinematic sensation. ",/review/rw3183875/?ref_=tt_urv

25 October 2013,larrys3,5," Liked It the Least of the Three
","I liked the first two films of these interconnected movies ""Before Sunrise""(1995) and ""Before Sunset""(2004). I've always liked Ethan Hawke's acting and I thought the scripts were full of life and fresh dialog. I felt that way for maybe 1/2 of this latest film and then, for me, it just deteriorated into one long argument between the two protagonists, often accompanied by vicious barbs and personal verbal attacks. I thought for a moment I was back watching ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"", from decades before.",/review/rw3183875/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2013,flydocfly,10," Third time's a Charm!
","I just saw this amazing movie at its Sundance premiere. It's wonderful on so many levels I don't know where to start. The performances are fantastic. If Julie Delpy doesn't get an Oscar nomination it would be a shame (the only stupider thing the Academy could do is have 10 best picture nominations.) Ethan Hawke's performance is brilliant in its own way, however, it's a less showy part and I'm not certain it'll get the recognition it deserves. ",/review/rw3183875/?ref_=tt_urv

",It's 9 years after 'Before Sunset' in the 3rd movie of the Before series. Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) are unmarried living in Paris with their twin daughters. Jesse has written 2 more books. It's one of the last days of their summer vacation in Greece. Jesse sees his son Hank off after spending the summer with him. Hank's mom is still angry and Jesse wants so much to spend more time with him in Chicago. Celine is thinking about taking a government job with complications.,/review/rw3183875/?ref_=tt_urv

15 May 2013,soncoman,8," Two Hours of Talk, Talk, Talk... and Absolutely Enthralling...
","The 56th San Francisco International came to a close at the magnificent Castro Theatre with a showing of Richard Linklater's ""Before Midnight"", the third in Linklater's series of ""Before"" films. Preceded by ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"", the film continues the story of Jesse and Celine, now a middle-aged, two child couple on vacation in Greece. Things are not quite right between the two, and there is much to be said between them. So they talk. For two hours. And it is absolutely enthralling.",/review/rw3183875/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2013,Sergeant_Tibbs,9," The mere idea that Jesse and Celine have days like ""Before Midnight"" everyday is more overwhelming than an epic drama.
","The first time I saw Before Sunrise and Before Sunset I didn't think  much to them. I thought it was a cute concept to revisit characters,  particularly with the irony that Jesse wrote about Before Sunrise but  it wasn't until a rewatch when they opened up. I wish more films were  two interesting people talking and walking through beautiful cities,  especially if they can be as breezy and rewarding as Before Sunset. So  now that I'm a fan, I was excited for Before Midnight and felt that it  could tie the knot that the first two left loose. It did. Midnight is  definitely the funniest and most hard-hitting film I've seen in a long  while. In the other films I've found their existential conversations  interesting but it's never felt like they've dug their fingers in my  brain like this film. It feels like a mirror of my feelings. In a  single shot they articulate all the transient anxieties I have about  the world and life in a more profound way than I could've achieved in  my lifetime. With its real-time gap in time between films with events  and moments only left to the imagination of the viewer, that element of  reality is fascinating. The mere idea that Jesse and Celine have days  like Before Midnight everyday is more overwhelming than an epic drama.  But beyond the fiction, there's a scene where Julie Deply is topless  through a range of emotional tones which adds an extra strange element  of reality that the other films don't have regarding the chemistry  between the leads. As Ethan Hawke suckles on Julie Deply's nipple, the  idea of an intimate relationship between Hawke and Deply in reality  lifts the fiction of Jesse and Celine to a new realm of emotional  impact, especially considering the sharpness of their argument scene.  Midnight has one of the best endings I've seen and if it left it at the  penultimate scene, I would've been far too wrecked. The humour is just  so poignant and wonderful and true. On a technical level, the film is  terrific considering their choices of where to set conversations and  how they're executed in long shots. I loved the way the score for the  film was adapted from Celine's ""Waltz For A Night"" song from the end of  Sunset. As always, the acting is genuine and charming and while it  struggles to adapt to the barrage of side characters at first, they do  have something fascinating to say. Before Midnight is draining but  thoroughly enlightening and satisfying. I have no hesitation in calling  it the best of everyone's careers and best of the year unless anything  else hits me harder.  9/10",/review/rw3183875/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2013,KineticSeoul,5," Least favorite from the three
","Despite the positive ratings this one has been getting. It's still my least favorite out of the three films. This time it leads more towards the changing of times, life after marriage, and rationality vs. emotions. When it comes to the past films in this franchise, both Jesse and Celine brought out some interesting points. But this time Celine is the dis-likable character. Maybe because I am a guy, but she just comes off as a bully that is super into the the feminist movement. She basically wants Jesse to bend over backwards in order for her to be satisfied. I don't know, this time around the back and forth conversation just seems more depressing and uncomfortable. Than amusing and intriguing, thus it feels drawn out. I won't be watching this one again, plus it lacks substance compared to the previous two installments. And seeing how it ends, there will probably be another installment. If not, this is just plain out depressing even if it relates to real life to a degree.",/review/rw3183875/?ref_=tt_urv

6 April 2017,xeniamotsou,9," So realistically good, it hurts!
","I, personally, am from Greece, so I was curious to see how they would introduce Greek people and our culture. I have to say I am very happy with the result. Even though it's the third movie, they managed to keep it interesting, with smart dialogues still not missing from the script. It was really fascinating how they inserted Greek habits and parts of everyday life, without it seeming forced or unnecessary. I really liked how they presented the different ideas of love in each movie. ""Before Sunrise"" showing us young, innocent love, ""Before Sunset"" displaying the difficulties you face as an adult being confused about what you really want for your love life, and finally ""Before Midnight"". In this film they successfully introduce to the viewer the phase in two people's lives, where they have settled down and try to deal with some of the problems a married couple with kids could encounter. The lead actors had great on-screen chemistry once again, achieving to realistically present us these situations. Overall, I believe that it's a smart, entertaining movie with so much to offer. I truly recommend it.",/review/rw3183875/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2013,generationfilm,9," Before Midnight- A Logical and Equally Emotional Continuation of the Romantic Saga that is Uncomfortably Truthful and Painfully Heartfelt
","Despite what idealized viewers might think when it comes to their beloved romance films there are numerous events and circumstances that can occur outside the frame that could strengthen, fracture, or challenge that particular relationship beyond the assumed happily ever after conclusion. This idea behind continued uncertainty is essentially called life and though the realist perspective might damage some optimist hopes there is a genuine beauty to the wonderful truth that is a relationship that cultivates or fissures in the face life's challenges. Eclectic filmmaker Richard Linklater, known for such diverse films such as his debut indie feature Slacker and his wide appeal comedy School of Rock, understood the idea of life beyond the ending credits once he reintroduced his two romantic leads Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) with a chance encounter in Before Sunset after their initial meeting nine years earlier in Before Sunrise. Before Midnight, the latest chapter of this ingenious film series, offers the creative staples that the romantic saga is known for with Linklater's consistently delicate observational style, Hawke and Delpy's engaged performances, philosophical witty banter relating to relationships, life, and more but this time unfolding the details of a relationship that has marinated beyond its initial romantic beginnings and changed into something far more palpable, strained, and relatable. The collaborative writing between Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy demonstrates their immense understanding of their created characters and deliver their most uncomfortably emotional and richly life-affirming vignette in this particular reflective road stop in the lives of Jesse and Celine. When poet John Keats wrote the famous last line ""truth is beauty, beauty truth"" in his poem ""An Ode to a Grecian Urn"" he realized that even the most unpleasant truths had intense beauty in its mere recognized existence and the Before saga is one of the purest cinematic exercises in revealing that kind of beautiful truth. Before Midnight takes the initially romantic setups in Before Sunrise and Before Sunset and expands them into their most logical and equally emotional prolongation where it expands the narrative strength, character vivacity, and philosophical importance of the series into a fully realized and painfully heartfelt whole that speaks uncomfortable truths in an engagingly entertaining way.",/review/rw3183875/?ref_=tt_urv

If you have, then you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. This movie is driven by the characters and their dialog.

12 January 2014,sddavis63,3," I'm Cutting This A Bit Of Slack
","I have decided that I have to cut this movie at least a little bit of slack. Although I sometimes think that the rating on here are ridiculous, when over 41,000 people have given this a ranking of over 8, I'll admit the possibility that it must have something going for it. Mainly, I'm going to admit that because I realize that this is the third of a trilogy - a trilogy of which I was completely unaware. My wife rented this without knowing that actually. Had I known of the trilogy I would probably have suggested watching the first two before getting into this. But I didn't, she didn't, and so we rented this.
