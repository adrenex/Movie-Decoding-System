6 April 2016,Tweekums,7," Atmospheric if somewhat clichéd chiller
","This chiller in centred on hospice assistant Caroline Ellis; she has become somewhat disenchanted with the place she works to replies to an advert for a live-in carer at an old plantation house deep in the bayous. When she gets there she meets Violet Devereaux and her husband Benjamin; he has suffered a stroke and can't care for himself it will be Caroline's job to look after him for his remaining days. Shortly after arriving she is given a skeleton key that opens every door in the house. She finds a door in the attic that it won't open; Mrs Devereaux explains that the room hasn't been entered since she and her husband moved in several decades ago. Caroline manages to get into the room and discovers various spells, potions and other hoodoo paraphernalia. It turns out the room originally belonged to Mama Cecile and Papa Justify; two servants who had been lynched ninety years before. She investigates further and starts to believe that Mrs Devereaux is responsible for what happened to her husband and that she too is in real danger.",/review/rw3330368/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2020,filipemanuelneto,7," It doesn't scare, but it entertains.
","I am an avowed fan of horror films but I must confess that films with haunted houses are so common that it gradually became uninteresting. Still, there's nothing like giving new material a chance. That's what I did here. And I was reasonably satisfied: its a film that knows how to build atmosphere and tension and a pleasant mystery, even if its not capable of frightening.",/review/rw3330368/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2005,WriterDave,7," They Do that Hoodoo that they Do so...eh, Relatively Well
","Horror movies have become a dime a dozen in the past few years. The watchable ones seem to fall into two categories of late: misguided psychological thrillers headlined by a consummate actress (witness Naomi Watts in ""The Ring 2"" or Jennifer Connelly in ""Dark Water"") or over the top slasher/gore-fests with serious kitsch value (witness Romero's enjoyable zombie flick ""Land of the Dead"" or Rob Zombie's sadistic ""Devil's Rejects""). All of the rest have pretty much been unbearable cliché-ridden hack jobs (""White Noise,"" ""Darkness Falls,"" etc...) ",/review/rw3330368/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2005,Coventry,7," Hoodoo!! Whodunit!!
","In case you haven't seen ""The Skeleton Key"" yet, be very careful when reading any reviews... The less you hear, read or even know about this film the better, because I assure that you don't want to pick up any spoilers about this surprisingly original and ingenious horror-story. ""The Skeleton Key"" is an old-fashioned, powerful and  above all  well written haunted house thriller with great acting, macabre scenery and a shocking twist-ending that stands as one of the best I've ever seen in modern cinema. Beautifully set in the swampy region of New Orleans (morbidly enough, I saw this film shortly after the hurricane Katrina disaster), the story introduces a young nurse who moves into the ominous Deveraux mansion to look after its dying owner Ben. He had a nearly-fatal stroke in the dark attic of the house and, even though it looks like it was because of his old age, Caroline soon starts to suspect that something (or someone) nearly frightened him to death. Ben's wife Violet behaves very strangely and the old house's vicious history forces Caroline to investigate what could have happened. She discovers that the earliest occupants of the house practiced Hoodoo, which is a more spiritual variant of Voodoo... That's really all you can say about the story without giving away essential clues but, trust me, the rest of the film is definitely worth checking out yourself. Fans of atmospheric ghost stories (such as ""The Others"" or ""Angel Heart"") will particularly enjoy this film as it contains almost no graphic violence or gory monsters. Instead of blood, there's a wide collection of truly eerie set-pieces and subtle frights. Kate Hudson delivers a great performance, especially because she's not really familiar with the horror genre. She receives good feedback from Gena Rowlands, Peter Sarsgaard and  of course  John Hurt. The latter is always genius, even when he hardly has any lines. Highly recommended!",/review/rw3330368/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2005,aharmas,9," still spooked by the ending
","Part of the success of this type of movie is setting up and making sure its resolution lives up to its expectations. I must say that in this film everything seems to work, and yet... I'm not sure what spooked more: its ending or the nature of its ending.",/review/rw3330368/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2021,Chance_Boudreaux19,8," Great setting, great atmsophere and an all-time great horror movie ending
","The ending to this movie which I won't spoil is truly one of the best I've encountered in a horror movie. Throughout the runtime I was trying to figure out what the inevitable twist will be but there is no way I could've predicted the wild turn of events that unfolds. The conclusion is what made me raise my rating from a 7 to and 8. Ending notwithstanding it is still a very decent and atmospheric horror movie. I love movies set in New Orleans/Louisiana and am always on the lookout for more and this was a major reason why I watched this. I love it when a Louisiana movie embraces the swampy setting so that you can feel the humidity radiating from the screen. Skeleton Key has a lot of great scenes that establish the setting and showcase the culture and myths of the area. Some say the movie is a bit tame but that's not a problem for me. There are some horror movies that are let down by a PG-13 rating but this is not really a movie that needed an R rating as I can't think of many things that it would have changed apart from adding some unnecessary gore. Additionally, the performances are good but the direction could've maybe been improved to give it more of a creepy vibe as there weren't many actual scenes that had me scared. All in all it doesn't matter too much as Skeleton Key is a very decent and rather underrated horror movie that relies on atmosphere and setting rather than cheap thrills and gore.",/review/rw3330368/?ref_=tt_urv

4 March 2006,claudio_carvalho,8," Finally I Was Able to See an Original and Recent American Horror Movie That Is not a Remake of a Successful Japanese Film!
","The nurse Caroline Ellis (Kate Hudson) decides to quit her job in a hospital and work for a family in the swamps of Terrebone Parish, Louisiana, one hour far from New Orleans. The family lawyer Luke (Peter Sarsgaard) hires her for US$ 1,000.00 per week to take care of Ben Devereaux (John Hurt), the beloved husband of Violet Devereaux (Gena Howlands), who had a stroke and is totally paralyzed. Violet gives a skeleton key of the huge house to Caroline, and the curious young woman finds a secret creepy hoodoo room in a scary attic that belonged to a couple of sorcerers that worked in the house. Caroline, who does not believe in magic, decides to learn about hoodoo, and believes Violet put an evil spell on Ben.

18 December 2020,bowmanblue,9," A rare gem with real chills
","When the Japanese film 'The Ring' got re-made for English-speaking audiences it kind of started a trend of horror movies where a lone female slowly investigates a dark, brooding situation, gradually coming to terms with the supernatural element she's uncovered. 2005's 'The Skeleton Key' is definitely in that bracket, yet whereas so many were pretty forgettable clones of 'The Ring,' this one did so much that was right I really do see it as up there with the best horror films of the genre.",/review/rw3330368/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2006,TxMike,," Voodoo and hoodoo in the Louisiana bayou land.
","I was pleasantly surprised. The actors all create interesting, believable characters, it was filmed in and around areas I am very familiar with, and it has an unusual and creepy story. It was all brought together very well, and I consider it a better movie than its IMDb rating suggests. One of the better recent horror movies.",/review/rw3330368/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2022,mattfrancis-03963,8," Very good from Kate
","I'm not a fan of Kate Hudson the roles she plays and how she plays them whereas this time although an old film now, I was impressed with how she carried this film. Apart from the chilling cliches and eerie storm cliches, there was enough in terms of cinematically, tension and intelligence that went into this. Unlike most other supernatural horror thrillers that all try and copy this one is a stand out.",/review/rw3330368/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2005,MichaelMargetis,6," ""You see things... in the mirrors."" - Violet Devereaux
","The latest psychological thriller, 'The Skeleton Key', follows a young hospice nurse taking care of a disturbed patient in the creepy and swampy bayous of Louisana. Kate Hudson plays the hospice nurse, Caroline. Caroline is a kind, brave but very curious caretaker which gets her into trouble sometimes. When her previous patient passes away, Caroline is sent for to live in a spooky farmhouse in the bayou, and take care of an old senile man, Ben Devereaux (John Hurt - Owning Mahoney) who is pretty much paralyzed from a stroke he recently had. Caroline lives in the house with Ben and his typical old Southern housewife, Violet Devereaux (Gena Rowlands - Hysterical Blindness). Everything seems to be going fine until some freaky stuff starts to happen that isn't easily explained. Violet later tells Caroline the house is haunted with the spirits of slave voodoo enthusiasts. And so starts the creepy tale that is the 'Skeleton Key' with great acting, cool visuals but a lagging screenplay.",/review/rw3330368/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2020,fay_star,8," Familiar But Fresh Gothic Mystery Thriller
","When holywood was churning out soft horrors with top actresses, The Skeleton Key was one of the few that stood the test of time.
It has a very famous lead actress but doesn""t get stuck on traditional girly horror stereotypes. The character is strong, ballsy and smart, and you will her to solve the mystery and save the day.
Kate Hudson is perfectly cast, as are the rest of the main characters. The dialogue is great. The flashbacks and putting together of the clues is done with good timing for the pace of the film.
The setting is perfect and the aesthetic of the film brings everything together as a familiar but fresh gothic mystery thriller.",/review/rw3330368/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2022,Dougmd1974,9," Chilling and creepy - I enjoyed it
","I feel this film is quite underrated. If you can buy into the supernatural theme I think it's worth watching. I bought what they were selling in this fantasy and Kate Hudson was really an unexpected surprise. It just worked for me. It's really one of the better films in this category that's usually filled with junk. If you're ok with this style of film and you don't require a cheesy happy everything's-hunkey-dorey ending, I think you'll like it.",/review/rw3330368/?ref_=tt_urv

19 July 2005,tenten76,6," A solid 6/10 - pushing a 7 because the ending is good.
","Good performances all round. Good locations. Quite a lot of restraint on the writer's/director's part, building the chills in a more classic 70's way than out-and-out ghosts and scares. In fact, a few more scares after the half-way mark would have been welcome; if the ghosts were used any less, they wouldn't be in the film! The reason I've only rated a 6/10, is because it's so predictable. If you've seen any thriller set in the Deep South, you've seen this one. The background story is textbook 'New Orleans' voodoo vengeance, the characters' motives are obvious from the second they appear on screen, and the solid but pedestrian cinematography means that the locations are massively underused. If you've got a decrepit colonial mansion with antique furniture, surrounded by swamps and trees draped in that Lianna/lichen stuff, you've got to be pretty boring NOT to make it all seem brooding & scary - which is unfortunately what they've done.",/review/rw3330368/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2005,olin2359,9," Why the twist at the end was disturbing
",I thought this movie was great because of the twist at the end. I have seen this movie a few times and 2 out of 3 people miss the most creepy and disturbing part of the whole movie. The funny thing about this movie is that the sacrifices all started with the children of the wealthy banker. Papa Justify and Mama Cecile took over the children's bodies during the party and then the people at the party hung and burned the children thinking it was the servants. That in itself was disturbing. They then shot the wealthy banker and his wife and took over the house and lived there until they took over the new couples bodies in 1962.,/review/rw3330368/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2005,AlanJ2,8," Really good, also original
","After a slightly slow start, 'Skeleton Key' develops into an original, evocative and at times genuinely scary occult thriller so Ehren Kruger has redeemed himself after his truly wretched script for 'Ring 2' . I am not going into spoilers, which would be extremely destructive for a film of this kind but there are very clever character shifts, achieving a wonderful tension lock for the last 40 minutes or so mainly because all the performances are so good. The use of props and flash-backs is also wonderfully rich. The setting is contemporary New Orleans and its surrounds but this is mythical south and none the worse for that. The mix of influences includes 'Turn of the Screw', 'Rosemary's Baby' 'Burn Witch Burn and a few other classics but that is to give nothing away for it absorbs them into something quite new. My only criticism would be there is something a little confined about the movie--especially at its start-- but its style and pace and excitement utilise this triumphantly by the end.",/review/rw3330368/?ref_=tt_urv

31 August 2005,Superunknovvn,6," Avoids clichés for the most part but fails to create a spooky atmosphere
","The first thing you notice about ""The Skeleton Key"" is that it doesn't start like almost every horror movie these days. There's no shocking opening sequence and for the first 15 minutes or so nothing supernatural happens. The movie starts by introducing its characters and that's very refreshing. In fact, I had great expectations after that slow start. I mean when was the last time a horror movie (or psychological thriller, if you want) has really taken the time to build up a proper story? For the most part the movie manages to steer clear of typical horror clichés, but now and then the makers seemed to feel the urge to put in a totally predictable and unnecessary jump for the sake of not making the whole thing too boring. That's the one major problem of ""The Skeleton Key"".",/review/rw3330368/?ref_=tt_urv
