26 December 2022,pal-gandharv,10," Pioneer of webseries culture in India, set a great example
","Believe me, they started from where they left off in season 1. Probably the pioneer of webseries this has been but believe me that the team behind Pitchers has done a lot of homework to cover all the intricacies of startups. From beer to whiskey now, from the idea of a startup to running that startup now, these guys seem to reach a next level. Missing Jeetu for obvious reasons as he brings the desi pana of coders which I personally co-relate to. Baap of all Indian webseries. Claiming it confidently. With more than 7 or 8 years gap, they came with a nuclear bomb that isnt just gonna shake the new India but revolutionize the webseries department once again. All minds of TVF have come to one place and that is, Pitchers. A must must watch. 9.5/10. I can proudly say that this Indian silicon valley is way better than America's. And they have done it without Jeetu. Woh aayega to bhuchaal aa jayega kasam se. Wont give spoilers.",/review/rw3308861/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2015,dhruvchandra,10," Something refreshing..
","Its one of the coolest TV series ever produced. Just love watching it. Keep it up guys..!! Its something i look forward to watch after my tiring day. It provides you with great fun and entertainment along with a crisp of events. A must watch for today's tech generation. It looks to be promising with excellent performances by its actors Very good directing skills to make it look authenticating and compare with day to day life. Naveen, Jitu, Yogi and Mandal ensure they don't make it look an over the top series. Hats off to TVF for coming up with such an interesting topic and projecting this concept as many people, especially Indian individual , are opting for this future and making it big. Well Done..Keep it up..",/review/rw3308861/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2015,shashankapr,10," Inspiring and entertaining at the same time!
","This is one of those rare things which relaxes a part of you by its entertainment (rather sensible, no nonsense entertainment) and awakens one part of you to think about what you are actually doing with your own life. Its funny, its serious, its inspiring, its REAL, its a 100 more things I can't describe. Personally, what I like most is the respect with which TVF Pitchers treats its audience. When I watch this series I feel good when they present such intelligent comedy and so REAL story line. Thank you TVF for NOT insulting your audience like Mainstream serials in India do and for NOT treating them as idiots who can not understand anything as Mainstream movies in India do. Keep it Up!!! And yes, please bring the finale episode soon man!:)",/review/rw3308861/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2015,akshaydba,10," Must watch for everybody
",Excellent attempt by TVF to capture the real life of IT professionals in India who are aspiring for startups. Direction is awesome and performances by all the actors do not make it boring experience.,/review/rw3308861/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2015,bisalsinghnayal,10," Inspiring and Real...!!!
","I have been a follower of TVF since their ""Permanent roommates"" series. You guys are nailing it down one by one...!!!. The best thing, majority of the Indian population is able to relate themselves to your series :). Many guys do wanna take the leap of faith with startups but they are afraid. Hope your series inspires us so that this fear of failure can be crushed.",/review/rw3308861/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2015,namanbanaudha,10," Absolute Magic
","I think to cut a long story short, India has the capability of making this kind of Serial, Fantastic Story line, Naveen Bansal Speech in 4th episode truly breath taking, Jitu and his dad add spark and at the same time that how much a child still cares of his father, yogi brilliant Comic timing!! A Must watch for all professionals.And not to forget the IIM guy Mandal, who looks so innocent and at the same time acting a backbone of for the whole team. One things that this serial has set apart that it has covered every genre that IT professional goes through from his college days to Career, they give themselves motivation to strive for the . Hats off to the Screenplay, each character has been portrait to absolute certainty. Way to go TVF, you guys are doing a magnificent job :)",/review/rw3308861/?ref_=tt_urv

9 July 2015,aditya-kaul-ak,10," Refreshing series
","i've been following TVF since quite long...they have always managed to come up with unique concepts and sketches, unlike qtiyapa, tech convo wid dad, permanent roommates, this is more intense and quite evolving one...each character is so well developed that it has that 'factor' that makes u think about the possibilities and again make u, as a viewer, relate with one's life...I wish u guys all the very best n yes, to the '#qutiyaguy...aka arunabh...i too wish to see this series on par or better than entourage...kudos guys!!!...n bisso..aka...biswapati sarkar...some one will definitely mention u as his/her inspiration for their start up!!! :)",/review/rw3308861/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2015,lokesh_mogra,10," I am not sure if calling it amazing will be sufficient
","Comic, Its so casual and real. Brilliant actors. The entire is so very Inspiring. I must have watched it what some 25 times each episode. Brilliant Job TVF, ""Yogi"" u are a comic master man, hast off. Naveens jury room explanation and the speech, was awesome. But the thing that makes me love it are the detailing. like brining the real startup founders to act in it, the bechdel test. The Box8 thing, u know when i opened Box8 site for curosity it was crawling for 5 minutes. Gary in his short stint was brilliant too. Mandal and Jitu are also amazing. And cherry on the cap was the entry of Biswapati Sarkar. I am a die hard fan of his comic timing, i love the chai-sutta cronicles. Waiting for the next episodes to come.",/review/rw3308861/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2021,devdenim,10," Watched after 6 years of release.. I wonder why..Awesome
","Do yourself a favour .. watch this and appreciate true ""Content"". Then watch Kota Factory. Then wonder why you were not aware of TVF's free web series on YouTube. Then you will remember that you were off loaded with garbage from KJo Salman and entire Bollywood. Their marketing was so strong that these small timers tvf were lost somewhere.. even with 80 lakhs subscribers till date.",/review/rw3308861/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wow! Just Outstanding concept! The way director present all the IT jobbers it was so exceptional. It was so entertaining. The dialogues are so reliable. Screenplay is so fantastic. All the actors specially lead 4 actors done their best. Definitely it will teach you the lesson of life. There are few dialogues which are the all time best one of this like jab Graduates apni 9 to 5 job se bore hote hai wo 3 hi chiz ki taraf jate hai. MBA, IAS ya Start up. The final Presentation scene was the highlight point of this series. A Must watch for every entrepreneur or normal person!",/review/rw3308861/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,sunilcool-13293,10," Fantastic show by tvf team
","Just finished watching season 2. And I must say the show had roller coaster of emotions which a founder go through during his struggle days. The chemistry between all the characters is still intact like seasons 1. Missed seeing jeetu in season 2. Great work from the creators. Thanks for making season 2. Naveen, mandal and Yogi rocked life before in the show. Lot of entrepreneurial lessons in same show. How much sacrifices and cost it needs to build owns dream. Everyone in the show deserves a great thanks who acted, supported and directed. Hope to see more seasons coming in future. It would recommend this show to everyone.",/review/rw3308861/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is my second series I am watching of TVF. 'Pitchers'. Will always remember and loved the dialogue, ""We are not Entrepreneurs, We are Pitchers""...

26 December 2022,himamlai,10," Season 2 of TVF Pitchers is awesome series.
","Arunabh kumar is a genius. The real world of start-up has been shown in a crystal clear way. I had tears in my eyes while seeing these episodes. I also loved the role of Mandal. He is definitely one of the most important pillar of team Pragati. Naveen has also justified his role in a very realistic way. Special kudos to Bhati Saab, Is there any role which you cannot play? He did a fantastic job. All the TVF team is doing a great job in OTT industry. I wish you good luck. Keep up the good work, I will keep watching all of your shows for sure. You guys are the future of Indian cinema. Congratulations!",/review/rw3308861/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2015,bhatt-parantap,8," Simply put- e^x (Exponential Rise) but slightly overrated
","The exponential rise of the online content in India owes it to TVF in delivering impeccable quality in material, production value and performance. Complimenting the rise of The Viral Fever Media Labs, TVF Pitchers starts with a good note and ends on a summit. ",/review/rw3308861/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2021,Puroo,9," The first thing that comes to my mind when I think of TVF
","Back when this web series came everyone in my school and coaching centre were going crazy. Me being me, was only interested in studies plus I had a feature phone so I didn't watch it back then. Plus its name didn't appeal me either (pitcher, seriously? What's this show about, pottery?). So finally when I got a phone and I didn't have money to get an actual streaming service, I decided to download TVF Play and watch this over there. And I do have to admit, this is the best web series on the entire platform. In fact it's the first thing I think of when someone says TVF.",/review/rw3308861/?ref_=tt_urv

A departmental store scene b/w Naveen and his lover.
Jeethu's wife explanation to her father in law about startup.
Saurabh's presentation and following scenes with him

31 August 2015,omnipresent-42657,10," very refreshing
","we love anything from TVF. we have been following from the very beginning . The actors ,the reality connection to every youth in India. The IT life, frustrated young generation to find their passion but yet connected to the roots of Indian cutler the father son relation, arranged marriage working out are shown well. The general Indian men thinking of wife not getting the job my husband has been showing the TVF videos to all the guest. Even friends as if we are the brand ambassador's of the show. good direction. good story and characterization. The final episode was too good. The college students acting was little unnatural though.",/review/rw3308861/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2015,clearwinner,8," A Realistic One
","Pitchers shows the reality of start-ups in India. It portrays the start-up culture in India. It gives us an insight into the life of the people involved in a start-up. The best things in he series. Chemistry of Naveen and Shreya is too good. The writer Biswapati Sarkar deserves a mention here for his fabulous writing. Jitu who has always been my favorite again proves his mettle here. He delivered spectacular performance as a husband, as a son and the final episode clash with hostelers was really spectacular. After that scene I saw a smile on his face and I didn't think that was a part of the scene. Never mind. Yogi as a bully delivered good but his character was under-written. Mandal supposed to be a bother so that he could introduce comedy did not work for me. It was not subtle and I felt it was specifically introduced to bring some humor in the series. I had stopped watching TVF videos for quite some time, even I have not watched Permanent Roommates. I watched its first episode for some 10 minutes and it felt the same old jokes of TVF. The same occasional pauses, similar kind of puns. Actually the puns are the things which made me dislike TVF(the puns were the thing which hooked me to TVF). TVF repeated similar kind of puns in each of their content. Suddenly it became predictable. They converted facebook,whatsapp jokes to scenes. It was quite depressing but with TVF Pitchers they have showed they can perform better. Looking ahead to some better projects form TVF. If possible try inviting the AIB guys as well. I am really a big fan of AIB.",/review/rw3308861/?ref_=tt_urv
