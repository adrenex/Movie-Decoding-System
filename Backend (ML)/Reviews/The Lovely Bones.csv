19 December 2016,Manal1987,9," Sorrentino's The Young Pope is not the papal House of Cards
","I was among many others who rushed to compare Paolo Sorrentino's Vatican drama The Young Pope to Beau Willimon's political masterpiece House of Cards after watching the first couple of episodes of the former. Obviously, I was wrong. Despite the unmistakable similarities between the enigmatic newly-elected young American pope Lenny Belardo, a.k.a. Pius XIII, and the evil mastermind statesman Frank Underwood, both shows aim at two completely distinctive targets, and although it is true that institutional religion and politics share so much in common in terms of manipulation and intrigue, Willimon and Belardo evidently play different tunes to approach such thorny issues.",/review/rw3732058/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2016,feelinesound,10," Light, funny, strange, beautiful and utterly original
","I guess I should start with what I don't like about this show - the dialogue is somewhat unnatural. There's no umming or erring at all, conversations are as rapid and resolute as in an American crime procedural, which is slightly weird most of the time but especially disturbing when coming from actors who aren't speaking in their first language, who happen to make up the vast majority of actors on this show.

17 November 2016,MoviecriticElyn,9," An eccentric extravagant BEAUTIFUL project
","To tell the truth, when heard about the TV series of a young pope, I was absolutely sure it is a documentary one so I did not do any search beforehand. Well then, after I saw the first episode, I immediately wikipedied and googled PiusXIII, only to discover he has never existed (yet). To tell the truth again, I wanted to stop watching the series because usually i do not like something blown up out of the blue, like The Walking dead, f.e. But, captured of the very good quality of acting, nice music and extremely eccentric character of the Pope, I watched the second episode, then the third...and you know what? IT GOES better and better!!! I am fully immersed with my head and heart in these TV series. So far I am in love with 4th and 8th episode. Especially when the Pope gives his speech on peace. It is more than touching, it is perfect. On the whole, the project is fully in line with the Sorrentino's oscared movie ""Grande Bellezza"", touching music, knife-sharp changes in the editing pieces of the film, smart dialogues, and much more...so that corruption of everyone, low or high, just goes in the background. Highly recommended!",/review/rw3732058/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2016,stefan-soos,10," Sensational
","Wow, don't think i ever been that impressed by the first two episodes of a TV series. The story line doesn't sound that innovative: young, unknown American cardinal becomes pope surprisingly but instead of being a puppet for the powerful cardinals in the background, he is trying to take the vatican over completely. Now this could be just another vatican drama or another over the top comedy about the church...but its something very different. Jude Laws portrayal of the young pope is certainly one of the better acting performances I've seen in a while. he is cold, stoic but also full of rage and passionate about his convictions and most important: you cant figure him out. one minute you think he is a complete jerk or insane, next you believe that he is a saint. the cinematography and music is excellent. some of the mass scenes could have been shot better but thats nit picking.",/review/rw3732058/?ref_=tt_urv

26 February 2017,AlsExGal,10," Who IS this guy?...
","...Just as the people of Gotham wondered who Batman was, what made him what he was, I wonder who IS Pope Pius XIII. He is Machiavellian, he has no problems humiliating people such as the Italian prime minister, and boasting about it to a journalist, telling her the secret to humiliating someone is to not let them know they've been humiliated. Hardly Christ-like. ",/review/rw3732058/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2016,lawrencet-708-873760,9," Keep watching
","This my first review only because I read two bad reviews and feel it may not have given it real justice. They say it is predictable, uninspiring, trying to be something original. That being said it is probably true to a degree but you have to keep watching. At first all these things are presented too show the facade of what we already know - the scandals - but it fades and introduces new questions. For someone who bores at the fact of church going this was rather intriguing. Jude Law is great as the young American pope. I feel he plays with the subtle conflicts so well; vanity, power, pious yet struggles, scathing but is a visionary.",/review/rw3732058/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2019,braquecubism,10," Masterpiece - totally original, witty, creative
","Some love it, some hate it- I can understand that- I LOVE it. truly genius & original. that's also why it can be hard to understand at 1st, what's happening and what Sorrentino is going for. I didn't think the story was tired (some of the nay critics) and as it goes along, it is very original. Diane Keaton is a nun, what do you expect in the catholic church- Jude Law is an enigma.
1st time I watched the 1st episode, I didn't know what I had seen. I had to go back and watch it again. the interest builds- I found this so interesting and engaging. this is truly something new and original.
If you love the Catholic church, you won't like this.
The scenery and the art direction is truly wonderful. This is not a lucky accident. it's talent & creativity. I am not the biggest Jude Law fan, till this. Diane Keaton is wonderful in a role she deserves (she's been in some turkeys as of late, not much for a woman over 60 out there).
Next miniseries, the New Pope, has John Malkovich in the lead, truly one of my least favorite, over-rated actors. Disappointed. I just hope they don't let him do an accent!!!!
as for Sorrentino, he can be uneven, in his work. He can be unexpected. those who take chances, sometimes they fail. This is in my opinion, a big success. also, he is a truly skilled craftsman, understanding film.",/review/rw3732058/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2016,paul-15242,9," Well balanced, beautifully written script, plenty of fun.
","It was everything I was hoping for, great set, awesome cast. Lots of swish vocabulary being delivered and not overdone. My thoughts after 30 minutes were ""This is going to be Boardwalk Empire in the Vatican"" and more. That's not to say that this is like anything done before, more, totally hasn't been done before, and instead of the huge music scores and frowning gown clergy, you get an unpredictable drama, plenty of humour and some wonderfully shot scenes - None of which distract. Jude Law plays the Pope like your father plays the villain when you have a friend over - His vindictive nature is apparent and has you rubbing your hands for the next time the Pope wants to single somebody out... He suffers no fools... Watch it folks, it's fantastic!",/review/rw3732058/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2016,Kirpianuscus,," provocative
","its basic virtue - it is a provocative series. because it could be perceived as blasphemy. or honest perspective about Romano- Catholic Church. because it could be discovered as free adaptation of Karamazov Brothers. or as next step of the successor of Francis I. because it seems more than fiction. and it is a refined embroidery of themes about Vatican who becomes more shining in the new light. Jude Law is Pius XIII. the role is the perfect clothes for him and nobody could be imagine in the lead role. Diane Keaton does an interesting role. maybe, too interesting, remembering Borgia series. it is a provocative project. this is its virtue and its sin. and the basic motif to see a series with, at the first sigh, huge ambitions. like the young pope.because its great virtue is the delicate-precise manner to remind the essence of Christianity. and the fragility of man. it is almost one of the Eastern Orthodox story, maybe, Russian, about faith and its challenges. so, just a provocative series.",/review/rw3732058/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2020,antoniotierno,8," Extremely original
","The Young Pope is one of the most beautiful season of television ever made. Created by Paolo Sorrentino, The Young Pope is set in the Vatican, which is in Rome, and shot in Venice. The story is told efficiently, different from the traditional plotting, and a lot emphases isnput on the visual style, intense wit and deep character examination. Jude Law is perfect, as well as James Cronwell and Diane Keaton. Surely unlikely but totally genial.",/review/rw3732058/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2021,tm-sheehan,8," Magnificent Production. Jude Law is mesmerising
","My Review - The Young Pope- My Rating 8/10
This magnificently filmed series wouldn't be everyone's choice of an evening's entertainment. It took me 2 attempts to appreciate its Avant- Garde style and underlying sarcasm and dark humour.
On 14 July 2017, The Young Pope received two nominations for the 69th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, becoming the first Italian TV series to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award.
Jude Law is sensational in the role of Pope Pius X111 an ambitious yet reclusive Pope shunning public appearances yet controlling and manipulative at the same time. Its one of Jude Law's finest performances if not his finest.
Imagine the most unlikely choice of Pope young , radicle with the most conservative and right ring approach the Roman Catholic Church has experienced in a Century. It reminded me a little of the Trump scenario and it's affect on American Politics, who could have imagined 5 years ago that a man like Donald Trump could reach the highest office in the United States of America?
The Young Pope is a drama television series created and directed by Paolo Sorrentino for Sky Atlantic, HBO, and Canal+. It's a sumptuous lavishly produced series financed by Sky, Canal+ and HBO, which contributed 40 million euros, with part of the money coming from the European Regional Development Fund. Production took three years between 2014 and 2016.
The first episode sets the tone for the Vatican politics of power and control when",/review/rw3732058/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2016,isungazer,10," Genius
","I am utterly in love with this series. From the gorgeous soundtrack, to the depth and humour of the dialogues, the sharp exposure of human nature and the intricacies of belief and devotion, this series in an absolute joy. This comment is from someone whose last favorite series was BBC's Merlin. I rarely watch TV and follow series; it really has to be something special to grab my attention and keep it for a long time. This is truly special. I am devouring it, fully embodying the sinner in me. I confess to the deadly sins of gluttony - because I am never satisfied and I always want more of it - and lust, because Jude Law is oh my God so sexy and hot, in body, mind, and soul, and a brilliant, brilliant actor; I was happy to know he also produces it. And why not sloth too, since I don't mind spending several hours in a row watching it and I don't feel a slight bit of guilt because of it. Oops, here goes for pride. I am totally free of greed though, for I wish everyone watch this and drink of this divine juice. Amazing, and I hope there will be no more seasons, otherwise it will lose its substance and depth. Good things come in small packets. Thank you for this gem and congratulations for the genius collaboration behind it.",/review/rw3732058/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2017,mukava991,," uninvolving oddity
","When he isn't dispensing cynical and often profane comments or cruelly taunting and teasing underlings, he alternates cigarette smoking with workouts on high-tech gym equipment. He is cold, remote, manipulative and downright repellent. In fact he has no redeeming qualities. Even his sketchy back story as an unwanted boy left in a Catholic orphanage by hippie parents fails to elicit enough sympathy to sustain interest in his trajectory through ten episodes. Such is the title character, played by Jude Law, of this undramatic and unsatisfying series, straining for irony at every turn, about the inexplicable election to Pope of a 40-ish American upstart with a murky past.",/review/rw3732058/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2017,classicalsteve,7," Surreal and Yet Somewhat Confusing Fictional Pope
","For some reason, when I began watching the first episode of this series, I thought this was an historical account of a pope who happened to begin his tenure when he was ""relatively"" young, which in Roman Catholic Pope terms, that's probably under 50. For those of you who may be tentatively interested in this series, ""The Young Pope"" is not an historical account of a pope. This is an entirely fictional narrative about a young North American pope who during the first episode desires to break with the religious traditions which have been keeping the Vatican stuck in a proverbial time machine for more or less 1500 years. Yes, the Vatican has electricity, its own television channel and even its own website which it updates periodically. However, the inner workings of the Vatican have essentially functioned as if it's still in the early Middle Ages. Princes and dukes don't arrive asking for land grants and bishoprics as they did in the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, but ceremonially, it's still the Roman Catholic Church as it for well over 1000 years.",/review/rw3732058/?ref_=tt_urv

","As i was watching the first episode i was thinking of myself "" what am i watching exactly? Is it a comedy ( black humour) , is it a drama? Is it a good one? Is it a bad one? One thing was for sure it's very interesting! Definitely one of the best series. Don't stop from the first episode, watch all of them!

8 May 2018,javicarpillixiona,10," Paolo Sorrentino is a genius!
","'The Great Beauty' and 'Youth' already proof Sorrentino's potential and natural-born talent for directing, but, once again, he's surprised us with a wonderful series, following the story of such a complex character (Lenny Belardo) masterly portrayed by the wonderful Jude Law. I'd say this is his best work ever! Diane Keaton is also amazing, as always. The cinematography is delightful and the music suits perfectly this work of art. Each and every episode touches your soul. I can't believe 'The Young Pope' didn't get more Golden Globe and Emmy nominations. This is one of the best shows in history, by far. I can't wait for 'The New Pope'!",/review/rw3732058/?ref_=tt_urv

","There are lots of series and movies about popes, the Holy See and the Catholic Church. Many are good. There can be more critical and caustic or sympathetic to the Church, but they always captivate an audience attracted by the seductive theme, in which morality is associated with tradition, brightness and pomp, and the expectation of something scandalous.",/review/rw3732058/?ref_=tt_urv

",Unconventional look at the Vatican.It is Superbly filmed and has smart dialogues with powerful acting by Jude Law who is Oscar Emmy material rolled into one. Subject is treated with complexity and asks from viewer close attention but avoids getting boring and manages to maintain a strange atmosphere throughout. Although there are a few mistakes here and there like trying to make a statement with the pope and his mother smoking cigarettes in scenes where simply the situation did not ask for it and really seemed awkward and forced the overall impression after watching the first two episodes is highly positive.I was losing hope I will ever get the chance to watch something worth watching but here it is!,/review/rw3732058/?ref_=tt_urv

30 April 2019,Hallelujah289,," Highly original but too severe
","By the sixth episode I was ready to quit ""The Young Pope."" Not for lack of interest in the show's highly original premise (a pope who doesn't believe in God!) or pleasure in its unusual treatment (weirdly amusing juxtapositions like the pope and his thug glasses and cigarettes, sunbathing). I was ready to quit because it became emotionally exhausting to keep watching a harsh and impassive main character for six hours (each episode is about an hour long). While a young and ""diabolical"" pope is a unique twist on the compassionate and adulating pope we have today, there is a limit to how much withholding is really a pleasure to experience.",/review/rw3732058/?ref_=tt_urv

","I liked this series from the first minutes. Jude Law is fascinating as Lenny, the first North American Pope, who is strange, charismatic, and arrogant. This is the Pope as a disruptor, and while such stories are often told in terms of opening the church (i.e. Going My Way), this follows the 21st century twist of disruption from the right; the hip, edgy, homophobic, harsh pope.
