",Jeff Bridges and Chris Pine put on an acting clinic.,/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2016,Red_Identity,," Excellently-written and acted
","This is definitely the type of simple film that many might dismiss when first hearing about it or seeing the promotional footage of it. What's really surprising about it is the amount of emotional and dramatic weight that it carries. It's not primarily interested in gun fights or car chases. Instead, it's interested in exploring the dynamics of race and culture, and in depicting everyone as flawed individuals who you still feel empathy for. It gives you a portrayal of what poverty and the economy can do, even when never attempting to justify the horrible behavior on display or trying to make excuses for its characters. It's filled with wonderful, thoughtful dialogue while also playing out like a realistic morality tale. The three leads are also fantastic, especially Ben Foster, who deserves to get more roles as the talented character-actor he is. This is highly recommended.",/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2018,Her-Excellency,9," A Tale of Cops N' Robbers at its Finest
","The first time I watched this, I turned it off at about the 5-minute mark. I thought it was another dumb movie about inept country-bumpkins, which would rely on a mixture of slapstick and overly-done sappy and violent scenes in order to create enough of a pull to keep at least some audience members somewhat entertained.",/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2017,bob-the-movie-man,8," ""Sometimes a blind pig finds a truffle""
","Bank robberies have been featured in many hundreds of films since the early days of cinema: The Great Train Robbery for example dates back to 1903! More recent heist classics such as ""Oceans 11"", ""Die Hard"", ""Run Lola Run"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" tend towards the stylised end of the act. Where this film delivers interest is in aligning the protagonists' drivers with the banking and mortgage 'crimes' featured in last year's ""The Big Short"". Add in to the movie Nutribullet a soup√ßon of the West Texan setting from Arthur Penn's 1967 ""Bonnie and Clyde"", turn it on and you have ""Hell or High Water"".",/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2017,TheLittleSongbird,10," Extremely high in quality, nothing hellish at all about it
","One of the most critically acclaimed films of 2016 and nominated for four Oscars, 'Hell or High Water' also had an intriguing idea, a talented cast with Jeff Bridges being a particular attraction and a script by ace writer Taylor Sheridan (writer for the brilliant 'Sicario', and went on to direct one of the most promising directorial debuts of 2017 with the recent 'Wind River').",/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2016,namashi_1,9," A Terrific Movie!
","David Mackenzie's 'Hell or High Water' is A Terrific Movie, that turns out to be an unexpected delight of the Summer. With underwhelming superhero movies or reboots doing the rounds, this Heist/Crime Motion-Picture offers a Solid Story, that is Sharply Written, Expertly Directed & Very Strongly Acted.

15 August 2016,subxerogravity,9," Nothing like a real great modern day western movie!
","Look at Chris Pine trying to prove he's not just a pretty face doing these small films that show his range, and show how he can do accents, but seriously, Pine was totally in his element here.",/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2016,Movie_Muse_Reviews,9," A morally complex ""cops-and-robbers"" film
","In a year when the quality of life in middle America small towns has come back into focus, ""Hell or High Water"" feels like an important film, perhaps more important than it might have been had it been released prior to 2016. But it's not just timeliness that makes this a good movie. There are strong performances and strong writing Taylor Sheridan, someone we should definitely be paying more attention.",/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2016,Rendanlovell,8," A film worth seeking out.
","'Hell or High Water' is a bit of an odd duck. Mainly because it got a wide release. This is the only great film that has released in 2016 that got a wide release. I mean, there are only four or five films that I thought have been really great and all of them have either got basically no theater release or a limited viewing. I truly hope that this spurs more films like it though. More well crafted movies that actually have characters you can get invested in. There have been so many films this year that have completely failed due to poor character writing. Now, this film isn't perfect. So lets just get the negatives out of the way before we get into what makes this great.",/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2016,classicsoncall,9," ""You boys robbin' the bank?""
","The comparisons to 2007's ""No Country For Old Men"" are probably inevitable. Both films feature aging Texas lawmen near the end of their careers, who contemplate the passing of a more rational era in which they came up through the ranks. There's also the principal villains, but whereas Anton Chigurh was a Terminator-like, unrelenting and vicious assassin, his counterpart here, Tanner Howard is just plain old Texas locoweed crazy. You have to credit Ben Foster in the role of older brother Tanner to Chris Pine's Toby, his characterization is just off the wall insane.",/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2016,paul-allaer,10," Flawless bank robbers vs Texas Rangers action-drama and characters study
","""Hell or High Water"" (2016 release; 105 min.) brings the story of two brothers, Toby and Tanner. As the movie opens, we see them rob two Texas Midlands Bank branches in rapid succession. It's only later that we learn why. After the second heist, the Texas Rangers are informed, and Marcus, who is going to retire in three weeks, wants to do one final case before going off into the sunset. At this point, we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2016,rick-j-walsh,10," Refreshingly original, brilliantly acted, thoughtful western/crime film
","In a summer (or should that be year or decade) of vapid sequels, remakes, and overblown superhero catastrophes, who would have expected an entertaining, intelligent, well-crafted, suspenseful, character- driven, modern-day western with a brain. Riding on Taylor Sheridan's razor-sharp script and David Mackenzie's nuanced direction, Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, and (especially) Ben Foster (along with everyone else who appears on the screen) inhabit this film as wryly humorous, heartfelt, vicious, painfully tragic, and realistic members of a society reaping the fruits it has tragically sown. Best film so far this year.",/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2016,ehost7,9," Gritty and Engaging - Great Addition to the Crime Drama Genre!
","With Taylor Sheridan as the writer and David MacKenzie at the helm, I had high hopes for this movie. Both of their last respective projects (Sheridan - Sicario, MacKenzie - Starred Up) were gritty, violent, and engaging. All of those hold true for Hell or High Water.",/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2016,dcarsonhagy,10," Definitely a ""10""

21 June 2016,wcoleparks,10," So entertaining!
","The American western seems to be slowly making a comeback in recent years. With films such as The Rover, Slow West and True Grit there have been some interesting and unique approaches to this old genre. Hell or High Water fits right in with these mentioned films by containing a lot of comedy, engaging characters, and no holds barred violence. ",/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv

",If Hell On High Water does nothing else you will throw stones or whatever else is handy at the television the next time you see Tom Selleck or Henry Winkler or any of those other folksy actors from back in the day hawk the virtues of the reverse mortgage. It should be called the reverts mortgage because it reverts to your heirs upon your demise. I can certainly sympathize with the Howard brothers here. When my mother passed away and left my brother and I with the bought and paid for completely debt free family home we both salvaged a considerable estate. ,/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2016,cosmo_tiger,10," There are movies that are so good there are not enough words to describe how good they are. This is one of them.
","""The things we do for our kids."" Toby Howard (Pine) has just lost his mother and is about to lose his family's ranch. Left with no way to raise the money he needs, he teams with his brother Tanner (Foster) and together they decide to rob banks. Things are going according to plan until sheriff Marcus Hamilton (Bridges) gets involved. Now, the two must not only get the money they need in a few days, but find a way to avoid the law as well. There are movies that are great. There are movies that are so good that you need to tell everyone you know to watch. Then there are movies that are so good there are not enough words to describe how good they are. This is one of them. The movie is not only one of the best movies of the year, but it is also one of the best of the last several. The acting is amazing, the drama is intense, but the best part of the movie is that you can understand both sides of the situation and you really aren't sure who to pull for. That to me is the sign of a great movie. It is a shame that movies like this aren't as widely seen as large budget popcorn movies. Overall, a definite must see. One of the best movies of the last few years. I loved this one. I give this an A+.",/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. A good guy doing bad things for a good reason. A bad guy doing bad things for a good reason. A good guy whose make-up doesn't allow for bad things by anyone for any reason. Director David MacKenzie (Starred Up) and writer Taylor Sheridan (Sicario) serve up a quasi-western featuring a crusty old Texas Ranger doggedly pursuing two bank robbing brothers. If not for the numerous destroy-the-flow screaming political statements, this could have been a near instant classic ‚Äì just a tick below No Country for Old Men.",/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2016,CinemaClown,," A Gritty, Rugged & Violent Western That's Destined To Garner A Cult Following.
","Blending the good, old-fashioned ruggedness of westerns with the cold-hearted brutality of crime thrillers, Hell or High Water is an intelligently scripted & smartly directed tale of family, sacrifice & personal duty that is further uplifted by its set of badass characters & solid performances from its cast, and is impressive enough to rank amongst the finest films of the year.",/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2017,bob the moo,," Despite some plotting conveniences, it is tense, honest, desperate, atmospheric, and benefits from strong performances
","With all the 'film of the year' mentions and other such praise, I was not sure what to expect from this film; I am sort of accustomed to finding such films are ""worthy"" but not much good. In this case though I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a solid and straightforward thriller, that puts a lot of stead on character, atmosphere, and creating a convincing and engaging world.",/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2016,Fella_shibby,9," Good film with superb acting, awesome screenplay n excellent cinematography.
","Saw this on a rented DVD. Its a western crime drama. Director David Mackenzie (Starred up) did a terrific job. It is a very atmospheric, character driven film n not at all boring. Taylor Sheridan (Sicario) did a fantastic job with the screenplay. He managed to create good tension in a simple robbery film. The acting by the 3 lead is top notch. Jeff bridges, Ben Foster n Chris Pines got into the characters. Its a solidly crafted, well-acted western heist thriller. The film stuns with its cinematography. The sunburnt desolate Texas backdrop creates a very nice visual palette. The colours look great. The lime green Mustang really stands out as a result. The long landscapes shots were awesome. Some may compare it to No country for old men n A place beyond the pines. Check out the scene of the rattlesnake waitress.",/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv

","In West Texas, two brothers go on a bank-robbing rampage. They are targeting the branches of one bank in particular, The Texas Midland Bank. This bank is about to foreclose on the mortgage on their ranch and claim the property, and robbing the bank to pay its own loan seems appropriate. On the trail of the brothers is a Texas Ranger, Marcus Hamilton, with only a few weeks to retirement.",/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2016,gg04804,10," Best Film This Year
","You need to see this movie. That could be this entire review, but I think I should describe how amazing this film is. Unlike most summer movies, the writing is fantastic, keeping me and the rest of the people watching with me attached to the movie and its characters even when they are just talking in a diner or something. Also unlike most other summer movies, the movie does not attempt to create artificial tension in the form of fast cuts or stupid action scenes, it creates tension in the form of dialogue and sometimes in the form of brilliantly filmed action. It should be noted that the cinematography in this film is truly amazing. The cinematography captures the desolateness and sadness of the area of West Texas that the movie is set in. There are also many wide shots, which looked like they were filmed with drones which also added to the beauty of the filming. The music also adds to the western feel of this movie. The writing of this film is where it really shines. The writing is captivating and it is so natural, for the area. The banter between both pairs of characters (the brothers and the rangers) is very entertaining in that you can almost feel their relationship and the history of it. Also, I have to say, the writing for the side characters, who are only in the film for their respective scenes is even better. This is the first time I have ever cared about some random waitress who is only in the film for 90 seconds because their writing is masterful. Also, the acting is definitely some of the best I have seen, Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges both really shine in the film because of their stunning acting. The acting helps in that when Chris Pine and Ben Foster are mid- heist you can really feel the stress when they get into situations that one or both of them are not comfortable with. In closing, this film has amazing writing, cinematography, acting, pacing, everything. This film is just beautiful and you really need to see it, like yesterday, it is easily the best film this year and a major contender for Best Picture, Best Director, etc.",/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2016,Screen_Blitz,10," Hell or High Water is a slowburner, but it certainly is a fascinating one
","This modern western heist thriller isn't the film that tap into many's expectations, at least by those who go in anticipating a series of violent, adrenaline-fueled shootout sequences (though there are some). It is a film that sets the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis into it's story's backdrop in order to generate a smart, if slightly sluggish testament of men trying to survive the brutal aftermath of the economic collapse; while competing with their morally grey persona. Most of this is greatly accomplished by director David Mackenzie who serves a strong arm for this modern western flick. Teaming up with Mackenzie is writer Taylor Sheridan who wrote the fascinating screenplay for last year's thriller 'Sicario' and sums up for the almost equally intriguing script for this one. Set in 2008 at the dawn of the global financial crises, this film stars Chris Pine as Toby, a recently divorced father stuck living in an economically depressed Texan town who has not way for providing for his family's ranch other than committing a series of bank robberies with his ruthless brother Tanner (played by Ben Foster). Their heinous crime spark the attention of Sheriff Marcus Hamilton (played by Jeff Bridges) and his partner Alberto Parker (played by Gil Birmingham) who sprawl across the state of Texas to hunt them down.",/review/rw3585063/?ref_=tt_urv
