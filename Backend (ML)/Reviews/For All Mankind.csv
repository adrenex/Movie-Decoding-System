10 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,10," One of the funniest shows ever!
","What We Do in the Shadows is not only one of the funniest shows on tv right now but it has become one of my favorite comedies of all-time. It reminds me a little of Seinfeld in which every character on the show is as equally as funny as the others. It's hard to pick out the best and everyone has their own favorite. It's based on the film of the same name and is created by the same people, Taika Waititi and Jermaine Clement. As funny as the movie was the show might be even better. It's one of the rare shows where every single episode is hilarious! There's nothing more I can really say except to go watch this show, I promise you'll love it!",/review/rw4953441/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2020,Supermanfan-13,10," Hilarious!
","What We Do In the Shadows is one of the best new comedies to come out in years, it's actually one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen! I absolutely loved the movie so I thought this was going to be a letdown but boy was I wrong...EVERY episode is great!",/review/rw4953441/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2022,Hitchcoc,9," Excellent Start
","I was told to watch this by my son. It was worth it. The three vampires are hilarious. They are balancing being everyday citizens with being folks who suck blood and kill. Guillarmo is the guy who keeps everything moving along. He is called a familiar. He opens caskets. Rounds up virgins. And hopes someday to be a vampire. The first episode involve a visit from an ancient vampire, a nosferatu look-alike who pops out of a sarcophagus. He is apparently quite a stud but the others can't wait for him to be gone. One hilarious bit takes place in a stationary store where they are buying glitter and crepe paper (creepy paper?). Guillarmo has a rough time getting them to be accepted as normal customers.",/review/rw4953441/?ref_=tt_urv

","For any who haven't seen the movie of the same title, it's highly recommended.",/review/rw4953441/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2022,pontram,," The Munsters of the 21st Century
","This is an absolute beloved show of mine, and I love the mockumentary style, since the wonderful and political incorrect 'Death Valley', which had to disappear for no reason.",/review/rw4953441/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2019,morrisonliz,10," I'm dying!
",This show is hysterical. Reminds me of the British 'The Office' without the uncomfortableness. Some people said the jokes don't land but that's the point. It's supposed to be awkward. So glad I found this. Not many shows interest me.,/review/rw4953441/?ref_=tt_urv

23 August 2022,UniqueParticle,10," Way better than I could've imagined
","This is so good I'm blown away by how enjoyable What We Do in the Shadows is! Well deserving of the 8.6 rating on IMDB, I'd agree with any great reviews. I love most the scenes and the main song You're dead is so damn good. Been skeptical of the series for awhile cause the humor but it's perfect, I'll definitely enjoy binging to catch up. I've absolutely fallen in love with this series easily one of the best out there!",/review/rw4953441/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2022,degrees-43497,10," On the best shows on TV today... Hysterical :)
","We never miss an episode. Since the movie by Waititi and Clement, we have been absolute fans of the whole idea of a house of vampires just trying to ""get by"" in the modern world. A hysterical concept excellently produced. All the actors embrace their roles to the hilt, and the comedy material is profound and abundant. The show just gets sillier and sillier... in the best way. Despite the concept - a house in the middle of the suburbs full of vampires who are kind of ""nice guys"" - they somehow make it tangible and even sympathetic. With all the vast number of ""dark & evil"" vampire tales out there, this show perfectly counterbalances the genre with some much needed silliness, presented in a thoroughly enjoyable romp every episode. Highly recommended, and I equally recommend you see the original movie for the greatest context.",/review/rw4953441/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2020,jimel98,10," Energy Vampires are REAL!
","My review (#224) will get lost in the shuffle, but I had to add something. I didn't read ALL the reviews, I eventually will have to go to bed, but the ones I did, I agree with, absolutely. This show IS brilliant, funny, dark, twisted and all that other devilishly wonderful stuff. The one thing I feel the need to add is a reference to Colin Robinson, played brilliantly by Mark Proksch. Ok, he's not one of the leads, but he's very, very funny in his own right. None of us will EVER know a real vampire (though sure, there are nut jobs who think they ARE real vampires) but we've all met Energy Vampires, THESE FOLKS ARE REAL! And it's great to see Colin interact with the regular vampires and the way they grudgingly accept him as one of their own, in some ways. I just hate the idea that this character and this actor are overlooked because, he's a very funny take on a very real issue. I'm glad he's been getting more screen time this season. Thanks cast, crew, producers for this fantastic show.",/review/rw4953441/?ref_=tt_urv

27 July 2022,celt007,10," Funniest Show On TV
",Funniest show on tv . Hilarious . The cast is superb and the jokes are non stop . Every season is better than the previous so at number 4 now and it's a true masterpiece of tv comedy . Not telling anyone what's it's about just watch and laugh .,/review/rw4953441/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,NormalGuyReviews,9," A Workplace Comedy (but with vampires)
","I know it may sound strange to call this a workplace comedy but if a vampires job is to hunt and overall be a vampire then it fits. The show has that Office, Parks and Rec type vibe but add Vampires and yes it works and I love it. The show is funny and feels refreshingly original. I recommend this show to anyone who enjoys workplace comedies, vampires, or just wants to laugh. (Also it has a dope soundtrack)",/review/rw4953441/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2022,thesar-2,9," What I'd Do to Guillermo
","Really kinda sad here...Just wrapped up Season 3 of What We Do In The Shadows and now have to wait for Season 4 - but at least it was renewed! This show is INCREDIBLE. Wonderfully written, hilarious, original (except for The Office/Parks & Rec filming style, of course) with a great cast, snappy and quick dialogue and a standout that improved episode by episode: Harvey Guill√©n's Guillermo de la Cruz.",/review/rw4953441/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2019,llhorton,9," As Good As the Movie... And That's Saying A Lot
","The original movie was hysterical from beginning to end and the same folks who wrote and starred in that one, wrote and directed this series. The entire situation is unique and different from anything else on TV, which helps to make it special. Don't miss it!",/review/rw4953441/?ref_=tt_urv

13 June 2022,daveyc-54705,9," The Office+The Real World+Vampires=What We Do In The Shadows
","This show is an absolute blast. But I also acknowledge that it's for fans of a certain kind of comedy. If the randomness of The Office isn't your cup of tea, I doubt this will be either. And that's ok.",/review/rw4953441/?ref_=tt_urv

3 July 2019,Cedric_Catsuits,10," Genius
","The 2014 film which precedes this is comedy gold and I was initially sceptical that this might be watered-down for a more mainstream TV audience. The location is different and there are new characters, but on the whole it lives up to the high standards set by the movie. The casting is spot-on and the acting flawless. The writing is inspired - this could be any family in any street in any town.",/review/rw4953441/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2022,CoopertheBeagle,9," A sublime comedy, consistently inventive
","If you enjoyed the movie, or even if you haven't seen it, you're in for a real treat with the comedy adaptation about vampires in Staten Island. The larger cast, including the core couple Lazlo and Nadja, makes for a lot of scenarios that succeed in going beyond the premises of the film. Somehow after 3-4 seasons they still come up with some of the most inventive concepts which leave the audience pleasantly shocked. Brings together a lot of the character based humor one sees in UK comedies but with the New Zealand quirkiness you see in any of the film's producer's other work. There are also a lot of moments where you realize the characters care about each other, as well as inside jokes that come back over the time, rewarding the audience for paying attention. You will laugh and be amazed.",/review/rw4953441/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2019,Foutainoflife,8," Fun Watch Especially If You Loved The Film
","I just binged watched all of this first season and I loved it. I was a bit disappointed that the original trio only made a brief appearance alongside some other ""movie"" vampires but the new cast quickly grew on me.",/review/rw4953441/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2019,brand-444,10," Please i need this to continue.
","I LOVED THE MOVIE, and the pilot just gave me the same feeling inside; creeped out, happy, sad, just please. I need at least 40 seasons with 45 min episodes. Thank you",/review/rw4953441/?ref_=tt_urv
