10 January 2023,stephekel,8," Hit home
","While this may be another ""hallmark movie"" this is on a different scale of a 'mystery'. This really hits home for anyone out there who is adopted or has any questions about their heritage. I felt this on a couple different levels. Very good acting for all involved and well written script. As someone (me) who isn't sure of familial history, this made me think of how things could have been different, had I only known. Can't wait for the next episodes as they kinda left us with a cliffhanger with the main actor on this one. This is for sure the best new series on Hallmark by far. And I have seen them all.",/review/rw8845046/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2023,Jackbv123,7," New movie series?
","Given the HMM network and the telltale signs, I assume this is the opening entry of a new Signature Mystery Series. I'm not sure and I'll have to see, but I like the premise much better than half of the amateur murder detective ones that just keep spawning on that network. Sophie is a legit PI focusing on reuniting families with lost relatives.",/review/rw8845046/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2023,cgvsluis,5," New mystery series on hallmark with potential?
","Ok the two leads did have chemistry...and I really love Niall Matter...and the concept of hunting down genealogical mysteries is fun (I would love that job!), but I felt like they didn't use as much ""genealogy"" as I would have liked.",/review/rw8845046/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2023,VetteRanger,7," I actually expected more
","We're Niall Matter fans from back in his days on Eureka, and so we tend to give his vehicles a real chance. While we found this movie good enough to keep our attention, I did expect much more from it.",/review/rw8845046/?ref_=tt_urv
