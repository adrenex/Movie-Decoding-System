26 December 2015,Sleepin_Dragon,10," Exceeded my expectations.
","Reading back several reviews I had posted back in 1998 that I wished for a remake of And then there were none. Considering it's the world's biggest selling mystery it's taken a while for a new adaptation. Well done BBC with 2015's new interpretation, talk about hitting the mark, having not long read the book it's almost as I'd picture it. Fantastic casting, particularly impressed with Charles Dance and Aidan Turner, both have such a commanding personality. The scenery is utterly breathtaking, again the island and house are exactly as I picture them, the interior of the house was jaw dropping, you really believed it to be owned by a Hollywood star.",/review/rw5426494/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2018,Coventry,8," The granddaddy-whodunit, still compelling after nearly 80 years.
","I read Agatha Christie's source novel several times and lost count of how many different versions of the story I watched on film as well as on stage, but one thing is for certain: I will never grow tired of ""And then there were None"". The very first film-adaptation, released in 1945 already, still stands proud as the best version (and my personal favorite), but this mini-series is the completest version and perhaps also the most accessible one, suitable to introduce the genius of Mrs. Christie to younger audiences! ""And then there were None"" was produced by the BBC to celebrate the 125th anniversary of Agatha Christie's birth. My sincerest respect to the makers, because they truly took the time and effort to achieve a qualitative and detailed enactment of the story with top-notch casting choices, stunningly accurate filming locations, precise decors, continuous underlying tension an ominous atmosphere throughout.

16 July 2016,Jimmy-128,8," The best adaptation so far, and a strong movie in its own right
","And Then There Were None is one of my favorite novels of any genre, and was one of the first ""grown-up"" books I read as a kid. There have been many adaptations of it for the screen, from the solid but unspectacular 1945 black and white to the occasionally too- faithful Russian version to the absolutely dreadful 80s African safari. This, in my opinion, outshines all of them, remaining more or less faithful to the story and taking elements from the previous versions and using them to far better overall effect.",/review/rw5426494/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2016,l_rawjalaurence,8," Adept Transformation of a Whodunit into a Gothic Thriller
","Others have remarked on the way in which Sarah Phelps's screenplay transforms Agatha Christie's best-selling novel - which has endured a long life as a play, as well as being repeatedly remade for the screen - into a three-hour epic full of thunder and lightning, both meteorological as well as psychological.",/review/rw5426494/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2016,TheLittleSongbird,9," Among the best of all the adaptations of Agatha Christie's masterpiece
","And Then Were None is one of my favourite Agatha Christie books, as well as one of my favourites of all time. The plot is simply ingenious, as well as a contender for Christie's darkest, as is the final solution (left me completely floored on first reading, though it is very difficult to pull off adaptation-wise), there is a suspenseful and ominous atmosphere evoked and the characters are interesting.",/review/rw5426494/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2015,quincytheodore,8," None delivers mysterious charm of secluded souls like Agatha Christie
","For a series based on famous literature work, there is a persistent effort on BBC to create proper feel for characters and isolated vista from the novel pages. The series looks strikingly posh, beautifully made with crisp cinematography while the actors play as palpable deceptive characters. This is back to the core of mystery thriller inspired by work of masterful writer and it's certainly deliciously inviting.",/review/rw5426494/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2016,mskwarczynski,6," A Plea for Screenwriters to Consider the Source
","Six minutes in and I was awed by the beauty of the film. I was ready to own it. But over the next two hours I saw my hopes of a new classic crash on the shores of Soldier Island. I found myself facing the USUAL issues whenever a favorite book is turned into a movie. The scenes were beautiful, the sets gorgeous, the acting rather good, but the screen writer felt she needed to ""improve"" the already impeccable writing of Agatha Christie with ridiculous new takes on the characters and their pasts. Instead of a sleek study of the motivations of murderers who somehow escaped the law, the ""new"" story not only changed the crimes of the guests of Soldier Island, it also changed, and in some cases, completely discarded their modus operandi. Even with the changes, I was willing to give the movie eight stars, and then I started the second half. That's when the screenwriter added a cocaine party, a budding romance, and a knife-wielding bear-skin rug. At least the ending was on point (different from the book, but with the same feel and story-line) and frankly that's the only reason I'm giving this movie six stars. A quick note to all the screenwriters out there: You do not need to strengthen GOOD writing. Leave the bones of the story alone and you will have multitudes of adoring fans who appreciate the fact that you have honored the source material.",/review/rw5426494/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2015,Tweekums,10," A gripping adaptation of this Agatha Christie classic
","This three part drama is set on a remote island off the coast of Devon in the 1939. Ten people have been lured there by Mr U. N. Owen and his wife; two as staff, eight as dinner guests. Things are strange from the start as there is no sign of the hosts they only get weirder at dinner when a record is played; a voice accuses each of the ten of causing the death of others; either deliberately or due to their actions. All but one deny the crimes they are accused of. Inevitably tempers flare but anger turns to fear when one of them chokes and dies. Things get even more stressful in the morning when a second death occurs; two things are quickly noted the deaths seem to fit in with those in the poem 'Ten Little Soldier Boys', a copy of which is in every room, and two of the ten soldier figures have disappeared from the table. As time passes more characters die in ways mirroring the rhyme and the survivors start to think that the killer must be one of the group. We also see a series of flashbacks that show us the truth about the crimes they had been accused of all of them are guilty; the only questions are will anybody survive and which of the ten is the killer?",/review/rw5426494/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2016,ButtonFilms37,10," Wonderfully Entertaining!
","An absolutely fantastic adaptation of one of Agatha Christie's masterpieces. There have been countless film and stage versions produced over the years, but now we finally have something closer to the tone of the original novel. Yes, they've updated it with a few changes (some work, some don't) but overall this is an extremely entertaining miniseries that understands what made the book work so well in the first place.

9 August 2018,jamesraeburn2003,," Flawed, but contains enough strong points to ensure that fans of Christie cannot afford to avoid checking it out.
","Ten strangers are lured to a lonely mansion on an island off the Devon coast. They have nothing in common except that each of them harbours a guilty secret and they have all been invited by a mysterious host, U.N Owen, whom none of them has met. After dinner a gramophone recording bursts into live accusing each of them of a past crime. Initially, they treat it as a sick practical joke in the poorest of taste. But, then the killer strikes and they realise that the mysterious U.N Owen is a psychopath delivering retribution for their past crimes and, even more frightening, is the reality that their murderer is one of them. One by one the guests are killed in ways parallel to the old 'Ten Little Soldier Boys' nursery rhyme, but will any of them survive?",/review/rw5426494/?ref_=tt_urv

9 May 2017,sjonathan-39233,9," Marvelous...Just marvelous...
","I'm a big fan of Agatha Christie, and I would say this adaptation did not disappoint me at all. The cast are strong, the plots are entwined yet intriguing, and the settings are on point! The only thing I could possibly argue about are those solider figurines. They are quite postmodern and different from what I expected haha! Anyway, I highly recommend this miniseries to everyone! If you're not sure whether or not to give it a try, I'll say it only takes 3 hrs to go through all the episodes. Why not give it a shot?",/review/rw5426494/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2018,maryon-1,7," And then there was a falling off
","This is certainly the best 'film of the book' there has ever been - so far. The title sequence alone deserves an Oscar, with those beautiful jade figurines disintegrating and morphing into a model of the island where it all happens.",/review/rw5426494/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2019,annbaldwin-55777,10," BRILLIANT RETELLING OF CHRISTIE'S CLASSIC WHODUNIT
","This is a brilliant retelling of Agatha Christie's classic Whodunit that's keeps you guessing right to the end and provides numerous heart stopping moments and red herrings along the way. The cast are uniformly excellent and the scenery throughout is unrivalled. Aidan Turner is particularly noteworthy as Philip Lombard. Totally amoral, brutally honest yet, as ever, his superbly nuanced acting reveals an underlying hint of vulnerability. This imo, is the best of all the recent Christie adaptations, it remains true to the original yet has a wonderful 21st century feel to it.",/review/rw5426494/?ref_=tt_urv
