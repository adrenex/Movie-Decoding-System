2 March 2005,film-critic,10," You ain't never been struck by lightning. You don't know what it's like.
","I don't think I will ever understand the disappointing backlash against this film. What I witnessed was not your typical ""western"" film full of passionate love and implausible events. Instead, what I saw was beautifully captured images, powerful acting by Damon and Thomas, a story that twisted further down a darkened rabbit hole than I was expecting, and this challenging character study that gave us a brief insight to a world that will never be seen by our eyes again. This was not the romantic film that it was marketed as, this was not the adventure that it was marketed as, but instead it was the story of one character and the tribulations that effect him on his journey into the real world. It is the story of a very compassionate man that sees the honest darkness of those around him and must face the consequences of his actions. It showcases amazing acting that may be a bit disturbing for the unfamiliar eye, but to me was nothing short of brilliant. Billy Bob successfully adapted the story from the page, but it was not the film that he wanted. Miramax butchered this film in the marketing aspect, which ultimately hurt it overall. I will never understand why this did not receive the praise it should have, but will never be ashamed to bring it out for friends and family to enjoy. This film was like finding a dollar in the couch, an unexpected surprise that keeps a smile on your face the rest of the day.",/review/rw0547768/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2011,hitchcockthelegend,6," The 35% movie that maybe originally was a minor classic?
","All the Pretty Horses is directed by Billy Bob Thornton and adapted from Cormac McCarthy's novel of the name name by Ted Tally. It stars Matt Damon, Penélope Cruz, Henry Thomas & Lucas Black. Marty Stuart scores the music and Barry Markowitz photographs it. Plot finds Damon as John Grady Cole, a young cowboy who travels with his best friend, Lacey Rawlings, from Texas across the border into Mexico. It's a journey that sees acquaintances come and go, love blossom and the harshness of the world become all too real to such young eyes.",/review/rw0547768/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2002,michaelRokeefe,6," Passionate drama of life and death.
","Director Billy Bob Thornton fills the screen with awesome scenery and a hard hitting drama about two young cowboys from San Angelo, Texas meeting up with another young horseman and coming face to face with life altering situations in and out of a Mexican prison. Friendship stays strong to the bitter end. And love proves to be stronger than life itself. Matt Damon, Henry Thomas and Lucas Black are the hard luck cowpokes. Damon falls in love with Penelope Cruz and provides some steamy love scenes. There is more drama than action in this western, but you should find it very entertaining. Damon and Black are the most impressive characters in this well-made movie.",/review/rw0547768/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2006,ccthemovieman-1,10," Excellent Storytelling, Beautifully Filmed
","This is an excellent, epic western saga about two Texans who wind up in Mexico and all the trials and tribulations they go through, most of which are fascinating. I've watched this film several times and it gets better and better with each viewing. The acting, storytelling and magnificent photography all made it a treasure of a film....and a very underrated movie. It's easy to get very involved in this haunting tale.",/review/rw0547768/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2004,jonathan_ley,," Unreleased Potential
","Cormac McCarthy's novel, All The Pretty Horses, the first part of his breath-taking Border Trilogy, is one of the most perfect source materials ever written. Add to this the impressive line-up of talent (Ted Tally adapting, Thornton directing, Matt Damon, back when he was a hot property the first time around, starring) assembled for the film version and it's fair to say my expectations were raised sky high. When the film came out it was buried by the distributor. I managed to catch it in the one week it played at a single cinema in Edinburgh and I would be lying if I didn't admit that the whole experience was a crushing disappointment. It wasn't that the film makers had ballsed the whole thing up, no it was much more frustrating than that. You could tell that somewhere in that film there was a masterpiece straining to get out. Individual sequences impressed but the whole thing moved at such a frenzied pace that the main characters' journey, a true rite of passage in the novel, had become damagingly truncated. The result was underwhelming but at the same time as been annoyed at the film I could tell it wasn't the film makers' fault. It was all too apparent that this was a great film that had had it's guts, it's heart, it's very essence, chopped out of it by a greedy distributor trying to market the film as some kind of Titanic / Young Guns cross over. Guess what, this movie was never going to appeal to the teeny boppers. If only the studio could have realized that and been true to the property they acquired in the first place. My suspicions were confirmed recently when I read an article wherein Matt Damon, a fine actor despite the criticism, claimed that Billy Bob Thornton's integral cut of the movie is the best he's ever been involved in. I don't know about you but that makes me want to see it. Apparently the studio are willing to release this extended cut on DVD (all revenue streams reach the ocean eventually) but Thornton won't settle for anything less than a full cinematic re-release. I can't say I blame him, I get the impression his film deserves at least that much. So for now I can't recommend this film, check out the novel instead and then the rest of Cormac McCarthy's back catalogue. But let's hope that in the not too distant future this film finally gets the treatment I suspect it deserves.",/review/rw0547768/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2000,Doogie D,8," Might have been a masterpiece
","ALL THE PRETTY HORSES is quite effective, though there are some serious gaping holes in the story.  The story and characters insist that John Cole and Alejandra have fallen in love; we only get to see a swift montage of sex-making, which is not the same thing at all.  Damon made me believe that John was in love through the sheer force of his acting, but the audience needed to be courted along in this romance.  Also, Lacey Rawlins at one point crucially (suicidally?) antagonizes a fellow in prison, and we have no idea what bad blood has been brewing between these two.",/review/rw0547768/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2005,vernoncoffee,8," this lovely film hasn't been dumbed down to a simple formula
","What sets this lovely film apart is that it hasn't been dumbed down to a simple formula. I looked up a number of reviews for this picture and found many of them gave it mediocre ratings, complaining it wasn't a good western, adventure flick or romantic film. They are correct, it isn't; thankfully because it isn't suppose to be. These reviewers have become benumbed by Hollywood's usual coarse handling, and misunderstand the subtly of this picture, ironically their criticism is praise.",/review/rw0547768/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2001,Peach-2,6," Torn.
","I really wanted to love this film and from the opening scenes to the last third I really did like this film. I love surreal films as much as the next guy, but this film seems like it was made by Oliver Stone on Valium. The film is really slow, now that can be a good thing, but in this case the pace just keeps getting slower and slower. I heard that Thornton's original cut ran almost four hours, it seems that the film has a whole other film missing from it. I didn't read the novel and I'm guessing that I should have read the novel because I couldn't figure this film out for the life of me. When it was all over I felt empty. The performances are all great, I especially liked Lucas Black in the role of Blevins. Matt Damon and Henry Thomas are both very good in their roles and this is first movie Penelope Cruz has appeared in where I could see that she has real talent and isn't just another pretty face. I loved the cinematography, the outdoor landscapes were beautiful. The film has all the flavor and no real substance. I am torn with this film, I wanted to love it so bad. Even great film makers slip every now and then.",/review/rw0547768/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2001,TxMike,," Very fine ""coming of age"" film, but only for those who enjoy a good story over lots of action.
","I think the most accurate rating for ""All The Pretty Horses"" is ""7.5"" of 10, but I give it ""8"" since we can't do fractions on Imdb. I read some of the negative user reviews of this movie, and I must say those reviewers obviously don't know how to follow and appreciate a good story. That became more obvious when I read some of their other reviews. This is a story of two young men who knew nothing but 1940s Texas ranch life, and head out to Mexico for an adventure, to work as ""cowboys"" for a while. What they encounter is totally unpredictable, as well as how they handle their situations. Well-acted and beautifully filmed, this really is a fine movie. When appropriate, the actors pause, reflect, figure out what to do, as we would in real life. No ""rapid fire"" dialog here!",/review/rw0547768/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2003,jwillia2,10," Crafted like a fine-tooled saddle
","This is a hard film to pin down...given the spoon-fed plots we've all been conditioned to follow.  It's sold as a love story, but that's one small bend in the film's long, dusty road.  If I had to classify it in conventional terms, I'd put it somewhere between ""coming of age"" and an ""american odyssey."" It's spread out and slowly told--that's the nature of the subject. But to hell with all that.",/review/rw0547768/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2002,moonspinner55,3," Newcomers trying for old-style Hollywood feel, and failing
","From Cormac McCarthy's novel about young man in 1949 Texas leaving the family ranch for a life in Mexico, and winding up in hot water. Despite mystical undermining (which, presumably, is what director/co-producer Billy Bob Thornton brought to the table), film has a distracting 'formula' feel: two-parts western, one-part forbidden romance, and one-part prison picture. None of it gels, simply because the screenwriter (Ted Tally, of all people) and Thornton are trying for the kind of heavy, romantic movie-western style popular 40 years ago, and yet they do not possess the subtle qualities to make this genre successful for them. Matt Damon frequently flashes his shy/self-conscious movie-star smile, but he's so clean and bland and laid-back, he's practically non-existent on the screen. Penelope Cruz, as his forbidden flame, is better, but the other performers are less charismatic, and the story has no center--it just rambles around. *1/2 from ****",/review/rw0547768/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2021,boblipton,6," Penelope Cruz Is Prettier
","Westerners Matt Damon and Henry Thomas go on a wanderjahr to Mexico in the 1940s looking for the meaning to life. They get into all sorts of trouble, including Damon falling in love with Penelope Cruz, the daughter of the country's most important ranch owner. They go to prison, and the story meanders around a lot, with a lot of handsome vistas and a summing up by Bruce Dern. Lucas Black, as a wild youngster who is just as good as he says, is the most interesting character for me; I know a guy like that.",/review/rw0547768/?ref_=tt_urv

","One of the best movies I've seen in the past year.  The sweeping panoramic settings, the great writing and a subtle, great performance by Matt Damon make this a movie not to miss. I enjoyed everything about this movie, from the graphic, depressing prison scenes to the joyous romance between a young cowboy and his Mexican princess girlfriend.",/review/rw0547768/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2003,claudio_carvalho,7," A Politically Correct Movie With no Surprises
","John Grady Cole (Matt Damon) is an American drifter, who moves to Mexico expecting to have a better life, but nothing works the way he has expected. ""All the Pretty Horses"" is a kind of predictable soap opera from Billy Bob Thorton. It is indeed a politically correct melodramatic story, with average performances and direction, although having an excellent cast with names such as Matt Dammon, Sam Shepard, Robert Patrick, Lucas Black, Rubén Blades, Bruce Dern and Penélope Cruz. For fans of Billy Bob Thorton, it is a very disappointing movie, but for lovers of linear romances, it is a beautiful movie, with wonderful landscapes and a message of loyalty and principles. ""All the Pretty Horses"" is a correct movie with no surprises. My vote is seven.",/review/rw0547768/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2006,peters159-1,7," Better Late Than Never
","After seeing Matt Damon carrying ""The Rainmaker"" I sat up and became a real fan of the actor. In that movie he impressed me greatly. I decided to see what was he doing next. I read where he was slated to star in All the Pretty Hourses so I got a copy of the book to see what it was all about. I liked what I read and was looking forward to see Matt Damon in the effort. When I read where Billy Bob Thornton was to direct I became ecstatic, I remembered his acting and directing in Sling Blade. Later, I read where there was trouble with the length of All The Pretty Horses at the producer threatened to cut the movie. Mr Thornton's version ran almost 4 hours, the released version to theaters was 117 minutes. Of course I went to see the movie and could see that it should have been longer. Any movie buff could see that. What perplexes me is how studios and produces can contract certain directors and then butcher their completed work. Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time in America suffered a humiliation when the studio decided to cut his film drastically; it lost it's meaning, and money. Later, the DVD restored version, 225 minutes, came out and was instantly received by customers. Thank God David O. Selznick stuck to his guns with Gone With The Wind. And look at how much money that! made. Like some others I hope that some one one day will be able to assemble the 4 hour version of All The Pretty Horses so that those of us who love movies can at least see what we've missed. I think we deserve to judge the movie for ourselves. Who knows, we might be missing a masterpiece.",/review/rw0547768/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2001,Fever,2," All the crummy plot lines
","In an afternoon of chick flicks, this was one of our unfortunate choices. This tries to be much like ""Legends of the Fall"" with the the scenic shots, forbidden lovers, and dramatic story. Unfortunately, it doesn't get beyond the scenic shots. It's really sad when you could remove a main character from the entire movie and the ""story"" would still continue. Penelope Cruz is a slutty, boring piece of eye-candy that professes honor then sleeps with Matt Damon the second time she sees him. Then she whines that she has no honor left....hhmmmm. An what exactly was their love based on? There was no friendship, no development, nothing. Just riding in pastures then rolling in the sheets. After another hour of chases, beatings and lots of dialogue, we somehow end up back where the movie began and the credits roll. While the music is quite good and the cinematography is pretty, overall, it is a great disappointment. Maybe rent it if it's on the 49 cent rack.",/review/rw0547768/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2003,TSHunter,," Great but Too Short
","This is a Great Film, but its pacing is wrong.  I know the main reason for that is they never released the director's cut.  I know that would add a couple of extra hours on the film, but this film deserves the extra footage, and with it cut out, the film suffers from pacing mismatch.  Believe it or not, it feels way too rushed for the experience it is meant to invoke.  To anyone who can read this that can do something about it, please release the director's cut and ditch the original final cut.  The difference can be compared to that of Bladerunner or other great films after the director's cut was released that was much better than the original final cut.",/review/rw0547768/?ref_=tt_urv

","All the Pretty Horses (2000): Dir: Billy Bob Thornton / Cast: Matt Damon, Penelope Cruz, Henry Thomas, Lucas Black, Ruben Blades: Intriguing romance suggesting the many women in the world and the difficulties in obtaining trust. Matt Damon and Henry Thomas ride out to Mexico and are joined by a drunken reckless boy. They decide to help him steal back his belongings. They eventually end up taming wild horses. Damon has an affair before they land in prison. Both Damon and Thomas are met with the reality that connection to the boy was a mistake. Conversation about horses mating in different breeds regards Damon from Texas and Penelope Cruz from Mexico. One wonders why they would foolishly return to dangerous territory. Well directed by Billy Bob Thornton who previously made Sling Blade. Damon rides the fine line between love and danger but one wonders why anyone would decide to return to dangerous territory. Thomas is good but not necessary. It is as if the screenwriter couldn't find anything for him to do. Cruz is caught between love and family without much of a clear thought. Lucas Black plays a troubling drunken wretch who finds fatal consequences. Ruben Blades also brings strict reservations to the whole rule based community. Well made film with great symbolism and a theme regarding carefree risks where acting on impulse comes with a price. Score: 6 ½ / 10",/review/rw0547768/?ref_=tt_urv
