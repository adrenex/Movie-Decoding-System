19 April 2021,robfollower,8," Kate Winslet is Phenomenal
","Mare of East Town is an excellent character study. Kate Winslet is superb. She is thoroughly committed to her role. Kate is walking a Tightrope of being a character that is a bit too brash to like on the surface. But this is where her brilliance as an actress shines through. She adds a depth , both standoffish and sympathetic. Whinslet adds just a touch of wry humor and in the end it wins you over and I identify with her troubled and bruised character. I honestly can say I've never seen here in a gritty role like this before. The writing is very well done that helps the entire ensemble in this limited series. I have a strong feeling this is going to be an engaging mystery , drama HBO has come up with . I would say it's definitely worth checking out.",/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2021,TxMike,," Kate Winslet does a superb turn as Mare, a detective in this small community.
","We don't have an HBO subscription so I was able to view this limited series (7 episodes, each roughly one hour) on a set of DVDs from my public library. My wife started with me but abandoned it after just half of the first episode, she didn't like the brusque nature of Mare, but that is part of her character arc, influenced by losses she had recently suffered. I believe my wife would have enjoyed the series if she had stuck with it.",/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv

",Easttown is a close-knit community outside of Philadelphia. It's a place where tragedy and drugs have been weighting on its people. Yet they survive. Police Detective Mare Sheehan (Kate Winslet) has been under pressure to solve the case of a friend's missing daughter for the past year. Another girl ends up dead and Mare is given the case.,/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2021,Mk577360,9," Freakishly Accurate
",The fact that a Brit mastered the very isolated DelCo accent is incredibly impressive. A very small percentage of Philly suburbanites have that accent and she delivered beautifully.,/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2021,susiewtsn,9," Cailee Spaeny, take a bow!
","Of course Kate Winslet is amazing in every role she plays, and this is no exception, but I was particularly taken with Cailee Spaeny in the role of Erin. Her role could have been forgettable, since it was so short. But she was so vulnerable, so hopeful, so tragic. She should go places in the future.",/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Liked it much more than I expected!
","I can't believe how much I enjoyed Mare of Easttown. It's about a small town Pennsylvania homicide detective who's life falls apart around her as she investigates a murders. She's also a home town basketball hero so the entire town knows her. Even though it's gotten great reviews and has been nominated for just about every award I was still hesitant about watching it. I was wrong. It was fantastic! The writing and acting (especially Kate Winslet) are some of the best of the year. The twists and turns will keep you at the edge of your seat and guessing what's going to happen next. All the hype surrounding this show is much deserved. If you haven't seen it yet give it a chance, you won't be disappointed!",/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv

",I was never a Winslet fan. Could be my loathing of Titanic that turned me off.,/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2021,Weirdo-Magnet,9," Absolutely amazing.
","I literally watched all 7 episodes in 1 day. Then, after it had all ended, I didnt know what to do with my life.",/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2021,cherold,7," gritty show with excellent performances, but sometimes drags
","Mare of Easttown is a really good miniseries with a great lead performance by Kate Winslet, an uncompromising attitude towards the complexity and sometimes awfulness of even generally good people, and an engaging plot.",/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2021,dfloro,8," About Kate Winslet's mastery of accents
","If you think about an actress who has convincingly portrayed characters with distinctive accents, you probably think of Meryl Streep (Sophie's Choice, The Iron Lady, etc.). But how about Kate Winslet, who has frequently dropped her proper British accent to play, for example, a German woman during wartime (The Reader), an Australian returning home to her small town (The Dressmaker), and a Polish-American business woman (Steve Jobs). Do you know why you don't even remember her characters' accents in these movies? They were so perfect that there was no distraction or indeed reason to bring up the subject. Well, in Mare of Easttown, the regional American accent from an area of Pennsylvania is dead on! Again. And combined with her interaction with Jean Smart (who proved she could handle another regional American accent on the Designing Women '80s TV show), who believably plays her mother here, it's another masterful turn of voice & phrase for Ms. Winslet. She won an Emmy for playing the title character in a previous HBO miniseries, Mildred Pierce, so the Emmy voters better be ready to sharpen their pencils once again for her this time!",/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv

25 September 2022,cs_rahul_kumar,10," Kate Winslet Delivers A Magnificent Performance in This HBO Murder Mystery Series !!!
","Mare of Easttown begins with the murder of a troubled teen mom, setting Mare on a trail to solve the mystery and the heavy baggage that comes with it. With a cold case of a missing teen already sitting heavy on her shoulder, Mare has her plate full. But things never come easy for Mare, we begin to understand, as her gnarly past suggests. Still reeling from the trauma of losing her addict-son to suicide, Mare lives with her mother (a spectacular Jean Smart) and her young daughter Siobhan (Angourie Rice), a few yards away from her newly engaged ex-husband. And in the middle of this all is the light of her life, Drew, her grandson, for whom she is prepared to fight an ugly custody battle.",/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv

","A young woman is murdered in a small Pennsylvania town. On the case is Detective Sergeant Mare Sheehan, a highly skilled crime investigator. She has spent all of her life in Easttown and knows everybody in it. However, her life is dark and troubled, due largely to the recent death of her son.",/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2021,Just-A-Girl-14,7," Good but overrated
",It's a good show but it's way overrated. I had high expectations from what I've heard and it didn't live up to it.,/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2021,Inglouriousbell,10," Genius story telling
","Episode 5, Illusions, was unexpected in the most incredible and heartbreaking way. I was a police officer for 11 years, 3 as a detective, and the episode triggered something deep inside that evoked so much emotion. I am absolutely impressed with this show.",/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2021,lee_eisenberg,10," in small town Pennsylvania, things will come out (especially when portrayed so masterfully)
","We're not even halfway through the year, but ""Mare of Easttown"" is one of the best miniseries of the year. Kate Winslet's unglamorous appearance and adoption of a rough accent, combined with her character's personal problems as she investigates a murder, make this a show that you have to see. And boy is it an intense one! No description can do it justice. You have to see it to believe it.",/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2021,breshetar-74720,9," BRILLIANT!
","Kate Winslet is an outstanding actress and the other actors are right at her level! The storylines are intriguing and have kept me tuning in each week. BRAVO HBO! I really appreciate how Kate portrays REAL WOMEN - the good, the bad, the ugly - without apologies or compromises.",/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2021,UniqueParticle,10," Exactly what I wanted it be
","I love it already Kate Winslet is exquisite! I really like the director Craig Zobel for his films Compliance and The Hunt are great horrors. Mare of Easttown is a wonderful series available on HBO there has been much on it in months; this show reminds me of a different style of True Detective. Amazing acting, writing, cinematography, and editing would highly recommend!",/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2021,T2TLED,10," Strong start
",WOW. A great start. Feels very authentic and the cast is amazing. Lots of interesting characters. The tone of this show is spot on.,/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2022,Adarsh_Kumar_Singh,10," Super
","They never missed anything. Every single possible detail. Nothing happens without a reason. Not even a single word was wasted. Everything had a reason. In todays' world of tv(steaming) and cinema cliches, here is a story so very well told. The writing I think is pitch perfect. All the leads as well as the not so leads gave more than one hundred percent.",/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2021,Her-Excellency,3," I do NOT get the hype!
","This show is SO formulaic, and EVERY ""twist"" can be seen a mile away. NONE of the characters (well, except for Zabel) was particularly engaging nor did I feel invested in them at all.",/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2021,andrewrye-06535,4," Too many red herrings and Too many Plot Holes
","This started out ok. I enjoyed Kate Winslet's character although it was pushed a bit far. An unkempt, vape puffing middle aged detective that seemed a bit OTT after 6 episodes. I like Kate Winslet's work and she is an actor with great talent but unfortunately she outshone the other cast members a bit much and they seemed to be scrambling to keep up with her.",/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2021,ercfunk-445-950046,5," Way overrated
","The acting is done well. That's about where the buck stops. The writing is terrible. Mare is another unlikable character, the drama feels unnecessary, and the story feels very anticlimactic. It could have just been a 90 minute movie.",/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2021,samyoon,10," Phenomenal show! The best so far this year.
",Best series I have seen in awhile! Quality quality quality from top to bottom. Kate Winslet and the rest of the cast were perfect. Directing was exceptional. The stories and all the themes presented was executed masterfully. The score was probably the weakest aspect of the whole show but still solid.,/review/rw6985511/?ref_=tt_urv
