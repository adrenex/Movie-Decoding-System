28 June 2016,edwagreen,1," *1/2*
","Simply dreadful 2011 film with Owen Wilson and his pal given a hall pass by their wives. This simply means that for one week, they can act as single guys and cavort with whomever they choose to do so.",/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2018,francesco-trio,8," i really don't understand why so many bad reviews
","I really don't understand why so many bad reviews, infact i found this movie not so bad, even a nice one funny and entertaining.
of course is a light movie and nothing so special, but if you want a light comedy with several funny scenes and laughs that could be ok.",/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2013,g-bodyl,8," Criminally Underrated!
","Hall Pass is definitely a sweet and raucous film that is vastly underrated. I almost skipped this movie because of the bad things I was hearing about it. But because it has Owen Wilson starring and that talented Farrelly Brothers at the helm, I decided to give this film a shot. There are better R-rated comedies out there, but this still is a respectable one with lots of funny and dramatic moments.",/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2011,virindra,7," Hilarious closing credits.
","Now we have a quite original movie here. Funny movie and very realistic about a couple of men who are married, and their wives invent a hall pass so their men can do whatever they want for a week. For a week they are not married.",/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2013,mattkratz,7," average
","This movie was about two married guys who get a ""hall pass"" from their marriages, granted from their wives. One of them is given to him voluntarily, the other one pretty much forces it out of her. They pretty much have a week to do ""as they please"" with other women as one of the wives has had enough with his ""noticing"" other women.",/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2015,juneebuggy,7," Right movie right time for me
","This did make me laugh, one of those right movie at the right time scenarios because it really is pretty dumb. Lots of gross out raunchy humour thanks to the Farrelly brothers.",/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2011,eric262003,7," Delightful to Some Extent
","Comedies can be very unpredictable at times. It can manipulate you into a corner where they make out as if it's a great movie. Only to find out it was really dumb. Other times they'll com you into assuming it's repugnant and morally reprehensible only to find out in the end it's subliminally complex. ""Hall Pass"" falls in the latter category. The story is about as simple as screwing on a light bulb. Two middle-aged husbands (Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis) are granted ""hall passes"" from their wives (Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate) which mean they are permitted one week freedom from parenthood. The predictable hoopla comes into place including those annoying catcalls to attractive women; morally deplorable juvenile gags, disgusting jokes around the male anatomy; lots of tiresome boozing and alcoholic binges and the overdone finale where our protagonist begs for redemption and usually has to make compromises in which they gladly oblige.",/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2011,bob-rutzel-1,1," Highly Disappointing
",Rick (Wilson) and Fred (Sudeikis) are given Hall Passes by their wives for one week to do whatever they want with whoever they want. Their thinking is that this will get their husbands to appreciate them more. Is this a good idea?,/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2013,donjeffries,1," Yet Another Putrid ""Comedy""
","I must sound like a broken record, but once again this horrid film proves that Hollywood simply cannot make a decent comedy anymore. This one has the same things they all do now- tons of juvenile potty humor, gratuitous male nudity (and in a rarity, a brief topless female), and a predictable, disastrous message. The male nudity, by the way, includes a close up view of a male's penis. ",/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2013,EmDee-427-469344,1," Typical Farrelly fare.
","I can't believe these brothers are wealthy purely based on toilet humor and breasts (possessed by girls who look like models while the male leads look like old men) - yeah realistic...NOT! This movie was once again aimed at men who don't need a realistic plot. Just cheap laughs, stick material and an excuse to use next time they want to stray...",/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2011,doomsyer,8," Why all the haters?
","I don't understand all the haters on here about this movie? I thought it was funny and laughed all the way through, and so did my wife. It is a lot funnier than Little Fockers was, and that is not saying much. It is a great movie to go and watch and just sit back and laugh and forget your troubles. What is wrong with some crude humor? I guess since I am in my 40s, and have friends that talk and act like the ones in the movie, it just was funnier to me...who knows....",/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2011,StevePulaski,8," Might be passed up with hefty comedy competition in 2011
","It's been four years since The Farrelly Brothers' forgettable remake of The Heartbreak Kid had it's brief run in the theaters, now we have a much funnier film called Hall Pass about Rick (Wilson) and Fred (Sudeikis) who are given a week off from marriage from their wives Maggie (Fischer) and Grace (Applegate). The week is anticipated to be one of the best weeks of their lives, but ends up being a slow and dull weekend of failed attempts to meet women.",/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2011,jgregg42,8," Go Get Your ""Hall Pass""
","Have you ever wondered what happened to the crew of guys from the first ""American Pie"" movie? After they lost ""it"" I often wonder what happened after they got married and had kids and moved out to the suburbs. What happened 20 years later when they were no longer the ""Big Men on Campus""? ",/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2012,the___force,1," The premise is immature an annoying (left-wing nonsense)
","If these guys are so desperate for sex, and if their wives are morons who don't care who they sleep with, why not just go and find some prostitutes to sleep with? They don't even have a enough time to develop a relationship. I am so glad to see that the sense of commitment to marriage is alive and well in Hollywood. Apparently, the point of the movie is to show that people don't really want to be married. Casual sexual or childish teenage infatuation are more compelling than a committed marriage where the wife and husband have remained faithful to each other. If a husband is so immature that he goes around like a teenager dreaming about sleeping with younger women, then he should never have gotten married in the first place. He is a fool who has no clue what marriage is about.",/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2011,ChipperX,10," You WILL Laugh - Even after the Credits Roll.
","""Hall Pass"", the latest movie from the Farrelly brothers starring Owen Wilson (Rick) and Jason Sudeikis (Fred), is a raunchy comedy that serves up ""distasteful"" humor. The movie has an intended audience: People (male and female) who enjoy raunchy, racy, ""dirty"" comedy. If you laughed until you cried while watching ""There's Something About Mary"", then you will most likely appreciate this flick. If you thought ""Dumb And Dumber"" was just plain stupid, then you will probably not enjoy ""Hall Pass"".",/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2013,SnoopyStyle,6," unlikeable subject matter, but salvaged a little something
",The Farrelly brothers are once again stuck on something uncomfortable. Are they really saying that a pass to cheat is something to root for? The fact is the subject isn't that fun to watch. The whole concept is truly unlikeable but they were able to salvage a few laughs out of the whole thing.,/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2020,UniqueParticle,9," Love this silly movie
","So many of the scenes are awesome and fun to watch! I wish I could work with the Farrelly brothers, they make lovable movies plus I have autism so I appreciate a lot of the characters in they're films. I love the dirtiness throughout. So much brightness and delightful fun I appreciate cinema so much! The CSI theme is so epic too.",/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2011,PWNYCNY,," Beware of the crude props.
","In the world of movies, one of the most endearing genres is that of the goofy comedy - provided it's funny. Unfortunately, this movie does not quite measure up, although it does make an effort. The problem is the story itself. The premise is not funny. Neither are the characters. The two main characters are not funny at all. Their wives are not funny either. The directors even inject some explicit sexual material in an attempt to prop up the movie and it's embarrassing. When one considers the great comedy teams, their characters were fundamentally innocent. Their movies didn't need crude sexual props. Hence, when such props are introduced, that means the movie is in trouble and although the directors try to present an entertaining product, ultimately the final product is such that it generates a feeling of relief when it's finally over.",/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2011,phd_travel,9," One of the funnier comedies for the last few years
",The premise of a one week break from married life is the story for Hall Pass. The Brothers take a shot married life and succeed. There are many laugh out loud moments almost throughout the movie. It is really the Brothers best in a while. Put it after Something About Mary and Shallow Hal. There is a satisfying story always a moral. It's risqu√© without being crude even though there is some toilet humor. Also it's never painful to watch. Jokes are fresh and even though you can guess the outcome it's just really enjoyable to see how you get there. It's one of those comedies that is funny even if you watch it a second time because there are so many good lines.,/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2011,scrapmetal7,3," I can't believe this was from the Farrelly Brothers.
","There used to be certain elements one could count on in the Farrelly Brothers' films. Of course, everybody knows about their gross-out moments, but their films were also genuinely funny and also had a lot of heart, they were able to get a lot out of their stars, and use unusual locations to great effect. Best of all, they had a kind of daring to create a slapstick comedy environment and then take it into a meaningful direction (KINGPIN being my favorite example). Judd Apatow movies do this now, but I still expect the Farrellys to continue making the kind of comedies they pioneered. THE HEARTBREAK KID had given me a lot of hope that they still have the touch, but in the case of HALL PASS, my expectations are definitely not met.",/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv

7 April 2011,DICK STEEL,9," A Nutshell Review: Hall Pass
","Mention the Farrelly Brothers, and There's Something About Mary springs to mind almost immediately. Known for their rather raunchy brand of comedic films such as The Heartbreak Kid starring Ben Stiller, their latest film Hall Pass takes a dig at stable, married lives by introducing the titular concept of getting a mutually agreed upon break from marriage to do anything you please. Anything. And to the average Joe, this probably means to boldly go hook up with members of the opposite sex, getting drunk and wasted, and more. Or is it?",/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2011,thebitterend1981,1," Total rot.
","This thing is just awful, pointless and dull. It doesn't even have the wit to crazy combo of the Hangover. The premise is insipid, the writers have obviously got no idea of how actual, adult relationships work. Nothing more than another in a long line of mass produced, dopey, incredulous 'comedy' produced for the lowest common denominator. if this is the future of what our comedies are, no thanks. Take my advice;skip this movie. Walk past it on store shelves. If it's Telly, unplug the set and go out for a pint. It's not funny. Not even remotely. It's groan inducing. If you like other brainless rot like Napoleon Dynamite, Mama's Boy, Or anything of that 'style' , a term which I use in the loosest conceivable terms, you may get something out of this. If you've never actually been with a Woman, then the concept of this film may actually hold some sort of allure.",/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2021,lhevi,10," Why the low ratings???

17 December 2011,rsol55,1," Truly disgusting
","The authors are apparently incapable of coming up with anything generally amusing, so they instead substitute a serious of gross out, shock scenes. The piece in the main is a female revenge fantasy - the male characters are depicted as stupid and insensitive enough to ask for a license to cheat, the women with complete unrealism grant it, and in turn the women are successful and the men are spectactularly unsuccessfully. Perhaps he Farelly slobs and their friends are like that, but even if so they shouldn't tar all men that way.",/review/rw2533939/?ref_=tt_urv
