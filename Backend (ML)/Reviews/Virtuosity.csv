30 June 2019,Narce,9," Cancelled? Say it ain't so!
","I was so disappointed when I heard that this show had not been renewed. It is one of the few ""comedies"" on TV that consistently makes me laugh out loud. The cast is well-chosen and the writing is superb.",/review/rw4947154/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2018,biba_yu,10," Really funny series, great characters
","This is one of rare comedy shows I have seen lately that has made me laugh out loud many many times per each episode. It is almost perfect comedy show with ridiculous but quite lovable characters, and intelligent thou silly but quite funny situations and quality humour. Never feels forced or contrived, quite good actors (even child actors, whatdoyouknow!), love Brandt, Wiest, Sadoski, everyone in general, and Colin Hanks is pleasant surprise too (who would say talent can be inherited?).
I hope this show lasts and keeps its high quality.",/review/rw4947154/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2019,valloton,9," So Long Modern Family
","Where Modern Family excels in over-acting, towcramping scripts and far from believable charachters, this show is the opposite. It's funny, the actors are in their element .
It's how you spell a believable ""dysfunctional"" family",/review/rw4947154/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2019,nivethanin,9," One of the greatest sitcoms in the past few years!
",I absolutely cannot believe this show got cancelled. I binged it on Netflix just recently and couldn't wait for more. I just checked for the upcoming season date when I found out the show got cancelled?!? It's such a smart sitcom with a loveable cast. The writers and cast deserve better than this.,/review/rw4947154/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2015,mardee-3,10," Gets better every week
","I really enjoyed the pilot but am enjoying this show even more as it progresses. I haven't watched a ""laugh-out-loud"" sitcom for awhile until this show - last week I almost doubled over during some of the segments. The entire cast is brilliant and pulls it off every week. I never knew Colin Hanks could be that funny! And I'm so happy to see Zoe Lister-Jones (who I loved in Whitney) and Thomas Sadosky (wonderful in Newsroom). Dan Bakkedahl is absolutely brilliant as are Dianne Weist and James Brolin. Even the kids are good, and I'm usually not enamored of child actors. ",/review/rw4947154/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2015,dreamgavino,10," Laugh Out Loud Comedy
","Nothing but respect and total love for this show... the entire cast is funny (Jordan, Colin, Zoe,etc.) and the writing is awesome! I love comedy shows that actually make me laugh out loud, and I was pleasantly surprised that each episode made me laugh several times. Other shows try too hard or not enough...other shows have a great cast but bad writers...this one has everything right (much like Goldilock's third pick in the house she trespassed in)...I also appreciate the fact that each episode is broken down into four yummy bite sized servings.. this fresh format helps with the flow of the show's comedic pace... Hope this show gets more love from viewers and critics",/review/rw4947154/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2019,hosehead-4,10," Way to *not* go, CBS!
","I've watched this show since it premiered and was very disappointed, to say the least, that it was cancelled. By all means, let's make room for more NCIS and CSI spin-offs instead! Epic fail, CBS. Life in Pieces was smart, funny, well-written and well-acted. I liked the fast pace and the four-story format. I guess some people just didn't get it or the network didn't know what to do with it. Either way, a dumb move to cancel it.",/review/rw4947154/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2016,Shellbug526-686-571200,10," Incredible!
","I cannot believe all the negative reviews this show has gotten! It is well written and absolutely hilarious. The entire cast is superb, somehow James Brolin just keeps getting better with age! The show follows one family, parents their three grown children and their families. Every character on the show is interesting. Even the young kids are well written. They are wealthy and somehow it is still easy to relate to them. It is witty, sarcastic, and much funnier than most of the shows it is compared to, though I don't see why it's compared to anything, as it is very original. It is one of the few comedies my husband and I both agree on, laugh out loud funny! Give this show a chance, I don't see how you could be disappointed.",/review/rw4947154/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2020,Web_Of_Doom,10," Without this our comedy life is in pieces
","Fantastic & clever innovative comedy show that was enjoyable to watch.
If the writers need a break that is fine as we don't want bad writing but this show was strong from start to finish ( such a shame Modern Family ended so badly ).
Life in Pieces is a great show so let the writers re-energise & make some more awesome scripts & then please re-launch this show in a year or two with as many of the main cast as you can.
The cast who must return are Zoe Lister-Jones, Colin Hanks, Holly Barrett, Betsy Brandt, Giselle Eisenberg, Dan Bakkedahl & as much as they wish both the truly brilliant Dianne Wiest & James Brolin. Those 8 actors are the heart of the show & the others though would be welcome to be seen are not essential to the show.
I enjoyed all the actors of this show however those key 8 are all really what made the show tick for me at it's highest level of comedy & drama combined.
If Matt Short & Colleen were based in Germany permanently ( could visit ), plus Tyler & Clementine were off at college ( could visit too ) then that would leave more space for developing characters to have air time such as lark & new arrivals.",/review/rw4947154/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2016,SGSypult,10," Fantastic
","Wish I would have caught on from the beginning, but I will watch all episodes. This is an extremely witty and tightly written show. Very funny. The writing and acting work perfectly together. The cast is a wonderful blend of seasoned and lesser-known actors and they are all terrific. I really hope that the show's popularity has staying-power, but that may depend on the intelligence of the audience. Even the kids in the cast are wonderful. I've looked up the cast members whom I didn't know within IMDb so that I could get to know them a little better. Keep up the good work. I really appreciate what you're doing. I have been recommending to others.",/review/rw4947154/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2020,jennfinn,10," Shouldn't have been canceled
","I honestly never heard of this delightful show until I watched something about Two Broke Girls (worst show ever) and someone commented about Life in Pieces. I don't understand for the life of me why CBS canceled this show. It's everything Modern Family isn't; there's no over acting, the characters are realistic and relatable. My only complaint is I'm not used to seeing Dan Bakkedahl being the butt of jokes as he was the master of insults when he was in Veep.",/review/rw4947154/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2019,Br4ve-trave1or,9," Hidden treasure
",So happy I stumbled upon this hidden gem late in the game being I had so many episodes to binge watch. This series is hilarious and I should've known seeing Justin Adlers name attached to it----Better off Ted---im in love with this show!,/review/rw4947154/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2020,flemeagle,10," Fantastic
","What idiot cancelled this show. The funniest show I've watched. Better than modern family. Better than any current comedies and up there. The writer and actors should be very proud of what they produced in every episode. This is what is wrong with ""the powers that be"" in the television industry. They aren't in touch with the people and think they know what's best",/review/rw4947154/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2015,ccorral419,10," Good family TV viewing
","Creator Justin Adler (Samantha Who - 2007) comes back to television with a fresh and humorous look at family (four families to be exact). With ""Parenthood"" off the air and other family dramas overly dramatic ""Empire,"" ""Life in Pieces"" features catchy dialogue that isn't sappy, relatable family situations, and a cast of lovable characters (including the fab Dianne Wiest, easy going James Brolin, and funny men Dan Bakkedahl and Colin Hanks to name just a few of the great cast). This new series is a reminder that good TV doesn't need to be filled with drama at every turn. ""Life in Pieces"" is sure to be one of this seasons good family TV viewing experiences.",/review/rw4947154/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2020,lonanichol,10," Crack up laughing every episode!
",This show is so relatable in many ways! The family is close and everything that comes out of their mouths is hilarious. I would hang out with them!! This show will stay in my list because I will definitely rewatch it one day.,/review/rw4947154/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2019,rosco-56852,10," Such a Shame
",It's a a shame when a clever well written show with great characters and great chemistry is cancelled. Yet mind numbing shows geared towards idiots (Pretty much anything involving Chuck Lorre) is kept on the air. Guess we also need more time slots for NCIS 12,/review/rw4947154/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2015,aswilliams40,9," A Great Full Comedy Cast of Characters
","I love the show I love the Actors/actresses the kids the plots the comedy it's hilarious; the only thing is they could Almost do an 1hr show easily some of their individual skits are great and I feel need to be longer they are so funny. The kids are just perfect; the couples all fit so Great together in their comedy. I look forward to this next episode every week. I was a breaking bad addict so seeing Betsey Brandt in anything is a plus for me. James Brolin doesn't age and is hilarious. Everyone of these actors/actresses are considered people I'd watch in anything they are in; just because of ""Life in Pieces"". Keep it up guys Great Comedy sitcom.",/review/rw4947154/?ref_=tt_urv

23 May 2019,timhofer-22303,10," Have not seen a smarter and funnier show ever !
","The show is smart, funny and and tugs at your heart as you join this family and their life. The writers are very talented fitting in big topics in little stories. And the cast is as equally talented bringing to life the stories. Love this show!",/review/rw4947154/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2017,moveebuff1953,9," Pure Brilliance...
",I'm a hard person please when it comes to comedy but Life in Pieces has me laughing out loud. The cast is perfect...the writing is brilliant. Haven't seen James Brolin in anything for quite a while & never knew he was a natural comic. Colin Hanks is just as versatile in his comedic talent. I don't it would do him justice to compare him to his Academy award winning father but to say that he has inherited his father's talent is an understatement. This ensemble of brilliant performers gets it right. Guest appearances only add to the enjoyment. The subject matters that are dealt with hold so true to life & that makes it even more enjoyable. So glad I stumbled on this TV show...especially since I've been hit by a horrible flu & this has definitely lifted my spirits.,/review/rw4947154/?ref_=tt_urv

",Every actor is spot on in their respective role. Some of the best laugh out loud lines delivered by all! The child actors are superb. Believable and hilarious family situations. So far the best tv comedy I have ever seen to date.,/review/rw4947154/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2019,robertemerald,9," Competition for Modern Family
","Life In Pieces doesn't try to be a modern family. Its values are rather pedestrian. It doesn't really matter. I've watched about 16 episodes and there was a good laugh in every one, and the rest was a broad smile. Several of the actors will be familiar faces and you'll be surprised at how good they are. Many of the situations you'll have experienced yourself. The writing and timing are brilliant. There's no fat on the bone. There is overall a lot of love between these people, which is refreshing to watch. It all amounts to really great fun, and a near perfect family comedy.",/review/rw4947154/?ref_=tt_urv
