28 January 2016,lnvicta,7," Not a great movie, but a must-see for fans of the classic show.
","Entourage isn't a very good movie. It's hard to even call it a movie because it's basically Entourage season 9 crammed into an hour and a half theatrical film. It picks up right where the show left off and continues with the same subtle banter humor and Ari Gold proving again why he's one of the best characters ever written. People who haven't seen the show will be confused, or at least bored, with the characters because they really have no development throughout this movie. There are simply too many characters to make a movie like this work. A mini-series? Absolutely. It would've been great to flesh out some of these subplots with multiple episodes. But a feature film? It doesn't quite work.",/review/rw3316759/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2015,randomStuff101,5," It's for fans who miss the show
","It's no masterpiece, but they weren't aiming for that. It's for fans of the show who want to see the boys back together. A kind of celebration of Entourage, with cameos all over the place - fun to watch. It's lost some charm of the TV show, but it's still escapism and entertainment.",/review/rw3316759/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2015,israelgodinezcastillo,9," A very good movie if you are a lover of the series.
","You probably don't understand the movie or like it if you never watch the series, but if you watched the series you probably love it, is great the last adventure of the gang, so you will enjoy a one last time of entourage in 140 minutes of memories and comedy. If you don't watch the series, you may probably see this movie and don't understand a thing, or maybe you probably don't find it funny, so my advice is very simple, if you watch the full series, you're gonna love it, if you don't you can probably say that this movie is bad, but personally i love it. The movie follow the story and doesn't miss a detail of it. PS: i love Johnny Drama.",/review/rw3316759/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2015,terry-nicolau,9," If you loved the TV show you will love the movie. If you didn't then you may not really.
","If you were an avid fan of the TV show you will LOVE this movie and be waiting for the next one. Throw in our favorite 4 is back, Ari Gold being well ARI GOLD, an interesting but simple story line and a cameo of guest star appearances from basically everyone Mark Walberg knows or who he has acted with and it works so well!",/review/rw3316759/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2015,SnoopyStyle,5," The gang is back!
","Vincent Chase is married but his wife walks out on their honeymoon. He decides to have a party and his former agent now Studio boss Ari Gold offers him a big role. He would do it only if he gets to direct. Some time later, the movie is almost done but over budget. Ari Gold is not happy and has to get the money from Texan Larsen McCredle and his son Travis. He's stressed as usual. Lloyd Lee is getting married. E's ex Sloan is having his baby. Vince is hot for Emily Ratajkowski. Turtle is now rich and he fights Ronda Rousey.",/review/rw3316759/?ref_=tt_urv

6 June 2015,The-Sarkologist,4," The Hollywood lifestyle
","Well, this is actually a review by somebody who has never seen the series, and probably won't end up seeing it either if this movie is anything to go by, which wasn't really much. Okay, I didn't necessarily think it was boring, and it did give me a few laughs along the way, and unlike some other movies that tend to wind up series (such as Serenity) it did make some sense, despite there being limited backstory to the characters. Mind you, you probably don't need much of a backstory anyway – Vince is an actor that hit it big time and decided to bring all of his friends to Hollywood with him so that they can live the lifestyle. That in itself makes the character quite admirable, especially since a lot of people who do hit it big end up dumping their old friends for a bunch of hangers on who in the end are only interested in their money.",/review/rw3316759/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2015,prospectus_capricornium,4," Unsatisfyingly Vapid and Laughably Tawdry
","ENTOURAGE, the movie adaptation of the HBO series with the same title, has too many concerns to juggle with its utterly vapid and tawdry script. It's almost always expected that stories with multiple lead characters eventually suffer through bland and unfocused narrative, part of which may be atrributed to the fact that most of such screenplays generally fit for long-term storytelling. Such flaw is inevitably at large in this big screen take of the 8-season series.",/review/rw3316759/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2015,robsta23,4," Barely Passable - Even If You Watched the Show
","My favorite aspect of the show? Ari. What was lacking? A lot, but especially good Ari moments that had me rooting for him all the way in the show. I'll get back to that later, but first let's put things into perspective for the film as a whole.",/review/rw3316759/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2015,Troy_Campbell,4," Gold is gold, but the rest is crap.
","If you didn't watch the hugely popular HBO show that precedes this movie, then you can stop reading. Both the film and my review will have little of interest to you. Those who loved the TV series, prepare to be sorely disappointed, for this cinematic effort is reminiscent of the tedious and shallow final seasons rather than the energetic and exciting initial seasons. Going into cameo overdrive with a smug glee, there's a massive over-reliance on familiar faces (and naked women) to sustain the illusion you're in the throes of a superstar's life. With a threadbare plot and zero character development, Vinnie Chase (Adrian Grenier) and his eponymous buddies E (Kevin Connolly), Turtle (Jerry Ferrara) and the agonizingly unfunny Drama (Kevin Dillon) are left to meander. Somehow spending time with the gang has become a chore rather than a pleasure. Their banter feels forced and their latest ""issues"" are tired rehashes of more compelling crises they faced on the show. Thank the Hollywood gods, however, for Ari Gold. Easily the series' greatest asset (with three Emmys and a Golden Globe to prove it), Jeremy Piven's exuberant and hostile mega-agent is once again a whirlwind of scathing sarcasm dishing up memorable lines and laugh-out-loud insults. The only other cast member who even warrants a mention is, astoundingly, Haley Joel Osmont; the former child star amusing as a confident Texan billionaire complete with bushy facial hair, bulging gut and a bad bedside manner. When Piven is on screen there are moments of Gold, but it's not enough to save this drearily repetitive cash-in.",/review/rw3316759/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2015,valleyjohn,4," This doesn't work as a film.
","I'm a fan of the TV series Entourage. I have seen every episode , so this was a much anticipated film for me and i was really interested to see if this would transfer well into a feature film. Sadly It didn't. I desperately wanted this to be good but if i have to be honest this felt like four average TV episodes back to back. The story revolves around Vincent Chase who is trying to get yet more funding for his first acting/directing role in his new movie. Vince and Ari try to convince the backers son ( played by sixth sense actor Haley Joel Osment ), who then takes a dislike to some of the cast. The irony of this story line is that this actual film had notorious problems in production and took ages to come out. It's ram packed full of celebrities making cameo appearance. Some i recognised but most i didn't. The truth is that Entourage doesn't work as a film . It comes across as a sexist , misogynist mess and that works well on TV because they are the characters. ( perhaps i'm getting old). I'm a fan and i didn't like it , so i dread to think what people who had never seen the series must have thought of it. Extremely disappointing .",/review/rw3316759/?ref_=tt_urv

22 November 2021,dtnmusic,9," VICTORY!!!!!!
","Saw this when it was originally released, just saw it again after rewatching the entire series. It definitely holds up and all things considered, it did a great job staying true to the series while jumping to the big screen. Every actor is exactly as they were a few years earlier, which isn't always the case with these kind of movies. The plot was believable and could have easily been the basis of season 9. Arie and Drama as usual steal all the scenes and when it all ended, I was left wanting more of my entourage.",/review/rw3316759/?ref_=tt_urv

7 September 2015,cosmo_tiger,7," For someone who never watched the show I did enjoy this much more than I expected to. Fans of the show may like it a lot.
","""It doesn't matter what a movie costs, only what it makes."" Vince (Grenier) is trying to decide on his next movie project. When he chooses a big budget special effects driven movie everyone is excited, until he announces he want's to direct. His new agent Ari (Piven) is willing to help him, but when a problem occurs with the financiers the movie, and everyone's careers are on the line. I have never seen this series. The reason I never wanted to see it was that the characters, from what I saw in the previews, really bugged me. It seemed like a Sex in the City with men and the self absorbed-ness of that really turned me off. I had that mindset going in to this. I have to say that I did think the movie was actually really entertaining. A few of the characters did really annoy me and based off of that I still will not watch the series. The characters are fine in small doses, so that said I will admit that I liked this movie. Overall, for someone who never watched the show I did enjoy this much more than I expected to. Fans of the show may like it a lot. I surprisingly give it a high B.",/review/rw3316759/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2015,LunarPoise,1," glib, nasty, dumb
","Knowing nothing of the TV show I wandered into this film expecting a parody of celebrity culture. After viewing, I got home and Google-ed 'Entourage misogyny.' The results of that search confirmed that I am not alone in wondering how such a stream of women-hating invective made it to our screens, attracting big-name cameos along the way.",/review/rw3316759/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2015,yankeemvp,8," Much better then it got credit for. Fans will love it
","The boys pick up right where the series ended and they don't skip a beat. Ari is quick to offer Vince the lead role in his first picture as studio head. Only problem is Vince has decided the next movie he does he also wants to direct. So with the movie going over budget with the boys focus quite a few problems as usual. Plus turtle is now a multi- multimillionaire just thought I should mention that. Now Vince is having problems with the financers of the movie over a girl. Not only does he want drama replaced he also wants Vinny the star and director replaced, are you willing to put anything on the line to stop that. Great for fans only problem I had with it is that it had to squeeze a season worth of material into a half and hour movie. People who have not seen the show will be able to follow along although they will not get many references that people who watch the show will. There was plans to make a sequel and possibly a trilogy but with low box office success that unfortunately may not be the case. Hopefully they can come up with a budget to at least make a sequel. Plus there's cameos from about anyone you can think of from common to Russell Wilson to Mark Wahlberg to Liam Neeson. Definitely worth checking out especially if you're a fan of the show.",/review/rw3316759/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2015,skin666,1," Total Garbage
","I was a fan of the show. I loved it, but the movie is just total garbage. I almost fell asleep twice. Every single episode is better than everything they combined to put in this film. You know the feeling when you know exactly what is going to happen and it happens? Well, that's exactly what I got from Entourage the Movie. The score this movie got here is the best example how irrelevant and fake IMDb has become... or how corrupt the scoring system is. You can pick the version of the truth you like the most, still it won't change the fact. If you still haven't seen this movie, just wait for it on the TV. Don't waste your money. One of my favorite shows, one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.",/review/rw3316759/?ref_=tt_urv

4 October 2015,roslansky,1," Terrible
","I was excited to see this movie because I was a fan of Entourage. I was severely disappointed. There is no point to this movie at all. None what-so-ever. The acting is horrible! I struggled to watch it all the way through. I wish I had not wasted my time and money on this one. It was much more shallow than the series. There was no depth at all to any of the characters. Not a single joke made me laugh. There were plenty of surprise appearances that were so insignificant they didn't even make it worth watching. There were hot cars, beautiful people, and gorgeous houses but no substance. Definitely a failed attempt. Again, the acting was awful!! I do not recommend this movie to anyone.",/review/rw3316759/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you haven't seen Mark Kermode's (A well respected film critic in the UK) 10 minute rant about this film which nails it (just search online) to summarise, this film is terrible from start to finish, is it totally vacuous of any soul, the people are all obnoxious, the subject matter is basically consumerism and sexism for an hour and a half it is just awful and it leaves you cold that this is what young people are suppose to aspire to.",/review/rw3316759/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2016,Scarecrow-88,3," Entourage
","Hot-shot Hollywood producer Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven) comes out of retirement to help get his star commodity (Adrian Grenier) a directorial gig for which he also star. It seems Gold will be running his own studio, but being beholden to Texas billionaire (Billy Bob Thornton) and his doofus son (Haley Joel Osment) does him no favors when the movie pretty boy Vince (Grenier) is directing goes over budget (and needs further financing). Meanwhile the movie follows the further exploits of Vinnie's entourage in and about Hollywood. Insider-Hollywood claptrap will probably go over well with those who operate within the confines of the movie business, but if you have no interest in the affairs of these kinds of people (actors, studio execs, producers, financiers, and the hangers-on which attach themselves to anyone with money and lots of it), this will not go down well unless a steady dose of Pepto is on hand. Vapid, shallow lifestyles are so much fun to followif you are among them. Hell, Vinnie is posed to us as this kind-hearted Hollywood star who treats his boys quite well (leeches who have financially reaped from this association; lucky friends and brother they are!), while poor Ari must endure the pratfalls of studio bosses and moneymen wanting to see his star's product before paying another dime.

","I'm a huge fan of Entourage the T.V series so was a little nervous that the film wouldn't live up to that standard.... But It does, it is HILARIOUS from start to finish. Drama and Ari steal the Movie as they do the series! It's crude, rude and close to the bone.

There's really not much else going on in this movie, the plot could have been written on toilet paper such is its quality.
