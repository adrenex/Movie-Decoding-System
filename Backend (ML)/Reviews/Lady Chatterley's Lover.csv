5 December 2022,stevelivesey67,6," A decent attempt but a cold, unerotic, by the numbers affair.
","It looks good. The acting of the 2 leads is convincing and yet there is no heat, no chemistry and no peril in what they may loose.",/review/rw8710661/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2022,anne-ecobichon,7," Do not understand the hate
","I truly do not understand why this movie is so reviled. I have read all D. H. Lawrence and most people fail (or do not wish to) understand that his main purpose was the study of social inequities and their devastating effect on British Society in the early 20th Century. All is work tends to illustrate that. Lady Chatterley's Lover is a prime example of that beyond the scandal around its publication. It is the first time that I truly see this aspect in an adaptation as well as the sex not being necessarily pretty and romantic. Their relationship is the closest one to the book I have ever seen. So haters pass your way, the cast, direction, cinematography everything rings true.",/review/rw8710661/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2022,juanmuscle,10," I thought this was!
","So sweet! I don't think I have seen anything that looks this gorgeous and beautiful and amazing in a long long long long long time! I have listened to the audio-book and it seems to have changed the ending and yeah some of the narrative which I find to be a lil' too invasive in the novel is removed here, but the ending here is so sweet! I loved it so much! I have to say! The two very different mediums and similar stories but I think the endings is what sets this apart, the journey experience are both really wonderful this is really neat and tight while the book is thorough and you learn a lot from the wise narrative but to look at! Wow! This is extra-ordinary! Really stunning! The director here did a fine fine fine very fine job! Exquisite! Thank-you Netflix!",/review/rw8710661/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,cgvsluis,5," Lust filled adaptation of D.H.Lawrence's novel with both male and female full frontal nudity but lacking in the love and foul language of the original material.
","Based on the notorious last and often banned novel by D. H. Lawrence this film is it's most recent adaptation. Set during WWI Lord Clifford Chatterly marries Connie Reid. He almost immediately goes back to the front where he is injured in the war. When he comes home he is unable to father children or use his legs. He moves his wife to his family's country estate, taking her out of the bustling London that she loves. Isolated and alone, Lady Chatterly becomes more of a caretaker than lover to her husband. In this version her husband discusses with her the idea that she could discreetly choose a lover to impregnate her so that they could have an heir, sine he can not father one...it only they know that. He set boundaries, that he trusted her judgment, but never wanted to know who the true father is. At first she is upset by his suggestion, but starts taking long walks by herself where she eventually meets the estate's gamekeeper and former soldier himself Oliver Mellors. Eventually Oliver and Connie start a torrid affair that does end up with her being pregnant.",/review/rw8710661/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2022,nojazzhere,7," Why the Hate?
","First let me say that it's been 45-50 years since I read Lady Chatterley's Lover in college.....and other than the title and a few names, I don't remember anything about it. Thus, I can't say if this film has anything in common with the book. As I watched the film unfold, I struggled for any ""recognition"" of scenes and situations, without success. But that said, I fail to understand the ""hate"" that some reviewers are giving this film. Perhaps it's NOT like the classic D. H. Lawrence book, but taken on its own, it has some real appeal. I can't recall if the book had such ""modern"" woman aspects, and the film is occasionally a bit tedious in its ""blame the Patriarchy"" for everything......but that's simply to be expected in film making today. With its copious nudity, it certainly meets today's ""Netflix"" standards of having women-centric stories, and enough female flesh to hold the men's interest. The quality of acting and photography are actually outstanding. (although the extreme use of the color purple in lighting and clothing became very jarring at times) So, regardless as to how it compares to the source book, this film is very enjoyable and entertaining, both for male and female viewers. Please don't believe the critics who say otherwise, and give it a view......I think you will appreciate it.",/review/rw8710661/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2022,sme3,6," The Cliff's Notes Version
","This production of LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER neatly summarizes the plot of the novel upon which it is based, and it retains a surprising amount of the naughty bits that earned the novel its notoriety. In the process of condensing the story, the filmmakers lost some of its emotional appeal. Emma Corrin in particular brings depth to an underwritten role, but the rest of the cast capably acquit themselves with similarly underdeveloped material. Unfortunately, the romance often feels more like something that hits the beats of the story rather than something genuine and romantic or erotic. Most of the production values are good.",/review/rw8710661/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2022,Rod Evan,3," Inspired by characters created by...
","Almost 100 years since D H Lawrence published his superbly written expose of class inequality and hypocrisy, and 60 years since the book was cleared in the obscenity trial, you would have thought society would have progressed to the extent of being able to accept and value it for what it is: sexually honest and explicit. But if this Netflix adaptation is anything to go by, we have not progressed.",/review/rw8710661/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2022,rmassey21,10," Pleasantly surprised
","I didn't have any expectations, I haven't read the book (I think I will now though) but I know the story. So this isn't a comparison on the book and I love period pieces but I thought it was very well done. I would guess the bad reviews are people that object to this interpretation of the book. It reminds me a bit of Outlander.",/review/rw8710661/?ref_=tt_urv

8 December 2022,RainbowVic,10," D.W. Lawrence would be proud!
","Luminous, sexy, audacious!! Emma Corrin and Jack O'Connell are sumptuous. They capture all the passion and are thrilling to watch. So intoxicating a watch. I have never read the novel but will definitely seek out more D H Lawrence. There was nothing that made me think tawdry. It made me think the anger and outrage of its day was mainly that a woman empowered her sexuality and chose the man she loved and did not conform to the society role made for her. Rebellion and audacity... very sexy indeed. The stately home was gorgeous as well as the Welsh countryside. Well done, Netflix! More please of this calibre.",/review/rw8710661/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2022,Headturner11,4," Ugh
",I love Jack O'Conell and saw this come up when I was searching for something new a few weeks ago. So I anxiously waited. After Jacks most recent series Rogue heros I was really looking forward to it but had a feeling I would be disappointed! And disappointed I was! Firstly there is barely any character build. Emma Corrin was awful to pair with an actor on O'Conells level! Everything between them was rushed and I felt nothing between or for them. The sex scenes were awful and I had to look away sometimes because Corrin looked like she was in agony not ecstasy! None of the characters were likable or did I have any feeling for any of them. For an over 2 hour movie I wonder ( it seemed to fly by) what what was the focus because I certainly don't remember as I will forget about his by tomorrow.,/review/rw8710661/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,CriticsVoiceVideo,1," Dull and a bit goofy.
","After having seen at least four previous adaptations, this really is the worst of the lot. This film did not convey the story D. H. Lawrence is telling in his novel. It was about as erotic as a pound of ground beef. The nudity is done in a silly manner, especially involving the male. Nothing enticing or smoldering about him. In fact, I found both leads utterly unappealing with and without clothes. Where was the famous gardener showering scene that originally stirs her loins in the first place? This movie is lacking in so many areas. It was all so generic and bland. If you want to see this story on film, then stick to the previous versions or just read the novel which is a thousand times better than any filmed adaptation. Even ""Young Lady Chatterley's Lover"" conveys more of the story than this dreck and the color palette of this film is just dreadful. Just like the film itself, it's dreary and dull. Heed my warning and skip this snoozefest. Very disappointing.",/review/rw8710661/?ref_=tt_urv

4 December 2022,ozjosh,7," D.H. Lawrence meets Mills & Boon
","While not completely awful, this latest adaptation feels a bit like the suburban woman's book club version of Lady Chatterley's Lover. Connie is given a light feminist makeover, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but in most respects the writing and the direction loses the muscularity and the rawness of the novel. The scene with Connie and Oliver frolicking naked in the rain is emblematic of this director's approach. It's cute and maybe a tad naughty, rather than erotically charged or daring or liberating. And poor Mellors, while beautifully played by Jack O'Connell, feels somewhat emasculated by both the script and the tepid direction. It's also telling that they chose a boyish, svelte, hairless, almost twinkish type like O'Connell, who doesn't exactly embody Mellors as written by Laurence. So it's fair to say this movie is more Connie's story than it is Mellor's. The actors are fine though - particularly Joely Richardson as Mrs Bolton. And the cinematography is some compensation for the lack of literary cred.",/review/rw8710661/?ref_=tt_urv

7 December 2022,erostew,5," Does Not Exceed Low Expectations
","This is just another one of the many films that gets remade over and over again. The remakes never get any better, in fact often the reverse. And this film fulfills that formula perfectly. It's dumbed down, unsexy and uninteresting.",/review/rw8710661/?ref_=tt_urv

22 October 2022,euroGary,4," Does the world need yet another adaptation of ""Lady Chatterley's Lover""?

4 December 2022,sbh-73020,5," Thoroughly Mediocre, sadly.
","Their lack of chemistry between Corin and O'Connell makes the whole thing a wasted opportunity. Jack O'Connell is fantastic actor but this performance I feel, falls short of his usual mesmerising presence. There isn't the roughness to Mellors that you'd expect. Connie is insipid. Corin is usually excellent but this just misses. This story is so familiar and has been done so many times that we know the characters well, and we root for them, but it's difficult to care for either Connie or Mellors in this, they are so very bland there's little between them but fresh air. There is nothing here suggesting that they yearn for each other. There are many adaptations of Lady Chatterley's Lover and I'd say most, if not all are are head and shoulders above this. Sadly. I wanted to love it. On paper Jack O'Connell is an excellent Mellors, what's went wrong? Such a shame.",/review/rw8710661/?ref_=tt_urv

5 December 2022,andryskovabl,5," Superficial. Male protagonist subdued and in the background.
","I read the book and what bothered me most was the subdued, censored Mellors in the film. Like he was not really there... Mellors in the book used simple, sensual language to express his joy over Connie's body and their sex together. He actually talked more than Connie during their encounters ... and those who read the story know HOW he talked...Mellors in the film was kind of always in the background and does not almost talk at all let alone use this beautiful foul language of his...Where was his male presence? Too politically incorrect for today's audience? Why does this great story get censored again? This time not due to sex scenes involved but à la woke, hey, it is the woman alone, who has reins in the hand... the male counterpart is unimportant and passive in the film. In the story it is not Connie who makes the first step in the hut... well of course it takes two, but it was actually Mellors who started it... too audacious for today? Today Mellors had to be just nice and in the background and only be there at Connies disposal in the first scene.... Why was Mellors' presence so limited and his masculinity put totally in the background? Connie on the other hand was androgynous and looked like a 13-year- old boy. In the book she was described as feminine with hips and normal body. Sex scenes sterile and supposed to look ""beautiful ""and the scene in the rain just stupid and awkward. OMG especially this scene was supposed to be sensual and full of unrestrained sexual desire. It felt like two kindergarten kids goofing around in the rain with their clothes off it was so stupid I had to look away..many important moments from the book missing, Connie and Michaelis, Mellors meeting Connie's father, The fact that Mellors actually had a kid was left out...",/review/rw8710661/?ref_=tt_urv

","Give this beautiful profuction a chance. I read some of the bad reviews after I watched it and wondered if we watched the same film. I have seen several movies based on the controversial D. H. Laurence novel and this is by far the best one. The cast is first class and there is an effortless sensual chemistry between Emma Corrin and Jack O'Connell. It is true that there is quite a lot of nudity including full frontal, but it is not gratituous at all, and is done in good taste. I agree with the reviewer that said that in this case the movie is better than the scandalous 1928 book that inspired it.",/review/rw8710661/?ref_=tt_urv
