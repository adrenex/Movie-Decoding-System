13 May 2013,slash83_mus,8," Rought start for a great show
","Revolution is one of those shows that gets buried under a load of criticism for showing the viewers a future they can't identify themselves with. All of a sudden plot holes become so important to the general public, they use every single one of them to burn the show down, even if these plot holes haven't had a chance to be explained by the writers because the show is only half-way in it's first season.",/review/rw2809169/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2013,awishandadream,10," I Look forward to it each week!
","I was shocked to see all the negative reviews. Perhaps I feel different because I'm not really looking for reality when I watch TV. I'm looking for entertainment. I'm looking to take a break and relax. (Most generally I have enough reality in a normal day, but if I'm looking for more on TV, I'll turn on the news) As for Revolution, I really enjoy the Drama. I find myself drawn into what the writers, and actors give with this show each week. There are some characters, I love to hate, and others I'm cheering on! I now make it a point to watch it when it comes on, or if I can't - I make sure the DVR is set, and watch it later. :)",/review/rw2809169/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2012,findingdevotion,1," Lame effort from Eric Kripke
",To describe the premise as unrealistic would mean nothing as nobody should expect realism from what is essentially a post-apocalyptic sci-fi flick. ,/review/rw2809169/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2012,riverzak,," Typical JJ Abrams Drek
","What we have is another production by JJ Abrams. Unfortunately that translates to BAD. In an interview, Abrams claims that the science makes sense. Sorry. If batteries (electro-chemical) don't work then neither do people. Our bodies run on electro-chemical processes. So there goes the science. But crap science, after all, is a staple of JJ Abrams. After all, in Star Trek he had Spock watch the destruction of the planet Vulcan from the surface of another planet in another star system WITH HIS NAKED EYES! Next I have to wonder how, after fifteen years, people can still be wearing fresh, white, machine-made clothing. I guess it wouldn't look good to have everyone walking around in sheepskins. Bu why not leather? Last, but not least, there is the JJ Abrams specialty. Billion-to-one coincidences. Again, in his absolute drek of a reboot of Star Trek, one coincidence (among so many) was having Kirk marooned within walking distance on the same planet as Spock and Scotty. In Revolution, the three questers enter a random building after entering Chicago. The first person they talk to is (what a bloody amazing coincidence) the very person they are looking for.",/review/rw2809169/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2013,jason-697-936376,9," Almost End of Season 1
","Well, I watched Revolution from the beginning of Season 1. I am an Electrical Engineer and I said ""Lets just negate physics for the sake of a television show"" for a little while. I wasn't very amused in the beginning and boredom really just kept me watching this show. So, as I said, boredom kept me watching and the reasoning behind the electrical blackout was interesting. The characters began to grow on me and I slowly started to enjoy the overall storyline. Is this a Shakespeare play??? NO, but it is a bit of fun in the end. Just kick back, drink some rum and coke, microwave some popcorn and enjoy the FUN! I think we should be into season 3 or 4, but just at the end of season 1. OH, and I love Elizabeth Mitchell!!!",/review/rw2809169/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2013,taayhdd,10," It's not as bad as everyone says...
","In 'Revolution' the power is out, militia has taken over and the government has fallen. I feel as if the reviews on this series don't do it justice. It could be argued that it isn't the most realistic portrayal of what would happen if the power went out but, who actually knows what would happen? For me, I watch movies/series to entertain myself and this is exactly what this provides, entertainment. I don't watch movies or films and question their attempts to get it close to reality, I appreciate the entertainment. The character development is good in my eyes, 'Monroe' and 'Miles' used to be leaders of the 'Militia'. Miles dropped out from power and Monroe has now gone insane with his power, after killing thousands they are both pretty much cold- hearted, which leads to some gruesome deaths. They keep dropping clues and hints about how and why the power was turned off. The characters have good links with each other and every episode is more entertaining. After nearly watching the first season of 'Revolution' I am happy to say that it is awesome, I am kept very entertained through out and feel emotion to some characters.

24 October 2012,bartning,7," Electricity or Electric Current?
","The premise of _Revolution_--that electricity does not work--is both simple and complex at the same time. However, is that really the show's premise? Moreover, there are twelve devices where each one allows electric current to flow in a local area around it, and, apparently, having all twelve of these objects could let electricity flow again all over the world. While the show hasn't explained all the particulars--almost all of them really--it works because those who make have kept it plausible. It also works because of the premise, something I appreciate very much--so far at least.",/review/rw2809169/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2012,ween-3,," ""But when you talk about destruction...don't you know that you can count me out""
","""Revolution"" has it all. Bad writing. Bad acting. Bad premise. The trifecta.

27 September 2012,russmillerwy-957-682439,3," lacks sophistication, typical 1970s-era comic book scifi
","When I was a child of the 1970s, I really loved Six Million Dollar Man, Bionic Woman, Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, and pretty much any other kind of scifi out there. What was their formula? Big imaginative premise (bionics, space battles, people who turn green when they get mad), a good looking cast of good guys and girls, and mean bad guys and girls. When better scifi came along, scifi that engaged me as an adult, my tastes changed and I could no longer really enjoy the old stuff the way I did when I was little. Love them or slam them, Lost, the new Battlestar and Star Treks raised the bar for what we expect of character development, complex morality, believability, story consistency, and adult themes.

27 September 2012,darkeyes9090,1," A waste of electricity watching it
","The show is, to elegantly sum it up, quite horrible. As so many have noted, the science (planes fall straight down out of the sky, muskets, no steam power etc.) is bad enough, but could be ignored with suspended disbelief, if the remaining criteria for a well done show didn't also fall flat.",/review/rw2809169/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2012,Smiling_slinky,8," Favorite TV series of the last 5 years

30 January 2014,Shopaholic35,5," Good idea, no follow through
",When this show first aired I was really intrigued by the idea and thought it had so many possibilities to explore. Unfortunately the writers seem to have run out of ideas. Now in the middle of the second season and I feel like the show is not going anywhere and lacks energy. It feels tired and the cast seems defeated and too exhausted. I also feel that there is no point to the show anymore and all the different character stories seem messy and ill thought out.,/review/rw2809169/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2013,brechan,1," Intellectual black hole...
","I had hopes for this show as I enjoy the post apocalypse genre....however, after viewing two episodes of this pathetic waste of time and money I have decided that this is, without a doubt, filled with some of the most unbelievable characters and situations populating any current TV series. The fat geek, who as others have said is 'still' the fat geek...even after living under near starvation conditions for 15 years. The spoiled, self-entitled, virgin queen who whines and snivels about every decision being made. The emasculated ex-militia general who caves every time the virgin queen whines. The list goes on and on. These people consistently make so many mind-numbingly stupid choices, that in fact none of them would have lasted 15 days, much less 15 years. I found myself hoping that some of the zombies from The Walking Dead would shamble on into this show and finish everyone off. Spare yourself...change channels.",/review/rw2809169/?ref_=tt_urv

","Okay, I wasted 2 hours of my life watching the first 2 episodes. Unfortunately on IMDb, you are required to leave 10 lines of review to get it to post. I could have reviewed this show with 2 words.... IT STINKS! But I can't get it to post with so little about the show. Okay, let me try harder. Oh, the show has terrible acting, and I was hoping the main character (Charlie) would fall on her own arrow. Annoying character that you cannot feel anything for and actually root against. I was hoping one of those Hunger Games kids would suddenly show up and take her out. Also, the story, it seems written by high schoolers! Do the writers think their audience is ignorant. Just because 60% of Americans can't find their own country on a map doesn't mean..... Okay, maybe they are. Let's move on.... Oh I think I've typed enough now to get this posted, so where was I? Oh, Revolutions.... It STINKS!",/review/rw2809169/?ref_=tt_urv

3 October 2012,neonrt-492-48717,9," i have fun yelling at the TV
","i watched two episodes and i find myself yelling at the characters on the TV because they seem to do the opposite of what real people would do. Like for example the general that sent one man at a time to try to run past the sniper , well the sniper only can shoot one at a time, how easy was that, How about send everyone at once... Or when the girl who was pulling the helicopter got freed, she got freed but later complained that she got freed but didn't have time to explain why as he was freeing her. It took her two seconds to explain , she had more than that as they were untying her. i never see anyone eat or drink. No one is suppose to have guns but the guy shot a deer in the day and got caught. Handed over his gun and was killed, why even come to the door? Run out the back door, or shoot your deer at dusk. I will watch this until i find out why the power went out and probably yell at the TV when i find out. It better not be aliens.... I watch this show because nothing else is on that night and for the hope that it gets better. I lost a little hope when the woman said there are 12 necklaces that have the power... Time to find a hobbit. To the guy who said : this is the reason legend of the seeker got canceled : NO i loved that show these are not even in the same ball park. EDIT. I only watch tis show to pick on the stupid things and I got the best laugh ever.NO AIR IN THE SUBWAY. Wow how impossible is that. I should go to see the producer of the show and shut his office door, maybe he will hallucinate a better show. You could have said it was a gas leak or something vs no air in a place the size of a football stadium.",/review/rw2809169/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2014,SnoopyStyle,6," Promised so much but with so many problems
",It's 15 years after all electricity has gone out. The modern world has collapsed and replaced by brutal dictatorships. A Monroe militia led by Tom Neville (Giancarlo Esposito) has come to an idyllic farming community. A fight breaks out and Danny is taken prisoner. His sister Charlie Matheson (Tracy Spiridakos) and others including Aaron Pittman (Zak Orth) try to rescue him. She tracks down their uncle Miles Matheson (Billy Burke) to help. The Monroe Republic is run by Sebastian Monroe (David Lyons) and Miles used to be his second in command. Monroe is holding their mother Rachel Matheson (Elizabeth Mitchell) prisoner. She was a scientist involved in the project that went wrong. The project manufactured nanobots that are now spread worldwide sucking up all the electricity.,/review/rw2809169/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2012,stfual,2," Post apocalyptic middle America soap opera
","I've given Revolution five episodes because I love post apocalyptic dramas and films generally but this really is awful. Forget the fact that the plot is full of holes and general stupidity. Apparently 18 years after wars and the end of civilization everyone has discovered the secrets of moisturizer, hair gel, makeup, and they have invented the non-electric travel iron and curling tongs. Also they have access to an endless supply of clean push up bras and flimsy outfits. ",/review/rw2809169/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2013,melis541,10," I really like this show.
","I feel as though people may have watched MAYBE the first few episodes and then casted it off. I to agree that the first six or seven episodes are horrible but I continued to watch and fell in love with the show. Once Danny is found the show really kicks off, and gets even better when he dies. I don't really look that much into the behind story and if it would happen and what not. It's TV... It's supposed to entertain you not be something you stress over. ",/review/rw2809169/?ref_=tt_urv

","This show was god awful right from the very beginning. I had high hopes for this show, as the concept is original and i didn't think it would be an easy one to screw up. Boy was i wrong. I was expecting this to be as well conceived and directed as the last J.J. Abrams show i had watched, Fringe. In truth, it just makes him look bad. This is worse then all of the times Lost jumped the shark put together. The entire cast is so ill conceived and poorly written, with no real sense of character or internal conflict other then a bunch of whiny crap about how much of a monster Monroe is. Monroes self destructiveness is almost comical, the entire show is extremely pedestrian and it doesn't take a genius to realize they don't know what the hell they're talking about. The entire show i was thinking, i don't care about any of these people, when are they all going to die so i can stop watching this garbage?",/review/rw2809169/?ref_=tt_urv
