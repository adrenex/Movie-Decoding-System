24 September 2018,jbencker,9," For everyone
","This show centers around the girl Hilda who lives in a phantastical world featuring all sorts of creatures. Hilda is a very likeable character from the start: she is very brave, kind and always looking for an adventure but she isn't perfect. There are also great side characters like her mother, her friends David and Frieda and a number of mythical creatures. The show proves to be very imaginative as it comes up with many quirky and pecuilar creatures, putting a new spin on familiar concepts.",/review/rw4758696/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2018,elicopperman,8," Mysterious, Adorable and Heartwarming in Every Right Way
","Imagine what would happen if you combined the fantasy elements of Gravity Falls and Over the Garden Wall, and mix them in with both the practical humor of Calvin and Hobbes and the family and friend bonds of Laika's best works. You'd get a simple albeit engaging graphic novel turned cartoon series like Hilda. It's always good to stream new content on Netflix, because then you discover adorably wholesome gems like this.",/review/rw4758696/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2019,petra_ste,9," The blue-haired girl who talks to monsters
","This lovely animated series, with its grace and magical realism, reminds me of the works of the great Hayao Miyazaki. It's aimed at children, but adults can enjoy it as well - I certainly did.",/review/rw4758696/?ref_=tt_urv

",The show is very lovely with beautiful art styles and has a sense of feeling like home when Hilda goes on those adventures you feel like your with her it is kiddish but something always interests you to watch more and I highly recommended completing the series and not only the art style but music like the theme song was really beautiful,/review/rw4758696/?ref_=tt_urv

8 December 2018,planktonrules,9," A rather amazing cartoon!
","""Hilda"" is a British-made series about a strange little girl who lives in Scandinavia...and it's now being brought to the States by Netflix. It's a most unusual show...one that apparently has been approved for a second season and that is good news.",/review/rw4758696/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2018,cakepops-49695,10," Hilda is amazing for every age!
","I absolutley love everything about this show! The art is amazing and so creative, the imagination that went into the show entirely is amazing! I had originally put this show on for my little one and instead i got caught up watching the show like a zombie with him. (No cleaning was done haha) It really is fun for all ages! It also teaches children and whom ever is watching it about compassion and communication so you can pull something educational from every episode. And let's be honest the world can always use more of that! And It always has something new in every episode that keeps you hooked all the way thru the entire season! I hope they create a second season!!!!!",/review/rw4758696/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2018,kvothetraspie,10," Good character driven stories
","Very good show, the animation is extremely well done, and the character designs are charming, the show is very light hearted but surprisingly so they manage to keep that tone while keeping the tension on the adventures, I felt the first episode was on the slow side, but I stuck to it and watched the whole thing, if you do too you will find out why its getting so many good reviews.",/review/rw4758696/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2020,matteoquadra,10," Melancholy at its finest
","This feels so much like childhood. It a cozy fall evening near the fire. The colours and the artistic direction is stunning. In my childhood I used to read Calvin & Hobbes and Peanuts and it feels like going back to those small lighthearted adventures where you're immagnation is the limit. The creatures seem to be coming out of a child fantasy and they recall so much that part of me I always end up drowned in the atmosphere and wanting to come back to rewatch again the same adventure, for the simple feel of it, just like I'd always come back for the same old book of strips I had",/review/rw4758696/?ref_=tt_urv

26 September 2018,rachelgallit,," Nostalgically British
","This charmingly animated series is a delightful tale of childhood adventure. Hilda freshly moved to the city from her magical creature-infested forest home, navigates both supernatural pests and mundane social interactions with her school-mates. Hilda is attended by her elf-friend, Alfur, and a small deer fox, Twig, as well as human companions Frida and David, all of whom lend constructive perspectives on the events while playing an assigned archetype role. While formulaic, as most children's shows will be, the episodes capture a whimsical air of adventure and discovery, as Hilda continues to defy social expectations and dispel prejudices against the magical creatures she is ever so fond of. An outstanding detail to me, among the minutia of a well-orchestrated animated TV short, is the character integrity. Each character maintains flaws and principals in an entirely enjoyable and realistic manner. While still learning from mistakes, core traits are not switched at the drop of a hat, as often happens to antagonists in oversimplified children shows. Hilda is produced by Silvergate Media, a company known for successful children shows such as Octonauts (2010-present) and Peter Rabbit (2012-2016) and as such it is little surprise that the show has such simple elegance.",/review/rw4758696/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hilda is a show I did not expect to love as much as I do. What could've been passed off as a decent show for children turned out to be a fantastic show for all ages. With an amazing cast of characters, creative world building and strong writing, this show stands toe to toe with the likes of Steven Universe as one of the best cartoons from the 2010s.",/review/rw4758696/?ref_=tt_urv

","This deserves all the praise. 30 seconds into the 1st episode, when that music hits with an amazing intro into the warm and cold mixture of calming colour tones to the not overly-simplified yet beautiful, sunday newspaper comic strip type art, unique and lovable characters...it's just perfect. The world she lives in, the people/things she meet, the plot...gotta give props to Luke Pearson for his books and Silvergate Media and Mercury Filmworks for making the pages come to life...this is such a treat. The interactions between Hilda and her mother makes it better. ",/review/rw4758696/?ref_=tt_urv

25 April 2021,BabelAlexandria,8," Fantasy Scandinavian Slice of Life
","My 8-year-old daughter was a fan of the graphic novels--not a huge fan, but she read all of them. She was not really interested in this show for some reason. But my 6-year old son loved it, and watched it while his sister was at gymnastics. It has its share of suspense and fearful creatures, but on the whole manages to be almost slow paced, but in a positive way, which fits well with the slow unrolling of the mysteries of the woods, and the new city to which Hilda has moved with her mom.",/review/rw4758696/?ref_=tt_urv

","Ohhh my goodness! When i was browsing youtube one day, I came upon a Netflix commercial for this random show called Hilda. I thought to myself ""why not"" and clicked on the video. And let me tall you, that was a great decision. This new Netflix original is the best thing I have seen is months. It is a beautifully animated and coloured and no matter what your age, you should check it out. It might seem a bit boring to some people but if you liked Steven Universe or similar shows, chances are you will like this. Its a bit more catered to kids around the age of 7 to 11 but even I still find it amusing. I find they did an amazing job bringing this old comic back to life in animation form.",/review/rw4758696/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2018,ThatGFFAN,10," Everything you want from a show
","From the moment I first saw the trailer I knew this was going to be a show unlike any other. Watching it was one of the best decisions I ever made. From episode 1 all the way to episode 13, Hilda kept me hooked and wanting to see more. From amazing and lovable characters, smooth and breathtaking animation, a cast and crew that really brings the show to life and a feeling of nostalgia that you just cannot begin to comprehend. A lot of people are saying Hilda has many similarities to Gravity Falls and Over the Garden Wall. I don't. The show is first off based on Luke Pearson's Hildafolk comics that have been out since 2010, well before GF and OTGW ever aired. The shows are all original in their own way and I feel people need to watch shows without comparing them to others. It makes the viewing experience better and more enjoyable. Hilda is amazing in its own way. In some ways it did things better then Gravity Falls and OTGW did. I could go on about how amazing Hilda is but quite frankly, watching it for yourself and making your own decision on how good it is, is better then reading reviews from random people online. And be sure to read the original Hilda books as well. Luke Pearson's world will suck you in make you smile. Such is the life of an adventurer.",/review/rw4758696/?ref_=tt_urv

29 September 2018,Genti25,6," One of the best animated shows ever.
","Hilda brings out the best out of kids entertainment, and it pushes the boundaries as to just how meaningful and flat out amazing animation can be. This is a show for all ages, but especially show it to kids around the age of 8, they will remember it for years to come and it may just be a classic for them when they grow up. 
In a world full of bad things happening constantly, and even worse kids entertainment (i.e. the recent Netflix animated film 'Next Gen'), Hilda is exactly the type of show that might just teach kids a positive thing or two.",/review/rw4758696/?ref_=tt_urv

26 September 2018,CriticalOfEverything,8," Charming, adorable, and just the right amount of weird.
","Hilda immediately caught my attention the day it came out when people on my Twitter feed were going crazy about how great it was, so I decided to watch the entire show the next morning when I had time and I can safely say that this is among one of my favourite Netflix originals. The art style and animation are stunning, the animation is just the right amount of fluid and the art style is beautiful and really cute, there are moments from this show which I can use as my desktop background actually. Every episode is good and if you like shows with continuity then you'll probably love this show seeing as how every episode is connected. The characters are perfect, Hilda is a very charming and likeable character, same with her Mum, and David and Frieda are both fun characters to watch. Alfur is definitely my favourite character and there definitely needs to be a plushy of Twig in the future. The music is calming and nice to listen to, the intro is just perfect, and it's also very weird and creative. There are various takes on already existing creatures like elves and trolls and many other creatures that are about as weird as anything that Gravity Falls has, if not weirder in some cases. Whilst Gravity Falls is still a better mystery show with weird creatures, this is a much better show if we're talking about world building and adventure. There's just a ton of interesting lore here. Tis is definitely a very cute and charming adventure/mystery show that I would recommend to any fan of Gravity Falls or weird shows in general. It's not perfect in terms of a masterpiece, but it's perfect as the show that it wants to be, a heart-filled, adorable and interesting adventure show, and it's definitely a great one.",/review/rw4758696/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2019,invisibleunicornninja,7," Fantastical.
","I would highly recommend this story for fans of fantasy. While there isn't much of an overarching narrative, and not much happens, there's still lots of enjoyable adventures with unique fantasy concepts. The animation is simple, yet beautiful. I will say though, the story is very slice-of-life. There isn't really anything new or interesting attempted in terms of plot. The setting and atmosphere are good though. The characters are pretty good for the most part, but some are a bit one-note. I can't really think of any character developments that anyone goes through. Don't get me wrong, this show is very enjoyable to watch, but it feels like more could've gone into the overall story and not just the setting and the various wonderful moments that make up the show.",/review/rw4758696/?ref_=tt_urv
