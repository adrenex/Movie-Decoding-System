18 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,10," Absolutely Amazing!
","For All Mankind is a really good sci-fi mystery thriller that takes you down the road of ""what if"" during the space races. It takes place in a world where Russia beat is to the moon and the global space race never ended. While the show does has its flaw overall it is a very good show. The writing and acting are all terrific, especially Joel Kinnamon. The use of actual footage and real events just make the story that much better. Each episode gets better and better. I put off watching it for some reason and I'm now binging all 3 seasons and can't stop. If you've a sci-fi fan and have been putting it off like me...stop! Go watch this as soon as possible because I promise you won't be disappointed!",/review/rw8551660/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2022,Supermanfan-13,10," Better Than Expected!
",I have to say that I enjoyed For All Mankind a lot more than I thought I would. It's a character driven show that takes you into the lives of NASA astronauts and their families. It's a sci-fi show where Russia beat us to the moon and the great space races never ended. It may start off a little slow for some but after a few episodes you'll be hooked. It gets more exciting the further into the show you get. The visuals in this are amazing and how they take real footage and real life videos and intertwine them with fiction into the show is awesome. It's an intense sci-fi series that must be watched by any true sci-fi fan.,/review/rw8551660/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2022,alekspredator87,10," A life-long story about space, but first of all about people
","The project ""For the Sake of all mankind"" interested me primarily in alternative history. I have always admired the authors who skillfully gave out interesting stories in which the world went on a different development, turning at some point to a different vector. And the plot, where the first Soviet cosmonauts turned out to be on the moon, and not American ones, aroused my special interest. In addition, the project belongs to Apple TV+. This is also a kind of quality indicator for me.",/review/rw8551660/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,DLochner,8," Just great with a flawless look
","Just great - even if the series takes a few episodes to really get going, it just keeps getting better and better, especially in season one. The topic of space is certainly exciting, but the more you deal with it, the more you realize that it is not accessible to everyone. But what the show manages to do is take an incredibly good emotional look at astronauts. The background story is very good, especially with regard to the family background of the astronauts and their individual characters. I would not have thought that you could get so much out of this topic. Absolutely successful. So don't let the first episodes discourage you, it just keeps getting better and better. An exciting series with a flawless look.",/review/rw8551660/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,lee_eisenberg,8," how it could've gone
","The moon landing is widely seen as one of humanity's greatest achievements, and a crucial moment in the space race. But what if the Soviet Union had gotten there first? This is the premise of ""For All Mankind"". The Apple+ series starts with the USSR reaching Earth's satellite before the US does, causing an entirely different series of events. The series manages to be fun every step of the way, while also finding time to be tense, tragic, and other things. It's a fun look at how that one difference might have completely changed history (whether for better or for worse). You're bound to have a lot of fun watching it!",/review/rw8551660/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,glumski,8," Realistic alternate history Sci-Fi with too much soap opera
","(At the time I'm writing this, three seasons have aired and a fourth one is confirmed.)
As an enthusiast for space flight, For All Mankind is an obvious fit for me. The first season with its far-extended Space Race, with Wernher von Braun, the Saturn V, and the Apollo program, was very special to see. Admittedly, it took the series a few episodes to properly take off, but when it finally did, it delivered fantastic characters, an interestig plot, a furious finale, and -- most of all -- perfectly legitimate and realistic depictions of space flight.",/review/rw8551660/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,ve87be,9," Damn! I did not expected it to be amazing!
","It starts okey, a bit of an alternative universe likish but the show develops more and more into its own reality. Yyou start enjoying it for what it is, the characters and scenarios. Some episodes were incredibly thrilling, kept you glued to the screen and some episodes have been let's say more for the character development.",/review/rw8551660/?ref_=tt_urv

28 September 2022,jfarel,8," Good but could have been better
",I especially like the first two seasons which I think culminated with a fantastic disaster episode early in season 3. I just find the 1990s to be less interesting overall and the Ellen story has not worked for me. There's Just too much focus on Ellen's sexuality and the idea of her marriage too an opposite sex gay man is non sensical.,/review/rw8551660/?ref_=tt_urv

","This show hits all the indicators of a great TV show. It's terribly underestimated, and it was a gem I stumbled on by accident.",/review/rw8551660/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2019,johan-magnuseriksson-185-97383,9," This is not a documentary
","I've seen a lot of comments about it not being historically correct. They should look up the meaning of drama. ;). It's a thought experiment, and an interesting one at that.",/review/rw8551660/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,jsimon050-194-194987,10," Yowsa!
","What a show! The creators put their kneecaps in this one! This show was recommended to me by a person 40 years my junior, and we both dug it tremendously. History and fantasy were synthesized into believable reality. I was easily willing to forgive certain gravitational inaccuracies and poor wig technology because the show did not abuse my arrogantly curated disbelief with futuristic sci-fi nonsense. In the words of the James Eugene Carey character in the comedy vehicle Dumb and Dumber, ""I like it a lot!"" And the ending? Forget about it! While profit motive may suggest a fourth season, I think that story-telling and the resistance to happy conclusion strongly support leaving it where it is.",/review/rw8551660/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2021,northernpaladin,7," Space soap opera
","The first season starts slow but by the 3rd episode it gets into its stride and really grabs hold of the alternative history idea and goes with it. Good characters, good story arcs and good balance between space/the moon, launch control and home. Well worth the watch.",/review/rw8551660/?ref_=tt_urv

15 June 2022,arc-67711,6," Ups and downs
","1st season was awesome.. Suspense, action, space and humor.. 2nd season became an Earthbound family/race/lgbtq driven soap opera.. It had it's moments toward the end of the season but overall it was a letdown....",/review/rw8551660/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2022,Tweetienator,4," Too Soapish
","Sometimes we get some good scenes and ideas but for my taste For All Mankind is dragged down by a far too big share of a thing called soap opera. Well, that's nothing unusual these days but for myself it killed the show.",/review/rw8551660/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,catschasemice9594,3," Too much soap not enough science
","I tried. The plot depends heavily on alternative history and soap opera characters. I need a bigger dose of astrophysics and engineering to bring me joy. Some of The most exciting times in my life have been from NASA. Yah, the moon. But Hubble, James West and so many beautiful space lab moments have happened in the past sixty years. I'm gonna go set up my telescope and get some real drama.",/review/rw8551660/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2019,DarthWalker-34381,10," Very watchable
","While the moon landing and NASA has been dramatized many times in film and Television, this show does something none have ever done. It shows us an alternate reality...a ""what if""...from the perspective of writer and creator Ron Moore. Ron Moore brought us the reimagined Battlestar Galatica, and does not disappoint with ""For All Mankind."" Supported by a brilliant cast and great writing, the character and story development gets better and better with each episode.",/review/rw8551660/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,cc0077,10," SO SO GOOD
","It's really rare to watch a show where they truly show the characters maturing as years pass, but For All Mankind does it perfectly. The storyline, acting, characters, just everything is so perfect I'm really looking forward to season 4.",/review/rw8551660/?ref_=tt_urv

3 August 2022,jp-206,4," Season Three suffers. A lot.
","Season one was fantastic, season two was not as good but not awful, season three is a mess. It appears that season three was either written by a poorly coded AI script generator or by a committee of millennials that all needed to cram their two cents into this script. There's way too much soap opera screen time. Poorly conceived ""issues"" are crammed into the storyline without much sense. People are just randomly barking out their sexual orientation on television without much else happening and apparently the astronauts in this alt timeline aren't very bright. Four stars for an average across all three seasons, before that I would have given it 7 or 8.",/review/rw8551660/?ref_=tt_urv
