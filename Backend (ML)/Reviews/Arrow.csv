","Hands of Stone is a rise, fall and rise again story of famed Panamanian boxer Roberto Duran (Ramirez) who leapt into notoriety in the 70's after his first controversial appearance at Madison Square Gardens. By the time of his retirement in 2002 at the age of 50, he had 199 fights under his belt with 103 wins and four titles as a light weight, welter weight, light middle weight and middle weight. The film however focuses on his relationship with legendary boxing trainer Ray Arcel (De Niro) whose own exploits in the boxing world made him the first trainer to be inducted into the Boxing Hall of Fame.",/review/rw3531886/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Hands of Stone"" (2016 release; 195 min.) is a bio-pic about Panama boxing legend Roberto Duran. as the movie opens, it is""Madison Square Garden, 1971"" and we dive straight into a Duran fight, while Ray Arcel (played by Robert de Niro) is checking it out. As Duran makes quick work of his opponent, Arcel's voice over comments ""In 66 seconds, Duran changed my life"". Arcel is convinced by Duran's manager to train him, to make him the next world champion. We then go to ""US Canal Zone, January 9, 1964"", as we see little Roberto participate in the social protests surrounding the Panama Canal. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw3531886/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2016,sinnerofcinema,8," A visit in time through boxing
","Hands of Stone is a pleasant surprise for those willing to regress in time to experience the heights of boxing. Way before internet, there was a time and a place when events like boxing happened, specially when Roberto Duran fought, Panama would come to a stand still. Everyone was tuned into their television for the occasion. When he won, you would hear the country erupt in glee of victory with people sounding their pots & pans. The film showcases those days in an adequate manner. Yes there is the usual clichés happening, but the film's energy transcends those usual predictable story plot point to keep you engage enough to care for the characters. The time capsule through the production design and soundtrack made this film a delight to watch. There is a vast array of subliminal messages from the director, Well come to think of it, its not so subliminal as you see in the ring corners advertising to ""Invest in Venezuela"". Im sure this obvious product placement was a plea by the director and/or the Venezuelan team working on the film for the audience to take notice of the current situation Venezuelans are living. This strategy has been duly noted. The international cast serves the film well and brings the essence of Duran journey to life. Ruben Blades vintage soundtracks adds an unequal energy to the scenes boosting the film above your usual boxing flick. Hands of Stone is better served watching it on the big screen to truly appreciate the scope of the film.",/review/rw3531886/?ref_=tt_urv

31 August 2016,ccorral419,9," Get into the ring with this elevated boxing film
","Caracas, Venezuela, born Director/Writer/Producer Jonathan Jakubowicz (Secuestro express - 2005), along with producing wife Claudine (Epicentral Studios) leap from the Latin film arena to tell the true story of the raise/fall and raise again of showy Panamanian boxer Roberto Duran, portrayed by the outstanding Edgar Ramirez (Zero Dark Thirty). With childhood sweetheart Felicidad (Ana de Armas - War Dogs) by his side, Duran (known as ""Manos de Piedra"" Hands of Stone) claims the WBC welterweight title in 1980 over state-side favorite Sugar Ray Leonard (well portrayed by the at times too pretty Usher - The Voice), only to later utter the words ""No mas"" (no more), walking away from a rematch. Superbly guiding Duran through his life/career is training great Ray Arcel (the always terrific Robert De Niro), money man Carlos (Ruben Blades - Safe House) and childhood funny man Chaplain (Oscar Jaenada - Cantinflas). While several side stories are briefly presented, they help Jakubowicz elevate the film from just a boxing movie. Music by Angelo Mili, cinematography (Miguel Loann Litton Menz), costumes (Bina Daigeler) and set decoration by Denise Camargo and Amy Williams (especially the Disco scene) bring the film to life. Reg E. Cathey (Don King) and the younger Duran (David Arosemena) have nice smaller roles, as does one of my all time favorites Ellen Barkin (Animal Kingdom) as Ray's wife.

","Roberto Duran's (Edgar Ramirez) story goes beyond his rise, fall and comeback to the ring. Its shaped by the political turmoil in Panama during the 70's and the early 80's so when he confronts Sugar Ray Leonard (Usher), his stakes are as high as to carry along his nation's pride with him. His trainer Ray Arcel (DeNiro), shapes him from a bully in search for revenge, into a Champion who's at his best after he realizes dignity is much more than just winning the belt. Many have won fights but few fighters have won the respect of their foes as did Duran and Sugar Ray back in the days.

19 May 2017,meeza,8," Don't need to be stoned to enjoy this one!
","You have been warned. There will be plenty of pun jabs in this review, but please don't count me out yet. Roberto Duran, the legendary Panamanian boxer, is in the center ring in Writer-Director Jonathan Jakobuwicz' bio pic ""Hands of Stone"". Jakobuwicz features Duran Duran, and more of Duran; I just did that so I could include one of my favorite bands of all time in this review. Anyways, Edgar Ramirez stars as Duran in a bit over-the-top performance but still had a few uppercuts in his work. The film features Duran as a child living in the Panamanian slums, and then as a young man who loved the boxing game, next his eventual rise into the ring, and lastly his legendary battles with boxing champion Sugar Ray Leonard. Jakobuwicz also presents Duran's personal life in his relationship with his girlfriend and then wife Felicidad. But this movie is very much also about Duran's seasoned trainer Ray Arcel, who is played with plenty of punch by the great Robert DeNiro. Arcel had a wealth of experience training champion boxers, but ran into a mob squad that physically & mentally forced him out of boxing. Years later, Arcel discovers Duran, and thought it was time to get back in. There is no doubt that Jakobuwicz does get a bit showy in several of the film's scenes; but you know what, I found them to be in the ropes of ""guilty pleasure"" watching. DeNiro, who needs no training in the thespian world, was brilliant as Arcel. I also enjoyed the first card supporting work from John Turturro as a mobster, Ruben Blades as Duran's manager, and Usher (yes, that Usher) as Sugar Ray Leonard. Sure, there lots of cheesy stuff in ""Hands of Stone"" that have a familiar ring to it, and yes I do think many will be sparring partners of mine by disagreeing with me on that it was an entertaining bio flick; but I don't see why you should not go head to head and eye to eye with ""Hands of Stone"". **** Good",/review/rw3531886/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2016,Ed-Shullivan,9," Roberto Duran and Ray Arcel were good for boxing and even better for the historians
","I love boxing films and even more so when the film is based on a true story in which the director portrays the sports hero(s) experiencing every day peoples' lows and highs that we should be able to relate to. Within the first 15 minutes of the film I was captivated with Roberto Duran, the child, the man, and ultimately the boxer with unlimited talent and an insatiable hunger to win a boxing world championship.",/review/rw3531886/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2017,Neil-M09,7," Better than Metacritic says, very accurate to the IMDb score...
","For a biographical movie is good, mainly because, unlike to others in this genre, the actors speaks in the languages of the real people they portraits. But for a boxing movie, at times fails with the romantic drama scenes but mainly for the over egocentric personality of the main character, Roberto Durán. Also the script doesn't show the public enough matches. The highlights of the film, obviously, is Edgar Ramirez performance, but in my opinion, gives me a mixed perspective...in one hand, a confident and charismatic Durán, in the other hand, sadly, a man who blames his father for leaving his family and uses that as an excuse for his hate to U.S.A. is kinda annoying, also he thinks he's unstoppable even with his coach, Ray Arcel, played by Robert de Niro. Despite all this, the simple script is saved by some aspects. One is the costume design, because the movie occurs in many years, and the clothes tells us the time In which the characters live. The good technical aspects, like photography, sound mixing and editing, and film editing too, gives the film a better look. In overall, this movie is better enjoyed if you seek a mix between sports, drama and romance but not at its best.",/review/rw3531886/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2016,wepollock-682-575986,10," Great movie with focus
","Boxing provides cover for a character study of several interesting and intersecting personalities who are motivated by different things, events, culture, and history. Those looking for Rocky, Ali, or an old time boxing flick might be disappointed with the lack of drama. However, it can be more interesting to know why people are doing things rather than how they are doing them. Detracting from the film was the directors use of soft focus most of which frankly was out of focus, literally out of focus. I don't know why anyone would shoot an entire movie with close-ups that are slightly out of focus. Nevertheless the dialogue the story the characters and their motivations were conveyed with interest and clarity. Give me a movie with ""too many words ""any day as opposed to movies with special-effects in a linear plots. This movie provides us with the study of real life, and real people flaws and all.",/review/rw3531886/?ref_=tt_urv

","As a kid I would watch boxing matches with my grandfather. I remember asking him; ""Do they ever just quit?"" He went on to tell me the story of a man this film is based on. Hands Of Stone chronicles the chaotic life and career of former Panamanian boxer Roberto Duran, as seen through the eyes of his trainer. While it is visually similar to most boxing movies, it's about real people who lived very real lives, that happen to revolve around boxing. At times it plays like a documentary. Taking the viewer on an emotional roller coaster ride with it. There is limited time for character development. The cuts are quick and the story moves right along, much like the rounds of a boxing match.",/review/rw3531886/?ref_=tt_urv

","In 1971, manager Carlos Eleta (Rubén Blades) introduces his fighter Roberto Durán (Edgar Ramírez) to legendary trainer Ray Arcel (Robert De Niro). The anti-American Durán rejects Arcel at first. He grew up hating America over the Panama canal and being abandoned by his American soldier father. Plomo is his street level trainer and Chaflan is his outlandish friend. He chases after beautiful Felicidad Iglesias (Ana de Armas) and marries her. Arcel had been forced to retire by mobster Frankie Carbo (John Turturro) and is longtime married to Stephanie (Ellen Barkin). Durán's nemesis becomes American darling Sugar Ray Leonard (Usher Raymond). He gets Sugar Ray by insulting his wife Juanita (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) before the first fight.

","""Hands of Stone"" is a pretty average biopic/boxing movie. It tells the story of Duran's life, skimping on quite a few details, and throws in de Niro as legendary trainer Ray Arcel to sweeten the deal, and a miscast Usher (the R&B star) as Sugar Ray Leonard.",/review/rw3531886/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2017,nogodnomasters,8," No Mas
","This is a biopic of Roberto Durán (Edgar Ramírez). It shows Durán in Panama as a child and incorporates the background of US/Panama relations. As an adult the film concentrates on his relationship with Jewish trainer Ray Arcel (Robert De Niro) who acts more like a life coach, whispering the fight strategy into Durán's ear right before the bout. How about ""The Boxer Whisperer"" for a title? It is a bit like the ""Rocky"" series as we see Durán rise up hungry from the streets and winning in a close decision. He then goes on a winner's binge and parties too much, only to lose to Sugar Ray Leonard (Usher Raymond). Durán regains the ""Eye of the Tiger"" by fighting in a prison. I guess there are only so many variations a boxer's life we can actually have. At least they spared us the training music montage. The film implies Roberto Durán's trash talking was a strategy to get inside another fighter's head.",/review/rw3531886/?ref_=tt_urv

","That's one of the best boxing movies made since several décades, since RAGING BUILL actually. At least for my taste. Performances are awesome and characters depiction too. But there is a scene I don't understand. After Duran shouted after his guests around his swimming pool, you see one of these guests in a street restaurant, grabbing some fodd from a tourist plate, run away and then being hit by a car whilst he escapes...
 Why this scene? Which link with the story? This character was no more than a simple extra...

","While this is essentially a boxing film it's also a decent biopic covering Roberto Durán's life from his childhood growing up in poverty in Panama through his boxing career and rise to wealth and fame. It, while superficially, also touches on the Panama–United States relations from the 1960's onward and their effects on Durán's attitude to life and the United states.",/review/rw3531886/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie reminds me of the Venezuelan telenovelas I used to watch as a child.(Venezuelan telenovelas were world renown, They used to be transmitted here in the U.S., before Hugo Chavez shut down RCTV!) How the film makers were able to jam pack an entire ""telenovela"" into an hour and a half is amazing! I won't ruin the movie for you, but this movie has everything! Love! Abandonment! Eating disorders! Language barriers! Learning disabilities. Social inequality! Racial issues! Organized crime! Politics! A little bit of boxing! But, mostly love and music. Lots of music.

21 November 2016,cosmo_tiger,7," A great movie that is worth seeing because the story is full of everything a movie should have
","""In 66 seconds Roberto Durand changed my life."" Ray Arcel (De Niro) was one of the best boxing managers in history until he crossed the mob. He promised to step away from the game, but then he met Roberto Durand (Edgar Ramírez). Both lives, and the sport of boxing is changed forever and the only person that can stop Durand's rise is himself. I was looking forward to watching this movie since I am a huge sports movie fan and it had De Niro in it. First of all this was a very very good movie that had great drama and great acting. The fact that this is a true story made this even better and I do recommend this movie. That being said, I watched the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary about this subject a few years ago, and to me that was better than this. That being said, the movie is still very good and if you haven't seen the documentary you will love this, as for me I really really liked it. I think my problem was that the movie stayed so true to the actual story, even the fights are shot for shot how they actually happened, that it didn't really add anything that I hadn't known already. Overall, a great movie that is worth seeing because the story is full of everything a movie should have. The documentary, however, was better and it hurt the movie for me a little bit. I give this a B.",/review/rw3531886/?ref_=tt_urv

","By the last half an hour mark of Hands of Stone, I was thinking about my grocery list. By the last ten minutes, I was checking my watch to see how much longer it would be until I could use the restroom. As I watched this movie, I was sure of what the film was going for. It was trying to be a typical inspirational sports movie about the little guy who starts out with a big ego and nothing but the clothes on his back who becomes somebody that the kiddies can look up to. What I was unsure of was how the film chose to get there. This is the cinematic equivalent of a Pinball game. Story starts here, goes over there for a few seconds, shoots to the top for a second, falls down to the bottom in a flash, while there is little aim or consistency in the game-play.",/review/rw3531886/?ref_=tt_urv

","In 1971, Roberto Duran (Edgar Ramirez) fights at Madison Square Garden - an incredible accomplishment at a notable venue, considering Duran's humble origins. The eventual lightweight champion's story is narrated by his legendary trainer, Ray Arcel (Robert De Niro), a man who helped thousands of boxers master the sport, and who now must teach the kid strategy and discipline to become a true winner. And taking into account De Niro's own expertise with boxing movies, it's difficult not to trust everything he says about the up-and-comer.
