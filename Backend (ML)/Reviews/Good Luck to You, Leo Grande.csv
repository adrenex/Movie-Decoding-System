","In this second part of the Wedding Veil trilogy, Emma (Autumn Reeser) travels to Italy to teach an art class and she meets Paolo (Paolo Bernardini), whose family makes lace products. They set out to uncover the story behind the wedding veil that Emma and her friends purchased in the U. S.",/review/rw7865799/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2022,rhonnie-43139,6," It was ok
",I found it less enjoyable than the first one. I just didn't care much for the plot. I usually like the lead actress in other movies. It was just boring to me. It seemed too long. There was only conflict at the very end of the movie and the way it was resolved was silly.,/review/rw7865799/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2022,LtlHippo,9," Enjoyable
",Enjoyed this one more than the first in the trilogy. The guy in the first one was so clueless. Not a huge fan of Lacey. Loved all the characters in Unveiled. Everyone had great chemistry. The storyline was nice. Wish we would know the value of the veil. Looking forward to #3. Wish Hallmark would do more trilogies.,/review/rw7865799/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2022,cgvsluis,8," Beautiful Italian interlude filled with lace and romance.
",This is the second film in Hallmark's Love-u-ary The Wedding Veil trilogy and is about the second of three college friends who purchase a veil together in San Francisco at an antique shop. The veil has a legacy of love and it is said that whoever has the veil will find true love.,/review/rw7865799/?ref_=tt_urv

","In part two of the trilogy, The Wedding Veil Unveiled, Autumn Reeser is going to Italy to teach an Art History class for a month or two. She is taking the veil with her to confirm that it is the same veil in the portrait, and if so, to learn the history behind it. For one thing, how did it get to San Francisco? First of all, if I were Lacey Chabert or Alison Sweeney I would be royally p.o.ed that Autumn Reeser got to go to Italy for her part of the trilogy, and I didn't. The beautifully photographed scenes in that country were one of the best parts of this one. While Autumn and her love interest are investigating the story behind the veil worn in the portrait by the fictional artist Amici we vicariously explore some beautiful destinations including Venice, Verona, Burano, and Padua. No Rome, and I didn't miss it at all.",/review/rw7865799/?ref_=tt_urv

14 February 2022,cberry610,9," Best Hallmark movie in a long time!
","The first instalment in the series left so much to be desired (between lack of chemistry, a slow, boring plot and a male lead so absolutely clueless it was hard to understand how he dressed himself in the morning...) so I was hesitant to watch the sequel. I'm a huge fan of Autumn Reeser and am also Italian living in Italy so I wanted to see what this movie had to offer.",/review/rw7865799/?ref_=tt_urv

","This was such a sweet, romantic, and touching story of love, both past and present. Autumn, (one of my favourites) was perfect in this role. And Paolo was the icing on a wonderful Italian cake. The scenery of Italy and especially of Venice was just lovely to see and brought a few tears to my eyes. The Italian side of my family came from just north of this area. I wish I could have had one more trip back, but this movie helped transport me to this place in my heart. The story of the veil and all of it's history added to this beautiful movie.",/review/rw7865799/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2022,beth628,10," Great Movie
","I usually watch Hallmark's mysteries and occasionally watch their romances. I liked the first installment of this trilogy, but I liked the added mystery of the history of the veil in this second installment. It was like a mystery and romance rolled into one.",/review/rw7865799/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2022,alar62,10," Hallmark transported me back to Venice
",This movie truely captured the feel of Venice and the surrounding area. I enjoyed the storyline about the mystery of the veil and the chemistry between the leading actors and cast. Paolo Bernardini was amazing.,/review/rw7865799/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2022,hallmarkmov,9," Great sequel
","There was a lot going on in this movie! I loved Italy, I love the leads, the side characters, and the story was such a mystery! Had no idea how it was going to end. I had guessed the student would play a larger role but seems he was a way to tie the first movie to this one. It was a beautifully shot movie and lovely story. There may have been too many b storylines that took away from the main story. I thought the first one was simpler and you could enjoy it at a slow pace. This one was a bit quick with so much going on. But I still loved it. Watched it twice already!",/review/rw7865799/?ref_=tt_urv

",I loved this 2nd film in the The Wedding Veil series. It's such a refreshing change to the usual Hallmark films & loved the history behind the veil. The locations are absolutely stunning - Italy is my favourite European country. Autumn Reeser is one of my favourite Hallmark actors & there was chemistry between her & Paolo. Whoever choose Autumn's wardrobe had impeccable taste. I can't wait for my Wedding Veil Legacy DVD to arrive from the US.,/review/rw7865799/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2022,bkorbin,10," Wonderful, love story line. Looking forward to #3 Who wrote these???
","Good actor chemistry, beautiful cinematography. Felt like I was there AGAIN. I left a note! Wish it were more than a trilogy...a series would have been just fine with me. Very sensitive writing, historically accurate.",/review/rw7865799/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2022,teebear817,1," OMG... IT'S BRUTAL!!!!!!!
","Straight men, do not watch this. You will want to jump off a bridge in 30 minutes. It is 100% a chick flick. It's about one of the 3 women.... 1. The skinny brunette. Set in Italy. It's all about one person, Lacey and Alison are only seen on the phone here and there. So much Italian is spoken you will scream, then when it's a English, the Italian accents are strong and irritating. Awful, just awful, trust me. I was forced to watch this cause my wife liked it. Brutal!!!!",/review/rw7865799/?ref_=tt_urv

","5/10 - usually I am not a big fan of the Hallmark dramas where they go abroad, but Autumn Reeser did fairly well with this one but it still felt a little too gimicky and not worth the talent of the 3 ladies involved.",/review/rw7865799/?ref_=tt_urv

",Hallmark needs to get some new writers. Seriously the plots of their movies are all the same. The Wedding Veil has to be the most stupidest movies of all. They are not even engaged but buy a wedding veil. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,/review/rw7865799/?ref_=tt_urv
