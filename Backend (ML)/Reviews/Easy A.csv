26 November 2010,KnightsofNi11,7," A very funny comedy with slightly skewed morals
","It's always nice to see a comedy that doesn't meander around the same stupid gags insulting my intelligence time and time again. I was very happy to see a different kind of teen comedy that was much more sophisticated than the films it branches from and even parodies in many creative ways. Easy A is about a typical high school girl named Olive (Emma Stone). Olive has never been popular and has never really been noticed by anyone, and I don't see why considering Emma Stone is absolutely beautiful but that's beside the point. Anyway, Olive, without thinking things through, starts a little white lie about losing her virginity. This lie spreads to the rumor mill and spreads throughout the whole school ridiculously fast, which is one of the bigger themes of this movie that focuses on a lot of the necessary flaws of high school, one of the most incessantly emotional periods of our lives. Obviously, the rumor quickly gets out of hand and Olive's reputation as the school slut grows. Instead of backing down here, Olive exploits the rumor mill for her own social and financial gain, as guys pay her to pretend to have sex with her. The themes and criticisms of high school life in this film are valid, but thankfully they aren't overbearing and the entire movie becomes a laugh out loud blast.",/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2010,Movie_Muse_Reviews,8," Fun, hip and goofy modern comedy and '80s comedy homage
","Through much of the beginning of ""Easy A,"" you have to find all the '80s teen comedy homages fishy. Maybe director Will Gluck and Burt V. Royal are trying to dress up a classic Hughesian formula with modern banter and social media references. Then, somewhere near the halfway point, comes the admission. Olive, played by up-and-comer Emma Stone, confesses she wants her life to have a ""Sixteen Candles"" or ""Breakfast Club"" or ""Say Anything"" moment. Ah, and suddenly this is homage territory -- much better. Like the rest of this hip, fun and surprisingly touching comedy, any time ""Easy A"" wanders down the path of cliché, a killer line or great scene nullifies it. ",/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2011,TheLittleSongbird,8," A very easy film to like
","What drew me to this film were the cast, on paper this was a great cast capable of great performances. And that's exactly the case watching Easy A. While there is nothing groundbreaking and while the cast drew me in initially the concept was a kind that was kind of interesting but could've gone either way.",/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2010,Stampsfightclub,9," Star of the future Stone shines in very funny comedy
","Emma Stone stars as Olive, a lonely heart who lies about losing her virginity to her best friend and soon rumour spreads she is a slut. Initially mortified Olive parades around the school as a slut, wearing an 'A' on her clothing but soon she ends up in trouble.",/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2011,claudio_carvalho,7," I Loved this Film and Emma Stone
","In California, the virgin student Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) feels anonymous in the high school where she studies. When her best friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka) invites her to spend the weekend with her family, Olive lies and tells that she will have a date with a nonexistent community college student. On the next Monday, Rhiannon goes to the bathroom with Olive and asks how her encounter was and Olive lies, telling that she lost her virginity in the weekend with her fictitious boyfriend. However, one school mate overhears their conversation and spreads the rumor about Olive's promiscuity. The religious fanatic Marianne (Amanda Bynes) blames her and out of the blue. Olive becomes a notorious student. ",/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2010,wkup,9," Easy A is Easy to Love....
","Lately the genre of teen comedies skew to the ribald and the are more sex romps than tell stories and introduce characters that you can not only root for but like. ""Easy A"" is a welcomed throwback to earlier teen comedies: risqué, but heartfelt.",/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2010,ferguson-6,7," The Inexactitude of High School
","Greetings again from the darkness. This is an obvious (and proud of it) homage to the great teen films of John Hughes. It is updated for this generation of teens - replete with FaceBook, texting and webcam. While this one may not have the fully realized characters of the Hughes films, it actually takes things a step further in its commentary on many topics: family life, parenting, religious zealotry, rumor-mongering and the public education system.",/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2019,nogodnomasters,10," starsEMMA STONE WAS GREAT
","Emma Stone has been typecast as a nerdy high school/ college girl. If you have seen her in other movies, her character is the same in this one. Needless to say, she does it very well, so well in fact when she attempts to act sexy, it doesn't work, perhaps a sign that they had Lindsey Lohan in mind for the part. Emma doesn't want to go camping with her BFF's family so she lied about what she is doing that weekend and later lies that she had sex. (I loved the birthday card from the grandparents with $5.00 in it.) This falsehood is spread around school. Later a guy who is gay asks Emma to say she had sex with him so the kids won't pick on him. At a party, she pretends to have sex with him while nearly the entire student body is outside the door listening. Emma is shocked she now has the reputation as a ""skank."" This is a weak plot point that Ms. Stone makes real for us, as well as pretending to have sex for money with half the school. There is of course the Christian crowd who are more loud and obnoxious than in real life (I think), and Lisa Kudrow who did a lousy job as a guidance counselor, or maybe she wasn't good enough to save a plot with so many cartoon characters and plot implausibilities. The movie was laugh out loud funny and that was only because we did watch all those 80's movies. For those who liked this movie, especially the confrontation with the campus Christians, I recommend the movie ""Saved."" Growing up in the 60's we wanted girls who had sex in our school and didn't attempt to get them expelled. Is California really that ""uncool"" now?",/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2010,jon.h.ochiai,10," ""A"" is for Awesome
","According to Emma Stone's Olive, ""A is for Awesome."" ""Easy A"" is the funny smart movie of the year. Director Will Gluck's fresh mashing of Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter"" in this Twitter Age is whimsical, genuine, and hysterical. Emma Stone is absolutely amazing. Writer Bert V. Royal's screenplay brilliantly captures the angst and social perils of kids of this Facebook generation. Royal completes his story with touching narrative arcs and twists, and a valiant hero in Emma Stone. ""Easy A"" is reminiscent of ""Juno"" in its clever and biting dialog. Where in ""Juno"" no one in real life actually speaks with those razor-like smarts, ""Easy A"" is witty and sharp in natural speak.",/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2019,UniqueParticle,10," I love this movie so much!
",Very good morals involved; this is the type of rom-com that truly warms your heart in the best way possible. It inspires me & makes me miss social interactions/high school even though it was rough for me at times.,/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2010,kurt_kennett,8," Excellent Tribute to John Hughes
","Just saw this with my daughter who is 13. She has just recently seen all the John Hughes 80's movies (Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, etc.) and said it felt just like one of them. I couldn't agree more - great direction and just a hint of a wacky feel to it. Realistic, fun and interesting *normal* parents that don't take the world too seriously and want to be there for their kid.",/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2020,rooprect,8," The smartest high school teen comedy I've ever seen.
","There's a rare comedy zone that exists above pratfalls & cheap gags, above situational laughs, somewhere near satire but not quite that obvious. It's a peculiar zone, sort of like the classic ""Edward Scissorhands"" where the filmmakers are clearly showing you an exaggerated reality, but not so exaggerated that you lose touch with its relevance. And through this wacky prism we see our own lives with a hilarious spin if the actors can pull off the right deadpan delivery. Very few movies hit this zone, movies like ""Catch-22"" (1970), ""Dr Strangelove"" (1964), ""Joe Vs. the Volcano"" (1990) or ""Punch Drunk Love"" (2002). And here, I'm happy to announce in the most unlikely genre (high school teen comedy) we have a great addition to the list: ""Easy A"".",/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2011,planktonrules,3," A great premise but the writing really disappoints...
","Although the film begins with some great opening credits and had a great idea for a plot, the rest of the film really, really disappoints due to bad (VERY bad) writing. So, they took a very good idea and made the least of it.",/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2010,george.schmidt,8," Stone shines in this funny teenage comedy with echoes of John Hughes
","EASY A (2010) *** Emma Stone, Penn Badgley, Amanda Bynes, Dan Byrd, Thomas Haden Church, Patricia Clarkson, Stanley Tucci, Cam Gigandet, Lisa Kudrow, Malcolm McDowell, Alyson Michalka, Fred Armisen. Stone shines as a teenager facing a scandalous rumor – of being a harlot – that only snowballs when she cannot control and instead embraces the innuendo to largely comic affect echoing some John Hughes and of course ""The Scarlett Letter"". Director Will Glick ably gets a lot of mileage from virginity jokes and the like from the fairly smart and funny script by Bert V. Royal but gets more mileage from his even brighter supporting cast particularly the always welcome Clarkson & Tucci as the acridly humorous (and highly, capably understanding) parents. Stone's star is on the rise and she also rises above what would have been another ordinary teen farce but her trademark pluck and smoky voice add panache to what could have been a lackluster role. A nice surprise for a change in a genre that needs fresh blood!",/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2010,Smells_Like_Cheese,8," Easy to love
","Being a teenage girl is no easy task, believe me. In Jr. High I had a boyfriend and the first thing on young teenage minds is the curiosity if there is sex in the relationship, fun rumors began to spread and it was one of the worst times in my life. Funny enough, this isn't something that just started when I was a child, or my older sister or my mother or my grandmother. Girl's reputations have always been fragile since the beginning of time, even Shakespeare knew when he wrote Much Ado About Nothing. The Scarlet Letter challenged the double edged sword of how if a man sleeps with a woman, he's a pimp, a lady's man, or just simply ""the Man"". If a woman sleeps with a man, she doesn't get as kind treatment, we get the names ""slut"", ""whore"", or ""tramp"". No matter how much you know it's the truth that you're not those names, it hurts. But what if a girl actually took pride in those names and love the attention she got, even if it was too rough to handle? Emma Stone proving that she's leading lady material handles herself extremely well in this terrific re-imaging of The Scarlet Letter for teenagers that will prove to be more positive and every pre-adult lady should watch.",/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2010,halliebenfer,9," Pleasantly Surprised
","I attended a free preview of this movie and without having done any research on the movie and just based on a short synopsis, had pretty low expectations walking into the cinema. It's always great coming out of a cinema being pleasantly surprised by an enjoyable movie and that's exactly what happened! I've always been a fan of fast witty dialogue and this movie definitely delivers! Virtually every character in the movie whether minor or major seems to have something funny to say, and while there wasn't a lot of ROFL moments, there were quite a few LOL's throughout the movie! To me, it's one of those movies perfect for a Friday night to unwind from work without having to use too many brain cells (but enough so that you don't walk out of there thinking you'd wasted your time and intellect!) - it's one of those movies that i'll definitely be purchasing on DVD when it comes out!!",/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2018,cricketbat,5," Loses a lot of steam in the second half
","I'm conflicted about Easy A. The story is interesting, but the plot is uneven. It loses a lot of steam in the second half. Emma Stone is fantastic, as usual, but the rest of the characters are mostly flat and uninteresting. Also, for a movie that portrays a strong ""don't judge"" message, it sure judges Christianity pretty harshly.",/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2014,A_Different_Drummer,10," once in a lifetime casting ...
","... makes for a once in a lifetime film. Forget all that stuff about bringing the Scarlet Letter into modern times. It's noise. Pay attention to the fact that, despite the major success of this film, Emma Stone (who was technically in her 20s when this was filmed and therefore ""playing younger"") has no aspirations to become a teen idol nor get her own Disney show. What makes this film special -- aside from a script to die for and a superb portrayal by Stone, showing no strain whatsoever under the burden of dual duty, that is, both acting and doing a first person narrative, like Bogey in a filme noire -- is the simple fact that Stone will not be reprising this role (or anything similar) in either her lifetime or yours. And that is special. That's makes this film not only a one-of but also one of the best ""smart comedies"" ever, irregardless of age or audience.",/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2010,evan_harvey,5," Okay, but ultimately souless
","Saw Easy A tonight. It's pretty average. It's a film that had multiple references to classic 80's Brat Pack flicks, and so that raises it above the standard teen movies. Older audiences will get the 80s references more than the younger ones. There's quite a few laughs to be had, and some snappy dialogue. The basic idea of the film is good (a re-working of The Scarlett Letter, which the film unashamedly references and possibly over-references).",/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2010,BradInAZ,," Modern day Scarlett Letter as gossip gets out of hand at Ojai High School.
","June 2 2010 - saw advanced preview of ""Easy A"" tonight. Emma Stone plays sarcasm great in this one, and supporting cast works well with her. Emma also narrates heavily throughout, and though not rolling on the floor funny, this has the feel of a John Hughes film (even makes reference to him in a longing way). Thomas Haden Church is funny as the only teacher we really meet, and Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are well cast as the understanding and 60's hippy mentality parents. The crowd I saw it with laughed frequently, and there are a lot of ""I've been there"" or ""I've seen that"" moments that you can relate to from your own high school. The writing is a little bit above the age - that is to say, you'd be surprised to hear the advanced dialog coming from today's teenagers, but this movie worked for me and those with me. Makes for a fun night at the movies. Scheduled for release Sept 17 2010.",/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2010,Floated2,3," Easy A tries too hard to be liked
","Easy is a pretty simple straight forward story with an odd message. The plot is rather awkward and weird but for the most parts is plays out. Right from the start the film reeks a bit of desperation, as if it's trying too hard to be liked, much like many of its characters. Olive's feature-length confession, a 4th-wall breaking running monologue, is an awkward device that never seems sincere, while the turns the plot takes, particularly one involving a counsellor and a student, are simply too much to swallow. The film goes downhill in my opinion, from the part where it gets more religious. The scene with Olive going to church. It seemed like that was meant for the original R rating of the film.",/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2010,saadgkhan,9," Easy A is the Most Smartest Teen movie I've ever Seen...Its Xtremly Witty, Clever, sharp & Out of the Box. Emma Stone Rocked it!
","EASY A – CATCH IT ( A ) Easy A is undoubtedly the best teen movie I've seen in recent times. It's extremely Witty, Clever, sharp & Out of the Box, which regenerate the whole new teenage world for us. Just imagine the teenage life we have seen in Clueless, 10things I hate about you and Mean Girls. Easy A is certainly a major step ahead in the life of vivacious and nowadays teenager's life. Besides the intelligent and brilliant cast, what makes Easy A more effective is its dialogues and storyline. Emma Stone proved that she was meant to do this role; she is witty, charming, funny and incredibly sweet. Emma Stone certainly stole the show and with help of some incredible young and some veterans supporting cast, she rocked it! In the end the musical dance number was a simply sexy & incredible. Penn Badgley is sweet & such a pleasant actor to see on screen. Amanda Bynes did a fine job. Aly Michalka was great, she was so blunt and outspoken, loved it. Dan Bryd is a great comedian, In Cougar Town and now in the movie he proved that this kid can make you laugh Big time. Cam Gigandet is Hot as Always. Now let talks about some veterans supporting cast in t he movie, I think it's the first time such big actors have works have worked in a teenage movie, where they have few scenes. Bravo for Will Gluck for convincing them to do the movie. Stanley Tucci & Patricia Clarkson, Wow Hands down they were great together. I think everyone would love to have parents like that, I wish they make a movie with these characters again some time, they were simply amazing. Lisa Kudrow is funny & mean. Thomas Hayden Church did a good job. Overall Easy A one of the best and intelligent movies of 2010, leave the teenage genre it's for everyone. Enjoy it!",/review/rw2345367/?ref_=tt_urv
