8 April 2019,Sleepin_Dragon,9," Engrossing and dramatic.
","This is a truly gripping, engaging and dramatic film. The first thing anyone will be aware of, is the quality of the production values, it is superbly made, gloriously acted, and meticulously filmed. A very classy production indeed.",/review/rw3829778/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2017,Troy_Campbell,9," A slow burning, provocative gem.
","There has been next to no fanfare for the release of this murder mystery. Which is surprising, considering the talent involved in front of the camera (Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen) and behind it (writer-director Taylor Sheridan). Fresh from joining the ranks of top-tiered screenwriters after the amazing one-two punch of Sicario and Hell or High Water, Sheridan continues his stellar run with a heart-wrenching study of loss and grief wrapped in a taut crime thriller narrative. Also having a crack at directing, Sheridan allows the snowy Wyoming setting to completely envelope the characters in a world that feels like it has no exits, both physically and emotionally. When this Native American community is hit with a homicide it feels like another tragedy in a long line of tragedies; their shock is replaced with deeper sorrow, their outrage is replaced with solemn defeat. Entering the scene like a fish out of water, Olsen's junior FBI agent Jane Banner must traverse the tricky cultural complexities if she's to understand the clues in front of her. Luckily she has Renner's local hunter Cory Lambert to assist, himself battling with a past family disaster. Renner and Olsen are both in terrific form, the former hiding his grief under a stoic veneer, the latter balancing big-city attitude with a genuine desire to find justice for the victim. Veteran character actor Gil Birmingham is also superb as a father unsure of how to deal with his earth-shattering loss. If this all sounds a bit heavy, well it is, but Sheridan's careful to inject a healthy dose of suspense and mild action to keep the drama gripping rather than overbearing; the finale in particular turns the movie on its head in an unpredictable but extremely effective manner. An intelligent, slow burning and provocative viewing that enthrals from start to finish, Wind River is an understated gem that deserves an audience.",/review/rw3829778/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2017,Fella_shibby,9," Renner's potrayal of a broken man who is keen on hunting any kinda predators, Sheridan's superb writing, the snowy landscape as another character makes this a must watch.
","I saw this few days back on a Blu-ray. As an avid fan of Taylor Sheridan, was looking forward to this without watching the trailer. It is a very beautifully shot, well acted and distressing crime drama. The vast landscape becomes more than a vivid backdrop, it becomes a character in the film.
Wind River is able to showcase Sheridans directing and storytelling strengths.
From the dark border area (Sicario), to the scorching plains of Texas (Hell or ...) and to the frozen mountains in Wyoming in Wind river, the writer/director managed to make the landscape a character in the film. Jeremy Renner potrayed the role of a broken man who is keen on hunting the predators very well n he deserves an Oscar for his performance. The less said about the plot is better because one has to see this film rather than read about its plot.
The film has a very strong social message.
The films conclusion with the message was very horrifying n distressing.",/review/rw3829778/?ref_=tt_urv

19 August 2017,paul-allaer,8," ""You are looking for clues, but you are missing all the signs""
","""Wind River"" (2017 release; 107 min.) brings the story of Wildlife Officer Cory Lambert. As the movie opens, reminding us ""Inspired By Actual Events"", we briefly see a woman running for her life in the snow. We then are introduced to Lambert, who is hunting down wolves. Lambert visits his ex, where he picks up his young son for the day. Lambert then visits the parents of his ex, as their life stock has been attacked, possibly by a lion. In the course of starting his investigation, Lambert finds the frozen body of the woman we saw running for her life. Because it looks like a possible homicide, an FBI agent is called. At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw3829778/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2017,TheLittleSongbird,9," More than well worth tracking down
","Having been responsible for writing 'Sicario', directed by Denis Villeneuve, and 'Hell or High Water', directed by David McKenzie, Taylor Sheridan's directorial debut 'Wind River' was seen with great interest and high expectations. Mainly to see how Sheridan would fare as a director, showing himself as a great writer for those two mentioned films.",/review/rw3829778/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2017,Ramascreen,10," Suspenseful! A perfect thriller!
","The screenwriter who gave us ""Sicario"" and ""Hell or High Water"" has come back with ""Wind River"" which he also directed and I am now convinced more than ever that Taylor Sheridan is one of the best storytellers of our time. There's something about his thrillers that are just so cunning and sharp and profound, like a great American classic, even novelist Dennis Lehane probably couldn't come up with materials that are as skillfully played as this. And with ""Wind River"" Sheridan's personal artistry mission to do some effort to right the wrongs that the system has committed against the Native Americans, continues.",/review/rw3829778/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2017,ThomasDrufke,8," What a Start For Taylor Sheridan
","Crime dramas have always been one of my favorite genres of filmmaking, especially the ones that take themselves seriously and pose interesting questions about life. Wind River takes the genre up in the cold, snowy tundra of the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. Gritty, brutal, and well-timed action, Wind River builds a simply structured crime film into an important conversation about missing persons with a great storyteller and one great cast.",/review/rw3829778/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2017,Equalizer16,9," Heat to the Cold Sheridan's fantastic crime thrillers work beyond change in weather

3 March 2018,Horst_In_Translation,8," My expectations were high, but they still got exceeded
","Here we have ""Wind River"", a new American movie that finally made it to German theaters too, and this is the most recent work by writer and director Taylor Sheridan, who to me proves that he is right up there with the best as this is certainly one of 2017's finest film achievements. After his success with ""Hell or High Water"", he creates something even better here, even if this one is not getting as much awards attention. But don't be distracted by that, it's an excellent film. It's set in the snowy isolated Indian territories of Wyoming where a young woman is murdered and her brother and his drug-addicted gang members as well as the workers on an oil rig may be connected to said murder. The moment you find out what happened exactly is the very best part of the film in my opinion. And one of the best film scenes in 2017 in general as tragic as it may be. Or because of how tragic it was. And as I am a huge Jeremy Renner fan, that means quite something because these scenes are the only ones he isn't in. He still reminds me a bit of a big screen version of Timothy Oliphant. Anyway, Renner is good here, has some pretty decent material to work with, probably more than Olsen who is more about the contrast between city girl and the region she is forced to work in now. In a bad movie, the case about Renner's character's daughter would have been solved too out of nowhere and the two protagonists would have gotten visibly together as a couple, but luckily Sheridan decided to go for harsh realism instead. Realism that fits the region where this 105-minute movie is set. This is not a winter wonderland. It is bleak and cold surroundings that you really would want to get away from as fast as you can.",/review/rw3829778/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2018,kosmasp,9," Cold as Ice
","Maybe even colder. But one thing is for sure: A slow story telling and one that does not care for a romance between its leads. Other movies might have tried to pair up the two character, but I think this works better this way. There is chemistry don't get me wrong and both play well off each other. But don't expect anything flashy or great happening ... well not the whole time.",/review/rw3829778/?ref_=tt_urv

27 October 2021,classicsoncall,8," ""How do you guage someone's will to live?""
","Jumping right in, one of the things I liked best about this picture was Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) in the uncharacteristic position of an FBI agent who didn't come on like a know-it-all and demanding everyone else follow her lead in the investigation of the rape and murder of Natalie Hanson (Kelsey Asbille). She deferred to Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner), who knew the territory and the locals, and wasn't afraid to ask for his help. At the same time, she showed remarkable courage during the showdown at the trailer between the local authorities and the work crew out at Matt's (Jon Bernthal) trailer. I thought she defined a classic example of a strong, independent woman who wisely put to use the resources she had to effectively do her job.",/review/rw3829778/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2017,PotassiumMan,7," Grim, slow-burn crime thriller marks Sheridan's directorial debut
",Taylor Sheridan's achievement in this film lies in his success in crafting an old school crime drama that doesn't try to re-invent the wheel but instead relies on good old-fashioned storytelling. Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen are both exceptional as a dissimilar pair who out of sheer happenstance form an alliance to solve the mystery of a young woman's brutal death on an Indian reservation. Renner is a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service tracker. Olsen is an FBI agent sent on an assignment very much alone.,/review/rw3829778/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2018,lee_eisenberg,9," a lot will happen in a bleak setting
","Taylor Sheridan's ""Wind River"" is essentially two stories in one. The main plot is the murder investigated by Jeremy Renner's US Fish & Wildlife Service agent and Elizabeth Olsen's FBI agent. Since the murder has taken place on an Indian reservation - the Wind River Reservation referenced in the movie's title - the issue arises of whose responsibility it is to investigate. Renner and Olsen press forward with the investigation, and there's a lot to discover. The other plot is a focus on the status of people living on the reservation. The Indians are a minority in their own land, and are now relegated to dismal, isolated pieces of land with living conditions often comparable to the third world (not to mention high levels of alcoholism). Indeed, one of the movies addressed by the movie is the murders and disappearances of women on the reservations.",/review/rw3829778/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2017,Obi_Bamm_Karaoke,8," Well Directed, Beautifully Shot, And Quality Acting!
","When actors decide they want to make the transition to the other side of the camera and direct films, it can be a dicey proposition. It makes me even more nervous when said actor to director decides they don't have the acting out of their system and want to keep acting, but with ""Wind River,"" Taylor Sheridan (best known for ""Sons of Anarchy,"" but also the writer of both ""Sicario"" and ""Hell or High Water"" with this completing his American Frontier Trilogy) separates himself in order to focus on directing a wonderful based-on-a-true-story tale.",/review/rw3829778/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2017,Jithindurden,9," Emotional, brutal, real and important Wind River is one of the best of the year
","After writing phenomenal scripts of Sicario and Hell or High Water Taylor Sheridan's new directorial venture is as powerful if not better. Sheridan's films follow people and lives of people that are forgotten by the whole world. Even though we are not used to this kind of life the compelling characters feels so real that the negligence of the world over these lives hit you real hard. There isn't a single actor who wasn't completely living as those characters, Sheridan's ability in taking the best out of his actors is amazing. Emotional, brutal, real and important Wind River is one of the best films of the year.",/review/rw3829778/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2017,Jared_Andrews,7," Taylor Sheridan depicts another dilapidated region of America
","If you've seen any of Taylor Sheridan's previous work, you probably noted that he has a certain style. He tells stories about ways of life in dilapidated regions of the country. He blurs the lines between ""good guys"" and ""bad guys,"" instead framing the status of the selected region as the truest villain. What's right and wrong, considering all the unique variables of each story, is not always clear. At least, that was case in Sicario and Hell or High Water. ",/review/rw3829778/?ref_=tt_urv

","WIND RIVER (2017) **** Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen, Graham Greene, Jon Bernthal, Julia Jones, Teo Briones, Kelsey Asbille, Tantoo Cardinal, Gil Brimingham. Well-executed slow burner about a murder on a Native American reservation investigated by a rookie FBI agent (Olsen) and a game tracker (Renner in one of his best roles) who find there is more than meets the eye. Filmmaker Taylor Sheridan (in his directorial debut) delivers a taut, intriguing screenplay as the plot unravels with noir precision and canny supporting roles including Greene as a world-weary police chief and Bernthal as a worker whose introduction is shrewdly conceived.
