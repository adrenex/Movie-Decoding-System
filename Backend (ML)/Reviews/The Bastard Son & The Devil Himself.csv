26 December 2019,maxglen,10," The Most Well Thought Out and Unpredictable Show of All Time.
","This show is genuinely perfect on so many levels. The first season although very reminiscent of Fight Club is still done in such a unique way with unrivalled directing, music and portrayals of genuinely interesting and gripping characters that it sets itself apart from the crowd. Season 2 although seemingly messy and confusing on the surface unravels episode by episode and becomes a much deeper delve into the mindset of Elliot and his alter ego Mr Robot as well as an important part of the overall puzzle presented by the show. Season 3 was at the time of broadcasting my favourite season of television with consistently brilliant instalments every week, including but not limited to Kill Process, Runtime Error, Shutdown and Don't Delete Me. The bold steps taken by season 3 marked a point of no return where they had to go hard or go home with their final season and after a 2 year wait we got what I believe to be the greatest season of television in the history of the media and I don't see that changing anytime soon. Every episode of season 4 is an absolute masterpiece in all respective departments. Mac Quayle delivers another incredible expansion to the score which is one of the staples of Mr Robot and is almost single handedly responsible for its gripping atmosphere, Sam Esmail brings his A game firing on all cylinders in directing and writing giving us shocking and satisfying answers to the questions that need answering and wonderfully frustrating ambiguity to the ones that didn't and the cast are all award worthy, from Rami Malek to Christian Slater, Carly Chaikin to BD Wong, even Joey Bada$$ and Elliot Villar! they all deserve the highest possible praise for their work on this show that they have helped bring to life. Not only is Mr Robot a consistently intriguing and gripping show but it also sticks the landing making its finale its best episode which after Proxy Authentication Required, Kill Process, eXit and Conflict is no small feat. Thank you to all that helped piece together this incredible puzzle and thank YOU for reading this review. I'm going to give Mr Robot a 10/10. Goodbye, friend.",/review/rw6126590/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2019,DrunkenDeGroot,10," Now that it's over, I am confident in giving it a 10.
","Even if you don't like it, Mr. Robot is undeniably a very unique show with lots of great ideas. It's biggest crime to this day is how much it stole from Fight Club, which is now more or less forgiven by everyone.",/review/rw6126590/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2020,aarongnr,10," Most underrated show in history, change my mind
",Over the final 3 episodes I've had my mouth open the entire time. There's nothing that exceeds this. I don't know what to say. Watch this god damn show.,/review/rw6126590/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2019,UniqueParticle,10," Has become my favorite show ever since release
","Everything having to do with going against society and conspiracies I crave! Mr. Robot is incredibly filmed, written, and has such an exciting soundtrack! I absolutely love the vibes I get from all the excellent things that happen throughout. Some of the best suspense ever and profound quotes/speeches. Rami Malek has become one of my favorite actors to watch and I have enjoyed Christian Slater quite a lot. I can't wait till I can own season 4 like I own the other seasons.",/review/rw6126590/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2019,mariamelkott,10," I don't want this to end.
","I was there when the pilot aired. I loved it since day 1. Season 4 is the best!!! Sam Esmail is a genius. Rami , Christian and all of the cast are amazing. This show is going to end with a bang. I bet the finale will be the highest rated one in tv history. And Rami is definitely going to win his Golden Globe this year too!",/review/rw6126590/?ref_=tt_urv

25 November 2020,onelovek,10," Hello Mr. Robot
","Just finish watching the last episode to a brilliant series. This is hands down one of the best tv shows ever! EVER! I thought GOT was it but after they botched the last season of GOT, this is flawless from start to finish. Overall, I can't put into words how amazing the entire staff is. From directing, writing, acting, the entire tv show. Amazing! This has breaking bad and GOT beat by a landslide. Amazing ending to a stupendous series. Thank you for providing this masterpiece.",/review/rw6126590/?ref_=tt_urv

","In my spoiler-free summary of this show, I'm here to express what this show has done to change everything about how I think of serial drama television. I will probably come back to do a follow-up review once the show is finally over because I'm sure this won't do Mr. Robot justice while the main story is still yet to be fully unveiled.",/review/rw6126590/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2020,eskimosound,10," Truly Brilliant!!
","This is the best television series ever created!
The writing is superb, the acting sublime, the camera angles crazy and incredible and the acting stunning.
The direction uses angles you thought wouldn't work, breaking all the filmmakers rules. The cuts are stunning and the sound and soundtrack a real joy. Yep that's right even the cuts are stunning!
The script has you shouting in disbelief and the acting is as real as it gets.
If you haven't seen any of the episodes you have missed the greatest television experience of your life.
Truly brilliant!",/review/rw6126590/?ref_=tt_urv

",How this is show is just 8.5 overall rating when only 2 or 3 epsoides in the 4 seasons are only below 8.5 and more than half epsoides are above 9 someone give me a clue,/review/rw6126590/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2021,cjonesas,9," [9.5] Tailor-made for Rami Malek
","A series with a complex screenplay, multi-layered plots and ultra-brilliant acting by the whole cast, spearheaded by the ruby-like Rami Malek who personified the character's split-paranoiac personality like a glove. A special kudos to the creator and executive producer, Sam Esmail, for his deeply thought-out screenplay, meticulous execution and impressive choice of actors.",/review/rw6126590/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2020,eonzenox,10," Masterpiece
","If you are going to review this show only having watched a couple of episodes or season 1, then your review looks terribly silly for those who completed it.
This is by far one of the most well excecuted series in its decade, this isn't Lost where every unexplainabe thing just fades in a distance. This also isn't Twin Peaks where the bizarre moments will never be explained but encouraged.",/review/rw6126590/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2016,ahmetkozan,8," Watch it if you want your brain to work continuously.
","Mr. Robot is sweeping up all the important awards (Best drama, best actors) and well deserved! When i started to watch this series i didn't expect much, but it has blow me away even in the first episode. A dark story about what is right and what is wrong, and the madness that that question brings. The acting is solid and so is the directing.",/review/rw6126590/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2021,dattaakash-37055,10," The most underrated tv series of all time.
","I saw Mr. Robot and then i re-watched the whole breaking bad, and now i can say with confidence that Mr. Robot is way better than breaking bad. You don't agree? Show me a montage of breaking bad that's better than Mr. Robot. Show me an example of conflict between character in breaking bad that is better than Mr. Robot. Sow me that the cinematography and sound design in breaking bad is better than Mr. Robot. I guess Breaking bad got so much rating just because of the final 3/4 episodes of season 5. I mean that's a lot of emotion there. But who cares. Mr. Robot is better.",/review/rw6126590/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2019,andrewquick-13916,10," The best role by Rami Malek, By far!
","Mr. Robot Staring Rami Malek, Christian Slater, and Portia Doubleday is a work of art.
While telling the story of a hard working, slightly struggling cyber engineer with a hard drug addiction; it also depicts a realistic representation of how ""our democracy has been hacked."" It is also a very realistic life story with quotes like, ""I should just tell her what she wants to hear,"" and, ""We're all living in each other's paranoia."" A must watch for all.
There is no better role of Rami Malek than of Mr. Robot's Elliot Alderson.",/review/rw6126590/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2020,nlgthunder,10," I'm still thinking about it one year after finishing it
","This show was revolutionary. The brilliance of the writing, directing, and the acting is almost unmatched by any other show I've ever watched. It absolutely changed the way I watch other shows. Only a couple others are in the same caliber. Now that it's been a year since I finished it, I'm going to watch it again and I'm confident it'll be better the second time. Kudos to Sam Esmail for making a show that has probably some of the highest rewatch value of all time. Amazing. I cannot praise it enough. Rami as Elliot Alderson is just something I can never put into words. The deeper the show went, the better he got. I'm also forever applauding that they ended the show at four seasons. It was well rounded and genius, without being ran into the ground and ruined like so many other good dramas. Did I mention I loved this show?",/review/rw6126590/?ref_=tt_urv

","Going in with low expectation, not knowing anything about this show, the pilot turned out to offer a pleasant surprise. In short, the show is a bit unconventional, like a mix between an audio book and a TV show, but one rather well researched and executed.",/review/rw6126590/?ref_=tt_urv

","Did USA really just do this? They have managed to give me a combination of the best parts of Swordfish AND Fight Club and managed to make it coherent, suspenseful and a joy to watch.
