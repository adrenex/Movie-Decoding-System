7 January 2023,goshamorrell,9," A thrilling thriller that brings a classic back to life.
","One thing a movie watcher might not be looking for during the actual bleak midwinter is more bleak midwinter on the screen. Full disclosure: ""The Pale Blue Eye,"" written and directed by Scott Cooper and starring his frequent collaborator Christian Bale, set in New York's more-rugged-than-today Hudson Valley in 1830, is thoroughly suffused with bleak mid-winterness. Masanobu Takayanagi's cinematography sometimes reproduces a gorgeous kind of grayscale, broken up by flashes of blue water and the blue uniforms of the cadets of the West Point Military Academy, the then-fledgling institution at which much of the story's action is set. The chilliness fits the story of course. At the Academy, a cadet, named Fry, is discovered not just dead-by hanging, it is first presumed-but with his heart cut out. The extremely spooked overseers of the school, fearful of scandal that might strike a death blow to the place, enlist a retired lawman to investigate. This cadet is one Edgar Allan Poe, a sensitive outcast among militaristic braggarts and of course a future poet himself. This also sets up a challenge for the movie: how to deliver a solution that not only makes sense but also honors the captivating cruelty of the crimes committed. And amazingly, the film's finale is a genuine hoot - totally unexpected yet expertly sold through the clever deployment of information. Unlike a lot of mysteries that are designed to be unsolvable by an audience (which is a valid approach; remember, Arthur Conan Doyle never gave us all the necessary clues, either), The Pale Blue Eye shows us everything we need to figure it all out and still manages to pull the rug out from under us. Even so, what ultimately resonates are the picture's surprisingly moving central relationship and its vivid setting. Ultimately, it's all pretty gripping, not just because of Bale and Melling and the heady atmosphere but because the crimes being investigated are savage on a downright existential level. The murders are monstrous enough to capture the imagination, and Cooper makes sure to prod us along by dwelling on the pasty, swollen corpses; the grotesque, coagulated wounds; the fingers stiff with rigor mortis being cracked on autopsy tables.",/review/rw8794742/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,visionandyouth,7," A true gothic macabre story.
","Reminds me of Tim Burton's The legend of Sleepy Hallow. Its not as dark and scary as Burton's movie , but it is somehow more mature and realistic science wise. Great cinematic appeal , what makes it beautiful is this chilly, gothic lonely and at times frozen in time scenery which is breathtaking in this movie. No fake Green studious or design sets and obvious film stages, its all real nature with rich scenes. Its a A dark mystery that cuts deep, and leaves you empty once you understand the painful ending. Bale did good , getting old with his skills but he delivers. All in all this movie is worth two hours of your time.",/review/rw8794742/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,Drawmort,8," Stop complaining about the length of the movies and enjoy the story!
","The story of a movie is definitely the most important thing in all its factors and elements. If a story is well used, everything will depend on the director to obtain a final product worthy of being remembered outside the year of release. This movie has a wonderful story. It is a period mystery that gives us the participation of a popular real writer as one of the key pieces within the pavilion of fictional characters. Mystery, drama, thriller carried out impeccably by a luxury cast. Christian Bale and Harry Melling are extraordinary. The photography is very well done, taking advantage of the elements of the time portrayed. Excellent setting and visual and special effects.",/review/rw8794742/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2022,tresm87,8," An uncanny period piece that both thrills and keeps full enthralled attention.
","While many period pieces drag on and seem to be rather uneventful imo this product from Scott Cooper certainly delivers on holding my full attention throughout with ominous settings and suspenseful scenery. Bale is obviously a huge part of that as well with his dedicated ambition as usual for his roles. The story doesn't drag and violence is on display, something that I've seen held back on in most thriller period pieces maybe aside from Sleepy Hollow (1998). Dare I say the execution of the set pieces and costumes were much more convincing as well and gave the film more authenticity. Overall I was surprised with this film and its effectiveness.",/review/rw8794742/?ref_=tt_urv

","THE PALE BLUE EYE is an intriguing mystery thriller set in 1830 adapted from the novel of the same name written by Louis Bayard. Directed by Scott Cooper, the film follows Detective Augustus Landor (Christian Bale) as he investigates a series of murders at the U. S. Military Academy in West Point. He is assisted by a fictionalised Edgar Allan Poe (Harry Melling), an intelligent and eager young cadet who is destined to become one of America's most influential authors and the originator of the detective genre.

25 December 2022,kosmasp,10," It's all in the writing
","No pun intended - Edgar Allen Poe - I assume you have heard of him. Depending on your level of knowledge .. I reckon you may know certain things better than others. This is based on a book by someone else and Poe is not the central figure, but more like ... well you'll have to watch to figure out his role in all of this. Let's just say he is not fully developed here ... and may be just a ""fiction""/fragment of the real one - again I do not have the knowledge to really know that.",/review/rw8794742/?ref_=tt_urv

","The last time I had the pleasure to watch Victorian era supernatural murder mystery was Sleepy Hollow (1999). So it's really been a long time. Not many movies have the courage to do this kind of genre. Although this movie was way softer and down to earth compares to Sleepy Hollow, but it still has its eery moments.",/review/rw8794742/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2022,210west,6," Slow, stagey, and utterly uninvolving
","I really wanted to like this. I've had a lifelong interest in Poe, ditto West Point, ditto mysteries in general. But wow, this film just isn't very good. It's a slow, overlong, sadly uninvolving costume drama with a bunch of good actors -- including, weirdly, a handful of familiar British stars cast as West Point brass -- looking exceedingly stiff (and not in a good military sense). Except for Poe, I found it hard to tell the various cadets apart; they all looked stern and talked in haughty, stagey-sounding accents.",/review/rw8794742/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2023,terrylarosa,9," Exceptional acting and stellar directing propel
",This movie where lesser talented people might not have. Bale ( one of the best actors working today ) is his usual terrific self but right alongside him is Mellling as Poe. Many of their scenes together ( especially the last one ) are standouts though the rest of the stellar cast are all good. Only exception is Gillian who plays a rather odd woman. Cinematography was also well done with some beautiful sharp visuals. Bale and the director also did the equally good period movie Hostiles. Both are slow burns but never boring. There's also not one but two excellent twists that no one will see coming. I'd love to see Melling reprise his role as Poe in another movie. Highly recommended.,/review/rw8794742/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,Blumanowar,7," Bale is Great as usual
","The real critics were a bit hard on this one. It's great acting and while horror may not be this directors accomplished art yet, it's so much better than most horror movies I watch. So I liked it alit. Great entertainment for even the most discerning viewer. But I don't read the reviews on here anymore, only the real critics. Why would I want to hear some uneducated schmuck or film school tell me what to watch when I've watched 1000s and 1000s of movies. You should skip them too, mine too if your reading this.

8 January 2023,contactmaz,10," Absolutely superb...
","I'm not really a fan of Christian Bale, but this film was superb. The acting of all involved was immaculate. The story was intriguing and unusual, and a welcome change from the usual films that have been released. The whole setting of the film, and the filming in general, was top class. Right from the beginning I found myself hooked, and there was not a moment of dull or irrelevant scenes. It was a long film, over two hours, and very very enjoyable. I think that many of the actors were British and there was very solid acting throughout. I loved the idea of the film and I and the unexpected ending was amazing. I highly recommend this film if you are into period drama with a twist. I gave this film a rating of 10 - thoroughly deserved!!!",/review/rw8794742/?ref_=tt_urv
