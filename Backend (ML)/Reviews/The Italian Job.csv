5 November 2013,gradyharp,10," Cul-de-sac: 'Don't be scared. I just want your goodness.'
","For all the horror films that depend on zombies, vampires, werewolves and the like to place a fantasy make believe world before us to frighten us, none is as terrifying as this very realistic, extraordinarily well written, well photographed, well directed and well acted gem from Film Movement. It is a British product (BBC) and seems to have had a minimal response in the theaters. Now more available to the public, hopefully this brilliant work will attract enough attention to place it in the categories for many awards it so justly deserves. But more important, it may expose many people to the tragedies that surround us and are too often unnoticed or misunderstood.",/review/rw2738318/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2013,TheSquiss,10," Sometimes 'broken' may be repaired. But not always.
","To borrow a line from my review of last year's heartbreaking film, The Hunt (Jagten), sometimes children lie. Sometimes they are simple, instinctive lies; sometimes they are calculated as an easy escape from a truth that may have dark consequences and sometimes lives are broken as a result.",/review/rw2738318/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2013,Buscatcher,9," A little gem amongst the usual dross. Go see it.
","The three families this story entwines are Broken in different ways, all live at the end of a cul-de-sac, a nearby scrapyard features in many shots where the crushing, mangling and pounding of cars in many ways reflects their lives. The central character is the insulin dependant twelve Year old 'skunk' played by Eloise Laurence. She lives with her father Archie, (the ever reliable Tim Roth) older brother Jed and their live in housekeeper Kasia. ",/review/rw2738318/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2013,leonblackwood,8," What an emotional movie..... 8/10
","Review: What an emotional movie which has something for everyone. It's extremely well written and the characters all put in emotional and very true to life performance. The storyline doesn't hold up right from the start, and the audience cant help feeling for all the 3 families, and teacher, who are going through there own personal problems. The connection to all of the 3 families and the teacher is Skunk, who was played well by Eloise Laurence. I know that this movie was done on a budget, but the movie is top class and its a shame that a lot of people will miss this film because it isn't a major blockbuster. great Movie!",/review/rw2738318/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2013,tr91,8," Excellent drama film
",'Broken' is an excellent example of just how good British drama films/series can be when they are done right. The film is straight to the point and develops at a good pace with lots of different things going on between the various characters.,/review/rw2738318/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2013,larrys3,7," Eloise Laurence is Terrific in this Dark British Drama
","Eloise Laurence, in her motion picture debut, is really terrific as Skunk, aka Emily Cunningham, in this extremely dark British drama. Tim Roth gives his usual very solid performance as Skunk's father Archie, a lawyer who is left to raise Skunk and her brother Jed (Bill Milner) after Archie's wife has run off with an accountant. They're aided by a live-in nanny Kosia, ably portrayed by Zana Marjanovic.",/review/rw2738318/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2013,maurice_yacowar,9," Bleak view of violent, broken North Londoners and the culture
","Rufus Norris's Broken is like the early Ken Loach social dramas ramped up to the breaking point. Where British social realism centered on the working class, Broken examines three families in an upper middle class close. The characters live in spacious, well-appointed houses in a quiet North London neighborhood. So class is not an issue here. Nor is economics. Nor even is race, as the classroom easily accommodates some black children and an aerial view shows a black kid practicing his dance moves in the school parking lot -- that even the sensitive teacher Mike Kiernan (Cilliam Murphy) is too self-observed to notice. Instead of those familiar problems, here the issue is -- as you may or may not have inferred from the title -- breakage.",/review/rw2738318/?ref_=tt_urv

31 January 2015,toby-brace,9," don't see what is so complicated about this
","This is a magnificent piece of drama. Outstanding in every way. But I don't get the confusion about the message in many reviews. People have said lots of things like how it's complex and the message is hard to isolate. Well it didn't seem that way to me. The message I got was that one brutal man creates a vortex of destruction that hurts everybody around him. The father of the three girls is absolutely the source of all the grief. The fact that his girls are terrified of him, leads one of them to make a false accusation. His reaction is not to find out the truth, because, you know, teenage girls are not the most reliable witnesses. Instead he launches a savage attack on an innocent ( and helpless ) man which sets in motion a chain of events leading eventually to great tragedy. This is a guy who doesn't bother much with the truth, just violently attacks people ( twice ) on the word of his highly unreliable and conniving daughters. All the other characters have their issues, sure, but they attempt to deal with them in a civilized reasonable way. It's a dysfunctional, criminal and violent family that is the villain here.",/review/rw2738318/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2015,Prismark10,5," A tale of broken Britain
","Broken adapted from a novel and directed by Rufus Norris better known for his theatre work. The film is set in a London cul de sac and is a slice of life story with plenty of acknowledgements to the classic novel, 'To kill a Mockingbird.'",/review/rw2738318/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2013,leonfenwick,9," Just a stunning, harsh, real, heat-warming film.

4 July 2012,jihadsaade,8," A breathtaking film
","From the very beginning of the film, I got hooked by the beautiful cinematography and style, by the choice of characters and the accuracy of the details and by the visual storytelling that reminded me again and again why I fell in love with cinema in the first place.

30 December 2014,bowmanblue,9," A great and powerful Brit-flick
","British cinema does best when it doesn't try and outdo Hollywood. Here we see a simple tale of three families in the same street, all intertwining yet slowly falling apart for different reasons.",/review/rw2738318/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2013,drichmond123,9," Excellent
","I won't review the storyline because other reviewers have done so beautifully already. I just want to say that this is an excellent film with superb acting, fantastic cinematography, a complex and interesting storyline, and an emotional draw that sucks you into the lives of these characters.",/review/rw2738318/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2013,stuart_davies,4," Frustratingly Unrealistic, Ultimately Disappointing
","Tim Roth, Cillian Murphy and Denis Lawson, what great actors so surely this must be worth the risk? Yes, the acting was great, even down to the youngest was without fault. Each character was well crafted and easily believable. Their scene interactions had energy and at times where touching and poignant. In retrospect this film could have been in the same class as ""A Taste of Honey"" and certainly had the potential.",/review/rw2738318/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2015,paul2001sw-1,6," A little too broken
","Rufus Norris' film 'Broken' tells the story of a linked series of events that take place on a suburban estate from a variety of perspectives. It has all the indie clich√©s, including the wide-eyed pre-pubescent female teen protagonist, a weedy folksy soundtrack, and a fairly clumsy portrayal of the difference between the respectable middle class and the underclass (who strangely, in this story, live directly side-by-side). The plot, however, features 4 deaths, 2 beatings following false accusations of rape, and another near death, so it's not exactly authentic ""slice-of-life"" stuff. Ultimately it feels like a debut movie, Norris actually puts the pieces together with some imagination, but the story never quite feels authentic.",/review/rw2738318/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2013,ajit2106,8," Very Moving and Poignant from the eyes of a 11 year old
","An incredibly well acted drama with a lot of warmth and heart. ""Broken"" is a British realism at its best, it has been crafted so well and with such sensitivity that the audience cannot help but be touched.",/review/rw2738318/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2013,callejaiglesias,7," So Broken
","While watching this movie i was thinking about some concepts, specially the appearances and the truth behind any person, any event, any story, and also the power of sex as source of problems. These concepts have a very good case study in this British film, I want to underline ""British"" because I think it is important and it really gives a particular identity, those streets, accents, looks, school uniforms, habits, etc. are so heavy that it is definitely not a random feature.

31 January 2021,yusufpiskin,9," Rory Kinear (heart)
","This film...this film! This is why I love cinema, this is why I love British movies, my word this caught me by surprise. I loved everything about this film, the performances, the intelligence of the story, the realism. Just bloody brilliant from beginning to end. The sort of film I loved so much I couldn't recommend it for fear I'd have to stop speaking to you if you didn't agree. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.",/review/rw2738318/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2015,RockPortReview,9," Amazingly heartfelt and riveting to watch!
","The British independent film ""Broken"" broke through in the UK in 2012 with a quite a splash, winning a number of awards. The film however has sort of flown under the radar as it wasn't released in the US until last Summer by Film Movement. Its the dramatic coming of age story of an 11 year old girl affectionately named Skunk. She is played by first time actor Eloise Laurence, who gives a remarkably real and thoughtful performance. This is also the first feature film for director Rufus Norris.",/review/rw2738318/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2013,fortywood,7," New kid on the block
","So simple and yet so complicated, as often life can be. Normal houses and plain faces on your block often conceal mini dramas. A cul de sac, to be precise, symbolic perhaps of the impasse that certain characters in ""Broken"" have reached.",/review/rw2738318/?ref_=tt_urv
