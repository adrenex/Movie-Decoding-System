17 January 2012,PWNYCNY,10," Horses fought too.
","I was expecting this movie to be just another extravagant sentimental potboiler. Wow, was I surprised. This is a great movie. The title says the movie is about a horse, but it's really about a lot more than that. The horse plays a central role but the humans figure in the story too, in a big way. The cinematography is outstanding; it really conveys the bleak, gory nature of war. The movie alludes to the Battle of the Somme which is one of the costliest battles in history in terms of the sheer number of lives lost. At times the movie does lapse into sentimentality but in general the story proceeds at a fast pace (pun intended). The performances of the horses in this movie are impressive. They are stars in their own right. If the movie accomplishes nothing else, it shows that war is hard on animals too, and like the humans, they are victims too; there was never a horse that wanted to go to war. That any horses survived at all in the war is amazing. Anyway, this movie is well worth watching.",/review/rw2557424/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2011,littlemartinarocena,7," A Very Pretty Movie
","John Williams score - wall to wall - reminds us this is a Steven Spielberg film. The Spielberg from ""Always"" not the Spielberg from ""Munich"" To say the film is a sentimental boy and horse tale kinds of says it all but, to be honest, not quite all. The battle scenes, WWI this time, are from the same man (men) who gave us those glorious first 45 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" The display of means is staggering. ""Paths Of Glory"" and ""Pride Of The Marines"" came to mind. Our hero, played by Jeremy Irvine, reminded me of young heroes in Disney movies, Tommy Kirk for instance. He's pretty and harmless. But the horse, well the horse is a whole other story. Brilliant performance. I think the Academy should be seriously considering an animal category. This year alone we had this remarkable horse, plus the amazing dogs in ""Beginners"" an ""The Artist"" I know, I'm rambling, well so did ""War Horse"" but in a much prettier way of course.",/review/rw2557424/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2012,freemantle_uk,8," My Lovely Horse
","World War II has been put to film a number of times in many different countries, but there are not nearly enough World War I films. Steven Spielberg set out to redress the balance giving us War Horse, an adaptation of a children's book and the play of the same name.",/review/rw2557424/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2012,zenjunkie,9," Simply Delightful !
","I went to see this movie expecting NOT to like it. But, for 2 hours and 15 mins I was totally enthralled. I don't understand the reviews that have disliked this wonderful movie. If you want a cinematic experience this will tick the boxes. This is simply a great story - well told. Its also visually stunning. There's no stupid CGI. There's no gratuitous violence - the violent moments are tastefully choreographed and at times heartbreakingly realistic - without going for sensationalism. I'll not tell you the story or give any spoilers. Except to say this. Girls - bring hankies! Guys - don't be put off by the hankies - there's plenty of good action and the story is brilliant anyway. If you want a normal brainless CGI blockbuster - look elsewhere. If you want a class GREAT MOVIE GO AND SEE WARHORSE - you will not regret it.",/review/rw2557424/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2011,LilyDaleLady,2," I'm genuinely sorry I can't recommend or like this one

25 May 2012,Hitchcoc,6," It's About the War
","I agree that the plot is pretty sappy. If it wasn't so visually engaging I might have quit watching it. But what it does portray is a real image of war. If someone is going to be critical of the fact that horses were used in the war, it says that unless someone uses a subject you don't like, the movie isn't worth making. Yes it had all the elements of a sentimental movie. It would have really fit in well in the 1940's. Still, there is a thread running through it that allows us to root for the hero and hope that things can get better. Yes, we have some caricatures, but there were people who stood up against oppression. One even loses her life, which seemed quite a realistic result under the circumstances. The horses are horses. They don't transcend their species. They are driven by their instincts. Granted the horse in question does take on a bit of a supernatural presence. But he is the survivor horse, the one that doesn't die. That's what makes the story. This is not a great movie and it is very sentimental and totally unbelievable, but sappy stories were once the norm and we feel pretty good when it's over.",/review/rw2557424/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2011,Ramascreen,4," Underwhelming
","Beautifully shot, yes! Wonderful story, absolutely! Plus it's a war  movie that you can take your family to, but,.. WAR HORSE is  underwhelming, it gets lost in trying too hard to be a tearjerker so  much so that I hardly feel its emotional power. You can definitely  label WAR HORSE as the feel-good movie of the year, but it's nothing  short of formulaicÂ…  I'm a die hard fan of John Williams, what a brilliant composer! And his  music for this film is probably the biggest reason why I was looking  forward to WAR HORSE and it doesn't disappoint. His new music is as  memorable as his previous scores in the past. The film however just  doesn't work for me, even with the gorgeous cinematography by Janusz  Kaminski. The fact that it's made by Spielberg, certainly would still  attract audiences, but just don't expect it to be like Saving Private  Ryan or Empire Of The Sun, because WAR HORSE is not on that same level.  I do admire whatever method the production applied to train the horse  for this film, and I'm sure they used more than just one horse for the  character Joey. There are certain scenes that might make animal lovers  everywhere cringe because of what those scenes required the horse to  seemingly do. In the story, the horse Joey encounters several human  characters, besides Albert, through its unexpected journey and sadly  the film doesn't allow us enough chance to get to deeply know those  human characters There is a point where Joey is so crushed by  excruciating grief that he starts to run like the wind and it even  doesn't care which way it's going, it doesn't care about living and  dying either, and that tells you the film's intention all along, to  make Joey have some kind of human-like personality, this happens when  you deal with movies that have animals as their lead stars, which goes  back to formulaic. So that aspect would resonate with audiences who  love films like Babe. I just feel the film doesn't challenge itself and  it leaves me with an indifferent afterthought.  WAR HORSE has its funny and heartfelt moments, the themes are  empowering and liberating, they exude strength and loyalty, there is no  denying, in addition to a very hopeful ending but it plays it safe and  it's not one of my favorite Spielberg films.",/review/rw2557424/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2011,jdesando,," A rouser
","I have not seen a better movie than War Horse to introduce mature youngsters to the concept of war and its effects. In addition, the idea of WWI: the Great War, the war to end all wars is a history lesson only movies can make real. Besides, it's a rousing adventure.",/review/rw2557424/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2011,Loving_Silence,10," A Stunning and Enthralling Epic
","Steven Spielberg has assembled many fantastic movies, like Schindler's List, Jaws, E.T, Saving Private Ryan, etc. His new creation, War Horse is a stunning achievement. The film was professionally made, it looked amazing, sounded great. Legendary composer, John Williams crafted an amazing and beautiful score.

2 January 2012,fred-houpt,5," Mediocre and mostly improbable horse tale
","I quite enjoy most of Spielberg's films. From the trailers I had moderate expectations that he would deliver good entertainment value, which is why we go to the cinema in the first place. I am not familiar with the novel that this film is based on and know nothing of the play version. I know a few facts about WW1. The operative word that kept going through my mind in the film was ""improbable"". It is a given that at some point in most films you are requested to surrender your belief that the images are realistic representations of some story. In this case WW1 is a fairly well known event so if you place your drama in the midst of it you had better get it right.",/review/rw2557424/?ref_=tt_urv

10 January 2012,theindustry,8," Very well made. A modern film reminiscent of the classics.
","It is well understood from the first few scenes that the typical clichÃ© of both war films and animal dramas will stain Spielberg's canvas, yet the film pushes forward, earning well-deserved praise. Quite a few scenes are captivating to say the least; as is the scene with the horse, Joey, forging through heavily barb-wired no man's land.",/review/rw2557424/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2012,Rockwell_Cronenberg,1," Everything wrong with Spielberg.
","My hatred for Steven Spielberg has been made no secret by me over the years and when it comes to an example as to why, nothing in his career works as well as War Horse. This is a film loaded to the brim with all of the nauseating cheese and sentimentality that makes me shudder whenever I see his name attached to a film. Almost from the start you can just taste the gooey sweetness pouring off the screen and it never really stops.",/review/rw2557424/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2012,barbara-364,9," Stunning film, a visual feast
","This film is a treat to watch. I was keen to see it, but had reservations about watching scenes from world war one. I had no need to worry. The whole thing was beautifully handled and even the filming of the trenches and the front were carefully composed and lit. Joey the horse is the lead actor. And what an actor! What a handsome horse! He certainly stole the film. Some scenes stay with me. The race with the car, the friendship with the black horse, the Geordie regiment bagpipe player in the trench, the German soldiers helping the worn out horses drag those great guns up the slope. Joey bolting through the barbed-wire fencing. A friend I was with remarked afterwards that Roses of Picardy had not been written in 1914 and that the record it was being played on was from about three decades later. These are really small details in what appeared to me to be a meticulously researched film. I hope it has a world wide audience. It deserves one.",/review/rw2557424/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2012,Red_Identity,," One of the weakest films of the year
","Ever since I saw the trailer for War Horse back in early 2011, I was not impressed. It looked like a sappy, cheesily sentimental, and clichÃ©d war film. When the film came out and started gaining Oscar buzz in the major categories, I was surprised and wonderedÂ… why? The reviews were also mostly positive, but I was still not convinced that I would like this. Well, I finally saw it, and guess whatÂ…it's not a good film, but it surprised me in the way as to why it's not a good film.",/review/rw2557424/?ref_=tt_urv

I went in with relatively low expectations, after watching the series of mediocre trailers, and walked out being able to safely say that War Horse is one of the best movies of the year, one of Steven Spielberg's best films, and, quite possibly, one of the best war films ever made, up there with my personal favorites The Thin Red Line, Apocalypse Now and Paths of Glory.

","Did I watch the same film that the other reviewers here watched? Because I found nothing but obvious Oscar bait. It was as if someone wrote a list of every possible tear-jerking story clichÃ© and checked off as many as they could fit within time and budget constraints. Horses? Check! War? Check! Plucky youngsters? Check and check! Plucky youngsters fighting to save the farm! Plucky youngsters fighting to keep the horse! Plucky youngsters who were previously enemies now getting along! Plucky youngsters severely wounded but staying plucky! I could go on. Really, I could.

29 January 2012,planktonrules,5," But what if you don't particularly adore horses?!
","I assume that there are two main groups of people--those who adore horses and think they are beautiful creatures as well as those, like me, who see them as a means of transportation or food (in a crunch--when beef isn't available). So, some see the film as magical--while others see it was incredibly empty. Unlike the Oscar folks (who have nominated it for Best Picture), I found the picture to be very episodic and I didn't particularly care for the characters--and some of this might be because I don't absolutely love horses (though I really have nothing against them).",/review/rw2557424/?ref_=tt_urv
