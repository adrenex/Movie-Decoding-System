20 February 2012,vivnista,10," TV at its best
","If you want history at its truth, watch a documentary. As entertainment this show has it all. Every episode has had me in tears from either laughter or poignancy. The casting is perfect and beautifully shot. It really shows the diverse community that has embedded itself in our culture today. Who cares if the docks were not in the right place! The show is about people coming together in tough times and bonding with a community regardless of class and colour. It makes me yearn for that kind of spirit in todays world where everyone has so much and yet is never satisfied. I really hope the BBC invest in a new series - I already miss Miranda!",/review/rw4907764/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2016,maria-ricci-1983,10," Realistic, modern, seductive and deep, with poignant moral questions.
","**UPDATE AFTER SEASON 6: If I could mark 11 stars, that would be it. The episodes about the Thalidomide children were hard but very well focused and treated. I am intrigued at how they film the scenes with just born babies in the very hands of the actors, with wide shots, not just close-ups. Call the Midwife is a most humanistic show indeed, focused on believable, realistic positive values. In a time when humanism seems to be disgraced and devalued everywhere, it is most welcome in my screen.***",/review/rw4907764/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2014,zena-1,10," Reminds me
","As I was a student nurse in the East End of London during the mid fifties,(now an ex-pat living in Mexico) this series brings back many memories. I'm glad that some episodes include general nursing and even male patients as well as midwifery. Perhaps doctors were not always as good as the nurses in those days.I even remember an anaesthetist who sat doing his crossword puzzles during operations and no one dared utter a word of reproach.",/review/rw4907764/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2014,black-and-gold,9," Faith in humanity
","Whether or not this series' depiction of the East End in the 50's is completely accurate or not seems of little relevance to me. The characters are very likable and the acting, even by the guest actors, is brilliant. However, the main reason I love and wholeheartedly recommend Call the Midwife is because it is so well written, without avoiding the harsh realities of life yet filled with hope and incredible human connection. Miraculously, it manages this without ever becoming cheesy. Every episode leaves me feeling proud to be a human being. I don't think many TV series are able or even try to achieve this and it feels especially important in our times when faith in humanity seems to be in decline.",/review/rw4907764/?ref_=tt_urv

7 July 2016,graduatedan,9," The milk of human kindness
","It's hard to believe that anyone could be as compassionate and tender as the midwives in Call the Midwife, compassion and tenderness being rare qualities in the increasingly disconnected world of the 21st century. I suspect those qualities are a real incentive for even the casual viewer of this series, which depicts the lives of midwives toiling in the east London of the late 50s- early 1960s. The world of almost 60 years ago was a very different one from today, both from a social and technological standpoint. I'm impressed by the attention to detail in the series, which allows viewers to immerse themselves in the stories, which touch upon issues such as abortion and incest, as well as the then real threats of polio and tuberculosis. More recent stories have even addressed the thalidomide tragedy. The acting is, without exception, top notch, especially that of Judy Parfitt as Sister Monica Joan. I tend to be especially critical of shows that rely on lachrymose sentimentality to further the story. Call the Midwife is at times tender, sweet tempered and, well, nice, but never false as it displays the panorama of the human condition.",/review/rw4907764/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is one of the best shows on tv. I discovered it two years ago while watching a Masterpiece presentation. Haven't missed an episode since. I prefer shows like The Americans, The Walking Dead, Fargo, etc. but this one struck a chord somewhere in the depths of my psyche and I instantly liked the stories, the scenery of 1960's London and all of the characters. This is television at its best.",/review/rw4907764/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have to say I am a bit of a BBC miniseries junkie. So, I am always looking for a new world to jump into. I have to say that ""Call the Midwife"" is one of the best series I have seen. I am enchanted by the young girls and their commitment to caring for their community. And what makes it even more perfect is that they work alongside nuns and can see the world through their eyes. I watch this show over and over again hoping to be dazzled once again (and I always am). I don't know how accurate it is (I have not studied the time), but I do think it is a fantastic commentary on poverty, the role of women, and social class differences. If this were only a drama I wouldn't watch it again and again. But the humor (CHUMMY!!) and the light hearted moments among the business of birth is perfect! Truly, I would love to drop myself into that time and live simply where my only goal was to help women and love people well. You will thoroughly enjoy this show it sisterhood, faith, love, and courage interest you.",/review/rw4907764/?ref_=tt_urv

","After the introduction to the series last year, I didn't think it could be topped, but with it's sometimes gritty, always touching stories Call the Midwife, Season Two has proved the series has staying power. It's easy to see why Call the Midwife is so popular in the States and abroad. Stories of sisterly bonds among friends and the miracle of childbirth never get old.",/review/rw4907764/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2014,thrall7,10," As good as anything in many, many years on Masterpiece
","My wife and I have been regular viewers of PBS' various British dramas for more than 40 years. I believe that ""Call the Midwife"" stands with anything that PBS has shown in that time. The cast is outstanding, and is aided by terrific writing. The producers and writers have done a very good job of pulling stories from the books, and presenting an element of 20th Century London history that most American viewers knew nothing about. There is a wonderful blend of humor, sadness, and an overall sense of time and place that is rarely achieved in TV dramas. I have particularly liked the sensitive portrayal of the sisters throughout the series, since (believe it or not) my mother had studied to become a nun. They are consistently shown as a complete person, not characterized as stiff and robotic people. If you haven't read the books the series is based upon, try them. You will see how faithfully the producers have followed them. A wonderful series!",/review/rw4907764/?ref_=tt_urv

Whether you are a young woman with it all in front of you, or past child-bearing age - it is forever interesting! :-) This series really have it all: humour and high drama, sorrow and happiness, love of all kinds, interesting characters, and a touch of religion.

16 July 2017,zuzuspetals70000,10," The Best Series Since Downton
","At the risk of gushing about this series, I can't even begin to put in words how wonderful ""Call The Midwife"" is. For many of us who are mid-century babies, these women -- both nurses and the maternity patients -- are very much like our own mothers in those years. Even the soundtrack can take you back decades in a single song note - - my Mom and Dad's music. There are some reminders, too, about what parents no longer have to face, like polio, diphtheria, thalidomide, epidemics of measles (I was caught up in one in the early 60s, remember it vividly and it was horrible. They thought I might lose my sight and thus was kept in a darkened room for which seemed like an eternity.) It's a blessing my children and others never had to go through any of it.

22 October 2012,bbewnylorac,6," Veering back towards too much treacle
","You do have to admire this series for surviving for nine seasons now (2020) - and don't get me wrong, I love the fantastic sets, locations, costumes, and little period details. Not to mention the great topics that each episode brings up, related to midwives working in the 1950s and 1960s in the East End of London. The acting is great, although Sister Julienne and Sister Monica Joan, Trixie the nurse and the doctor are possibly the only original characters. In the beginning, the series tried to make births look realistic, with a bit of blood and babies not being born freshly washed. Those scenes are less realistic these days. But lately two things have bothered me. Firstly, the penchant for happy endings. It doesn't matter if there's a woman considering an abortion or a baby born with a birth defect or a disabled boy sent to an orphanage - everything has to turn out rosy in the end. No one has to live with an incurable disease because there's no cure. If someone suffers racism, there are hordes of people to treat them nicely and to strike back. The writers ignore how in the real world, unpleasant things happened to people and sometimes there isn't a happy ending or cure. The other thing I hate is that treacly, apple pie language. The midwives all talk as though they're reading a very crisp British children's book of the 1960s. They don't swear, they always behave impeccably and never do or say anything sly or dishonest. No one is that perfect. I really hate the continuing Vanessa Redgrave voiceover at the start and the end of each episode, too. But this series has been up and down, so my next review might be a better one.",/review/rw4907764/?ref_=tt_urv

3 June 2017,barryrd,9," Values to live by
","I think we need more movies that embody the values of people who follow their conscience and do what's right for themselves and others. Call the Midwife is a fine example. Nonatus House is a convent for a group of Anglican nursing sisters in the east end of London, post World War II. Sister Julienne, the sister superior, is played by Jenny Agutter who brings us an example of discipline softened by love for her community of sisters and caring for the neighbourhood they serve. The narrator, whose voice is that of Vanessa Redgrave, describes her life at the house before she chooses to marry and take up family life. At one point we see her as an elderly woman at home in the present. Her writing is beautiful and describes the values they lived by. Judy Parfitt is Sister Monica, who often becomes a counsellor to the younger nuns, patients and friends in the community. Although afflicted by dementia, she speaks truth in confused situations. Her zest for life can be the spark that gives hope and takes others out of an often tragic world. The minor characters and the neighbours provide their own stories, like the thalidomide babies or the loss of babies and mothers in childbirth. We also see how the Nonatus nuns cope with poverty and failed marriages among the women who come for help. The improvements brought by government medical care are shown as the series evolves. Changes in the cast and their personal lives also reflect reality. We do not view plaster saints but for the most part, people with the same hopes and dreams as everyone. They are flawed but their best instincts usually prevail. It is good for us to view the hardships that life can serve up and see how good people come to terms with severe setbacks in a hopeful and positive way. It is truly inspiring.",/review/rw4907764/?ref_=tt_urv

","I do agree with those reviewers who have pointed out that this is not a documentary but a drama. Yes indeed some details are wrong ( I grew up in the UK in this era so have some knowledge of it, tho not quite so grindingly poor) True, that the nuns are not, to me, very believable, appearing, apart from the lovely chanted prayers, to have no spiritual life or discipline at all . Still they are good TV , though not as utterly great TV as Miranda Hart as Chummy. I think it unlikely that Lady Fortescue Cholmondley -Brown would have capitulated as easily as she did, but who cares .It was worth it if only for Chummy's line ""Sorry Mater, not entitled any more"" when exhorted to wear white for her wedding...",/review/rw4907764/?ref_=tt_urv

","I happen to like shows that highlight the bright side of humanity. This is the show for that. I just started watching (on S1E3) and have gotten teary eyed several times. No cliche's here such as all religious people being evil or husbands being abusers. Instead they highlight the beautiful part of being human and caring about others. I resisted watching this, thought it would be boring or soap opera-ish or politically driven. A friend the knows me well kept saying I would love it and she was right, I do. While it does cover social issues it feels like there is no particular agenda other than the facts of life during the time period covered and how people can show compassion towards one another.",/review/rw4907764/?ref_=tt_urv
