16 May 2017,dakjets,8," Haunting and beautiful
","I have to admit that I had low expectations when I was going to see this movie. The negative reviews are why. Appearance that the film has gone bad, not earned enough, etc. But it does not make sense to listen to others. The best part is to find out yourself. And I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie well, even though I understand some of the criticisms. At the same time, I know that Morten Tyldum is an incredibly good director. One of the best Norwegian directors, without a doubt. I think it's strange that he made something directly bad. The film is not a featured sci fi movie, even if the action takes place on a spaceship. I enjoyed the movie for three reasons: 1) The story is unique, and something I've never seen before. It's always a good sign. 2) It's beautiful to watch, great movie, spectacular setups and scenes. It was impressive and 3) This movie works to switch between a love story and some action sequences. It seems like a thoughtful movie, and I appreciated the thought behind scenes and action. The few people we meet in the film give insight and one becomes familiar with the characters. It is also a strength, but perhaps also a weakness. The gallery is limited. But anyway, I recommend this and hope to see similar movies in the future.",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2018,Sleepin_Dragon,9," Very original, beautifully made.
","Passengers is a truly brilliant movie, it's hard to place it into a genre, but it is very much a sci fi love story. The concept is a great one, and it poses a fabulous question, could you force someone to spend their life with you, or live a solitary life. The idea is very original and very clever, the special effects are breathtaking, and the cinematography is first class. The main trio of actors do a superb job, but it's the dazzling Jennifer Lawrence that stood out for me.",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2017,TheLittleSongbird,7," Romance and sci-fi in outer space
","Although 'Passengers' had one of the most unique concepts of any film in recent years, had talented actors on board and the production values looked wonderful from the advertising, the critical reception (not just from critics but also from those who dislike Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence and immediately saying the film would be terrible, not being ignorant this actually happened) was a turn off.",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2022,davidlohr,9," Waking Her Saved Them
",I love how everyone seems to miss the fact that if he had not woke her up everyone would've died. He wouldn't have had anyone to pull the lever to release the reactor pressure while he held open the blast door. She also had the option to return to sleep using the autodoc and CHOSE not to. Did y'all naysayers even pay attention?,/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2017,kosmasp,8," Long way to go
","I heard the critics too. And I get that this is not for everyone. But I do believe that a rating that is currently around 7 (out of 10) is pretty accurate for this movie. It is good, it's not amazing or breath taking (excuse the pun), but it really is suspenseful and it does keep it real (if you buy into the whole notion that this space mission/travel thing is or will be possible in the first place of course).",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2017,SnoopyStyle,6," movie starts at the wrong place
","The Starship Avalon is transporting 258 crew and 5000 passengers in hibernation to the colony on faraway planet Homestead II. The ship is hit by debris and malfunctions slowly infect the system. Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) is awaken when his pod malfunctions. He is all alone except for robot bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen). He is unable to access the more sensitive ship systems. After a year of loneliness, Jim is suicidal and then he falls in love with Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence). He decides to disable her pod and wake her up but keep the decision from her.",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2016,Samirsbureau,7," A highly enjoyable ride that unfortunately got rolled over by the Critics.
","After the trailer release of this movie it became one of this year's most anticipated movies, but some people were expecting something entirely different than what this movie aimed for, and the result was their disappointment. ",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2017,fig-75275,8," A moral problem beautifully presented and executed.
","I enjoyed Passengers a lot. It's not perfect though. The spaceship is beautiful from both the outside and the inside, and you get the impression that future technology is really fantastic. The computer systems are pretty dumb though (including Michael Sheen's android). This is all forgivable though, because if the computers weren't dumb the story wouldn't work.",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2016,Nobody-27,8," Haters gonna hate, but moviegoers have plenty to enjoy here
","I don't quite get all the hate that this film gets... I can also think of great number of recent alleged sci-fi films that don't deserve a minute of one's time, yet they are cherished and loved.",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2019,web-534-393830,10," When wrong is right
","Incredible how simple and yet enchanting this story is. If Jim didn't make that wrong decision, then everybody would have died, which made his decision not only right but necessary. Well acted and wrapped with an effective soundtrack, this succession of different approaches to the same situation bring me to watch Passengers again and again at home and still discover something new about humanity. Highly recommended.",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2022,handmethatspanner,9," The Critics -- wrong again

27 January 2017,saccitygrl,7," Romancing the vastness of space
","I dislike reviews that summarize the plot or discuss the plot unless the latter is done to support an opinion. So, I will not do this in this review. Here are my thoughts and impressions.",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2016,patrickjames85,8," Passengers was fantastic!
","Passengers is yet another example as to why you should go see the movies professional critics hate & save your money on the ones they absolutely love. Going to see a movie at the theater is like $30 now for just 2 people & that's without visiting concessions. I don't know about everybody else but if I'm going to spend a few days worth of grocery money for a 2 hour movie experience I'm really hoping not to be bored to tears or looking at the time wondering how much longer it'll be until a movie is over. Passengers just ends up on my very long list, lately, of movies critics tried to bring down that were waves better than the ones they are directing people to see. This movie is visually stunning & the story telling is not only thought provoking but innovative while doing so! It was great to see a story like this one told in a way that didn't spend most of its time trying to dialogue it's way into Oscar nominations. If you are going to venture out to see a movie for the Holidays go see this one!",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2016,Theo Robertson,6," Moderately Engaging SF Romance That Needed Darker Elements
","The trailers to this film gives the impression that it's something of a weepy romance set aboard a spaceship . Guess what ? If nothing else at least the trailers are being relatively honest and to be honest I almost gave the movie a miss due to its predictable content , but decided to give it a chance to find it perhaps wasn't as predictable as I predicted it to be . Even so I still came away thinking it was a missed opportunity ",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2017,jason-210,6," An good sci-fi flick with some excellent special effects.
","Note that this contains spoilers. If you haven't watched the film, I suggest you do before reading this.",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2017,Damien_King86,6," A decent sci-fi rental that plays it too safe.
","I'm just going to list my takeaways from the movie in list format. Maybe it will be helpful to someone, maybe not. ",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2016,PyroSikTh,8," Offers a Controversial Ethical Dilemma
","Passengers follows the 120-year trip of the spacecraft Avalon to an off-world colony, carrying over five thousand passengers looking to start a new life. Unfortunately something goes wrong along the way and Jim is woken up from hibernation early - ninety years early. He finds himself alone on a luxury cruiser where his travel bracelet will only allow him basic amenities, with only an android barman for company. Slightly spoilerish, but I will be discussing at length: After a year of painful loneliness, Jim discovers Aurora's pod, is captivated by her beauty, watches her boarding logs and reads her books and falls into an obsessive infatuation that leads him, out of desperation, to decide to wake her up and condemn her to spending the rest of her life aboard the Avalon, just like him.",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2017,Paradroid78,5," Romance movie pretending to be sci-fi
","The trailers made this out as serious science fiction, but it was basically a glorified ""boy meets girl"" movie in space. ",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2017,eddie_baggins,7," A visually impressive Sci-Fi romance
","It's not hard to see what Passengers could've been, but this big budgeted and much hyped Sci-Fi romance starring two of the worlds most well-liked Hollywood stars is one of the more curiously forgotten-about spectacles of the increasingly busy end of year releases. Really, though, this largely critically panned feature is not half as bad as many have called it out to be.",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2017,lee_eisenberg,8," Jen and Chris pay homage to Kubrick
","I admit that Morten Tyldum's ""Passengers"" isn't any sort of masterpiece, but it's nonetheless an impressive piece of work. Aside from the main plot, I liked the tributes to Stanley Kubrick's movies (setting in outer space, talking computers, the bar scenes, trying to chop through a door; just add a Beethoven soundtrack and you'd have a clean sweep).",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2017,Platypuschow,6," Passengers: The Beautiful People Movie
","I was highly skeptical of Passengers, though I liked the concept I simply couldn't see past the studio literally picking the two ""Hottest"" young current stars as the leads. It all seemed so forced, right down to their criminally photoshopped cover images.",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2016,steen-mpi,9," Eminent Science Fiction
","Professional film critics are stupid. That is the conclusion you must reach after watching this movie. I was not expecting much after reading the uniformly negative critical reviews. But I was surprised. The movie is plausible. It is more than plausible, it is realistic. And the acting is so eminent that you are there yourself trying to decide what you would do if you awoke on a fully autonomous spaceship trying to figure out what is going on.",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2016,bkrauser-81-311064,3," A Maddening Sci-Fi with Nothing to Say
","Science Fiction is supposed to be about big ideas. It's supposed to utilize our highest aspirations, exhibit our biggest accomplishments, perhaps exploit our biggest fears. When we venture to a long time ago in a galaxy far away, go where no man has gone before or stumble into another edition of Thunderdome, it's expected that in these fantastical worlds, there's something important worth saying. Passengers seems to be saying anything, and I mean anything, is justified in the name of romance. Oh goody, a space adventure with the mentality of a mid-nineties romantic comedy. Bring on the creepy.",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2016,elementxo,10," Ignore the critics- a great movie with lots of suspense
","I'm almost convinced film critics are paid off...I thoroughly enjoyed this movie more than most of the ""critically acclaimed"" films I've watched this year. This movie had everything- love, drama, philosophical/existential questions, and incredibly suspenseful moments (and not just action scenes!!). The acting was great, pacing was good (never was bored), and the visuals were amazing as well. Also the trailer didn't spoil the movie at all, which was nice. My only gripe would be about the ending, which was still fine.",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2016,Avyrius,9," I cannot understand all those bad reviews of Passengers
","The movie is definitely worth your time. Firstly, 10/10 for realism. I would absolutely have done all those things if I were in their shoes. Secondly, the acting is one of the best I've seen (I was pretty skeptical about J.Lawrence but not anymore after this movie; and Chris Pratt's acting keeps getting better and better since GotG). The plot is quite unique (I do not believe I've ever seen another plot that resemble this). Lastly, the visuals is BREATHTAKING (I absolutely adore the ship design).",/review/rw3604559/?ref_=tt_urv
