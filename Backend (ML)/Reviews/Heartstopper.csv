29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Really Good!
","As a huge fan of Marvel I'm a little biased because I pretty much like everything they put out. My bias aside, Jessica Jones is terrific! If you don't believe me just read through the reviews here and look at the ratings. Even the critics loved this. Krysten Ritter was born to play Jessica Jones. She is easily the best part of the show. This is a show that you'll want to binge as quickly as you can, it's that good. It's too bad that Netflix couldn't renew their contracts with Marvel and they had to stop making the Netflix Marvel shows because every single one of them was great! Now that they're on Disney they can bring these wonderful characters back. They already started to with Daredevil and Kingpin and just renewed Daredevil for another season. Now they have to do the same for The Punisher, Luke Cage and Jessica Jones. At least bring them back into the MCU somehow. If you're a Marvel fan then this is a must watch!",/review/rw4092509/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2021,Supermanfan-13,9," Entertaining!
","Krysten Ritter was absolutely fantastic as Jessica Jones! And as great as she was, Rachael Taylor was equally as bad as Trish Walker. I was rooting for her character to die throughout the entire series! Overall, Jessica Jones is a really good tv show and while it's not quite as good as ""The Punisher"" or ""Daredevil"", it's still good and absolutely worth watching! Anyway, this is so much more than just a Superhero show, it's an intense psychological drama that is incredibly well written. Kilgrave (David Tennant) is one of the best bad guys in any Superhero movie or tv show ever. He's not the best but he's up there. It may start a little slow for some but stick with it because I promise it gets better. All 3 seasons are great!",/review/rw4092509/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2021,garry-anderton,8," Enjoyable, if a little clunky at times
",Really entertaining show. Only let down by the occasional face palm moment here and there. David Tennant is wonderful and adds a much needed touch of class to proceedings. Carrie Ann Moss is also very good. Other performances are...hit and miss. Overall a solid - if occasionally dopey - show.,/review/rw4092509/?ref_=tt_urv

8 December 2022,vibhus-17780,8," Good
","A good detective series with Superhero and Vigilante stuff . It's a detective series , more than investigations it has good dramas . First of all writers did a great job in characterisation for the characters , eventhough season 2 & 3 misses the intriguing kinda storytelling as season 1 , somehow it manages by intresting character arc . Season 1 was totally good and the best season of the Series . Season 2 & 3 were good too , but bit boring sometimes , not upto the mark of season 1 . We can easily notice series majorly missed good production value , so making wise it was bit odd . Action sequences were mostly clumsy . Cast did a great job especially Krysten Ritter as Jessica Jones was impressive . Overall a good series to watch .",/review/rw4092509/?ref_=tt_urv

","This show was alright, it is a bit slow, it's pretty good to watch, it's really cool at some parts, some good acting in this show, it definitely takes a long time to finish but I guess you could say it's worth it, it was a pretty decent show.",/review/rw4092509/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2021,frantzen79,8," For me the best of the ""defenders universe"".
","First and third season are both very good. Second season is a little below par. But generally the writing, the characters and the action scenes are just better than the others (although i did like Iron Fist to, unlike most).
The villains in season 1 and 3 are also very good. I really hated them and that makes you more invested.
I also think the humour is better in this show. Especially in season 1.",/review/rw4092509/?ref_=tt_urv

19 September 2021,eva3si0n,7," Not bad series from Marvel
","Jessica Jones causes twofold feelings after the first season. The series itself is executed at the middle level, in fact the series is more for femenists than for an ordinary viewer. The whole series holds on to the main antagonist - Killgrave, which is very specific to it super-ability.",/review/rw4092509/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2021,Ahmedfadil00,8," my opinion
","The series, as the first two parts, was very beautiful, but the third part, the story is not convincing and has no meaning for whom Jesica Jones remains in the heart.",/review/rw4092509/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2015,TouchTheGarlicProduction,9," AKA a brilliant show with a truly menacing and memorable villain.
","If for nothing else, watch Jessica Jones for David Tennant's performance as Kilgrave. He is better than any other Marvel movie or TV villain ever seen before. He is truly terrifying but oddly hypnotizing. He can make you do whatever he tells you to. Not only does David Tennant's charisma make this believable, but the writers use it in a lot of cool ways. As a villain, he's right up there with Heath Ledger's Joker.",/review/rw4092509/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2018,gspencley,5," Season 1 was a MASTERPIECE / Season 2 was terrible
","This review pains me to write, because I genuinely think that Season 1 was the pinnacle of serialized television. It had amazing plotting, a satisfying ending, a terrifying villain, characters that I loved, nothing superfluous, beautiful cinematography and tone. It delivered on every promise that it made.

26 January 2023,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,9," My weakness? Occasionally I give a crap
","When we first meet private investigator Jessica Jones(Ritter, snark personified), she's a recovering rape survivor. She has PTSD, as we see from the coping mechanism of naming her childhood home's streets, and her symptoms. These include trouble falling asleep, and even when she does, such as on the subway(which gives you an Idea of how badly she needs to rest. The smell and noise of it alone seems like it should be enough that you could never catch Zs, not to mention how many people around you don't trust being vulnerable near) she almost immediately comes to. The reason for this is simple. Whenever she starts to lose consciousness, immediately it feels like her abuser is right behind her, whispering in her ear, licking her(!). Her trauma is taken seriously, and it's put front and center.",/review/rw4092509/?ref_=tt_urv

","In New York City, Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter) is a troubled private eye with superhuman strength. She drinks to cope with the PTSD from her rape. She is horrified when her tormentor Kilgrave (David Tennant) returns. Her lifelong best friend is her equally troubled adoptive sister Trish Walker (Rachael Taylor) who struggles with drug addiction and her controlling mother as a former child star. Malcolm Ducasse is a recovering neighbor who gets involved with Jessica's work. Jeri Hogarth (Carrie-Anne Moss) is a driven lawyer with her own agenda. Jessica reconnects with her birth mother Alisa (Janet McTeer) in the second season. In the third season, Trish gains her own powers as the ladies battle a serial killer.",/review/rw4092509/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2022,abdoamador99,10," One of the best Marvel tv shows ever made for sure
","Since i watched the season 1 in Netflix ( now in Disney plus) i knew that Jessica Jones will be different to any show ever made by Marvel before , the way they created the show along Melissa Rosenberg was phenomenal and so different to other superheroes shows or movies made before . Krysten Ritter and Rachael Taylor made an awesome performance with her characters ( all the characters are awesome and deserve their own credit), 3 seasons of pure entertainment also is a pure psychological tv show that you will love if you like Marvel universe or just are looking for a good tv serie ( like i said, very different comparing with Advengers stuff) ,that's for sure.",/review/rw4092509/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2018,Tomus7,5," Why did they have to make her so incompetent?
","We didn't mind the other unusual aspects of her characters, but we couldn't bear how incompetent she is. So many episodes were the same: jessica captures Kilgrave, jessica decides not to kill him, so he escapes and kills more poeple. And repeat.",/review/rw4092509/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2020,classicsoncall,7," ""Maybe it's enough that the world thinks I'm a hero.""
","I have to admit, I never knew 'Jessica Jones' started out as a Marvel Comic, much less as part of the super-hero universe. So when I came across the series as a Netflix offering, I figured I would give it a try after watching ""The Punisher"" and ""Daredevil"". The writing for the show was generally pretty good, but I didn't think it was as compelling as the other two I just mentioned. The concept of the mind controlling villain Kilgrave (David Tennant) started out as menacing enough, but I thought as the story went on, it should have been more of a fait accompli to defeat him once Jessica (Krysten Ritter) realized she was immune to his will. One of the kicks I got out of watching was realizing the character Trish Walker (Rachael Taylor) was based on yet another comic book, a teen romantic-comedy series from the Sixties I'd happen to read now and then if one came my way. My ears also perked up when I heard the name 'Sabrina' mentioned in one of the episodes, because that was another series from back in the day. 'Millie the Model' was another one, but I never heard of anyone mentioned by that name, all part of the Marvel family by way of earlier publishers. Then of course, there's also Luke Cage (Mike Colter), who has his own series on Netflix which I'll delve into after wrapping up with Jessica. Besides the show in it's own right, I really like the idea of co-mingling the characters from other series with cameo appearances, like nurse Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson) and Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson) from ""Daredevil"", and cop/detective Brett Mahoney (Royce Johnson) from DD and ""The Punisher"". It adds to the enjoyment of all the programs, wondering who will pop up when and where. My review here by the way, is for the first season of ""Jessica Jones"" I just completed. It appears that many viewers weren't as appreciative of the later two seasons that followed the 2015 run. I'll get to those in due time, while trying to maintain the chronological continuity of the other series based on Marvel characters.",/review/rw4092509/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2016,erinkay641,10," All Around Amazing
","I am truly baffled by the negative reviews. This show is incredible. Every character is truly fascinating and we get glimpses of their back stories to supplement the story, but I guess people are disappointed that not everything was revealed immediately? I am almost positive that the mystery of Jessica Jones' background is intentional and they will reveal more as the show develops. As for people that complain that the show is boring....these must be the people keeping things like the Transformers series in business. If you're looking for constant explosions and action, you'll be disappointed. However, if you are looking for a show with well developed characters, a chilling villain, a compelling and relatable main character, an intriguing storyline, and just utterly spectacular acting, this is the show for you. No, it's not a typical superhero show. It goes above and beyond in so many aspects. This has raised the bar for superhero stories, in my opinion. Krysten Ritter is superb and very believable as Jessica Jones. I love love love this show! Give it a chance, you will not be sorry you did! I can't wait for Season 2.",/review/rw4092509/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2019,emmaandersson-84973,5," Loved season 1. By season 3 not so much.
","I loved so much about season 1. But even if I try to think forgiving thoughts about a characters stupidity that sort of just goes on and on. Seamingly with no lesson learned. Ever. I can't get over every other stupid, reckless and well STUPID thing Trish does in season 2 & 3. Season one was a 9 for me. Now after 3. My annoyance with the way they wrote Trish (her actions) leave me at a 5. But I LOVED season 1.",/review/rw4092509/?ref_=tt_urv

",Imagine if Jessica Jones hadn't recently undergone the entire adventure with The Defenders...or had...but learned absolutely nothing from it.
