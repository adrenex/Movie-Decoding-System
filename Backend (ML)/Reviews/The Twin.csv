21 August 2010,imdbbl,," Not nearly as good as the original.
","The Experiment is a 2010 American thriller film directed by Paul Scheuring and starring Adrien Brody, Forest Whitaker,Cam Gigandet and Maggie Grace.The film is also a remake of the 2001 German film Das Experiment, which was directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel. The experiment begins when 26 men are chosen to participate in the roles of guards and prisoners in a psychological study that ultimately spirals out of control. $14,000 for two weeks, it is easy-earned money. The study examines aggressive behavior in an artificial prison setting. At first the tenants are divided randomly into prisoners and guards, but soon a spiral of violence begins.

21 October 2010,claudio_carvalho,1," How to Destroy a German Masterpiece
","The German ""Das Experiment"" is one of the best and most powerful movies of the Twentieth-First Century. Tense, powerful, having a wonderful screenplay and outstanding direction and performances, it is another great example of how the absolute power corrupts. ""Das Experiment"" is a must-see movie, which will certainly provoke reactions on the viewer.",/review/rw2298852/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2010,fpollinger,6," Important Message, but a movie with flaws
","First off: I am German and i've seen the original Das Experiment many years ago. I wouldn't call all Americans dumb because they remake foreign movies. In fact this movie is better in some ways, like the acting of Forest Whitaker, which reminds me like a evolution from a stay-at-home-dude to his interpretation of Idi Amin.",/review/rw2298852/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2021,Ruskington,5," Disturbing but lacking subtlety
","One of those remakes that adds nothing and takes away nearly everything. Extremely unpleasant to watch but the horror is manipulative and contrived. There is enough menace in the actual true story without the need for embellishments. Forest Whitaker is menacing but like everyone else in this movie, way over the top. The whole project feels rushed, corny and incomplete.",/review/rw2298852/?ref_=tt_urv

16 July 2011,sddavis63,4," This Takes Too Many Liberties In Portraying The Stanford Prison Experiment
","The Stanford Prison Experiment was conducted in 1971 by psychologist Philip Zimbardo. It selected a random group of people and divided them into prison guards and prison inmates and then placed them into a recreated prison on the grounds of Stanford University for two weeks basically to see how they would adjust to their new roles. The experiment was controversial and was aborted after only 6 days and its results and methodology are still considered questionable. ""The Experiment"" is a sort-of recreation of that experiment, starring Forest Whittaker as one of the pretend guards and Adrien Brody as one of the pretend prisoners.",/review/rw2298852/?ref_=tt_urv

7 June 2012,StevePulaski,6," You are what you are, and few are willing to change that
","The Experiment is based on that very well known experiment that took place in Stanford University's basement where a mock prison was constructed and twenty-four applicants were divided up and given the vague roles of either a ""guard"" or a ""prisoner."" The motivation? A decent pay cut, around $15 a day (the film counterpart ups the pay to $1,000 a day). Guards were armed with intimidating, militaristic outfits, while the prisoners were ill-equipped with a smock and no underwear. Originally set to be a fourteen day test, the experiment ended after day six due to drastic measures taken by the inmates and guards that could've been fatal. Abuse was common, the issue of inferiority plagued the prisoners until they tried to force a rebellion, and borderline torturous acts were committed by the guards.",/review/rw2298852/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2010,EasyGoinDFW,4," Suspension of disbelief
","This movie was well acted and could have been good. Well, it had Adrian Brody and Forrest Whitaker in it, and they are body wonderful actors. This review has several spoilers in it, so don't read further if you are thinking of seeing this one and want to be surprised.",/review/rw2298852/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2010,MovieMaddis,3," Contrived and slow plot makes for a boring ride to a known end
","The Experiment as you know from the summary is a film about psychological tests performed on everyday citizens put both in the role of prisoner and jailer in a makeshift prison. They are videod and given a regiment of ""normal"" prison life to discover how they will react or change from their principals stated during initial interviews. Sounds interesting but ultimately nothing much happens. We are not invested enough in the character to truly believe they would behave in the manner presented. It follows the expected formula to a tee. Of course the guards power trip, of course the prisoners band together, of course we will need escalating events to bring us to our already predicted conclusion. Brody and Whitaker are great here, they bring as much passion as could be expected. However, their backstories are just not flushed out enough to bring empathy to the portrayals. It was like watching a fight and rooting for the guy you knew was supposed to be good. No one really learns anything about themselves, nor do the events really matter more than the shock value they provide for the screen. Sadly, I thought this could have been much better and while the original doesn't stray too far behind, at least with the relative unknowns in that film, we could connect and believe their struggle.",/review/rw2298852/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2010,zardoz-13,1," Is Mankind On A Higher Evolutionary Scale Than Animals???
","This lackluster sociological study gone wrong poses the perennial question: is mankind higher than animals on the evolutionary scale? ""Prison Break"" writer & director Paul Scheuring argues that mankind is higher on the evolutionary scale because we can correct our problems. Unfortunately, ""The Experiment"" doesn't share so much as a glimmer of ""Prison Break's"" brilliance. Moreover, Scheuring's film constitutes a remake of Oliver Hirschbiegel's Teutonic film ""Das Experiment"" (2001) derived from Mario Giordano's book which was inspired by the notorious real-life Stanford prison experiment. Originally, college students participated in the real Stanford experiment that took place in 1971 and sought to document what would happen if morally conscious people were in a morally ambiguous situation. This claustrophobic yarn is presented in a straightforward fashion, meaning that humor is conspicuously absent from the action, but the gravity of the situation yields few rewards. You'd think with his background in the ""Prison Break"" series that Scheuring should have been more adept with his adaptation, but ""The Experiment"" degenerates rather quickly into a standard issue jailhouse drama that neither leaves you with a good taste in your mouth or a sense of catharsis about its dramatic upheavals. It is clear in retrospect why Elijah Wood withdrew from this debacle after several days of shooting.",/review/rw2298852/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2010,dejan8378,6," Clever, but
","Could've been done more with this one. Interesting story, slowly built, tensed, well portrayed characters (not just the main two), excellent acting (Brody and Whitaker especially), but in the end unfortunately fails to materialize all that in to something more. Apart from the plain ending and unnecessary undeveloped female character, everything else was done right and it is a gripping thriller indeed.",/review/rw2298852/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2011,en_blanche,9," This movie is not about Stanford Prison Experiment.
","Firstly, please let me suggest that this movie is not about Stanford Prison Experiment. It doesn't claim that it presents what happened in 1971 at Stanford' basement. The experiment in this movie was done somewhere else by someone else and it seemed illegal to me. That's the point. Please keep it in mind while watching.",/review/rw2298852/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wow, I loved this movie so much. So you know the storyline. I was interested the whole time. Usually I get bored while watching movies and will play on my laptop or iphone during the movie, but this held my interest completely.

10 November 2010,jbbazot,8," Excellent movie!
","Don't mind the bad review up there, whether you've seen or not the German original version, The Experiment still remains an excellent movie with two great actors (and a great plot): Forrest Whitaker and Adrien Brody. Interesting movie that shows that even if we all pretend to have some kind of moral, we all still remain animals that will bite to defend our pack. Sometimes you watch a 96mn movie and it feels like you were watching The Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston (don't mean this is a bad film, it's just very long), but this one is the total opposite! you'll be annoyed when the credits will appear at the end. Also, if like me you're a bit sick and tired of the current Hollywood buzz which consists to make many spy movies with a huge budget, you will enjoy that film, because it's quite simple, only few rooms needed at location. So the question is: are you a prisoner?",/review/rw2298852/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2010,jaronsinclairduke,1," Awful
","Terrible movie. Frustrating to watch because it contradicts itself the whole way through. A drama that takes all manner of reason and throws it out the door. A group of men band together to pis.s on a guys face?? After what, 2 days of role play?? WT.F?? What kind of idiot story teller... Of course the prisoners lose all of their reason after 24 hours... Don't ever take a long flight across the world in a plane because apparently people go nuts if they are contained for a day. In fact everyone comes up with stupid ideas and no one in the entire crowd seems to notice how stupid it is... I signed up to review this just because it was that bad. I've never written a review but all of you artsy farsty people who vote well on it need to have your faces pis.sed on",/review/rw2298852/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2011,gilligan-11,6," Facile treatment of a complex subject
","This film is an intense portrayal of the human instinct to dominate and control. The opening images of animals and insects in conflict (rams butting heads, a praying mantis consuming a fly, even microorganisms devouring each other) signal the thematic connection to the conflict that plays out in this film—research subjects randomly assigned to roles as prisoners and guards and left to their own devices. The guards are given only a set of five rules they are instructed to enforce, and they are foolishly advised to avoid the use of violence. The devolution of order into chaos is reminiscent of ""The Lord of the Flies"" (and there's even a character who resembles the pathetic Piggy—and shares his unfortunate fate). But the film itself is a bit too facile and loose—there's a good deal of action but little in the way of character development, and the ending arrives violently and abruptly. Even the presence of two Best Actor Oscar winners, Brody and Whitaker, cannot rescue this film from its mediocrity.",/review/rw2298852/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2018,nogodnomasters,8," VERY INTENSE
","This is perhaps a 10-star movie, but the over intensity prevented me ""loving"" this movie to a simply ""liking"" this movie. An experiment in the human psyche is conducted using a prison setting where one third of the participants are guards and two thirds are inmates. They are divided up according to their interview, part of which we get to see as a way to quickly build character. Adrien Brody is a prisoner. He is the ultra liberal atheists. Forrest Whitaker, a religious fellow who believes in absolute right and wrong becomes one of the guards. The two briefly talk and connect prior to the interview process.",/review/rw2298852/?ref_=tt_urv

8 September 2010,Tronic2,7," Hollywood storytelling + a psychological experiment = a mediocre movie
","The Stanford prison experiment was about group dynamics when people were assigned roles of prisoners and guards but the movie only revolves around the two main characters most of the time, with others being almost entirely absent. As group dynamics do not really get into play, they miss many opportunities for personality development, which is what made the actual experiment interesting in the first place.",/review/rw2298852/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2011,eekaeeka,10," The Experiment is flawed, or is it?

21 August 2010,IDTooLong,6," Good concept but never really becomes compelling
","The Experiment has an intriguing premise.
