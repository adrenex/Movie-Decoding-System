2 March 2017,bowmanblue,8," A 'war movie' for modern times
","Not so long ago, all 'war movies' consisted of armies of infantry storming one beach/desert/jungle (delete as applicable). And, to be fair, there was little else that happened in a war. However, in today's high-tech times, 'war' can be fought from the 'comfort' of our own homes (okay, military bases, but how long before our soldiers are allowed to work from home?!). The story here goes that Britain has finally got the intel on a handful of its most wanted terrorists who are amassing in a house in a suburban African district. Should they just use an American-based 'drone' to wipe them out, or is the civilian casualty rate going to be too high? Helen Mirren thinks the former.",/review/rw3769192/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2019,Instant_Palmer,8," Gripping, Tense, Thought-Provoking & HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
","One of the best films centered on the war against terrorism that integrates today's truly amazing military and intelligence technology (highlighting drones and the people who guide them to the identification and surveillance of targets, pinpoint accurate missles, and collateral damage assessments/estimating programs), and the moral, ethical, legal and political conflicts of making such decisions within the ""rules of engagement"" by military and political leaders (and their advisors), that are executed by military, intelligence and field personnel when there is a high-likelyhood of collateral damage.",/review/rw3769192/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2016,Red_Identity,," Engaging, effective, and surprisingly heartfelt.
","It surprised me quite a bit. Political war thrillers have been so overdone, but this one really managed to work by narrowing its scope. With films like this, and real-life disasters that kill dozens of people, it's easy to overlook the importance of every single human life. This film is aiming to remind us of just how significant, and atrocious, times of war are, and rightly so, the film does not come with any easy answers. I loved how the film was completely focused on one single event, and while I can see how some might think it was stretched out too much, I felt like moral and emotional weight of the situation on all of these characters called for it. Maybe I would say that the film gets a bit too sentimental at times (we don't need to be reminded with the many shots of the characters' faces or the music), but for the most part it really works. And oh Aaron Paul, you're just the perfect actor to play characters who are trying to help children.",/review/rw3769192/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2016,ctowyi,9," Unsettling heart-parked-in-your-mouth film
","This is a white-knuckled heart-parked-in-your-mouth ""tick tock"" suspense thriller. Hardly an ounce of fats lined a lean and mean explosive storyline, and this one is going to hit the ""career reset"" button for Gavin Hood (even though his last effort Ender's Game is quite decent).

23 September 2016,Hitchcoc,7," So Many Layers
","I can't see this film as an insider. I don't know enough about the realities of drone warfare. I would be surprised that those chosen to do the jobs would be so indecisive. Either you do the work of finding the worst of the worst and act on it, or you don't do it at all. To be so badly trained for the possibility of dealing with civilian casualties should probably be grounds for never being in this position. I'm not saying there is no room for compassion, but, let's face it, the people they were honing in on we're capable of a thousand times worse activity. The movie is contrived because if the bread salesman had been an emaciated, middle aged woman, I doubt that there would have been hesitation. It pulls at our heartstrings, right. The person I was most fearful for was the man who put his life in danger again and again, using devices to spy on the little compound. But he is also victimized by the filmmaker. He is careless with his remote control device, allowing that little boy to become a nuisance. What is the lesson here? What do we want to do with suicide bombers? Is all life sacred or isn't it? Those are the questions we need to confront.",/review/rw3769192/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2016,cosmo_tiger,9," One of the best movies of the year, I highly recommend this. Makes you think, feel and debate. That's the sign of quality.
","""If Al-Shabab kill 80 people we win the propaganda war. If we kill one they do."" Colonel Katherine Powell (Mirren) has been tracking a terrorist cell for years and finally has found her chance to capture them. After the discover 2 suicide vests in the house the mission changes from capture to kill. Drone pilot Steve Watts (Paul) is about to fire when he sees a young girl in the kill zone. He refuses to fire unless the can assure her safety. This sets off an international dispute as to what to do. This is a great movie. Unbelievably tense and really makes you think and wonder what is the right thing to do. This movie does a really fantastic job of giving two convincing sides of the argument and you really aren't sure what is the right answer. In that sense the movie has to be incredibly realistic. Up until the very end you aren't sure how the movie is going to end up, and that really adds to the tension and the quality of the movie. This is one of those movies that you just want to tell everyone about and make them watch it. Overall, one of the best movies of the year, I highly recommend this. Makes you think, feel and debate. That's the sign of a quality piece of work. I give this an A.",/review/rw3769192/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2018,TheLittleSongbird,8," The new front line
","'Eye in the Sky's' main attraction was not for me the fascinating subject. It was not because of my love for the genre. It was because of the immensely talented cast, Helen Mirren, Alan Rickman, Barkhad Abdi and Aaron Paul have been great and more in other things, with my main reason for seeing 'Eye in the Sky' being Rickman in his final screen role before his ultimely death two years ago from pancreatic cancer (a loss still very deeply felt).",/review/rw3769192/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's really a tough watch and if you are more an entertainment kind of person, this won't be for you. But if you like your tension filmed movie to have a voice, to be critical, to challenge you, to get you to the edge (not only of your seat).

28 June 2019,ma-cortes,7," Gripping and intense film with plenty of intrigue , tension , suspense , twists and turns
","Nail-biting , tense and dark anti-war drama with magnificent acting by all-star-cast , acceptable production design and masterfully realized by the always original and professional Gavin Hood . British Army Colonel Katherine Powell (Helen Mirren) wakes up early in the morning and hears that an undercover British/Kenyan agent has been killed by the Al-Shabaab terrorist group. Powell takes command of a mission to capture three of the ten highest-level Al-Shabaab leaders , who are meeting at a safe-house in Nairobi , and a British couple , among them . Soon their crew gets selected to execute a mission from the Army . From Northwood Headquarters-based fighter pilots turned drone pilots control the bloody terrorists by remote control for 12 hours a day . But these drone raids are different than first-person shooter video games , these are lethal machines to kill . Lt Steve Watts (Aaaron Paul) and Carrie Gershon (Phoebe Fox) are flying the U.S. drone the sky above Nairobi , they are who will ultimately pull the trigger . The risked mission feels wrong because the strikes are executed indiscriminately . But the high staff (Jeremy Northam , Alan Rickman , Laila Robins , Iain Glenn , Michael O'Keefe) are biginning to question the mission. And from somewhere in the U.S. Midwest to pull off the deadly execution . Do they carry out the assignment knowing there will be collateral damage? . They are fighting a war without end .If you never face your enemy, how can you face yourself . The commander is in England. The drone pilot is in America. The terrorist is in Kenya. And the authority to strike is up in the air. Welcome to the new front line. The longer you watch, the less clearly you see.",/review/rw3769192/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2016,planktonrules,10," Intense and gripping....
","As this film was playing, I noticed that so many people in the audience were on the edge of their seats or clutching the person next to them...""Eye in the Sky"" is that gripping. Expertly directed by Gavin Hood (director of the Oscar-winning Best Foreign Language film, ""Tsotsi""), with an excellent story by Guy Hibbert as well as some amazing acting make this one of the best films of the year! Frankly...I was shocked how much I liked this film and the audience also seemed very pleased. This picture will be released widely in the coming weeks and I was fortunate enough to see it at the opening night gala at the Gasparilla International Film Festival in Tampa, Florida. With an opening night movie this good, expectations for the rest of the festival are very high.",/review/rw3769192/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2017,nogodnomasters,10," Never tell a soldier he does not know the cost of war
","This is one of several films that have come out about the use of drone missiles and the collateral damage that they cause. This one is by far superior to the lot due to the strong cast. In this production, the setting is Somalia. Their ability to arrest was lost and now they are desperate to take out high level targets that include both US and British citizens. As a recruit puts on a vest, a little collateral damage girl, who thinks math is hard, is just outside.",/review/rw3769192/?ref_=tt_urv

10 April 2016,Quinoa1984,8," memorable for its performances and its gray-area stance on moral terpitude
","Is it right to use a drone attack to shoot a bomb onto people? What if they're planning a terrorist attack that could kill a hundred people, or more? You may argue that it's better to capture them than to kill them, but most people would be fine with taking them out, no big loss for the innocents of the world they'll destroy. OK, fine. What about those surrounding the blast? Call it collateral damage and call it a day, or what if the moral implications actually, you know, stick with you? Eye in the Sky takes what may be to some a big of a cheap shot with this issue: the filmmakers set up the story of a little girl in Somalia (who also happens to have a father/family situation that is not fanatical, and there's a scene that makes sure we the audience know that) who has to sell bread on the street. Turns out she's selling bread right outside of the house where a major terrorist (actually a few) are preparing for a suicide-bombing attack. We know this because the characters in various military positions - the pilot who will pull the trigger from a Nevada base (Aaron Paul), the officer who has been tracking the terrorists for months (Helen Mirren), and her superiors (the late Alan Rickman among others) who have to make the call as British and American super-powers. Strike and deal with the (possible) death of a little girl, or let them go and deal with the, shall one say, 'propaganda' problems in having people die by the terrorists and that those in power knew about it.",/review/rw3769192/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2016,david-meldrum,8," Complex, tense and true
","A few months after my friend was murdered by terrorists in a Kenyan shopping mall, I was watching TV. It was Homeland; there came a moment in the episode I found myself relaxing with that one evening where a character has a lead on a likely opportunity to kill a terrorist who was in the early stages of planning an atrocity. He pulls up alongside the terrorist's car on his motorbike, ready to bomb the vehicle. As he does so, he becomes aware of a problem, someone in the terrorist's car who is not supposed to be there. A child. He rides alongside the car for a while, caught in a terrible moment of indecision. Eventually he rides away, the opportunity untaken.",/review/rw3769192/?ref_=tt_urv

10 May 2016,ahassan-12342,6," Nail-biting drama... But the film's morality is more dubious than it recognises
","Director Gavin Hood's previous film, the underrated Ender's Game, focused upon the increasingly virtual, high-tech surveillance and disengaged nature of modern warfare. These elements of Ender's Game are clearly visible in the director's latest thriller offering, Eye in the Sky. The story here involves disparate groups of military and political personnel scattered around the world, all watching the live stream of a terrorist compound in Nairobi and debating whether or not to fire a drone into a heavily-populated ethnically Somali suburb of the Kenyan capital.",/review/rw3769192/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2018,theovosse,9," Intention vs. reality
","Great movie that doesn't have to rely on tons of CGI to sustain interest. Instead, there is just a handful of characters, and they discuss about consequences. It's a discussion that won't happen in reality, of course, but the characters represent the different viewpoints in the drone killing process, and they do it very well. As another comment said: you have never seen a Skype call this gripping. This is great cinematography.",/review/rw3769192/?ref_=tt_urv

9 May 2016,amoore-4,4," Starts well, then lectures, then bores...
","This film has talented star power and an interesting premise, albeit this type of film has already been done, but where it fails is the inaction by Aaron's character and his unwillingness to follow orders. His actions challenge a direct order, and in real life scenario under these circumstances this would not happen.. he would be removed. It becomes a moral lecture on when it's right to take a life. The movie could easily have been a one hour show but it spends too much time debating and discussing the 'hit', all because a little girl is in danger. I mean, gimme a break... there are seriously bad people conspiring in the building in question and can be taken out with a accurate strike from the drone. ",/review/rw3769192/?ref_=tt_urv
