20 October 2018,SpankyWardOnAmazonPrime,10," More addictive than chocolate.
","I should have been in bed 5 hours ago but I can't stop watching the new chapter of the Avery Saga. The miscarriage of justice is frighteningly insurmountable. Being a screenwriter, if this were a movie I was going to write, I would never have been able to use this plot. I wouldn't have believed an audience would accept such a series of ludacris events like the mishandling and planting of evidence, unethical prosecutorial actions and the total and complete lack of ability to self examine their actions, due to fear. Fear because they've fully committed to their guilty story and if found innocent, how bad they'll look.",/review/rw3820060/?ref_=tt_urv

24 October 2018,moway1114,10," Get ready to change your mind.
","As a rule I do not believe much of what I see on TV or the news for that matter, but part 2 changed it all for me . This series was thought provoking,filled with intrigue and at times terrifying.The thought that this kind of witch hunt can still happen and does happen with more regularity than I would like to admit,is a horrifying reality. Part 1 made me sit up and listen...part 2 left no doubt. If you were on the fence about part 1,watch part 2. Kathleen Zellner rips apart the prosecutions case; step by step,point by point, with real science,a team of REAL experts and an unstoppable need to expose the corruption,seek out the truth and bring attention to the gross violation of human rights. How is that for a run on sentence?! I could not catch my breath while writing this...I felt the same way watching it.",/review/rw3820060/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2018,thomassmith74,10," 2+2=5. Orwell was right.
","This is an incredible documentary. There is no doubt that Steven Avery was framed by the police in order to prevent the $36M law suit. I wonder how long this will go on until the State of Wisconsin admits to the unbelievable injustice of Avery and the corruption of its officers. This also proves how much power lies in the State and how they really can do whatever they want, and how they control all authorities across it's jurisdiction.",/review/rw3820060/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2018,a_biltagi,10," OMG!
","This documentary is insane! The best true crime documentary out there. It purely sheds light on the TRUTH of this nightmare of a case. Its infuriating to say the least. The American criminal justice system is SO corrupt, twisted, and flat out wrong for convicting Steven and Brenden to life for a crime they did not commit. EVERYONE needs to watch this documentary and be angry at how they were 100% framed.",/review/rw3820060/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2018,eogeaux,10," Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse
","This documentary is incredible. It may seem a bit one sided but if you look at the list of people at the end who declined to be interviewed you will see why. You can't begrudge the producers for the other side not cooperating. That being said, the outcome is not very surprising. If you've paid any attention to America's justice system ..... ever ....you would understand that cops and judges are above the law and they can do whatever they want and they have zero accountability. This series just solidified that. Everyone is going to act angry and appalled but then never actually do anything about it. And it will continue and the ""good ol' boys"" will continue trampling on our basic ""freedoms and liberties."" Yay USA!! *insert exaggerated eye roll here*",/review/rw3820060/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2015,Thomas_from_CA,10," Haunting; Unbelievable
","It's hard to put into words how moving this documentary series was. The view of this work from 30,000 feet is perhaps that it is a beautiful but tragic depiction of the powerful versus the powerless in the context of the American criminal justice system, and a haunting reminder of what human beings are capable of when we believe the ends justify the means. The view on the ground - from a very intimate front row seat in Steven Avery's hometown of Manitowoc, WI - is that one man likely endured not one, but two of the most egregious injustices imaginable.

16 November 2018,dinadavis-99505,9," Are the Authorities watching the same confession tapes as we are?
","I've been binge watching this and I'm halfway thru season 2 and all I can say is I'm thoroughly disgusted with the cops, prosecutors, judges, jurors all of them. All one needs to do is watch the very 1st time Brendan's so-called confession tape was aired in the series! That CHILD had NO CLUE what the interrogators were talking about nor what they wanted him to say. This boy was, no IS so innocent, that when they started their LEADING questions regarding ""what happened around her head area""...after a long bout of silence he responds quote: ""I CUT HER HAIR?"". That is how innocent and non-violent Brendan is. That the first thing he could think of ON HIS OWN was a freaking HAIRCUT!!! Those interrogators were SO frustrated by his obvious lack of knowledge of what happened to the poor woman that they announced for all of us to see THAT THEY TOLD HIM she was shot in the head. Haircut to a Bullet in the Brain. Despicable. Wisconsin is full of corrupt cops, prosecutors, state attorneys, forensic analysts, and judges...in at least TWO COUNTIES. SHAME ON YOU!",/review/rw3820060/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2018,xtinec-nyc,10," Great doc movie
",It is shocking to see how justice system was so twisted and it really disgusts me to see those shameless disgusting faces from police dept. It is a great film and I truly admire the team who documentaried the film and the lawyers who had courage and wisdom to defend Steven Avery. Although i was truly devastated when I saw the result and it's so depressing to see Avery's family had to suffer from all this non sense. It is so sad and disappointing to know how ugly this reality is.,/review/rw3820060/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2022,JoeKulik,10," What A Clueless Family !!!
","After viewing both Parts 1 & 2, I see the Avery family as basically honest hard working people, but they seem Incredibly Naive as well. I would even call them Clueless. When I first heard of this case in 2005, my immediate reaction was how Dumb poor Steven Avery was to continue living in the same county where he was wrongfully convicted, and the fact that he was pursuing a $33 Million lawsuit against the county at the same time made it seem Even More Dumb. The man obviously made himself a target for a police agency who he already knew to be corrupt.",/review/rw3820060/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2015,kiss_fans,10," This is one important documentary
","This is one important documentary. This shows just how wrong the justice system is in America. Im from Sweden and did not know anything prior to this series. But If you have - like me, been reading and seeing other documentaries of this kind. You know this have happened several times. It makes me sick. When it comes to Brendan and his statement I immediately started to think about Jessie Misskelley. A boy with below average IQ and was one of three teenagers that got falsely accused of murdering three young boys in Memphis. He also made a ""confession"" after the cops had lured and guiding him towards what they wanted to hear. Anyway, I hope that one day, the truth will come out and the ones, that still walks free, get the judgement they deserve and that Brendan and Steven Avry will get their freedom back. This is something everyone should see. If I were a parent I would show it to my kids, if I was a teacher I would show it to my students. I will recommend it to everyone I know.",/review/rw3820060/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2018,elliotjeory,8," Season 2 review
","Just as fascinating as the first. You want to finish it as soon as you start it to get all the information which makes it compelling viewing. The contributions from Steven's lawyer and Brendan's lawyers are the most interesting and there is a different theory to the murder that wasn't in the first one.
It is also interesting to watch the timeline of events in Brendan's appeals and see the tricks prosecutors played in sealing their conviction. As for the alternative theory it makes you think and doubt the official explaination and it's up to you to draw your own conclusion but it makes a good series to watch and I highly recommend it.",/review/rw3820060/?ref_=tt_urv

21 December 2015,Michael-Hallows-Eve,9," One of the Best documentary series you'll ever see!
","I've watched many Documentary TV series, I've seen 'The Jinx' and 'Paradise Lost' series, and this has to be as good, if not better. I've not been so wild, surprised, annoyed and upset over a TV show like this in years. What Steven Avery and his family goes through is amazing. I knew that some police departments in the U.S have 'questionable' tactics, and after seeing the 'Paradise Lost' series you see that, but you really do hope it's not a common thing. But then you see shows like this one, and it really makes you wonder, how systemic is it in some of the State Police departments? And if this is just one other example of it, how many other times have other Police Departments gotten away with doing this? How many innocent people are in jail right now? Then add to that the privatization of the prison systems, meaning they have to keep the incarceration rate to near capacity to make their profits, then it makes you wonder how many people have been incarcerated using false evidence or coerced confessions. The judicial system leaves a lot to be desired, I'll say that much. I highly recommend this documentary series. It will leave you flabbergasted, it did that for me. I'll give this a 9.5 out of 10.",/review/rw3820060/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2015,jake_fantom,3," Less than it seems
","I watched all ten episodes of this original Netflix series over the course of two days, which will give you an idea of how immersive and compelling it is. Why the low rating then? Simply because this documentary is not really a search for truth in the case of Steven Avery, now a convicted murderer, than it is a biased presentation of one side of the story — Avery's side. Ten minutes of fact checking after my binge viewing revealed a wealth of damning evidence, along with a disturbing picture of Avery's criminal history, that is nowhere mentioned in the documentary as it attempts successfully to portray him as a railroaded innocent, a victim of police corruption and duplicity. If anything, the documentary does provide an inescapable indictment of the Wisconsin criminal justice system — for that it gets 3 stars. You get a visceral sense of how powerless most indicted nobodies are before a system that is stacked against them. But at the end of the day, this documentary fails in its main task, which is to provide all the pertinent facts, and let viewers draw their own conclusions. For that reason, even though I enjoyed it from beginning to end, I feel it is essentially a waste of time — a slick presentation of a single point of view, with critical facts hidden when they support a different conclusion than the filmmakers clearly started with.",/review/rw3820060/?ref_=tt_urv

","The documentary is absolutely brilliant, the way it tells the story is amazing, that must have been some hard work to sort to some many years of story and make it compelling and easy to see. I do not know if it's biased or not as i do not knew this story prior to watching the show. Regarding the content, i felt sick, revolted, upset, amazed, astonished. How can this be real live? How can this be real on a developed country? This seems like some third world justice. I really thing i should never have watched it in the first place, my live would be better without it, ignorance is bliss.",/review/rw3820060/?ref_=tt_urv
