16 January 2018,PaxtonMalloy,7," A fine movie with murhphy as its heart and soul
","I usually write those reviews for ""extreme"" reasons. If everybody hated a movie and I didn't. Or the other way round. Turns out there is another reason. When an actor who was once a star ""comes back"" with a stellar performance. Mr. Church is that film.",/review/rw4526411/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2018,slightlymad22,," Excellent Performance From Murphy In A Movie Worth Coming Out Of Retirement For
","Continuing my plan to watch every Eddie Murphy movie in order, I come to his last movie to daye, Mr Church (2016)",/review/rw4526411/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2021,HotToastyRag,9," Very lovely, unfairly criticized
","Normally, I criticize movie previews for either spoiling the story or misrepresenting the genre, but if you watch the preview for Mr. Church, you'll get a pretty good idea of what it's about. You'll see teenager Britt Robinson and her mother, Natascha McElhone living alone in California in the 1960s. You'll see Britt's shocked reaction when she wakes up one morning to find Eddie Murphy, a total stranger, cooking breakfast in the kitchen. You'll find out he was hired to be their cook, and you'll guess that he eventually wins Britt's trust and affection. If you like the preview, you'll like the movie.",/review/rw4526411/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2016,subxerogravity,8," Wow! When was the last time Eddie Murphy was in a movie this good!?
","I went to my local theater and saw a poster for Mr. Church, with Eddie Murphy's face as big as day on it. Never even herd of this movie and the lack of campaigning from anywhere was strange for me as I sill feel Murphy has that movie star status, but he chooses to do this very quiet under the radar film, that's totally worth seeing.",/review/rw4526411/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2017,nogodnomasters,10," Who wouldn't want a cook?
","Marie Brooke (Natascha McElhone) had an affair with Richard, a wealthy married man. Upon his death he gave his cook, Mr. Church (Eddie Murphy) a stipend to take of Marie and her child Charlie (Natalie Coughlin/Britt Robertson) as Marie was dying from breast cancer in 1971 LA. Mr. Church has a private life he prefers not to share as the film jumps to 1977.",/review/rw4526411/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2019,dmdcheney,8," Sweet and authentic
","Mr. Church is sweet and authentic from the first word to the last. It is well-paced and devoid of drag with steller performances turned out by all players. Mr. Church demonstrates that while we may be on a linear path from birth to death, within that trajectory are full circle loops taking us from one gestalt to the next. It reminds us too how we make a difference in the lives of others and they in ours. Mr. Church was Eddy Murphy's movie to deliver and that he did. Unlike books which are meant to be read from beggining to end, sometimes the stories are better understood when we start from the end and work our way back.",/review/rw4526411/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2017,TxMike,," Very nice, quiet drama based on real people, Eddie Murphy shines as Mr. Church.

24 March 2018,redkrypto-16659,10," Loved it!!
",Do not want to give away any spoilers here. Just have to say that this movie is absolutely beautiful. Bravo Eddie Murphy and entire cast. Kept my wife and I on the verge of tears for the duration. Just beautiful! Thanks!!,/review/rw4526411/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2018,classicsoncall,7," ""He was like the moon - cool, calm, and always there.""
","My best takeaway from the film is that it's not only possible, but probably occurs more often than one usually would consider, that a healthy relationship along biracial lines can exist on the order of ""Mr. Church"". Having mentioned that though, I did find it odd that through all the circumstances that Mr. Church (Eddie Murphy) and the Brooks's were engaged in, no one came across with a snide remark or was derisive in any way. Especially when Charlie (Britt Robertson) wound up living with him during and after her pregnancy. It seemed like pains were taken by the filmmakers to specifically avoid racial situations that could have blown up due to intolerance or simple ignorance.",/review/rw4526411/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2016,peterp-450-298716,7," Eddie Murphy's surprising come-back in a predictable tearjerker.

31 December 2016,aharmas,10," Murphy's Tour De Force
","Somehow I missed this one when it came out earlier this year, but I finally caught it, right before year's end, and I'm so happy and grateful that this movie was made. It goes back to the golden days when a story was told with plenty of heart, introducing to complete characters whom we cared about. More importantly, there's no second guessing, no long shots of morose, bitter creations. When we see any part of ""Mr. Church"", we are looking through a window that shows people like you and me, with dreams, emotional burdens, with hope, loving and hate life. It tells that there's room in life to give yourself a second chance; that there will be a second chance somehow because at the heart of all that is good in life, there's love.",/review/rw4526411/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2016,Gordon-11,," A touching portrait of an extraordinary man
","This film tells the story of a man who is hired for six months to take care of a woman with cancer and her young daughter. His job is to cook for them, yet he goes way beyond his duties and touches the lives of people around him.",/review/rw4526411/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2016,Reno-Rangan,10," People come together for a reason, but stay together for no reason.
","According to me this film was silently made. I mean we only anticipate big production films and current famous director, actors' films, particularly the science fiction and superhero films as they are the trend now. The promotion begins from the day it was announced. So I did not realise when this one started to come to exist. But when I did come to know, all I know was it is an Eddie Murphy's film and I should give it a try. Because I felt like I haven't seen him for a decade.",/review/rw4526411/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2017,arizona-43561,10," Best Heartfelt Movie in a very long time
","Best heartfelt movie I have seen in a long time. Hollywood finally got it right. This is the kind of movie that hardworking people want to see. Not the trash at theater's now days. Great messages, one will experience all feelings and, yes, people can be friends. Eddie Murphy is excellent in this role.",/review/rw4526411/?ref_=tt_urv

24 October 2016,cosmo_tiger,10," One of the best movies of the year and easily Murphy's best movie since Coming to America. I highly recommend this.
","""I was your cook. That's all you need to know."" Charlie (Robertson) wakes up one day and finds Mr. Church (Murphy) cooking in the kitchen. He is there to help her mother, who has cancer. Charlie is not happy he is there and does everything she can to make his life miserable. Little by little she comes around and she realizes that through all of her ups and downs of life only one person was there for her. I have been a huge Eddie Murphy fan forever and was looking forward to watching this. His first movie in about 5 years and his first straight out drama lead role. I was not disappointed at all. Murphy is pretty much the perfect choice for this role. He really adds something to the character that not many actors can do just be being themselves. The movie does have some swearing in it, but nothing over the top and is appropriate. I say that because this is one of the best family movies I have seen in a long time. A great message movie for kids and something adults can enjoy as well. Be warned, this is not your typical Eddie Murphy movie and me and my kids all cried a little bit. That is the sign of a good movie to me. One that makes you feel and care. Overall, one of the best movies of the year and easily Murphy's best movie since Coming to America. I highly recommend this. I give it an A+.",/review/rw4526411/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2016,kenfromcanada,7," Yes - a good movie, actually - a VERY good movie
","I guess I have come full circle when it comes to Eddie Murphy movies. It was 1984, I was a newly wed and Eddie was a slightly racy movie star, but, perfect for a couples evening at the cinema! And we cried with laughter. I would never have believed that some 30 plus years later I would be watching an Eddie Murphy movie and crying in a different way. This is a fairly simple movie, easy to follow, no special effects, just the type of movie Hollywood used to do so well. I guess there is still hope. Along with Eddie there are a couple of known actors,no spoiler alert - but Eddie has aged very well! Full circle - I watch movies on my own now..",/review/rw4526411/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2016,sheldog-57864,10," Excellent movie
","I am so sad that this movie hasn't been advertised like other movies. I happen to find it on a whim. In this crazy world, this movie helps you remember that there are still good people who truly care, who are selfless. Eddie Murphy deserves an Oscar and so does the movie. I wasn't familiar with the young lady who acted with him. The character Charlotte",/review/rw4526411/?ref_=tt_urv

","I don't know how this this wonderful masterpiece slipped by me back in 2016 or why it wasn't more widely known, but am so glad I ran across it by accident.
The story of love, loss, growing up, death, dying, and how we touch other peoples lives is inspirational.
