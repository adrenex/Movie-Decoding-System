24 November 2016,eddie_baggins,8," Keaton shines in this fascinating biopic
","For many the thought nowadays of takeaway food is but a convenience we all enjoy (some more than others) but at one stage during human history the very idea of having your burger, fries and ice-cold Coke ready in mere seconds was a novelty that began sweeping the nation of America before taking over the world as we now know it today.

26 November 2016,CineMuseFilms,8," A tale of treachery, greed and a code of ethics toxic enough to spoil a Big Mac.
","Biographical dramas tell stories about significant people in history but they are always much more than that. The person chosen for the bio-pic reflects something about the values of the era and the society from which they came. In this sense, The Founder (2016) goes well beyond the story of a global hamburger empire to the values that made McDonald's possible and it does not paint a pretty picture. The mantra ""persistence is everything"" is heard at the beginning and the end of this film but when decoded it means persistent treachery, greed, and a code of ethics toxic enough to remove some gloss from the world's most recognised golden arches.",/review/rw6050441/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2017,RforFilm,9," The Founder is the McDonalds version of There Will Be Blood...and I'm lovin it
","When somebody like myself can describe their childhood as always remembering the golden arches from the McDonalds, I don't know whether to describe this memory as sad, like an imprinted advertisement, or simply American. Regardless of the opinion of their food, McDonalds is the standing example of the American dream, both for the consumer and the businesspeople. For a typical family, they have the option of forgoing the hard work of cooking in favor of having hamburgers in a short time (I never said it's a good thing, just an option). For the entrepreneur, McDonalds is more then just a restaurant; it's a success story of an American company that has gone global. ",/review/rw6050441/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2017,ferguson-6,7," Kroc took their lunch money
","Greetings again from the darkness. How you define success will likely determine your interpretation of this film that is every bit as much about the humble beginnings and explosive growth of McDonalds as it is a biopic of Ray Kroc, the self-professed ""founder"" of the golden arches empire. Capitalism and its corresponding businessmen have not typically been favorably portrayed by Hollywood in such films as The Social Network, Wall Street, Glengarry Glen Ross, Steve Jobs and The Wolf of Wall Street. This latest from director John Lee Hancock (Saving Mr. Banks, The Blind Side) and writer Robert Siegel (The Wrestler) is no exception, and it's obvious why.",/review/rw6050441/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2016,sol-,7," Fast Food Nation
","Based on the true story of Ray Kroc, a traveling salesman who franchised the first family-owned McDonald's restaurant and turned it into the international conglomerate that it is today, 'The Founder' tells a fascinating slice of twentieth century history. The title is well chosen, hinting at the dynamic at the heart of the film with Kroc declaring himself the ""founder"" of McDonald's when in fact the idea of fast and efficient food service was never his to begin with - something that becomes a point of contention with the original owners. Michael Keaton is excellent in the lead role, exuding both charm and charisma while also always coming off as if he has something up his sleeve. There are several great shots throughout that linger on his face in close-up as he delivers persuasive sales pitches and there is a magnificent sequence late in the piece where several of his sermons in different locations are edited together to overlap as one big speech. Keaton also does well coming off as both victim and aggressor at varying points. At times, he comes across as an all-too-sympathetic underdog whose dreams are hindered by the McDonalds brothers' unwillingness to compromise in the name of progress. At other points, he seems insanely ruthless with how he circumvents everything in his way. Telling a similar slice of contemporary history, 'The Founder' is bound to be compared to 'The Social Network', to which it does not stack up as well, but it deserves to be considered as a film on its own. The storytelling approach here is more comedic than in the Facebook film and while 'The Founder' may have benefited from even more comedy to lighten the mood, it is an amusing film as it is - and a thought-provoking film when considers its basis in actual fact.",/review/rw6050441/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2017,planktonrules,8," Well made but a tough sell since the central figure is difficult to like.
","""The Founder"" is a well made and interesting movie. The filmmakers had so much faith in the film that they counted on it being Oscar bait....and were apparently shocked that it didn't receive a single nomination. Why? Well, I'd bet that the film has one fatal flaw that prevented it from being better received...the central character to the story, Ray Kroc, was not an easy man to like. Selling a film that exposes him as a rather cut-throat businessman probably left more than a few people cold when the film ended.",/review/rw6050441/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2016,MrDHWong,8," An interesting look into the way one man helped turn a small hamburger restaurant into a global fast food empire
","The Founder is a biographical drama film starring Michael Keaton based on the life of American businessman and founder of the McDonald's Corporation Ray Kroc. Whether you love the McDonald's brand or hate it, this film offers a compelling view into the way it has captivated us all with its worldwide presence.",/review/rw6050441/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2018,cricketbat,7," I simultaneously respect and dislike Ray Kroc
","The Founder is a fascinating and frustrating story about a man (and a restaurant chain) that you simultaneously respect and dislike. Michael Keaton becomes Ray Kroc, and this film makes you realize how revolutionary the concept of McDonald's really was. It may have made my wife want to boycott the Golden Arches for a while, but it's still a well-made movie.",/review/rw6050441/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2017,AlsExGal,8," Who would think a film about McDonald's would be this interesting?
","I was actually surprised when it was over, because the movie had gone by so fast. Who knew a film about McDonald's would be this interesting? Of course Michael Keaton has no problem diving into the character of wheeler dealer Ray Kroc. His perfect foil is Nick Offerman as Dick McDonald, deadpan, a solid rock of a man with strong ideas about integrity. John Carroll Lynch as Mac McDonald, Dick's brother, a taller but more accommodating man, is also outstanding. Linda Cardinelli as Joan Smith, eventually to be Joan Kroc, is quite lovely and looks good in the period costumes. At the end of the film Kroc offers what are now, I believe, called ""alternative facts"" about the founding of McDonald's. The film is very much about two different visions of America as reflected in two different approaches to business.",/review/rw6050441/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2018,Leofwine_draca,10," Nearly as good as The Social Network
","THE FOUNDER is a film much like Fincher's THE SOCIAL NETWORK: a business-based biopic that sounds rather dull on the page, but which turns out to be spellbinding when on the screen. It's a tale looking at the inception and growth of McDonald's in the 1950s in the hands of the ruthless salesman Ray Kroc, who saw potential in a small business and made it into the franchise it is today. The film is lengthy but perfectly made with just the right pace, and the acting from the principal players is exemplary: Michael Keaton is fully enjoying his career renaissance and as good as he was in SPOTLIGHT, while John Carroll Lynch brings the same heart to the film as he did to FARGO. As with THE SOCIAL NETWORK, this turns out to be less about business and success than about the human capacity for greed and ruthlessness, and man's ability to step on his fellow man in order to reach the top of the ladder. It's remarkably engaging.",/review/rw6050441/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2017,CANpatbuck3664,9," The Founder Provides a Nourishing and Well Balanced Movie Going Experience
","Sometimes it kind of sucks loving movies and living in a small town. I wanted to see this as soon as I saw the trailer but it was only available in a limited release. So I had to wait for the expansion in the release after the new year came around. So I made the trip up to a larger city with a couple of good friends to get the chance to go see it. I walked away from the theatre impressed with the movie and glad I made the trip. The Founder could have taken the easy route, painting Ray Kroc as the cartoon villain but the movie rises above that and shows us a balanced and unflinching look at the creation and expansion of the McDonald's brand.",/review/rw6050441/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2017,Jessica-katz5,8," Heartbreaking
","Really don't even know how to review this movie. Acting was superb, but content makes me sick. I give this a 1 on storyline alone. Ray Kroc was a scumbag of the highest order, in a class all his own. My heart breaks for the McDonald Brothers who were steamrolled, manipulated, and who had their livelihood utterly destroyed by this cunning, ruthless, and I'm convinced, sociopathic man. Especially with the notes at the end how they never received one dime in royalties. This story will really make you hate McDonald's.",/review/rw6050441/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2016,sossevarvo,7," A solid biopic made worth seeing for Keaton
","The Founder is another tale of the American Dream. It's the kind of tale we've seen a million times before. American man wants to become successful, sacrifices morality for moolah, etc. It's The Godfather, it's The Social Network, it's The Wolf of Wall Street. And The Founder, while entertaining, offers pretty much nothing new, or distinctive, to contribute. It is directed fairly conventionally, the story hits all the beats you'd expect, and it's not going to stick to your memory for too long. ",/review/rw6050441/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2017,rockman182,7," The Founder (2017)
","This film is not really what you expect it to be. Upon first glance at the trailer you would think its the story of the founder of McDonalds who comes from nothing and works hard to start a global fast food chain. That's really not what this was about. I would say this film is quite unique; I never expected the roots of a popular fast food chain to get a film. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued to see the film though. Overall, I'd say its a mixed bag with a stronger first section than second.",/review/rw6050441/?ref_=tt_urv

","I saw this film back in 2016 when it first got released, but am just now reviewing it. This movie is awesome, it explains the fall and rise and fall and rise and fall and rise of ""McDonalds."" This movie is one of the movies that started my love and passion for movies, every single time I have a McDonalds burger now, I want to watch this movie. The acting is beautiful from start to finish, Michael Keaton gives one of his best performances in this film, and Nick Offerman, holy crap he can act, when I first saw the movie, I had no idea that was him because I had recently finished watching Parks and Rec. but Nick Offerman definitely showed us how good he is at acting. The story is beautiful from start to finish, the script is so well written and the cinematography is just great, really makes you feel like you are back in the 1950s. This movie actually created one of my life long dreams, and that's to have an original McDonalds hamburger, because I sure as hell know that it doesn't taste the same nowadays.",/review/rw6050441/?ref_=tt_urv
