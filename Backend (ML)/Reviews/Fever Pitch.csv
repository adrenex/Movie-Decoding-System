24 January 2023,kevin_robbins,7," This is a worthwhile addition to the horror genre that's worth watching once
",Sick (2022) is a movie that I recently watched on Peacock. The storyline follows a group of friends who decide to quarantine at a family cabin to isolate themselves and have a good time while they do it. Some uninvited friends arrive ruining their party and threatening their safe space.,/review/rw8840426/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,IonicBreezeMachine,7," John Hyams and Kevin Williamson deliver a minimalist and bloody good time with this Covid era slasher
","Set during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, college students and friends Parker Mason (Gideon Adlon) and Miri Woodlow (Bethlehem Million) head out to Miri's parents lakeside house to ride out quarantine.

","There's been a few horror films post Covid that address the insanity of the time. To be fair: no one got it right and in the future we will get movies mocking these times and this one got it right, with a slasher twist.",/review/rw8840426/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2023,Xstal,6," Coughs & Sneezes Spread Deceases...
","There's a lockdown and it's time to quarantine, so with Miri you locate to a new scene, a plush cabin by a lake, a great place to take a break, put your feet up 'til routine can reconvene. An uninvited guest, knocks on the door, he's a friend you find it tricky to ignore, so he joins the isolation, and then demonstrates frustration, you retire for the night, not wanting more. Alas, a good night's sleep's not on the cards, as the silence is soon broken, the quiet jarred, an aggressive strain makes entry, most resistant and unfriendly, and the antidote will leave you deeply scarred.",/review/rw8840426/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,honest_reviews17,8," Scream Meets COVID
","This was one of the best American slasher films in recent years! Set in the height of ""COVID masking"" times, it's full of intensity and plenty of blood. It's definitely worth watching if you enjoy Scream type movies. The only part I found awkward was how some of the COVID discussion seemed to stick out as lacking the sort of ""punch"" it was probably intended to have. Villan(s) don't always need to explain every last detail about their motivations or backgrounds, but this seems to be a trend which this movie also followed. Nonetheless, a great experience overall! Enjoyed the haunting soundtrack as well.",/review/rw8840426/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2023,tikitim-47092,8," Finally a great slasher film!
","There are some movies you know 5 minutes going into it that it's going to be worth the while. This was such a movie. The beginning was suspenseful out of the gate and had me looking away. Great action, scary, decent acting and the kind of slasher that I would gladly see a sequel of. It had me jump several times and was just generally creepy. It actually had a similar feel to Scream which I love. It had also a sense of realism that this could actually happen that I appreciated. The characters actually did semi-intelligent things as opposed to just plain stupid decisions. It didn't insult the viewers intelligence. Finally I really liked the homage to the whole period of lock down COVID. There were a few parts that actually had me laughing because of how ridiculous and paranoid the first days of lockdown were for people. They need to make more slashers like this that are truly scary from beginning to end. Keep them coming!",/review/rw8840426/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,travisvincent,8," Tight and Effective
","SICK is a horror movie of the slasher kind. It's delivers all the effective elements one needs in a slasher movie, hitting all the marks and checking off all the boxes. While not terribly a scary movie, it is tight and tense. SICK give you the standard girls in distress while adding a COVID theme behind it.",/review/rw8840426/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,cardsrock,6," Scream meets Hush meets.... Fauci?
","Movies like this live or die based on the decisions of the protagonists and while the ones in this film make some decent decisions, as the movie progresses they become increasingly dumb. It's a shame because there are some effective thrills and a solid premise here.",/review/rw8840426/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,QuodNomenMihiEst,5," just ok
","Decent movie that adds nothing new to the genre. It had decent performances with somewhat likable characters. Great location shooting and sets. Also, it really picks up in the second act, not much in the sense of dread or fear, but it at least avoided drowning the audience with lame jump scares. As for the covid part of the plot, hated it. No matter which side you fall on, you'll find yourself rolling your eyes. Some here have claimed the this takes aim at ""anti-vaxxers,"" but make no mistake, it takes shots at both sides and even hits the target on a few occasions. In any case, as silly as the overall plot is, it's still somewhat enjoyable due to the second half of the movie. Worth a watch.",/review/rw8840426/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,icebrg313,1," So so so so bad
","This movie actually started out ok. It built up some tension right from the get go. They also added a big dose of satire towards COVID-19 hysteria and masking which was funny for awhile. Sadly though, the plot devolved into every horror movie cliche and jump scare. I knew every lame twist that was coming and the COVID jokes got ridiculous. This is one of those movies where the characters are so dumb you actually WANT them to die. I couldn't wait for it to be over. It's so sad that they failed to finish the film without making it into a joke. Maybe it was all a joke. I'm not really sure at this point. I think the joke's on me.",/review/rw8840426/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,Joeyseph,3," If you're only watching this because of Kevin Williamson... don't.
","This movie was just bad. The COVID plot was bad, the characters were boring, the motive was dumb (even though it -sort of- made sense from the killers' psychotic mindset.)",/review/rw8840426/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2023,edoster19,2," Would be 1.8
",This is the dumbest movie I have seen in a while. She could have tried using the computer for 20 minutes. She could have popped a hole in the plastic bag. I was not rooting for any of these characters and I had no reason to care what happened to them. The setup was dumb.,/review/rw8840426/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,edw1976,1," Bored
","I wanted to like this based on the critics' reviews, but I was bored almost to sleep. The casting was all wrong. I mean really. Two lil girls running around from grown ass men and the men can't seem to catch them? Not believable that they could pull off the things they did. I found myself just wanting to fast forward to the end. Too generic, and just not gripping.",/review/rw8840426/?ref_=tt_urv

","Blumhouse shouldn't be allowed to market as horror. There should be a whole new rating created for Blumhouse - Under 10s Horror. When your scare moments are limited to cut scenes of blenders mixing up smoothies and electric toothbrushes laving protagonists' teeth, you know you've run out of material; just admit you're making these things for the kids.",/review/rw8840426/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,msvicki1224,1," DUMB, DUMB AND DUMBER!!!!!
","I haven't even watched a full 40 minutes of this trash because it sucks so horribly bad!!!! It started off okay but even the guy in the beginning made some idiotic decisions that I don't think anyone with common sense would make but hey, it's a movie so of course the decisions will be dumb!!!! Who doesn't lock their door after coming home from shopping and etc.???? How stupid could you be to NOT remember to lock your door??? Then the guy named DJ goes out to get his bag from his truck while leaving the door to the house wide open with the two girls inside of the house!!!! LOL That was just too stupid!!!! I already knew that the killer was of course going to walk into the house because DJ invited him in by leaving the door open!!! I turned the movie off after that nonsense!!!! I just couldn't take it anymore!!!! Don't punish yourself, watch a movie that is worth your time!!!!!",/review/rw8840426/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,chrislawuk,9," Post covid horror
","I am glad I watched this one tonight-kinda cheered me up. Should prove popular with people who like horror dark comedy. Its the same old concept, but it works everytime if you reinvent in a novel way. Similar to Scream in many ways, but I thought it was better than any in the Scream series. Its a traditional style of slasher movie, but has enough quirky twists to breathe some new life in to the old genre. Violent, yes, but also funny. These movies were always supposed to be over the top fun, and this one certainly delivers. Its paced well and keeps you routing for the leads. Its cynical satire, but even us most ardent covid regulation followers, need to laugh at our own eccentricism after 3 years of that carry on. An enjoyable one, well for me anway. Maybe i'm sick!",/review/rw8840426/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,gustheaffen,1," Covid Propaganda
",If you want to be reminded of how utterly ridiculous Covid was in 2020 this is the movie for you. Wear your mask! Particularly when hanging out with your friends. This appeared to be a typical slasher story and then hilariously threw in the motive for the mayhem was of course Covid! You are an asymptomatic spreader! Didn't you listen to Fauci and quarantine yourself ALONE! As a result a young person that literally has a .001% chance of dying died and we must seek revenge. They managed to jam in every CDC recommendation. I can't believe anyone likes this. It isn't even subtle anymore when they push their ridiculous agenda.,/review/rw8840426/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,kuner-59029,2," Dull and illogical
","The opening 10 minutes are a pretty decent recreation of Scream's opening. A victim is being stalked and attacked by a masked killer. But this victim, after successfully evading the killer, suddenly does something extremely stupid that no person in their right mind would do. He grabs a baseball bat and leaves his secure hidout to confront a guy with giant hunting knife.",/review/rw8840426/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,killercharm,3," lock down at the manse
","This is a slasher flick with little tension to no scares. During the covid-19 pandemic two besties head out to the lock themselves down at the family vacay-mansion - a stunning log cabin with lots of glass and light. Once we establish that one's sweetheart followed them out we have our good-guys. The attacks can start. There really is nothing to compel one to care about what happens and to whom. By the end of the break-in attacks the story finally becomes enough to command attention. Turns out the attackers are a trio with an agenda that transcends the usual suspects and their usual motives. This crew have ""right"" on their side, which only makes them more dangerous.",/review/rw8840426/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,Mehki_Girl,8," Ignore the ""Woke"" Whiners

17 January 2023,julieshotmail,3," The awesome house and the bit about the mask are the redeeming value
","""Sick"" is pretty awful. The backdrop about COVID is cringe, and the backstory is even more ridiculous. With a backstory this silly, there is absolutely no meaningful plot; for instance, the opening horror sequence is never explained - who is that and why? You can also tell that these are second-rate unknown actors. I am willing to give them a chance, especially the lead, but everyone is bad throughout. They seem to be loaners from the Lifetime Movie Network. But I admit there is a highlight in this movie: that beautiful lake log home. They are not joking around. It is truly spectacular. The other thing that's noteworthy is the funny bit about demanding a mask be worn before entering the car. What a way to tie it into the slasher theme. Now I've learned a valuable lesson of never accepting a mask from a stranger. Bring your own!",/review/rw8840426/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2023,Neptune165,4," Boring slasher. Nothing creative at all. Avoid entirely
","The only memorable thing about this movie is how silly the killers motivations are, once they're revealed. The characters, the kills, it's all so lackluster and will be forgotten after leaving this review. From the ridiculous, cringy Covid references, to the awful acting, to the terribly predictable storyline, I don't understand how anyone could say this is anything but a truly awful movie. I haven't seen a movie this bad in a long time and wish I could have that 80-something minutes back.. It has nice directing, and this newer spin on the home invasion genre brings nice tension and tricks along with it, but it may not be quite enough to keep Sick from still feeling cliché at times and to excuse a reasonably hit or miss closer. - very strong mixed, right below a Pass.",/review/rw8840426/?ref_=tt_urv
