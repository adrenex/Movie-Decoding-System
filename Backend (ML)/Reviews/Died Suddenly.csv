2 July 2012,gilligan-11,8," It's not about the stripping...
","This might come as a shock to some, but this is not really a movie about male strippers. Yes, two of the principal characters are male strippers, but—as Channing Tatum's character (Magic Mike himself) says at a crucial point in the film, ""That's what I do—it's not who I am."" Amid the bountiful buttcheeks and brawny pecs on display, there is a real story here about ambition, and goals, and loyalty, and commitment, and self-actualization. Yes, I used the term ""self-actualization"" in a review of ""Magic Mike""; I told you you might be shocked.",/review/rw2637449/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2012,moviewizguy,9," The law says you cannot touch, but I think I see a lotta lawbreakers up in this house tonight...
","Many people like to generalize things to make it easier to understand the world. When the trailer for MAGIC MIKE was revealed, it was labeled as just a ""male stripper movie,"" like how BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was just a ""gay cowboy movie."" This generic label, undermining and downgrading the film's actual quality, even overshadows the fact that Steven Soderbergh is the director, who rarely make films that lack substance. Yes, MAGIC MIKE has style, but it has substance as well. Here's the kicker: Those who want to see the film primarily for the stripping may be left disappointed, as they will likely fidget in their seats for these scenes to come. As one lady sitting next to me said once the credits rolled, ""Worst movie ever."" On the other hand, those who refuse to see the film because of its subject matter may be missing a great film.",/review/rw2637449/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2012,preppy-3,7," Aside from the stripping there's nothing new here but I was never bored
",This takes place in Florida. A 30 year old male stripper Magic Mike (Channing Tatum) meets young Adam (Alex Pettyfer) who has no direction in life. Mike takes him under his wing and gets him to be a stripper. He also romances Adams' sister Brooke (Cody Horn). But Adam gets hooked on drugs and things get dangerous.,/review/rw2637449/?ref_=tt_urv

30 June 2012,OrsonLannister,4," Schizophrenic: Why ""Magic Mike"" doesn't work
","As I watched ""Magic Mike"", I was entertained and hopeful. Some of its elements were fascinating and the storyline seemed to be heading in an interesting direction. Each new scene seemed to lead toward a climax that could make the movie's run time worthwhile.",/review/rw2637449/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2012,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,9," Way more magic involved than I had presumed
","It really, really boggles my mind just how the brains of so many of you people work. 90% of the reviews on here are exactly the same ""the stripping was the ONLY good thing about the movie"". I couldn't disagree more.",/review/rw2637449/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2012,littlemartinarocena,7," Great buns, shame about the script
","So many elements that could have made this a truly original movie. Instead it's confusing, meandering and ultimately pointless. Alex Pettyfer, the innocent entering the world of male strippers has a good face a great body but lacks life, yes, that's it, he's kind of lifeless. Channing Tatum, whose story, apparently, this is, has a body that seems to have been shaped by a genius, but a face that looks slightly unfinished. I didn't get his character at all. As an actor Channing tries far too hard. Matthew McConaughey is a hoot, Great chest and he seems to be relishing the spotlight. So, all in all, entertaining and little, very little else.",/review/rw2637449/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2014,rooprect,8," Trailer is misleading, great movie though
","The upbeat trailer with quippy banter, cute gags and promises of washboard abs & tight tushies is very misleading. And the IMDb plot summary makes me want to hurl: ""A male stripper teaches a younger performer how to party, pick up women, and make easy money."" ""Magic Mike"" is a great movie but for different reasons and for a different audience than the trailer may attract. It's not a fun & wild romp nor is it a quirky romcom with a lot of chuckles. It's a complex drama that focuses on success vs. the illusion of success. It could've been set on Wall Street. It could've been set in a law firm. It could've been set in any one of the paragons of success that we envision when we hear that word. Instead it's set in a male nudie bar with tons of hormone-raging women waving, hurling and stuffing $1 bills into mens' thong underwear.",/review/rw2637449/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2022,UniqueParticle,10," I'm one of very few that loves this movie!
","Everything about this to me is well directed with great dialogue, smooth scenes and the soundtrack is gold! Steven Soderbergh was perfect for this with the films he's done you can't go wrong. I'm not fully sure what the negativity stemmed from I think Magic Mike is great all around for both genders too. Ever since the movie came on HBO I've seen so many times cause I enjoy most the scenes and I love the song Victim by Win Win that song is brilliant. I'm probably peculiar for being a guy that loves the movie and I disagree with the person that said something about not enough energy that's way wrong.",/review/rw2637449/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2015,lesleyharris30,7," Very Slow Comedy, but brings in Great Laughs and Performances,
","Magic Mike is a good movie with a well developed storyline and an impressive cast. It's an enjoyable movie that brings in many laughs, as well as terrific performances from the entire cast, the chemistry between everyone is great, particularly the parts between Channing Tatum and Cody Horn, they both seemed to really enjoy being in each other's company and their scenes were very natural. It's a really slow movie and can admittedly get very boring at times, there are a lot of very lengthy scenes were the characters are literally just talking, while they are well acted and serve as a great method for character development, they can still get very tedious, they could have easily trimmed a lot of scenes and made it a more bearable ninety minute run. The highlight of the movie is definitely Matthew McConaughey, playing a character unlike one he has ever played before, he is very natural and charismatic in the role of Dallas, his scenes certainly had me entertained the most. It may be very slow, but Magic Milke is still an enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good, easy to watch, comedy if you ever see it on television and had some time to kill.

30 June 2012,MylesEd20,3," Too Long, Boring, and Didn't Have a Real Ending....
","I am going to make my review short, sweet, and to the point. Something Magic Mike was not. As far as the stripping goes and the first hour of the movie, it wasn't that bad. I actually had a good time. When the movie got close to two hours, I along with everyone else in the theater were ready to leave. That being said, I think the writer of the film was also ready to leave... his computer from writing the script, because there was NO ENDING... they kind of sum up two characters and thats it.. for the rest of the cast you spend 2 hours getting to know them, you have no idea if they die from too much crack or if they quit dancing or if they have fun at a new club... there needed to be at least a photo of each character with a small description of what happened to them next... NOT TO GIVE ANYTHING AWAY... but one of the main characters in the movie has a HUGE LIFE ISSUE, and they NEVER SOLVE IT, they give you nothing... just ""WELL THESE TWO PEOPLE ARE HAPPY, THE END""",/review/rw2637449/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2012,bkoganbing,7," A Young Man's game
",Unless you are going to go into the business end of it like Matthew McConaughey does male stripping is definitely for those just entering legal majority and a bit beyond. You get old mighty quick in the game as Channing Tatum in the title role realizes. He's got a day job and he's saving his money to start a business.,/review/rw2637449/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2012,napierslogs,7," The lifestyle of male strippers with characters and dichotomies
","Mike (Channing Tatum) is a stripper. He's also a contractor and furniture business entrepreneur. He's actually a pretty stand-up young man. Adam (Alex Pettyfer) isn't as put together, but his sister wants him to be. So when she ventures out to Xquisite, the all male dance revue, she exclaims ""I was hoping it was all a joke."" I don't blame her, I thought it was too. Mike responds, ""No, but it is pretty funny."" He's also right.",/review/rw2637449/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2021,cardsrock,8," Check your preconceptions at the door
","There is a real film here, contrary to many biased reviewers. A well-told story and assured direction push Magic Mike beyond the stigma it has received. Channing Tatum is a good actor and I won't hear anything to the contrary. He has a real knack for acting casually cool in his roles and his dancing is genuinely impressive. McConaughey also gives a tremendous performance and fully commits to the role. If you're willing to look past the premise, you can find an actually enjoyable film here.",/review/rw2637449/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2012,JadeIslandReviews,3," Magic Mike: Needed More Magic and Less Mike
","Magic Mike is one of those many films that I could guess the plot exactly before I saw it. I don't know if its because its super predictable or if I've seen too many movies. Anyways, here is how I predicted how the film would go down before I saw it: Popular guy with pretty good life turns into a Disney princess because he wants ""something more"" in his life than what he's use to. He meets girl, falls in love with girl but is torn between his life and girl. He (shockingly) picks girl with limited personality instead of pretty good life and they all live happily ever after. That was my prediction BEFORE I saw the movie.",/review/rw2637449/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2012,dharmendrasingh,6," One for the ladies (and gentlemen)
","The usherette tittered when I bought my ticket. 'Why do you laugh?' I asked. 'Because only girls are watching this'. Clearly this is someone who doesn't believe in the universality of cinema. Yes, Steven Soderbergh's latest features male strippers, and yes it will appeal more to a certain demographic, but so will every film. Audiences may be disparate but films are androgynous. Or should be. ",/review/rw2637449/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2012,afertak,4," Too much of one's ego and no director on sight to take hold on it:(
","Well, well, well... I went on to see it thinking ""You can't just get enough of pretty naked men"". As it appeared I was wrong. First of all: although Channing Tatum here actually played his part instead of just being on the screen, I've had too much of his ego after first 40 minutes. Second: none of the cast, except for Matt McConaughey and Matt Bomer, was visible enough to create a full-blooded character. I will not mention their bad preparation, because I can't believe that you cannot teach Joe Manganiello how to dance. And third: it is really sad not to see the director's work. It seems like no one red the script to notice how bad it was, when it comes to structure and building characters. I got an impression that for some, money and wild party were the only reason to take part in this project. As far as I'm concerned, I'd like to see more of ""Let's make a good film"" attitude rather than purely ""Let's make loads of money from girls shy enough not to go into strip club""... It made me sad - I was counting on something that would be a start of amazing acting careers for Joe Manganiello, Matt Bomer, Adam Rodriguez and Alex Pettyfer. Well, in my opinion this film won't help. Period.",/review/rw2637449/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2012,dglink,6," More Magic, Mike, More Magic
","Steven Soderbergh's ""Magic Mike"" is short on needed magic. The promised backstage tale of male strippers conjures images of sexy men, pulsating music, and erotic choreography. Unfortunately, the expected companion piece to ""Flashdance"" or ""Footloose"" is not even ""The Full Monty."" Magic Mike, competently played by Channing Tatum, is a construction worker by day, a stripper by night, and a furniture designer by ambition. A fellow hard hat on the construction site, Adam, played by Alex Pettyfer, is drawn into Mike's stripper world by the lure of easy money and even easier sex. Little unexpected happens, and the audience for naked male flesh and sexual couplings is better served at the local porn shop.",/review/rw2637449/?ref_=tt_urv

Mike is a budding entrepreneur in Tampa, Florida, who is a both a partner and performer in a male strip club, run by its over the top owner, Dallas (Matthew McConaughey).
