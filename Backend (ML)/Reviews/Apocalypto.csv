11 July 2008,diac228,9," With enough energy to generate an entire city, The Rock will absolutely blow you back into the 90s.
","The 90s was home to a slew of great raw, uncut, action flicks that shot straight for the rated ""R,"" despite the guarantee that it would make less money than the money-friendly PG-13 rating. While Die Hard and Lethal Weapon may have jump-started this craze, the peak of this was during the next decade, when we saw the likes of Terminator 2, Speed, Face-Off, Con Air, Die Hard: With a Vengeance, The Matrix, Bad Boys, Point Break, Under Siege, True Lies, Desperado, among others (Quite a list I accumulated, eh?). The 90s was certainly a good decade for action fans, but few movies of this genre can quite top the powerful, gripping, and edge-of-your seat action blockbuster The Rock. The name alone sounds powerful, and behind it is two hours of incredible special effects, superb acting, great action set pieces, and good dosage of writing, and Michael Bay on top of his game.",/review/rw4223596/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2017,Tweekums,8," Good solid action on Alcatraz
",General Francis X. Hummel has had enough of the way US service personnel have been treated; especially how the families of those who died on top secret missions are told a string of lies and not compensated for their lossÂ… to this end he decides to blackmailing the government by stealing a quantity of deadly VX gas; taking over the island of Alcatraz and threatening to launch the gas into the city of San Francisco if is demands to compensate the families aren't met within forty hours. Of course he can't do this alone; he is supported by a squad of ex-marines who expect to be paid handsomely.,/review/rw4223596/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2014,SnoopyStyle,8," Michael Bay - Nicolas Cage - Sean Connery
","Renegade general Hummel (Ed Harris) has stolen 15 VX rockets, taken over Alcatraz, taken 81 hostages, and threatens to strike San Francisco unless The Pentagon pays him $100M from their slush funds. He intends to use the money to pay the families of the soldiers under his command who the government has disavowed over the years. In order to disarm the rockets, the FBI is sending their chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage). And they're digging up a mysterious British agent prisoner John Mason (Sean Connery) who once escaped from Alcatraz. When the team sent in to take on Hummel is decimated, Goodspeed and Mason must disarm the rockets on their own.",/review/rw4223596/?ref_=tt_urv

","In an attempt to get the US Government to pay for soldiers lost on secret missions General Hummel and a group of soldiers steal biological weapons and take control of Alcatraz, threatening to launch on San Francisco if their demands are not met.  Running out of options the FBI take Mason out of prison as he has a knowledge of the island, being the only man to have escaped from there.  Mason and bio-chemical expert Goodspeed join a group of Navy SEALS to enter the island and destroy the weapons before they can be used.  However the death of the whole SEAL unit leaves Mason and Goodspeed to use stealth to avoid the terrorists and destroy the weapons.",/review/rw4223596/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2005,mstomaso,8," Adrenalized..... yikes
","The Rock is one of my all-time favorite suspense - thrillers. Believability - almost always a problem for this sort of film - is enhanced by a very compelling script, sets, and powerful performances by masters Sean Connery and Ed Harris. Like a good work of fiction, it's the quality of the telling that makes it believable, not the likelihood that it might happen. There are no problems with the way this story is told. The acting, editing, directing and visuals do not slip at all. Nick Cage - in a performance which approaches his best work - adds a bit of campiness and humor to this explosive mixture, and John Spencer, Tony Todd, David Morse, and Michael Biehn all contribute substantially to an exciting, fast-paced and emotionally draining film. Any avid movie-goer will be hard pressed to find a single actor in this sizable cast who has not either become a major star or a fine character actor over the last nine years.",/review/rw4223596/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2001,F0RCE,10," Definitely underrated!
","""The Rock"" combined action, adventure, comedy, romance, special effects and a great plot into one of the biggest worldwide blockbuster action films in decades. Add to the mix, Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage, Ed Harris and a great supporting cast including John Spencer, William Forsythe and David Morse, and ""The Rock"" is one of the best ways to spend two hours. This film also devotes a great deal of time and effort to character development, something that most action movies neglect. This film is definitely underrated and is worth more praise than it has received.",/review/rw4223596/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," A compelling villain raises this above other Michael Bay fare; it's his best work, for sure.
","Its greatest strength is a compelling, well-developed and sympathetic villain whose motivations are consistently clear and understandable while he himself never strays from being anything other than a conscientious human with complex emotions. It is unfortunate, then, that the protagonists and ensuing action sequences are goofy as can be. 'The Rock (1996)' separates its bursts of militaristic patriotism, underlined by 'cool' slow motion, with quirky Cage quips and over-the-top explosions. These aspects all fall a little flat in the end, but they're fun enough while they last. 6/10",/review/rw4223596/?ref_=tt_urv

","Having won an Oscar for ""Leaving Las Vegas"", Nicolas Cage shifted to action with ""The Rock"". Portraying renegade Gen. Francis Hummel (Ed Harris) taking over Alcatraz, necessitating a rescue mission, the movie takes an interesting look at everything. We get to learn the story behind every main character, and even the car chase turns out to have a purpose.",/review/rw4223596/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Rock has what people go to the movies for (well, the majority anyway), big action, good characters and reused plot stuffers, not to mention Sean Connery.  While I can't say I thought everything in the Rock was great, I must say it did give a good show.  Ed Harris plays a disgruntled Marine who holds Alcatraz hostage and only Biochemist Cage and Connery (the only man to escape it) can save it's hostages.  Big, loud and often Hokey, however it is gripping overall.  A-",/review/rw4223596/?ref_=tt_urv

","What an incredible ending The Rock had. You had a mutiny within a mutiny, and the action scenes at the end were incredible big time.

17 March 2007,lastliberal,8," Cage and Connery at their best
","OK, the premise is just a little wacky. Nickolas Cage, with the assistance of Sean Connery are going to bust into Alcatraz to stop some crazy general from destroying civilization. Well, that's a little exaggerated, but that's the basic idea. The General (Ed Harris) has some nasty stuff that only Cage can neutralize, but he needs Connery's assistance to get into Alcatraz to do the job. Connery is some British spy that once escaped from Alcatraz and is locked up in a secret prison because he has information on our government, including who killed Kennedy. That would have been very helpful to Oliver Stone in the making of JFK.",/review/rw4223596/?ref_=tt_urv

25 July 2000,tfrizzell,," An Action Film That Shares the Spotlight With the Actors
","""The Rock"" is an adrenaline rush of a movie that was one of the big hits of 1996.  The actual film deals with a crazed Marine (Ed Harris) who has taken over Alcatraz and holds 181 people hostage in order to get $100 million to benefit fallen comrades from U.S. wars.  If he does not receive the money, he will launch chemical warheads on San Francisco and likely kill thousands. Enter FBI scientist Nicolas Cage and former inmate Sean Connery who are sent to the island along with Michael Biehn and a special missions corps to save the day.  The film is not short on action, in fact you will find yourself trying to catch your breath during several moments.  However, the characters are all three-dimensional and interesting.  The three primary characters (Cage, Connery, and Harris) in  particular are all well-developed.  All in all this is a good film to fill time in one's day, but it is not for those with a weak heart.  4 out of 5 stars.",/review/rw4223596/?ref_=tt_urv

","Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage) is a chemical weapons specialist for the FBI. So when a rogue general (Ed Harris) overtakes Alcatraz island and has a variety of rockets with VX warheads, he is called in to stop the general. But first he must subdue his new partner, lifelong convict and criminal genius Mason (Sean Connery). (I'm tempted to ask why the government has illegal VX warheads... something the movie never discusses... but I won't bother.) ",/review/rw4223596/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2012,zardoz-13,10," Incredibly Entertaining Nonsense
","Ostensibly, ""The Rock"" ranks as Sean Connery's last memorable motion picture. This supercharged, high-octane, but improbable shoot'em up concerns renegade Army General who takes civilian hostages, occupies Alcatraz Prison with a small force, and threatens to fire poison rockets with deadly VX gas at San Francisco if the government refuses to bow to his demands. The FBI assigns Special Agent Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage of ""Con-Air"") to the case, and he receives help from the only man who successfully escaped from Alcatraz. As it turns out, this brilliant individual is former British secret service agent John Mason (Sean Connery of ""Zardoz"") who has been buried in the U .S. Penal system because he got his hands of all of America's top-secrets. FBI Director Womack (John Spencer) fears Mason. He sends in Goodspeed to negotiate with Mason. Naturally, Mason demands a trip into San Francisco, a meal in a sumptuous hotel, and a haircut. Eventually, a reluctant Mason leads Cage under the island, and they set out to disarm the rockets. Our heroes face a deadline as they battle their way through bowels of the prison. The Navy plans to obliterate the island if Mason and Goodspeed blow it. The first obstacle that our heroes encounter is a massacre in the prison showers when Hummel's men wipe out a squad of Navy Seals. One of the best scenes concerns a chase through the streets of San Francisco with Connery driving a Hummer. The script bristles with great lines. The music is terrific. If you watch closely, Cage's character learns how to lie during the course of the action. Michael Bay never lets the pace lag. Composers Nick Glennie-Smith and Hans Zimmer enhance the spine-tingling suspense with atmospheric music.",/review/rw4223596/?ref_=tt_urv

","Okay, so it may not be the greatest film ever produced, but it sure is up there with the most fun. Sometimes a film is just perfect. Or, to be precise, it's absolutely perfect for what it is.

","THE ROCK (1996) ***1/2 Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage, Ed Harris, William Forsythe, Michael Biehn, John Spencer, David Morse, Vanessa Marcil, Tony Todd, John C. McGinley, Bokeem Woodbine, Anthony Clark. Action packed high octane machine of a movie with disgruntled ex-Marine hero Harris taking a group of tourists hostage at Alcatraz with a band of mercenaries and a group of poison gas equipped rockets aimed at San Francisco with only two men capable of thwarting him: prisoner Connery, a former British spy incarcerated since his escape from the infamous jail and goofy 'super freak' FBI chemist Cage (the best thing about the film by the way) teamed up to infiltrate and dismantle the weaponry PHEW! Breakneck paced editing and some wicked sequences added with the right amount of cocky humor. Cage's reluctant every-man FEEB is memorable, particularly witnessing a nasty dispatch of one of the villains: 'Well, yeak OK , that's just about the most awful thing I've ever seen.' Smartly directed by maverick Michael Bay and the last film produced by the dynamic duo of Don Simpson (who died during production) and Jerry Bruckheimer.",/review/rw4223596/?ref_=tt_urv

2 August 2016,KineticSeoul,10," Kick-ass and entertaining movie from Michael Bay. Even Hideo Kojima tried to emulate this into his ""Metal Gear Solid"" games.
","Now I am not a big fan of the director Michael Bay, but this movie is kick-ass and is his best film. Sure, it still has the Michael Bay trademarks with chases and explosions, but it's integrated quite well into this movie. And actually has a cool plot, and stylistic emotions to go with it. It isn't the most intelligent plot but it does get the job done. Sure some parts might be a bit exaggerated, but for a action movie such as this, it works. It isn't a action movie that should be taken too seriously, it's suppose to be a kick- ass action flick. And like I said just about everything about this movie works. Especially when it comes to the entertainment department. From the action, to the passable dialogues and music it just melds together into a fun action ride. What really stood out about this movie while re-watching it, was how it was so obvious Hideo Kojima took notes and borrowed elements from this film. Especially when it comes to the style, action and characters. And how Hideo Kojima incorporated some of the ideas and tries to emulate it into the ""Metal Gear Solid"" franchise. I remember when this film came out and how it was one of the biggest action movie of the 90's. As a matter of fact this film and ""Face/Off"" is my favorite action movies from the 90's. When I saw this movie in the 90's I was just blown away by how cool it was. It is probably the movie that I could remember where I saw Sean Connery in action for the first time. And at that time, I thought he was the most badass old guy I have ever seen on screen. Even Nicolas Cage's freak-outs actually complimented this movie. Overall, this movie is a blast and I highly recommend it to just about anyone. Especially people that are fans of the ""Metal Gear Solid"" franchise or people that are into action movies in general. Sure it has it's flaws when it comes to the narrative because of few plot-holes. But it's not all that distracting and sometimes it actually compliments this film somehow.",/review/rw4223596/?ref_=tt_urv
