24 September 2013,Loving_Silence,10," An Honest and Emotionally Devastating Film about Life, Love and Sexuality
","I just want to start off by saying this is an amazing film about young love that is actually honest with its audience. There are countless of films about people falling in love, but when you see ""Blue is the Warmest Colour"". You realize just how rare films are that make a sincere attempt to catch what it really is like to fall for someone, without sentimentality, forced cuteness or cheap emotional manipulation. This is the rare love story that has real emotional truth about it. The fact that it is about two women who fall for each other is almost secondary to the way the film catches the universality of what it is like to fall in love and maintain the relationship. ""Blue is the Warmest Colour is a naturalistic and touching film, whether you're gay, straight, bisexual, or whatever orientation. This is a film that can give you relationship advice and life guidance no matter what your orientation may be. It isn't an indulgent film bringing only a unique gay relationship to light and nothing more, and it isn't an ode to ""coming out"" and stockpiled clichés of ""being different."" It shows how an interaction with a person can have a truly provocative impact on you as a person.",/review/rw3000920/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2013,zetes,9," The life of Adele
","This year's Palm d'Or winner is a coming of age story about a teenage girl, Adele (the literal title in French is The Life of Adele), who discovers her homosexuality and begins a relationship with Emma, a college student. For a while, I was thinking this was a good but fairly unremarkable entry into the queer cinema canon, but, over the film's three hours, well, you see why the long running time was necessary. It is just a very detailed picture of a life. It feels more real than most films - it feels like more time has past and that we've just felt Adele's growth. Frankly, I didn't feel the length of it at all - I wanted it to be longer. It really helps that the actresses are so perfect. Adele Exarchopoulos is simply fantastic - this is the performance of the year, really. Her face is so expressive. The film takes place over several years, and you really do see her grow from a child to an adult. Lea Seydoux plays Emma. Her role is less demanding, but she's still great in it. Now, the biggest story of this film has probably been the graphic sex scenes. My opinion on them: I actually do think they're a bit too graphic, gratuitous and almost pornographic. I try to justify them artistically in my mind, and I'm afraid I can't. There's a plot point near the end where you kind of have to know that the girls' sex life was fantastic, but I'm not sure we had to see it in anywhere near as much detail as we did. They're without a doubt awkward to sit through, but they don't ruin the film either.",/review/rw3000920/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2013,howard.schumann,9," Unique in its openness and honesty
","Though Blue is the Warmest Color, winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, contains graphic depictions of sex, it is not a voyeuristic exercise but a complex, deeply intense film that elevates one young woman's personal struggle into a drama of universal relevance. Adapted by Kechiche and Ghalia Lacroix from the novel by Julie Maroh, Tunisian born French director Abdellatif Kechiche's fifth feature looks with piercing eyes into the coming-of-age years of Adèle (Adèle Exarchopoulos), and her relationship with the more mature Emma (Lea Seydoux), a relationship that does not fit anyone's pictures.

","While watching 'La Vie d'Adèle', I regularly thought about 'Entre les Murs', the winner of the Palme d'Or in Cannes five years ago. Not only because in both films many scenes take place in classrooms, but also because they both have an ultra-authentic feeling. ",/review/rw3000920/?ref_=tt_urv

1 February 2014,Andy-296,2," Explicit and disappointing
","This widely acclaimed, almost three hour movie about adolescent lesbian love in a high school in France is nothing special in my opinion. Tunisian born director Abdelatif Kechiche has shown some sensibility in previous movies (for instance Games of Love and Chance) but this Cannes festival winner feels quite exploitative (his previous movie, Black Venus, was also nasty, disappointing and sensationalistic). The young actresses who play the lead (Lea Seydoux and Adele Exarchopoulos), who are not porn actresses, appear in very explicit, apparently non simulated sex scenes (including masturbation, oral sex, fingering and doing the sex position popularly known as the 69). It would be interesting to wonder if a lesbian director (instead of a male director) would have filmed this story differently, perhaps less explicitly and more subtly. Interestingly, both actresses have complained after the film was released that they felt exploited during the filming and will not work with the director again. Based on a graphic novel.",/review/rw3000920/?ref_=tt_urv

Adèle dates his schoolmate Thomas (Jérémie Laheurte) and they have sex, but Adèle does not feel pleasure. She goes with her homosexual schoolmate Valentin (Sandor Funtek) to a gay bar, where she meets the lesbian Arts student and painter Emma (Léa Seydoux) and soon they have a love affair. But love is eternal while it lasts. ",/review/rw3000920/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2013,The_Film_Cricket,," It's more than just naked bodies.
","Forget, for a moment, that ""Blue is the Warmest Colour"" is the story about two women in love. Here is a movie so universal in its themes and so broad in its emotions that it could really be about people of any gender, race or sexual orientation. While Hollywood films simply prattle on about love while merely copying sitcom nonsense, here is a French film that will mean something to anyone who has ever had the pleasure and the pain of being in love.",/review/rw3000920/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2013,kriddirk,9," An extraordinary Love story, applicable to all of us !!
","I waited some days to review this title after seeing this film. This movie triggered me thinking about love and life and I waited to give it my neutral review. I am watching movies since the latest 30 years and I have to say ; This movie is special !! After 30 years of seeing all kind of movies I have narrowed my scope of movies to see. They have to be special, show me something different, give me ideas to think about or to evaluate in my own life. So, movies like World war Z is not directly my style. This movie although is one of the best love stories I have seen. No unnecessary emotional or cuteness parts, each part of the story is real and genius. It is the soft moments of a love story, the hard moments bringing to the screen. The movie is made in away you are in the skin of Adele and Emma ( can't remember the actress names ). They take you with them in their love story, their feelings. That is also the reason that the 3 hours of the movie is not too long at all. I was surprised it took 3 hours when the film ended. The movie handles the passion between them, a passion that many of us forget over the years in a relation. That passion is also expressed in about 3 sex scenes, 3 scenes which are quiet honest and direct. Some people will find these scenes too long ( one of them could take 10 minutes ), but I find it necessary to establish your follow up of the passion they have between each other, so that when things goes worse you also are one with the situation.",/review/rw3000920/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm sure that there's a good movie somewhere in la Vie d'Adèle. Unfortunately, it's obscured by so many redundant scenes that any goodness is totally obscured. The viewer is treated again and again to scenes of an open-mouthed Adèle Exarchopoulos doing the roomba with school children to the accompaniment of Afro-Arab music. OK, we get it. Ideally France welcomes immigrants from Africa and the Middle East and really isn't the xenophobic place we see and hear about on the news.",/review/rw3000920/?ref_=tt_urv

","I saw this film on the last night it was playing at my local theater and I jumped on the opportunity. Once it was over I realized how smart of a decision it was. I read a review of the film that said something along the lines of, ""the trouble with this film being 3 hours is that you want to watch it for several more."" I couldn't agree more with that statement. The story, along with its characters, moves the film along to the point where it didn't feel like 3 hours. ",/review/rw3000920/?ref_=tt_urv

","Adele is an ungainly teenager with a perpetually dopey look and a constantly runny nose. She's a dreamer and a reader and doesn't feel like she fits in at school or home. Her parents are solidly working class -- they seem nice enough and caring enough, but they also seem like they wouldn't understand a daughter who wanted to be, say, an artist or a philosopher. And they certainly wouldn't be comfortable with Adele's emerging lesbianism.",/review/rw3000920/?ref_=tt_urv

After passing a blue-haired girl on the street who catches her eye and an even more confusing, spontaneous and upsetting encounter with a classmate she finds it all to curious and enticing when a close, male friend takes her to a gay bar, she follows some girls to another bar nearby where she sees the blue- haired girl again.

","I have to say, I found this to be a huge disappointment. I thought the first act was great but after that I just lost more and more interest in it. I want to do this in a few bullet points. What was up with Adele's sexuality? I thought the first act made it obvious that she's actually a lesbian and, although she's tried to make it work with males, she's just not able to (as evidenced by the events with the super hot guy in the beginning... If you don't want him, I'll take him Adele!). I thought this was very firmly established, so then why is she supposedly hooking up with a guy later on because she feels ""lonely""? I thought being with men didn't fulfill anything in her? But she's with a man later on because she feels lonely? I wouldn't have a problem with this had the first act not contradicted this. Am I missing something? Maybe someone can clarify it...",/review/rw3000920/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2013,pmuchteros,10," A movie you can't forget
","Cinematic orgasm. Cinematic. Orgasm. Put the words together and separately, it does not matter actually. I was watching the film with a sense of bitten apricot in my mouth, so from time to time I kept checking if indeed something was dripping from my lips . In any case, you can feel all kinds of dripping in this garden of delight and from many different angles. A deep diving into puberty, into the raw desires of youth, above the thunderous victory of human need. Adele is the personification of youth, just in time when it begins to grown. That exact moment when the juices of love are instantly aggressive and the human body seems like a fruit with the heart as a kernel. When you are in the midst of immortality, gaining the illusion of eternity, just before the fruit is eaten, shortly before the kernel sits at your neck with the bitter taste of rejection, while you greedily swallow life, which seems so inexhaustible. I left my local cinema with the feeling of a hot lump in my throat and stomach. As a teenager in love and disappointed at the same time. And from that moment I keep seeing little hearts and stars everywhere. I keep seeing Adele everywhere.",/review/rw3000920/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have never seen a film about a face until Blue. Almost every emotion the face can show is expressed by the leading actress: longing, satisfaction, shame, allure, hunger, anger, grief, boredom, suspicion. I was worried after the opening scenes that the film was one of stark realism despite its whimsical title. However, after a short time, it took on its poetical style, and in the street, just before Adele sees Emma, we hear the first sound of music. From then on the film is an exercise in cinematic eloquence. ",/review/rw3000920/?ref_=tt_urv
