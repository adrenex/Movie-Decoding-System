18 December 2018,ilikeimdb,5," Stunning cinematography mixed with pathos and a boring story line
","For the most part, watching Roma was about as interesting as watching paint dry...but not just *any* paint, but the most perfect, precious, beautifully applied paint imaginable. And not just paint in any room, but a room designed to be the best room with the best lighting and the best layout...and, oh, this was paint drying under high humidity conditions so you needed to watch the paint dry in a single, long-flowing take to appreciate the reflective nuances of the paint in all its evolving glory and often from unusually low angles of perspective since that yields special visual treats. Best Director. Best Cinematography. Best Paint Job. Ultimately not engaging.",/review/rw4573106/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2018,gortx,," Cuaron's lovely ode to his childhood in Mexico City
",The title refers to the neighborhood in Mexico City where Director Alfonso Cuaron grew up in the 70s. It could just have easily been entitled 'Libo' for the movie is the filmmaker's reflection on the woman who helped raise him - his family's maid. The fictionalized story renames the woman Cleo (a lovely natural performance by newcomer Yalitza Aparicio).,/review/rw4573106/?ref_=tt_urv

22 February 2019,claudio_carvalho,6," The Daily Life of a Maid in the 70´s in Mexico
","The boring daily life of a maid in the 70´s in Mexico is the storyline of ""Roma"". The screenplay follows the life of Cleo, the maid of an upper middle-class family. This is a typical film for professional critics and viewers from the First World. For a Third World viewer, the situations shown in ""Roma"" happen everywhere and every time and are part of the dailylife. The beautiful black-and-white cinematography and the excellent camerawork are the great parts of this average and overrated film. My vote is six.",/review/rw4573106/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2019,TheLittleSongbird,10," Stunning slice of life
","Have a lot of admiration for Alfonso Cuaron as a director. Also really like to love almost all of his films (having been mixed on 'Great Expectations'), though 'Gravity' is one of those more appreciate than love divisive films that also boasted some of the best cinematography and direction of that year. Of his previous films am especially fond of 'Children of Men' and 'A Little Princess' (the film that introduced me to his work and is a personal favourite) in their own way for different reasons.",/review/rw4573106/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2019,dierregi,1," Pretentious, plotless and soporific
","I really had to force myself to watch this movie on Netflix, in three times, each ""session"" lasting as long as I could, before I started to drift off. I knew I was in trouble from the opnening scene of a symmetrically tiled floor being washed. Interesting it wasn't, but for sure it lasted a very long time. The unexciting opening credits were followed by disconnected episodes in the life of a large family and their two maids. Apologies to the politically correct police, but for a while I could not distinguish one maid from the other. After a while I learnt one was Cleo and the other Adela.",/review/rw4573106/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2018,andrewroy-04316,7," An indisputable technically impeccable work, but this very realistic depiction of everyday life feels just that: mundane
","I feel very similarly to Roma as I did to Dunkirk, though they are extraordinarily different films and subject matters. Both are made by directors I love, and both I appreciate the constant technical brilliance shown in each scene. Ultimately in both cases I was emotionally detached and thought it was a good movie but not at all a memorable one. There is no doubt that Roma leans entirely on Aparicio, and she knocks it out of the park. The subtlety to her acting and her body language and uses of silence are excellent. As is Cuaron's hallmark, the cinematography is excellent, and particularly the 360 pan with Cleo turning off the lights was well shot. The childbirth and ocean scenes were enrapturing and tense. The scene in the furniture store was my favorite of the movie - the intersection of the small private world we've seen with the family and the student protests outside was well shot and executed.
I can intellectually appreciate all the things Roma has to offer, and can understand why some think it's a masterpiece and the best of the year. If it emotionally connected with people and had them crying at the end, I just didn't have that experience. It's a very well done slice of life movie that focuses on appreciation for a maid who does everything for a family, and in going through her daily life we see other major events unfold. But despite consistently great acting and cinematography and several really good scenes, the vast majority of the movie varied from smart but detached filmmaking to mundane, every day life. Maybe the black and white and Spanish elements also contributed, but I just didn't particularly enjoy most of the individual scenes. Reflecting on it as a full piece and the motifs that we see throughout allow me to enjoy and appreciate it more, but while watching it I just wasn't invested. I'm glad most love it and think this is just me not connecting with the film, but while Roma is a technical marvel, it was just a fine story.",/review/rw4573106/?ref_=tt_urv

30 January 2019,Turfseer,5," Beautiful cinematography subsumed by portrait of an overly saintly protagonist
","Based on the childhood recollections of Director Alfonso Cuarón, Roma is set in the Colonia Roma neighborhood of Mexico City in the early 70s. I was much impressed with Cuarón's 2013 mainstream sci-fi picture, Gravity, a visual tour-de-force. Here he's decided to try his hand at art house fare and once again has hit a home run in the visual department. Filmed in black and white, Roma is a film filled with striking images as well as a stunning soundtrack which features no music-instead there is only ambient sound which captures the atmosphere of Cuarón's middle class household as well as other neighborhoods in Mexico City which prove fraught with political tension and violence.",/review/rw4573106/?ref_=tt_urv

","This was just garbage! After about 30 minutes of watching the lead actress do mundane tasks like washing dishes, making up beds, turning out lights, and listening to dialog that was just meaningless, one knew that the whole Oscar nomination was just pure hype.

24 February 2019,Luigi Di Pilla,1," First of all why in black and white?
","Was this a joke? After nearly two hours of my life i stopped it. Nothing and really nothing happened in this movie.
The only thing that I agree is one point concerning the human dramtical side. But to show the story in two hours and 15 minutes in black and white it could have been cut for at least two hours.
This movie is a good way to fall asleep and not for one reason more. How is it possible that it has been nominated for best direction? Stay away you won't regret it. too overrated. Read carefully all the critics here and you will understand.
1 star just for the pregnant wife who played her role perfectly.",/review/rw4573106/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2018,themadmovieman,8," Deeply immersive, incredibly intimate, and visually exceptional
","Many films use a sense of nostalgia in portrayals of times gone by, but few do it in quite as powerful fashion as Alfonso Cuarón's Roma. A deeply immersive film at every moment, perfectly capturing the time period and pulling you in right from the start, Roma is a slow and patient drama that you just can't take your eyes off, something that's furthered by exceptional cinematography, wonderful performances, and a slow-burn but deeply emotional story throughout.",/review/rw4573106/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2019,alansabljakovic-39044,9," Hands down to this masterpiece
","Roma is the best movie of 2018 and the best movie Alfonso Cuaron ever made. Story is heartbreaking and very inspirational. I don't know where he found the lead actress but that performance was phenomenal. Uhh don't let me start about cinematography. Cinematography is so amazing and it is one of the best this decade. Cuarons details and long shots makes this visual masterpiece. The black and white are used so well in this film in a way you couldn't even imagine.
Oscars Roma should get:
1. Best Picture
2. Best Foreign Film
3. Best Director
4. Best Cinematography
5. Best Original Screenplay
6. Best actress (but it will be close with Close :P)

28 October 2018,nairtejas,8," MAMI Review: Roma (8 Stars)
","At around the 100th minute, Roma made me gasp. And then it stole a tiny tear from me. The story of a singleton, who works as a full-time caretaker and maid for an upper middle-class family in Mexico City in the year 1971 is what all the dictionaries around the world should change their definition of the word 'poignant' to. There is no other way to describe what director Alfonso Cuaron has carved in monochrome in Roma which is a film about everything, with an unpredictable and neat narration, somber music, and above all, a never-ending string of beautiful elements to look at. I have this theory that even if you don't watch Roma to understand what it tries to convey and just look at the flowy cinematography and the visually loud frames in motion in front of you, you will feel a peculiar energy transferring into your body. An energy to face the world like the protagonist Cleo faces (or tries to face) in this tragic drama that is built with so much attention to details that I would need an essay to describe the subtexts and small symbolic references that the film makes to send across a message about human nature and relationships, social hierarchy, politics, and violence. Roma made me gasp, laugh, and consider - and it does so in such a random order that you will find it difficult to realize that it's just a film. The running time might remind you that, but let's not talk about it because it is probably the only thing that will prevent you from feeling the film. TN.",/review/rw4573106/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2019,lee_eisenberg,10," being a maid in an uncertain world
","Alfonso Cuarón's ""Roma"" is about a maid working for a middle class family in Mexico City in 1970-71, but overall focuses on a couple of things. The obvious point is Mexico's social hierarchy. The protagonist is Mixtec, while her employers are white. One scene pans across the rooftops, showing the maids hanging people's clothes. Equally important is the political situation in Mexico at the time. Industrialization in the 1950s and 1960s had driven millions of rural people into the capital, where they had to live in slums. The years of Cuarón's childhood were marked by the army's massacre of protesters in Tlatelolco right before the Olympics started, and then by the Corpus Christi Massacre (which the movie depicts). The depiction of the father abandoning the family brings to mind Cuarón's expose of Mexico's ruling class in ""Y Tu Mamá También"" (which also showed the country's hierarchy).",/review/rw4573106/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2019,shakercoola,8," An enthralling personal story
","A Mexican-American drama; This film set in the middle-class neighborhood of Roma in Mexico City is an artful tale about a domestic servant, an emotional portrait of domestic strife and social hierarchy amidst political turmoil in 1971. The notions of family and friendship are delicately observed and the performances are strong, especially the part played by the lead, Yalitza Aparicio. Narratively, it is very straightforward and yet it is thought provoking and it has cinematic spectacle.",/review/rw4573106/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2019,monberger,10," Amor is Roma!!!
","Roma is essentially beautiful unique of a film. Cuarón has demonstrated creatively innovated way to tell a story. The direction, cinematography, production design, sound and sound mixing are in compass to make a beautiful harmonious work of art. There's not an original score for this film which it makes it stand alone, instead Cuarón has used pieces of radio hit songs from that era, as part of the environmental scene. It's well crafted screenplay perfectly works with the acting of every cast in Roma, especially with the two leads in the film. Aparicio and Tavira are magnificent portraying a passage in the life of 1970's middle class Mexican family. It's simple, and real.
It's 10 nominations for the Oscars are truly deserved it, and my hopes are that is given at least the two top awards for this masterpiece, best directing and best picture of the year.
Note: if you are a superficial cinema watcher, this is not for you.",/review/rw4573106/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2018,Cineanalyst,8," Children of Women
","This one creeps up on you, but it's worth the effort to stay with it for the climactic emotional wallops. Granted, for much of its languorous two-and-a-quarter hours, ""Roma"" appears to be another in a long line of staid domestic dramas--the sort of foreign-language pictures that seem to frequently garner some critical praise around awards season, and this one appears all the more artsy with its desaturated black-and-white look. There's the focus on the lower end of class stratification, with the protagonist Cleo, an indigenous Mexican, as a live-in maid to an educated middle-class family of presumably some European ancestry. While the family of her employers struggles from the abandonment of their father, so does Cleo face her own problems being disavowed by the man who impregnated her. Meanwhile, the narrative occasionally cues us into the political turmoil of its setting in early-1970s Mexico, with the poverty, land seizures and redistribution, and the massacre of student protesters. While much of this is of some interest, especially for offering a semi-autobiographical account of the childhood of one of today's premiere filmmakers, Alfonso Cuarón (""Children of Men"" (2006) and ""Gravity"" (2013), among others), the heart of ""Roma"" is the dramatic arc of Cleo.",/review/rw4573106/?ref_=tt_urv
