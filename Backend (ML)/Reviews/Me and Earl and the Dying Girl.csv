2 January 2015,shawneofthedead,6," Neither a disaster nor a classic, but decent, fun and action-packed in its own right.
","It isn't easy to make a good fantasy film – as borne out by Seventh Son, which has suffered a particularly arduous journey to the silver screen. Originally slated for release in February 2013, its visual effects house went bankrupt and its studio, Legendary Pictures, parted ways with distributor Warner Bros. The film that's finally stumbling into cinemas almost two full years later (courtesy of Universal Pictures) should be an unmitigated disaster. Surprisingly, it's not. The film isn't exactly great, but it's a largely entertaining romp that's more inspired by than strictly faithful to Joseph Delaney's series of bestselling books.",/review/rw3750559/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2015,Gordon-11,," Fun but forgettable
","This film tells the tale of a seventh son from a village, who is chosen by a master to fight the evil witch who will rule the land.",/review/rw3750559/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2015,witster18,6," Pleasantly surprised. Mindless entertainment
","I've rented many a film over the last year, knowing exactly what I was getting into, going-in with meager expectations, and all too often, even those haven't been met. Stathom's ""Wild Card"", ""In Cold Blood""... You know, films that you know aren't going to be great, but you just hope they keep your attention and fill whatever genre craving I happen to have that particular evening.

8 January 2015,3xHCCH,6," Typical Fantasy Action Film
","Set in medieval times in Europe somewhere, ""Seventh Son"" brings us back to a time when supernatural beings like witches, ghosts, ghasts and the like wreak terror on the countryside. The people depend on a special knight called the ""Spook"" to fight these creatures and restore peace. ",/review/rw3750559/?ref_=tt_urv

","The hunter of supernatural creatures Master Gregory (Jeff Bridges) traps the queen of the witches Mother Malkin (Julianne Moore) is a pit on the top of a mountain. Years later, she escapes from the pit and Master Gregory and his apprentice Mr. Bradley (Kit Harington) hunt her down. However Mother Malkin kills Mr. Bradley and flees to a derelict castle that she restores with magic. She meets her sister Bony Lizzie (Antje Traue) and her niece Alice (Alicia Vikander) and plans to destroy Master Gregory to begin her kingdom of evil. Meanwhile the old hunter recruits the naive farmer Tom Ward (Ben Barnes), who is the seventh son of the seventh son of the Ward family, to team up with him and his partner Tusk (John DeSantis) to hunt down Mother Malkin. Tom's mother (Olivia Williams), who is secretly a good witch, gives a necklace with a magic stone to protect him. They head to the village where Tom meets Alice and falls in love with her. But what is the true intention of Alice? Will they succeed in destroying the powerful Mother Malkin?",/review/rw3750559/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2015,Robert_duder,8," An unfortunate failure that was actually very very entertaining
","After seeing a trailer or two I was actually quite excited about seeing Seventh Son. Its been awhile since I've seen a good fantasy medieval film and I was looking forward to it. I am very pleased to say that this was nearly a perfect and fun popcorn flick and well worth my time. I'm actually very disappointed that it isn't doing better because I think they could certainly have turned this into a franchise and I couldn't help but think that the film leads into what could be a really terrific TV Series as well. The film however tanked and that won't be happening but please don't let that deter you from checking this out especially if you enjoy the genre. The story is terrific, the cinematography is great and the story is decent. It has a good cast and terrific action scenes. It has an old school fantasy vibe to it but everything works quite well. It isn't brilliant and it would never take home any awards but I was completely entertained and I would watch it again and that marks a good film in my book. The pacing is good and it has plenty of action to keep you hooked. The romantic storyline is also surprisingly good as well.",/review/rw3750559/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2015,Vaduen,6," For Fantasy Fans Who Enjoy The Genre, It's An OK Watch.
","I can see why critics and people in general are dissing the film. I think the problem with the film, is that it's director, Sergey Bodrov has never done a film of this scope. At least, never a film with a budget of 95 million dollars. ",/review/rw3750559/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2015,helmutty,7," A mildly entertaining 3D adventure for the start of the year
","The long-delayed young adult book adaptation finally shows up on big screen. Asia noticeably has an earlier release date. The question now is ""Is it worth the wait?"" For a movie delayed this long, people have already forgotten about it so I won't be surprised if it flops at box office. This gets as generic as what a fantasy period film can be. It is packed with every cliché you find in the genre however it is still entertaining with its action set pieces, decent CGI and 3D.",/review/rw3750559/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2014,moviexclusive,," Not even A-listers like Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore can save this under-developed and under-directed fantasy epic wannabe from its own tedium and mediocrity
","Hollywood has of late had a lousy track record of fantasy action epics, and 'Seventh Son', which arrives just in time to close off the year, is yet another blemish to add to that list. Delayed nearly a year while its production company Legendary switched studios, this Universal release assembles A-listers Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore with 'The Chronicles of Narnia' star Ben Barnes for an expensive big- screen adaptation of the first book of Joseph Delaney's 'The Wardstone Chronicles' against tawdry sets and second-rate visual effects.",/review/rw3750559/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2015,rprince-832-6294,4," Cliché as a film can be
","-Seventh Son (2015) movie review: -Seventh Son is a fantasy/adventure film about the last man in an order of knights that were basically medieval Ghostbusters. He takes on a new, young apprentice who is destined for greatness and blah blah blah prophecy, blah blah blah training, blah blah blah evil threat, blah blah blah fulfil his destiny type of thing.",/review/rw3750559/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2015,siderite,5," Mindbogglingly bad!
","I have read a few books from the Spook's Apprentice series and I can tell you with certainty that this movie is very far from the plot there. Worst than that, every decent scene in the film is in the trailer and the rest are just filling. No real fights, no real drama, the acting was abysmal, but it pales in comparison with the script, which seems to be have been written by a banker worrying he is giving the world too much. It is a horribly bad film that I advise against watching.",/review/rw3750559/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2015,korcsmarosandras,7," Solid fantasy-adventure
","I'm afraid after many delays and with a February release date in the US, this would flop. I would understand it in a way. It looks like a cheap B-movie. And a B-movie it is: offers nothing new, nothing special, it exists only to entertain. And you know what? I LOVE that. I'm THAT kind of person.",/review/rw3750559/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2015,The-Sarkologist,7," Another fantasy adventure to satisfy your appetite
","I'm going to give this a reasonably high rating because I actually quite enjoyed it, though I have since discovered that it has been absolutely plastered by the critics. Okay, I agree that it is the same tired old fantasy story with some great special effects, and it did feel a little lame, especially as we get to the end of the film, but that didn't mean I didn't like it. I have certainly seen worse, and it is a good dose of fantasy that is short enough not to drag and long enough to keep me satisfied.",/review/rw3750559/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2015,hypersonic8999,8," Underrated
","This is a pretty good movie and I wasn't expecting it at all, based on the scores it received. It's story stays true to the atmosphere the film creates. It brings back the feel of 80's fantasy movies. It's cheesy, epic and fun. It manages to stay away from the current clichés that teenage vampire movies have created. Instead it delivers fantasy for all ages.",/review/rw3750559/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2015,Garcwrites,7," Great potential but
",When I first saw the trailer for the movie it shone a light on a book series that I didn't know about. The first trailer was interesting and entertaining. The second one was about just as good as the first one but the movie kinda disappointed me. ,/review/rw3750559/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2016,kosmasp,6," Being last
","I think another reviewer put it nicely when he wrote, that this is neither a disaster nor a classic. It can be entertaining though, if you let yourself into the fantasy world. You've got really good actors in this and they're having fun. Jeff Bridges seems to channel a bit of Tom Hardy, though it's hard to tell sometimes the way he talks (in this case it's slightly different and almost to earnest for the tone of the movie itself, which is way lighter).",/review/rw3750559/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2020,m_winship,7," Jeff Bridges also!
","""With a little help, most of life's curses can be a gift!"" This show starts out with one hell of a Dragon Lady to defeat. Tom Ward is a sort of lynchpin between good and evil. A wonderful, all star cast, pulls this series together with a bond between a wizard and his new apprentice , (as all previous ones wound up dead!). The Dragon Lady witch is literally a real Dragon too. Since I've just started out, I wish not to reveal much and avoid spoilers. Enjoy, and tell me your thoughts too.

30 May 2015,210west,8," Despite the lousy reviews, pretty damned charming
","I've just watched this, on the same day I saw the new ""Mad Max"" (in 3-D, no less), and I have to say that, despite the almost universally dismissive reviews you'll find online, I found ""Seventh Son"" ten times more enjoyable than the empty and overheated ""Max."" And also -- thanks to its engaging characters -- considerably more suspenseful.",/review/rw3750559/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2018,nogodnomasters,4," LEGEND AND NIGHTMARE ARE ALIVE
","This is a simple story of good vs. evil. Master Gregory (Jeff Bridges) is a knight/spook and the last of his kind who fights ""creatures of the dark."" He is up against a bunch of them lead by Mother Malkin (Julianna Moore) and not Maleficent as that would lead to a lawsuit. Gregory has been going through apprentices like water and has been following in the latest Hollywood B movie craze by having our hero being someone who drinks too much. His next apprentice to help him fight evil is the seventh son of a seventh son, Tom Ward (Ben Barnes) a scrawny pig farmer who likes to throw knives. He has his own secret. There is also Alice (Alicia Vikander) the niece of Mother Malkin who adds a Romeo and Juliet element to the tale.",/review/rw3750559/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2022,tabuno,8," Good but it could have been a tad better
","Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore and an up and coming actress Alicia Vikander along with Ben Barnes headline this action fantasy about evil witches, dragons, and other magical creatures. This movie could have been better with its dénouement (conclusion) as well as some of the action scenes and better development and use of the ""vision"" ability of Tom Ward. Nevertheless, the overall script was tight, the climax almost succeeds, and the ending better than most fantasy movies with its less than predictable ending as most movies go. The movie had variety, the typical build up, nice set designs and make-up, and a consistent storyline development. This was an enjoyable movie that did not quite succeed in setting a new bar for fantasy movies. Definitely worth a look for the future possibilities. Good attempt, better than most.",/review/rw3750559/?ref_=tt_urv
