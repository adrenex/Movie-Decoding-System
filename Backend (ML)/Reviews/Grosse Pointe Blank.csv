19 August 2008,mstomaso,8," France's Tragic Teenage Warrior Messiah
","I found Luc Besson's take on the story of Joan of Arc thoroughly compelling. Like all of Besson's films, The Messenger is highly stylized, nicely cast, and visually powerful. The film is also forgivably anachronistic in terms of language while developing a strong period feel through sets and costume. ",/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2000,Buddy-51,," imperfect but interesting film
","If it were not based on a true story, Luc Besson's `The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc' would be a tale filled with credibility gaps a mile wide. Since it is, however, a recounting of one of the world's most famous stories of military triumph and personal tragedy, the film actually generates the most interest when it concentrates on just those mind-boggling historical incredibilities.",/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2016,roystephen-81252,10," A mesmerising character study
","I love epic historical movies, both old and new (although I must admit I lean towards the latter - the more realistic, more visceral ones, like Braveheart or Gladiator). The story of Joan of Arc has been put on the silver screen countless times, and most versions are good. With such a captivating story, you cannot really go wrong.",/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2013,dave13-1,8," A lot of reviewers loathed this film
","...but it still made interesting viewing. More biographies of Jeanne d'Arc exist than of any other person, and any attempt to portray her rather incredible life as France's greatest heroine and martyr on film can expect to encounter a similarly large number of second-guessers. This is precisely what happened when this picture came out. Reviewers went on at length about what the picture should have been about, and how Joan should have been portrayed (and by whom), leaving readers to wonder what they thought of the picture that HAD been made. This tendency to review the picture they wish had been made is a classic failing in many critics and this picture seemed to bring it out especially often.",/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2004,Mercian,," Inspired by...?
","There are many deviations from the accepted facts of Jeanne d'Arc's life as set out in her trial documentation and the writings of the time. This said, the central question of whether she was a saint, an inspired lunatic, wholly mentally ill, or simply a headstrong girl determined to grab her chances while she could is well asked. Many of the comments here assert that Besson makes it clear that the Maid was simply mentally ill, yet I read the film as deeply ambivalent about what was going on. Were her visions the hallucinations of a schizophrenic? Were they given by God? What's the difference? More questions are asked: Why does an omnipotent, omniscient, all-compassionate deity allow terrible things to happen? What is the meaning of kingship - to own or to serve? What is the difference between taking the lives of individuals and killing en masse? What's the difference between Christianity and the earthly institutions of that religion? Where does conviction end and fanaticism begin? ",/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2007,rooprect,7," So good it made me want to give Ultraviolet another try
","My first Milla Jovovich movie was Ultraviolet, which has spawned more ""worst movie ever"" threads on IMDb than any other. Well, I wouldn't call it that bad, but still... it hardly gave me any faith in Milla's career as a dramatic performer.",/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2017,Randomizer2600,10," A different take on an old story, really enjoyed it.
","This is not a movie I would have chosen, but Director Luc Besson has ""Valerian"" coming out soon, and this movie was mentioned in a review. There are reviews written by people with far greater knowledge. I have a casual understanding of the story of Joan of Arc, and know less about the events of the time. As a movie, I enjoyed this immensely. This movie gets the people right.",/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2001,Dockelektro,9," She never shined so much
","We are already used to the original depictions Lus Besson did of humans on screen. How would he do with real events this time? I'm happy to say he suceeded. We are somewhat used to the regular ""automatic pilot"" depictions of Joan's life, the woman who loved god above all things and believed she was sent to save her people from the clutches of the British. But here we are entitled to a much more personal point of view: Besson's eye for Milla is particularly sensible, and we notice she as a particular shine no other character has. Therefore, we establish an empathy with her which starts even when she is only a child. The movie has a great period detail, and some incredible sequences, but, for some reason, it is the film by Besson that grabbed me the least, I can't explain why, although that isn't saying that I didn't like. In fact, I think there are things about this movie I haven't seen nowhere else, specially all the scenes where Joan hallucinates and has visions of God. This movie is totally different from all medieval adventures we have seen so far, and its shots are Luc Besson's own. The all-stellar cast helps a lot, and Dustin Hoffman turn out welcome at the end. The battle scenes are a wow!Thierry Arboghast's cinematography helps a lot to establish a cool look of medieval times, specially when fire is concerned. Eric Serra's score reaches depth levels he has never reached before. A great film altogether, which deserves to be seen with the heart willing to take whatever we get from it. The title song ""My Heart Calling"" is one of the most beautiful Eric Serra wrote for the movies. I recommend it for Besson fans who will like certainly, and to all the others who aren't, just for the fun of a different depiction of Joan's life.",/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2000,OldRose,10," Beyond all expectations...!
","Milla Jovovich may have been the only woman who could have portrayed a 'Joan' believable enough for such a film and approach as that taken by Luc Besson, one which stops just short of suggesting some sort of 'shamanic visionary' as opposed to a character labelled everything from 'deranged schizophrenic' to 'lesbian', simply due to attire, while 'hearing voices' (all historical facts). The key ingredient: the eyes. Not since Faye Dunnaway's unforgetable portrayal in ""The Eyes of Laura Mars"" (1976), who coincidentally co-stars as an excellent Yolande d'Aragon herewith, has someone captivated an audience simply by a look or a glance. Spell-binding, riveting, and as true to the historical record as one can expect for this most noble of French heroines, while adding a plausible childhood, Besson, Jovovich, an excellent supporting cast and the film were all but ignored for the honours they so richly deserved.  Rating five stars (of five) and a film I'll never forget!",/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 1999,DClarke-2,10," Who has the words to contain the power of this film?
","If Milla Jovovich does not receive an Academy Award as well as the film garnering the Palm D'or at Cannes, then I will be absolutely shocked. This is a movie with such terrible impact that half the audience was in tears. I can not speak to the authenticity of the history but anyone will see that the theme and message were crystal clear.  A must see. Without reservation, I can give this film a rating of 10 and I thought that I'd never do anything so extreme, but this film deserves a 10.",/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2005,step2ice,10," very impressive and intelligent leap in time
","Joan of Arc the legend which was described as saint, warrior, frantic, heretic etc. is brilliantly played by Milla Jovovich. This movie isn't the typical hero stuff you would expect. It has many sides to think of and gives you space to make your own thoughts about the character Joan of Arc. And that is exactly what I liked the most about the movie. You can almost feel what this very young woman must have felt to be on the battlefield at this age, fighting for her vision, faith or whatever it was. Intoxicated by the battles and her mission to fight the war for god, for France. ",/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2002,SamRag,9," Sometime it is great to be surprised
","I wanted to see this one at the movies, but after hearing it was no good from what I considered good sources, I decided against it.  Having seen it at the DVD-rental store many times, often almost grabbing it, but deciding against it remembering how horrible it was supposed to be.  Finally one day, finding nothing else, I rented it.  And I loved it!  It is great, finding jewels unexpectedly like this, as when one watches as many films as I do, the only great films you see are the newest ones.  After watching it, I went to the user comment area here on IMDb and tried to find out why people have given it such low rating.  Further more, this was an Oscar performance from Milla Jovovich, but apparently the film wasn't even nominated (based on what I can see here on IMDb).  This film is in the category, `either you get it, or you don't', or `either you love it or hate it'.  I didn't know anything about Joan of Arc, and maybe that is why I liked it, watching it as a film rather then historical documentary.  The film leaves me with a comfortable feeling.  Before I watched it, I was afraid that we would see some saint of a woman, and how un-human and holy she was in what she did.  Instead we see a young woman, plagued with the notion of purpose, extreme determination, while never fully understanding why or what is happening.  Joan of Arc is much more of a hero to me after seeing this film, because the film is about her as a woman, rather then some supernatural being. 9/10",/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2013,relars1,9," Well Done
","A briskly-paced Bio of Joan of Arc, including numerous graphic battle scenes. Characters portrayed ""With The Bark On"" - soldiers of both English and French forces covered in mud, with horribly rotten teeth and decorated with scars - probably what people really looked like, in the early 1400s. Other scenes adding Realism include watching people eat food (something you don't normally see, in movies). Whatever they ate, it came from a boiling pot - broth, some chunks of veggies and whatever meat might be had...again, the unusual portrayal of common people eating was deliberate, and added ""Texture"" to the surroundings.",/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you are wondering about Luc Besson's vaguely heretical ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"", try to imagine a cross between ""Excalibur"" and ""Heaven's Gate"". It looks great but the basic story gets lost in the histrionics and excess. ",/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 1999,Jack-91,8," Milla was simply breathtaking as Joan
",Some movies would probably try to make a more divine spirit out of Joan but at least Besson examines all possibilities as regards to what inspired her. I think it was as honest a film you could make about Joan. Her quest for revenge combined with tremendous belief in the forces above that ignited her fire. Through Dustin Hoffman the viewer can question her motives and get her response. And what a performance! Milla was simply breathtaking as Joan.,/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2001,Roemer,9," Brilliant Screenplay
","A very clever screenplay: theologically, psychologically, historically and dramatically almost perfect. You can look at the story of Joan of Arc in all these four ways and Besson did it all four ways. And made a movie that satisfies you and makes you wonder, no matter which of the four is your favorite.",/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 1999,Travis-33,," An amazing movie
","I loved this movie. It's visually stunning and the casting and acting was superb. The story was already layed out (approximately), so Luc Besson concentrated on Jeanne herself, the person and what she was like and why she did what she did.",/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv

2 October 2003,kidgloves,9," Great all round movie
",I absolutely love this movie. I remember the reviews being harsh at the time of release which was expected considering the subject matter. Personally i always get something out of Luc Besson films as they are so beautiful to look at with sweeping camera shots that give an epic feel and this is no different. The humour contrasts very well with some shocking scenes that balance the film very well. Credit must also be given to the costume and set crew as the attention to detail is fantastic. This is a film to get lost in (like any good film in my view) and enjoy.,/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2000,TxMike,," An epic portrayal of Joan of Arc, fine writing, directing, acting make this a real rewarding film.
","Let me preface my comments for ""The Messenger"" by stating that I am a Catholic who grew up in the 50s, and my home parish was ""St Joan of Arc."" Not only that, but when my children were growing up, in a different place, our church was also ""St Joan of Arc"".

11 September 2014,KingBrian1,8," Descent and Fair take on a Patriotric Frenchwomen
",This movie is a descent historical interpretation of the events of the French wars with England as seen through the prism of the deeply devout Joan of Arc. With all its movie sensationalism I wish to believe that at the heart of the film is the view that a patriotic young girl fought to save her country from rape and ravine at the hands of invaders. This might seem to most naïve as the French were just as violent as the English and the notion that Joan was incapable of cruelty is hard for many to see.,/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 1999,Kusanagi,1," eeeeh
","I cannot fathom some of the glowing reviews this film is receiving.  I really, really, REALLY didn't like this movie at all. Don't get me wrong, I've always found Joan of Arc to be a fascinating historical figure.  But why on earth did she have to be portrayed like someone on *****?  More than anything, I'm just disappointed at this film for the way it was made.  I feel that there was so much more that could have been done, but the lousy dialogue and poor directing just made seeing this film a bad experience.",/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7," Not the greatest war movie, but a good movie, and a somewhat true-to-facts portrayal of Jeanne d'Arc
","Luc Besson usually makes spectacular movies; Leon, The Fifth Element, etc. Joan of Arc is no exception. It details the life of Jeanne, the maiden of Lorraine, who in and around the year 1431, helped France defeat England, and win a war that has lasted for almost an entire century. The plot is great, and it has a very good pace. I am almost never bored when watching this film, despite the fact that it's fairly long(about two and a half hours long), and I've seen it at least half a dozen times. What I've found to be great about the film is the re-watchable quality it has; I've seen it many times, yet I haven't grown tired of it. Up to the very end, it always has a scene or two that you can look forward to, either because it's exceptionally well done, has very good cinematography, has great acting and/or dialog, or every one of those qualities. The acting is great. Every single actor gives a great performance, even the child actors were convincing. The performances that impressed me the most, however, were those of Milla Jovovich and Dustin Hoffman, as Jeanne and her conscience, respectively. They never cease to amaze me. The characters were well-written and credible. I particularly liked the way Jeanne was written as having a very notable temper and being very decisive. I also very much enjoyed the various supporting characters, the best being La Hire and The Conscience. I liked the way the film seems to question Jeanne's sanity; whereas most believe that she *was* in fact, sent by God, this film sits down and asks the question, if she really was, or if the signs and miracles weren't all in her head, and caused by everyone wanting to believe it. The very last scenes especially puts doubt in the viewer. It was quite a gutsy move by Besson, to question his own country's hero. I will admit, the film does really make it seem more like she is crazy rather than sent by God, but it doesn't feel like Besson is pushing his view onto us, telling us that that's the way it was; it feels more like he tries to make us question it. The action and the war scenes were very well done, very chaotic and disturbing, very intense and bloody. This isn't the best war movie ever made, nor is it the most factually accurate; it might not even be the best retelling of the legend of Jeanne d'Arc. But I have found it to be a thoroughly enjoyable, well-acted, well-choreographed, well-done film that makes you think. And that's good enough for me. Several scenes are quite memorable, as are some of the lines. All in all, a very enjoyable war-drama, with an authentic story and some well-done battle sequences. I recommend it to fans of the actors, of Luc Besson's other work and of war movies/dramas in general. Just don't expect a full-out war movie; it's two hours and thirty minutes long, and I don't think more than forty-five minutes in total are spent fighting. 7/10",/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2018,Tweetienator,8," Great Epic
","The strong performances by Milla Jovovich and the others make this one a great movie about the legendary Joan of Arc.
