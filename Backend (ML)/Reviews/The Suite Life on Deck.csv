","Unfortunately I was unable to deeply connect to the characters emotionally. Although the cinematography was excellent, I felt that the movie relied too heavily on it and it wasn't enough to carry the movie. I feel that it was the script/story that felt too simplified. It felt rushed and edited to pieces....and just not thorough enough.",/review/rw8742181/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. Persistence. It's the word used to describe ""runners"" by the man known for tracking the slaves who try to escape the abusive treatment and back-breaking work of plantations. However, the word can also be used to describe how the movie industry 'persists' in bringing us stories about how white slave owners created a brutal environment for black slaves. We really do get it. The history is awful and the treatment is inexcusable. It's just difficult to understand how more movies are going to make any difference in what happened 150 years ago.",/review/rw8742181/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2022,Xstal,6," Run For Your Life...
","It's nothing you haven't seen before, but that doesn't mean that it's a chore, reflecting on past wrongs and crimes, should be done all of the time, especially, as there are those who don't abhor; here we journey in the mire, the swamps that inflict pain and tire, to escape the evil clutches of the whip, the gun, dog judges, through a world that's cruel and dire, freedom's something you acquire, but you're more likely to win, a back of waves and rippled skin.",/review/rw8742181/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2022,ajfalco19,6," Ok at best
","It makes no sense that the ""masters"" spent so much time chasing the slaves only to just kill them off, rather than trying to get them back to their camp. A large majority of the movie is of Peter running through the swamp while the dogs chasing him are right on his tail, yet not close enough. I thought the acting played by will smith was subpar and the movie dragged. They could've made the film 20 minutes shorter and taken out a lot of the running around. Although the movie moved slowly, I still find this time in history to be shocking and it was interesting to see how it played out. Overall, ok at best.",/review/rw8742181/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,sosrivi,7," Why so much hatred for this Movie???
","Well, I really enjoyed the film. It is a story about survival, freedom and individual self-confidence. Will Smith's performance was amazing. Odds of winning a Oscar for his performance is very high. Good cinematography, unique color correction and a brilliant stunt sequence.",/review/rw8742181/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2022,antoniatejedabarros,10," A masterpiece about slavery, courage and survival, with a stunningly brilliant performance by Will Smith
","Emancipation is a masterpiece about slavery, courage, dignity, love, irrational hate, and survival. Will Smith's performance is absolutely breathtaking: brilliant, exquisite, and full of sorrow and depth. The rest of the cast, especially Charmaine Bingwa, is great too. The cinematography (Robert Richardson: who is also the cinematographer of Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained, Once Upon a Time in...Hollywood) is fantastic, and the direction (Antoine Fuqua) is brilliant. There are some very cruel and very hard scenes to watch, and I missed a bit of depth in some of the characters, but overall this is a brilliant film about one of the most horrific injustices and cruelties that human beings have produced. A must see. Bravo to all. 10/10.",/review/rw8742181/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2022,gravloc,6," It's ok.
","My biggest complaint is the choice to go black and white, but a really weird looking black and white. It almost looks like it was shot on a cellphone. It's really distracting from trying to actually get into the movie. It was just a really bad choice in my opinion. I like pretty much everything Antoine Fuqua has ever made. Unfortunately, this is probably meant to be the most profound work he has ever done, and it's just not. It's really well made, and well acted, and technically proficient. It just doesn't have the impact that I think it's meant to have, which is disappointing. Plus, Ben Foster is a great actor, but I think he needs to move on from being the go to bad guy. However, the weird choice of the strange looking black and white, or whatever it is I was looking at was what really took me out of the experience the most. Oh well, overall it wasn't bad.",/review/rw8742181/?ref_=tt_urv

10 December 2022,neonrt-492-48717,3," Too much coincidence
","I know they have to move the movie along but him running into his friends in the swamp after they separated was a bit unrealistic. Also there being a horse trail every 5 feet in a swamp. And the fact the guy on the horse was like 30 seconds behind him but never caught up to him, them left only to be behind him later. Then the burning house, he walks straight up to it, then once inside takes 10 min to walk with a strange stance in one room. He never picks up a gun or a dry pair of boots. 2 dogs vanish from the chase the moment it was time to shoot a dog. The alligator fought like a pool toy. He never looks in the boxes on the beach. The cannons were doing no damage compared to the guns but were the main focus. He yells and yells for his wife 3 feet to the left. Who with only 20 men there she should have noticed him. There were too many ""wait what? "" moments in the movie for me to not be removed from what I am watching .",/review/rw8742181/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2022,nukem4747,6," Black and white....
","Not a reference to the subject matter, but the cinematography. I get it... I get that sometimes black and white, or in this case, extremely low level of color saturation allowed, can, and has been used in an artistic way. But for the life of me, I cannot understand why such a masterpiece was done in it. This was a great movie. Great content. Great story, and based on a true story at that. WHY ON EARTH DID YOU SCREW IT UP BY REMOVING THE COLOR???? An otherwise fantastic piece. But ruined by sucking the life out of it. The imagery, and immersion that is created by films like this is wonderful. But due to no color, I felt completely disassociated from the plight of Peter. It was really hard to even stay in my seat to finish it. Stop it.... get some help...",/review/rw8742181/?ref_=tt_urv

25 December 2022,amca1960,6," Too long for its story
","It's very hard to make a film about slavery without either trivializing it or glamorizing it. Or just as bad, glorifying its violence. This film sets the serious tone by its careful not quite black and white cinematography. For me, this worked extremely well, although it did have the effect of making some scenes more confusing and harder to see.",/review/rw8742181/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2022,Neptune165,3," Was not a fan of the desaturated cinematography
","I thought the writing was shallow and the story definitely was written for a voyeur audience. The directing, cinematography, and score are great. Will Smith wasn't special in this. The supporting actors were stronger imo. I'm sorry but I'm so tired of movies like these. At this point they're just profiting off of real life horror stories. And they serve no purpose other than to piss you off. Yeah, I'm one of the people of the belief that we don't necessarily need more slave films. However...I agree about needing the education that can be had from a slave movie BUT...only when there is something relevant, enlightening and new. Otherwise, it's just another....slave story.",/review/rw8742181/?ref_=tt_urv

","I love IMDB and use the ratings as my guide to Whether a movie deserves my time to watch it. So glad I didn't check before watching this. Is it a 10? Obviously not but come on, 5.8 (at time of review), that's just insulting. I've seen far crapier movies with far higher ratings. This should be rated in the sevens for sure.

",Why this film got bad reviews i don't know. Amazing acting by Will Smith and Ben Foster. I can see Will Smith getting another Oscar for this. Brilliant film beautiful shoot threw out of the movie. Will Smith pulls of another amazing acting in this movie. The cast in this movie all pull of there parts brilliantly. I be shocked if this film doesn't get any awards or Oscar for this. This movie is well worth watching. Its hard and gritty but tells the truth of one man spirit that wont be broken the love for his family.

","There really isn't anything special about this movie. Are the performances good? I mean, sure yeah the performances are pretty good but other than that this movie doesn't really show anything we haven't seen before. Now for obvious reasons this movie is going to be over hyped during awards season and I was honestly expecting to be blown away by it, but when it was over, honestly I was bit underwhelmed. I'd give the movie a solid 6.8 outta 10. It spent way too much time with him escaping and then only about 30 minutes of when he became a soldier and actually helped fight in the civil war. I feel like if they spent more time as him as a solider the movie would have been more effective.",/review/rw8742181/?ref_=tt_urv
