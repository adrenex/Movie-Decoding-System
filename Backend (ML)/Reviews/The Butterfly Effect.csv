","You will never hear the devil's viewpoint argued better than in and by The Devil's Advocate. Although Keanu Reeves holds his own in this film, this piece of cinema is an Al Pacino show.",/review/rw0412924/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2002,Special-K88,," this is how you make a thriller
","Stylish, sexy, suspenseful thriller stars Reeves as an accomplished southern lawyer who's never been beaten; he travels to New York City to take a job with powerful legal mogul Pacino, but his once ideal life is soon turned upside down as he's plunged into a surreal, demonic world of lust, temptation, and vanity. Slick writing, direction, and an array of startling scenes, breathtaking effects, and dazzling performances make this an imaginative thriller quite unlike any other. Reeves gives one of his finest performances to date, aided immeasurably by a wild, wickedly over-the-top performance from Pacino and a first-rate supporting cast. Not for all tastes, but highly watchable indeed. ***Â½",/review/rw0412924/?ref_=tt_urv

1 April 2005,ereinion,9," A beguiling experience
","This is one of the most intensely dark and beguiling movies I have seen. The purpose behind it is to create a moral drama about the fight between good and evil in a man, or the devil's everlasting quest to conquer man's soul. In retrospective, there are few movies I've seen that bring out such strong feelings in me. Specially the first hour. We follow a young couple, played by Reeves and Theron in her first big picture, who move to New York from the south when he is given a job as attorney in one of the biggest firms in the country. We see the change come in Kevin as he is introduced to a world of luxury and pleasure by his boss, THE DEVIL, played by old master Al Pacino.",/review/rw0412924/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2002,bsamdahl,9," Vanity, my favorite sin
","The Devil's advocate is one of those movies you watch the first time just to see the climax, then with repeated viewing you pick up on the message of humanity and sin.  Al Pacino plays the role of Satan in a very powerful and believable manner. The exchange between Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino towards the end of the film may upset a few people's religious beliefs. Al Pacino as Satan really makes you think and nod your head in agreement.  Warning....Al Pacino is so convincing he may make some people start questioning their own beliefs.  Keanu Reeves is at his best when confronting Satan as if he is playing poker with him. In the end he succumbs to vanity as all humans do from time to time.  I think that Keanu portrayed the stages of Kevin Lomax well. He goes from a small town southern lawyer who never questions why he never loses a case, to a big city attorney who hears revelations from his mother about his father and sees his wife commit suicide. In the end, Kevin Lomax uses one of Satan's lines, ""free will"", against him.  This is an excellent film worth seeing again and again.",/review/rw0412924/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2014,v_haritha_in,7," I saw the Devil!
","This movie addresses the old question; is a lawyer doing the right thing by defending a criminal. However, it finds a novel way of presenting its idea. Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves)is a young and successful attorney, in fact so successful that, as we are reminded time and again in the movie, he has never lost a case. He takes up the case of a man who is accused of molesting a child, thinking that he is innocent. Midway through the case, Lomax discovers that the man is in fact guilty and though he is a little disturbed, he helps secure the man's acquittal. Thus, he begins selling his soul to the Devil, both figuratively and literally. ",/review/rw0412924/?ref_=tt_urv

","When Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves in a very good turn) is lured to New York City to work for the powerful and persuasive John Milton (Al Pacino in one of the best performances of his career), the world is his oyster. He has a dream job (given to him because as a defense lawyer he has never lost a case), a beautiful wife (Charlize Theron in head-turning performance), and a luxury apartment (which his wife nearly drives herself crazy trying to decorate).",/review/rw0412924/?ref_=tt_urv

20 September 2020,filipemanuelneto,10," An extraordinary film with a great cast and one of the best interpretations of the Devil I've ever seen in the movies.
","It's always a pleasure to see this film. Its one of those films that makes us think and that touches on one interesting theme: the eternal struggle between Good and Evil, between God and his eternal enemy, the Devil. And this film gives us, precisely, the best interpretation of the Prince of Evil that cinema has ever seen!",/review/rw0412924/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2004,antoniotierno,," one of the greatest movies to come along in the last ten years
","I can hardly find words to express how grand this film is; superb acting and story, with lot of action, drama and emotion. Director certainly mounted a gorgeous movie, displaying great talent to deal with the theme of men making a terrible deal with devil (though involuntarily)in exchange for money, success and all that stuff. Extremely realistic, never slowing down with one twist after another. Serious, scary and witty all in one, it captures the essence of degrading social values and overrated success of nowadays society. In terms of acting, Al Pacino's rendition of Satana is simply awesome, over the top, a role played to near perfection. Charlize Theron, wonderful, does a good job in playing the forever loving wife, breaking down as soon she starts discovering the truth; the only one a bit disappointing is Keanu Reeves, not that much realistic and believable.",/review/rw0412924/?ref_=tt_urv

At a point, It was as if I could see my jaw on the floor praising in thorough amusement the brilliance, relevance-to-our-daily-lives, deepness of message, sophistication, great portrayal, top-of-the-class creativity, marvelous acting/directing/screen writing all having come together in a movie, which called for a rating of 9 out of 10 and no less, certainly, undoubtedly.",/review/rw0412924/?ref_=tt_urv

30 January 2018,Bored_Dragon,10," One of my all time favorites
","In my opinion,this is one of the best movies of all time. I'm shocked that it has no Oscar nominations. Pacino definitely deserves one for almost every movie he was in. But it won Saturn award for the best horror... really?! Horror?! In which universe is this movie a horror?! It's drama, it may pass for thriller or mystery, but to say it's horror is complete nonsense. I suppose everyone saw this movie, but to those who saw it just once I recommend watching it again, because this movie is full of ingenious lines that in first watching mostly pass unnoticed, because without knowing how movie ends they seem casual and irrelevant, and they're not. In spite of the fact that the main role is entrusted to Keanu Reeves, the story and other actors are so strong that the film is a pure",/review/rw0412924/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2010,weckker,10," astonishing then, astonishing now
","I saw this movie back in '97 in the theatre. It was running just a week after Cameron's Titanic. I remember the crowds that rushed to see Titanic, and an almost empty room when this movie was playing. After seeing this I thought how unbalanced is this creativity (originality) vs big budget blockbusters on one side, and the number of viewers on the other side. Later I realised that blockbusters are for the masses, and interesting movies like this one are for the few who can see beyond the FX and the small little girls tears. I was just a kid back then. I watched it again last night. And although I knew the ending, it was an awesome ride, and the ending gave me the same shivers as the fist time. If you haven't seen this one - go get it, if you have - watch it again. It never gets old, nor boring.",/review/rw0412924/?ref_=tt_urv

2 April 2006,lee_eisenberg,7," I will definitely have to see this again.
","Movies about people getting involved with the Devil are quite common, but Al Pacino's deadpan performance makes this one especially cool. True, Keanu Reeves is a strange choice for a person who started out in Florida - especially since he still sounds like the guy from the ""Bill & Ted"" movies"" - but he also does a good job. I am going to have to watch ""The Devil's Advocate"" again, just to see where...well, you'll see what I mean if you watch it. When this movie came out, I had never heard of Charlize Theron (although she had already starred in ""That Thing You Do!""), but she showed the same chops that she would later bring to ""Monster"" and such movies. All in all, a really cool movie; you may never look at anything the same way again after watching this.",/review/rw0412924/?ref_=tt_urv

","What a surprisingly rewarding film. I have not watched a film that is so engaging for a long while. I had never even heard of the film before and only saw it by chance on the shelf at the video store. I am glad I picked it up as I enjoyed every minute of it. The Devil's advocate is heavy viewing, it is not a light cinema experience, yet it is rewarding in it's heaviness. It is very clever depicting the devil realistically and giving a totally truthful example of how people can un-knowingly be sucked in by evil. The film though dealing with a unrealistic concept is totally believable due the the fantastic acting by all involved. Keanu Reeves gives the performance of a life time, he is perfectly cast opposite Charliez Theron who is also very impressive. The two posses an obvious chemistry. I recommend you see this movie ASAP!",/review/rw0412924/?ref_=tt_urv

","I don't think you could put this movies in a particular catagory. It's not quite a drama and it's not quite a thriller but a bit of both. Both the movie is good, for instead of making the devil just a blood thirsty killer, it's based on temptation. Al Pacino lives in a world of beautiful women, money, power, and no guilt. There is a lot of nudity and extreme violence in this movie, but if it wasn't there the movies purpose and story wouldn't work. The final half of this movie put me in more suspense then any movie has in a long time. In conclusion, don't miss this film.",/review/rw0412924/?ref_=tt_urv
