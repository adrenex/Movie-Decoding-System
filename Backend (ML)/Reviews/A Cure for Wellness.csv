6 May 2021,feyipuk,3," Stop using Tom Clancys name if it's not Clancy!
","I haven't read Without Remorse, yet considering Amazon started business selling books, why can't the writers of these productions read one if they're going to say it's based on one! Tom Clancy was the master of the techno-thriller, mixing elements of science fiction, political thriller and spy genres, albeit Clancys extensive research helped readers understand foreign militaries and his plots eerily echoed real events to the degree rumours circulated the CIA thought he was a mole.",/review/rw6870794/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2021,rikakiah-68522,1," Either make a Clancy movie or don't
","As a generic soldier/spy movie, this isn't horrible. I'd give it maybe a 6--don't expect much, but it has entertaining moments. As a Tom Clancy movie, based on a book with established characters and canon, a 1 isn't a low enough rating. It has nothing to do with the book, and little to do with the Clancy universe beyond a couple of names. It's nothing more than a cheap cash grab using the Clancy name. People need to either come up with original IPs, or at least attempt to stick a little closer to the namesake material.",/review/rw6870794/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2021,Cineanalyst,3," Someone Should be Remorseful for This
","A generic shoot-'em-up that Hollywood used to do with Westerns ever since they began making movies. It doesn't matter that there's the military, espionage and geopolitical conspiracies involved in the Tom Clancy variation on the formula; it's always the same thing. The baddie and his red herring are so obvious that one of them might as well be wearing a black hat. But, sure, the action is standard, if darkly lit, and Michael B. Jordan fits the part of a muscular star to recognizably pose between the rest of the interchangeable tropes. Maybe you'll even find ""Without Remorse"" a bit fun with him not playing by the rules, out for revenge as he is. For crying out loud, we even get a mid-credits scene setting up a franchise.",/review/rw6870794/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2021,World-viewer,1," Without a point
","If the entire crew involved in the production of this abomination have no remorse, they ought to have. Plenty of remorse. For subjecting an already traumatized public to this collection of pixelized garbage. This silly shoot'em-up deserves to be taken out back, shot (without remorse) and buried in an anonymous plot, never to be mentioned again ... or quarantined forever in Yucca Mountain along with all other radioactive waste.",/review/rw6870794/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2021,d.e.katz,1," A Bomb
","This is one of the worst movies ever made. The plot (what little there was of it) made no sense at all. I'm all for the willing suspension of disbelief when watching an adventure yarn, but this movie requires the viewer to suspend all knowledge of the real world--and it isn't a science fiction movie.",/review/rw6870794/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2021,demoxpert,1," Sorry Tom
","This could not have been a bigger disappointment it they tried. Tom Clancy deserves much better. This can't even be called an adaptation, because it had nothing to do with the novel. The acting was wooden the plot was weak and ludicrous and even MBJ seemed to be phoning it in, which I am very sorry to say. The technical inaccuracies made it difficult to even enjoy the action, which really wasn't that enjoyable anyway. Basically, this could have been a better movie if they had left it to a couple of shaved wombats for writing and directing. As a John Clark fan from way back, it was the absolute worst way that they could have told his story. MBJ could have knocked it out of the park if he had something better to work with.",/review/rw6870794/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2021,mparam-00226,1," Total disappointment
","Except some action sequences, nothing is good in this movie. There is no screen play and no story. Don't waste your time!!",/review/rw6870794/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2021,lfc357,2," Clancy is spinning in his grave
",This is an utterly embarrassing interpretation of the book. Literally nothing is right except a few of the names. Would have been a five star movie without the Clancy name connection.,/review/rw6870794/?ref_=tt_urv

",This movie was made 'without remorse'.,/review/rw6870794/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2021,Xstal,3," Without Prime or Reason...
","Catastrophically chaotic, cobbled and as dull as dishwater - what a waste of great talent as a wholly unoriginal, irrelevant and out of touch tale of yesteryear flails and drowns in its own juices - glug glug glug.",/review/rw6870794/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2021,ebaker-63744,1," Terrible waste of my time and yours!
","The script writers should be ashamed of themselves. I read all of Clancy's books and have always loved without remorse. This movie has only two things correct to the book:
1: The main characters name is John Kelly/Clark
2: He is/was a Navy SEAL.",/review/rw6870794/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2021,chippysmyth,1," If you can ignore the fact that it bears no resemblance to the book...
",This is STILL a terrible film.,/review/rw6870794/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2021,SoumikBanerjee25,2," The Character of John Clark Deserved Better!
","With its formulaic modus operandi, ""Without Remorse"" tragically conveyed the feel of true Remorse. Amazon Studio's latest venture into Tom Clancy's universe turned out to be a colossal disappointment! Atrocious Writing, Mediocre Performances, and Conspicuous Enfeeblement in terms of presenting its Action made the entire experience bitterer!",/review/rw6870794/?ref_=tt_urv

1 May 2021,tspike911,1," Another good book destroyed by hollywood
","I think this is why Tom Clancy didn't allow this book to be made into a film while he was alive, he knew that hollywood would destroy it (and they did).",/review/rw6870794/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2021,rhodeosc,1," AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Awful awful awful. The acting and writing are mediocre at best. Did they even talk to seals before this crap. Sorry, there are no girls in the Navy Seals. What a sad attempt to look progressive and appease the current offended generation. Her acting was a joke also.",/review/rw6870794/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2021,markusshahn,2," Why name it like a great book, if it has nothing to do with it?
",Without Remorse is probably my favorite Tom Clancy book - imagine my excitement when I see it's been turned into a movie and then my utter disappointment after realizing that the only thing this movie has in common with the book are the title and the names of a few characters.,/review/rw6870794/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2021,kcp1062,2," Huge disappointment
","I don't even know why Tom Clancy and his estate sold the rights to his books. The only movie that did justice to his books is Hunt for Red October. Other than that the movies have just got worse and worse. Especially this movie, other than the main character John Clark being a Navy Seal there is nothing in this movie that comes even close to the book. Seriously, this movie isn't worth the time.",/review/rw6870794/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2021,lee_eisenberg,4," interesting story, ridiculous movie
","I wouldn't put it past the CIA to do what they do in ""Without Remorse"", but the movie degenerates into a series of explosions, weakening any positive qualities.",/review/rw6870794/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2021,rsvp321,," Uh-oh

30 April 2021,lrm-33361,2," Disappointed... Not a Tom Clancy story.
",I loved Tom Clancy books and movies growing up and I always wanted them to make Without Remorse into a movie since the book was so good. I was thoroughly disappointed. The only commonality are some of the characters and the title. They could have just changed the character names and the title and not claim this to be a Tom Clancy film. Either stick with the plot of the books and do them justice or don't claim to do a Tom Clancy film. The plot they did use instead was stale and not what I would expect for a major release. It was more in the direct to DVD league.,/review/rw6870794/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2021,rncxwnxm,1," Stolen identity
","The name was there and I expected the story to be abridged, possibly significantly to a 2021 version but really? This was nothing at all like the story, not even a little. It was like they took a random and not very good story and thought they could just use a few characters names to make it a Clancy. In my opinion the best book in the series and the very worst film. Disappointing.",/review/rw6870794/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2021,Donnie_Quixotic,1," Remorseful Waste of Time
","It's not an ""A"" movie and it's not a ""B"" movie. It's a TV-ish ""D"" movie wannabe, with bad acting (including Jordan's flat and sometimes overacted, non-nuanced performance), bad directing, flat generic cinematography and sound, and boring, amateurish script.",/review/rw6870794/?ref_=tt_urv
