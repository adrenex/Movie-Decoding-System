25 February 2015,claudio_carvalho,7," Creepy and Dark Exorcism Movie
","In New York, Police Officer Ralph Sarchie (Eric Bana) and his partner Butler (Joel McHale) investigate a series of bizarre crimes in Bronx: the death of a baby in an alley: the beating of the wife of the former soldier Jimmy (Chris Coy) by him; and the case of a mother, Jane Crenna (Olivia Horton), who has thrown her two year old son in the enclosure of the lions in the zoo. While investigating the last case with Butler, Sarchie sees a weird man painting the wall of the lion's enclosure but he flees. Soon the man is identified, Mick Santino (Sean Harris), and Sarchie learns that Santino and Jimmy belonged to the same platoon in Iraq. The investigation affects the private life of Sarchie and his relationship with his wife Jennifer ""Jen"" (Olivia Munn) and his daughter Christina (Lulu Wilson). Sarchie, who is a Catholic that lost his faith, is contacted by the unconventional Father Mendoza (Édgar Ramírez) that explains to him that he is dealing with demonic forces and Santini and Jane are possessed by demons. The skeptic Sarchie does not believe in the father in the beginning, but when his family is jeopardized by Santino, he teams-up with the priest to exorcise Santino and save his beloved family.",/review/rw3105555/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2016,Reno-Rangan,7," An unusual team of two to fight the evil spirits!
","This was based on the real account. A cop from the New York who witnessed those unexplained events are what this film depicted for us. I think it is slightly an underrated film. Not because of true story, but from the entertainment perspective. From the beginning till the end, I enjoyed watching it. Horror means there's no big scary stuff in it, still being true to the genre, it told a decent story. It was well written and directed, a film that I almost missed, but now I can gladly suggest it to the others. But it is just an above average, yet worth a watch.",/review/rw3105555/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2018,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,6," Initially engaging but falls short as time goes on
","Filmmaker Scott Derrickson has definitely been through a lot when it comes to movies even if he hasn't output a large volume. He's also been through several areas of the movie industry; everything from home video, independent to mainstream blockbuster studios. And of course now that he's been inducted into the family of Marvel Studios, his credibility has been more or less confirmed. Prior to this though he was still trying to make a name for himself in way that would make him stand out. While The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008) remake was boring for most, his comeback with Sinister (2012) turned the tables in his favor. While Sinister (2012) did engage its audience at the beginning, the predictability became fairly obvious as time went on. Sadly it seems as though Derrickson did not notice this when he released this movie as his next feature.",/review/rw3105555/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2019,Sleepin_Dragon,9," Not what I expected at all.
","I don't know why I was expecting something bad. I've watched so many horror films, that my expectations have plummeted. I loved this, absolutely brilliant, dare I say it, it's even a bit on the scary side.",/review/rw3105555/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2014,alucard_castlevania86,9," Personally My Pick of The Month
","The moment I saw the names Eric Bana (Hulk 2003) and Edgar Ramirez (Wrath of The Titans), I knew that I just had to go and see this film. I've seen this film twice now and boy I enjoyed it very, very much. I've always liked movies involving evil and demonology since the plot, effects, action and suspense are always entertaining to watch",/review/rw3105555/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2014,fatemaster2003,8," The Right Kind of Exorcism
","It's been a while since I found a decent exorcism movie. I mean, some of the exorcism-theme movies I've watched is pretty decent if not too ordinary. Too similar with the process and the pace. So, when I see that Deliver Us From Evil has arrived, I too didn't really put up too much hope. I thought this is just another typical exorcism movie.",/review/rw3105555/?ref_=tt_urv

","A cop and a rabbi are touring the streets. Sounds like the beginning of a joke doesn't it, but no it is the focus of the plot of one of this weekend's releases. Now being 4th of July weekend you might expect a comedy, a heroic feature, or some patriotic film. However, not once did I expect a horror film to open up the month of July. Today I start my review trilogy with Deliver Us From Evil, starring Eric Bana and Édgar Ramírez. Let's get started.",/review/rw3105555/?ref_=tt_urv

11 October 2014,sonekken,5," nothing we haven't seen before
","There is absolutely nothing original about this film. The acting isn't bad at all, but the plot is very generic. For the hardcore horror lover the movie will get boring and predictable, you've got the cop with some issues, you've got the priest know knows what's happening, you've got the cop's family with the little girl, the entire plot is a deja-vu.",/review/rw3105555/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2014,A_Different_Drummer,7," Above average, but oddly flawed..
","And here is an irony: the flaws I believe are due to the length (overlong by about half an hour, which is a lifetime for feature) and the length is due to the pedigree, ie, this is a Jerry Bruckheimer production and no way Jerry was going to let one of his pet projects get cut at 90 minutes (which would have placed it in the same category as the B films, the ""found footage"" films, and the direct-to-video jobs).",/review/rw3105555/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2014,dwinchester1996,8," One of the best exorcism type movies I've watched in a while.
","This is by far one of the best exorcism type movies I've watched in a very long time. The whole tune of the movie as it progresses is cryptic, and keeps you longing for more. Always trying to figure it out on your own as the movie plays on. Most exorcism type movies drag on with the plot and lose me halfway in, but this one however kept me entertained throughout the entire time. Eric Bana's acting is top quality, and quite frankly the best acting I've saw of him since ""Troy"". It's def. something to look into, if your looking for a good movie to watch. Be it Drama/Horror/Mystery, this movie is for you. You cannot do split rankings on here, but I give it a good 8.5/10 score.",/review/rw3105555/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2015,Wizard-8,," Too slow and drawn out
","Though I usually keep in regular touch with what movies are being widely released to theaters, somehow I didn't hear of this movie when it was in theaters, so when I came across the Blu-ray I was quite surprised to learn of it. But to be honest, after watching it, I thought the movie should have stayed in obscurity. It's not the worst horror movie I've seen, but it has some major problems. For starters, the movie raises a lot of unanswered questions, like how the hero was able to view footage shot by the military. But the main problem with the movie is how tiresome it is. It moves very slowly, and the moments of horror that occasionally happen have a ""been there done that"" kind of feeling. These problems are made worse by a running time of almost two hours in length - this story didn't need to be so long. On the positive side, the acting is competent and the photography is moody and gives the story a lightly eerie undercurrent throughout. Though not enough to make the movie actually scary, however.",/review/rw3105555/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2014,george.schmidt,1," Mr MojoRising should come back and haunt the filmmakers
","DELIVER US FROM EVIL (2014) * Eric Bana, Edgar Ramirez, Olivia Munn, Joel McHale, Lulu Wilson, Chris Coy, Dorian Missick, Sean Harris, Mike Houston, Olivia Horton, Scott Johnsen. Yet another 'based on a true story' horror hodgepodge of exorcism and demon possession this time based on a book by Bronx detective Ralph Sarchie (Bana) who encounters inexplicable phenomena while investigating several crimes with the common link of the supernatural and unexplainable links to The Doors (?!?!).yawn. The barely registrable screenplay adaptation by Paul Harris Boardman and director Scott Derickson pulls out all the tropes including rainy sequences, cats hissing in the dark, etc. that you can see the end results a mile away.

28 March 2015,trashgang,7," Eerie
","This was a rare flick to watch, I mean, it wasn't bad at all but it's the story that isn't what you thought it was going to be. By reading the title you do know that it's all about possession but it isn't the normal way of possession. It started like so many flicks and looked a bit of it was going to be a documentary like we have seen so many luckily it didn't.",/review/rw3105555/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2014,sinnerofcinema,5," Not bad, but could have been better - very formulaic delivery of an already done ""Exorcist""
","Another by the numbers and very formulaic horror scare ripped off directly from the book of ""The Exorcist"". You will feel a keen sense of Déjàvu. The fun in this film is anticipating prior to things happening. And for the most part, if not all the time, you will succeed.",/review/rw3105555/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2015,Screen_Blitz,6," It has its scary moments
","From Scott Dickerson, the director of the 2012 horror-thriller Sinister, Deliver Us From Evil follows a true life story of Ralph Sarchie (played by Eric Bana), a New York detective who investigates a series of murder cases. Before too long, he learns that these murders are tied to demonic possessions and gets help from Mendoza (played by Edgar Ramirez), an educated priest and exorcism expert to stop on the possessions from terrorizing the city. This film is not as scary and eerie as the trailers made it out to be, but it has its moments of scariness. However, compared to Sinister, this film really could have done better.",/review/rw3105555/?ref_=tt_urv

13 May 2018,nogodnomasters,8," Is everybody in?
","If you haven't guessed it, this is another exorcism film...which is real, but isn't. The film starts out as a a number of different tales. A group of soldiers go into an Afghan (?) tunnel only to find... We then switch to Special police officer Ralph Sarchie (Eric Bana) who uses his radar to select certain cases. He gets involved in a domestic dispute, then an odd scene at the Bronx zoo, only be followed by a family who claims their house is haunted. As he gathers evidence, everything ties to together leading of course to the expected climax with Father Mendoza (Édgar Ramírez) named for the Mendoza line.",/review/rw3105555/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2014,Scarecrow-88,5," Deliver Us from Evil
","Nicely photographed but derivative demon possession NYPD action horror film, directed by Scott Derrickson (Sinister; Hellraiser: Inferno; The Exorcism of Emily Rose) starring Eric Bana as an agnostic Catholic cop facing sinister dangers as a trio of Iraq combat veterans return to NYC with something spiritually evil that has overtaken them. Partnered with a comedic, thrill-seeking cop, Jimmy (Chris Coy), and a young priest with his own personal demons, Mendoza (Édgar Ramírez), Bana's Sarchie will try to find and stop the volatile, unstable demon-possessed soldiers (who have taken to beating their wives). In one case, the demon possession spread to the wife who is found rabid in a zoo, while a soldier (painter as a civilian) walks freely among lions which allows him to escape. The police procedural leads to creepy Satanic ritualism, monstrous men taken over by evil and seemingly absent their humanity, and scribbling in an unusual language found where the soldiers were located back in the Big Apple. Lots of imagery certain to leave you a bit taken aback (like the body of a decomposed corpse which fell out of a wall, locations rendered dilapidated by the soldiers, etc), and the sight of a child found dead in an alley, ""Deliver Us from Evil"" certainly knows how to get under the skin. However, the ending will more than likely take you right back to the recent demon possession Anthony Hopkins vehicle, The Rite, where a young priest with a less-than-stable spiritual resolve faces the demanding task of removing a demon from a soldier held prisoner as another in the room watches as ""support"". The demon's name being requested and the usual exorcism tactics are here and accounted for. The bells and whistles of demon possession special effects show up, with the only real unique feature this time around being the location of the exorcism located in an interrogation room at a police station. It is forgettable and nothing about the plot is all that original (even Bana's wife and daughter are kidnapped). You could skip this and not miss much. For demon-possession/exorcism movie completists, mostly. Derrickson, though, knows how to evoke mood and darkness especially well. Bana's a fine actor so he makes the role of a cop dealing with the traumas of a typical life working the streets of NYC his own, which is no surprise. Coy's a hoot as Bana's wise-cracking partner, eventually going out as funny cop partners typically do in these types of movies.",/review/rw3105555/?ref_=tt_urv
