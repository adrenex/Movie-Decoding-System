22 January 2014,doofuspoofus,6," You've already seen the funny parts
",I love Kevin Hart don't get me wrong. His stand up is hilarious and I also love Ice Cube's movies AND the two of them have great chemistry on screen and all but....it wasn't that funny. This movie had its' funny parts but the problem is most of them you already saw on the preview. This won't go on my list of funniest movies I've ever seen but it had decent action and decent humor. It had a little twist toward the end but thinking of the premise movies like Meet the Parents were funnier or Twenty one jump street or The Heat but what can I say it was filmed well and the two of them together provided enough entertainment so the film is worth a watch.,/review/rw3096697/?ref_=tt_urv

",Ride Along with Kevin Hart and Ice Cube isn't reinventing the game but Hart is hilarious and worth the watch.,/review/rw3096697/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2014,bravesfanc,6," It's what you expect
",We've all seen this type of movie before. It's a buddy cop flick where the 2 guys don't see eye to eye in the beginning but by the end they learn to appreciate one another. The only difference with this one is that Kevin Hart is trying to get approval from Ice Cube to marry his sister.,/review/rw3096697/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2020,MAYESY-44,7," Good fun
",Good fun film with some good action and a decent story which was pretty original. The partnership between Ice cube and Kevin hart was also great.,/review/rw3096697/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2014,torstensonjohn,7," Fun buddy comedy
","When you think of Ice Cube you think of the hardcore rapper from NWA, the gangster persona, not complex actor. Yet since becoming an actor Ice Cube; real name (O'Shea Jackson), has developed himself into quite the character actor. The comedic prescence of Kevin Hart and this budding police comedy brings the movie full tilt. There is a great story line that suggests looking for comfort and approval betweent Hart's character and Cube's. There are hilarious comments throughout the film and the writing was quite original. This is a great movie with strength in the plot, the characters and just fun throughout. There is no doubt I would highly recommend this to everyone. Kevin Hart is becoming the fast uprising comedic actor of late.",/review/rw3096697/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2022,UniqueParticle,9," I'm one of very few that loves Ride Along
","I re watched the other day and always entertained by everything. It's a shame more don't appreciate the movie I even saw in the theater originally just wasn't reviewing back then. I love the comedy, ridiculous behavior and how fun everything is maybe a guilty pleasure for my but I really like Tim Stories films!",/review/rw3096697/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2014,bobsgrock,," Ice-Cold Movie, Warm Hart.
","No matter how popular this film becomes at the box office, Kevin Hart no longer has to prove himself as being worthy of a lead star. His comedic timing and graceful style more than prove that in Ride Along. The trouble is that the film itself is so lacking in almost any originality or intelligence that he would have had to do a lot in order to show himself worse than the movie.",/review/rw3096697/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2014,didonatope,6," A Not Great, but Enjoyable Ride
","Fresh off of his hit stand-up comedy film, ""Let Me Explain,"" Kevin Hart returns to the big screen with ""Ride Along."" While it may be far from the most memorable comedy, I can't help but admit I enjoyed sitting through it. ",/review/rw3096697/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2014,xylofonfisk,3," Tiring ride
","I Really wanted to like this movie. I usually enjoy Kevin Hart and Ice Cube I have followed since the Friday movies. But even the last Friday movie was more fun than this. The problem is it has all been seen so many times before and better! the characters are more caricatures than characters. The jokes you know long before they actually happen. Ice Cube is being more ""badass"" than in XXX 2, which only makes him appear more moronic. But my biggest problem with the movie is Kevin Hart. That guy can be sooo hilarious! this movie is the ONLY movie where I did not find him funny at all, and at the end were only annoyed by him. A real shame......",/review/rw3096697/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2014,bkoganbing,5," You're not good enough for my sister
",I see that while Ride Along is still in theaters in a first run we've already got in place a planned sequel with the highly original title of Ride Along 2. Ever since The Godfather no one has ever bothered to come up with original titles for movie sequels. No reason to expect originality from the folks who produced Ride Along.,/review/rw3096697/?ref_=tt_urv

19 April 2014,larrys3,3," Rather Lame & Ridiculous Comedy

17 September 2014,kosmasp,5," Fun Ride
","Ice Cube seems to be playing the brother or father, who tries to ""protect"" one other family member from making a bad choice. There's another movie out this year (2014), if you watch that, you'll know what I mean. The other movie is also way funnier. But back to this one, which checks all the right boxes, with a weird beginning, that makes it look like a different sort of beast than it actually is.",/review/rw3096697/?ref_=tt_urv

20 May 2014,westsideschl,1," Sad, Not Funny
","The writer's need to get out of Hollywood and get a real life. Beginning scene of black high school athlete following some loser white dude into something dumb is about as likely as flying pigs. Opening scenes with car chases weaving through pedestrian traffic with 180 degree spins accompanied with guns-a-blazing & leaping acrobatics is so tiresomely old that a good nap was in order during it all. Made worse by being overly fakey. Then add an even more tiresome clich√© of a run in with stereotyped bikers. A lot of Tyler Perry style black face ""lack of humor"" that does more harm than help in destroying stereotypes. Usual Eastern European bad guys selling stuff from a dockside warehouse (where it all eventually ends in shootout - of course). Predictable cop and wannabe cop get it together.

29 December 2014,WadeBLURAYTHEWAY,8," A great laugh
",I will first state that I watched this movie without seeing any previews so I was watching the movie fresh and not seeing any key scenes which may have been shown in the trailers. ,/review/rw3096697/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2018,fallyhag,4," Lazy writing with mildly amusing cliches
",There are some good actors in this film. But it was all following such a lazy storyline. Painfully bad. At some points they must have got so bored because they couldn't even be bothered to try and make it believable. The climax in the warehouse was an appalling example of direction. It dragged on and stalled half way through. Then they realised so just added a very poor shootout scene. It was just so lazy.,/review/rw3096697/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2014,Amari-Sali,7," This pseudo-buddy cop film starts off the year of Kevin Hart overload on a good note.
","In the first of three films in which Kevin Hart is starring in this year, February will have About Last Night and then in the summer we'll have Think Like a Man 2, we have Kevin and Ice Cube combining talents. And for those who like Hart's comedy act persona, meaning him acting tough until things get serious and then he starts screaming like a child, this maybe the movie for you.

20 March 2014,The_moan_of_all_moans,2," Horrible.
","I entered CineWorld through the revolving doors and I wish I just had the sense, within those seconds, to complete a 360 degree rotation and exit again. Yes, it would have been pointless and a short waste of time; and if eyes where on me I may have come across rather strange, but if I had a time machine I would have wasted those 3 seconds whilst appearing unstable if it meant I could have avoided this film.",/review/rw3096697/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2014,TheBrianator88,6," It was funny
","OK first off, let me ask you people where the hell you guys got this 1 star rating for this movie. Seriously? WTF?? Did you guys even actually go and see the movie or did you take a guess by watching the trailer? 1 star? Really! Well I'm just gonna point out, in my opinion, honestly, because I saw it and all. It was good and funny nonstop. I'd give it 7/10 stars. Kevin Hart and Ice Cube are both legends, and they got together and made a movie that was funny and action packed. Think of them as Shrek and Donkey, Ice Cube being Shrek, quiet and serious, and Kevjn Hart, who is talkative and slightly annoying, in a good way. That's what it reminded me of. The movie was worth my $12.00 I spend last night and Im glad I saw it. So I hope this review helps for those who haven't seen it yet and you can forget about that 1 star rating thing.",/review/rw3096697/?ref_=tt_urv
