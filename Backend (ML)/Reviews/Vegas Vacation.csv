31 December 1999,frank56,," An overlooked, intelligently produced and directed film.
","I applaud John Singleton for being brave enough to film ""Poetic Justice"" -- it's a real triumph in presenting a story that looks beyond Hollywood's usual stereotypes of urban youth.  If you are looking for a typical gang-bangin' shoot em up angry urban film...look elsewhere, because that genre is miles away from Singleton's storytelling.  This film has precisely what black audiences say they are looking for - depth, real characters with a number of real layers....and yet people say they cannot get into this film.  I say watch it and simply feel the messages being conveyed through the hearts of the characters.  Tupac Shakur's performance saddens my heart....because he had so much potential as an actor as proven with his performance here.  I was fortunate enough to actually meet and compliment him on this performance, which is at turns skillful and all his own.  He had that quality that film actors envy in that the camera loved him. Janet Jackson gives a skilled performance as well, and the two have a natural chemistry that works here.  This film is worth watching...it's one of my favorites.",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2011,StevePulaski,8," Justice for all
","After making the effective tear-jerker Boyz N The Hood, John Singleton returns to the field of film with Poetic Justice. While this one is significantly different from that masterpiece, it still has its perks and a solid message to add to its formula of an urban-drama. It is the second film in what Singleton has branded his ""Hood trilogy,"" but yet, it is definitely the weakest of them all.",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2019,lee_eisenberg,8," Tupac Shakur's all too brief career
","John Singleton's ""Poetic Justice"" might be of interest nowadays for the presence of Tupac Shakur, who was shot dead three years after the release. But more than that, it's a soft, positive look at relationships in South Central. Janet Jackson plays the title character, who accompanies some friends to Oakland. While the movie does have some intense scenes, the poetry narration - hence the title - moves everything along.",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 1999,macnjnc,," A John Singleton movie that's a lot better than reviews would suggest.
","Poetic Justice is the type of film that will sneak up on you. Some parts of the movie are a little slow, but as a whole the movie is very good. Director Singleton is able to bring a certain mood to this film; wavering between dark, funny and compassionate. Justice (Janet Jackson) is a directionless and lost female who expresses her wants and sorrows through poetry. Because of deaths in her family she is alone.",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2004,whoTheFuqRyou,," not bad at all...
","Poetic Justice is an urban film but within this catgory it stands out from alot of them in its own way.  The movie uses some very interesting elements that I was familiar with and like most urban films they use realistic characters.  The camerawork is nothing new but some of it is really good to look at.  Janet Jackson is good as the somewhat uptight poet/hairdresser who is mourning the loss of her lover while on a night out with him as is Tupac in a rather different role from the ones he has in Juice, Bullet and Above The Rim.  Not only is the role different but as a man it's impossible to not relate to him as you see his struggles in his life including one powerful scene in which he catches his baby's mother smokin' crack and having other men in his daughter's presence - I thought this worked great because I know how I'd feel if I had a kid and my baby's mother is bringing other men around my kid: I wouldn't be too happy.  The road trip is where you begin to see all the characters(Pac Shakur, Janet Jackson, Regina King and Joe Torry) develop and John Singleton wastes little time doing that during that time...",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2001,DunnDeeDaGreat,10," A good street romance
","Poetic Justice is a great movie. It's not the follow up that wasn't as strong as it should have been for someone of Singelton calibar but it's still a good movie. Jackson and Shakur made their mark in this movie and keeps your attention. Check this out with Sineglton's other films in the ghetto trilogy, Boyz N The Hood &Baby Boy.",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2014,vchimpanzee,," Not my taste but worth seeing
","I am a white man over the age of 50, so this film wasn't really made for me. That doesn't mean there wasn't anything here, and I could see that this was a quality production.",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2005,josh-hall,," One of the truly excellent films of the 1990's!
","I saw this film after becoming addicted to 'Boyz n the hood'and 'Higher learning', I think John Singleton is one of the greatest filmmakers working today and Poetic Justice is a great example of a truly dedicated and talented filmmaker. The story starts off with Justice (played brilliantly by Janet Jackson, what a surprise)who witnesses the slaying of her boyfriend at a movie, justice becomes very depressed with life and feels nothing but loneliness. She expresses this by writing poems in a notebook to reveal her pain for her lost love and for the pain of living in America's South central l.a district. Lucky (again played greatly by Tupac Shakur in i feel his most personal and greatest role from 'Juice' right up to 'Gang Related')is a postman with nothing to look forward for in his life except to look after his daughter and a dream of rapping his pain for the hood. Together they go on a road trip with two other friends and learn on how to live again and to find their way in life. The performances are great, Singletons direction is wonderful. If your a fan of other 'hood' movies than this you might find a little different from the others. But nonetheless a deep hearted gem. 9/10",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2011,tmanbball,8," good flick!
","the only reason i don't rate this film higher is because i always thought it was a tad long. john singleton, i love your work! like spike lee ( with a lot of his films) and ice cube (with 'friday' and 'barbershop') you've caught a time and place that's only clear to those that have lived it, or at least have knowledge of its existence. all of you capture black young'uns (east and west coasts) as they were lived during the times depicted in the films. wonderful stuff! great acting, solid story, everything is more heartfelt than not, it's why i go to the movies! i hope u and spike and ice cube and tyler perry (silly as he can b!) and the whole slew of other black filmmakers continue for many years to come. i love your work, your honesty and your sincerity. this is good movie-making, maya angelou's poetry is a plus and a bonus!!!",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2002,QDMan5,10," Tupac greatest performance
",This is one of the greatest movies. the greatest romance movie to. Tupac performance is so great. he proves he can do different roles every time he acts. this is probably john singletons 2nd best film next to boys n tha hood of course. Tupac just gives a thug from the streets performance to a romantic performance. the movie is fun to watch especially when tupac and janet get in to arguments.,/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2004,nadia-31,," Worth a look!
","I read the other review and simply had to comment on it. This was a great movie. Perhaps not filled with action. But it takes the poetic point of view and happily surprises you. It's in my DVD - shelf at home. Janet is showing a great acting and so is Tupac. My boyfriend weren't that crazy about it, so I've come to realize that it take a special kind of person to want to see and understand the movie at it's fullest. Since i write poetry in my spare time maybe that explains my passion about this movie. In all, I think you should rent it if the review at the back cover tempt you, it's pretty much what you get.",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2019,eingelas,10," An underrated gem
","I don't know why everyone was so hard on Janet Jackson's acting. Her performance was great. This is a classic film. Gritty, sweet, and hilarious at the same time. RIP to John Singleton. He was a true legend.",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2021,kevin_robbins,10," This is an absolute must see movie and an American cinematic classic
","Poetic Justice (1993) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows a woman whose boyfriend was killed and she's struggling to move on. Her girlfriend invites her to join her and her boyfriend on a weekend trip that includes the boyfriend's best friend. At first the couple get along while the girlfriend and best friend fight like cats and dogs, then it becomes vice versa. A rollercoaster of scenarios and circumstances ensue where they hope to finish their trip without killing each other.",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 1999,cupcake-6,," Not as bad as some think
","Okay, I'll be the first to admit that this is nowhere near as good as Boyz in the Hood, however, it's not as bad as some make it out to be.  The acting is somewhat lacking, but the story as a whole is moving. If you're a diehard Singleton fan, or are just in the mood for a pretty decent movie, go for it, you've got nothing to lose.",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2002,bob the moo,," Good try but scrappy, over use of swearing and a really badly miscast Jackson foil it
","Justice is in love, sadly in Compton things happen and her boyfriend Markell is killed at a drive in.  Since then she has worn black and stayed away from men and just written her poems.  However when she is taken on a road trip by her friend Iesha she finds she has been set up with her boyfriend's friend Lucky.  At first the two don't get on but over the course of the trip the four fight, make up and learn.",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2001,moonspinner55,4," Self-conscious, and so cynical as to be self-damning
","Rarely have I seen a modern movie about romance that was so angry and bitter--and all without purpose. The Maya Angelou poetry seems out-of-place in a story about a beautician's rocky courtship with a troubled postman in South Central L. A., and yet it practically sounds like music next to all the ""F--- you""'s and N-words. Some may argue this constant foul language is ""realistic"", but the majority of the film is unconvincing in its relationships (which are puzzling, to say the least). Janet Jackson has a sweet smile, and looks attractive in her corn-rows and floppy hats, but the mercurial tone of the picture is up and down, back and forth, and finally we just give up on 'Justice' and all her scowling friends. And what about that ratty beginning at the drive-in? *1/2 from ****",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2017,Irishchatter,8," Brilliant with 2pac and Janet Jackson
","Honestly these two were such a cute couple on this but the only problem I had while watching this movie, they added in such annoying characters for this movie. It would've been better if Regina King as Iesha and Joe Torry as Chicago to not join with them for the journey. These characters really did give me the biggest headache that any movie had giving me.",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2021,elicopperman,7," Poetically Wholesome Journey of Self Discovery
","Aspiring poets are not often looked upon in film, but when they are, they tend to be young adults hoping for something more in their lives. In the case of the late John Singleton's Poetic Justice, starring Janet Jackson and Tupac Shukar, it focuses on a young hairdresser who goes on a road trip from South Central Los Angeles to Oakland with her friend and a mail truck driver. Although the film wasn't the movie wasn't the biggest hit with critics back in its original 1993 release, it has garnished enough cultural status to be admired as a romantically enduring drama within the coming of age genre.",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 1999,crisrabb,7," great film... with one small exception
","Poetic justice was a good film, and well acted, with one exception. To me, Janet Jackson simply wasn't convincing in her role. Through no fault of her own. I believe the problem was that she is too big an entertainment personality to be able to play anyone besides herself. It's difficult for the audience to get past the fact that it's ""Janet Jackson"" on the screen and see the character. Similar to when Madonna tried to portray Evita Peron. A strong character, and a good story, but you couldn't help seeing ""Madonna"" every time you look at the screen. I realize big names are intended to boost box office sales, and I respect that too. After all, show business is BUSINESS. Still, I think it would be good if casting directors would hire good actors instead of known celebrities and respect the integrity of the writing, as well as the audience.",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv

","Justice (Janet Jackson) loses her boyfriend when someone shots him right in front of her on a date at the drive-thru. It's the violent world of South Central L.A. She withdraws into her hairdressing job and her poetry. Lucky (Tupac Shakur) is a postal carrier who is sweet on her. His ex is a drug addict whom he has a daughter with. Going to the hair show convention in Oakland, Justice has to ride with Lucky in his mail truck. He's going to his friends to work on his music. They argue. He throws her off his truck.

27 July 2021,momjessicaandjordan,8," Loved It!!
","All in All, Poetic Justice is a realistic hood love drama story. The film also serves as a reminder that you can let your guard down and fall in love with a rapping mailman while still maintaining what makes you yourself. Also one thing I will give John Singleton credit is that he really knew how to bring the acting down to the rappers. Tupac's performance was just as you expected from Tupac just like all of the other iconic movies he was in like Juice and Above the Rim. I mean all of those movies and even in Poetic Justice, he's playing a hood dude so go figure what do you expect lol. All jokes aside his delivery and emotional range really surprised me and I don't mean delivery as in delivering mail packages. It's not the best Tupac performance I've ever seen but it will still do. Also Janet Jackson was great too forgot to mention that. I'll recommend this movie if you like romantic movies or if you have a girlfriend and your in love and want to watch a movie like Poetic Justice, go for it.",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2009,generationofswine,1," Crap.
","Pretentious. Unrealistic. Awful. Crap. I'm actually shocked this came from the writer of ""Boyz in the Hood"" & ""Higher Learning."" I had a hard time figuring out the plot of this one, on the surface level it was evident enough, but no, I thought there had to be more to it...It turns out I was wrong, all there is is the surface level. It doesn't stand as a romantic movie, it doesn't stand as a road trip movie, it doesn't stand as buddie movie. I'm actually depressed that Maya Angelou was in it,but I am comforted in the fact that she doesn't have to make a living as an actress. But it does strike a cord in me. I once dated an artist in university, I spent a lot of time with her and her friends, the film reminded me of them: shallow, pretentious, and totally awful.",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 1999,DIE HARD-4,," Sooooooooooooooooo boring !!
","""Poetic Justice"" is great if you need a good nights sleep. This movie is guaranteed to put you asleep. The only two things about this film that are not worthless, are actors Janet Jackson and Tupac Shakur, who are both actually quite good, not to say great.",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2001,tequieroselena,10," So Easy To Relate To This Film
","Now, honestly, if you werent born and raised in L.A. you probably wouldn't be able to relate to this. However, I was born and raised in L.A., and all of the characters speech, slang, and laid-backness reminds me so much of people I know, including myself. It especially reminds me of being a teenager in high school, and all the boy drama and fights where all we did was swear at each other. It's very easy for me to identify with, and I think as long as you're from Los Angeles, you should be able to relate to this film.",/review/rw0326944/?ref_=tt_urv
