28 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,8," Pretty Good!
",Legends of Tomorrow is one of the more underrated DC shows. It's about a time traveling group of ragtag heroes and former villains that try to prevent events from happening that would change the world we live in. This show knows exactly what it wants to be and that's absolutely bananas. It's a great show to just turn your brain off and escape to have some fun. The cast changes a little though out the seasons but each new character brings something new to the show and continues to make the show feel fresh. It's too bad it ended a season early and in a cliffhanger but it's still definitely worth watching.,/review/rw5433403/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,SpideyVerse23,8," A guilty pleasure show
",Legends of Tomorrow is a very creative and just fun show which I find myself liking despite how ridiculous it can be. What starts out as a superhero show soon becomes less superhero and more character based show. The cast changes almost every season but that works out for the show most of the time.,/review/rw5433403/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2020,Supermanfan-13,8," It's ridiculous but fun!
","Legends of Tomorrow is a wild, weird and just flat out fun show. The best thing about it is it doesn't take itself too serious, it knows what kind of show it is. They make fun of themselves all the time and how ridiculous the show is at times. The cast has changed quite a bit over the years but all of them have fit in and carried their own. I have to admit that I'm a huge superhero fan, not the comics but the movies and tv shows so that's why I gave it a chance to begin with but I'm glad I did because I really do like it.",/review/rw5433403/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,SaintNinja,10," This campy light sci-fi has more depth and multilayered metaphors than so called serious contemporary shows.
","Yes, I mean it, you can read the headline again. I speak only for Season 1, which starts as an average cosmic time travel low budget fun, but gets topical near the second half. While so called serious films and shows keep playing with fake things like elections, laws and government justice, Legends of Tomorrow (season 1) gives us the real picture of the world - everything is rigged, everything is a lie. Of course, it's not as deep as Star Trek (TNG, DS9, Voyager) or StarGate SG-1. Even Andromeda with Kevin Sorbo is more sophisticated, but I was surprised by the twist in the 14-15 episodes of the Legends. As a russian man born in USSR, I always wondered, why so called ""free"" democratic countries finance really bad totalitarian regimes like Putin's Russia or North Korea? Legends of Tomorrow season 1 has quite original answer that I've hardly ever read about or heard before. It's very cute that writers put their serious ideas into simple comedic sci-fi. Nevertheless, Legends of Tomorrow Season 1 is worthy time wasting for all sci-fi collectioners like me.",/review/rw5433403/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2022,southdavid,8," Tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know to soon.
","I've watched most of the Berlanti-verse shows. Of those, though ""Legends of Tomorrow"" seemingly received the littlest fanfare, for me it was one of the better ones.",/review/rw5433403/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2020,rpvtimcotter,9," Evolving is more important than where you start
","Season 1 of Legends of Tomorrow was a mixture of tones and themes that ended with somewhat of a bad taste in the viewer's mouth. It wasn't sure where it wanted to go, it wasn't sure of what it wanted to do. It's ironic that the issues of the first season became a sort of metaphor for the show's characters: evolving beyond where they started to become something better.",/review/rw5433403/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2016,lnvicta,6," Poorly written, visually impressive, superficial entertainment.
","I'm still not sure how I feel about ""Legends of Tomorrow"". I liked Ray more in ""Arrow"" and the thought of these eight random rogues working together is baffling. But the more I watched the more I learned to accept the show for what it is: comic book eye candy. That's really all it is. There's occasional moments of good acting; they're rare but they happen, mainly from Garber and Miller who fit like a glove into their characters Dr. Martin Stein and Leonard Snart (Captain Cold) respectively. None of the acting is offensively bad actually. It's the writing that's the bane of the show. These characters are constantly saying and doing the stupidest possible things in any given situation. It's one thing to suspend disbelief but it helps to have a modicum of common sense to keep us grounded, which many of these characters do not.",/review/rw5433403/?ref_=tt_urv

17 September 2022,mrchrisinpoland,9," Great first three series .... but
","I have watched all the way through from the first episode of the first series, through to the end of the fifth series. The first two series were great, the third gets a little too air fairy and focused on relationships more than adventures, not so bad, however at this point all men become lesser characters and the women take over. Before, there was reasonable balance, and the last two series, the writing skills just lose sight of quality standards, and you can feel sorry for the actors at this point. I read here that there are currently seven series, so I'll wait to see what the new additions are like.",/review/rw5433403/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2019,danhuiner,6," Certain characters bring it down.
",Honestly I've watched Legends since day 1 and I liked it cuz it was different and there was new characters to learn about but with season 3 and 4 they added Gary and Mona. Gary is just a moron to point and laugh at and Mona is just an annoying werewolf. And the werewolf doesn't look believable like at all. I don't like being negative but I couldn't help but share that.,/review/rw5433403/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2019,djeec-1,2," This series has completely jumped the shark.
","Legends of Tomorrow used to just be silly, now it's just ridiculous. Storylines have gotten totally convoluted and make zero sense. The cast no longer feels as bloated as it once was, but now it's like they're throwing in everything but the kitchen sink just to keep making things happen. The show is riddled with gigantic plot holes and completely lazy writing. Like, what the hell is the point to having a time-traveling spaceship, when you have a bureau that can just press a button with a little device and they can just time travel that way? The whole thing seems arbitrary and pointless. And in half the episodes now the heroes never use any of their powers. Aren't they supposed to be superheroes? Episodes just keep making huge jumps in logic and expecting the viewers to just accept it. They don't provide explanations for absolutely anything. It's like the writers know that things have gotten so silly, that they just don't care anymore. Compare it to a series like Doom Patrol. That show is super silly, but at least things make sense on some level, and you know people writing for it truly care. It's like Legends just doesn't give a crap. Performances used to show promise, now they're just cringe-worthy. What happened? I'm a huge DC, sci-fi, and time travel fan, and I really can't stand the show anymore. Whatever corner they've turned, it hasn't been for the better. It's time these Legends ride off into the sunset.",/review/rw5433403/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2017,Monicacorpuz,8," Fun and light-hearted
","People! Give it a break! This show never fails to make me laugh! It's ridiculous, cheesy and a ton of fun. Suspend reality and enjoy the ride- this is not meant for heavy thinking, deep romances or for pondering your role in life. It's fun. The humor is the truly captivating part. You never know where or when it's going to come from, but this show is a hoot- as long as you don't take yourself too seriously. I suggest giving it a try- I think this show has earned it.",/review/rw5433403/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2019,hannonsean,1," Enjoy 1-3 seasons
","Really, in each CW hero show the 1st, 2nd and sometimes 3rd seasons are amazing. Fun, great stories, fun crossovers, awesome characters and villains, action the works. Then..... then it turns into a sad sad little universe. Haha enjoy what you can then feel ok about stop watching the show.",/review/rw5433403/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2017,florin-radu-343-900094,10," Stands out from the crowd
","It is provoking to see how various DC shows are cleverly interweaved. However, trying to do a spin-off from so many of them was something I was originally skeptical about. Perhaps the first season did not give sufficient sense of direction, but the second one totally redeemed the show. I had a tense moment at the season two finale, which looked very much like a cut off point. Luckily, the decision to continue the series is highly praised, it is in my views the funniest DC show ever. I really enjoy each episode with very good laughs. The viewers criticising it for the quality of the plot might not realise that it is presumably the perfect parody that this genre was so desperately missing.",/review/rw5433403/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2016,fredschaefer-406-623204,8," ""We go out for one lousy drink and you guys somehow manage to pick a fight with Boba Fett""
","I had a lot of fears that The CW just might be going to the well once too often with the DC Universe with its LEGENDS OF TOMORROW, a joint spin off of the successful ARROW and THE FLASH series. But judging from the premiere episode, the LEGENDS is off to a good, if not great start, with a lot of interesting characters and a premise that promises enough comic book intrigue and action to more than keep the show going for awhile.

",Although continue to watch this show it gets worst every week. I only watch because I have been since very 1st episode. It was good then. All of their super powers. Now Ray never uses Atom suit.

21 January 2018,highmarksreviews,7," Campy mish-mashed fun
","Legends of Tomorrow never really takes itself seriously. Its main purpose is to rod more successful Arrowverse shows of problem characters. The result is an often poorly written superhero slugfest that actually works. Season 1 struggled with a good villain or narrative but it's evolved and is probably one of the stronger shows come Seasons 2 and 3. The campy dialogue and premises drag it down, but it delivers a healthy, entertaining dosage of comic book characters, stories and moments.",/review/rw5433403/?ref_=tt_urv

","When this series started 5 years ago it was truly ""legendary"" with great heroes putting their unique powers on full display. The crossover episodes were without question spectacular, but it's the last crossover arc which has exposed just how far gone ""Legends"" has deteriorated. Crisis on infinite earths 1 thru 4 were action filled and breathtaking. However, part 5 which ended the arc with the legends went from serious to silly.
