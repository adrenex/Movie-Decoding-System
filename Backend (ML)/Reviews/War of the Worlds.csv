22 December 2018,ahmetkozan,8," Never Show Your Weakness!
","I think the British are usually successful in thriller genre. And I've seen that they are really successful with this series. The series made an excellent beginning with the opening scene. I can say that, the first 20 minutes of Bodyguard are arguably one of the best thriller scenes. From that moment onwards, I knew I had to watch all of episodes as quickly. At some moments the tension was so high that I could feel the excitement.",/review/rw8199555/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2020,Supermanfan-13,9," Edge of your seat thriller!
","Bodyguard is deserving of all the awards nominations it got including all the big award shows like Golden Globes, Emmy's, etc. Richard Madden was so good in this that he won the Golden Globe for best lead actor! Bodyguard is a great action thriller that will grab you from the first episode and keep you on the edge of your seat through to the last episode. It was suppose to be a one season limited series but it got such great reviews and great word of mouth from fans of the show that they are now planning on doing another season which is phenomenal news!",/review/rw8199555/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2018,grantss,9," Excellent series - enthralling, intriguing and action-packed
","After an act of heroism which prevents a terrorist attack on a train, Police Sergeant David Budd is assigned to protect the Home Secretary, Julia Montague. Budd is the consummate professional but finds himself conflicted. He served in Afghanistan and saw many of his comrades killed or maimed in a war which Montague was to a degree responsible for. In addition, he soon finds himself a pawn in a political power struggle. Moreover, terrorist activity is on the rise and he finds himself in the centre of it.",/review/rw8199555/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2018,Herbalicious_690,10," Extremely good show
","Strong acting, well written dialogue, strong acting and direction. The show is strong enough to be either binge watched and hold your interest throughout, or to watch in a series of mini-binges (e.g. two at a time instead of a movie). I am not sure I could leave it a full week between episodes, each episode had me wanting more. The length of the series is short but perfect, not overly drawn out, nor rushed towards the finish line. The cast is well chosen, and they do way more than just deliver their lines, a result that draws you in and keeps you guessing. The directions and mis-directions to keep you guessing do not under-estimate the intelligence of the audience, nor try to spell out every detail so it does require some attention, but is all the better because of this. A very very strong show, and I really hope they can bring a second series to air with a different bent to it, but a second series would be a really big challenge to top or equal this first. I highly recommend this as a must-watch.",/review/rw8199555/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2020,neonblade-2,8," Gripping, but flawed
","The first episode is amazingly good.
Pacing is excellent, great actors, interesting characters.
The flaws?
1) Killing Julia off.
She was such a crucial character that the episodes after her demise were lacking.
2) The final episode.
As other reviewers have said, it was full of plot holes. I'd agree with many of other reviewers statements regarding a talented bomb-maker blowing herself up, and the sudden urge to confess by several characters just didn't ring true.
Still, ignoring those flaws, I really enjoyed this series and hope they make a second series.",/review/rw8199555/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2018,Sleepin_Dragon,10," Seminal drama
","Most drama serials are enjoyable, but pass by like the Summer, they're nice while they lost, but quickly pass by. I think Bodyguard is a drama that will linger for some time. It starts off as it ends, explosive, gripping, unexpected, and full to bursting with twists and intrigue. I can think of only positives, the writing, superb, Jed Mercurio in recent years can do no wrong, he's followed Line of Duty up in some style. The acting is off the scale, Richard Madden in particular delivers huge performance after huge performance, quite incredible, Keeley Hawes, Gina McKee and Paul Ready are fantastic throughout. I love how it's full of twists and turns, over the span of the series I imagined numerous outcomes, I felt sure I'd thought of everything, obviously not, I can't believe what he pulled off. There are so many highlights in the Series, I think I perhaps found the opener the most powerful, truly heart in the mouth viewing.",/review/rw8199555/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2019,deloudelouvain,7," Disappointing ending but for the rest a good show.
","What could have been an excellent show ended up just being a good show. I have to agree with some reviewers on here, the show started promising with quite a bit of suspense and intrigues but the final episode was a bit of a letdown to me and I'm obviously not the only one thinking like that. It clearly could have done with a better ending. But apart from that this series is enjoyable to watch, with good actors, and plenty enough of action and suspense. Once you start watching it you want to know what will happen next, that's a good enough indicator for me for a good show.",/review/rw8199555/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2022,kosmasp,9," Protecting (and serving)
","No pun intended - someone who has seen war ... well not everyone can handle the stuff that went on there. And let me say from the start, there may be some things story wise (and character wise) that would not pass a smell test as they say. Or would easily crumble under scrutiny. Some things are not build upon concrete things and a solid base.",/review/rw8199555/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2018,philneil,8," I now have an ulcer.
","Fantastic opening episode. I can't believe some have rated this lower than a 5.
My stomach was in knots, especially for the first 20 minutes.
The best way I can describe it is that it has the holding one's breath suspense of 'The Night Manager' mixed with an uneasy, on-edge feel of 'Spooks'.",/review/rw8199555/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2020,cjonesas,9," [9.4] Superior on all accounts
","When you start watching a series and it grabs your attention since its early minutes, intensity and nail-biting thrill reaching a powerful crescendo in its first twenty minutes, you can be pretty sure that you have a valuable gem before your eyes and Bodyguard doesn't disappoint a bit in that and continuously keeps viewers' expectations high with quality after quality.",/review/rw8199555/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2020,JigarPatel11,10," You won't take a break till you finish it
","One of the best thriller series I have watched lately. It grips you right from the first 20 minutes till the end.
Lots of twists and turns and no matter how much you try to calculate what is going to happen next, the show shocks you each time.",/review/rw8199555/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2022,ricovegas,8," Suspenseful even though a bit too formulaic
","There's quite a bit (especially the last episode) that stops this mini-series from being one of the best I have ever seen.. Having said that, it is one compelling ride loaded with suspense and plot twists.",/review/rw8199555/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2022,liamshirazi,9," A high suspense political thriller
",Bodyguard is netflix most satisfying political thriller shows on the platform. With its high performance by Richard Madden and deep tight shootouts and problems filled with secrets and undercover work makes it must watch. Though being a limited series it should have gotten a 2nd season.,/review/rw8199555/?ref_=tt_urv

23 September 2018,tablemountain1912,6," Good show ruined by really bad last episode
","Very disappointing ending which ruined the whole show for me. The last episode was disappointing for these reasons: 
How does Budd manage to run away from the crack police services after he disarms the bomb?
Why does everyone suddenly have the need to confess and give up the conspiracy?
Why does the crime kingpin not disappear after he sees Budd prancing around with a suicide vest all day - surely he must've reckoned that Budd would tell the police of his involvement. 
How did Budd get into the ex assistant's flat and how does her crime kingpin boyfriend not notice that he's being followed by her car?
Why does the crime kingpin go to his police source's home to confront her at the front of her house?
Why did Nadia reveal all at the end - she would've probably been released if she would've kept stumm but she brags about being a jihadi engineer who saw an opportunity with Budd when he talked her down from blowing up the train. Somehow she deduced that he could be used to create greater havoc (like killing the home secretary) even though she had no influence over his assignment or anything else.

2 December 2018,charlesbrian-03440,8," Starts as Whitney ends as Alexandra Burke
",The first half of the series was some of the best television you will ever see. The initial train scene was about as tense as you can get. Then we have the attempted school bombing and the he attempt on Julia's life. Probably some of the strongest scenes you will ever see. Then the mid series shock the bombing. It pulls the rug from under us. The third episode understandably picks up the pieces and sets the scene.,/review/rw8199555/?ref_=tt_urv

23 November 2018,Victorydays,6," Grips you in the beginning, then it lets you down.

26 November 2018,nancyldraper,10," Beware: once you start watching this, you won't want to step away
","Don't start watching this unless you have the time to finish the all six episodes, because once you begin you won't want to quit. Compelling story. Fabulous acting (Keeley Hawes is at her best in this role and Richard Madden gives a brilliantly multilayered, accessible performance). A great political drama. I think this might be one of the best Limited Edition TV Series of the 2018. (It's available on Netflix) {Political Drama}",/review/rw8199555/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2022,nyfree,10," A Truly Gripping Binge
","I don't usually get roped into political thrillers but this one had me hooked and searching when/if there will be another season. It's not all politics but the bit there is may seem familiar. It is a political/action/mystery/drama thriller with a dash of romance sprinkled on before they capped it with the kitchen sink. Richard Madden (who knocked it out of the park) called the writer ""a genius"" and I can see why. It was notable to me how genuine the characters were written, they behaved like humans do which is satisfying to watch (especially between Budd and Home Secretary Montague). Each episode had great thrills and twists that made six episodes too short for me, but it was a great ride. It is a story with enjoyable characters you can identify who are faced with edge-of-your-seat problematic mysteries that are resolved in brilliant ways in a story that runs deep. Loved it and hope there's a season 2 of equal quality and a higher episode count. It's one of those things you watch that afterwards it still affects you, so I drove my wife to work feeling like her bad@$$ PPO ready for anything.",/review/rw8199555/?ref_=tt_urv
