23 September 2018,golfne1,9," I love this movie
","This, in my opinion, is a fantastic movie. The actors and actresses are phenomenal. I do love that they added Mel Gibson, who plays the perfect ""dad"" to Mark Wahlberg. Will Ferrell and John Lithgow are a true match for a ""father/son"" combo. ",/review/rw3856487/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," Not as funny as the first one, but the additional all star cast and Christmas timing upped it a few notches.
","The critics sure slammed this one. Sure, it's not as funny as the first one, and way too sappy, but the additional all star cast and Christmas timing upped it a few notches. Still an entertaining and fun flick. 8/10 from me",/review/rw3856487/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2018,deloudelouvain,7," If you don't like Will Ferrell just don't watch this movie and stop whining about it
","Why the haters would even start watching this movie is a mystery to me. If you don't like Will Ferrell then just don't watch this movie because it is the same humor as in all the other movies he's been in. I love Will Ferrell and his stupid humor with his nerdy face, so to me this is a good movie. I thought it was even better then the first one. This time John Lidgow is also in the cast and that's another comedian that makes me laugh all the time. They couldn't have found a better guy to play the father of Will Ferrell. Mel Gibson as the father of Mark Whalberg was also a good match. The story might be a bit dorky but I didn't expect anything else. It's all about the silly humor, and if you're not into that, just skip this movie instead of wasting your time twice by watching it and writing a bad review about it. If you do love that kind of humor I'm sure you will have a couple of good laughs.",/review/rw3856487/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2019,patriciogl10,8," A Christmas classic for me.
","Daddy's Home laid the foundations, Daddy's Home 2 further rose them into a stupendous construction that intelligently added more ingredients carefully thought out. It's almost as if the casting director, writers and filmmakers knew exactly what Daddy's Home needed in order to make a better sequel, even with the perfect amount of elements needed, nothing more, nothing less. Of course these elements which I'm referring to are the always warming and family-friendly holiday setting and the obviously salient, hugely welcomed inclusions of two tremendous actors like Mel Gibson and John Lithgow, two polar opposites as already shown with Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell. It is truly impressive how well the casting turned out with them, they played their parts perfectly, you can truly see ""like father, like son"" written all over their characters.",/review/rw3856487/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2020,ethanbresnett,7," A rare comedy sequel that is funnier than the first one!

28 December 2018,cricketbat,2," Everything feels forced and nothing is funny
","Everything in Daddy's Home 2 is forced. The jokes are uninspired, the characters' actions don't make sense and the story becomes more contrived as the movie goes on-the ending is particularly eye-roll inducing. The original film wasn't that good to begin with, but it's better than this half-baked attempt at a Christmas movie.",/review/rw3856487/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2017,idospasjody,9," Great Comedy
","This is much better than the first one. I'm 50 and my daughter is 19 and we laughed all the way thru it. The first one is a little to sappy for me, but the second one is pure comedy. It's just fun. The 4 male stars have the best chemistry and deliver lines with such timing it's refreshing. Have fun",/review/rw3856487/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2018,jtindahouse,7," About what was expected
","Early on in the production of 'Daddy's Home 2' there were rumours flying around that this one would start off where the first one finished with John Cena being the main antagonist of the film, and I thought surely they wouldn't go down that route. John Cena has the charisma of a wet sandbag. Plus it would take away from the main selling point these films have which is the chemistry between Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell. While he does play a larger part in this film than in the first, he is far from a lead actor in it luckily. They made a wise choice on that front.",/review/rw3856487/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2018,Mcduff3601,8," Wayyyy funnier than expected and better than the first
",I was totally entertained by this movie. It had me laughing through most of it. Don't get me wrong it's nothing you haven't seen before but lately I have been sitting through some pretty boring comedies and this one had me Loling out loud!!11one.,/review/rw3856487/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2017,bob-the-movie-man,6," Some good comedy moments drowned in schmaltz.
","Comedy and tragedy have always gone together hand-in-hand. Every great comedy tends to have its bitter-sweet moments: Roberts Blossom as the ""shovel-killer"" grandad in ""Home Alone"" (who always reminds me of my late Dad... in appearance I might add, not that he was a shovel killer!); John Candy's depressed shower-ring salesman in ""Planes Trains and Automobiles""; Ron Burgundy bawling in a phone box in ""Anchorman"". The balance between the two is the key thing and comedies can sometimes get it wrong (the Bird Woman in ""Home Alone 2"" for example!).",/review/rw3856487/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2017,rightisright,8," Better than the first.
","I laughed, I cried. You really kinda had to have the first one to follow this one right away though. I don't want to spoil the funniest scenes or the moving ones so I'll be short. Will Ferrell is on top of his game, hammy yet funny and real at the same time. The real star of the movie is an old pro working it harder than anyone, and that's John Lithgow. And John Cena has developed his comedy chops very well. And you'll never listen to a certain Christmas song the same way again.",/review/rw3856487/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2019,michaeltrivedi,7," Better Than First?
","I really enjoyed this sequel. I thought the extra cast members were really a good addition, like John Cena and Mel Gibson. It was a great family movie, and very cheerful. Will Ferrell has lots of funny scenes. It almost reminded me of Grown Ups, but a little better.",/review/rw3856487/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2019,p-dinning,10," Great Christmas Movie
","A very funny and welcome new Christmas Movie. I really didn't enjoy Daddy's Home 1, and only watched 2 because family wanted to watch it. This was much better...less annoying and much funnier.",/review/rw3856487/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2017,cruise01,3," Almost the same as the first with grandfathers and less laughs and less fun.
","Daddy's Home 2 had the potential of being comedic and fun like how the first film was. But like most comedy sequels, this one was a dud with most of the laughs already shown in the trailers. While the rest of the 90 or so minutes being completely a drag and boring. The first film was a lot of fun with the concept of step dad vs. dad with Will Ferrell vs. Mark Wahlberg. They do make a perfect comedic duo. Daddy's Home 2 tries for the cheap laughs and gags but it's less than the first, and the newcomers were a fun addition like Mel Gibson and John Lithgow. But there talent was not enough to save this film. Not even Mark Wahlberg, and Will Ferrell chemistry was good enough to make it worth watching. ",/review/rw3856487/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2017,Pjtaylor-96-138044,3," Generally inoffensive, but still worse than I could have possibly imagined.
","I'll preface this by saying that I haven't seen, nor now have any interest in ever seeing, the first film in this odd and unnecessary choice for a franchise, so the fairly complicated family dynamics on display were somewhat lost on me for a fair while until I'd worked out exactly who was who's daddy, something not quite as easy as you'd think considering that there are seemingly more 'steps' in this family than in the Burj Khalifa itself, but once I'd found my footing - or, rather, simply found out it both didn't really matter and I didn't care enough anymore to worry about it - I could finally sit back and simply not enjoy the debacle that ensued. Between trying to convince us that Mel Gibson is quote 'beautiful', a certain heroic pilot isn't beyond the cameo he curiously makes and generally that every single actor involved isn't much better than this - to the point where they can't have been happy with the work they were producing (unless something went really wrong in the edit), the flimsy flick represents a series of seriously misjudged skits simply screaming ""we're trying too hard"" while only producing a single 'meh' emoji's worth of a reaction which all amount to an emotional payoff that's technically sound but seriously undercut by its mysteriously musical management and callously cheesy crescendo - an issue actually present throughout the consistently grating and ham-fisted piece. It may be generally inoffensive, but its still actually much worse than I could have possibly imagined. 3/10",/review/rw3856487/?ref_=tt_urv

15 November 2017,fletcherc21,6," Cheap Gags, but Enjoyable None the Less
","Daddy's Home 2 is very similar to its predecessor. If you liked the first one, you'll probably like the second. There are a ton of cheap gags and Will Ferrell gets in situations that should have left him hospitalized constantly. The introduction of Mel Gibson and John Lithgow as the grandfathers just takes the opposite dads concept to the extreme as they are even farther out versions of the Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell characters. Most of the jokes weren't worth more than a chuckle, with the exception of an extremely relatable thermostat bit. The ending was stretching the limits of believably, even for a ridiculous comedy, but all in all it was solid ideal entertainment.",/review/rw3856487/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2021,r96sk,7," It needed more, but it's nothing notably worse than its predecessor which is always a positive for a sequel
","Like the first film, 'Daddy's Home 2' is nothing special but isn't bad either. A fine watch, nothing more or less.",/review/rw3856487/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2018,catfarmer1358,10," Better Than The First One!
","Perhaps I'm in the minority, but I strongly believe that this movie was better than the first in the series. It could be because this was strongly a Christmas film and Christmas films are often my favorite films to watch. It also has a great cast with the addition of the awesome Shakespearean John Lithgow and ""bad boy"" Mel Gibson. I imagine this movie is the closest thing to an ""Elf"" sequel that we will ever get. In fact, if Buddy the Elf left his family in New York, changed his name to brad and married the new wife, then this would be the story. ",/review/rw3856487/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2020,dar0417,5," Better then the 1st one

12 November 2017,bmonsoon,9," Ignore the Haters ;)
","100% chance of this movie being silly and ridiculous, so why go if you expect anything else? I was pleasantly surprised because Daddy's Home Two was much better than the first one. I laughed so hard I cried through the whole thing & the rest of the audience was laughing right along. The chemistry between the characters is great, and the one liners are hilarious. I plan to watch this every Christmas.",/review/rw3856487/?ref_=tt_urv
