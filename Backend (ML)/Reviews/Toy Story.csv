4 April 2022,CubsandCulture,10," The Best Film of 2006-it has aged extremely well.
",I am still shocked that this film wasn't nominated for direction at the Oscars and that it lost best picture to the overwrought The Departed. This is film captures far more of life as lived in single scenes than most films capture in their entire runtime. It is not just the great script that has great comedic bits and utterly real characters. It's not just the pitch perfect cast. This is a great *visual* film as well because of the traveling scenes and the quirky design sense.,/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2006,cchase,9," One Of The Best Movie ""Gifts"" I've Gotten This Year...
","It is very rare to see a movie that can charm the hell out of an audience without the use of special effects, worn-out clichés and bombastic action set pieces these days. It's even more ridiculous to hope that you will see such a film for FREE. But that's exactly what happened to me tonight at a sneak preview of LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE.",/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2006,aharmas,9," More than a fresh ray of sunshine!
","Here is a film that lives up to the expectations of a very funny trailer. It's an oddball comedy, and it's dark, and it's funny, and it's touching, and it will charm the pants off many in the audience. Here is a simple story in which our lovely contestant and her family try to find their way to California so that she can prove to the world she is not a loser! The premise itself can lead to years of therapy for a family that should get a group rate in psychiatric care.",/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2021,Ruskington,8," Anything that makes fun of beauty pageants is alright by me
","A quirky original comedy that works it's way towards a genuinely brilliant finale. Strong cast, sharp humour and good pacing contribute to a modern classic.",/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2013,SnoopyStyle,8," Love these characters
","Sheryl Hoover (Toni Collette) is trying hold this crazy family together. Her brother Frank Ginsberg (Steve Carell) is just released after his suicide attempt. Her husband Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a bad motivational speaker who is always talking about winning except he's a loser himself. Her son Dwayne (Paul Dano) is tired of his family, and has vow to be silent. Grandpa Hoover (Alan Arkin) was kicked out of his nursing home for misbehaving. Finally daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) is so excited about getting into the Little Miss Sunshine pageant.",/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2006,Monotreme02,8," delivers in the most charmingly sweet, pure, honest, and innocent way
","It would be unfair to limit the film to one adjective. But charming is the first one that comes to mind. I really don't know how they did it, but the screenwriter Michael Arndt and directing team Dayton/Faris (Jonathan and Valerie, that is) have managed to create a movie in which we are simply so connected to the characters it's frightening. This is a very quirky bunch, and while their traits can be found in everyone we know, they are certainly extremely weird and I certainly don't know any families who are quite as odd as the Hoovers. And yet, we forge such a strong bond with each and every one of them, right from the opening pre-title introduction sequence  probably the best character introduction sequence I've seen since Magnolia. These people are just so real! It's unbelievable just how three-dimensional these characters are. They remind me of The Squid and the Whale  another recent movie that comes to mind when I think of this type of character development  these are just normal, regular people, and the filmmakers developed them as such in the most in-depth, well thought-out and just ingenious way possible.",/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2012,Hitchcoc,9," Plenty of Nuts in This Tree
","This is such an offbeat piece of work I don't know where to start. I think the Miss Sunshine part tells us that no matter what a mess life may seem, there is a ray of sunshine. This is a story about a group of the most diverse and often dysfunctional characters ever put on a screen. The point of the story is to get to a beauty/talent pageant across country. The positive energy put forth by little Abigail Breslin is astonishing. We know from the start that the little waif with her big glasses isn't going to outshine all those little beauty queens with their overbearing mothers and thousands of dollars for dental work and hair styling. But the movie is about the journey and the love that develops along the way. When push comes to shove it is the ""weird"" who seem the most normal and the Normal who seem ""weird."" Alan Arkin is great in his brief appearance. The profane munching that goes on among the characters is precious. Underlying their schizophrenic rants is true love.",/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2006,imaginarytruths,8," a scathing black comedy that is also emotionally resonant, pro-family, and joy-inducing
","I hate to admit it, but my primary interest in showing up for the screening was to see Steve Carell try his hand at a semi-serious role as the suicidal gay literature professor.",/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2006,jaredmobarak,9," A little sweet sweetnessLittle Miss Sunshine
","Keeping up with the recent buzz-worthy films coming out of Sundance the past couple years, Little Miss Sunshine is a gem of a movie. After loving crowd favorites Primer (2004) and Hustle and Flow (2005), I wasn't quite sure if the hat trick would be made. Sunshine seemed to have the cast, and direction (the debut of husband/wife team Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton, who have helmed some of my favorite music videos including the Smashing Pumpkins' Tonight, Tonight and the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Otherside), but the big question would be if it had the laughs to sustain the quirky indie comedy from not being overwrought and boring. While the film definitely has a couple moments where I was about to be lost, everything ends up happening for a reason; emotions are on a roller coaster ride and the lows always come out with meaning and momentum for the highs. Do yourself a favor and see this sweet, subtle at times and gut-bustingly hilarious at others, perfectly pitched ensemble piece.",/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2006,MatthewInSydney,9," A highly enjoyable ensemble road movie - funny stuff
","I saw Little Miss Sunshine a week ago at the Sydney Film Festival, and the audience I saw it with loved it. There was a lot of laughter going on - especially at the hilarious ending. And amidst the jokes it deals smartly with it's theme of the value of chasing your dreams and being one of life's 'winners' versus valuing what you already have. Or put another way, it celebrates the joys of losing in a culture obsessed with winning.",/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2006,Pavel-8,8," Probably the best comedy of 2006.
","Comedies about families usually come in one of two genres. Often featuring dysfunctional families (are those two words redundant?), they are either broad and goofy (""Cheaper by the Dozen"") or dark and abstruse (""The Royal Tenenbaums""). Driving its Volkswagon bus down the middle of these two extremes is ""Little Miss Sunshine"", a comedy both inclusive and exclusive, one that some will get entirely, while others will whiff on to the same degree.",/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2006,ArizWldcat,9," Hilarious! I loved this fun, but slightly dark comedy
","We were happy to have had the chance to see this at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. I loved the cast: Greg Kinear, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin, Abigail Breslin, Paul Dano and Steve Carrell were ALL marvelous as the dysfunctional family. Little Miss Sunshine refers to a pageant to be held in California (the movie never states where the family lives, but most of the road scenes were definitely in the Phoenix, Arizona area. (added 8/2/06: I know now that the movie is set in New Mexico, for those of you who are interested in that sort of thing!)",/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2006,jluis1984,9," A black comedy with a Little Big Heart
","The world of Independent film-making is definitely a tough one, as often the difficulties of getting a good budget or a good cast can become a difficult test to even the best directors. For that and many other reasons, it's always good to see a good independent films receiving the praise and recognition they deserve, proving that the support of a big studio is not necessary to make a product of high quality. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" certainly has been luckier than most Indies in terms of budget and cast, but it still is a modest black comedy that takes advantage of its own limitations and relaying only in great acting and a lot of heart, makes more than the hundreds of comedies the big studios make in a year.",/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2021,bombersflyup,10," She's kickin' ass... that's what she's doing.
",Little Miss Sunshine is an evoking offbeat family comedy drama.,/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2021,CinemaClown,," A Joy To Behold
","Conjuring endless joy & heartwarming feels by bringing together an array of flawed characters, piling them all up in a Volkswagen van and sending them on a road trip, Little Miss Sunshine is the story of a dysfunctional family rediscovering themselves & each other over the course of their journey as they learn the importance of being together through the thick n thin and reforge their relationships.",/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2006,Robert_duder,10," Outstanding!! An absolutely brilliant satirical dark comedy
","I had heard a little about Little Miss Sunshine and it intrigued me enough to want to see it so I finally caught it on DVD and I was blown away by it's creative edge, it's unique blend of dark humor and painful human emotion. The film is quite simply brilliant!! Anyone who truly loves a very real and powerful story about families that will make you laugh as much as it will make you cry must see this film. What makes the film even more impressive is the outstanding ensemble cast that captures every moment of comedy in such a twisted manner that you almost feel guilt for finding the absolute hilarity in their mixed up and disturbed road trip. On top of that co-directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris are long time partners who have pioneered direction in music videos and documentaries but never truly a feature film and yet they smash one out of the park with this incredible story.",/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2022,jtindahouse,9," An amazing cast where a 9-year-old is the best part - unheard of
",It's a big risk when you base your movie around a child. Nine times out of ten it will end in an annoying disaster. The likes of 'Home Alone' are the exception. 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a rare case of getting it oh so right. Abigail Breslin was fantastic in this movie.,/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv

30 May 2021,drewnes,6," ""I'd like to dedicate this to my grandpa, who showed me these moves.""
","I feel bad that everyone loves this movie and I thought it was just fun. I can see what they were going for, but for the most part I was felt depressed and a little anxious while watching it. That being said, Abigail Breslin is what made this movie for me! Her performance cracked me up, and the famous scene made it worth the wait.",/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2008,Chrysanthepop,," Like A Ray of Sunlight
","'Little Miss Sunshine' tells a fascinating and hilarious story of a dysfunctional family that includes a cigarette-addicted mother Sheryl (Toni Collette), her suicidal brother Frank (Steve Carell), her voluntarily mute son Dwayne (Paul Dano), her obsessed-with-winning husband Richard(Greg Kinnear), his eccentric father Edwin (Alan Arkin) and her 7 year old daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin). I usually enjoy movies and shows about dysfunctional families, perhaps because my family's that way and it is this dysfunctional quality that makes them more fun for me. Directors Dayton and Faris do a good job as they stick to the main story. 'Little Miss Sunshine' can also be watched as a fun road movie where we are presented with some beautiful landscapes and some of the dialogues during the characters' journey are of laugh out loud quality and yet it keeps the authenticity of the relationships and situations intact.",/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2006,tedg,," Freaks
","Its a simple strategy. Introduce us to some damaged folks, folks that seem way beyond what we would accept. Then spend some time with them in such a way that we get to know them. Then at the end, compare them to ""ordinary"" people so as to trick us into grounding ourselves in the ""weirdos."" Along the way, give us quirky vignettes, alternately endearing and humorous.",/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2006,lee_eisenberg,10," U can touch this!
","I have seen many movies about dysfunctional families, but rarely if ever have I seen one as good or as funny as ""Little Miss Sunshine"". It not only shows the fictional Hoover family's messed-up existence, but shows how daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) is the least damaged; maybe it's because she's the youngest, so there's hope for her.",/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2006,rasvag53,10," Simply perfect
","Do yourself a huge favor and go and see this film and then tell your friends about it. It has no special effects!!! No HUGE stars (though Kinnear and Arkin are famous and perfectly cast) This film has just great characters, unusual but perfectly understandable circumstances,fantastic dialog, wonderful actors,stunning cinematography, effortless direction and seamless editing.This film was very well received by the audience I sat with. I laughed,I cried and laughed until I cried. I heard that this film only cost three million dollars to make...it just goes to show that tens of millions need not be spent to get a treasure. Go see it and be thoroughly entertained. This is one good old-fashioned movie for everyone over 13 (if you preempt the grandfather's language, which is really part of his character). Hope it gets some nominations!!!",/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2007,theoriginalonegirlrevolu,8," Bittersweet and almost unbearable, in every way.
","I get so disgusted with Indie films about deep characters that have no real personality. Everyone says that they're real because they suffer, when really it's the audience that suffers most. Movies are not supposed to take two hours of my life and leave me feeling vacant and hopeless. I want to spend those two hours with good people who are flawed, like those in my life I love most.",/review/rw1574977/?ref_=tt_urv
