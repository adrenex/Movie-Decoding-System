13 May 2017,Sober-Friend,10," The Show That Proves Life is Still Life
",I am a little biased here. I am in recovery. Sober for 20 years now. Everyday I am very grateful that I survived. I don't take my life for granted anymore. So when I herd about this show I had to watch. As soon as I was done was episode 1 I was the shows #1 fan.,/review/rw5602747/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2017,ggallegosgroupuk,10," Allison Janney is a genius
","Allison Janney made me do something I had never done before. To be devotedly attached to a sit-com. She has created a character in Mom that it's bloody irresistible. An awful mother that it's impossible not to love. That's only achievable if the actress playing her is a genius. Anna Faris playing her daughter is a total find for me. Wonderful and a perfect foil for Allison Janney who reminds me of some of my favorites from the past, Kay Kendall, Eve Arden, Mary Astor, Joyce Grenfell and at the same time, she's like nobody else. She had only one moment in Primary Colors but she's memorable and has an entrance in The Hours that took my breath away. I want to see her in a movie that showcases her extraordinary talents to the fullest. Is that too much to ask?",/review/rw5602747/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2020,pawanpunjabithewriter,8," Quite Enjoyable
","This is a review after completing 7 seasons of Mom, unlike many who write after watching 1 ep or the first season.
The characters are flawless. Christy is superb, her mom is smart. Other ladies have wonderful roles too. Season 1 started with a bang. The first episode was a lot more fun than other 20, however,22nd was the best. That's the best episode in the complete Mom series. However, there are many heart-touching episodes yet to come.
The story gets better, newer with every season continuing the cast, their problems and the AA. AA is something new we watched in recent years. This was something that we learnt from. However, as the story goes on, with AA always being the highest priority parts of it, it gets better if not funnier. Season 1 has the best comedy, fun, however, after that from every season we start connecting to them more and more which is always wonderful. Season 6 was the best of all followed by 3rd and 1st. Season 5 was the worst. Adam was great, second best after the most loving Christy. However, his brother sucked. As soon as the series progresses, the comedy centres Jill, which is a lot of fun. The show isn't as sexier as we expect it to be, only sex word is spoken atleast once in each episode. Not recommended with family, as words like Vagina, sex, penis, even boobs are taken regularly. Marjorie is the most decent one in that despite having her good share.
But I do recommend if that's okay for anyone. It has good humor, great characters, well-directed and good fun.

19 April 2015,californiaaries85,10," Absolutely fantastic
","I LOVE this show. A 7 rating overall is far too low for this great show. First of all, the gorgeous Allison Janney is BRILLIANT as Bonnie. She really never fails to make me laugh. Her character is so lovably messed up. ",/review/rw5602747/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2021,dbuckshnis,10," Good female supportive cast and excellent message
","It's sad ""Mom"" had to end because Anna Faris left. The entire series is worth watching and the last season sans ""Kristie"" was actually really inspiring, cohesive, thoughtful and shows the power of women & friendships & living sober. Great message to all - so sad that it had to end. Thank you Allison Janey... u r the best!",/review/rw5602747/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2021,swordsnare,6," Chuck Lorre and his Laugh Tracks
",Could've been better if didn't have that damned 80's/90's laugh track!! It is so distracting from really having the punchlines hit home. Anna Faris' comedic goofball comedic timing is lost with all that forced artificial laughter.,/review/rw5602747/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2013,CoolKid23,10," This show is so funny!
",I have to say first off I have always loved Anna Farris from the scary movie series and she does not disappoint in this sitcom at all. All these people saying that this show is negative and trashy are the same people that love two and a half men and watch it faithfully. I have laughed through every episode so far and can't wait to see how the whole series turns out. The woman who plays Anna Farris's mom is so funny and it kind of reminds you of the mother on two and half men. Don't listen to what other people say and watch for yourself before you make a judgment call. I see other shows that have a good rating like we're the millers which has no laughs in it whatsoever. We live in a generation where people see one thing they don't like an all of sudden everything about the show is bad.,/review/rw5602747/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2017,Hawkeye64,10," Violet
","I love this series for lots of reasons, but does the Violet character have to be so ungrateful and disrespectful toward her Mom and Grandmother? I get it that she's been raised in a dysfunctional family, but who hasn't? I REALLY don't like the way she talks to her Mom. The script is SO funny and the actors' delivery of their lines is right on. I get why Allison Janney got an Emmy, but Anna Farris should have gotten one also!",/review/rw5602747/?ref_=tt_urv

16 November 2018,toncincin,10," Such a wonderful show
",This show! It tackles very difficult things in life - in a touching way ... but never forgets the humor in life's happenings. The episode where Marjorie's husband died - and she said she felt relief was amazing. That was such a true and heartfelt statement. Yes-she was still sad; but relief is what she felt for Victor AND herself. The episode on 11/15/2018 made me cry. Violet tells her mother she's better without her mother in her life. I fully understand why. My father was an alcoholic and my mother tried to hide it from the world. When Violet said she was afraid to bring friends home AND deal with things no child should ever have to deal with - I understood. This show brings on a lot of emotions - laughing and crying --- just the way life is! Such a gem...,/review/rw5602747/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2013,drjgardner,7," Good First Episode
","""Mom"" is a refreshing, in-your-face comedy with so many laughs you don't get much chance to settle down. For many people it will be too crude, but for those who don't mind the raunchier side of TV, this one is just fine (and never as crude as ""Two and a Half Man"" has become). Multiple Emmy winner (""West Wing"") Alison Janney plays the mom to cute as a button Anna Faris (""Scary Movie"") who in turn is the mom to relative newcomer Sadie Calvano. They all share problems with addiction and sexual appetites which make for lots of jokes as well as some touching emotional moments. ",/review/rw5602747/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2020,mherrity,6," This is NOT Season 8~ But A Spin-off of Mom
",I stayed loyal to Last Man Standing thru 5 cast changes to the family until they replaced Molly Ephram as Mandy. I stayed loyal to Mom with 4 family members being written off the show. And now Christie is out. The premise is more of a spin-off with 5 damaged close-knit women talking about their problems at AA meetings then struggling single mom with kids trying to stay sober.,/review/rw5602747/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2013,fbcnova,8," Two and a Half Women
","OK so it's not what you want you children to model themselves after but then neither was producer Chuck Lorre's Two and a Half Men. This is sort of the female version of that great show and maybe it's because it's a mostly female cast that it seems to raise the ire of so many. I don't know or care, to me its funny. Anna Faris is wellÂ… Anna Faris and if you like her in things like the ""Scary Movie"" series then you will probably like her playing Christy who often innocently deadpans her way through raunchy or absurd situations with great comedic sensibility. Allison Janney plays Christy's Mom Bonnie who is the counterpart to Charley Harper's slutty mom Evelyn. The show probably could use a ""Berta"" but it has enough good characters to develop into the same sort of comedic juggernaut Two and a Half Men was, given some good writing. Time will tell.",/review/rw5602747/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2021,he88,2," Why Is It Still ""Mom?""
","The first few seasons you had Anna Ferris with her children, and her mother. The show was a funny look at the dynamics of these two mothers living and working things out together while raising the children. Added to this was some very realistic situation comedy around the AA way of life. Then they got rid of the kids so it became just the older mom and the younger mom with nobody to be a mom to. That's when the show took a bad turn. Anna Ferris's character became more and more like a adult child who became increasingly needy. The show added new characters and continued to lose its funny. They should have renamed it something like ""Bonnies Troop"" because that's what it's become. I thought I'd give it another try a week ago. I made it half way through. The humor just isn't there, and this annoying laugh track has an audience laughing in the dumbest of scenes.",/review/rw5602747/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2021,jeersNcheers,10," I was worried... but it's all okay!
","We all know this was the Bonnie and Christy, mom and daughter show, so I was real concerned when Christy left the show. BUT, it has worked out fine. Don't get me wrong, I missed Anna Faris, especially the first 4 or 5 episodes of the 8th season. But all the characters have been given bigger roles and have risen to the occasion, and the plots have been ingenious and funny, so it's all good! I would like to see boyfriend Andy come back, and if/when he does, I'd like to see more of him. He is really cute and funny, and he and Adam have a great bromance!",/review/rw5602747/?ref_=tt_urv

25 March 2020,ervinaerchy,10," Genius, whoever put this cast together!
","I am almost without words how genius this show is.
First, the cast is incredible. Without Allison it's unimaginable, that's for sure cause she's a straight up genius, but the rest of the cast is pretty incredible too.
Second, It's everything. Inspiring, moving, loving, heartbreaking, women empowering, romantic, shocking, sad, happy and incredibly funny. It's a freaking life! You can find a little of yourself in almost every situation and also see how to do it right next time or at least how to try and do your best in life..
Third, I just can't get over how incredibly amazing Allison (Bonnie) is. I don't know if this is maybe close to what she's like in real life but I am totally feeling her Bonnie character. I truly adore that woman!",/review/rw5602747/?ref_=tt_urv

","To the person who says: ""I was treated to a story about a 40 year old woman and her elderly mother buying a house together."" Clearly, you have never watched the show. Anna Faris/Christy, was 37. Allison Janney/Bonnie, was 54 (hardly ""elderly""). And they never tried to buy a house together.",/review/rw5602747/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2021,lee_eisenberg,9," Chuck Lorre, you've done it again
","Having created a new type of show with ""The Big Bang Theory"", Chuck Lorre has also given us ""Mom"". It's refreshing to see a show that looks at people having to do what they can in desperate situations (and in particular, one with a mainly female cast). Anna Faris, Allison Janney, and their co-stars give it their all. Definitely watch it.",/review/rw5602747/?ref_=tt_urv

","Chuck Lorre is one of the creator of the show, who is one of the best currently Hollywood has. The series follows the love hate relationship between a Mom played by Academy Award Winner Allison Janney alongside Anna Faris as her Daughter, keeping with their sobriety with a struggling Economic & Social conditions. Mom has every set of emotions including Humor, Laughs, Sadness, happiness etc. Allison Janey is the Star of the show. She has also got Emmy for her role as Bonnie Plunkett .With some good performances by its regular and recurring cast along with a strong message & writing this Tv-series is totally recommended",/review/rw5602747/?ref_=tt_urv
