7 December 2017,blanche-2,8," Anger begets more anger
","Frances McDormand is a grieving mother who puts up ""Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri"" in this 2017 black comedy directed by Martin McDonagh.",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2017,tyson-hunsaker,9," A thought-provoking and darkly comedic drama with lots to say.
","""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" marks a milestone for writer/directer Martin McDonagh and is an idea piece on a mother's struggle with her town after posting billboards containing a call to action in regards to her murdered daughter. With outstanding screen writing and near perfect editing, this powerhouse of a film is easily one of the best all year and is driven with force and intensity by its lead, Frances McDormand.",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2018,Semisonic,9," Anger, what it begets, and what to do about it
","When you think about great cinema, you often imagine some grandiose epic setting which all that greatness builds upon. The likes of Gone With the Wind or Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption, such films span through decades or cover the major historic events.",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2020,pedroborges-90881,8," Very good film with amazing writing and acting
","Is kinda rare to see a female and male character fit so well on screen, Frances McDormand and Sam Rockweel perfomances are amazing, Woody Harrelson is also great, in fact everyone in this film is great, even the characters with short time on screen, that's great writing, direction and acting.",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2017,rubenm,9," Extremely funny film about grief, anger, revenge and violence
","It seemed that the pregnant police detective Marge Gunderson from 'Fargo' would forever be the most memorable character of Frances McDormand's acting career. But now I'm not so sure. Mildred Hayes, the heroine from 'Three Billboards', is a serious contender. This might well be her best performance ever.",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2018,TheLittleSongbird,8," Comedy, tragedy and morality rolled into one
","Saw 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' on the promise of one of the year's best trailers, the immensely talented cast, the intriguing subject matter, the receiving and pending of numerous accolades and being familiar with Martin McDonagh's previous work. ",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2017,chicagopoetry,7," Beware the p(l)ot holes near the billboards
","I will say that I enjoyed this film, mostly due to Frances McDormand's performance. It was surprisingly funny given its subject matter. But after thinking about it for a few days after watching it, I have to say a few words about the writing, because it seems everyone is raving about how ""Oscar worthy"" the writing here is, and at first glance, I thought so too. But thinking back on it, I'd have to say the writing is actually pretty sloppy. There's a lot of stuff here that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and I mean a lot. I can't explain this without revealing spoilers, so be warned.",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2017,FallonTimberlake2016,10," A comedic masterpiece with a stellar leading performance from Frances McDormand.
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a dark comedy that has an a-list cast with names like Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, John Hawkes, and Peter Dinklage. It centers around Mildred Hayes, a woman whose daughter was raped and killed, and who believes that the local police have not done enough about it. In reaction, she erects three billboards outside of her town that send a message to the sheriff about the state of the investigation.",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2017,MongoLloyd,4," Is this a masterpiece?
","Pretty cool cast, and interesting premise muddied by oddities, implausibilities, and a juvenile sense of story. Is this a film set in a world where crazy stuff happens as a matter of course, or a normal every day world where crazy stuff happens every now and then? In this film, I see pretty normal people doing normal things and having normal things happen to them, so why is it the writer/director chose to litter what could have been a very good film with SO much bizarro bs? And with literally ZERO character development? ",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2017,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,9," A dark, twisted comedy about grief, tragedy and three billboards
","Having recently won the People's Choice Awards at TIFF, Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is very easy to see why it won.",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2017,damian-fuller,9," Fires Of The Heart
","Frances McDormand is, without question, one of the very best actresses of hers or any generation. Wow! And like most of the greatest she goes for characters who don't ask for sympathy. The truth is in her eyes, always. So, naturally, I followed her every inch of the way. She is surrounded by a fantastic group of actors. Woody Harrelson is just extraordinary but perhaps the biggest surprise is Sam Rockwell making his one eighty not just believable but very moving. Martin McDonagh's writing is the magic potion that keeps everything together and when I say everything I mean everything. Humor and horror as if it were practically the same thing. The dialogue is brilliant and Frances McDorman deserves the last paragraph. Her face is a wonder. Superb performance. Don't miss it.",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2022,PedroPires90,9," Real world
","I'm completely tired of people who think films should only have black or white characters, people who think films should not show racism, homophobia, stupid people, like that is not...the fu****' real world? That's why I think I like this much. It's not afraid to shock and it's not afraid to make you think. Good people make some bad things. Bad people make some good things. People can change. I know this is a lot for this new world order where you are right 100% of the time or wrong 100% of the time, but this is what being human means.",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2018,areatw,8," Unusually deep for a crime drama
","Original, deep and thought provoking films like this one are hard to come by these days. 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' takes a completely different approach to the conventional crime drama. Instead of detailing the story behind the missing girl, the focus is instead of the mother's way of dealing with the disappearance and how she handles her grief and anger towards the authorities.",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2018,Lejink,1," Ebbing away
",I'm not much of a fan of the whole Coen Brothers non-linear method of film making I have to say and identified quite early on that this particular movie fell squarely into whatever category that might be. I guess I should have known from the offbeat title and cast that things would go every which way but loose and so it proves.,/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2017,Turfseer,3," Overrated quirk-fest from playwright turned screenwriter, seeks redemption for vigilantes
","Combine the quirky characters of the master of quirk, Wes Anderson, and sensibility of adolescent wish fulfillment fantasy director Quentin Tarantino, and what do you end up with? The year's most overrated ""black comedy,"" Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. It's the work of playwright by trade, Martin McDonagh, who's been quoted as saying that he prefers writing for film over theater (why couldn't he stick with the stage if that's his primary area of expertise?).",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2018,Coralknight,2," A LOT to overlook
","OK, let's just forget all the plot-holes here; like the fact that two people sitting in front of a burning police station would not simply be ""free to be on their way"". Or like a police officer throwing another man out a window and being witnessed by the police chief would simply be asked to turn in his badge and gun. Or that a woman who has an apparent blood-lust, capable of fire-bombing a building and watching a man on fire simply crawl out while doing nothing would let another strange man threaten her, break her items, then just let him walk away without reporting it. Yes...let's forget these and the MANY other plot holes in this entire mess...and what are we left with? Just a sad, bitter sermon on how all men are just plain evil if left to their own devices...yet white women must always get a pass in life (just because...don't ask why or you're a misogynist!) What this campy, meandering, cartoonish and pointless film DOES confirm is that most people are idiots, and will ""love!"" any film that confirms their belief or opinions.",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2018,bkoganbing,9," Inconsolable grief
","It's ironic that the first of Frances McDormand's Oscars came for her portrayal of a
sheriff in Fargo. For her second one she plays the antagonist to a sheriff she
feels isn't doing her job. The sheriff is a most popular individual in the town,
Woody Harrelson. But this is a woman with a mission.",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2021,Sleepin_Dragon,9," A powerful film that draws many emotions.

10 January 2018,claudio_carvalho,7," Deceptive Ending Without a Conclusion
","""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is a great crime movie in an environment of grief, anger, remorse, racism, violence, sympathy and a sophisticated black-humor. The performances are top-notch and it is hard to point out only one or two names in the cast, indeed a constellation of stars. Maybe the performances of Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell may be highlighted since they are the lead. Unfortunatelly the deceptive ending without a conclusion throws cold water in this film. The redemption of Dixon finding the rapist killer would have given some hope to the story. But the author decided to keep a dark ending without conclusion. Claude Chabrol was a master in mystery films with open end; however his conclusion were subtle and ambiguous, giving the chance to the audience to discuss possibilities based on his or her interpretation of the storyline. But the conclusion of ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is indeed a cliffhanger usually used in TV series or films written for franchise or at least a sequence. My vote is seven.",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2021,ronakkotian,10," This is how a drama should be!
","Martin McDonagh has made critically acclaimed throughout his career. I haven't seen In Bruges but I liked Seven Psychopaths. However, it's with Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri that made me realise what a talented writer and director he is.",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2018,ramfat,4," The best way to express your grief is by committing multiple felonies.
","First, let's all just accept the premise that police beat up random black people for no reason whatsoever. Also, police are inept, because they can't find someone to arrest for the murder and rape of your daughter, even though there is zero forensic evidence. Next let's take a moment to reflect on the time you told your daughter ""I hope you get raped on the way too"". Now it's time to start lashing out at the world because you are angry. Start by committing 2 felonies against a dentist. It's also a good idea to go into a police station and tell them what horrible people they are. When your signs get set on fire, climb onto one of the burning signs and stand at the top of the flames. Next, fire-bomb a police station, because you are still mad, even though there is still no evidence or suspects. Finally, if you can't find the actual person who committed the crime, instead go murder a complete stranger on a hunch. This is all very profound and heart-wrenching...can't you tell by the music?",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2018,gradyharp,10," 'All this anger, man, it just begets greater anger.'
","Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) wrote and directed this very tough but brilliant story about anger, revenge, agony, prejudice - and redemption. Every character in this dramatic tour de force is drawn with equal parts hate and anger - with a dollop of hope and forgiveness and reconciliation in the end. It is a phenomenal achievement.

6 April 2019,Nathan_Needs_A_Username,9," Movie Review: Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri
","Three Billboards is equal parts heartbreaking and hilarious. The screenplay moves seamlessly between gut wrenching moments of human weakness and suffering to perfectly timed dark comedy. Frances Mcdormand leads an air tight cast playing a woman who would do anything to have her story told, every moment of her performance feels real and she captures the vulnerability of the character brilliantly. Woody Harrelson is extremely likeable throughout the film in one of his most engaging roles to date and Sam Rockwell completely transforms into a racist, brutal and incredibly stupid cop nailing both the humour and unexpected heart behind the character. The cast is by far the best thing about this movie and it is well worth checking out just to see these amazing actors take on a really great script.",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2018,SnoopyStyle,6," so many issues
","In the town of Ebbing, Missouri, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) rents three billboards on an isolated road to berate police chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) for his failure to find her daughter's killer. Willoughby is actually dying from cancer and the town ostracizes her. Dixon (Sam Rockwell) is a volatile racist deputy living with his overbearing mother.",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2017,cdcrb,4," bitterness and hate rolled into one
","it's unfortunate to use the word comedy, dark or otherwise, with regard to this film. unpleasant would be a better adjective. if you've seen the trailer you know what the billboards are about. if not, you'll know when you see the movie. revenge and guilt are being served up cold. deep down, apparently, every one has a heart of gold. racists, wife beaters. whatever. I did not buy it. others have.",/review/rw3854540/?ref_=tt_urv
