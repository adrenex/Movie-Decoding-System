30 April 2020,curtisthomas-03634,1," TRY HARDER OR GIVE UP
","TP continues to half-ass his way through poorly written, directed and produced shows, and expects us to love his shows just because he's black and they're about black people. But he constantly insults our intelligence with his output. He owns a large studio, yet his sets seem extremely low budgets, his apartments, offices etc seem almost like stage play sets. Dialogue, plots and continuity are poorly executed. Imagine that the police comes to arrest a guy in a hospital saying it's for murder and the supposed victim is alive in the very same hospital! TP needs to relinquish some writing and directing to more talented persons or step up his game. And get rid of the always smug look on his face.",/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2020,kingwyatt,1," Badly written
",10 minutes of ridiculous content made 40 minutes long with dramatic pauses and characters repeating the same line back and forth to each other. Even 1970's daytime soap operas weren't this redundant and constipated.,/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2019,mimiybyazphil,1," You should be ASHAMED!!
","It is a good thing you are
already filthy rich, Tyler
because you have gone
off the deep end, with your crazy new, ah ""soaps""
The actresses are pretty
but that is the ONLY good thing about this
steaming pile of mess!
My mom loved your shows, it is a good thing
she went to Glory BEFORE she saw your two new shows!
and WHY so many darn
commercials BET!!?
one EVERY 6 to 8 minutes, then 6 minutes long!! I only watched to
see Tyler's shows, I shall
NOT return!!",/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2020,david0188,3," Stereotypical
","Why does Tyler Perry only portray gay men as extremely feminine. It's so annoying. As a matter of fact, all of his characters are extreme. So unrealistic",/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2020,CriticsVoiceVideo,1," Cheap and very bad.
","The worst. Horrible, amateur, and cheap all around..",/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2021,leerevell-69549,1," Terrible acting, plots and sets
","Cheap nasty sets, terrible acting and so badly written I had to turn it off.
They got a season 2, unbelievable",/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2020,DE179,1," Oh, it's bad.
","I gave this show a chance thinking 'Hey, how bad could it really be?' Oh, it's bad.",/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2021,eacmacro-01305,1," Ugh
","Why is it that I can tell when it's a TP show, without even watching the TV? The actors, especially on the drama-types...TERRIBLE! And the mood music...cheesey. It always sounds like each actor is waiting for another's prompt. SMH.",/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2020,fireleosnake-71661,1," LOLLLLLLL
","Sistas is the first ...and last ...Tyler Perry show I will ever watch.
the writing is like it was written by uneducated unimaginative 19 year olds.
over acted. poorly acted. even the serious parts are hillarious in all the wrong ways.
makes black (and all ) women look like mushy brained weak deviant losers that cannot live without D. Horrendous. Ridiculous. a real brain cell killer.",/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2021,Cat4117,1," Garbage
",Hot garbage like the rest of his shows. Nothing more to say.,/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2021,Cat4117,1," Got to be kidding me
",Anyone that could give this pile of garbage more than 1 star says a lot about that person. I'm all about supporting my black directors and producers but Tyler has consistently put out trash. I don't support trash no matter the ethnicity. The acting is horrific. I watched maybe 2 episodes of the first season and I was done. Can't believe this mess has a second season.,/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2019,DrMaxLaugh,5," Very Uneven
","The tone of the show is very uneven. It switches between comedy and drama in a jarring manner, and many of the sets look cheap. I was looking forward to a show about black women in a positive light, but it seems that the women in this show based their lives around men and not themselves. Hopefully it will improve in time, but so far, I'm not impressed.",/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2019,movielover2011,4," Uggghhh another Tyler Perry show?
","Every movie or show he makes is nothing but black stereotypes, even if he doesn't cast the black people as drug dealers and prostitutes it is the same stereotypical plot that reads as though he truly dislikes black women.",/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2021,mufflove-88833,1," show is awesome!!
","Not feeling the Karen being a hater, like really, you couldn't write nothing else for her to do then be a whole ass hater.!!! You can't tell somebody you don't want them and get mad when they move on. #team-zatima!!!",/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2019,tgomez-60946,1," I can't believe what I saw
","This show is so poorly written, it's hard to review. The production is cheap and the sex scenes are cheaper. I didn't back out of the program, I turned the TV completely off. They are right",/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2020,manuelheichlinger,1," Pile of rubbish
","Watched 5 minutes of it and had to turn off. The dialogues are so basic, the production value is low and the acting is so bad. I'm amazed somebody financed that pile of rubbish.",/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2020,sheilatayan,1," SO DISAPPOINTING
","Badly written, ave also noticed that the darker guys are portrayed to be so bad and the light skin guys are the good ones, the girls are portrayed to want the men's approval its such a bad show.",/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2022,catchthesmokeinc,1," Tyler Perry Stinks
",Tyler Perry is virtue signaling and trying to show women how much he values them by making men look like complete scumbags. Isn't Tyler on the DL anyway?,/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2019,mtjohnson-18549,6," A knockoff of Girlfriends
","This is a boring remake of the show Girlfriends. I couldn't even make it through the first episode because it was boring, stiff acting and the same one dimensional characters that are just black stereotypes. Do yourself a favor and watch reruns of Girlfriends. The acting, writing and characters are better.",/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2022,dprincess-18004,1," I hate this show
",I HATE THIS SHOW TAKE IT DOWN. Oml Karen is so annoying and werid like gtfo I don't like Karen I love the other girls thoðŸ˜©. But Karen no please Tyler Perry do more madea plays.,/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2020,sororsalsa,1," Tyler Perry Hates Women, But I Think He Hates Black Men More
","I would love to be able to support a Tyler Perry show, but I can't. This man who brags about writing all of the scripts for all of his shows, but doesn't understand that the statement is not a positive. This show is the most meandering, nonsensical drama (?) I've seen in a long time.",/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2021,wangiralaura,1," Booring
","I wonder how he gets to release so many episodes on this shows... 4 episodes people still on the same story. The words are drugged, repetition, idle just fake. Never watching anything relating to Tyler perry.",/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2021,mj-75483,1," Help
","Help is what Tyler Perry needs to make this show better. Help with writing, producing, and acting lessons for these beautiful ladies especially the one who plays Danni. Is she supposed to act drunk in every scene? I keep watching hoping it'll get better to no avail.",/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2019,coolfilms,2," Very disappointed
","I have been a fan of Mr Perry's shows my whole life but this is too much for me. His shows used to be tasteful but now... I dont understand the overuse of nudity and sex scenes in this show. Is it just for ratings? Really threw me off. What did they add to the show? To be honest,the acting could be better as well. I know for sure that this show doesn't represent me or my girlfriends. I am sadly not going to watch it.",/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2020,deputygirlfoster,4," Beautiful People, Low Budget Production
",I did binge watch the series when I stumbled upon it. I was excited about it.....but then I could not help but notice and wondered why it's such low a budget production? Tyler Perry has money (?) and his name is on this. It's really disappointing to see such low budget work from him for black actors. You could do so much better.,/review/rw5480108/?ref_=tt_urv
