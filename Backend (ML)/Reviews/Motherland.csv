","The movie was not unlike other movies where you see the good guy go rogue after rough handling by ""the system"". But I really liked the development of the characters in the beginning, and I am sure I am not the only one out there hoping that the ""Law Abiding Citizen"" would be able to pull it off.",/review/rw4317881/?ref_=tt_urv

","I never rooted for Jamie Fox's character, I wanted Butler to kill everyone. The director failed to make me see Butler as a villain. If that was the intention, it didn't mesh. Fun movie though.",/review/rw4317881/?ref_=tt_urv

",This is a great idea. A technical genius who is somehow able to commit revenge murders from his jail cell. He doesn't hide the fact he's a killer; in fact he announces each murder just before it happens.,/review/rw4317881/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2012,Leofwine_draca,6," Seething expose of America's justice system
","LAW ABIDING CITIZEN has all the trademarks of a great film. A non-linear plot, plenty to say about the state of the world today, some tough performances and explosive sequences. Best of all, it blurs the line between good and evil so that you're never quite sure who you're supposed to root for, which guy's the villain and which guy's the hero.",/review/rw4317881/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2010,claudio_carvalho,6," Promising Beginning, Disappointing Conclusion
","In Philadelphia, the family man Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is violently attacked at home by two punks and his wife and daughter are rapped and murdered by Clarence Darby (Christian Stolte). The two criminals are arrested by the police but the ambitious D.A. Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) makes a deal with the assassin Darby that accuses his partner to keep his average of convictions in court despite the protest of Clyde. Ten years later, Darby's partner is executed by lethal injection but the defective machine makes him suffer lots of pain. Meanwhile Clyde abducts Darby and executes him in a sadistic way. Clyde is arrested without evidences and Nick negotiates his confession. Sooner Nick discovers that the purpose of Clyde is not only vengeance, but to destroy the corrupt justice system and the head of the city that released the assassin of his family.

3 December 2009,agibaer,4," Good movie screwed up completely in the last 15 minutes
","Just watched LAW ABIDING CITIZEN. I don't know why i still bother watching American movies. It's a decade-long Hollywood tradition to screw up good ideas by illogical plots and happy endings. The WHOLE point of the movie, bringing DOWN the legal system could only be proved if Shelton was to walk free after all he did. To show that the legal system was unable to hinder him murdering people though being in custody AND had to set him free, because the DA and the judge broke the law to stop his series of murder thus ignoring his civil rights which would ultimately lead to dismissing all charges. The supposed plot to blow up the mayor and homeland security does not at all fit neither the character of Shelton nor the plot of the movie. Good movie screwed up completely in the last 15 minutes.

18 February 2010,jlamarca,4," Typical Hollywood BASTARDIZED ENDING!!!
","Come on Hollywood, this guy was so clever, tactful & brilliant & yet you expect the audience to believer that he wouldn't even have a bloody security system installed on the very building, which was the only means of exit & entry to his prison cell... never mind that the building housed nerve & command center, from which he executed his flavour of justice!",/review/rw4317881/?ref_=tt_urv

17 May 2012,Buddy-51,7," Entertaining if occasionally implausible thriller
","""Law Abiding Citizen"" starts out like a modern-day version of ""Death Wish,"" spends a few moments aping the ""Saw"" franchise, then settles in as a cat-and-mouse crime drama centered around the theme that the American legal system seems designed as much to thwart justice as to enact it.",/review/rw4317881/?ref_=tt_urv

27 July 2014,SnoopyStyle,6," Plot way too ridiculous after some contemplation
","Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) lost his family to two killers. The guys are caught but the case goes south. D. A., Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) is a wheeler dealer who has a 96% success rate. When some evidences get thrown out, Rice decides to do a deal with one perpetrator to convict the other. Years later, the execution is tampered with and goes terribly wrong. The other killer with the deal is also brutally murdered. Rice suspects Shelton but he only has circumstantial evidences. Shelton wants to show the justice system as being too lenient and he's willing to kill everybody in the system to prove it.",/review/rw4317881/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2009,Willie-12,6," A Movie That Loses Its Way
","Law Abiding Citizen, in a way, is a movie that became too big for it's own good. The Gerard Butler character was a mastermind. He was so intelligent that no one could figure out how he was doing the things he was doing. So crafty, that no matter what safety precautions were taken, people were still dying. The problem, though, became very apparent as Citizen was nearing the last half hour. How do you explain it all. It's almost as if 3/4 of this movie was made, and then the makers remembered that they had to end this thing. And so they did. Only what we were given, the resolution to it all, was so anticlimactic (and for that matter, unbelievable) that it was almost laughable. I think it would have been better to leave it a mystery then to give the audience what was one of the most outlandish conclusions to a film I've seen in a long time. That's not to say that what came before this was a masterpiece. The dialogue was, at times decent, and at other times sub-par. The characters were never developed enough for people to really care about what happened to them, and the editing left something to be desired. But even with all of that I was still interested. I still wanted to see where all of this was going, and how all of this was happening. I shouldn't have been so eager. They say that sometimes, the unknown is much more intriguing than the known. I guess the makers of this film should have kept that in mind.",/review/rw4317881/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2011,Hitchcoc,6," Way Too Many Contrivances
","Let's face it. Because a person is capable of pulling off the kinds of things done here, doesn't make the likelihood any greater. There is so much precision and luck involved in making things work that it would take a god pulling strings to allow these things to fall so easily into place. Even a silent partner is not going to do the job. I enjoyed the setup but the lengths gone through for revenge really pull it apart for me. The guy has so much power that he is completely in control. There would be a point in law enforcement where they would finally say, ""Screw you!"" The technology would have taken a fortune beyond imagination to work out. While I like the actors in this film, I can't recommend it's far fetched totality. Done in a more controlled and believable way, you have a stunner. It's just too much. And the ending is a real weakness.",/review/rw4317881/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2009,rasa06,8," Unsatisfying ending
","This movie was fabulous until the last 10 minutes. it was full of action and real characters. The characters had flaws. Through the entire movie Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) was not a character that I liked or sided with, while Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) was human and easy to empathize with. Although the entire movie required suspension of disbelief, the ending was unfulfilling and implausible given the rest of the movie. It was as if the villain was actually Rice with his corruptness, while Shelton was indeed a law-abiding citizen driven to vengeance by the corruptness of Rice and the justice system. The real disjustice was the ending of this movie. I kept expecting the intelligence shown by Shelton throughout the movie to come to a head in the ending. I was highly disappointed by the anti-climatic ending. Stop the movie about 10 before the end and create your own ending; it will be better than what was on-screen.",/review/rw4317881/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2009,hyprsleepy,," A morality tale with plenty of action
","This is a movie that's extremely fun to watch in the theaters because you get to hear and see everyone's reaction to each of his killings. The best one had people actually saying loudly ""wow"" and ""oh my god!"".",/review/rw4317881/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2009,leathalsac,8," Great Movie just don't watch the end.
","I didn't have high expectations for this movie and only went because my friend made me. That being said I loved it. I actually wanted to applaud and cheer at one point and I never do that. Clyde now ranks as on of my favorite characters ever. Now for the bad part. Jamie Foxx was horrible!!!!!!! I don't understand why directors and casting directors like to put bad actors against good actors. It seems to be an ever increasing trend in Hollywood. we saw it in ""the Italian job"" and we see it here. Jamie's acting was the worst I had seen in a long time. He showed no emotion at all. I would have liked to see a better actor cast but hey who am I? Also, listen up producers, the ending was ridiculous!!!! I mean come on. you build this character up only for a huge let down. That was by far one of the most irresponsible endings to a movie I have ever had the misfortune to see. When I tell people to see this I am recommending that they leave at a specific point about 15min before it's over and imagine your own ending because no matter what it will be better. Endings like that is the reason people watch independent films. This movie could have been an all time classic but for Jamie Foxx and the writer's lazy ending. It still may because I loved most of it. I pray someday producers figure out that we want something a little different and allow things to end the right way, the responsible way for their viewers.",/review/rw4317881/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2010,Quinoa1984,5," what starts as an intriguing *serious* injustice-revenge story turns stupid... and still serious
","F. Gary Gray needs to find his groove again. The director who debuted with Friday went ahead and became a director of dramatic films, like The Negotiator and A Man Apart, films that have their moments if they are, obsessively-repeated TV airings notwithstanding, forgettable. But with a film like Law Abiding Citizen, he should have taken a better look at Kurt Wimmer's script and seen what he had to work with. It's really two movies, sort of shoe-horned in to one another. The first one, at least in the first half hour, would appear to be an injustice-revenge flick where a guy watches in horror as two thugs break into his house and rape/kill his wife and child. But at the trial one of the thugs rats on the other, one of the thugs gets death row and the other pretty much walks. Then, years later, when the one thug is about to be killed by the lethal injection, he strikes his first blow of revenge... and then another... and then...",/review/rw4317881/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2010,DaShAg,7," Good but not great due to Foxx and bad ending
","Clyde Shelton's ( Gerard Butler ) wife gets murdered in the beginning of the movie and justice doesn't prevail because one of the killers is only sentenced for 10 years. Clyde is angry as hell and will make sure the people responsible for the horrible trial of the killers will all suffer and die. So basically you got yourself a revenge movie here. Clyde is killing them and isn't even hiding it, he admits it. Nick Rice ( Jamie Foxx ) is the DA on the case and needs to find out what the hell is going on. Now the fun part is that Clyde is performing the kills from within his prison cell, he even has to sit out in solitary and is still killing people, now how cool is that.",/review/rw4317881/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2019,classicsoncall,6," ""In my experience,..., lessons not learned in blood are soon forgotten.""
","The movie starts losing credibility right about the time Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) turns into a killing machine. It doesn't help, once he's incarcerated, that he manages to pull off the deaths of six Department of Justice employees, including lawyer Sarah Lowell (Leslie Bibb) working for the prosecution. Not quite the way one would go about garnering sympathy for the murder of his own wife and daughter. This was almost going to be one of those films in which the viewer becomes conflicted over the inadequacies of the justice system, but it becomes pretty clear that there's no one to root for here. Not even attorney Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), who's own frustration in dealing with Shelton turns him into an automoton seeking revenge instead of justice. Funny how a film titled ""Law Abiding Citizen"" turns out not to have any.",/review/rw4317881/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2009,markthompson147,3," Did the director fail to see the irony.
","OK so the premise of the ending is that, although the justice system is flawed, you cant just kill people to get your own justice and you are becoming what you hate and it will lead to your demise. So how does the director explain then that Foxx, the supposed good guy of the film, instead of using the justice system he represents to hold Butler accountable for his crimes, does instead just murder him in his cell. How does that make him any different to Butler. But Foxx murdering someone is apparently OK and he goes on to have a happy life watching his daughter play the cello. Murdering someone because they are murdering because of the murder of other people. Irony anyone.",/review/rw4317881/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2010,lazydawgotp,4," started out amazing and then went downhill.
","Spoiler alert! This movie had an awesome idea and would have been great but for the end of it. 1st off Jaime Foxx is supposed to be a bad guy, but they make him a good guy in the end. For crying out loud, he let a child rapist off the hook to further his career, and then they make him the hero in the end. And Gerard Butler's character is supposed to be a super genius that outsmarts the most wanted terrorists, only to get outsmarted by a a spoiled rich lawyer who neglects his family. It's like some amazing writer wrote the plot and then some jerk director comes in and changes the ending. Why can't Hollywood just give me a good ending to a movie.",/review/rw4317881/?ref_=tt_urv
