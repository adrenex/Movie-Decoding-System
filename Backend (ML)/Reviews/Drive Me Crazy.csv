28 July 2010,Quebec_Dragon,10," Awesome but not for everyone
","How to review this film without giving too much away? Throughout the film, I was constantly surprised and amazed. I think my mouth was hanging slightly open a few times from the brilliance on display. I was totally captivated from start to finish. Taken simply, it's a philosophical sci-fi film, but it's so much more than that. It's about choices, destinies, astrophysics, dreams and memories, just to name a few themes. Taken at its simplest, it's the jumbled recollections of the last mortal man, 118 years old, on Earth in 2092. The problem is that his memories are in total disorder and contradictory. In practice, it means that this is a very non-linear experience in terms of time and space, real and imaginary, showing you results of important choices either way. It doesn't focus on just 2 alternate lives either, things constantly branch out. You would think the film would be a mess, but it's surprisingly cohesive, gripping and even quite touching. I'm sure some will find it confusing, but that's part of the point: Mr. Nobody's memories seem confused and appearances might be deceiving. ",/review/rw7715631/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2014,cetaylor3,8," The quest for mutuality in love
","As Nemo looks back (from age 118, yearningly, and forward from age 9, predictively, drawing on a 9-year-old's storybook-even-horror-story-based clich√©d imaginings of adolescent/adult life and sci-fi future worlds), he sees his life's choices and their envisioned consequences pivotally stemming from one crucial choice at age 9, each path ""typed up"" as a draft of an alternate life. It's an existential tale of the power of choice to create the environments that reshape the persons who then choose from what life presents in their consequent environments, ad infinitum. It's a romantic tale in both the historic sense of quixotic, picaresque adventure multiply envisioned (including into distant time and space) and the modern sense of a quest for the idealized romance of heart and soul.",/review/rw7715631/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2010,olga1403,10," Why are you not watching it RIGHT NOW?
","There's one thing about this film that makes me overlook the flaws:it's like nothing I've ever seen before. Some people walked out 20 minutes before the movie ended. I can't really explain to myself why ANYONE would do that (it was really tempting to ask but I literally couldn't take my eyes off the screen). It's really pointless to describe the plot because this movie is so much more then any summary could say. This film has so many stylistic, tonal and narrative changes that it seems absolutely mad for the first half hour. It's easily the most unique and worthy cinema experience in the last year, its feels very current. I could go on and on about the things I loved about this film but there's nothing right now that I would recommend seeing more to a person of any age, sex or taste in cinema. It's everything I could ask for in a film:funny, touching, thrilling, surreal, beautiful...",/review/rw7715631/?ref_=tt_urv

","It is the year 2092. Nemo Nobody is 118 years old and is the last remaining mortal human on earth, as, due to medical advances, all other humans are immortal. He is being interviewed in order to document his life, but the stories he tells seem to run parallel to each other. How could he be in several places at the same time, living, as it were, multiple lives?",/review/rw7715631/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2010,Tieum,9," What have I done to deserve this ?
","Mr Nobody, Nemo Nobody, is now 100 years old, the last mortal on earth in 2092, and he is about to die. Questioned about his life on his death bed by a journalist that sneaked in the hospital, he tells the stories of his lives. Yes, lives, his three lives, his three destinies between which he was unable to choose from. Three love stories, three very different existences conditioned by apparently meaningless decisions. Three paths, three wives, three families, three fates.",/review/rw7715631/?ref_=tt_urv

This really out there movie, gives you a lot to think about (if you're up for it). It's also kind of a twisted version of Lola Runs.",/review/rw7715631/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2021,abhibnlcs,1," Wasted 2.5 hours on this mess pretending to be ""mind bending""
","This was a long, tedious, boring mess which I guess can be called a movie. Heard so much about it and people even compared it to Inception. I can't believe I wasted 2.5 hours on this. Usually at the end of ""mind bending"" movies you ask yourself questions and try to make sense of it, but not with this one. You are relieved it ended and at the same time curse yourself for watching this bs.",/review/rw7715631/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2021,ithearod,1," Unbearable, tedious, pretentious nonsense
","Long-winded, preachy, thinks highly of itself, and in the end, worthless. Had to skip through major chunks of wordless dialogue. Just unwatchable, not even pseudo-philisophical tripe. Awful, just tedious, boring, nonsense, awful. Seriously. I love good films. This is not a good film. This is a so bad its bad film. No redeeming value whatsoever.",/review/rw7715631/?ref_=tt_urv

9 September 2010,staffan-663-321070,9," Unforgettable
","This is the kind of film you don't see too often. It is truly a visual masterpiece. I haven't heard about this french director, but ""Mr Nobody"" really blew my mind in all its images, dreams, romance and complexity. The movie has similarities to films by Michel Gondry but i think this film was more magical. Dreamlike and existential films. Some might think Mr Nobody is too complex, too demanding. It is not for everyone, but I loved it. Like other surreal movies, Peter Jacksons ""The Lovely Bones"", and ""Synechdohe: New York"" ""Dr. Parnassus"", ""Micmacs""- these dreamlike and ""difficult"" films must be terribly expensive to produce and I ask myself how can the companies go through with these productions? These flicks never generate big box office money. Im amazed that they still make this kinds of demanding visual movies for cinema. And glad.",/review/rw7715631/?ref_=tt_urv

","about life and its labyrinth. about small things who gives sense to colors, meetings, hours. and circle of expectations. that is all. so, the movie can be a poem. at first sight, without many exploration. in fact, it is just definition. for a silhouette who explores each part of his way. for the smoke of every script for obtain happiness. for final dialog. for pages of memories. for self-definition. nothing else. and essence of this travel- mixture of nuances and fears, emotions and hidden lights is the look of central character. key to understand basic fact - his story is your story. gray, nice, sad, hopeless, ambiguous, cold, fast, gray, without precise end. each man is Mr. Nobody in relative measure. and final confession is same - search to understand a trip out of others. out of yourself.",/review/rw7715631/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2022,mistela67,4," Not for me
","Mr. Nobody is one of those movies that will appeal heavily to a particular audience. Personally, I have no interest in flawed relationships between teenagers, and later grownups. This movie just drilled down on the bad relationships over and over and over again. Moving about in different timelines and alternative universes is always interesting, but the soupy romance thing ruins that for me. Great ratings, so I'm sure it has its audience. I'm just not a part of it.",/review/rw7715631/?ref_=tt_urv

","One of the reasons a movie will be enjoyable to us is if we can identify with it. It has to be relatable. I could not relate at all to ""Mr. Nobody."" Honestly, I can't relate to most romances, but this one focused on teen love which is even more unrelatable. ""Mr. Nobody"" is a romance first and a sci-fi second. The sci-fi is just a backdrop to the romance.",/review/rw7715631/?ref_=tt_urv
