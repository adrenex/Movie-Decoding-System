2 March 2006,The_Void,8," Brutal and gritty gangster flick - hugely underrated!
","I'm shocked that I've been a film fan for many years, and have only just seen this gem! In a world where The Godfather and Goodfellas are at the top of most people's lists of favourites, it's hard to believe that a film as strong as State of Grace could be so criminally under seen. The film is about love, friendship and betrayal; and takes place in New York's infamous Hell's Kitchen. The fact that it was released in the same year as Martin Scorsese's more acclaimed 'Goodfellas' probably didn't do it many favours; but if you ask me, this is the better film. Boasting a strong cast, director Phil Joanou's film follows Irish-American Terry Noonan as he returns home after an absence of ten years. He soon hooks up with his old friends, including Jackie and his brother Frankie; who is now the head of the Irish mafia. However, it doesn't take long before Terry's rekindled relationship with his old friends and his new loyalties to another party become at odds with one another, and our hero soon finds himself torn between the two.",/review/rw1147453/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2007,Bladerunner•,10," Electrifying portrait of one man's battle with his own demons.
","Once in a while a movie comes along that is a gift for an actor. It is like a golden opportunity that has been given to them, but there is a catch they have to deliver. Three actors were given that opportunity in State of Grace: Ed Harris, Gary Oldman and Sean Penn. All three deliver performances that easily merit a Best Actor Oscar, but it is the chemistry between Penn and Oldman that issue forth true gold. Oldman completely and utterly loses himself in the role of Jackie Flannery, a small-time Irish gangster that happens to be the younger, impulsive, reckless brother of the head boss of the Irish mob in Hell's Kitchen, Frank Flannery. Frank is brokering a deal with the Italian Cosa Nostra that will result in a major windfall of money and power for the much smaller gang of Irish mobsters. Frank is one of the only people who seems to understand how important this deal is, while the rest of the gang bristles against the direction of the much more powerful and organized Mafia. Every time it looks like the deal will go through, some member of Frank's gang does something stupid to insult the Italians, and each time this happens Frank is called upon (by the Italians) to do their retribution upon his own people.",/review/rw1147453/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 1999,studiojudio,10," Another SEVERELY Overlooked Film
","Aside from being a great, dark film, with a substantial plot line and a GIANT cast (Oldman, Penn, and Harris), this is an Oldman performance not to be believed.  Mr. Oldman himself has been quoted as saying that ""State of Grace"" is HIS favourite performance.  And, as usual, he gives a performance to be equalled by none.",/review/rw1147453/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 1999,Mr Parker,," One of the best. And DeNiro's not in it.
","Simply put, this movie is perfect. I live in NYC and the general air of it is caught perfectly on film. The people, the places, everything. I especially like the bluish tint used over a lot of the film. It definitely adds to the mood. The performances are incredible, even Burgess Meredith in the couple of minutes that he has onscreen. Sean Penn and Ed Harris together create an unbelievable amount of tension. I have to give them both kudos and especially Robin Wright, who turns in an excellent performance as the frustrated love interest who's connection to the life follows her no matter how far uptown she moves. No surprise when I say that Gary Oldman takes the cake for this one. He manages to outshine everyone around him, just like he did in the Professional. His performance is the driving force behind this movie and it is worth watching just to catch this legend in the making in one of his earlier roles. I cannot find one flaw in this movie and the slow motion finale is among the top five ending sequences ever. Every viewing reveals something else, something to make you appreciate this film even more. Catch this one if you haven't seen it, you won't be disappointed. My only regret is that I didn't see it while it was in theatrical release. One of the best gangster flicks, period. Rating: ***** out of *****.",/review/rw1147453/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2000,fowler1,," Is there ANYTHING Gary Oldman can't do?
",".....up to and maybe including walk on water? Oldman is so utterly and completely Jackie Flannery in this film, you might be tempted to dismiss his performance as 'playing to type'. Until you see this inspired chameleon's other work, where he IS Lee Harvey Oswald or TRUE ROMANCE's Drexl or Joe Orton or - tell you what, YOU pick the role. Oldman inhales, and the character he's portraying exhales. (And this is not to shortshrift the incredible work offered by Penn, Harris, Wright, Reilly and the rest of this film's ensemble.) It's disgraceful that Hollywood can't think of anything better to do with this brilliant and courageous actor these days than 'villain roles' in big-budget comic books like LOST IN SPACE, but when he's working with material commensurate to his skill, he's without peer. When an actor pushes himself like this, takes risks like this, you become aware that there can be no nobler profession. Gary Oldman may not be 'box office', and now and then he may even crash and burn...but when he flies, he soars higher than any performer presently working. For Pete's sake, see this movie and everything else he's done.",/review/rw1147453/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2000,Dodger-9,," One of Oldman's best
","You don't need to be a film genius to realise the gangster thriller is as old as cinema itself, although by the Seventies, it was looking a little ragged around the edges.",/review/rw1147453/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2000,EW-3,," Very well done
","""State Of Grace"" is a film loosely based on the story of the ""Westies"", the New York Hells Kitchen Irish mob that thrived during the 70s and early 80s. This gang of hoods was extremely violent and unpredictable, and even gave most of the Italian Mafioso (who far outnumbered them) the jitters. Gary Oldman is phenomenal in this film. He is a highly versatile actor in a class by himself, or at the very least, belongs with the likes of Olivier and DeNiro, in that Oldman has proven himself in a wide range of diverse roles besides this one (e.g., in ""JFK"" as Lee Harvey Oswald, in Dracula as the title role, and even in ""Lost In Space"" as Dr. Smith). If nothing else, see it for him. But kudos must also go to Sean Penn and Ed Harris for their excellent performances as well. Sean Penn in particular was very well cast. The story is believable, the atmosphere is realistic, and the acting keeps you on the edge of your seat. A very good modern-day crime film.",/review/rw1147453/?ref_=tt_urv

7 March 2019,jadavix,5," A mess
","""State of Grace"" is one of those movies that feels like it doesn't deserve the performances it features. Obviously, Gary Oldman in psycho mode is always worth the price of admission, but ""State of Grace"" also has Sean Penn going through the emotional wringer, and Robin Wright, Ed Harris, and an early role from John C. Reilly.",/review/rw1147453/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2008,Panterken,9," A genre classic.
","'State Of Grace' is a well-crafted gangster film from start to finish. From the appropriate saint-paddy's day parade opening-scene to the legendary parallel montage in the end, and everything in between. A fairly lengthy film, SOG never bores but sucks you in and though it doesn't stray far away from the basic gangster genre plot lines and characters, it's got a very own feel to it. This is due to the great Morricone score and the witty dialog, SOG is hilarious at times but overall takes itself seriously. Morricone's soundtracks are legendary for a reason and though this is certainly not one of his best, it does add a lot of class to the picture. I'm sure many of you will agree that the music is very reminiscent of his work in The Untouchables and even more so his work in Once Upon A Time In America (the greatest thing Leone has ever accomplished). The recurring theme always stirred up feelings of nostalgia and a melancholious sadness with me, it quickly gets under your skin and stays there for the rest of the movie. It goes well with the themes of hearth ship and longing for the happiness of youth often appearing in the script.",/review/rw1147453/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2017,NateWatchesCoolMovies,10," Searing gangster epic
","Phil Joanou's State Of Grace had the unfortunate luck of being released in 1990, the same year that also saw Scorsese's Goodfellas and the third Godfather film. It's hard to gain your footing when that kind of momentum is surging about, but this film is as good as the others, and deserves recognition or at least some kind of re-release. Set in the blistering inferno of Hell's Kitchen, NYC, it's a violent tale of Irish Mobsters, undercover cops, betrayal and murder, set to a smoky, mournful Ennio Morricone score that lingers in the air like smog. Sean Penn is Terry Noonan, a deep cover operative who returns to his childhood neighbourhood to reconnect with old friends, and dig up buried grudges. Ed Harris is Frankie Flannery, ruthless gangster and former ally, while Gary Oldman plays his hotheaded brother Jackie with a tank full of nitrous and the kind of unpredictable, dynamite fuse potency one expects to see from a David Lynch character. The three of them are on a collision course set in the grimy streets of New York, bound by old loyalties yet destined to clash and draw new blood. Penn shares the screen with his once wife Robin Wright here, looking lovely as ever. There's also supporting turns from John Turturro, John C. Reilly, R.D. Call, a geriatric Burgess Meredith and an unbilled cameo from James Russo. Penn, Harris and especially Oldman are like flint sparks, a trio that won't be stopped and light up the screen for a spellbinding, visceral two hours until their eventual confrontation, hauntingly shot by cinematographer "" in the midst of a bustling St. Patrick's Day parade. This one has been somewhat lost to the ages, like a number of other stellar crime dramas I can think of from the nineties. The cast, score and Joanou's thoughtful direction make it an unforgettable piece of work.",/review/rw1147453/?ref_=tt_urv

12 October 2005,manfran4,10," Simply One of The Best Films Ever Made
","The credits have just begun rolling on what has been my 7th full viewing of State of Grace. (This number doesn't count the times I've watched it after having missed some portion of the film.) I first saw this film as a rental some time around 1992, and it has not lost a bit of its relevance. It is nothing short of mesmerizing. Every time I watch it I'm pulled in completely. The performances are the reason this is one of my all-time favorite films. Gary Oldman was so convincing that I was surprised the first time I heard him speak in his native dialect. His performance in this film, as in virtually every film he's been in, was a thesis on acting. Sean Penn turned in a masterful performance that was complex and nuanced. And Ed Harris displayed his usual laser beam intensity. Everyone in this ensemble piece resonated perfectly to create this vivid story. I hope this film comes to be recognized as the classic I already believe it is.",/review/rw1147453/?ref_=tt_urv

","Phil Joanou's ""State of Grace"" had the misfortune of getting released around the same time as Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"", meaning that few people saw it. While it has similar qualities to Scorsese's movie, Joanou's movie is undeniably it's own thing.",/review/rw1147453/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2015,trublu215,10," One of the best hidden gems of the 90s
","State of Grace pits an undercover cop against the Irish mob in Hell's Kitchen that is coincidently ran by his best friends. Starring Sean Penn, Gary Oldman, Ed Harris and Robin Wright, this film is a masterpiece that was overshadowed at the time of its release to what would end up becoming the best mob film ever made, Goodfellas. State of Grace showcases powerful performances from Penn and Oldman along with Harris delivering one of the most interesting mob characters of all time with Frankie Flannery. Gary Oldman's performance as the volatile Jackie Flannery is some of the best work Oldman has done which makes it a bit frustrating considering this film could have scored him an Oscar nomination if it was released at a better time. Instead, Oldman would have to wait until some twenty years later to even get a nod. It is a true joy to watch him on the screen and he is one of the only actors who could have pulled that role off. No matter how violent Jackie is or how cold he is, you still root for him...even if he is playing with a dead man's severed hand. The screenplay is tightly wound, making it extremely difficult to walk away from it for even a second. Every scene builds with an incredible amount of tension and allows Penn to flourish as Terry Noonan, who is literally one step away from being figured out and his paranoia sometimes gets the best of him...and us for that matter. This is a film that NEEDS to be seen, it is an absolute blast of entertainment that has been swept under the rug for far too long and deserves an audience. Directed by Phil Joanau, it is a taut and suspenseful film that shoots out of the gate with fury and ends with somber, sobering note in a bar shootout during the St. Patrick's Day parade in New York City. This is grade A entertainment for anyone craving a good mob movie or a good film in general. Overall, I highly recommend this film, it is brutal, powerful and thoroughly captivating.",/review/rw1147453/?ref_=tt_urv

","Yeah, I love this film. Ever since I saw it at a preview screening, this has been one of my favorites. I said then Gary Oldman should get nominated for Best Supporting Actor and he should have been, except nobody saw this movie, probably because Orion didn't promote this movie at all. All of the leads are awesome. Sean Penn is so messed up and confused, and the hints that he's having trouble with all the drinking are a nice touch. Ed Harris does so much with so little. There's one scene where you can almost see him literally blow his top. By the end, the effects of each different subplot can be seen on each other, all coming together for one climactic moment. And the ending--I get chills from the music. See this movie. Then tell everyone you know.",/review/rw1147453/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2004,moonspinner55,2," Scorsese-wannabe
","Modern-day gangster drama involving Irish-American mobsters in New York's Hell's Kitchen District. Inspired by real characters, this tiresome film has good actors screaming and swearing at each other for over two hours. Dark and ugly throughout (with wonderful John C. Reilly dying in bloody close-up), the film may use 'real life' as a basis for its ideas, but Martin Scorsese is whom the filmmakers are trying to match. Director Phil Joanou muddies up everything; his vision is very puny and he doesn't shape the scenes with the characters in mind (they're incidental to how everything is staged vis-a-vis the camera). It's also a heavily-padded and clichéd picture: Robin Wright plays the proverbial girlfriend-from-the-right-side role (usually played in these things by Daryl Hannah or Lori Singer). *1/2 from ****",/review/rw1147453/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'll start with the positive, which is a great cast led by Sean Penn, and supported by Gary Oldman, Ed Harris, and John C. Reilly. They are all as good as expected. The negative is the over two hour length, and the overall darkness of the film. Sean Penn is Terry Noonan, and he has returned to Hell's Kitchen in New York after a long absence. He reunites with his old friends, Jackie and Frankie, and also hooks up with Jackie's sister, Kathleen. His buddies are members of the Westies, the notorious Irish mobsters of Manhattan.

","This a superbly acted film about an undercover cop( Sean Pen) who infultrates a group of American/Irish gangsters who he used to be friends with. The storyline is not the best but it does not have to be when you are watching people like Gary Oldman act his socks off. The film is shot superbly too , especially the fantastic gun fight at the very end in the Irish bar. If there was one critisism i have to make of this film it would be that it is a little too long which can make it feel a little slow.

He plays a long-haired Irish-American thug in New York's Hells Kitchen, employed by an Irish mob headed by his brother played by Ed Harris. This group is backed by the Italian Mafia, and Ed Harris's character is always trying to impress the Mob Chiefton. Sean Penn plays Gary Oldmans child-hood friend and fellow gangster, who left town one day years ago without notice. Now he's back, and welcomed heartily. Without question, he is accepted back into the gang, and put to work. Only problem is, when he left, he went to Boston to become a cop, and now he's undercover and infiltrating his old friends.
