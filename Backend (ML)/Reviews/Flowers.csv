12 February 2020,mikialama,7," looking forward to more episodes!
","Despite the fact that Fox has been very obvious about building its cast of 911: Lone Star right out of the diversity Bible, they've put together a kick-butt slate of characters I really look forward to seeing develop. There is so much potential here for some really interesting story line developments! Rob Lowe was the perfect choice as the hip but not too hip 9/11 hero newly moved to the Hill Country to help rebuild a firehouse which lost its entire crew, minus one, in an explosion. Some of his choices are a muslim woman, a latino man, a transgendered man, his own gay son. The dialog is sharp and witty without being too blithe and breezy like some of the fireman hero shows I've seen in the past. And as a Texan who knows all about keeping Austin weird, I enjoy the subtle comparisons between it and the Big Apple. Really excited to see Liv Tyler as an extremely competent paramedic captain and Lower's possible love interest, but the two most exciting cast choices are Brian Michael Smith as the trans fireman and FINALLY, we get to see Jim Parrack back in a regular series (his appearance in the totally misguided October Faction doesn't count). He was always a favorite as Hoyt in True Blood and I'm glad to see him in what looks like a show that is going to be really great. It is still finding its legs, but the show and cast are solid. If the writers keep doing their part, it will be a hit.",/review/rw5446320/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2020,catfanatic888,9," Why the low review scores? A GREAT SHOW
","I don't understand why the IMDb rating is so average to low for this fantastic show. The entire cast is superb including the guest stars and seldom seen characters. The stories are well written and they are exciting and touching, too. I like this show as well as the original 911 but I prefer this one slightly because of the fantastic chemistry between the characters. If you like Chicago Fire or 911, give this show a chance. I think you will be very pleasantly surprised!",/review/rw5446320/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2020,cmeirinhas,10," loved it
","Well i have to disagree with most of the reviews, i loved it and found it refreshing! You people have to forget politics and just watch it carefully. It aproaches a lot of the tabus thas society still has. The focus on PTSD, cancer and the whole views on sexual and cultural of nowadays is awsome. Disregard all comments and see it at least once ;)",/review/rw5446320/?ref_=tt_urv

28 January 2020,Rattrap007,6," Not terrible, not great either
","More 9-1-1 style stories, but also much weaker than the original show. Rob Lowe plays a typical Rob Lowe character. He is very picky about his looks abd has a beauty regiment. The diverse cast is written to be that way. You got a gay son, large black man, Muslim woman, and hispanic guy. The team was assembled to be diverse because of the city's past of good old boy network.",/review/rw5446320/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2020,hah1993,1," 9-1-1: Woke Star
","I am truly for adding diversity into shows, but this one hits you over the head far too much with it. The entire episode definitely felt like a checklist strung together with mediocre acting. If the acting was better, maybe the agenda wouldn't have felt so obvious.",/review/rw5446320/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2021,freddy_at_home,9," Cheesy and over the top show, really fun!
","Rob Lowe, who doesn't like him?! And his great hair, LOL! He is classic in this show. I am so glad we got a season 2. I hope we get more seasons too. I know, it's sometimes very cheesy and sometimes dumb, but it's fun! Get's your mind off things and make you feel good, can't ask for more than that. A lifesaver in this pandemic we are having. I look forward to every episode, making a sandwich and just chill out watching, having fun. Check it out!",/review/rw5446320/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2020,G27489,1," Not worth the time

20 January 2020,estelle58,1," I gave it 20 minutes.
","My Packers lost, oh well, maybe this new show with the ever handsome Rob Lowe will cheer me up. Wrong! The opening scene was pathetically comical, I am not a spoiler type, so enough said. None the less I persevered. Perhaps it will get better. Well 20 minutes in, I could not deal with the silliness anymore. Merely an insult to intelligence.",/review/rw5446320/?ref_=tt_urv

","Lame writing, predictable plot/dialogue. Overdone attempt to appease every subculture under the sun. Tries way too hard to be inclusive at the expense of being genuine.",/review/rw5446320/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2020,KILBOURNE311,3," POLITICAL DUMPSTER FIRE
","So let's see, 1st episode: Gay men, Muslim woman, Trans man, Interracial couple, illegal immigrants scared of the police and can't afford insurance, an opioid situation, a suicide scare, I mean, did they leave anyone out or are the #MeToo folks and a terrible President in the future episodes?? It's really enough to make you want to turn the show OFF! Jesus Christ, calm down with the political correctness Hollywood. This was real hard to watch because they took the joy right the F--- out of it........",/review/rw5446320/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2021,franp1982,10," I don't understand why the low rate...
",I started to watch it with doints for the low score as I am fan of original 911. However I am really enjoying it. These new characters with so much diversity ara amazing. I think poeple should give it a chance because it is a really good show.,/review/rw5446320/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2021,aky13-1,10," Two boxes of tissues needed
","Yes, I am a schmaltzy 74 year old male! This episode was perfect in so many ways. I judge acting by believability .... the entire cast was fully believable! Raw emotions that conveyed to viewers. Awesome special effects. Great writing and story lines!",/review/rw5446320/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2020,jasiegirl,5," Not the greatest start....
","I feel like I have to write a review of 9-1-1: Lonestar because I've been a HUGE fan of the original 9-1-1 since the beginning. I don't think that Lonestar is complete garbage like some users are saying. But with it being a spin-off, I find that I can't help but compare it to the original. Lonestar just doesn't have the same feel and draw like the original. It didn't start off with a bang and suck you in like the original 9-1-1 did. The characters feel stiff and out of place, and don't have the same chemistry as the original 9-1-1 characters. Also, it is very blatantly PC, and I'm getting tired of that being shoved down our throats on TV shows.",/review/rw5446320/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2020,marbishop,9," Lowe love!
","Love this show, yeah it's not believable and it's kind of a joke. But it has a storyline. It's not a comparison to the other one, but normally the OG is the best anyway. I love the cast. It's TV people don't be so critical and sit back and enjoy. You voted for Trump and you think this is a joke. Haha. I'm glad I'm Canadian.",/review/rw5446320/?ref_=tt_urv

","If it weren't bad enough it seems like every channel is politics and it seems like every commercial is politics, we are tired of hearing about it I'm tired of seeing it, just make a good TV show and movie, Hollywood has ruined everything",/review/rw5446320/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2020,khconsteng,1," Another example of Hollywood elite blindness.
","1. Another LGBTQ pushing political agenda.
2. Not enough Austin geography research. Driving to Texas from New York, a driver never sees desert. Footage of new captain driving to Texas has him coming in from the west. Coming from New York, a driver sees lush East Texas forests then, prairies of mesquite and oak tress, then the beauty of the Hill Country.
3. The opening fire is an industrial site that would be miles outside Austin or if within Austin, would be properly marked for fire and explosion hazards. Seems like Hollywood is using West, Texas fire as example but that is 45 minutes outside Austin. Later footage shows trucks responding down streets next to state capital. There are 49 stations in Austin. Unless a huge multiple alarm incident, this firehouse geographic range would not be so vast.",/review/rw5446320/?ref_=tt_urv

",I never watched this show until the episode that followed the Daytona 500. I found the show enjoyable and entertaining. I feel sorry for the neurotic conservative commenters who overthink every issue in a lame attempt to turn it into a divisive political issue.,/review/rw5446320/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2020,lh_lostie,1," Get up get get down, 911's a woke joke in yo town!
","I love Rob Lowe and Liv Tyler and was really looking forward to this show. I tried so hard to watch it, but tapped out in less than 30 minutes. At least Rob Lowe will never get into any legal trouble for not being an equal opportunity employer. I am not sure there are any other tick marks they missed on the job applications. This show is embarrassingly unwatchable. Why does diversity have to trump quality? I watch tv to try to escape politics, but that is now an impossibility.",/review/rw5446320/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2022,barbararush-95830,10," One of the top 10 shows on t.v.
","When I started watching this show, I really didn't like it all that much and didn't finish the first season. For some inexplicable reason, I went back to it when it was in its third season and couldn't help myself; I binge watched the whole thing. It just kept getting better and better. The writing is top-notch and so are all of the actors. Gina Torres is one of my favorite actors and I usually try to watch anything she's in. I appreciate Rob Lowe in every role I've seen him in; he is amazingly versatile and likeable. I have come to develop two new favorites, Jim Parrack and Sierra McClain. These three actors give the show much of its ""heart."" The show has an unbeatable mix of humor, suspense, and pathos. While watching it, I alternately laugh, cry, and bite my nails. That's what t.v. Is supposed to do: entertain -- and this show does so much more. I'm not sure how I can explain the positive effect it has had on me. Thanks to the writers, actors, and everyone else who has put this excellent series together.",/review/rw5446320/?ref_=tt_urv
