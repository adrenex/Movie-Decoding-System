28 June 2018,Jessicat66,9," An emotional rollercoaster for loners of any age
","Though this film fits the coming of age genre the struggles that Nadine, the main character, is going through are not purely 'teen problems', As a 20 something year old this film deeply resonated with me and though similar to Nadine I was a socially awkward, defensive and pessimistic teenager it wasn't just the teenage me who could find the character relatable. I've noticed in the low rated comments one of the main reasons people didn't like the film is because the main character isn't likeable. And though I loved the film, I would agree; she isn't likeable. And the film is more realistic and better off for it. In real life we aren't always likeable people ourselves and the film almost acts as a tool to allow us to step back and really look at our current or teenage selves. Nadine does realise and understand towards the end and throughout the film her erratic and selfish behaviour is a result of her self loathing because she knows she doesn't want to continue being that way but she's stuck in this endless cycle and doesn't know how to get out. The valuable lesson from the film and her journey within it is that we often bring misfortune and unhappiness on ourselves in the way we handle and respond to bad things in our lives.

18 November 2016,ThomasDrufke,8," Fresh, Endearing, and Funny
","I can't say that I expected to see this movie opening weekend, or at all for that matter. But I'm glad I did. The Edge of Seventeen is an awkwardly charming coming of age tale that flirts in the same vein as some classic John Hughes 80's flicks.",/review/rw3753246/?ref_=tt_urv

","Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) loved her father and battled with her mother (Kyra Sedgwick). At 13, she lost her father. Her life is one of miserable sarcasm except for her best friend since second grade, Krista (Haley Lu Richardson). She hates her perfect brother Darian (Blake Jenner). Dorky Erwin Kim has a crush on her but she's in lust with delinquent Nick Mossman. To her horrors, Krista starts dating Darian. The only person she could turn to is equally sarcastic teacher Mr. Bruner (Woody Harrelson).",/review/rw3753246/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2018,diegojosmer,9," So Relatable
","The Edge of Seventeen is a movie I stumbled upon. I did not know what to watch next and saw this movie available to stream. Once I started watching I absolutely fell in love with this movie. It's a coming of age story that could not be more real about the life of a teenager. The movie is awkward, funny, sad, frustrating, and emotional, and that's exactly what being a teenager is. Hailee Steinfeld perfectly plays a character that I've seen has been labeled unlikable. I read other reviews and some just say that ""she is unlikeable and thinks she's way hotter and funnier than she really is."" And that's absolutely right, her character, Nadine spends most of the movie not knowing why she feels so frustrated. She just is. And me being a teenager myself I know that is absolutely accurate. Sometimes I just feel angry because I do, and sometimes I'm really anxious and awkward without wanting to. This is the first movie in which I have really seen myself reflected onscreen. The main character is a teenage girl, but this movie is so greatly written that it isn't only relatable to girls but to all teenagers in general like it happened to me being a guy. The whole arc the character goes through is not about her changing everything about herself, but about recognizing that everyone has problems and everyone feels all of those emotions she feels. The dialogue was perfectly written, it reflected everything about being this age. The performances were amazing, Hailee Steinfeld is a really talented actress.
I was genuinely surprised about how great this movie was. It's such a relatable and heartwarming story that at times may feel a little irritable or all over the place, but that's just what being a teen is.",/review/rw3753246/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2018,katiefanatic-791-306918,8," What 'Lady bird' wanted to be.
","I've spent a lot of time over the years trying to figure out the humor I like and movies like this pin it down for me. I like awkward humor. Nadine is all kinds of awkward and that's what makes her relatable and adorable. You empathize with her and the problems she's going through, and through the eyes of an adult, of course you laugh at how overdramatic she is, but in a FUNNY way. It makes for some comedic relief between her and her teacher delightfully played Woody Harrelson, who just ignores her neuroses. What makes the film a pleasant experience is the way she is played by Hailee Steinfeld. There's a few minutes here and there where they venture into 'I will punch you' category, but nowhere near the insufferable 'lady bird' I had to turn off after ten minutes. Definitely a recommended film for those who empathize with growing pains.",/review/rw3753246/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2016,paul-allaer,7," Watch it for Hailee Steinfeld's performance
","""The Edge of Seventeen"" (2016 release; 104 min.) brings the story of Nadine, a 17 yr. old junior at Lakewood HS. As the movie opens, Nadine is racing the school's hallways to meet with her favorite teacher and tell him ""I'm going to kill myself!"" The movie then goes back in time to see how we get to this point. After a short look at ""Nadine, Age 7"" and ""Nadine, age 13"", where we learn how socially awkward things are for Nadine, but for her strong friendship with her BFF Krista. That brings us to ""Nadine, 17"". At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw3753246/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2017,zkonedog,5," Authentic, But Not Necessarily Always Entertaining
","Much of the positive buzz about ""The Edge of Seventeen"" came from positive comparisons to films like ""The Breakfast Club"" or ""16 Candles"". As I'm always up for movies that describe the emotional state of the teen years (provided they aren't gross-out/sex comedies...I don't care for those all that much), and am a big fan of Hailee Steinfeld, I decided to give this one a try. What I found is that while the film is most certainly authentic (i.e. seems to be true to what teens go through these days), I can't say it was really all that entertaining either. It just lacked that emotional investment towards the characters that one needs to truly fall in love with a film.",/review/rw3753246/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2016,oOoBarracuda,10," The Edge of Seventeen
","Kelly Fremon Craig wrote and directed the 2016 coming-of-age story, The Edge of Seventeen. Starring Hailee Steinfeld, Haley Lu Richardson, and Woody Harrelson, The Edge of Seventeen tells the ever so familiar tale of navigating high school and the awkward teenage years just as your world begins to fall apart. Kelly Fremon Craig follows the formula of a coming-of-age story while still managing to tug at the heartstrings of the audience and keep us engaged through the final scene. Brilliantly written with a wonderful cast, The Edge of Seventeen is sure to gain attention this Oscar season.",/review/rw3753246/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you're on the outside, in a strange way it may be preferable in certain ways than being the ""perfect"" child. I know this from experience - being a teenager sucked, and felt very much alone and alienated and without many (if any) friends, and feeling like everyone around was full of crap and not worth paying attention to - that there is this ironic thing that being someone like Nadine in this story is that it makes that person feel special. This is a revelation that comes late in the movie, but it's something that should've been seen for so long: you now, Nadine, the 'perfect' ones are pretty damn miserable too. Know that and see that. That's a message enough.",/review/rw3753246/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2016,devin-gregory,8," Top Shelf For This Genre
","As a fan of the ""coming of age"" story structure, I am happy to report that this film met my expectations in every single way. Some key plot points were predictable, but the writing, performances and soundtrack were all on point. The emotions and experiences the film conveys do not feel artificial, and Hailee Steinfeld shines! Intelligent writing and little twists here and there will likely leave you genuinely invested in the life of these characters and leave you wanting more. Woody Harrelson plays a wonderful image of a teacher dealing with his life amidst high school drama and Kyra Sedgwick's performance as a struggling mother was especially heart felt and real. This is not to be missed for fans of this genre!",/review/rw3753246/?ref_=tt_urv

","""The Edge of Seventeen"" is really two films. The first half is a sloppy teen comedy with very few laughs. The second half is a syrupy coming of age story that is not believable. Neither the comedy nor the serious drama succeed in their objectives.",/review/rw3753246/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2016,darkojedi,," Recommended
","John Hughes is an unmistakable touchstone of the coming of age 1980s high school dramedy. Films like Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink and Ferris Bueller's Day Off chronicled the adolescent experience of growing up, dealing with teen angst and self-actualization while mixing in a dash of old fashioned screwball comedy which at once provides relatable laughter for the viewer while making the dramatic pills easier to swallow. All of those undeniably come to mind when watching the directorial debut of Post Grad screenwriter Kelly Fremon Craig, The Edge of Seventeen, a coming of age high school comedy about a socially awkward and unhappy teenage girl named Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld from True Grit) whose best friend enters a relationship with her hunky older brother (Blake Jenner from Everybody Wants Some). And yet it is Amy Heckerling's Fast Times at Ridgemont High that The Edge of Seventeen finds its closest antecedent in, providing at once a funny and sympathetic rom com and a decidedly darker, more explicit look at budding female sexuality in a world adorned with dumb horny males who care nothing for the heroine's plight and emotional crossroads. At times its unbearable watching Nadine suffer while at the same time the film doesn't deny her own complicitness in the creation of her teenage misery. At first on the outset this looked like another Juno/Ghost World lovechild but as it progressed I was surprised how funny, charming, touching and well thought out this portrait of adolescent fear, anxiety and depression really was. Sure we've seen this movie done to death, but The Edge of Seventeen provided a fresh spin on the proceedings that kept it from blending together with what came before it.",/review/rw3753246/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2019,kingsx_64,7," Not just teen angst
","As many reviewers have stated, the main character Nadine is more then just going through growing pains. She shows signs of deeper emotional problems that go way beyond losing her father.
Almost all of Nadine's problems are brought on by her own actions. And when one is unaware that they are the problem, it will continue. Unfortunately here, she does a complete 180, over the coarse of a night. I didn't like that. But maybe time constraints prohibited from telling this gradually.
One of the strongest disagreements I've seen in reviews has been over her life long friend. To me this might have been the ONLY thing Nadine was justified at feeling betrayed. Key is lifelong friend. Who we see in one scene is actually targeting her brother. Then in the next she's found in bed with him. Then in the next she's all mushy mushy with a girl who wouldn't talk to her before. So yes Nadine, giving her an ultimatum was probably not the right next move, but never speaking to her again would have been. You just don't do that to friends.
I found Woody to be a great choice in a supporting but important role as a very grounding and level headed teacher.
Hailee Steinfeld's performance once again shows she's a force now, and in the future.
Though the ending was to quick at resolve, it was definitely worth a watch",/review/rw3753246/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2017,deloudelouvain,5," If you're over twenty-five I would just watch something else.
","My wife saw The Edge Of Seventeen and told me it was a chick flick. So I was warned but I still did watch it though. And I can only come to the conclusion that those ose kind of movies are just not for me. I can get that teenagers like those kind of movies, because maybe they can recognize some stuff from their own adolescent life. But for a grown childless man like myself the last thing I want to see is whining adolescents during ninety minutes. Because that's what you basically get with The Edge Of Seventeen. Hailee Steinfeld plays Nadine, a teenager that complains about almost everything while in my humble opinion she has absolutely no reason to. The movie is shot nicely though, the acting is just okay, the script is boring. Boring for almost everybody past twenty-five.",/review/rw3753246/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2016,jon.h.ochiai,10," Love Thine Own Self
","Some of the best comedies distinguish the touching hysterical irony of life's joy and tragedy, and celebrate the very best in people in life's paradox. ""The Edge of Seventeen"" is that and much more. First time Director and Writer Kelly Fremon Craig masterfully navigates that fine line between cleverer than thou, and the reckoning of one's self. Craig captures the natural speak of high school kids without some of the pretense of ""Juno"". ""The Edge of Seventeen"" makes you burst out loud with laughter, and touches your heart. Hailee Steinfeld makes this all possible. What a revelation. I remember Hailee from the Coen Brothers' ""True Grit""— phenomenal. Here she is a star. Steinfeld's performance is funny, vulnerable, and fearless. Hers is one the year's best as well. ",/review/rw3753246/?ref_=tt_urv

","The first 3/4 of the movie are completely enthralling, there's no doubt about that.
