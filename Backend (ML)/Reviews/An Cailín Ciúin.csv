16 August 2014,hughman55,10," It's the time between the seconds...
","I discovered this on Netflix and knew nothing about it when I began watching it. It is a brilliant piece of television. The story is gripping and this caliber of work is very rare. The writing is the best you'll find and the cast is powerful. This is not a chest thumping, triumphant, primal scream of a story. This is a walk through fear, uncertainty, and madness, that is at times almost too painful to watch. But you will watch it. ",/review/rw4574892/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2013,filmchaser,10," 10/10 All the Way
","Well, after the first episode of watching Aden Young embody the character of Daniel Holden, I'm hooked. Daniel Holden was arrested for the rape and murder of his girlfriend at the age of 16, convicted and sent to live on death row at the age of 18, and 20 years later after living on death row in a cell by himself, preparing himself to die and be forever gone from this earth, has survived 5 stays of execution long enough for technology to catch up with forensic science and, unbelievably, Daniel Holden is released to his family because it is determined that his DNA was not found at the scene of the crime. So now the big question is: Will the current prosecutor re-try a 20 year old case? The whole town has an opinion, and while Daniel Holden walks around like a man in his own dream, quietly and painfully processing freedom, relating to a family that is 20 years older, and adjusting to the overwhelming overload of his sensory perceptions, danger is lurking as those involved in the original case begin to realize what is at risk if a new trial takes place. It's too soon for all of us, the audience, to know what is at risk because, wisely, the story is unfolding slowly and painstakingly like a new flower. The actors are all superb as they falter and try to think of how to talk to Daniel. Daniel is unsure, awkward, and quiet...very, very quiet. Aden Young's face can show about 5 emotions all at the same time, and in one scene as he is describing in a perfect soft, southern drawl his prison ""initiation"" experience for his shallow step-brother, Teddy, Daniel's expression changed from placid, to subdued, to quietly earnest, to a moment of sheer madness, before he snapped back to placid, leaving Teddy speechless and a little bit afraid. Totally alone and silent, this tall man with the haunted eyes drew me in as he walked to a baseball field and just laid down in the grass. How can such a gentle person be guilty of such a heinous crime? Who committed this crime and let this sweet soul suffer 24/7 for 20 years waiting to die, stealing his youth? Is this man guilty, innocent, reformed, or just a stone cold killer with a good con going? I don't know yet. So I will stay tuned.",/review/rw4574892/?ref_=tt_urv

21 April 2013,larajane,," Excellent, thoughtful drama
","I've watched the first two episodes after being tempted by a promo prefaced by 'from the producers of Breaking Bad'. Reading reviews about its slow pace put me off slightly, but I went ahead with the first episode and was hooked about 15 minutes in by the writing, the excellent use of silences and the sheer quality of the performances. Aden Young is mesmerising, his thousand yard stare bringing nuance to every scene he is in, and he is ably supported by a cast I know from nowhere else, with the exception of Adelaide Clemens. The pace is slow, but not in a frustrating way - it seems entirely appropriate to let the audience experience the bewildering, overwhelming experience of being free after two decades on Death Row, and while after two episodes, I am no wiser as to Daniel's innocence, I do find that I genuinely care about it, and that's pretty much the most important thing to me in any drama: I should care about the people (like them, hate them) otherwise I'm just watching moving images. Having said that, the moving images are pretty compelling also - the use of light and the photography are evocative, as is the atmosphere of the small, southern town and the sometimes claustrophobic interiors. Genuinely impressive TV-making; I'm pleased to know there's more to come.",/review/rw4574892/?ref_=tt_urv

22 May 2013,sridhar-e,10," A classy affair
",In recent times TV channels have been spewing out shows after shows but without any class. Sundance has come up with Rectify which defies all the current trends. Rectify is not a show which is recommended for people who like fast paced storyline and actions. Rectify has a slow narration. It allows room for the characters to feel the feelings and act without saying words. The direction is beautiful. you almost feel like its a work of art. The background music is the life of the show. It has been beautifully crafted to capture and express every emotion the lead is feeling. Some of the dialogues feel straight out of a novel. Rectify is TV at its best. I am really glad to have taken the time out to watch the entire first season. I hope the second season doesn't commercialize and dilute the offering of the show.,/review/rw4574892/?ref_=tt_urv

","While the premise and synopsis of the show hint onto crime/docudrama/true crime thing, that's only a really small part of it. If I had to define Rectify with one word or trait, it would be it's humanity. It's a four season long dissection of a human condition, sometimes dour, sometimes magical.",/review/rw4574892/?ref_=tt_urv

4 July 2019,The_late_Buddy_Ryan,9," ""Not gallows humor, but lethal-injection humor--more humane, but less funny.""
","We caught a few episodes when this amazing series was still on non-premium cable, but it's much easier to stay with it now on Netflix, stripped of roughly 15 minutes of ads/ep. (When somebody at the NY Times put it on a list of the 20 best TV shows of this century, we finally gave it another shot.) I'd classify it as Southern gothic suspense, though ""suspense"" may not seem like the word for a series that, like its protagonist, is as painstaking and thoughtful as this one. Daniel Holden is a Georgia man approaching forty who's just been released on appeal after nineteen years on death row. Those years have made him a bit of a Stoic philosopher; his speech is measured, ironic, sometimes cryptic--his jealous stepbrother, Teddy, calls him ""Starman,"" which is not meant kindly, but seems pretty accurate.",/review/rw4574892/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2016,jimgigs,10," Great story
","Just binge watched all 30 episodes of this great series and can't believe how few people I know have ever even heard of it. This was excellent TV. The acting was some of the best I've ever come across in a series. The writing, my god, what a story. The show is a real character study. If your looking for gratuitous sex and violence, watch sons of anarchy, this show isn't for you. If you're looking for a real character driven drama,that makes you really think and feel real emotions this is the show for you. It's the closest thing to reading a book I've ever encountered on the screen. No dialogue is wasted, and often times it's what the characters aren't saying. The awkward silences that say more than the actual spoken words. The cinematography is excellent as well, each episode filled with great shot after great shot. The casting was phenomenal, set in the south I didn't catch a hint of a phony or overstated southern accent, I wouldn't be surprised if most of the cast really is from the south. Highly recommend this smart watch to anyone that likes a good story.",/review/rw4574892/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2013,kristopherm3,10," A fantastic TV Drama that needs to be watched
","This, whilst produced by the same people who produced Breaking Bad, doesn't have tense, action and the characters aren't under constant threat. Rectify is more of a character-study than a deep narrative, there isn't a giant mystery or conflict it strives to describe a much more personal experience of the protagonist, and does so wonderfully. It is about how one man deals with life outside of prison walls after serving 19 years within them, he is released with no smooth transition and is literally thrown into a world he doesn't understand. Rectify is about a man who has been left stuck in the past when the world has changed so much without him. The production values, writing and cinematography are all on par with Breaking Bad's extremely high standards.",/review/rw4574892/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2021,blueoysterdvp,10," Outstanding!
","Sometimes you never know what you're going to get when you start streaming a series. I've watched highly rated ones that I couldn't take any more of after only 2 episodes. A few with low 7 ratings I thought got a way too low feedback number. ""Rectify"" grabbed me in episode 1 and the binge began. What a great and sensitive topic with swirling sub plots. I thought the acting was great and the ending a perfect 10. The only spoiler I'll leave here is that the violence in the first season tapers down. Some flash backs here and there but ""Rectify"" turns into a smart drama with some well thought out scenes.",/review/rw4574892/?ref_=tt_urv

8 July 2017,gfindley,10," Perhaps the most achingly beautiful show on TV ever
","It's hard to fathom how this show ended so soon when we still have inane reality shows going into their 10th season, but it is probably more a link to what much of television's audience has grown used to. This show, from beginning to end, was nothing short of brilliant. The cast was perfect. Aden Young made my heart break every time he was on screen without even saying one word.I should have prefaced this with the understanding that I watch little TV. I just can't tolerate most of it. I came across this show by accident one evening and I was immediately mesmerized. The depth of the characters is so profound, one could drown in the anguish and longing they evince. I did not feel I was watching a television show so much as watching unfold a profoundly moving and heartbreaking journey of an innocent man, a wrongful conviction, and the torment of a family. I have never felt so bereft that it came to an end after such a short run, but it is, after all, a commentary on what so many have come to expect from ""entertainment."" How unspeakably sad.",/review/rw4574892/?ref_=tt_urv
