4 August 2004,=G=,8," Entertainment on steroids
","The hugely popular ""CSI"" is no less than a contemporary entertainment marvel. Finding its stride in season 2 with a formula which pushes the envelope while still being doable, this series packs ample portions of entertainment into 40 minute episodes while staying fresh, delivering palatable doses of science didactically, and, most of all, manifesting a strong sense of social responsibility in all of its subliminals. While most entertainment aims for the crotch, the gut, or the heart, ""CSI"" goes for the most difficult target, the head, as it teaches forensics and the empirical process while remaining cooly detached from sensationalism and melodrama all the while using the ""truth is stranger (and more interesting) than fiction"" thesis to its and our advantage. The results are fun and interesting lessons in everything from dwarfism to Down syndrome to anatomy to ballistics to etc. all the while maintaining a social conscience. Whether explaining how S&M is not necessarily perversion to simply dissing Don King, ""CSI"" is one sweet sugar coated education with solid mainstream values. My favorite lines? CSI1:""There's a sucker born every minute.""  CSI2: ""Yeah. And they all come to Vegas.""  Truer words....",/review/rw2330276/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2002,supertom-3,," Must see TV!!
","CSI has come to the UK and has been on our screens for around a year. I saw the first episode and was impressed but like with a lot of TV series I found good such as the X-files I just forgot about it and never watched it, anyway about 2 months ago I heard and advert on the radio for it and so watched it. I have been watching it religously since, I have missed most of series one and the first few episodes of series two which annoys me but every episode is great, well written and excellently acted and directed. What sets this out from other TV shows is the incredibly professional look, from the movie like cinematography to the brilliant acting, the writing is always very good and the plot twists always surprising whilst feasible. I wish I had watched it since series one. I am a fan of Marg Helgenberger, I find her very sexy, she is a gorgeous woman and this really made me finally decide to watch it, as I usually watch something from the movie channels on saturdays. The show has a great production value and its got that Bruckheimer class about it. They always have good directors such as Danny Cannon who also did the underrated Stallone flick Judge Dredd. All the actors are good the two younger guys played by Gary Dourdon and George Eads and the nice looking Joja Fox and they and Marg are all led by the ultra intelligent Gill Grissom, excellently played by the one of the shows producers William Peterson, the lines Grissom has are classic. The show has some generally interesting characters who are all likeable. This show is pure TV excellence and it gets a bonus thumbs up because they cast one of my fave actors Mark Dacascos in an episode which should reach the UK in about 7 weeks. 10/10",/review/rw2330276/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2002,stamper,," Original and entertaining
","CSI is one of the best TV series of the last few years (with Law and Order: Special Victims unit and That 70's show). Not only is it original and exciting, but the acting is top shelf as well. The producers and the people from casting, most famously represented by Jerry Bruckheimer, really did a great job in bringing together a perfect team of actors. The two most famous to me were Marg Helgenberger (Catherine Willows) and Paul Guilfoyle (Jim Brass) who have had a couple of minor roles in some films I saw. The rest of the crew are William L.Petersen (Gil Grissom), Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle), Gary Dourdan (Warrick Brown) and George Earls (Nick Stokes)",/review/rw2330276/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,8," A great show, but not as good as it used to be
","I love these kinds of shows, so I came across CSI:Crime Scene Inestigation by accident while flicking through channels, and since that moment I have been hooked. I like how each crime is looked at from a different perspective, it offers a whole new slant on things, although some of the more disturbing/graphic images may turn your stomach a little. Also, I love the colours the series is shot in, reds, blues, greens and yellow, really a treat to the eye, and the photography is very impressive. And the music is funky and cool, well the theme song is from The Who, they ooze with coolness. I like the writing, Grissom's dialogue and asides are a joy to behold especially, and the methodical but well structured story lines. The season finales nearly always manage to be gripping and compelling. And the acting is great, William Peterson was wonderful as Grissom, and although I was sad to see him go, the character's departure was handled very well so I was glad of that. The reason why it isn't quite as good as it could have been is because somehow I don't find it as well thought out as the earlier seasons. And while Laurence Fishburne is a great actor and does a good job, I kind of miss Grissom if you get the jist. That said though, this is a great show. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2330276/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2000,AlabamaWorley1971,," Just terrific!
","I've always been fascinated by forensic science, so this was tailor-made for me! It's intelligent and literate, with intriguing stories and lots of cool crime-fighting toys. If you liked MANHUNTER (1986), which also starred William Petersen, you'll enjoy this. High quality TV.",/review/rw2330276/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2002,Old Joe,," Crime-busting has not been this intriguing in years!
","I am not sure whether TV accurately shows us real life professions or not. One thing I do know, is that when I find a good TV series, I stick with it. I have done precisely that with CSI, although it has taken its time to grow on me. However once it did, I cannot miss a minute of it. Considering that Australian TV has had many 'crime' based TV shows in the past and the present, it is refreshing to watch an American spin on the Â‘crime' theme. CSI is now a weekly viewing ritual that I could not imagine being without.",/review/rw2330276/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2002,SMLA11,," Brilliant
",C.S.I: Crime Scene Investigation is a truly brilliant show that follows a bunch of investigators of murders who find out how the death happened and possibly find out who did it.  The show is excellent on many levels.  The characters are very cool and well-developed.  The storylines are brilliant. Almost every story is perfect and imaginative.  I love this show.,/review/rw2330276/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2000,millennia-2,," What's happened to CBS?
","In the past few months, the world has witnessed a dramatic transformation. Well... maybe not very dramatic, or even much of a transformation either, but it's still an event that rarely happens in the world of entertainment. Just a couple short months ago, CBS, then by far the least threatening and underachieving of the four major networks (NBC, Fox, and ABC being the others), was in the midst of a slow but steady decline, with no major shows outside 'Nash Bridges' and the ancient '60 Minutes'. Since then, there was the mega hit 'Survivor', and now they've pumped up their Friday line-up with an update of 'The Fugitive', and 'C.S.I', an exceptional one hour drama, along the lines of 'Law & Order: SVU'.",/review/rw2330276/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2001,daumas,," ONE OF THE BEST SERIES I'VE EVER SEEN
","Takes another another angle of vision for cops and crime series. Everything is perfect: the choose of the cast, the cast themselves, the stories, etc. Although some can think of gore scenes, the episodes are not so violent as the similar we have usually. A suggestion: it should be a good idea to start to show some aspects of the their personal lives.",/review/rw2330276/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2000,kidcurry1967,," Outstanding!!!
","C.S.I. is the best new show of the 2000 season!  William L. Petersen is the coolest of the cool as Gil Grissom.  I've followed his career since I first saw him in To Live and Die in L.A.  He's an amazing actor and he heads up a cast of amazing actors as well.  This show really keeps you on the edge of your seat as the investigators literally take a crime scene that appears to leave them with nothing to go on.  The investigators take nothing and turn it into something amazing as each crime is solved right in front of you and you as the viewer, never see it coming!  Wow!  I hope this is one show CBS will pick up year after year!",/review/rw2330276/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2016,ma-cortes,7," Overlong series with several sequels and spins-off , about an expert team working extremely their hard investigations
","This show by creator Anthony E. Zuiker describes the hard-working assignments carried out by the Las Vegas Police Department Crime Scene Investigations bureau , in the city of Las Vegas, Nevada . Being the second busiest crime lab in America , CSI investigators use the best scientific and technical methods to resolve enigmas and detain delinquents , utilizing complex analysis and the occasional leap in logic . Led by hard-nosed Captain Jim Brass (Paul Guilfoyle) and by Grissom (William Petersen , being subsequently replaced by Ted Danson and Larry Fishburne) , as his second in command , who while attached mainly to their works , they do make friendly connections with his staff . And at least one friend is willing to relocate entirely to work with quirky Grissom , Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) . With an extreme dedication towards their quest for the true facts , he and his elite team of investigators work several twisted cases using scientific skills and equipment that are capable of finding valuable tracks from the most allegedly unlikely sources .",/review/rw2330276/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2011,Kaptain_Bluddflagg,3," A nice trip to the land of make believe
","The main reason I dislike this show is how inaccurate it is; CSI techs are not cops. They can't arrest people, can't serve warrants, don't interrogate suspects and lab results take MUCH longer then they do on the show. ",/review/rw2330276/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2009,Dark_liquid,5," Watchable, yet too plastic
","I believe that the thing i hate mostly about criminal series is the...perfection. They always solve the cases in that steady rhythm, just like a well trained music band. So nice, so easy, so sci-fi at moments, with everybody doing their job brilliantly, with the help of their uber cool technical equipment; almost iritant. It is somewhat enjoyable, i suppose because of the use of excellent cinematic techniques, but i can never get excited watching it. I can't get in touch with the victim, i can't feel what the killer felt, i can't get upset when some supposedly important twist happens. I'm never surprised. Alright, i know i'm asking for too much out of an hour long episode, but even in such case, i don't think it's impossible do make that level of quality investigation drama happen. In CSI, it just feels like it's all about the looks; the show looks good and it's estheticaly very pleasant, but wait a minute, what about the story?",/review/rw2330276/?ref_=tt_urv

7 October 2000,BlackJAC,," Spectacular!
","I love it!  I took a course on forensic chemistry in college and found it to be a whole lot of fun, and this show just took me back.  In addition to seeing all the cool ways the crime scene unit can place you at the scene and ultimately prove you did the crime, it has gallows humor/sarcasm and edge. I hope they don't cancel it.",/review/rw2330276/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2020,darrenrusk,8," Stop After Grissom Leaves
","The first 8 1/2 seasons of CSI were great. I watched almost every episode, including its Friday beginnings. I was so happy when the show moved to Thursday and became a massive hit. However, after original star William Petersen (Gil Grissom) left midway through Season 9, the show fell apart IMO. I watched until Season 11, and when Fishburne left, I gave up. Anyway, watch Seasons 1-9 for the best quality.",/review/rw2330276/?ref_=tt_urv

","I gave the show another try and it's almost a totally different show. Instead of having three or four investigations in each show, they focus on one main investigation and maybe a minor side.

","I used to like ""CSI Las Vegas""... used to like i it a lot. Back in 2001. when I saw the first episodes, it was a refreshing TV substance, beside the fact it was based on crime and murder, which I am not a great fan of. Unlike the classic detective series which by the late 90s have become boring as hell with all too predictable plots, CSI brought a fresh insight and opened a new window into TV crime. Although it was only slightly based on science and criminal forensics, CSI was a fun thing to watch... it was indeed.",/review/rw2330276/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's official: I AM LOVING THIS SHOW. :)) OMG, there is something about Grissom and Sara that is undeniable. And William Petersen's portrayal of Grissom is the best I have ever seen. He is totally in love with Sara. He just doesn't want to risk his career and everthing he has worked for. The entire cast is awesome as well. Helgenberger and Warrick knock it out of the park too. NOTE TO WRITERS: Please let either Sara or Grissom express their feelings for each other. Then, they can choose to go with it or not. Keep the twisted crimes coming too.

27 October 2010,Carsten_Stenzel,1," So cold and so phony
","Why are these three shows still on the air? Why are they still producing them. I know, many people like them and that might be enough for the producers to do one season after another. But, since this is a great place to post my comments and thoughts...well, let me do so. I cannot stand any of those three shows. Those cops have such a snobbish attitude. They are sitting on their high horses and judge any criminal with their superior attitude. The show is way to high tech, lacks humor and for the most part is (like all three of them) badly casted. Come on, does any of you believe that girl, this great looking, would choose a career in law enforcement??? I know, it's Hollywood, and this probably fits for any given show, but what it all comes down for me is, that CSI (Miami and NY of course too), is way to phony, superficial and absolute without any ""easy going"". I prefer a little humor now and then.",/review/rw2330276/?ref_=tt_urv
