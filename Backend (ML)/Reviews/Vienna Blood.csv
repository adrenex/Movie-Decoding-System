18 December 2020,gogoschka-1,," Why Couldn't They Just Start At The Beginning?
",I just can't for the life of me understand why they thought it was a good idea to start the story in medias res and tell it via flashbacks. I very rarely review shows/films I didn't like (it's just not interesting to me) but this unnecessary approach to one of my favorite stories irks me so much I just have to get the frustration out of my system - so please excuse me for ranting.,/review/rw7572386/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2021,jburtonprod-802-759029,1," Inferior in Every Way to Mick Garris' 1994 Version.
","I was very excited to watch this miniseries. It should've been a slam dunk. All they had to do was cast the movie, properly, upgrade it with up to date special effects and you'd have a triumph deluxe. The story portion was already done for them.",/review/rw7572386/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2021,betchaareoffendedeasily,," Had High Hopes, It Is a a Truly Missed Opportunity.
","Unlike others who have seen the 1994 version and read the book, I do not completely hate this version, although it is quite mediocre for several reasons, it does have a few merits. I suppose this serves as a decent introductory for the book, but despite it's upgraded production values, it falls short of the 1994 min-series, and doesn't cover much ground the 1994 series does, despite a 4hr longer length, which is just bizarre. I also want to note that people always like to say, who have not read the book, ""Your opinion doesn't matter because you read the book, shut up"", and vice versa, can we not take a different approach? I think if a movie or series is based on a book, it must please both those who don't know the book, and those who do, or why adapt a work at all?",/review/rw7572386/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2021,SnoopyStyle,5," new Stephen King adaptation
","It's a nine part TV adaptation of the Stephen King novel of good versus evil. It's not any better than the 1994 version. More money may have been spent but it's not better. The structure is more disjointed which leaves the characters less compelling. I don't like Whoopi Goldberg in this role. The last episode feels stretched out which leaves it without tension. After the climax, the series needs to end. It's an unnecessary update of this material. If it needs doing, it needs some better imagination to bring new life to the story.",/review/rw7572386/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2021,Rob_Taylor,6," What the Hell was the last episode?
","It's been many years since I read The Stand but much of the story remained in my head, mostly because King focused on the characters (as he always does) so intently. As a result, their stories, and character growth were pivotal to the plot development and their actions were the result of that growth.",/review/rw7572386/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2021,olovsimonsson,3," Completely unnecessary
","I don't like making comparisons, but I can't help it in this instance. The 1994 miniseries had it's flaws, but at least it stuck to the main themes of the book; the human beings as pawns in a game of good and evil, who they are and become. Only one episode left of the 2020 version and I feel nothing for any of the characters, simply because I don't know them.",/review/rw7572386/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hideous adaptation of Stephen King's sprawling novel stupidly breaks up the narrative into flashbacks and flash forwards, thus destroying any dramatic tension that might have existed.

21 March 2021,shanayneigh,1," Don't bother
","I really like the book. I've read it at least three times, the last time as late as in the fall of 2018, before I heard anything about a remake being produced. The Mick Garris mini series from 1994 was by no means a masterpiece, but it is vastly superior to this dreck.

22 February 2021,Wrapper30,3," A Horribly Confused mess

15 February 2021,con_au,1," Torture
","Haven't seen the previous version, haven't read the book so at least I can't criticise this absolute shambles compared to them.
As a stand-alone (pun intended) piece though, it's hard to imagine how this could be worse. It would have been smart to stop watching but it's a proper car-crash so it was hard to look away. It took me weeks to watch it though - it's impossible to binge without becoming stupider.
The plot is so nonsensical that I have to presume that some important arcs have either been left out or terribly damaged. When the plot isn't breaking your brain, the over-blown performances (I'm looking at you, Skarsgard) send everything spiralling into farce.
Of course, it's entirely possible, with a deft hand, to bring together farce, drama, comedy, pathos and deliver well-formed entertainment. The Stand does not do that. It lurches around, building zero tension or character development, and occasionally has an explosion of sets or bodies that look like they were executed by the work experience team.
The final episode in particular is a relentless, irredeemable mess that just becomes (unconvincingly) preachy.
I hope that everyone involved at least got to pay their rent for a while, because there's pretty much no other reason for them to be happy about their participation.

15 February 2021,LordJiggy,2," Creatively lazy and staggeringly stupid
","Considering they had, what, a 1000 or so pages to choose from, at almost every juncture the ""typists"" (one can't call them ""creators"") choose the laziest, most obvious way to go. Sure, it's on a cable-lite channel, so they had to tone down the twisted sex and violence, but how could you screw up simple basics like Randall Flagg's supernatural powers, his terrifying presence? How could you make Stu Redman a supporting character? And for the character of Harold Lauter, they might as well have hung a sign around his neck saying ""Psycho Weirdo, Do Not Trust."" And Trashcan Man...well, you get the idea.
What about Nick Andros and his supernatural connections to other characters.",/review/rw7572386/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2021,fromTull,5," Read before you watch! Then you'll get it.
","There's a lot wrong here. Miscasting, burning the candle (or story) at both ends, where I assume we'll meet in some sticky middle ground with the characters well briefed even if the viewers are robbed of the momentum that would have built from the novels original structure. It's a journey. A horrific line to walk and SK planned it perfectly. There's a reason Dorothy and Toto didn't have cabs on the Yellow Brick Road. Some of us WANT to see the flying monkeys. FOR INSTANCE:
I miss Larry's escape from NY by way of a corpse infested tunnel.
I miss the sheriff who saved Nick and allowed him to become jail warden as he grew too ill for the job. And the gentle insight given as Nick took care of and fed his assailants through the bars of their prison cells, and comforted his torturers as they died.
I miss Nadines hallmark red hair. It screamed for hundreds of pages. Until it didn't.
Hemingford Home was in Nebraska, but-snip snip! Colorado it is.
We were in the CDC for many days. Many days. Begging for info on many neighbors. Those names aren't here, and the neighborhood didn't burn away with fever in this version. THAT community of Stu's didn't ever exist in this show.
. . .And the MISCASTING X 10 (take your pick).
So much atmosphere from the novel excised, the leftover scenes flicker by so swiftly you realize they bit off more than they could chew in the hours allotted. Stuff it as much as you want, and maybe the characters will finally develop by the time the final battle rolls around. But. . . Judging by the time jumps, THESE characters are static compared to their novel counterparts. I can't even tell they've been on a journey. Oh that's right.
There's safety in numbers and the series grouped everyone together hyper fast. Going the path solo in the black night was where I felt my palms sweat. Not in a sunlit room with 20 friends. That part DOES COME, but later. I only wish it didn't cost us each characters solo journey to that bright room. Nighttime in a dead world where you're alone and clueless makes for a terrifying journey. But our guys found an ""alternate route"" it seems (I say this as more and more is added weekly, but it's nothing compared to the lacking atmosphere).
The book was a death march. We chose our paths and the stakes climbed with the days, while the nights were filled with horrifying and strange noises. An anxiety attack on a roller coaster with a courtesy espresso before the ride hit its stride.
This series, however, is a drowsy stroll. Like waking from a car nap, you orientate yourself and see how far you've come, and then decide if you should care about where you're at or just black out again. Many separate and small altercations aren't nearly as intimidating as a dreadful marathon filled with a variety of unpredictable dangers. All tension evaporates each time the show flashes forward (or backwards). The tension bottoms out because we are provided relief at the worst time. Horror fans being given thoughtful intermissions (for the delicate viewer out there). It feels like that anyway. And it also renders this risky journey moot. When you see our guys at The Free Zone you don't fear for them in the flashbacks. You KNOW they made it safe and sound. Leaving The Past neutered and without teeth.
If you skip the book even though you enjoyed the series you are doing yourself a disservice. If you read ""The Stand"" and ""'Salem's Lot"", you'll either be addicted, or once again showing your face at church on Sundays.
AND FOR NON READERS of the book who feel they have the right to call long time fans whiny and our viewpoints invalid, you should just keep those opinions to yourselves.
If a man could watch just ONE film during his life: ""Battlefied Earth"", or ""Alien"", but chose ""Battlefied Earth"". That's the predicament I see in these reviews.
OF COURSE these ""non-book"" folks think the series is great.
They have NO idea of what they're missing.",/review/rw7572386/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm about 1/2 hour into the 1st episode, and I can't imagine how anyone who hasn't seen the earlier film or read the book can follow the story. I was so confused by the opening scene (the events actually take place smack in the middle of the story) that I twice paused to make sure I was actually starting at the beginning of the series. The storytelling approach of constant flash backs and forwards destroys the horror and dread of the story and makes understanding the many characters and their place within the story almost impossible. Character development? It may be here, but where and how it's rendered I have no idea.",/review/rw7572386/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2021,fatfil-414-451797,5," SHould have been Great, But Badly Directed/edited.
","Looking through the majority of reviews on here, it seems fairly unanimous that the flashback, time skipping used in this is not popular. I have said before, all of Stephens King's stories are so good because of his building of characters and plot lines, which is lost in all the time jumps. One of the stand out memories from the book was Larry Underwood's back story, which is completely left out. In fact the first mention of him being a pop star is in the final episode, and he is one of the major characters! I have rated it 5/10 because what they gave us was good as far as it went, but only half the story. Why make such a big production and not tell the whole story, should have made it 12 episodes at least.",/review/rw7572386/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2021,KOOLAIDBRO,1," 9 hours of pure boredom
","Good vs. EVIL in an apocalyptic world with a person burning down or blowing up everything in his path should be entertaining. Welp they took this story and made nine hours of pure boredom. This was the first time ever that reading a phenomenal book helped with a trash adaptation of it because they give little to no back story at all on most of the major characters. Why is Lloyd famous? Why does the Trashcan Man matter? I could do this with almost all of the characters. The acting is actually really good, but what they did with it is unbelievable. The character changes from the book to show made no difference to me. In fact Larry Underwood was my favorite character in the book and he was again in the show. In fact he was one of the only ones that is likeable in the show. I'm rambling on and on. Look don't watch this. If you enjoyed this I don't know what to say? It felt like one of the old syfy series from back in the day with no budget. You're probably saying why did you finish it? Welp I'll tell you why. I kept thinking well maybe when it shows their journey to Boulder it will get better? It did not. Then I thought well maybe when the Trashcan Man shows up it will get better? Again Nah.... The writers and directors should be ashamed and I've etched all of their names into my brain to know to be wary of anything with their name attached to it in the future.",/review/rw7572386/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2021,koofasa,2," The stars are for Stephen King, not CBS
","Stephen King wrote an important book more than 40 years ago. Hollywood did a decent job adapting the story in 1994 before Hollywood morphed into an industry devoid of creativity.. Today, they are simply incapable of even adapting a good story because they insist on ruining every script by inserting their opinions on the world. Apparently actors are so desperate for work, they will do anything for money including making fools of themselves. It's embarrassing and cringe-worthy so I can't do it for long. The biggest contradiction in this 'version' of The Stand is that they chose the nastiest, most caustic woman to play a beloved person Mother Abigail. Why would they choose someone who hasn't smiled for more than 20 years to play that role? Sure, I loved Whoopi last century when she was a normal well balanced person but today she is clearly a woman in desperate need of some kind of pleasure. Sadly, the woman who played Oda Mae Brown, Guinan, and the nun in Sister Act died last century.",/review/rw7572386/?ref_=tt_urv
