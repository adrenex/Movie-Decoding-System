","In Atlanta, Dave Lockwood (Jason Bateman) is an efficient and dedicated lawyer that expects to be promoted to partner of the law firm where he has been working for ten years after a merging operation and a family man, married with the gorgeous Jamie Lockwood (Leslie Mann) and father of three children. His best friend is the aspirant actor Mitch Planko (Ryan Reynolds), who is single, reckless and unemployed, and a quitter that never concludes what he is doing.",/review/rw2494818/?ref_=tt_urv

19 August 2011,FanPerspective,," The Change-Up is crude, vulgar and absolutely hilarious!
","Without even seeing it, some people have bashed this film because of it's unoriginal concept. That's true. It has been done before. You can think of it as Freaky Friday... except with dudes and really amped up! From the first few minutes the movie was crude and vulgar... and absolutely hilarious! But what else is to be expected when two mega forces in comedy come together? David Dobkin, the director of Wedding Crashers, and Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, the writers of The Hangover... just an awesome combination that really paid off on screen! Of course, I can't forget to mention the incredibly funny cast that worked so well together: Ryan Reynolds, Jason Bateman, Leslie Mann and Olivia Wilde... even Alan Arkin is in there! The writing is funny, but the comedic timing and performances were just so perfect and what truly made the film hilarious! The story focuses on two childhood pals, Mitch (Reynolds), who dropped out of high school to become an actor and is just a promiscuous mess, and Dave (Bateman), who has worked hard all his life to be a successful lawyer, has a wonderful family and is close to making partner at his firm. One night, though, while going out and catching up after being vacant from one another's lives for a brief time, they get to talking about their lives and drunkenly wish they could take a walk in the other's shoes, but be careful what you wish for when you are pissing in a magic fountain... The next morning the two awake to discover that they have switched bodies. And, although, after freaking out they begin to explore this new freedom, they soon learn that the escape from their normal lives isn't as glorious as they had imagined and begin looking for a way to return to their rightful bodies.",/review/rw2494818/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2011,gtfo-78-427994,10," Why hate?
",Out of all the reviews I read it seems that no one enjoys a good R rated comedy anymore. What happened to the days when everyone kept it simple. This movie made me laugh a lot from start to end. There was a lot of harsh language in this movie BUT! it was done very well. So many funny parts in the movie. I did not find myself bored at anytime in this film. I watched this movie in the hopes to enjoy myself and laugh till my sides hurt and it did just that. One of the better R rated profane comedies I've seen in the last few years. So many comedies have came out rated PG-13 the last few years and many of them was just plain dull.,/review/rw2494818/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2012,larann,7," So funny I was really surprised!
","This movie is not your typical change bodies movie. Justin Bateman & Ryan Reynolds were hilarious & you could tell they had fun making the movie. The language & nudity fit the R rating,but this added to the movie. Definitely adult theme & a little over the top,but I did enjoy this. Olivia Wilde was great and also was Leslie Mann. The baby twins of Justin Bateman were really funny & the scenes were a total surprise. Worth renting, will make you laugh out loud & like the characters. The movie did drag a little in the middle,but did make up for it with the gags. I really like the chemistry of Justin Bateman & Ryan Reynolds. Justin Bateman is so subtle in his comedy.",/review/rw2494818/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2011,cosmo_tiger,," An amazingly hilarious R rated comedy that men and women will love. Haven't laughed this hard in a long time. Must see. I say A
","""Growing up we both had dreams. Dave wanted to be an astronaut, I wanted to sell dolphins on the black market. But found thats hard to do. We live in Atlanta... dolphins are hard to find..."" When single Mitch (Reynolds) and married with children Dave (Bateman) go out they begin talking about each others lives. Both feel like the other one has a better life, then they take a pee. When they wake up the fun begins. Going in I was hoping for a few laughs, mainly because I think the two actors are hilarious. The first half hour was hard to watch, because I was laughing so hard my side hurt and I was crying. Not since ""Wedding Crashers"" was I blown away by the comedy that I was not expecting. By that I mean not only the extreme shocking moments, but the timing between the two and the dialog was so funny that I haven't had this much fun watching a movie in a long time. The only bad thing I have to say about this movie is that it started off on a full run but turned a little more sappy at the end. On the flip side, that part balanced out the rest of it just enough to give your cheeks and side a break. This is a definite R rated comedy that men and women will both love. That is hard to do. I loved it a lot. Overall, next to ""Hall Pass"" the funniest movie I have seen since ""Wedding Crashers"". This movie will not disappoint. I give it an A.",/review/rw2494818/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2011,Movie_Muse_Reviews,5," Never totally escapes the predictability, but does a decent job skirting it
","Oh, the body-swap comedy. You know how it starts, you know how it ends and frankly, you know most of what's in between. To name an R-rated buddy version of this formula ""The Change-Up"" is essentially serving up a thick slice of irony, yet somehow ""The Hangover"" writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore and ""Wedding Crashers"" director David Dobkin manage to change just enough to prevent predictability from drowning their film entirely.",/review/rw2494818/?ref_=tt_urv

5 October 2011,moviexclusive,," A hilariously zippy ride that offers big laughs
","Body-swapping comedies are so 80s. But with The Change-Up, David Dobkin, director of the bloke hit The Wedding Crashers, puts a ribald spin to the genre. Those who can't stand scatological jokes and profanity ought to steer clear. Unless you're a Judd Apatow fan. Although in this movie, you should expect much less emotional poignancy.",/review/rw2494818/?ref_=tt_urv

7 November 2014,americangirlinuk,10," really funny
","Love this movie! Just wanted to say to the people writing reviews, his name is Jason Bateman, not Justin!! Really?? Buy it, you'll love it. Jason and Ryan are great and work together so well. I haven't seen the theatrical version, just the unrated so can't compare, but loved it. There is a lot of potty mouth in this movie, but I think it added to the hilarity and wouldn't have been the same without it, but may offend some I suppose. I'm so not easily offended so I was crackin up. I've never left a movie review before, but the people leaving a review without getting the main actors name right really irritated me. If you are going to take the time to write a review and give credit to a talented actor at least get the name right. How offensive to get Jason's name wrong!",/review/rw2494818/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2011,Smells_Like_Cheese,2," I don't know how this movie is holding a 6.0 + on IMDb
","Two big stars today: Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds, putting them together in a film would be natural for a box office success, even a good movie as they are both decent actors. Even an overused plot of ""let's exchange bodies and find out what your life is like"", been done to death but why not try it with something that has been discussed a million times where why single people want to be married and why married people want to be single again. Now it's not like we haven't all asked this question, I mean it's the most simple answer: Why when we were children did we want to be an adult? Because it's something we think looks great and when it happens you get the good and you get the bad and you sometimes realize maybe the bad outweighs the good and want the good back. So onto the film; I did want to see The Change Up, it seemed like it would try to be a good comedy, boy did it wanna prove me wrong on so many levels.",/review/rw2494818/?ref_=tt_urv

","What are you morons talking about? This movie is hilarious, from beginning to end! Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman do an amazing job. The kids are cute and funny as can be. The storyline is old but they did it masterfully with a twist of their own. Absolutely loved it, I've watched it 7 times already, lol. The part where he's in the boardroom floors me every time. If you love raunchy foul mouth comedy you will love it, If u are a prude with a stick up your ass u will hate it as much as u hate your miserable life! Sorry if I'm going off a bit but after reading the reviews I have to put these goody goody morons in their place. If u don't like raunchy comedy don't watch this R rated comedy and go watch Home Alone reruns!",/review/rw2494818/?ref_=tt_urv

","I saw this film in the theaters and enjoyed it enough to write this review (which is my first on IMDb). Crass humor, sappy storyline, nothing exceptional to say the least . . . But, I loved it! If the humor wasn't so rude and the characters not so insensitive and shallow, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed this movie as much as I did. Half the fun was in watching these fellas on screen saying and doing stuff we wouldn't dream of doing in real life for fear of offending others or making fools of ourselves. Some scenes would have me squirming in awkward jaw-dropped discomfort while inwardly savoring the moment with a vicarious thrill.",/review/rw2494818/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2012,Robert_duder,8," Not your Mama's Freaky Friday, hilarious and fun but R rated to the core
","I am not one to promote or even enjoy gross out crude comedies and they are a dime a dozen nowadays. Its too easy for film makers in the Judd Apatow world to show private body parts, vomit, bodily functions and pass it off as comedy. But every once in awhile it is done right or even decently okay and it can make you laugh despite being crude. The Change Up is raunchy. There is no ifs ands or butts about it. You don't get much raunchier than this but its also fun and will make you laugh despite yourself and the performances of the lead cast are excellent and the chemistry just works really well. This is probably the first body swap comedy to go full on R-rated so good for them for mixing it up because any comparisons to Freaky Friday are lost because this is about as far away from Disney as you can get.",/review/rw2494818/?ref_=tt_urv

","Ryan Reynolds is so badly cast as a vulgar and narcissistic cretin that he seems no less awkward when he's supposed to have Jason Bateman's personality than he is as himself. Body switching movies are supposed to have unbelievable premises but peeing in a fountain?!!? Poor Leslie Mann has to undergo every indignity a woman can - the farting scene is just gross. And, of course, we have to have the now-obligatory scene were liquid poop geysers out of the baby's rear 8 feet up in the air aat a 45 degree angle!

","The premise is nothing new and there are countless of films, plays and essentially stories out there that deals with a very common fantasy of having to be put literally into someone else's shoes by taking over the body, and living out his or her life in one whacked mistaken identity episode. One of my earliest films of the genre is Like Father Like Son starring Kirk Cameron, and parent-child body swap has become one of the more popular tools used to preach and revolve around uptight parents needing to loosen up, and children to understand that it's basically not easy to bring them up.",/review/rw2494818/?ref_=tt_urv
