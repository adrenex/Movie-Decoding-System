18 December 2021,JohnRayPeterson,9," Irish romanticism, I can't explain it, won't try, but I love it anyway.
","Today's social media generation would dismiss the movie as... as... I don't know what pejorative insensitive word they'd use, but it doesn't matter. It wouldn't matter to the characters to be sure, and it certainly doesn't matter to me. A young boy and girl grow up neighbours, friends and more, and the only thing they aren't is lovers. A terrible waste of time in anyone's life, that they haven't..",/review/rw6410836/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2021,TxMike,," The story of Rosemary and Anthony in pastoral Ireland.
","There is an old Irish song ""Will Ye Go Lassie Go"" and within the lyrics is the phrase ""The wild mountain thyme Grows around the bloomin' heather."" That is the derivation of the title of the movie. It is set and filmed in rural Ireland and the scenery is beautiful.",/review/rw6410836/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2020,kgrv2000,8," Beautiful and funny
","I don't get the bad reviews. This movie is one of very few movies that made me laugh and chuckle out loud. It's not your typical rom-com movie, it's quirky, and strange in an adorable way. Although at first I thought this movie could have used younger actors, Blunt and Dornan made it work. The Irish scenery is just spectacular, it's in my bucket list of places to see.
Just don't overthink this movie, just enjoy the silliness and quirkiness of the ride. You might want to have closed caption on though (I do with all British movies, or those with Irish, Scottish accents). It's a feel good movie, nuff said. We could all use some these days.",/review/rw6410836/?ref_=tt_urv

",Some people may not entirely have the same conversation or think of what the movie will end up discussing when I say that summary line. I wouldn't even want to start explaining it. It is one of the weirdest things put on film ... I'd argue in a good sense.,/review/rw6410836/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2020,atractiveeyes,6," Cute
","This movie is just weird. In order to enjoy it just don't take it seriously because it doesn't even take itself seriously. The story is ridiculous and cheesy but enjoyable because weirdly the ridiculousness of it is what makes it fun and entertaining. Emily Blunt is awesome and Jamie Dornan is very good. The cinematography is stunning with amazing sceneries of the Irish landscapes, it made me fall in love with the country. Wild Mountain Thyme is a cute funny stupid movie, if you're in the mood for such films then don't miss it out.",/review/rw6410836/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2021,MovieQween-33622,8," I get why people might be hard on it but I really liked it!
","So I can see where some people might not like this movie. It's a little choppy and all over the place. Is it perfect? No. Is it critic friendly? Also no. But I actually really liked it! It was silly and chaotic but also heartwarming and charming. I love Emily blunt always and I liked Jamie dornan too! If you love quirky, silly love stories with some true heart, give this one a shot. Maybe it was my particular mood but I enjoyed it! Look forward to watching it again in a few months to enjoy it all over again.",/review/rw6410836/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2020,matteveland95,8," Uniquely lovely.
",I really enjoyed this. Maybe it was good timing. Unique dialogue that leaves you following closely. Antoni may have been the main character but Rosemary is our protagonist and she is wonderful. A great love story with great supporting characters.,/review/rw6410836/?ref_=tt_urv

24 September 2021,juanmuscle,10," I loved every moment of this...
","I loved how he dissolved all the characters with not just wit and cuteness and adorableness and sincerity bound by antiquated traditions but also with intelligence and extreme style! The ending is spectacular and reels everyone and everything in and it all works for a super great experience , a great magnificent story-teller indeed!",/review/rw6410836/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2021,imursel,8," Play it again, Rosemary
",One of the best love movies of all time. Very intense and romance. I don't get the negative reviews. Maybe is better for some audience to watch the film rather then to use their cellphone during the projection.,/review/rw6410836/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2021,eddie_baggins,4," A bizarre Irish romance that defies explanation
","Based purely on face value, there is no way one would head into the picturesque Irish romantic drama Wild Mountain Thyme expecting a bizarre head-scratcher of a movie but John Patrick Shanley's feature length adaptation of his own Broadway play is exactly that, a bizarre oddity that defies explanation by even the most seasoned of film scholars.",/review/rw6410836/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2021,rish2006,8," Finally sometime New and Fresh.
","This is not a typical Rom-Com, but different from it. A large amount of entertainment is not there like in the commercial movies, but it's vibes in the film just gives you a feeling of a different experience. The low rating is there because there isn't any extraordinary entertainment there. But a smart person will know how unique and worthy this film is ðŸ’™.",/review/rw6410836/?ref_=tt_urv

","In a while the shamrock hits hard and out comes a green emerald looking romantic irish movie, that will, if you have some grace of god and some common sense, will make you laugh and cry either you will or not. its the story about the farmgirl that wants a husband, and the eextremely shy neighbour farmboy who really wants a wife, but thinks he is a honeybee, and asks the donkey if it wants to marry him, because he wont inherit the farm from his dad if he aint getting married..",/review/rw6410836/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2021,rayres0708,8," Sweet & lovely
",My husband and I both liked this movie. It was funny in the vein of another Irish film we like called Matchmaker. I don't get the negative reviews. I think people who don't like that genre aren't going to get this or enjoy its quirky sense of humor. But Emily Blunt and Jamie Dornan both do a great job. The weakest part of this movie is Christopher Walken's Irish accent.,/review/rw6410836/?ref_=tt_urv

",Rosemary Muldoon (Emily Blunt) and Anthony Reilly (Jamie Dornan) are neighboring farmers. She has been in love with him since childhood but he never reciprocates for unknown reasons. His father Tony (Christopher Walken) is unwilling to wait any longer for him to find a wife and plans to sell the family farm to his American nephew Adam (Jon Hamm). It leaves Anthony without his being and leaves Rosemary without her hope.,/review/rw6410836/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2020,zeus-rikko,8," Watch This Movie As A Love Story Not a Documentary
","The different reviews I have read encouraged me to add my two cents. I found this movie charming. Were the accents accurate? I couldn't tell you. I am not Irish but am aware that there are lots of different accents within the country depending on the area the people come from. I know the scenery was beautiful and made me want to go there on vacation. The people appeared charming not backwards like one reviewer stated.
I saw a love story between two people whose beliefs and thought processes are different from mine.
Everyone has some ""crazies"". The trick is to find someone who can accept them and if you are lucky learn to love them because they love you. That's what this movie showed me.
I admit to having to see it twice which helped my understanding of the gist of some of the conversations because of my being unfamiliar with some of the dialect and or slang.
The actors performances to me were very good, believable, and charming.",/review/rw6410836/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2020,smaimes91,7," Primarily it is a romance
","The scenery is good, Emily Blunt is beautiful, and this movie is a romance. It is slow moving - the second half has several nice romantic scenes and the last 5 minutes are delightful. Many dragging moments and boring Irish-stuff.... It passes the time and no one is murdered. You need to like romances to really enjoy it.",/review/rw6410836/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2020,paul-allaer,4," What a collosal waste of talent
","""Wild Mountain Thyme"" (2020 release from Ireland; 102 min.) brings the story of Anthony and Rosemary. As the movie opens, we are introduced to two Irish farming families that live next to each other in County Mayo, with a young boy Anthony in the one family, and a young girl Rosemary in the other family. After a clever montage, young Rosemary morphs into today's Emily Blunt. As it happens, they have just buried Rosemary's father. But there is trouble in the other family too, as Anthony's dad is planning on gifting the farm to an American nephew, given Anthony's supposed dislike for farming. Meanwhile Rosemary is hoping to turn the lifelong friendship with Anthony into more... What's holding Anthony up? At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw6410836/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2021,girvsjoint,8," A little bit of Blarney....
","I warmed to this film more as it went on, it's certainly not fast moving, but does slowly draw you in, the non Irish leads like Emily Blunt and Christopher Walken handled their Irish characters well I thought, the supporting cast were good, although I did keep looking out for Barry Fitzgerald, sadly to no avail. Definitely not in the same class as 'The Quiet Man', but a lot better than some of the lesser reviews indicate!",/review/rw6410836/?ref_=tt_urv

","Dream cinematography, great actors... and you managed to make a film which was bellow any standard? John Patrick Shanley - it's all on you: the childish script, the missing humour, lack of any rhythm, the laughable costumes !",/review/rw6410836/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2020,PennyReviews,2," Not Good Enough
","Wild Mountain Thyme was wierd, boring and pointless. The one thing that it was nice about this movie is the cinematography and the scenery. The rest was just... well, not what one should expect from a romance. The first half was confusing, boring and off beat. The second was faster, with fewer tiring scenes, but with obvious theatrical dialogues, and a bizzare climax, which was a let down. As for the accents, they were not only bad, but it was hard to understand them sometimes.",/review/rw6410836/?ref_=tt_urv
