25 May 2006,DonFishies,8," An enjoyable film with a bit of everything for everyone
","Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.",/review/rw1536329/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2006,jluis1984,7," Surpassing all the expectations...
","Like most people, I was convinced that Pixar's ""Cars"" was going to be the animated movie of the year and that ""Over the Hedge"" was just another cheap attempt with the proved formula of cute talking animals. I was very surprised by the end result as it ended up not only being an enjoyable fable about friendship and the typical stuff, it is also a very witty commentary about our modern way of life.",/review/rw1536329/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2006,Kryzak,7," Funny, Witty, and Well voiced!
","While this movie doesn't have the depth of Finding Nemo or Shrek, it was a very fun and well done animation by Dreamworks. The animation was first rate, and the animals were very fun to watch. The voice acting was superb and well cast. What I enjoyed the most about this movie (other than the super funny bits here and there) is the social commentary they presented. It's nothing serious, but it shows us how gluttonous many of us ""humans"" have become. While many of the human characters are exaggerations, there's quite a bit of truth behind each caricature. My favorite is the Home Owner Association President. She was so overdone (yet so realistic!) that I wasn't sure if I was laughing because it was so true to life, or if it was just so out there.",/review/rw1536329/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2006,rparham,7," Hedge your bets on fun
","The computer animated film has become to film studios what Mike Tyson was in the ring in the 1980's: a sure thing. You knew that when Tyson walked in the ring, somebody else was going down, and probably rather quickly. The same is true of most computer animated comedies these days: it is near sure to be a mix of material targeted at children and adults, feature lots of star voices and be entertaining, for the most part at least. Over the Hedge, the latest offering from Dreamworks, does not disappoint on any of the above fronts, and proves to be one more notch in computer animations belt.",/review/rw1536329/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2006,bensonmum2,7," After a few missteps, DreamWorks comes up with a winner
","Having seen the abysmal products DreamWorks has put out recently (Madagascar was bad and Shark Tale was unwatchable), I wasn't expecting much from Over the Hedge. I couldn't have been more wrong. Over the Hedge is an enjoyable story of a band of animals faced with the prospect of finding food as suburbia encroaches on their home. While there are a few slow spots, most of it is very well done. There are some segments that are genuinely laugh-out-loud funny, none more so than a 2 minute scene near the end featuring the spastic, hyper Hammy. The script is well written, taking pokes at rampant consumerism and the need to preserve the environment without ever feeling preachy. The animation in Over the Hedge is top notch and the voice work is exceptional with Wanda Sykes being the standout to me. In short, my wife and I had a great time with it and our three year old stayed entertained throughout. What more can you ask?",/review/rw1536329/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2011,Sylviastel,," A Great Family Film even for Adults!
","The animation is quite brilliant and the voices of stars like Allison Janney, Bruce Willis, Thomas Haden Church, Wanda Sykes, Garry Shandling, and Steve Carrell only enhances the film. They play the roles of chipmunk, skunk, squirrel, a bear, and humans in the film. I have to say that the humans were deliciously fun to watch. The woman played by Allison Janney is a typical suburbanite with a deep seeded hatred for pests and rodents in particular. She contacts the exterminator played wonderfully by Thomas Haden Church in the role. Their voices add to the characters. Anyway, she sets up an elaborate system where nothing can live in her backyard. Anyway, the animals that live nearby in the hedge are humanized with voices to develop their character senses. There is a lot of adventure in the film and you wouldn't be human if you didn't want to see the animals win this time. It's a wild ride!",/review/rw1536329/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2006,diac228,7," Fun when it wants to be, boring when it wants to deliver a message, Over the Hedge is no Madagascar, but is better than previous animated films
","Dreamworks, the anti-Disney, is a hit-miss animation company that sometimes delivers few of among the best animated films, but sometimes also flounder by delivering some stinkers. Shrek and Madagascar were excellent animated films that deserve to be in every large ""best animated movies"" list. But, there are also disasters like Shark Tale and also the disappointing Shrek 2. Over the Hedge is not a classic by any means, but it is entertaining enough to keep you awake throughout the short 83 minutes. The voice talent was all there, the writing was there, but the pacing kind of ruins it for a short time. Unfortunately, the sentimental value has to always be thrown in, and the movie totally slows down during those sappy, slow, unhappy moments. But, when a chase scene arrives, prepared to be dazzled and very amused. Thank goodness the third act picks up the tempo as it lifts the film from total mediocrity and dissatisfaction into a nice, charming film that is worthy of watching more than once.",/review/rw1536329/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2006,TheMovieMark,7," Finally, DreamWorks decides NOT to rely on animal flatulence. Thank you!
","I'm always more than willing to carry the ""DreamWorks ain't got nothing on Pixar!"" banner when it comes to the issue of comparing their CGI-animated films. All you have to do is watch Shark Tale (though I don't recommend it) and then compare it to Finding Nemo to understand why.",/review/rw1536329/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," This is definitely one of the better Dreamworks animated movies
","I really wasn't expecting to enjoy Over the Hedge as much as I did. Perhaps not as stirring as the Prince of Egypt or as zany as Shrek, but it is an improvement on Shark Tale. Well, Over the Hedge is absolutely delightful family entertainment. If I had a minor quibble, it would be that the writing isn't always as sharp as it could have been but this is only occasionally, plus the film was a little on the short side. But all the same, it is very very funny especially the uproarious action sequences at the beginning, and the gags come thick and fast. The CGI animation on the animals is very well done and the backgrounds are audacious. The soundtrack is cool, and the story is engaging and heartwarming. The film is also quite sweet, not sickly sweet, like say Troll in Central Park, but naturally sweet.",/review/rw1536329/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2006,Lady_Targaryen,6," Taking back the neighborhood... One snack at a time.
","I watched ''Over the Hedge '' 2 days ago in the movie theaters and I am surprised how ordinary this movie is! The reason of my surprise, is that I saw that this movie had the box office of 34 million dollars(a LOT of money) and for so many people go to watch this movie in the cinema, I expected it to be great. But in my opinion, this film isn't a big deal and I still prefer Madagascar. Of course, it's cute, a good choice for kids and has a positive message, but the story is not so appealing to older audiences as Shrek is, for example.",/review/rw1536329/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2006,fwomp,4," Urban Sprawl Meets The Varments
","Animated films have some stiff competition. Not only do they have to compete against some truly marvelous predecessors (see SHREK, HOODWINKED, and FINDING NEMO), they also have to entertain not just kids, but adults who enjoy taking their kids to watch such films.",/review/rw1536329/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2021,pawanpunjabithewriter,9," I'm gonna gas you so hard your grandchildren will stink!
","I LOVED IT! I completely loved it. It was after-work Friday hours, almost the time to sleep. However, I had an urge to watch something, something really light. The moment I started it, it didn't make me bore for a moment. I got a sharp idea that it's a story about humans from the eyes of animals. Comes up, it's much more than that. It has real comedy, adventurous sit-com and is cunningly clever. The writing is FLAWLESS. The dialogues are better than amazing. It's one of the movies people watch again and again for the terrific dialogues towards the end. Steve Carrell is a legend! It deliver way more than my expectations. I honestly rate it 8.5/10. Yet another clever and funny animated movie.",/review/rw1536329/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2015,Mr-Fusion,6," A Bruce Willis animated movie . . . but not half bad.
","Aside from some of the character models, ""Over the Hedge"" has mostly held up after almost ten years. It's got an exaggerated sense of humor that'll please most kids, and the satiric wit aimed at suburban lazies is worth a few laughs. Not just suburbia, but one of those house farms that springs up outta nowhere, seemingly overnight, like a weed. Most of the movie's spent taking shots at slovenly America's junk food addiction. Does it beat you over the head with this? Sure does, but we had it coming. Plus, you can never take too many jabs at Dr. Phil. Ever.",/review/rw1536329/?ref_=tt_urv

4 September 2007,bob the moo,," Par for the genre course Â– OK for kids but only a handful of laughs for adults
","When raccoon RJ tries to steal the junk food stash of hibernating bear Vincent, he is given a week to replace it or become the food himself. RJ seeks out a new human community that has just been built. Meanwhile, a community of animals awaken from hibernation to find themselves cut off from the wilderness and separated from the neighbours by only a hedge. Despite the reservations of Verne's tale, the community of animals is convinced by RJ that they can gather lots of food from the humans rather than the wild. However RJ's impatience to rebuilt the stock of food for himself sees the neighbours taking action against the invading animals.",/review/rw1536329/?ref_=tt_urv

13 November 2007,brando647,7," Fun Animated Movie for Kids & Adults
","After having seen this movie in theaters, I have to admit: it easily ranks as one of my favorite family movies that I've seen. This is just another gem to come from Dreamworks Animation, who've had more hits than misses in their history. Based on the comic strip by Michael Fry and T. Lewis, the film revolves around a family of scavengers, led by Vern the turtle (voiced by Garry Shandling) who awaken after winter to find that their forest has been overrun by a housing development. They are approached by RJ, a raccoon voiced by Bruce Willis, who has his own reasons for wanting to assist in their hunt for food.",/review/rw1536329/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2006,0rganism,8," A fun movie that thoroughly demolished my low expectations
","Let me say up front, I had low expectations going into the film. Although I like animation a lot, I wasn't too impressed with previous Dreamworks attempts. I tend to regard cutesy previews with suspicion, and was mostly just going along to have a potentially positive movie-going experience with my family. Things got a little worse when we arrived at the theatre, and both the ticket-tearing guy (if cinemas have a technical name for that role, I don't know what it is) and some poor sap from the commissary tried to pressure-sell the ""fresh"" soda and popcorn. We had to go out of our way to avoid an extra ad-hoc kiosk the food vendors established smack in the middle of the lobby. I hope that doesn't become standard practice. The twenty-odd minutes of previews were similarly underwhelming, and I was starting to get a little nervous -- is it going to be one of those days I'll want to forget? Then, at long last, Over the Hedge starts. Now I'm not an avid follower of the comic, partly because I don't get to read newspapers very often. The Over the Hedge strip is kind of a latecoming competitor to affections reserved for the beloved Bloom County of my childhood, so I'm not exactly salivating at the potential content. However, I gotta say, I was blown away from the start.",/review/rw1536329/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2006,traceymeredith,7," A Family Film That's Not Just For the Kids
","I grudgingly agreed to screen Over the Hedge this week, despite my lack of interest from seeing the previews. I am thrilled to tell you that it was well worth my time, and left me with a smile on my face the rest of the day. Everything, from the superb mixture of a real likeness and cartoon feel of the cuddly creatures to the creative style of the animation itself to the wonderful script keeps you entertained from start to finish. Not only is it a fun and safe film to take the kids to, the hilarity of these animals making fun of humans and the wasteful consumer environment we live in is hysterical! Not to mention, Dreamworks put together an awesome cast to pull it all together. See? Bruce Willis CAN do more than just action movies!",/review/rw1536329/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2008,sddavis63,4," It Didn't Blow Me Away
","I chuckled a few times at some of the funnier moments in this movie (which says something right there - the funniest moments could only get a chuckle out of me), became quickly tired of the rather preachy satire of suburban life which reminds us all of the ridiculousness of human wastefulness, and frankly found that the story revolving around RJ the Racoon was unoriginal and bland.",/review/rw1536329/?ref_=tt_urv
