4 July 2018,smatysia,6," I've certainly seen worse
","No, it isn't a great, or terribly good, movie. I've certainly seen worse. And it is certainly too bad that this seemed to ruin Elizabeth Berkley's career. I didn't find her acting to be all that bad. I think that she was a victim to her role. She might not have had the star power or charisma to overcome a bad role, but I think she played it exactly the way Verhoeven wanted. Not sure that the nudity was a problem either, as I don't recall 1995 being all that puritanical. The rest of the acting was OK, too. I've never been a fan of Kyle MacLachland, but his skeevy smarminess was well-suited to his character. Gina Gershon seemed to have great fun chewing the scenery. No, the problem with the film was that every character was intensely dislikeable. (With the exception of Gina Rivera's Molly character) The exposition of Nomi's problems came way toward the end of the movie, when it was really too late to give her a break for all of her previous behavior. I think most of the blame for this being a poorer movie than it needed to be was Eszterhas's.",/review/rw0371179/?ref_=tt_urv

","...took a viciously unfathomable amount of heat for having the courage to turn up the heat in Showgirls, a movie that elevates trash into art. A lot of people think this film is disgusting, but to ME, what's disgusting is how Ms. Berkley (a fearless Leo who does her Leonine pride proud) was anything but lionized for her willingness to lay it all on the line - and lay it, she does, as only a Leo can - with supremely confident and dazzling royal bravado. (Yes, of COURSE I am a Leo too.)   Kyle M. is great here as well, playing the role of Sleaze Personified, and Gina Gershon vamps it up good an' proper to beat the band.   I am still trying to get my hands on the version of the film I saw in theatres, where Nomi's mind-numbingly erotic lap dance sequence and the kick-ass sequence at the end aren't edited.

","What's really gross about 'Showgirls' isn't that it's sexist, shallow or poorly acted... that's the good part! What's gross is that this is what it's creators think is sexy. Everyone involved has immature and ""dirty"" ideas about sex which makes the whole effort juvenile. Who wants to see Nomi finger herself during her monthly? Who on the planet wants to see Kyle Maclachlan naked, bang any living thing with that stupid, stupid '80s hairdo? Would you want to see Bea Arthur having sex? That's about how little I want to see Smiley McWonderchin in anything resembling a sexual position. It's troubling with a super-high EWWW! factor to see other people try to seriously depict what they think is sexy, when the most comprehensive encyclopedia of ""sexy"" you could imagine would still not have room for what they're doing. Nomi's volatility is sexy? or she's a shrieking, combative sociopath?",/review/rw0371179/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was entertained and that's what mattered to me the most in this cheesy flick containing massive amounts of beautiful boobs. And what great boobs they were, ranging from Elizabeth Berkley to Gina Gershon, with nipples extending into the night via buckets of ice, to peak our interest even more.

16 September 2019,Falconeer,7," What's So Funny?
","Typical tale of a young woman hitch-hiking to Las Vegas with just a suitcase and a dream, who finds stardom after a harrowing climb to the top. Only this time iconic director Paul Verhoeven is at the helm, creator of such big films like Robocop and Total Recall. The result is a BIG film, filled with BIG performances and jarring cinematography. Verhoeven expertly weaves the seedy, amoral tale together with the Vegas backdrop, which becomes a character in itself. The neon soaked scenery pops off the screen, along with the garish costumes and stage makeup that is synonymous with the famed desert oasis that is Las Vegas. Believe it or not, some reviews complain that this is a ""tacky production,"" obviously from people who have never been to Vegas or worked in the entertainment industry out there. No, a movie about this place and THESE people can't possibly be subtle, or understated. Those familiar with Verhoeven's earlier work will recognize in ""Showgirls"" the exact same theme and story arc seen in many of his other films. ""Spetters,"" ""Starship Troopers,"" ""Soldier of Orange,"" have a theme IDENTICAL to ""Showgirls."" It's the tale of young people reaching for big dreams, ambitions that are sometimes too lofty to achieve. One of them ""makes it"" while the others get eviscerated trying to succeed. ""Showgirls"" is most similar to ""Spetters"" in this regard. Nomi Malone replaces Rien, who wants to knock the big, established dirt bike racing champ Gerrit Witkamp (Rutger Hauer) out of the top spot and take his place. In Nomi's world Crystal Conners is the big, arrogant star who needs to be pushed aside so Nomi can reach the top. And of course these tales are always accompanied by intense sexuality and violence and violent sexuality. ""Showgirls"" is no different; the direction is faultless and the production values are through the roof. So what happened? It seems that American audiences are simply not able to handle explicit sexuality and nudity on the big screen. Looking at current Hollywood productions, American movies, though loaded with violence, are virtually sex/nudity free. So much so that I am surprised whenever I see a bare breast in a mainstream Hollywood production. Well ""Showgirls"" has it, and possesses a European attitude towards it. Elizabeth Berkley is sexy and fearless in her role as the over ambitious Nomi. She was a tv actress and gives that kind of performance, nothing brilliant but it fits the role perfectly. The real star of this one is Gina Gershon, in her role as the tough as nails Crystal. It's obvious she had a blast making this movie, and her performances makes this a truly fun ride. By no means a great film, but certainly far from a failure, and this one has proven that it has stood the test of time. Pretty much everything else made in 1995 is forgotten, but ""Showgirls"" still receives attention and revival screenings. It's this generation's ""Rocky Horror Picture Show.""",/review/rw0371179/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2000,Captain Ed,1," It must have been meant as a horror film (or horrible)
","Completely bad, no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  This is the first film I ever saw that made nudity boring.

14 November 2001,candigrrl,," Read between the lines!

17 March 2014,ironhorse_iv,3," If you strip the movie bare: you exposed how truly awful the movie is.
","Showgirls is just bad. Not 'bad' in a good way. I knew the movie was going to be a bit naughty with a NC-17 rating, but I didn't know how dumb, the film was going to be. This movie could had been a really good social commentary movie about women who work in the sex industry of Vegas but the movie took a wrong turn, somewhere in production. Directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Joe Eszterhas, the badly written, film plot is simple enough that a brain death idiot can get it. It's about Nomi Malone (Elizabeth Berkley) a bitchy person who treat people like crap, hiking to Las Vegas, hoping to make it as a showgirl. On the way, she get help from some odd reason by Molly Abrams (Gina Ravera). I guess, she likes the way Nomi beat up her car in rage when Nomi get her stuff stolen. Lucky for Nomi, Molly happens to be a seamstress and costume designer for the Goddess, a Stardust Casino show where Nomi hopes to work. She takes Nomi in as a roommate and set up an interview with Stardust's top showgirl dancer, Cristal Connors (Gina Gershon). For some odd reason, Cristal loves to humiliate Nomi and arranges so many auditions for the chorus line of Goddess that she got the part. Although, Cristal is bi-sexual, she treats Nomi like she's a whore. Honestly, what is it her always trying to make Nomi feel cheap. There is no reason for Cristal get her a job, knowing full well that Nomi wants to claim her mantle and become the star of her show. Its bi-polar thrill-seeker dangerous dumb. While Nomi finally secured the fame and fortune she sought by doing the offensive stuff that Cristal said, she would do: Molly's life turn to the worst with Molly meeting musician, Andrew Carver (William Shockley) who rape her. Since Andrew Carver is the Stardust's high-profile celebrity client, Zack Carey (Kyle MacLachlan), theater director for the casino want Nomi to keep it quiet by giving her hash-money. Nomi is force to choose from a life of fame or exposing the scandal for her friend. Honestly, what was the point of this movie? Some characters like James Smith (Glenn Plummer) are totally pointless as he plays little part in the main story, yet, he get way too much screen time. The acting is mediocre. Not the worst, but not the best. The dialogue in this movie is the worst with its corny offensive nature and bad timing. What did I learn from this movie, black people will help you for no good reason, all men are horny perverts and everybody got AIDS. The script seem like an extreme badly-written version of 1950's All about Eve with its themes. Why would anybody pay $2 million for the script, this bad? Then why did United Artist produced on a then-sizable budget of approximately $45 million knowing full well that a NC-17 film wouldn't make lot of money? The film's amounts of graphic sex and nudity is what make most people want to watch this film. It wasn't the 1970s, where soft-core porn had to be seen in theaters. It was the 1990's, where adults could just buy or rent sexual relate VCRs movie and watch them in their house with a lot more privacy. The movie should had went straight to video. It makes no sense!!! Showgirls was the first NC-17 rated film to be given a wide release in mainstream theaters. Since it had audience restriction due to the NC-17 rating, the movie bomb bad. The movie really made Stardust look bad to the point, the whole casino went under years later. Honestly, this movie killed many careers with its unlikeable characters. Elizabeth Berkley was never a good actress even during her time in 1989's Save by the Bell, TV Show, but gees, she is really bad in this movie. Her dancing is really awful as she slow as hell to hit the steps. Nomi is perfectly willing to do what came down to live, on-stage lesbian sex, screwing her boss to get a higher position, and pushing the lead dancer down the stairs to get her job, but she won't use ice cubes to make her nipples perky. What? Nomi is always angry. It's so annoying. It was a bit shocking at the time to see Berkley strip nude, since her character in Save by the Bell, Jesse Spano was a Feminism. Lot of females were alienated by the film's misanthropic attitude not only toward its characters and subject matter, but also the general human existence. Some men hate it too, as men are made to look bad and females look bat crazy. For an exploitation satire film. Fans got what they wanted. Vulgar and crude of what Vegas is, behind the glamour. It just wasn't that funny, or fun to watch. It's not that hard to find if you really want to watch it. But if you watch it on TV: Due to the film's rampant and gratuitous nudity, a censored version was created with black bras and panties digitally rendered to hide all exposed breasts and genitals. Also, several scenes were removed entirely. It's brutally cut up so watch out. It's just better to find the DVD. There is a version known as Director's R-Rated Version, but like I said before. It's just cut up too much to watch. If you going to watch it, watch the NC-17 version. The ""Los Angeles"" freeway sign at the end of the movie, was a hint at a sequel was already planning for, but was abandoned when this movie debuted. The sequel was to have Nomi going to Hollywood and take on the movie business. Anyways, it kinda happen with an unofficial spin-off 2011 sequel titled 'Penny's from Heaven', released direct-to-video. It's just as bad. Overall: Showgirls had its cult followers, but what happen in Vegas, should had stay in Vegas.",/review/rw0371179/?ref_=tt_urv

It is full of wonderful sets, excellent costumes, and all around really slick film-making.

22 August 2004,mfisher452,1," Here's two hours of your life you'll never get back
","Roger Ebert got it right when he called this film 'a waste of a perfectly good NC-17 rating.' From the folks who brought you Total Recall, Basic Instinct and (especially) Robocop comes this loathsome ordeal about a Las Vegas dancer who is an overnight success when a star quite literally 'breaks a leg' (after being pushed down some stairs by the main character). Elizabeth Berkley is a tall, gangling, somewhat uncoordinated actress who plays Nomi Malone, a tall, gangling, somewhat uncoordinated arrested adolescent who wants to be a Las Vegas dancer but refuses to be exploited, which is sort of like going for a swim but refusing to hold your breath. In 'Showgirls,' Berkley wears extremely high-gloss lipstick and pouts in a way that makes her look a lot like The Creature from the Black Lagoon, which is where this movie should be deep-sixed. She seems to think that a petulant flounce is great acting: She uses that move over and over again in this turkey.",/review/rw0371179/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I reviewed this title a year ago, I gave it 3 out of 10 stars and said I'd never watch it again. Well, I decided to give it another chance and watched it two more times when my son wasn't around. I still say it has a poor moral message (that one must resort to devious tactics to get ahead), but I'll admit that it wasn't as bad as I remembered it to be when I saw it 5 years ago. Is it smut? Yes, in several parts, it is smut. But I think what the actual message was, women (and some men) are used for their bodies in the sleazy underbelly of Las Vegas. Also, I think Hollywood was very unfair to Elizabeth Berkley after this movie tanked. I'm not saying it's a favorite of mine (it's not), but it undoubtedly took a lot of courage and hard work to complete this movie. I'm actually really sorry that Elizabeth Berkley's career never recovered after this. She's talented and this movie could have been a lot better; I think the execution was wrong, is all. So it's not a favorite of mine, but I'll admit that it's not nearly as bad as some other movies I've seen in the past. I give it 5 out of 10 stars, for the effort.",/review/rw0371179/?ref_=tt_urv

","Every once in a while, a film comes along that strikes a chord with audiences in such a way that they react strongly; sometimes, because of this, the film can become a hit. The opposite can happen as well. ""Showgirls"" drew some venomous reviews from both critics and audiences, and it quickly gained a reputation as a bad movie--it became a buzzword and a joke immediately. An entire generation of filmgoers who were too young to see ""Showgirls"" (or else uninterested in it) were instructed that it was a bad movie when it was mentioned as such in the all-ages trailer for the big hit ""Scream 2"". More recently, people like Tarantino and a few respected film critics began to admit that they loved the film, and while it's never going to gain acceptance as a serious film, at least people are able to see ""Showgirls"" for what it is instead an opinion based on legend.",/review/rw0371179/?ref_=tt_urv
