17 February 2022,southdavid,6," Alas poor Yorick.
","I'm going to assume that nobody is going to swoop in and save ""Y - The Last Man"" from its cancellation and put my review here, rather than against the last episode of the season. Apologies to any future readers if I'm left looking foolish. Truth be told, it's covid and the expense as well as the lukewarm response that has done for the series, but I can't help but feel that it's refusal to stick with the one aspect of it's three pronged story I was most interested in, means I'm not too sad to not have to watch any more.",/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2021,jegd-847-631407,3," Yorick who?
","Nothing really to add. I read the graphic novel, and it had some flaws, but this series is a complete bastardization of the book. The books followed Yorick, Ampersand, Hero, and 355 through a United States now devoid of all men (except one). This show is basically the same plot but devoid of entertainment. It's incredibly boring. The sole focus is on Diane Lane's character (which I should have seen coming) and how our first woman President is handling this scenario ... It's a completely different story than the novel, as Yorick sits in the background while all the female characters take center stage. They should have called it 'Mom: The First Female President' ... and the amazing women helping her idiot son.",/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2021,Xavier_Stone,1," The Last complete idiot on earth
","The main actor runs around looking for his ex,(which I'm sure he'll find) and chasing after his monkey. Zero clue that he is important and needs to be protected and help with the research. Instead he just meanders around like a chicken with his head cut off.",/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2021,jennfinn,6," YORICK IS A COMPLETE MORON !!
",It's almost impossible to care enough to watch a ushow when the main character is absolutely horrible.,/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2021,roxmewild,4," Very slow moving!
",I am not a comic reader so have no idea how this compares.,/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2021,Gabriel4416,1," Dull, pointless, useless
",Like almost any doomsday/apocalypse themed shows the start was interesting/thrilling.,/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2021,adrive-1,6," Show already cancelled
","Not sure who is smarter - the monkey or the presidents son aka i just want to find beth. He gets himself into trouble because he is always running away like a child, chasing after something, beth, the monkey, cars, god..., I wanted to like the show, sadly too many scenes are irrelevant, especially if you consider what the show is about and how long it will run, its too slow or stupid. The story offers unlimited playground for the writers, so its confusing why is what we see kinda lame?!",/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2021,david-889-610576,5," A good start, but then...
","With perhaps some minor exceptions, I thought the first episode was pretty solid - a very promising introduction with decent exposition and good acting. Was really looking forward to the next episodes.",/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2022,SAJK007,1," Second Review - even more damning
","Well, for some reason, my first review of this show didn't pass the censors. I must have said something a little too controversial (I don't remember what). In this my second attempt, I will try to explain how my problem with this show has nothing to so with its subject matter. Indeed it is an intriguing premise which would have been interesting to watch if it hadn't been then put into the sausage making machine that is genre TV. For some reason, everything even vaguely apocalyptic ends up looking like Mad Max. Characters become caricatures. Storylines become a series of situations while characters are on a quest. This show does not examine what would happen if men disappeared. It's just a hokey premise from which to thrust us into the generic script land of a hundred other similar shows or films. They all have a different jumping off point, but then they just apply the same scripts and cross out character names to replace with the ones they have thought up for this show. They even hire similar actors to fill the roles from one show to the next. This is bland, dull and boring TV at its worst. I cannot tell you just how tired all this crap makes me.",/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2021,ario-34119,4," They don't know how to make a show
","To make a successful show, the first thing you need to do is grab the audience by their collars and force them to sit still on that couch. First episode: you show the audience that most of the main characters are unlikable. Fail. THE main character, a total idiotic a-hole, who is, did I mention this before, that's right, unlikable. Fail. But Diane Lane gets me to episode 2. And what happens in episode 2? Absolutely nothing! I mean, literally, the story moves ZERO inch. You can skip this episode and go straight to the next episode, and you won't miss anything. Oh, and we get to see the main character as totally useless. Also he's the only one in the entire city who doesn't meet anyone, when everyone else are crowded in big groups everywhere. I mean, I didn't Google this or anything, but I thought the female population is bigger than the male, meaning if all men dies, that would be less than half the population. You walk a mile and you're bound to meet someone, but not this guy, and for days too.",/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2021,WinterEcho,5," The show focuses on all the boring aspects of the comic ignoring what made it interesting.
",The comic was great and had the perfect plot/story for a show or movie series. The comic follows Yorick the last living man on earth and his travels seeing how much society broke down and changed.,/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,cherold,5," Intriguing for the first 10 minutes
","The first episode of Y starts with an interesting post-apocalyptic scene and then winds back to show you what lead up to it. While this creates some intrigue, that intrigue is leached away by the various soap-operish stories of the main characters, who are generally unlikeable and uninteresting.",/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2022,edwardeggers,4," Ruined a great book
",Who ever wrote the screen play should never be allowed to work in entertainment again. This book was phenomenal. This show was garbage. Stick to the book!!,/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2021,AfricanBro,6," What could have been.
","It's starting off great, really amazing concept that's showing so much potential but some of the decision making done by the characters is so illogical. I get that some people can be selfish and childish but after an apocalyptic level event you should change right, a bit? Just a little? The show's doing everything right-ish by me so far, four episodes in, but yorick's character is doing enough to put you off of it. They just need to show us, just once at the least, that he's capable of comprehending the gravity of the situation he's in, sure they can keep his personality traits, being selfish, childish and all they just need to dial it down a bit.",/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2021,ashdsteele,," The main character or ""protagonist"" is the most annoying selfish character
","No redeemable qualities here. Pilot episode ok but the main character Yorick is so disrespectful, a complete moron, childish, selfish and never does as he's told, even if it's for his own safety. The world has literally exploded and all he does is think about himself.",/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2021,XTheXXTruthX,3," Read the comic
","Another bland, boring adaptation of a terrific property.",/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2021,anaraguilar,4," Great potential , but boring/annoying characters
","I've watched 1.5 episodes and really can't make myself watch more. I just think this show is so boring. I have not read the comics, but I'm assuming they were good seeing as they adapted a show.",/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2021,heykateforever,9," The Last Scripted Show to be Mad
","So, another entertaining series bites the dust (see Clarice as I make my case), because so many of you have the attention span of a flea these days. As idiot reality shows and so-called adult cartoons encroach on the scripted shows of the past, we keep losing the entertainment and the STORIES that used to prevail on the media platforms. Scream at me all you want, but I stand by my opinion. Many people I know are no longer watching new shows due to the morons who downrate perfectly great shows just because SOME of them are ""too slow,"" or ""too complicated with choppy stories,"" and most of the great ones are getting cancelled (also see The Prodigal Son). They have stopped watching ANY new shows because they are sick and tired of watching most of the best shows get cancelled on a cliffhanger after one season because of the upcoming instant gratification generation who are so immersed in Twitter or Instagram no longer have the ability to let a story grow and flourish.",/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2021,sgiles-4,2," Fans of graphic novel can pass on it.
","I know, I know...everyone always says ""the book is better"". Well in this case the graphic novel was a whole different story. Spent two hours watching something that in no way resembled the books I read years ago. It's as if the writers/producers tried to tell the same story without the humor, fun or excitement that made the original so good. If you are adapting a graphic novel for a show just film it scene for scene and you've got a hit. Doesn't make any sense!!!",/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2021,Tweetienator,3," Execution Boredom
","I don't know the comics but watched because the idea sounded interesting. The big trouble here - the execution of the idea is a total bore, but maybe women dreaming of a world without men will like it more. If you like the concept I recommend a Polish sci-fi comedy movie: Sexmission (1984) - two guys awake in a world where only women survived a great war, it's far more entertaining, sexy and funny too.",/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2021,jackbaumel,," We the People
","We the people are sick and tired of series first episodes that try to introduce every continuing character rather than deal with the plot and relevant protagonists. We do not care or want to know or care for the other characters yet. We want a sense of the challenges ahead. Will the story be action oriented or cerebral or emotional or a combination? If all that happens is that we meet a bunch of people, what is going to bring us back?",/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2021,d-shilling-1,4," Another great comic book adaptation ruined.
",This show should be used in film making schools in years to come - how to take brilliant source material and completely ruin it. This is a very poor show. Avoid it.,/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2021,dwillson-9-379345,2," 3rd Episode & The Last Man in the World
",Is still chasing his monkey around like a 4 year old idiot.,/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2021,riodoce-advogado,2," Boring as hell.
","If you read the Graphic Novel, skip this. Highly boring, the ""last man"" is kinda dumb. 2 star, one for Ms. Lane, and one for the monkey.",/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2021,johnbaggs,3," If you gave it a 10, you have low standards
","Giving a show a 10 to ""offset the bad reviews"" is not only disingenuous, but then, frankly ruins the whole point of the true process.",/review/rw7409677/?ref_=tt_urv
