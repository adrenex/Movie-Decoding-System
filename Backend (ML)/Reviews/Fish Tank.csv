","Steven Seagal reprises his role as a one time SEAL team captain, a counter-terrorist expert who had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive, and protect the hostages... He happens to be on the Grand Continental passenger train traveling from Denver to L.A...

","There's a moment in Howard Hawks' congenial Western, ""Rio Bravo,"" in which some bad guys have captured Wayne and are forcing him to trick a deputy into releasing a prisoner. Wayne, in his John Wayneness, has previously rid the world of a passel of evildoers. As they ready themselves, Wayne mutters something expressive of reluctance, and one of the bad guys says, ""If it had been up to me, you'd have never got up off the floor. Some of those you killed were friends of mine."" ",/review/rw1104305/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 1999,CuriosityKilledShawn,10," Seagal's best and one hell of an exciting ride
","Since 2001 Seagal has been quite happy to let his film career crash and burn while he sings the blues and does all his strange little things in his personal life (have you ever tasted his wine or his energy drink?). But there was a time in the 90s when his name guaranteed you an hour and a half of broken bones, severed limbs, bad guys in agonizing pain and a showdown with a head villain who stands no chance against the awesome hurricane force that is Steven Seagal.",/review/rw1104305/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2006,NickMeron,6," Seagal accidentally ends up on a train full of terrorists and has to save the world
","Yes, the earthquake beam from space (heck, the whole story line and all of the villains too) are totally unbelievable. Frankly, if you can find a ""believable"" action movie, I have a beach house in Arizona you might want to buy. Yes, the production values were not the finest.",/review/rw1104305/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2010,Aaron1375,6," This siege really does not equal the first one.
","This movie was all right for the most part, but in the end becomes the typical Steven Seagal movie with the only major difference being he is actually reprising his role as the cook from the first ""Under Siege"". And the only carryover from that film is the fact he is supposed to be the same guy and cook. Part of the reason this one just did not have what the first film had is partly the no name cast aside from Seagal. The first film had a nice assortment of actors like Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey as the bad guys. It also had a very attractive sidekick for Seagal in that film in the form of a stripper that popped out of a cake. Here he is teamed up with some other dude and I think his niece, so decidedly a step down in the sidekick department. Here some computer terrorist type has hijacked a train and is planning something sinister, of course. He also has a bunch of military type nut jobs at his disposal. Well guess who is on the train, yes the cook from the first film and of course he is going to make things very hard on the bad guys. The action is okay and the film is not bad at all, just has a been there done that feel to it. Though these days almost all films have that same feel to it. So all in all it passes the time okay and is not boring and you get to see Seagal kick butt per the usual in his movies.",/review/rw1104305/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2004,GOWBTW,9," This is a great sequel to the first
","This is one of the best sequels to Steven Seagal. Under Siege 2: Dark Territory is not your ordinary hijack-action-adventure films. Since I do like trains, this movie was a plus for me. The part in this film was everyone, including Ryback(Seagal) got to be part of the action. His niece Sarah, played by Katherine Heigl, knew how to fight back. Bobby Zachs, played by Morris Chestnut, didn't shy away from the action, unless he saw Ryback kill one of the hijackers. The funny part was when one of the female passengers flashed her cleavage saying she ""broke her bra"", the perfect distraction to the hijacker. Great cast, great action, and a great plot I say. I don't care for the critics' opinion, I just liked this movie the way it is! Rating 3 out of 5 stars. 8 out of 10!",/review/rw1104305/?ref_=tt_urv

1 September 1999,moviecat-6,8," Best Steven Seagal movie yet. Exciting and re-watchable.
","The best Steven Seagal movie to date.  This is the second, and apparently the last, in the series in which Seagal plays Casey Ryback, an ex-Navy SEAL Captain, who, as explained in Under Siege, was demoted for punching out a superior for poor intelligence which got many of his men killed.  In Under Siege 2, his character has been promoted from Chief to Lieutenant, although we only find that out in the end.",/review/rw1104305/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2004,martin-530,10," Highly entertaining, implausible action.
","A high water mark in the career of Mr Segal. He returns to the screen as the, unflappable, invincible, ice cool, ultra hard Casey Ryback. See him leap from a speeding train, rock climb, roll in dirt, take bullets in the arm, all without putting a mark on his immaculate black suit. No messing about with drawn out fight scenes against a super hard villain, everyone is dispatched with minimum of effort as no-one is anywhere near as hard as Casey Ryback. No-one is more entertaining as to watch as the one man army than Segal. If you watch this film expecting an intellectual script and fine acting then you will be disappointed. But if you expect that from any all out action film I expect you are a fool. Totally over the top, totally unbelievable but a total blast.",/review/rw1104305/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 1999,gazzo-2,," Seagal on a Train....
","This was pretty good actually, despite having some production problems(word has it that they were thinking of bringing Gary Busey's character back from Under Seige I-yeah, right-off the exploding Sub? Not likely...)But anyways, this worked well for me. I enjoyed Seagal, showed a bit of humour here in places, thought the train gave it a decent closed in setting, liked both Kurtwood Smith and Everett McGill doing what they do best. (Smith has played the worried Pentagon staffer before too, about the same way...) My impression of Bogosian was that he was a bit too wired at times in his portrayal but it worked just the same. Overall an enjoyable if not great action film, the sort Seagal should have made more of.",/review/rw1104305/?ref_=tt_urv

15 December 2011,ringfire211,10," I don't care what anyone says... DIE HARD ON A TRAIN is superb!!
","All right, guys. Let's admit it. This one is a classic. Say what you will about Seagal but he gave us UNDER SIEGE 1 and 2 and he got sucked out into the clouds in the Stuart Baird thrill-ride EXECUTIVE DECISION. And for these 3 films I'm eternally thankful. I still can't change the channel every time this one comes on. C'mon! Trains, terrorists, Katherine Heigl, Seagal at his most zen-like, and Everett McGill as Penn who uses pepper spray as a breath spray. What's not to like? And a techno-nerd bad guy who looks like a demented cross between Elliott Gould and Tim Curry! With classic lines like ""Your safety IS our primary concern. However, if you try anything stupid, Federal Regulations require that I kill you"" I'm surprised this thing didn't win the Oscar for best script...lol.",/review/rw1104305/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2021,rataserf,9," Forgot your hatred of steve, and enjoy the movie
","These days, it is fashionable to be hating Steven Seagal and making fun of his martial arts but back when it came, this was a great movie and a worthy sequel. The technology like particle canon, using satellites to swat stealthy fighters etc that makes no sense was innovative. Having watched it about 20 times in the last 25 years over various media, I should say it is one of those films where you just enjoy and don't get bored. No surprises and quite good even better than the first one. This movie had some great cast like Jonathan Banks (Breaking Bad, Better call saul), Peter Greene (Pulp fiction, The mask) Eric Bogosian (Succession, Uncut gems,Law and order).",/review/rw1104305/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2015,bowmanblue,6," Lightning doesn't really strike twice
","The first 'Under Siege' film was a classic. No, not in the 'Godfather' or 'Empire Strikes Back' kind of way, but in terms of simple nineties action films to eat popcorn to, it was a classic. And an unexpected one at that. Therefore, a sequel was trotted out in the hope that the second film would catch the audience's attention, too. It didn't. Not that it's that bad.",/review/rw1104305/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2003,willsgb,7," easy fun!
","i love this film. its great fun from the off and stands up to its average predecessor in my honest opinion. alright, the effects aren't exactly top notch, and the cliches and obvious acts and outcomes are predictable, but this is meant to be entertainment, its meant to make us gasp, get us hooked and give us some fun to concentrate on for two hours. Steven isn't exactly the worlds best actor but he puts in a decent effort here and the end result is a thoroughly enjoyable, if not epic or memorable, fable about a train thats been hijacked by ex NASA employees with control of a satelite with a powerful laser, on which Casey Riback - Seagal - happens to be traveling on to some funeral, with his niece who isn't a happy bunny. enjoy!",/review/rw1104305/?ref_=tt_urv

","Under Siege 2: Dark Territory starts as ex Navy Seal & chef Casey Ryback (producer Steven Seagal) meets up his niece Sarah (Katherine Heigl) at a train station as they intend to catch the Denver to Los Angeles cross country train, also catching that particular train are ATAC employees Capatin's Linda Gilder (Brenda Bakke) & David Trilling (David Gianopoulos). En-route the train is stopped & hijacked by a gang of mercenaries lead by Penn (Everett McGill) & computer whizz Travis Dane (Eric Bogosian) who force Gilder & Trilling to give him their top secret authorisation codes for a powerful particle beam satellite weapon known as Grazer One developed by ATAC & the CIA, financed by middle eastern bad guy's they intend to destroy the Pentagon & the American eastern seaboard with Grazer One.

27 March 2005,bob the moo,," Enjoyable if basic romp through familiar genre scenario
","Taking a train journey with his estranged niece during his vacation, imagine Casey Ryback's surprise when he finds that his train has been seized by terrorists and his niece is among the hostages  he is annoyed to say the least. The terrorists are mercenaries working with the slightly loopy Travis Dane  a former employer of the government who has developed a satellite weapon of immense power. A few keystrokes later and Dane has control of the satellite and starts a bidding war of rogue nations. With Washington the ultimate target, the military response is hamstrung and ineffective leaving Ryback the only hope (again).",/review/rw1104305/?ref_=tt_urv

3 November 2007,Boba_Fett1138,6," Perhaps a better movie as the first one.
","The first ""Under Siege"" movie is a pretty much overrated one. I mean, it's not that's a bad genre movie but it's a very well known one all over the world and quite frankly I don't see how it deserved this status, since it's a very average action flick in every regard. This movie is basically more of the same. ""Under Siege 2: Dark Territory"" is just a big clone of ""Die Hard"" as the first ""Under Siege"" movie was. The story is also pretty much the same as in the first movie. It's as if they picked up the script from the first movie and simply just changed the settings and characters names.",/review/rw1104305/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2009,thesar-2,3," Kick the Cook
","When 'Under Siege 2: Dark Territory' first came out in 1995, I really liked it. Or, I should say, just simply enjoyed it. It was simple fun, and yes, another shameless 'Die Hard on a (fill in the blank)' rip-off. This time, a train. This is my first viewing since; 14 years later. Though, somewhat ashamed of liking such a bad flick and even considering removing it from my guilty pleasure top ten list. But, I will say the villain, played by Bogosian, was highly entertaining and funny and did better than his role even required of him. Tommy Lee Jones (his counterpart from the original,) he is not. Still, he made his scenes more enjoyable. In addition, I am not a Seagal fan whatsoever, however, comparatively speaking, he's the best of the low-budget clones he mirrored in the 80/90s: Van Damme, Lundgren, Norris, etc. After a plane crash kills his brother, ex-seal Seagal escorts his last living relative (surprisingly played by a very young Katherine Heigl – my, she's come far since) across country on, get this, the very same train terrorist ""siege"" to get back at the government and make money in the process. Speaking earlier of copying 'Die Hard,' you want the same bad-guy premise but in a 100x better flick, rent 'Live Free or Die Hard.' Anyways, suffice to say, Seagal spends his time up and down the train, on top of it, or on a cliff to save his niece and other faceless hostages while cooking up exploding gadgets and even picking up the most clichéd black wisecracking sidekick along the way. Part one made some money, over $150 million worldwide, so why did they strip this of any budget? It was almost embarrassing to see the fake exterior shots when they're inside the moving train.",/review/rw1104305/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2002,Special-K88,," exactly what you'd expect
","Highly watchable sequel has now retired sailor Seagal vacationing with his estranged niece. They're traveling aboard a luxury train, but their once tranquil vacation is abruptly cut short when the train is hijacked by a rogue group of elite mercenaries--led by a disgruntled ex-government employee who's taken over a top secret, high-tech satellite that he's using to try and wipe out Capitol Hill. This is swiftly paced and well-directed, with plenty of edge of your seat action scenes, but being a sequel the film's plotting is routine, the outcome fairly predictable, and the inevitable final showdown just doesn't quite payoff the way it should. **½",/review/rw1104305/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2005,David_Frames,4," The Quintessential Segal Experience
","First a confession - In a dark little corner of my life which some people incidentally think is all of it, I've got time for the work of Steven Segal. You can scoff but some of the most outright disturbingly entertaining movies of the last ten years read like a roll call of his hits. Hard to Kill, Nico, Under Siege, its sequel of which more in a moment, Half Past Dead, Out for a Kill - the man is a cine-alchemist, turning poor, workman like material into solid gold. This is primarily for two reasons. 1)You must be some kind of crazy genius to forge a career with virtually no personality and 2)He is prepared to go further than most stars in the vanity project stakes, in fact next to Segal people like Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger and John Travolta look positively reserved and self-conscious. Under Siege 2 has both of these factors at full strength and in some respects this makes 'Dark Territory' (the sub-title is no understatement) the quintessential Segal Experience. He's been everything from a cop to a University professor (no, seriously) but here the great man reprises his role as Casey Rybeck, an ex-Navy Seal, special ops whathaveyou who jacked it in to pursue a career as a navy chef. In the original Siege and I use the word original purely in the context of first film, Segal saved his ship from terrorists when they threatened to ruin his Japanese rice cakes. In the second version, sorry Installment, Segal is taking his niece, who's very good looking indeed on a Colorado rail journey when its taken over by mercenaries lead by an insane computer genius who plans to destroy Washington using a laser in space. Believe it or not this is almost a Ken Loach set-up in comparison to some of Segal's movies but if you were trying to make the most generic action movie imaginable you'd have a hard time beating this movie. In lesser hands we'd be as dead as one of Rybeck's Poterhouse steaks but Segal the alchemist comes to the rescue and delivers 90 minutes of solid ego-mania and it's a joy to watch. Segal followers will know that when the villains find out who he is and his mêlée of specialist combat tactics (Kick boxing, bomb making, weapons expertise, three Michelin stars) they usually start to panic, all except one head villain, usually no.2 to the main villain (see F.Lee Emery and Michael Caine in On Deadly Ground) who is ill-advisedly confident that he can take our hero in the final reel which of course he doesn't. These scenes show us and reassure Segal that he's one total badass, a man to feared and respected and in case you missed the point Segal's side kick (in this case doubling as black, street talking' comic relief) is there to write it on the blackboard for all the slow kids at the back. Siege has many of these moments in which both Segal's niece and sidekick say things like ""I guess he's a hero"" and in one terrific moment the aforementioned hired help is told by Segal ""oh, you're a hero now?"" only to be told ""No, man you're the hero!"". Willis might have cut in with a quip at this stage but the man with the tan doesn't do jokes or indeed anything except fight and deliver lines in his trademark monotone. Segal's so gloriously vain that he can't even allow himself to be dirtied up over the course of the movie. In Die Hard Willis got beaten, blooded up and shot but not so much as a strand of Segal's hair goes out of place the entire time, the dark jacket remaining in place throughout. This is despite such potential soiling incidents as explosions, armed combat, cliff face hand to hand fighting and leaping out of moving trucks. My favourite scene is the one where the lead heavy thumps Segal in the face during their climatic fight and although he's a bit blooded in that shot by the time he's got up there's barely a scratch on him. What chance does any terrorist stand against that? All that's missing from Dark Territory is a speech of the kind of quality witnessed in the dieing minutes of the aforementioned On Deadly Ground in which the then eco-friendly action hero delivered the monologue that every Greenpeace activist dreams about. So there you have it, if you want to see a one man force of nature at work rent this one out tonight but remember, this isn't even his best - for that you'll be wanting 'Out for a Kill' and only a idiot would refuse an invitation like that.",/review/rw1104305/?ref_=tt_urv
