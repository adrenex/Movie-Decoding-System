31 March 2018,asinyne,8," Powerful and unusual
","It moved slowly at times or was it simply that we expect a higher body count and more explosions in our films? I thought it gained tremendous momentum towards the end and I left feeling very satisfied, uplifted, and quite entertained. This is a very unusual film in many respects. Its very downbeat, almost like film noir...really. Many scenes are quite dark and the lighting effects are really unusual and I found the pleasing. The acting was fine and the and the movie had a very original feel despite everyone knowing about the Apostle Paul and his unique life. I got to say that Christianity has strayed radically from the vision that Paul had!! It was interesting to me how closeups were used in so many scenes. There were some rough scenes including the final ones but that was reality back then and still is in many parts of the world. I recommend this film highly for anyone looking for something deeper that offers a unique perspective on many levels. Definitely worth your time whether you are into religion or not. Good one.",/review/rw4117371/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2018,MovieMan1975,9," Quite moving & poignant
","This movie is far better than your typical Bible or 'faith-based' movie; I admittedly had some low expectations going in to see it and was very surprised by a quality film with a beautiful message. Not for one second did I feel that this was preachy or 'Bible-beating'... it was more pure and authentic and humanist. 
The acting is top notch, with Jim Caviezel, Faulkner, and Olivier Martinez really giving some nuanced and layered performances. Nobody phoned in their roles, you could sense a level of passion and commitment to the story. The music was also excellent, a gorgeous score that was paired with some nice cinematography and production design. The movie looked good and sounded, but importantly - it felt good. 
Lots of films in the devotional genre tend to end up being mere dramatic recreations of the gospels, but this one, while delivering authenticity, was not as concerned with delivering a 'live-action experience of the Bible' so much as striving to express the true message of Paul. That message, the one that is basically Christ's Sermon on the Mount, is the crux of the film. This gives it an emotional heft that is quite poignant. I wasn't so moved by the characters' actions and the story in so much as what they were feeling in their hearts and what they were expressing. 
Dammit this movie hit me right in the feels and I already know it will linger with me for days. That is a good sign that I just participated in some human art. 
Won't win any Oscars, and sadly probably won't light up the box office but this is a fine and beautiful movie with an important and relevant message for the world today.",/review/rw4117371/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2018,naturallyrockin,7," Be prepared for a heavy movie with a great cast
","There's no getting around it - this movie is heavy from start to finish - not a moment of comic relief. It is a very sobering film, showing the terrible toll on lives that can occur when evil tyranny is unchecked. It was a fascinating time in history, and an interesting segment of Paul's life to explore -- rather than his 30 years of ministry and 10,000 miles of travel, we get only a focused glimpse into his final days in Nero's prison, with flashbacks to his original time of conversion.",/review/rw4117371/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2018,CharbelRahme,7," A great christian movie
","As a christian, I totally recommend this movie for people who read Paul's letter and know about his life with the early christians communities.
The screenplay was well written and was faithful to the scripture, which makes the movie a great witness to the life of Paul who changed after the apparition of Christ to him when he was on the way to persecute believers in the middle east.",/review/rw4117371/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2018,erhelvering,10," Very moving if you take the film on its terms
","First off, know what to expect going into this movie. It is not a retelling of the book of Acts and Paul's many exploits. It is about him reaching the end of his life and passing the torch to the next generation of Christians, as they all grapple with the difficulty of following God in the midst of a cruel and evil world. Knowing that, I don't think you will be disappointed.",/review/rw4117371/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2018,Major_ANC,9," Well done
","I like movies of faith though I'm not religious. This is one of the better ones to come out recently. The acting, directing, and especially editing are far superior to Sampson, another recent movie of faith which was supposed to be a blockbuster and failed miserably in every imaginable way (including the box office.)",/review/rw4117371/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2018,l-piotrowski,7," Good Movie, Recommend Seeing
","I saw this movie today and thought it was good, with excellent acting, and location (filmed in Malta which was the place of one of Paul's journeys). The movie doesn't sugar coat the persecution the Christians of that era had to endure, shirk away from divisions within the early church community or difficult questions being asked by those living in those times. The story line drags in a few places but for the most part it is a movie worth seeing in a theater. ",/review/rw4117371/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2018,kris-127-901192,10," An Important Film. Stirring. Brilliant.
","This is an important film. It is the Bible come to life, accurately, and brutally. It speaks of hope, love, redemption, grace, and godliness. In Paul's writings, he paints a clear portrait of a Christ-follower and constantly reminds us why we do what we do. Jim Caviezel is brilliant as Luke, and it's hard not to see him as the Jesus he portrayed in ""The Passion of the Christ"". This actually works, because it is a subtle reminder of the unseen center of the story...Jesus. James Faulkner is exactly who you picture as Paul. His portrayal was spot on. The Bible does not address the end of Paul's life, but history does. This movie tells ""the rest of the story"" and in doing so, answers the persistent question ""if God loves you, why does He let you suffer?"". Read Luke and Acts to learn more. I encourage everyone to go see it to support a good film ...and to stir your soul.",/review/rw4117371/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2018,mamreilly,10," Reverent
","If a movie can be reverent, this is it. The violence against Christians was handled well. The theatre was silent at the end, watching the credits to the end. No one wanted to get up and leave. We need more movies like this.",/review/rw4117371/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2018,tkmcc-08780,8," A good movie even for the non-religious
","This is definitely a religious movie but isn't overwhelmingly so. For example, it doesn't have the overbearing smugness of the protagonist Christians versus incredibly stupid or evil non-Christians. The characters have much more believable and complex motivations, with the Christians mostly (and properly) motivated by their beliefs. There's enough gray in the characters to make the movie interesting. The suffering of the Christians in Rome sometimes goes a bit over the top but not terribly so. 
 
The ""miracle"", which in many faith movies leads to the dramatic conversion of the antagonist, is well done in this movie and should appeal to a wider audience. The back-story, supporting scenes and resolution are quite believable. One pleasant aspect is that the ""miracle"" doesn't require divine intervention or stretching credibility but is due to believable skills and application of good Christian values, and is done with credible tension you'd expect from a first-class movie.

2 April 2018,SeverusSnape38,10," Awesome and powerful
",I don't have too much to say about this film other then it's very powerful. It's obviously sad but there are funny moments too. All the actors did an amazing job. Definitely recommend this film.,/review/rw4117371/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2018,goldeneye19,10," A must see for Christians!
","I was very surprised by this movie in a good way, while not perfect as a movie, it did an amazing job of showing the struggle of early Christians and the impact Paul had on them. My only gripe is the terrible French accent of the ROMAN officer.",/review/rw4117371/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2018,lavatch,8," ""God's Word is Not Chained""
","In this film biography of St. Paul, there was a creative approach taken with depicting the influence of Saul of Tarsus (Paul). Instead of a chronological narrative, the film focuses on the final stage of Paul's life as he is awaiting execution in Rome. This imaginative approach was successful, as it combined truth, legend, and fiction.",/review/rw4117371/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2018,markccorcoran,10," Very uplifting story
","The cinematography was excellent. Shot in Malta, felt like you were in Rome. The acting, dialogue, costumes, and sets were are very well done. The music score is very fitting. Some violence but that is what occurred. Probably one of the best movies I have seen in the last 12 months. I highly recommend it.",/review/rw4117371/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2018,johnt-84136,10," THE Best
","I'm very skeptical of watching a ""biblical"" movie, because, until now, I have not seen one that I considered almost 100% accurate both biblically and historically (with allowance for necessary fictional dialog). Most screenwriters turn most of a movie into their own interpretation of the Bible. Besides that, most have a decidedly Catholic perspective to them. I would take issue with one or two points of ""doctrine,"" but not enough to matter.",/review/rw4117371/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2018,timmytokars,10," Would We Walk that Path?
","This film will be helpful for a young person to hold in their heart and help guide them through the challenges of adolescence and beyond. This film helps get at what it truly is to be Christian. I would have benefited much as a young person -- and indeed will as an adult -- from seeing the stories of the Bible played in the rich context of reality; Paul, the Apostle of Christ provides an historical and moving account of some events the faithful have long been trying to imagine and makes sense of.",/review/rw4117371/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2018,paulteamteasdale,10," Went on a date with my wife and enjoyed this movie!
",It was refreshing to see a movie that really made you think. This movie was well done and they acting was excellent. It game me a feeling of how much the Christians were treated in Rome. It would have been terrible to be a Christian in those times. I,/review/rw4117371/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2018,geometryrocks-28635,9," Where would Christians be without the dedication of Paul, the Apostle?
","This movie has Paul in prison for the second time, in a Roman pit of misery. He is often beaten, often wondering what God's plan is. Yet, he is convinced that he is where the Lord wants him to be. Paul's
 life reminds us that the early church suffered much for the sake of the Gospel. Why would these men and women risk their lives for ""fake news""? They would not. It was because the Son of Man came, lived and died to be resurrected after 3 days and is now seated at the right hand of the Father that Paul, Luke and others risked their lives.. Paul's life was totally given over to proclaiming this Good News. ""For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain."" Philippians 1: 21. Wonderful movie, filled with GOOD NEWS!!!",/review/rw4117371/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2018,kenstallings-65346,9," Relevant today as ever
","The story of the Apostle Paul is told in unflinching realism. The story of Luke's time in Rome with Paul is told in very realistic terms, even as the lack of documentation requires a degree of artistic license.",/review/rw4117371/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2018,stringfire-29124,10," Incredible film

22 April 2018,hatlad,10," Great movie!
","What a well-told story of the plight of Christians after Nero accused them of the burning of Rome, the efforts of Acquila and Priscilla to help the persecuted believers AND of Paul's plight in jail.

6 April 2018,deanocware,10," Full of Grace
","I usually do not write movie reviews although I see my share of them. However I had to write this review if it would convince just one person, especially a Christian, to go and see this movie. This movie tells the story of a part of Paul's life that gave us one of the two books of Timothy in the New Testament and gave me one of my favorite Bible verses about having finished the race and fought the good fight. The screenplay and cinematography in this film is beautiful and the acting and dialogue are graceful. As a Christian I was inspired by the Christians depicted in this film and left the theater proud of the legacy of love and courage that they left us.",/review/rw4117371/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2018,pixrox1,9," My neighbors have been pestering me to know whether I thought that this flick was ""too churchy"" . . .
",". . . because they go there every morning, and twice on Sundays, so they rely upon me for news of the Outside World. I finally had a chance to watch PAUL, APOSTLE OF CHR1ST in action this morning, and I'll be able to reassure my fence mates that they can rest easy (especially if they see PAUL in one of those remodeled multiplexes with the reclining seats). PAUL is more like A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS than THE PASSION OF CHR1ST. Some of the things that PAUL and SEASONS have in common is that they both feature Men of God preaching against a violent ""Church Militant"" (aka, Big Religion) , and they both end with guys losing their noggins for refusing to Kow-Tow to corrupt and murderous Fat Cat rulers. No one can watch PAUL with an open mind and think that this fellow could approve of the Crusades, the opulent palaces of Vatican City, or loading up Auschwitz-bound box cars. While such sects as the Quakers, Shakers, Amish, and Mennonites are happy to go back to the basics and live their lives so they would fit right in with the people projected up on the Big Screen during PAUL, none of Today's churchy celebrities--all of whom wallow in the Wealth of This World--would have a prayer of fitting in with PAUL's circle. Mindless hypocrites who see NO connection between the Gospel of Luke and the Preaching of Paul during the OTHER 167 hours every week (or 160, in the case of my neighbors) and Real Life may well feel comfortable viewing PAUL, APOSTLE OF CHR1ST (especially if they snag those reclining seats). On the other hand, any Church People prone to fits of Critical Thinking should avoid PAUL like the Plague.",/review/rw4117371/?ref_=tt_urv
