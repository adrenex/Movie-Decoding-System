22 May 2016,t-dooley-69-386916,9," Fantastic Mini Series on the Birth of Ireland as a nation.
","I saw this on Netflix and it starts in 1914 where we meet a group of Dubliners, some of whom are still loyal to an ever distant British Crown and others who are confined by the bonds of a colonial power that has abused and neglected its closest colony for hundreds of years – rebellion is in the air.",/review/rw7243299/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2019,cordenw,7," How come they all got Rory McIlroy eyes?
","Has anyone else noticed ?
I'm enjoying it as a history lesson that was never even mentioned in school when I was growing up in Liverpool. Strange, because half the population was Irish (as was my own Grandmother).
Strange too, because it's only now that I'm learning that the English aristocracy treated the peasants in much the same way as they treated the natives in their colonies.
We in Liverpool were too busy trying to eke out a life to be concerned with what was going on in the rest of the dominion. But as I get older and see what mentality drove that same aristocracy, then I have no boundaries for my distaste for them.
First of all they take all of the land, then they take all of the resources the land has to offer, then they sequester the crops, then they charge rents for the properties they've stolen.
You want more?
They call you up to fight their battles for them.",/review/rw7243299/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2017,eddiesterling,8," Worth the watching
","I am from Northern Ireland, so I have to declare an interest in watching this series. After what I felt was a shaky start, I found myself being drawn into the personalities and the events. Episode by episode it seemed to improve. The sets and characterisations were convincing. If there is the odd historical inaccuracy well, this is not a documentary, it is entertainment ... and in that it succeeds.",/review/rw7243299/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2020,KejB,8," Annoying
","Beautifully made. But they replaced three perfectly good female characters with three others, while keeping many of the other (male?!) players in situ for season 2. Not only did this complicate and confuse but frankly dissolved my enthusiasm. I think it undermines the story itself, since everything other than the headlines are fictional.",/review/rw7243299/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2018,ghatbkk,9," Accuracy isn't entirely there, but the feeling of the era is certainly there
","The most important things to know about the Easter Rising were that it marked the return to violent rebellion in Ireland and the way that the English dealt with it started the turning the sympathies of the Irish at large against the English and the idea of home-rule as part of the Empire. Those two things are very well demonstrated in Rebellion, from the brutal dealing of the British military with both the rebellion and Irish civilians, the complete lack of due process for those arrested and executed, creating martyrs and setting the stage for the War of Independence and the Irish Civil War.",/review/rw7243299/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2016,alanmowle,10," Superb emotional rendition.
","I am 85, I was not there, but met Irish (Republic) people in 1949 in Bradford UK, who had relatives alive and emotionally in this historic event. I was 18 (and from a small community) I was forever imbued by the emotions I witnessed, and the varied descriptions. The programme literally had me saying prayers, I was captivated, excited and horrified with the poverty depicted, which I was personally familiar with, being moved about during the WW11. This is a highly enthralling programme, I was very disappointed to learn that episode 5 is the last one. For me the realism was total, the emotions entirely believable. Casting and acting magnificent. I watched the 5 episodes on Netflix.",/review/rw7243299/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2021,mgumsley,6," Full of fervour, but lacks coherence
","Rebellion is a worthy attempt to place the Easter Rising of 1916 and the later rebellions involving the key figures of Michael Collins and Eamon de Valera in a historical context. The arrogance of the British and the keen nationalism of the Irish is depicted with great vigour. The support of the Americans in the Irish uprising is also a vital component. What the series fails to display is the lack of planning in carrying out the rebellion against the British rule, and as a result the programme as a whole lacks coherence. This was particularly obvious in the first series where the Rebellion appeared to be little more than an attempt to take over Dublin Castle.",/review/rw7243299/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2021,margot,8," Historical analysis is missing, but still a lovely production
","This is a very pretty, but confused telling of the 1914-1922 period in Ireland. There are too many characters who look and talk the same, and have little to distinguish them.",/review/rw7243299/?ref_=tt_urv

18 April 2016,sregnault,7," Another Anachronism
","There is a shot of the GPO being bombed at the end of episode 3. You can hear aircraft flying over, and the subtitles read ""Flying Aircraft."" now off course they had aircraft, but none that would sound like that, and none that would drop bombs. Also, can anyone tell me if aircraft were even deployed to the Easter Rising?",/review/rw7243299/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2016,xxharrison,4," Rebels without a script, a dull account of Easter Rising.
","The Easter Rising of 1916 seems perfect for an exciting television dramatisation. Sadly, this isn't it. Telling the story from the perspective of smaller players might have served a human interest story well, except there's little of interest on that front. Instead, the central characters deliver speeches explaining their motivations and actions. This prevents the emergence of any engaging narrative, and doesn't help in explaining a complex situation either. I had hoped the commencement of hostilities might shake things up a little. Again, Rebellion disappointed. It utterly failed to capture the scale of the uprising, making it seem more like a series of side-street skirmishes. Why did the director feel that such a key moment as the storming of the GPO be shown as a peripheral dumb-show to the main action of a minor character being ejected from her taxi? The Proclamation was similarly trivialised. Meanwhile, the various narratives were unraveling as the unfortunate actors confronted ever more implausible plot developments.",/review/rw7243299/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2016,thesbrian,4," Reasonably entertaining, but many inaccuracies
","It's an entertaining story, but it feels like the characters are stereotypes, not real people. Perhaps more grating is the fact that inaccuracies and anachronisms abound. The time is 1916, but there are several terms used which never appeared in English at the time. The character of May uses the term 'brainwashed', which first appeared - in the US - in the early 1950s during and after the Korean War; an apparently British character says 'lootenant' when the correct British pronunciation is 'leftenant' (for some mysterious reason, but that's another discussion). When giving absolution, the priest uses 'Holy Spirit', which only came into use after Vatican II around 1963; 'Holy Ghost', was the term used by Catholics until that time. These are just the things that jumped out at me in the first two episodes.",/review/rw7243299/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2016,surfteach,6," Rebellion
","When I saw the ad for this series, I was hopeful that it would do a good job with an incredibly interesting piece of Irish history. Being Irish/American, I have visited Ireland 10 times and I am a keen student of Irish history. I have been to all of the locations where the 1916 rebellion occurred and stood in the jail cells and at the location of the executions. I also attended a lecture tour by a Trinity College professor through the streets of Dublin including Glasnevin Cemetery where I met the grandson of one of Michael Collins assassination squad members. So I find it remarkable how people can make a picture like this and choose to rewrite the history in ways that do little to enhance the story, when the actual story is more interesting. An example is the story of Elizabeth O' Farrell . Her real story is much more interesting than the distorted soap opera they made of this remarkable woman. There are some saving graces in the series such as the very fine acting by Brian Gleeson, Charlie Murphy, and Barry Ward to name a few. There was also some effective use of the actual locations in Dublin. The combat scenes were well done and at times very powerful. However, too much of the narrative was spent on meaningless story lines like the wastrel brother of Elizabeth or the pregnancy of May, while diluting the most important elements of the actual story. People like Eamon DeValera and are poorly fleshed out and many of the other principal leaders are left out for the sake of tedious love stories and other inane side stories. They had five episodes to portray one of the most important events in modern Irish history and all they made was this glossy soap opera. The film Michael Collins which also contained historical inaccuracies was a much better effort, helped I suspect by having an Irish director. Better luck next times guys with this story.",/review/rw7243299/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2016,sarahmarianwhitmore,10," Fantastic period drama
","I loved this series. Highly addictive, compelling with some amazing tension throughout. Brilliantly written and superb acting throughout. As someone who's not particularly academic I've always struggled to learn about history the conventional way, through books, so am always grateful when TV teaches me something new. This series had my scurrying to the history books afterwards to find out more. The characters were all really easy to identify with and there was a much more realistic representation of the lower classes than is usual in period dramas. There was some wonderful dialogue-free sequences throughout the series which were just mind-blowingly good. I cant wait for season 2.",/review/rw7243299/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2022,doug2go,4," Disappointing
",I was hoping for an action series that focused on the Irish Republican Army vs the only World Super Power of the time - what I got was low budget amateurish action that was a side bar to a melodramatic morass. I can understand why the overall rating is better than a 7 - there are people that actually like melodrama's and watch them on purpose - that isn't me.,/review/rw7243299/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2016,kathy_anne_harris,8," Character relationships made this a great series
","I quite enjoyed this mini series and look forward to another season. It started slowly and the characters were a little wooden but soon got interesting until I couldn't wait to watch more and missed out on sleep! It all looked very good - costumes, hair and sets but it seemed a little like a student play with freshly made costumes until the action started. The relationships got more complicated as the series developed and that saved the show from being a boring historical drama. The main actors were great. Loved the Liz wears her wedding dress the whole series! Surprised to discover Brian Gleeson is only 28. His perpetual frown made him look so much older.",/review/rw7243299/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2021,SeamusMacDuff,7," A Tale of Two Seasons
","Rebellion
Season one tells the story of the Irish Easter Uprising of 1916 revolving around a small group involved in various aspects, particularly ""Three Little Maids"" of Lizzie Butler - a medical student and daughter of a wealthy Protestant banker and his Catholic wife (GOT alums) who secretly supports the IRA, Frances the uber dedicated IRA supporter and an ""orphan bastard"", and May who works in Dublin Castle and is having a complicated affair with her British boss. Another focus is the Mahan family. Arthur is a British soldier back home on leave from WWI who is ordered to put down the rebellion and his native Irish. His brother Danny is another fervent IRA member pulled romantically and otherwise to Lizzie. He lives with Arthur's wife and family including teenage tart Minnie. Rounding out the main cast is a caricature as wastrel son Harry Butler, and Lizzie's fiancé an English officer also back on leave with plans for to be wed.",/review/rw7243299/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2020,WarMovieCollector,7," From a Foreigner viewer perspective, an eye opening period drama.
","So I caught this tv series via Netflix. Very interesting period drama about the Irish revolutionary period. I've seen both Seasons. Season 2 was my favourite, it started to pick up for me in terms of storytelling pacing. The background score is good. It captures the emotion, sacrifice and the toll of the revolution perfectly.",/review/rw7243299/?ref_=tt_urv

","""I didn't look at their CVs,"" It seems like he didn't bother to do a lot of things. A Finnish guy who quite obviously doesn't know much about Irish history directs a series about the most pivotal few weeks in Irish history. Makes sense, but only in Donnybrook where they have a vested interest in downplaying, trivialising and confusing the events of 1916. The old spirit of Irish rebellion scares the bejaysus out of the corrupt establishment in this country,",/review/rw7243299/?ref_=tt_urv
