31 January 2007,dbborroughs,8," Under rated movie that will make you feel good about the ability to come back from tragedy
","This one blindsided me. With some of the worst reviews of the Christmas season I thought that this was going to be time wasted, instead I found one of the more enjoyable movies I've seen in along while. The first half hour of this film is a great capsule of the events leading to and aftermath of the plane crash that wiped out the 1970 Marshall football team. At that point the film shifts gears as Matthew McConaughey is brought in to rebuild the team and be its coach. A feel good movie thats more about rebuilding the cracked soul of a community than football (though football is front and center) this is a movie that works because of the characters, we care about them so we care about the story. Its also got a great pop score. Though far from perfect, and probably not ""great"", its a better than really good movie that the critics completely missed the boat on.",/review/rw3129050/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2007,wlb,9," A movie that needs no dramatization - was accurate
","I spent many summers with my aunt, uncle and cousin in Huntington, WV and was at the University of Virginia in Nov 1970 when the plane carrying most of Marshall's football team crashed. It crashed just a few miles from their home.",/review/rw3129050/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2007,TxMike,," They 'are' Marshall.
","It is factual that the charter plane carrying home the Marshall football team crashed and burned, killing all on board, on November 14, 1970. My second daughter was 1 month old. Only 4 varsity team members survived, those who had stayed behind for various injuries and personal reasons.",/review/rw3129050/?ref_=tt_urv

18 December 2007,michaelRokeefe,8," Inspirational dramatization of a sports tragedy.
","Based on a devastating true life story that rocked the small town of Huntington West Virgina. In November of 1970, the Marshall University football team was almost home from losing their game against East Carolina University; the plane a mile from home hit treetops on a ridge and crashed into a gully. In the fiery plane perished thirty-seven Marshall players, head coach Tolly(Robert Patrick)and five members of his coaching staff, other school staff, flight crew and twenty-two boosters. School President Don Dedmond(David Stratharin)wanted to indefinitely suspend the football program. For the betterment of the community, Dedmon hires a young new head coach Jack Lengyel(Matthew McConaughey)to continue the program. Assistant coach Red Dawson(Matthew Fox) who missed the fateful flight agreed to help rebuild the Thundering Herd. The NCAA under the circumstances waived their rule of not allowing freshmen to play varsity ball. It would be a slow go for the school and town to recover. This movie tries to show the relationships between the injured players that did not travel on the tragic flight, the new coach and school board of directors and the town trying to heal. Marshall University would slowly rise from the ashes that chocked Huntington West Virginia. Also in the cast: Anthony Mackie, Ian McShane, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Arlen Escarpeta, January Jones and Brian Geraghty.",/review/rw3129050/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2006,bkoganbing,10," ""They Don't Know Your Heart""
",Forget the PG rating because some bad words are spoken. This film is one to take the family to. I have to say I was most inspired by the story of a whole university community coming together in the wake of a mind numbing tragedy.,/review/rw3129050/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2006,Cocacolaguy912-2,," Not a cliché football movie.
","The year of 2006 had three football movies...""The Gridiron Gang"", ""Invinsible"", and ""We are Marshall"". Having seen the first two earlier in the year, I was not that excited for We are Marshall. I went in expecting a decent but cliché football movie.",/review/rw3129050/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2007,ccthemovieman-1,9," How To Respond After Tragedy - A Nice Story
","This was a nice movie, interesting all the way, a combination sports film and melodrama and based on a tragic real-life event: a 1970 plane crash that killed 75 people including all but a couple of the players and coaches on the Marshall University football team. ",/review/rw3129050/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2006,llogan1-1,10," This is not just a sports movie!
","I graduated from Marshall University and grew up in Huntington, West Virginia, where the movie takes place, which of course, made this movie especially meaningful to me. I drove 300 miles to see the Premiere in Huntington two days ago, and the audience actually clapped during certain scenes, laughed quite a few times, and there wasn't a dry eye in the house at the end. Though it was extremely poignant for us West Virginians because there were people in the audience whose family members died in that horrible plane crash in 1970, and one of my high school friends was actually there at the crash site with her father who was a State Trooper, and I know other people who lost someone. However, aside from all that, this movie is extremely uplifting. When you are faced with such a horrendous tragedy as losing 75 people, 55 of whom were members of your football team with only a handful of players left as well as the head coach and family members of the football players and other university faculty, etc., it is completely devastating! I remember seeing scenes of the crash on TV, and it was horrible. And then to rebuild a team from scratch when no one even wanted to coach the Thundering Herd (Marshall's football team)? That's totally amazing! ",/review/rw3129050/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2006,seagoddess76,10," Loved it!!!
","The critics seem to be trashing this movie, but for those of us who grew up in Huntington, WV, it was an amazing story and an incredible movie. I laughed, cried, cheered, and then cried some more. I have never been more proud of my hometown. This is not just a story about football. I'm sure you will hear that more than once. It is a story about getting back on your feet. Even when you think things are at their worst. This is a point the critics seem to miss. They compare it to Invincible and other football movies. Don't listen. GO SEE THIS MOVIE! I believe you will love it too! Even if you are not from Huntington, you will be able to relate if you have ever lost someone close. As one of the other posters put it...We are...Marshall!!! Go Herd!",/review/rw3129050/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2017,zkonedog,10," A MUST WATCH For All Sports (Especially Football) Fans
","At its core, this film tells the story of the Marshall College football program of 1971, when a year earlier nearly the entire team was wiped out in a plane crash and thus the entire team had to be rebuilt. Sadly, this is a true story, and this film is able to capture the essence of the entire story in two ways:",/review/rw3129050/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2006,rterrell2,7," Good flick
","As sick as I am of football flicks this year I must admit I rather enjoyed this film. Mainly because of the great performance of its lead. He does a great job as the weird coach that is so offbeat and positive that this town that is healing from the biggest tragedy it has ever known,just does not know have to take him. Mcg also proves he can direct something that is not flashy and slick. It will be a great film for families to see together and it does a good job pulling on the old heartstrings. Matthew Fox also does great as the assistant coach who lived through it all and has many demons to face. WE ARE MARSHELL is the best film of its kind since Remember the Titans.",/review/rw3129050/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2006,wereuat06-1,7," Sad Stroy of Friendship and Teamwork
","This was a great movie, not a superb one but good. The action was on par, the emotions were st great. But this movie is not about that it is about what happened to that team and how the school was changed. It is a feel good story at the end that makes you want to cry but feel good at the same time. I was surprised that Matthew McConaughey was able to play a role as important as this one. But he played as he should have the coach that would not stop and keep pushing his team to the top to give the town and school and kids something good for a change. I also thought Matthew Fox played good coming off such roles as Lost. Every scene in this movie is a good performance and gives you something to think about. And everyone plays there part as if they are the real people from that town.",/review/rw3129050/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2008,lastliberal,7," The funerals end today!
","I love sports movies. You generally know how they are going to turn out. They always catch that pass at the last second, or hit that home run with two out in the bottom of the ninth to win the game, but that doesn't spoil them for me. It is that coming back from the bottom that really inspires.",/review/rw3129050/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2007,dshepherd-6,9," I loved this movie
","I hate football, but I loved this movie! I went to see it because Nate Ruffin was my Supervisor for several years and was the most supportive, understanding human being I've ever known. He often told anyone who would listen how his life took a downward spiral after the crash because he felt so guilty for surviving. But he got his life together and decided the best way he could honor his former teammates was to be an inspiration to others, and he was more than that! Anthony Mackie portrayed Nate wonderfully and caught his spirit of leadership and caring! Nate knew from experience what hardship could do to a person's life and used his story to help many of us through major upheavals in our lives.",/review/rw3129050/?ref_=tt_urv

","I went to watch the movie here in New York State. I absolutely loved the movie as did my entire family. I cried a lot but also laughed here and there.

","I have just seen ""We Are Marshall"" for the fourth time. The first three times I saw it I found the novelty of seeing locals being portrayed, as well as familiar locations being shown, on the big screen just a bit of a distraction. I won't bore you with the details of my life, but I am very close to this story. I have lived and worked in the Huntington area for my whole life, and attended both Marshall and Morehead State Universities.",/review/rw3129050/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2013,billsoccer,8," Moving portrayal of an awful time
","A true-to-life portrayal of the aftermath of the early 70's plane crash which killed an entire football team. The angst of the few who missed the flight. The college decides to restart the program after initially putting it on hold. The search for a coach - Jack Lengyel - whom Matthew McConaughey plays exceptionally well. The meeting with Bobby Bowden, a future football Hall of Famer, who graciously allows the new Marshall coaching staff to scout his team. A well-done movie that avoids becoming maudlin. A must-see. I can think of no real 'buts'. One would have wanted to seem more of what became of Jack Lengyel after his short career there. But, after all, this is a story about the college and football team, though he was a major factor.",/review/rw3129050/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie is so great, it's so touching and emotional. Based on true events, it has a very sad and interesting story, A town with a great football tradition, suffers a painful experience when the 1970 football team die in a plain crash, since then the football program is shut down until a man take the head coach job and tries to rebuild and heal the spirit of the team and the whole community. The cast is impressive, Matthew McConaugheywith this role, gives maybe the best performance of his career, Matthew Fox also acts very well.
