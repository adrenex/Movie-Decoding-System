22 July 2018,ayoreinf,7," Cute at certain moments but simplistic and forced at too many others
","Yes, Charming does have certain charm, it's very beautiful as far as its design goes, and most of the jokes do work. All of the cast performs very professionally, but still. The plot doesn't advance naturally, it doesn't flow it stumbles ahead very predictably, as we all knew it would, to the not surprising end. On the road it hits every cliche in the book, many of them are mentioned as if jokingly, but they move the plot forward despite of making us all aware the scriptwriters know it's a cliche.

15 November 2018,Samanthamjones,5," Wanted to love this but just couldn't
","Demi is amazing. I wanted to love this movie. The soundtrack was great Demis voice acting was on point but the writing just left something to be desired. There just felt like there was stuff missing. We needed an adorable 3rd party to bring in more comedy and sass the bird was great but the part was so small. The story felt as though part of it was left on the editing floor almost like a book adaptation where you're expected to already love and care for the characters and are there for the highlights.
All in all the idea was good, I loved how they pulled so many well loved tales together to feature in this but it is a forgettable movie.",/review/rw4423250/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2019,ghelik,5," Can Hollywood please hire better scriptwriters?
","The story was duuuuulllllllll. It had funny moments and references, but the character interaction was so forced. The story lacked well.... everything and enough already with these True Love stories.
The only redeeming quality to this thing was the art and the care put into little details like the pictures in the place's walls. The characters were no Disney, but nice to look at and the voice actors did a decent enough job.",/review/rw4423250/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2021,stevebondi,5," Not an animated classic, and at best, for young kids :-(
","Apparently lower budgets can pull off decent CG, but not enough to pay for scripts that can delight all ages :-(",/review/rw4423250/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2018,leoxatzian,6," It might have charm, but it is not irresistible.
","This new fairytale themed comedy by Dreamworks might not be the new ""Shrek"", but it has a fair amount of charm to stand out on it's own. The plot starts out with some really unique ideas, but becomes a bit more predictable and cliche as it goes on. The comedy does not always stick the landing, but when it does, it is undeniably funny. Some characters are properly developed and likeable, but the same can't be sayed about all of them. In conclusion, this movie can be considered hit or miss depending on how you view it.",/review/rw4423250/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2019,ray115,6," Comic fairytale
","Nice little comic fairytale with familiar characters. Three rich babes Cinderella, The Snow White and Sleeping Beauty all plan to marry with their savior which happens to be the same prince.
Don't expect ultra good animation or complicated plot twists but still OK.",/review/rw4423250/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2021,fmartin-21394,7," ""Charming"" film for kids
","I liked this movie more than I thought I would. I think the awesome music helped a lot - I think without it the film would be kind of meh. The concept is fun though - why is Prince Charming rescuing multiple princesses in all those fairy tales? Oops. Now he's got problems. Overall, it's an enjoyable film for kids and something to play during a lazy afternoon, but I've seen better.",/review/rw4423250/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2019,goebs-71450,10," Kids loved it
","Not going to over analyze a movie meant for kids, but simply they loved it and basically want to watch it on repeat over and over again. The soundtrack is great and doesn't get super annoying like some other movies.",/review/rw4423250/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2019,lisafordeay,8," An enjoyable film
","Charming is an Animated Musical Comedy starring the voices of Avril Lavinge,Demi Lovato,Wilmer Valdermerra and Ashley Tisdale and tell the story of a handsome prince named Prince Charming(Wilmer Valdermerra) who is under a curse where every woman falls in love with him. Problems arise when Charming meets a runaway thief named Lenore(Lovato) in disguise who at first doesn't see eye to eye with the prince but romance blossoms between them.
Will the prince lift the curse and find his actual true love ?
The animation is gorgeous,the voice cast is great,and the chemistry between Demi and her real life ex(both serve as producers in the music department and the film)was sweet. One of the reasons I was drawn to this film was Demi Lovato as I am a massive fan of her's for 10 years. If you love Shrek and Tangled then you will love this film. Girls aged 6 would enjoy it too.",/review/rw4423250/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2018,DuskShadow,6," NOt disney , but that may be a good thing
","From everything to reversing the old time gender roles of the gal princess out in the wide world and the hunky prince; here we have THE prince charming after his romps and minor adventures; cursed, attracting ALL ladies' attention like no other, but the guy begins to feel remorse over the affects and the promised end to love as a result of his bachelorhood continuing. Fairly deep. Coupled with another protagonist in the form of the free willied, treasure seeking rogue that is female, and instead of a girl in a disney film, this ""lady"" is mature enough and the same age of the prince, in body and mind ( no skinny gals here, just an in shape shapely awesome chick).
There are of course many cliches, but it is a medieval romance adventure animated film. However its surely targeted at an older pre teen to teen or older audience by not only the ages of the characters, but the situations, the endless amorous references, plus a bunch of jabs at disney films and jokes from Monty Python films . Its even got John Cleese in this! References to aladdin, cinderella, sleeping beauty, snow white. Forget em. The characters had deeper emotions and motivations, that though not properly expressedal lthe time, got across well enough to relate. This was a funny movie and the music, done by SIA, was pretty good as well. I am was glad to have watched it. Heres to changing up the formula! 6/10",/review/rw4423250/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2018,SilverOrlov,6," ""Pop drawing""
","The story itself is not bad, but realization is the same as the music in this animation - just pop for little girls. Silly grimacing and flat jokes are cute at certain moments, but make a bad picture when such realization is almost 100% of all time in that cartoon.",/review/rw4423250/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2018,gidgetthewise,7," I loved this movie and the score was stellar.
","You take a story where the Prince is in sure straits. Always having maidens fall but for him but not for true love. This a novel idea. Add to it that it's a curse and it's affecting every maiden and the mrnfolk are taking up arms against him
If buy that. The score is beautiful. I really like this movie alot.",/review/rw4423250/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2018,hippokay,1," Terrible animation poor storyline not funny, wanted to punch myself
","I'm surprised that this animation was released in cinemas because it looked very amateur. The plot was very forced and did t make sense, it was so pointless, the whole time while watching I wanted to punch myself in the face. The lips were out of sync, at one point I thought it was a foreign animation that was translated to English. It's not , it's like a ho e made d grade animation made in someone's garage. I left feeling pissed of that I took my niece to this garbage. It was not entertaining funny or enjoyable. I cringed and couldn't wait for the movie to end.",/review/rw4423250/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2018,grant-oneill,1," Woeful

8 July 2018,laborcabarbara,3," Stupid
","So i went to see this movie with my daughters (5,7). They liked it. But they like everything without criticism. For an adult it was very very disappointing. ",/review/rw4423250/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2018,adnanhaider,5," Animation and story humors part are not up to standards.
",It seems writer is trying to copy the script.,/review/rw4423250/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2018,facebookma,2," Just awful
","When I started watching this I tought it was an foreigner amateur movie, because the sync is bad, the story is completely pointless, rushed. You don't feel any connection with the characters, they're not well developed and the plot are a big forgettable cliche. Everything just happens because happens. The story didn't convinces anyone. The ""true love"" looks everything apart from love, it just comes from nowhere. The lines are badly written. Seems like they had to cut everything to make the story fit in an hour and a half. Terrible, I was surprised that this movie is on cinema. It feels like it was made in two days and that the productors didn't even care about making it.",/review/rw4423250/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2021,kiannla,3," Cute, in it's own way but also dissapointing.
","I get that Hollywood is pushing extreme feminism, and this movie displays that vividly, by making the main female character strong, and independent. However, by making the princesses that Prince charming saves whiney, vain, weak and stupid, and the prince himself a pathetic mass of uselessness, this movie gives the impression that if you need a man's help then you are weak. Which is not something I would want my daughter to believe, sometimes strength lies within letting someone help you, and it shouldn't matter if it is a man or a woman. Why not teach actually equality and not superiority for once?",/review/rw4423250/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2021,Difkes384842,1," What is going on with kid movies
","They meet for 2 seconds. The prince is sleazy trying to break a curse and a female thief is disguised as a man accompanying him. She is mad that the prince doesn't love her and keeps wooing everything else, but she is way more capable and stronger than him. So they have their only strong/capable female obsess over gaining this sleazy guys affections. She is degrading her own abilities and skills pining over this pathetic, sleazy, weak guy. And snow white is talking about ""good old mouth to mouth"" when she fell in love with him. What....",/review/rw4423250/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2021,madden-brad,5," Cute. Kids liked it :-)

",Awesome movie its very interesting with lovely songs and funny scenes,/review/rw4423250/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2021,xktqutmb,2," Painful on so many levels.
",There are five of us and no one liked this. Neither guys nor girls neither young nor old. Just bad. Overly melodramatic and preachy and the many many attempts at humor fall really flat. It tries to be clever and turn things on its head and subvert expectations but just becomes a messy boring waste of time. I wish I could go into more detail but I kept falling asleep so a lot of this is based on how much the rest of my family hated it. Pixar this ain't but if you are in need of a good nap this is the ticket.,/review/rw4423250/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2021,queendog,9," Predictable but so enjoyable!

25 January 2021,samanthaainger,4," Really wanted to like it...

27 October 2018,Dark_Lord_Mark,8," Good Animated Movie, Going Against a Post Joke World, But Held Back By Feminism
","We live in a post joke, identity victimization driven era, where everything must be apologized for, if you are the wrong gender(m) or wrong color depending on political view.This movie goes against that somewhat.",/review/rw4423250/?ref_=tt_urv
