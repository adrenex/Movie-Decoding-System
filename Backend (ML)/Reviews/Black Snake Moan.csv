","I didn't know what to expect from this comedy and was pleasantly surprised, it exceeds any expectations! It's brilliant, so so funny, I was crying from laughter watching it. Uplifting hilarious series, absolutely fantastic!",/review/rw3868493/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2019,iloveair,9," Absolutely Fantastic
","Don't understand the negative reviews.
I don't usually watch anything BBC but this show is unmissable and Diane Morgan is a joy to watch.",/review/rw3868493/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2017,crazyface-890-492834,10," I Couldn't Breathe !
","After watching this, I thought I'd search around for reviews, I couldn't believe what I was reading in parts. Do people not want to be entertained anymore? This was the FUNNIEST thing the BBC have put out in YEARS!!!! And about time too. There were times I couldn't breathe for laughing and there hasn't been a comedy that has made me like this for a very long time. Ignore any pretentious reviewers who think they know it all this is FUNNY.It's going to be a tough ask to be able to write a series as good as the pilot but as long as the writers are given enough time this could turn out to be a real winner!!! Please God let this be so, as I'm sick to death of flicking though the channels to see only reality rubbish.",/review/rw3868493/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2018,matildenunemn,9," Terrific!
","Julia is a relatable, slightly neurotic working mom, whose annoying mother has suddenly quit looking after her kids. She'll have to face motherhood all by herself, and learn to deal with a number of hilarious challenges, such as pretensious full time moms or ridiculous school events.

27 November 2017,peterrichboy,9," Top of the class
","With a couple of power house writers like Sharon Horgan and Graham Linham on board then you expect Motherland to be good and I'm pleased to report it's every bit as good as there previous work. I'm guessing the writers have based the material on there own experiences bringing up young kids, trying to juggle jobs between the school run and a lazy ex husband and a mother who would rather be socialising than looking after her gran kids. Anna Maxwell Smith is terrific as the frustrated mother who seems permanently on the point of a nervous breakdown and Diane Morgan is very funny as The worldly wise mother who knows every trick in the book when it comes to parenting on the cheap and who to avoid and befriend in the world of Motherhood!",/review/rw3868493/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2022,destiny_west,10," Best Show I've seen in Ages.
","After seeing a quick clip of Motherland on Facebook, I knew I had to watch it immediately. I then binge watched all three seasons in 2 days. I probably could have done it quicker, but I was trying to be sensible and it was Christmas.",/review/rw3868493/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2017,Katiousha,9," Very very funny and real
",I don't know why I never heard about this series. It is certainly the funniest pilot I have seen in a long time. Absolutely hilarious and fresh and real unlike clichÃ©d Hollywood motherhood depictions. At least most mothers I know would surely identify. Really disappointing that there is only this one episode --looking forward to more.,/review/rw3868493/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2016,Sleepin_Dragon,6," It wasn't bad, Anna Maxwell Martin a joy as always.
","Julia is a woman on the edge, struggling to balance the work/parenting balance. Very much committed to her job in corporate events, she finds little time for being a mum. Julia has a lot on at work, forgetting it's half term, she's lumbered with her kids, and soon after lots of other people's too.",/review/rw3868493/?ref_=tt_urv

24 November 2020,loukemp-71117,10," Brilliant writing
","The funny lines come thick and fast from all the characters. Now that it's being rerun on Netflix/ iPlayer I could use subtitles to make sure I didn't miss anything! Anna Maxwell Martin is outstanding (as per usual) as Julia but I also began to appreciate the other actors and the script watching the second time round .
Love it. Roll on Series 3 in 2021. ðŸ˜‚
There are also rumours of a Christmas Special next month !! After lockdown we need you Motherland !",/review/rw3868493/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2021,julianrosser-440-787839,8," Outstandingly good
","Just finished series 1, which is absolutely brilliant. Horgan and Linehan at their very best and delivered by a wonderful cast. Anna Maxwell Martin is a shining star and I wish Sharon Horgan had written herself into the script somewhere. As good as Catastrophe and that's saying something.",/review/rw3868493/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2018,Manunited1981,10," Simply outstanding
",Perfect comedy with great actors and hilarious plots. I laughed so hard at most scenes I couldn't breathe. Bravo BBC. Can't wait for the next series,/review/rw3868493/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2021,mickman91-1,10," Great British sense of humour and heart
","Totally brill. Proof that when all is said and done it is not the budget or the expense which makes for great story and entertainment: it is clever writers and skilled actors. The jokes, particularly in the first and second series, spill out of the actors line after line because the writing is brilliant and the actors do it wonderful justice. Little glances and expressions and perfect timing. Great British sarcasm. Its one you could watch time and time again I'm sure and keep picking little jokes you missed. But there is also a solid and emotionally stimulating story that runs throughout about the challenges of parenting in the modern world. I especially love what they did with Kevin - a stay at home Dad. They really helped move the narrative forward for all the wonderful dads out there who wish to be hands on with their children's care. Bravo.",/review/rw3868493/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2021,lindsey-19601,10," A window into my soul!
","I just love this. Laugh out loud stuff and just perfectly observed. All the horrors of the school gates right here. Anna Maxwell Martin is a dream, I love her! Enjoy x",/review/rw3868493/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2016,Prismark10,6," Kids play
",Anna Maxwell Martin plays a frazzled mother working in corporate events and trying to achieve a work/life balance. It is not going well she brings her kids to school during the school holidays and instead of telling the truth she tells the teacher some lies about her kids being bullied which leads to embarrassment.,/review/rw3868493/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2020,harmonybigland,9," Brilliant.
","I was losing hope of finding something to really make me laugh since I binge-watched This Country. I like documentaries as well as comedies and that's all I could find to watch. But most of those at the moment follow pretty depressing themes and there's only so many you can take before you need some light relief. So I kept flicking through and trying to find a decent comedy I hadn't seen yet. None were really engaging me until I begrudgingly gave Motherland a try. I laughed out loud - alot- at the honest, good old British humour. Classic and fresh at the same time. I'm 45 now but it still rings true of life when I was a young mother, many moons ago. I'm currently sitting up at three in the morning, trying to stave off sleep, watching series one, episode five, as I've become addicted to it. I'm trying not to wake my partner with my laughter in the process. Definitely worth a watch. I believe it's written by Sharon Horgan which makes total sense.",/review/rw3868493/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2022,thejdrage,10," Brilliant and funny
","This is a brilliant British show about beleaguered parents of primary school kids. And what they all go through on an average day, evening, night, year.",/review/rw3868493/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2021,semilovatomanchester,10," Pure genius from start to finish
",Highly recommended comedy series 1 on Netflix,/review/rw3868493/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2021,telbel49,9," They're all horrible!
","I watched the first episode and thought, that woman is horrible. I've watch almost every episode now and I think they're ALL horrible, but I absolutely love it. It's hilarious. It reminds you that people never really grow up or change.",/review/rw3868493/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2017,Egbert802,9," Refreshingly good
","I'm not an avid TV viewer but having watched the first episode on Catch-up we then watched the other 5. I would describe this as a cross between Gavin and Stacey and Bridget Jones. I thought it was very well thought out as far as the situation, plot and characterization was concerned and it was nice to see less famous actors in the roles doing a terrific job of comedy combined with those ""cringe moments"" you might find in The Office or Gavin and Stacey. Anyone who has ever had children will relate to this and will have experienced the characters involved, obviously caricatured and comedicly enhanced for the show. Overall I thought it was extremely entertaining and would be most surprised if it did not get a second series. Certainly streets ahead of some of the other rubbish on TV these days. I look forward to series two.",/review/rw3868493/?ref_=tt_urv
