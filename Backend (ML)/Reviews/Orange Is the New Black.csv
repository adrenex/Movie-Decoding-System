","Touted as a documentary, this turned out to be essentially a lecture by the author, Mark Manson on what the #@%! Is wrong with people, with enough of a slide show to offer a cinematic fig leaf to the proceedings. Based on Manson's book of a similar name (Democratic Congresswoman Katie Porter was seen reading a copy during the sixteen zillion votes for Speaker of the House of the 118th Congress), Manson feels that we spent too many decades trying to make youngsters feel good about themselves, so they are unfit to handle the problems of the world; instead of wondering why they aren't happy, they should realize we are all going to die, find something to give a #@%! About, and give zero #@%!s to all the other stuff.",/review/rw8833370/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a nicely packaged self-help docu made by someone in their 30s for a generation that will only understand anything if it's fed to them in a bunch of 10 second animated clips. I hope the panda Company got some money, because those ads are the only genius in this documentary. You'll be watching this hoping this guy will give you some magical insight about how to be happy, ..you might get a small change of perception about something if you haven't figured it out by yourself yet, but you might easily end up even more depressed after watching this too. I enjoyed the little side stories, but the end message, after all the other random change of perception messages, is that when you realize you're going to die, you think, why do anything.. but then again why do nothing. GEnius! Happiness, here I come! He visited 60 countries, but all of his personal shaky videos are in Thailand. I have also travelled the world, and I also found a lot of happiness in Thailand :P ..the only place l couldn't find happiness was in Texas.",/review/rw8833370/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2023,mitchell-lash,9," Source material 10/10
","Source material 10/10. The documentary isn't as much a documentary, but a video lecture with photos & videos (some historical and very helpful to the narrative, and some stock photos/footage which are often less effective) as b-roll.",/review/rw8833370/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have not read the book with the same name by Mark Manson, but I hear it is good. So, I did not know what to expect from this movie other than what I knew about the main synopsis of both the book and movie.",/review/rw8833370/?ref_=tt_urv

","Death is the inevitable! The guy makes some great points but misses so much. Death; Most try not to think much about it. Some think not carrying about it and accepting it is fulfilling. Then it comes down to this... is there an afterlife? Do things matter at all ? If there is no afterlife then nothing matters and nothing will ever matter. You live; feel; experience; and that's it. Whatever makes you happy; you are the god of your life. But.... If your wrong; There are great consequences to how you choose to live this one life. Heaven/hell ? Who is God? Why am I here ? What is my purpose? We all have made mistakes and done bad things. Doing the wrong thing is called Sin. What dose sin cause; a broken relationship from a perfect God. What can take away my bad ? Doing good ? No; what has been done is done. So what then ? Jesus; who is God come down from heaven who is perfect; was murdered and died on purpose so that his blood would wash away are sins. He took are sin upon himself; paying our debt and rose agin from the grave because he is the only conqueror of DEATH. To Trust in him and ask him to come into your life and change us so that we no longer are a salve to sin. We give him our earthly lives freely. We start a relationship with God and begin to slowly be changed by him. We live righteously for him because we love him and are new people because of him. We agin will live with him as perfect people without sin and pain. If you reject Jesus calling on your life you will not enter his home and will be cast out into a place of crying and teeth gnashing. I wish for no one to have to go there; but it is True. Jesus comes to save the sick and dying not ones who don't believe they need a doctor. Everything you do is known by him and you will have to give an answer for every thought and action. A judgment! It's who you know personally that will get you into this paradise. For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. (Ephesians 2:8)The Bible has all the answers you need. It is God's word. To stare death in the face and not be afraid knowing God is in control and loves you. It is a peace that surpasses all understanding.",/review/rw8833370/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,nikkicuyt,10," Aaah so good!!
","Mark Manson never dissappoints. The way this movie was made (soundtrack, editing, imagery) was beautiful to watch. But even more important: the content was meaningful and powerful. Highly recommend this documentary (which felt like a deeply personal story, intertwined with the lessons Manson learned) to anyone, any age. Especially for teens, I think this is a wonderful and ""comforting"" documentary, yet at the same time makes you think about rather counterintuitive and/or uncomfortable psychological concepts.",/review/rw8833370/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,sinkkumies93,4," This movie was (propably) not approved by Manson's writing team
","Reading The Subtle Art of Not Giving a #@% as a 25-year-old self-help junkie and a fan of counterculture I found the book amazing. It was self-help disguised as something better than personal development. It was beyond that. Rooting in ancient Buddhist philosophies, fueled with great present-day stories like the one about Metallica (that thing just hits me every time).",/review/rw8833370/?ref_=tt_urv
