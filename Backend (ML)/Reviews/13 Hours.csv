12 August 2007,zetes,9," Provides more fun than all of the summer blockbusters put together
","The 14 year-old in me is immensely happy that they're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies, and that they're all the rage, what with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia making loads of cash at the box office. This year will see (and already has seen) several more, most notably The Golden Compass, which has the most exciting trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep. I saw no previews for it, only a couple of commercials. The critical reaction is kind of blah. I wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that I have to wait on a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend. Well, if you'll forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been rightly aligned, because I went to see Stardust, and I loved it. It's not a huge movie like Lord of the Rings. The plot line is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero sets out to look for a fallen star) filled with obstacles. But within that basic outline, the story is lively and imaginative. It's simply aiming to be a lot of fun, and a charming little romance. And it succeeds wonderfully. There were a lot of big films this summer, but none of them were nearly as fun as this one. There's a lot going on, but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent. It isn't a masterpiece, but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like The Princess Bride has (though I don't like it quite as much as the earlier film). A lot of fun to be had here if you're a fan of the genre.",/review/rw1762449/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2007,Chris_Docker,9," A magic that isn't puerile . . .
","The power to dream is a wonderful thing. There's a saying, ""Not all dreamers achieve, but all achievers dream."" By exploring our imagination we shape our own futures. Or build empires. Perhaps overcome our fears, limitations and obstacles. Gain wisdom and benefit mankind. Or (put simply) just find our way to true love and happiness. Freud might express such things in symbols. The language of fantasy.",/review/rw1762449/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2007,tavm,10," Stardust is an underrated humorous fairy tale of the summer movie season
","While I don't consider myself a big fan of fairy tale movies, Stardust intrigued me based on seeing Michelle Pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain (especially since I was about to see her as the bossy Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray). Boy, is she so convincingly evil here as a witch, especially with her age-ugly makeup in the beginning and end! Robert De Niro is also great as the pirate captain who's forced to hide ""in the closet"" to protect his ""reputation""! Just about all the actors like Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many others do fine work here. While Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauties, there's also stunning faces of Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (as Girl Bernard), and Kate Magowan especially when we first meet her. Newcomer Charlie Cox is fine as the lead Tristan and he looked so much like his father Dunstan as a young man that I thought that was him in early scenes with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many comments have compared this to The Princess Bride and while I can see some resemblances, the main difference was that with PB, you always knew it was just an imaginary tale as told by an old man to his grandson. Stardust makes you believe, for the most part, that what you're seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout. So on that note, I highly recommended Stardust.",/review/rw1762449/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2020,Doublej20005,8," Much Better Than it Looks
","Surprised at how much I enjoyed this. The characters were really well developed, the world building was fantastic and the action was really enjoyable. Mark Strong is great as ever as the villain, but it has to be Robert DeNiro who just steals the film in the weirdest role I could think of for him. The story is genuinely intriguing, but it's the world building that really did it for me. I really felt immersed in this fantasy world, and the exposition was delivered really naturally. As much as I have gripes with some of Matthew Vaughn's films, the actual direction is never the issue, and it's quite good here too. Now my main issue is that the film is trying to juggle quite a lot of storylines, and it feels a bit rushed as a result. You could probably cut Michelle Pfieffer's plotline down quite a bit in order to concentrate on the main storyline more. But overall, this is a surprisingly fun film that I would definitely recommend",/review/rw1762449/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2019,tabuno,8," Great Fantasy Entertainment
","10 August 2007. Except for an awkward scene, this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along. Except for one of the Robert DeNiro scenes that doesn't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie, this luscious romantic fairy tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done. In the updated tradition of THE PRINCESS BRIDE this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating. Eight out of Ten Stars.",/review/rw1762449/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I saw the previews for this movie I knew I'd love it but I had no idea how much I'd love it - This movie is so entertaining - A young man sets out on a quest to find a star to bring to his ""Crush/Love interest"" to win her hand in marriage - Little does he know, He is not the only one chasing the star - Brothers fighting for the throne are after it - and Some witches want the star - Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert Deniro, and Claire Danes - are the bigger names - And boy do they play their parts well (Especially Ms Pfeiffer) - Magic, betrayal, and love are only a portion of what's in store for you when you watch this movie - Trust me it's a must see - Very original and entertaining from beginning to finish -",/review/rw1762449/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2008,Boba_Fett1138,8," Quality fun.
","To be honest, I didn't expect this movie to be as good as it turned out to be. No way this movie seemed like one deserving its current 8 out of 10 rating on here. This seemed to me like just another fluffy 'light'-Lord of the Rings children movie. But even though this movie borrows heavily from other movies, it remains a good and certainly fun quality production.",/review/rw1762449/?ref_=tt_urv

1 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,8," Delightful fantasy film!
","This film is lovely to look at, with lavish costumes and beautiful sets. The music is lovely too, with the beautiful Take That song over the end credits, and Ian McKellan lent his wonderfully distinguished voice to the narrator. Michelle Pfeiffer also is very good as Lamia, and Claire Danes is perfectly tolerable as the ""star"". I will say though that Charlie Cox was not entirely convincing at times as the hero, and the film is overlong. However, there are plenty of things to recommend it, particularly a chance to see Robert DeNiro in drag doing the can can. The direction, while not the best direction in existence, is competent, and does give some thrills here and there, like the princes who decide to kill each other. The script is quite witty, a little underdeveloped at times, but not that bad at all. In conclusion, an enjoyable film, not the best I've ever seen, but well worth watching. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",/review/rw1762449/?ref_=tt_urv

19 November 2015,A_Different_Drummer,9," ""Nothing says romance like the gift of a kidnapped injured woman""
","... Is a line of dialog you will not soon forget. As an added bonus it is delivered by Clare Danes no less, some years before she became a TV icon in Homeland (and some years after she first became a TV icon in My So Called Life) So lets not mince words. The golden era of film fantasy was the period 1930s to 1940s (see my review for example of LA BELLE ET LA BETE) and some efforts since then have been hit or miss.",/review/rw1762449/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2007,ferguson-6,7," Shop Boy, fetch me that Star
","Greetings again from the darkness. This one will be compared to ""The Princess Bride"" and although it doesn't measure up to that classic, it is extremely entertaining and well made in its own right. The story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never really explained, but the execution is fine, even building up strong suspense.",/review/rw1762449/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2007,michaelRokeefe,8," Fantastic fantasy treat. You've just got to see it.
","Based on a Neil Garman novel, STARDUST is pleasing to the eye and a great escape flick. Wicked witches, flying pirates, greedy princes and a very magical and forbidden land beyond a protective wall. Tristan(Charlie Cox)is trying to win the heart of the beautiful, but cold Victoria(Sienna Miller). He promises her a fallen star that has landed behind the village wall. He finds the star is not a star at all, but a celestial beauty named Yvaine(Claire Danes). A fairytale-like adventure really gets underway when the wicked witch Lamia(Michelle Pfeffer)tries to steal Yvaine's youth. Tristan pledges allegiance to protect the lovely Yvaine, and he doesn't know it yet...he is falling in love with her. Also in the cast: Robert De Niro, Peter O'Toole, Melanie Hill, Henry Cavill, Jason Fleming and Mark Strong. Photographed beautifully. De Niro is a hoot to watch. Danes is simply adorable. Rated PG-13 for fantasy violence and a bit of risqué humor. That should not be a deterrent though. STARDUST is magical.",/review/rw1762449/?ref_=tt_urv

In the fantasy kingdom, he meets the star Yvaine (Claire Danes) and imprisons her with a magic rope, promising to release her after meeting Victoria. Yvaine was hit by the magic ruby of the evil King (Peter O'Toole) of Stormhold that has promised his throne to the son that could find the stone.

12 November 2007,dave_wright87,9," The most fantastical adventure of the year!
","I went into this film with modest hopes, the director had pedigree, I had seen Charlie Cox in Casanova and was impressed, and literally EVERYONE had been raving about it. As the story started to unfold I was introduced to Victorian England on one side of a mysterious Wall, and on the other a magical land, Stormhold. The actual plot weaves together many strands and I don't want to ruin the surprises for anyone, but at the barest it is the simple tale of a young man (Charlie Cox) in love with the village beauty (Sienna Miller). To win her love he tells her he will fetch back a fallen star from the other side of the Wall. Howver when he arrives at the star he finds not a lump of astral metal as he expected but a beautiful woman (Claire Danes). As the two journey back to the wall they find themselves in the adventure of a lifetime. The visuals are brilliant, England looks stunning, in a similar fashion to New Zealand in LOTR, and it s full of wonderful little flourishes, such as the way that the star shines when she is happy, a very simple effect, but one that looks radiant. As well as this the acting good, especially from the leads and Robert DeNiro, whose turn as the captain of an airship is incredibly memorable. This film is THE perfect date movie, it is romantic without being a ""chick flick"", funny and full of wonderful action pieces that will satisfy any action film fan. All in all it is a truly magical experience from beginning to end, and I now Im raving about it to EVERYONE!",/review/rw1762449/?ref_=tt_urv
