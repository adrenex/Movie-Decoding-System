","Mad Men was such a terrific show that is absolutely just as good as everyone says it is. I never watched it when it was originally on but after hearing so many great things about it I finally gave it a chance and streamed it. I was blown away but how much I loved it. There's a reason it won so many awards when it was on...because it's terrific! The acting, writing, directing, production, attention to detail, etc are all among the best in television history! I can see why some people may not like it because it does starts off a little slow but give it a few episodes because it absolutely pays off and then you won't want to stop watching it until you binge the entire series!",/review/rw3664662/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm not easy to please with TV shows. I find typical TV writing tropes to be intolerable so when I say something is brilliant, it's high praise. I tried to watch mad men a couple of years ago but couldn't make it past a few episodes but I decided to give it another try recently and it's absolutely blown me away.",/review/rw3664662/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2015,Instant_Palmer,10," The Greatest TV Drama Series? ðŸ’¯
","The journey is a most interesting one in Don Draper's universe that occupies a time (1960s) in American culture when changes occurred in warp speed. No Pollyanna view of the world, 'Mad Men' explores the full spectrum of human relationships, personality types, and emotions.",/review/rw3664662/?ref_=tt_urv

","One of the greatest shows ever made. The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Game of Thrones, Mad Men. That's it. That's the list. If you haven't watched this show you're missing one of the absolute best shows ever made. Top notch acting, costume design, writing, acting, period piece. Watch it.",/review/rw3664662/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2009,crewbie,9," Start from the beginning - you wouldn't watch a foreign film without subtitles, would you?
","The brilliance is all in the subtext. There are many hilarious moments that are only funny if you've been paying attention and understand where the character is coming from. There are also many tragic moments that would pass you by if you didn't know what came before. Many lines have double or even triple meanings. Watch this from the beginning, with a friend. Believe me, you will want to discuss each episode afterward to figure out some of the nuances of what happened.",/review/rw3664662/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2010,John_Truby,," Ambitious with good cause
","Mad Men is one of the best-written and most ambitious TV shows in some  time. It is worth close study, not just for learning how to create a  well-structured show but also how to write one that is truly original  and potentially groundbreaking.  Story world, or arena, is one of the key structural elements in any TV  drama (see the TV Drama Class for how to create this element, as well  as the other essential structural elements of a successful show). It is  where the story takes place and it usually exists within some specific  arena that not only delineates a recognizable unit but also has a set  of rules, activities and values that defines the characters.  One of the strengths of Mad Men is its story world. Instead of the  usual arena of cops, lawyers, or doctors, Mad Men takes us into a  Manhattan advertising agency in 1960. Besides being totally unique in  TV, this story world is extremely detailed. And the detailing isn't  simply a matter of the set design, which is fabulous. It is written  into every episode. The writers weave all manner of cultural icons of  the late 50s-early 60s, including TV shows, ads, and fashion.  This has two great advantages. One is the pleasure of recognition. If  you were a kid at that time, as I was, the show is a virtual time  machine. And even if you weren't, the authenticity and texture immerse  you in the world and make you feel that ""You are there!"" The other  great advantage is that this past world tricks the audience into  believing that this is how it really was back then. The first thing we  notice when we see all of these details is how much the world has  changed. Everybody smoked back then. The men were in charge and the  women were all secretaries and housewives. That sets up the kicker. By  first thinking how much we've changed, we then realize, with even more  impact, all the ways we haven't. This story, set in 1960, is really  about today, or more exactly, the ways that human nature only puts on a  new skin and the same fundamental challenges of creating a meaningful  life must be faced by each of us, every moment of every day.  Another structural element that immediately jumps out at you if you  want to create a TV show or write for one is the desire line. In Mad  Men the desire that structures each episode is fairly nebulous, and  that's probably going to cut into the show's popularity (I hope I'm  wrong on this one). Desire is the main reason almost all TV shows are  set in the cop, lawyer, and doctor arenas. These jobs give their shows  a simple and repeatable desire line that tracks the episode every week.  Catch the criminal. Win the case. Save the life. But of course this is  extremely limiting. Most people don't spend their daily lives solving  crimes, prosecuting bad guys, and saving lives.  So while the desire line on this show may be more nebulous, it is far  closer to what most Americans do in their daily lives. These Mad Men  are in the business of selling, which, as Arthur Miller pointed out  long ago, is the archetypal American action. But they aren't selling a  particular product. They're selling desire, some image of the good life  that, because it is a fabricated ideal, is always just out of reach.  Writer Matthew Weiner's brilliant conception for this show is to  connect the selling of desire to America to the personal and work lives  of the ad men themselves. The ad men want the image of the good life in  America that they are selling to be true, even if they intellectually  make fun of the poor suckers out there who buy it. Main character Don  Draper is handsome and talented, with a beautiful wife and two cute  little kids. But he has some secrets he's keeping Â– like a mistress in  the city Â– and he feels a terrible void he has no idea how to shake.  Draper is a master at manipulating desire and creating facades, so when  he tries to live the promise for real, the ""good life"" falls apart in  his hands.  We are in Far from Heaven and American Beauty territory here. And the  second episode even had Draper give his own version of the  Existentialist credo of Sartre and Camus that was seeping into pop  culture during the late 50s (how's that for a sweet detail on a TV  show?). We'll have to see whether Mad Men can extend beyond a few  episodes without imploding. Besides the lack of a clean desire line,  the subject of hollow suburban existence will make it extremely  difficult for the writers to develop the show over the long term  without beating a spiritually dead horse. In the meantime, I'm going to  sit back and enjoy some great dramatic writing, and nowadays TV is the  only place you'll find it.",/review/rw3664662/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2022,bekiwij,10," Captivating
","I loved the show. It was not the kind of show I would watch normally but I don't regret it. This show covers a lot of issues we had in the society Back in the day. How things changed ! Beauty standards. Marriage and Infidelity. Drug abuse. Smoking and drinking while pregnant. Unwanted Abandoned kids and the consequences of unnecessary social pressure to live up to the standards. Most importantly how life changes , people mature and finding the true purpose of their lives!",/review/rw3664662/?ref_=tt_urv

6 November 2022,atinkerer,9," ""You're Born Alone, And You Die Alone"" - Don Draper
","The central character in this show is a deeply damaged man called Don. He has a strong survival instinct, but he's incapable of loving or even trusting. He is running scared. He compensates for his insecurity and emptiness by pursuing primal things that soothing his ego. He has to feel that he's in control, even though he's living on the edge. He tries to be the ""Alpha Male"" conquering all around him. In reality, he is a juggler about to drop all the balls.",/review/rw3664662/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2022,ramo140,9," Interesting but flawed
",There is a lot to enjoy in the show. The main cast is amazing. Hendricks and Jones are gorgeous and steal every scene. Slattery provides a lot of great comic relief. The show is very similar to the crown in construction. Many episodes revolve around a certain event or theme. The overarching plots are meandering and leave a lot to be desired. A lot of events seem random and out of the blue. And the last chunk of episodes were extremely disappointing. The finale was just watching the characters make random decisions or enter non-sensical relationships. The middle seasons however does have stellar episodes that are worth of a rewatch.,/review/rw3664662/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,twostronghearts,10," Amazing
","Have any states yet legalized marriage between human beings and TV shows? If so, I'm going to throw a few things in a bag and run off with 'Mad Men,' the new drama on AMC set in the world of advertising at the dawn of the sixties - and encompassing New York life, and marriage, and sex, and repression, and what America was and was not. It is gorgeous in every way. As it should be - it's the spawn of all those handsome, stylish office movies that were made in the fifties. Like those movies, 'Mad Men' is smart and tremendously attractive, and it stirs you more than it probably should. It may not be deep, but if you're a certain age and have a certain sensibility and certain fantasies of what New York used to be like (thanks to those movies) it hits a deep place in you, like a straight-up Martini made of memory and desire.",/review/rw3664662/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2010,Nooshin_Navidi,9," Impeccable...
","This is a perfect show in every sense. The opening credits & animated intro are themselves works of art, and the creative direction makes the series so visually exquisite that you can't take your eyes off the screen even for a moment lest you miss one of the many perfect vignettes. The haunting opening music sets the stage for masterful sound design, ranging from each episode's musical selections to the subtlest of ambient sounds. The camera-work is nothing short of stunning; it loves each character and makes even the background action interesting. Talented cast and every character is watchable & believable.",/review/rw3664662/?ref_=tt_urv

12 August 2019,Holt344,10," One of the best drama TV-Shows in history, a piece of art
","This is truly one of the best drama series in the history of television as it has everything a drama should have: great characters and ensemble cast, superb writing, mind blowing sets and costumes. It's a character driven story that follows Don Draper and the people around him for ten years from 1960 to 1970 and the writing in these 7 seasons have been interesting and enjoyable to follow. Matthew Veiner created a piece of art with his unique and spectacular writing, mixing fiction with non fiction made him get freedom and with that he could create the many characters that the show has to offer and they are all realistic and believable characters, it's some of the best characters in a show that I've seen.",/review/rw3664662/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2018,Tweekums,10," A modern classic set in a '60s advertising agency
","Set in the changing world of advertising in the 1960s this series is centred on the employees of one agency as they work to gain new contracts and maintain the ones they have and deal with take-overs and buy-outs. There are many major characters but most important is Don Draper; a man with the magic touch in his business who is far from perfect; he cheats on his wife, drinks rather too much and has a secret that could get him in a lot of trouble if it came to light. We also have Peggy Olsen; a secretary who quickly becomes the only woman on the creative team; office manager Joan Harris; the ambitious Pete Campbell and Roger Sterling, the somewhat amoral partner with an eye for the ladies. The series doesn't only follow the characters at work; we see their home lives; Don's family, particularly his wife Betty and daughter Sally, are as important as his colleagues.",/review/rw3664662/?ref_=tt_urv
