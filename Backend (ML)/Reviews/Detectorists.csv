8 January 2023,Xstal,8," The Butchers of Buenos Aires...
","You've been tasked to prosecute the fascist junta, they've been pulled into the court from their safe bunker, air force, navy and army, assortments of corrupt parties, but you'll feel like you're the hunted, not the hunter.",/review/rw8799154/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2022,bachito1996,8," Flawless
","I've been looking forward to this film for a long time, and it doesn't disappoint at all. It's the kind of movie where the performances carry all the weight. Ricardo Darin as always was superb, but also Alejandra Flechner shines as the prosecutor's wife.",/review/rw8799154/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2022,CinemaClown,," A Vital Slice Of Argentine History
","A bracingly riveting legal drama that sheds informative light on the historic Trial of the Juntas and the painstaking work that went into its preparation, Argentina, 1985 narrates the strategy of the attorney chosen to prosecute the ones responsible for the bloodiest dictatorship in Argentine history. Smartly crafted & strongly acted, the film is engrossing for the most part yet not realised to its full potential.",/review/rw8799154/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2022,PedroPires90,8," Nunca más!
","It's not easy to talk about one of the darkest periods in Argentina's history - including torture, rapes and deaths - and to do it in an appealing way that doesn't become too heavy or exploit the victims' suffering in an abusive way. It's not easy, but they did it.",/review/rw8799154/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,rfndayitabi,9," A harrowing tale with some humour.
","Argentina, 1985 is inspired by the true story of the prosecutors Julio Strassera and Luis Moreno Ocampo, who in 1985 dared to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the bloodiest phase of the Argentine military dictatorship, which fell only 2 years earlier. Without being intimidated by the regime, the expert Strassera and the young Moreno Ocampo formed a young legal team of unlikely heroes to wage an unequal battle.",/review/rw8799154/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2022,grondonamanu,10," Nunca Más (from Argentina...)
","This is such a necessary movie because we live in a time where it seems that negationist, fascist and authoritarian speeches are in fashion. You may think that the beginning starts slow, but you must keep watching if you want to discover what's truly beautiful about Santiago Mitre's tale.",/review/rw8799154/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2022,rafaelcr44,10," Sin palabras, hermanos! Sin palabras!
","My review won't be in Spanish. One of the most famous lies people say here in Brazil is that Spanish can be easier to learn than English, as Portuguese and Spanish have the same mother language, Latin. If you want to learn a foreign language, you need to study, the last time I studied Spanish was in my 8th grade, eight years ago.",/review/rw8799154/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2022,benlenzen,8," Powerful and deep, but also funny
","The movie starts pretty slow, but from the beginning on you can connect with the characters. The first half hour or so has A LOT of funny little moments, maybe even one or two to many, considering the tone and themes of the movie, but it still works somehow, especially because the actors do a very good job(Important sidenote: I watched it in the original language with subtitles).",/review/rw8799154/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2022,grangaard-54231,9," Law and Justice is the cornerstone in a Democracy
","Great true story that highlights why it's so important to have independent courts, that can't be bullied or harassed by anti democratic forces like the military in Argentina.",/review/rw8799154/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,euroGary,8," Flawed but watchable
","I saw the British premiere of 'Argentina, 1985' at the 2022 London Film Festival. It is inspired by events following the fall of the 1976-1983 military junta that had imposed its rule on Argentina. Civilian Chief Prosecutor Julio Strassera, finding that senior lawyers are either dead, unwilling or ""super-fascist"", is forced to assemble a team of young, untried but idealistic legal staff to assist him in prosecuting military men who refuse to even recognise the authority of the civilian court. The team begins its work while coping with threats including bomb scares and bullets received through the post.",/review/rw8799154/?ref_=tt_urv

22 October 2022,gortx,," Well made and acted political courtroom drama
","The history of Argentina in the 70s and 80s was one of a constant state of civil war, often under military rule. Democracy was restored in 1983 and two years later, the Trial of the Juntas was conducted with several of the top military commanders being the defendants. Santiago Mitre's ARGENTINA, 1985 centers on the Prosecutor Julio Strassera (Ricardo Darin), who was hand-picked by the judiciary to run the case.",/review/rw8799154/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2022,alexthomaspp,8," Authentic and gripping!
",This was as near perfect as anyone could get - its a pity that we dont have such quality political-courtroom dramas in the English language. Inspired by true events - this keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire length with no let up. Acting and plot delivered completely.,/review/rw8799154/?ref_=tt_urv

2 November 2022,cohen_jack,10," I've seen it three times. It gets better every time.
","The untold story of a singular event, the prosecution of the military responsible for 30,000 disappearances in Argentina. The acting by Ricardo Darin and Andrea Flechner is flawless, and the plot is speckled with terror and humor. My wife loved it too, and it's not her type of movie. I particlarly loved the mix of footage from the real trials and the current film making. Rven the side stories about the younger prosecuting attorneys work. Even if you know the outcome of the trials, the action is riveting. If you've ever seen films based on the Dirty War, trust me, this one is different. Check it out.",/review/rw8799154/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2022,punch_p,7," Director Santiago Mitre takes a non-fussy docudrama approach and it's the right move.
","As Argentina begins reckoning with the violent torture and murder of its people by a ruthless military junta from 1976 to 1983, the task falls to prosecutor Julio Strassera (Darin) to prosecute the dictators. The constant death threats are shrugged off by his wife Silvia (Flechner) and children, and his deputy Luis (Lanzani) has no experience but a sharp mind. They assemble an unusually young team and set out to gather evidence of 709 specific crimes, representing thousands. But it seems unthinkable that these still-powerful armed forces leaders will ever be sent to prison.",/review/rw8799154/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,web-534-393830,10," Almost like a new genre
","A humorous slow burn thriller that functions as a catalyser to refresh democracy, dignity and courage, in these current communist and fascist times around the world over the last 5 years. Great cast and performance, Darin and Lansani thrust the script, tackling a delicate subject without overdoing it, without seeking too much tension nor superficiality. Almost like a new genre. This film is a critique of the current traditional system no longer trusted by over 78% of Argentines. An interesting scoop: the Argentinian government only allowed 200 theatres to show the movie. I went. The cinema laughed and roared. Massive.",/review/rw8799154/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2022,li0904426,9," ""Buenos Aires"" Trial
","The movie ""Argentina 1985"" is a beautiful movie to watch, similarly to the Nuremberg Trials, the theme is about the ""Buenos Aires"" trial where the main heads of the Argentine armed forces are put on trial for the atrocities committed during the military dictatorship that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983. The film chronicles the struggle of a lone prosecutor and his team of inexperienced lawyers in gathering evidence against the armed forces during the dictatorship even in harsh conditions of threats and time. Despite the heavy, dramatic and political theme, director Santiago Miter and his team of writers ease tensions with parallel themes: the introduction of the lawyers' families and the effects of the trial on them.",/review/rw8799154/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2022,larosafederiko,10," We needed this movie
","With so many fascists taking over the political world, it is certainly worth remind what comes along this position. Slow at times, only for sensible audience who are actually able to feel empathy. Some jokes can be a bit difficult to grasp for non-argentinians, but regardless of it, the whole thing is more than a movie: it's an experience. If you are not argentinian, please watch it with your argentinian friends (we're all over the world, in part thanks to the dictatorship fo it). If your argie friend doesn't shout, cry, applause, get angry, burst in laughter, or show any emotion, well... give her the green card already ;)",/review/rw8799154/?ref_=tt_urv

4 November 2022,QamilaFer,10," Every (at least teenager) Argentine should watch it.

26 November 2022,mipema,7," A film that can be recommended to a minimally serious audience.
","Argentina undergoes the biggest civilian trial in its history by putting in the dock the military officers who ruled the country for years, who, in their effort to subdue the guerrillas, orchestrated one of the harshest genocides in recent history: kidnappings, tortures and murders that were to go unpunished.",/review/rw8799154/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2022,vikasuniyal,10," Ricardo Darin and Juan Pedro Lanzani deliver powerful performances and message through this masterful piece of cinema
","Argentina 1985 takes you back to the times when the facists were doing what they want in the times of a dictator ruled Army era. The historic case is the core plot of the film but everything about it is beyond perfection, call it the performances by every cast, the flawless production design, cinematography or the strong dialogues delivered by these leads. This film will win Golden Globes and Oscars in the foreign film language category mark my words. Masterful mindful cinema for you in this 140 minutes of well documented history. Courtroom drama fans! Don't you dare miss this. Congratulations to the entire team in advance!",/review/rw8799154/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,samratmitrafeb14,5," A docudrama at best
",Argentina 1985 would best serve as a documentary not a film. While the script moves along and the events based on a true story unfold you realise that the film has a feel of a television miniseries. Oddly the director decided to shoot the film in 4:3 ratio to give it 'authenticity' but it feels anything but authentic in terms of the period from where the docu drama is inspired. The script is great but was the director fresh out of film school?! While the story is remarkable the film itself is instantly forgettable. Cannot recommend unlike these self proclaimed 'critics' on this website do otherwise!,/review/rw8799154/?ref_=tt_urv
