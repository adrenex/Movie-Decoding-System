22 December 2022,benjaminskylerhill,10," Yeah, it's that good.
","I did not expect the sequel to a decent spin-off Dreamworks film from over a decade ago to be one of the most poignant, introspective, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year. But here we are.",/review/rw8728900/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline. The inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the ""Shrek"" universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. He's a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land -- but he's also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. As always, the charismatic and sensitive Antonio Banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figure's suave and silly sides. ""The Last Wish"" expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the Oscar-nominated 2011 original ""Puss in Boots."" Joining Banderas and his longtime friend and co-star Salma Hayek Pinault are Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and John Mulaney, among many others. They bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. But of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercado's film. The film's aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. From the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of Puss' whiskers blowing in the wind, ""The Last Wish"" offers a variety of eye-popping details. And it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. But the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed or cloying. And the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you won't need a laser pointer or a catnip-stuffed mouse toy to entertain you.",/review/rw8728900/?ref_=tt_urv

","Puss and Boots the last wish is a fantastic sequel and inarguably better than the charming first outing. The animation is brilliant, characters are charming, pacing is tight, very funny and the action is excellent. Not to mention there is a ton of heart. If I were to nitpick I think one of the antagonists trumps the other. One is played for more comedic purposes while the other is an Intimidating physical presence for boots to contend with. The Last Wish has something for everyone and it's probably one of the better animated movies I've seen in sometime. I really don't want to get into the story to avoid spoilers because the movie was a lot of fun, and it's best to go into it fresh. If anyone is considering taking their family to see the Last Wish like I did then The Last Wish is an easy recommendation. 100% worth the money. Two thumbs up for team friendship.",/review/rw8728900/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2022,ericstevenson,10," My pick for Best Picture 2022
","The last ""Puss In Boots"" movie was made 11 years ago, as well as the last film the ""Shrek"" franchise, so surely they couldn't make something really great again, right? The story is pretty standard, as Puss In Boots is down to his last life and tries to get a wish on a magic star. It seriously has some of the best action I've seen in a long time. I don't even think this film qualifies as a comedy. It really is more like a straightforward action flick. Even its first five minutes are nothing but nonstop action from Frame 1 to Frame...whatever.",/review/rw8728900/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2022,3xHCCH,8," A Darker DreamWorks
","Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) becomes a popular folk hero in his country. After his latest conquest of a giant monster, he was killed by a freak accident with a church bell. When he woke up, Puss realized that he already spent eight of his nine lives, and that he only had one more life to live. At first he did not think it was a big deal, but a traumatic encounter with a sinister-looking Wolf (Wagner Moura) made Puss decide to retire from adventures.",/review/rw8728900/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2022,siggirules,9," Dreamworks best movie besides Shrek and How to Train your Dragon!
","I did not have many expectations going into this with my daughter, I've seen the main Shrek movies but noon of the other Puss in Boot's spin-offs. I was shocked at how good a movie this was when the credits rolled!",/review/rw8728900/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2022,Genti25,8," Not only fun, but heartfelt too.
","This is genuinely one of my favorite films of the year. I hope it gets real recognition and people don't dismiss it as ""just an animated film"".",/review/rw8728900/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2022,nicolasroop,9," Finally!! A genuinely good animated kids movie!!
","Seems that these days all the animated kids movies are more or less the same, with very few exceptions in recent years and it's grown tiresome. It's always potty humor and/or a weak storyline that either has adults rolling their eyes or falling asleep. This is one of the exceptions.",/review/rw8728900/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2022,xxaxxu,10," HOW IS THIS MOVIE THIS GOOD?!!!!
","I genuinely cannot believe I'm saying this, but this is one of the best movies of the year, so far, it's neck to neck with The Menu for me.",/review/rw8728900/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2022,ucladude1,9," unexpectedly GOOD for adults and kids
","FYI, surprisingly, kids understood jokes aimed at adults. Yes, there are spots of the movies where it's hard to know what they understand because ideas aim at us adults. But, I think the kids still understood it enjoyed the deeper parts.",/review/rw8728900/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,Avwillfan89,8," A return to form indeed.
","I was not at all interested in watching this film. As most of the animated movies from the major studios, especially from DreamWorks have been extremely dull and very samey. I can't think of a good one that I've seen since How To Train Your Dragon 2.",/review/rw8728900/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2022,pugpool10,10," A shockingly audacious film wrapped inside a seemingly familiar package

7 January 2023,Xstal,8," No Courage Without Fear...
","Poor old Puss has used up eight of his nine lives, now he's a shadow of the cat, that used to thrive, he's residing in a home, no more to dance, to fight, to roam, all the things he so enjoyed, he's now deprived. But Goldilocks, and her three bears, need Puss's claws, to get a map, that's clasped in Jack Horner's big paws, that will lead them to a star, on a journey wide and far, and a wish that gives them everything and more.",/review/rw8728900/?ref_=tt_urv

22 December 2022,FilmFanatic2023,8," A Fun and Visually Appealing Adventure
","A delightful animated film that offers fast-paced humor, elaborate visuals, and strong voice acting from a talented cast. Antonio Banderas once again brings charm and depth to the titular character, and Harvey Guillen steals the show as the sweet and enthusiastic Perrito. The dynamic between Puss, Perrito, and Kitty Softpaws (voiced by Salma Hayek Pinault) is engaging and adds substance to what could have been a purely playful endeavor. The film's anime-influenced action sequences are visually striking, and the use of dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves helps to smoothly transition between scenes. Overall, ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is a fun and visually appealing adventure that is sure to entertain audiences of all ages.",/review/rw8728900/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2022,TheZodiacDozenBooks,10," The best movie in the entire SHREK franchise!

17 December 2022,bugger-17071,10," Outstandingly good

22 December 2022,superpuckman,10," Actually a fantastic movie!
","After experiencing it on the big screen, I can say without a doubt that this movie crushes any and all other movies released this year, with the exception of the bad guys of course. This movie showed me that there is still hope in animation and DreamWorks in general, it's an experience waiting to happen, don't miss out! For you will definitely want to see this movie, the characters, the animation, the art style, and of course the story was truly remarkable! Even most of the jokes are good. Please if you are still considering it, watch this movie! It's a must watch, you and your friends will enjoy it.",/review/rw8728900/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,xkgdsrd,10," Watch out, Disney
","I can't believe how much I loved this movie, the animation, the script, the characters, the story, even the music, everything about this film is Oscar worthy. Yes, it's really that good. It's hard to believe this is a sequel to a spin-off from a franchise that already had so many movies, this film blows all of them out of the water. Yes, this movie is better than Shrek, just do yourself a favor and watch the film in theaters while it lasts, you will not regret seeing this style of animation on the big screen. My only complaint is John Mulaney was sort of distracting as a voice, I couldn't focus on the character because of the voice.",/review/rw8728900/?ref_=tt_urv
