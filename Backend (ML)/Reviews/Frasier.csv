30 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Laugh out loud funny!
","The Righteous Gemstones is truly one of the funnier shows that's came out in years! I didn't have any idea that it was going to be as funny as it was so I put off watching it and finally just caught up and I'm so glad I did. It's filled with sophomoric humor but there's so much more to this show than that. It surprisingly has a heart to this show. It gives you a hilarious look at how even religion is a business. Every cast member is hilarious but Danny McBride is the true star as he is in most things. He is incredibly underrated as a comedian. He's always a scene stealer in every movie he does and this, Eastbound & Down and Vice Principals are classic tv shows. If you're a fan of Danny McBride type comedy then this is absolutely the show for you. It will literally make you laugh out loud.",/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2020,Supermanfan-13,9," Hilarious!
",The Righteous Gemstones is flat out hilarious. It's another comedy created by the always funny Danny McBride. I'm not kidding when I say that every episode is hilarious. I've had to watch episodes twice because I was laughing so much that I missed parts. Every character on the show is funny and brings a different kind of comedy to it. HBO rarely puts out bad shows and this is no different. It's actually probably underrated. All you have to do is read through the reviews to see how much people liked this show. If you like McBride's other stuff like Eastbound and Down or Vice Principals then you'll love this too.,/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv

Everyone at the top of their game.",/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2019,UniqueParticle,10," Phenomenal show already - Maybe cause I love the cast and type!
","Every scene is great and much of it is funny! I noticed it got hate already, that's unfortunate, I love anything with Danny McBride! ""Party Man"" lol I love that line and I am excited for more of this silly show.",/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2022,lakings97,8," Funny Dark Comedy
","The Righteous Gemstones: Season 2 returns with the same cast lead by John Goodman, Danny McBride, Adam Devine, Edi Patterson, and Cassidy Freeman. This season concentrated on the backbone of Dr. Eli Gemstone who used to a wrestler with Junior Marsh played by Eric Roberts. The two helped Marsh senior to collect from those who owed him his dues. The past comes to haunt the Gemstones while Danny's character wants to expand the family business to open a resort with Eric Andre. The script is smart, dark and funny with a great cast an cameos with Jason Schwartzman, Joe Jones, and Macaulay Culkin. Culkin played Baby Billy's (Walton Goggins) neglected son who tries to make amends years later. Overall loved the series, the series has been renewed for another season on HBO.",/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2019,cartsghammond,," Very funny and smart comedy
","I've been waiting for this show ever since the sneak peak image of the cast released a couple months ago and frankly, I am not disappointed, Danny McBride is hilarious and so is the rest of the cast. There of course will be some negative reviews on here saying that it's anti Christian propaganda, but I don't see it as that at all. This is a satire on how power of any sort can be corrupted. HBO has landed another great comedy, excited to keep watching.",/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2020,RussHog,9," Funny and Moving
","This is a show about a family of preaches who preach the gospel but they sure don't live by it. The main story revolves around a blackmail scheme and the siblings (who have a love hate relationship with one another) try to save the family reputation without paying the money. Along the way, we learn about the family through flashbacks that show how they became so broken. This show has laugh too loud moments and also a lot of heart. Big props to Danny McBride!",/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2019,blanbrn,10," Laugh out loud with joy will tickle you! Excellent spin on how greed and corruption blend with religion!
","""HBO"" has just maybe been blessed with it's best comedy series of all time! Praise the new series ""The Righteous Gemstones"" which is an excellent take on how the good lord world of religion has become. It's simple the holy world is just a money making business, as the mighty dollar promotes the gospel! Growing up and as many remember and see in our own churches and little towns these things ringed so true! And this new twisted comedy series puts the spin on religion so perfect!",/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2020,smoesman,9," Simply great series!!!
","Funny, great acting from everyone involved, especially the Gemstone kids and their evil uncle are outstanding. I was waiting for a third Vice Principles season, but this series is at least as good. Love the transparent selfish characters and the great storyline. Danny McBride deverses an Emmy! Great entertainment.",/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2022,parkerposeytso,10," Amazing
","I had a co-worker tell me that he never binges anything and he binged this show, so I was like the reviews are good let give it a go... I am already deep into the second season already, this show is done so well, so good! Just watch one episode like me and you will be hooked.",/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2022,WatchAndSmile,9," For religious/Non-religous Viewers
","Religious may recognize that there's a lot of truth aside from multiplying *some* things. Nor religious can enjoy the comedy, drama and absurdity of it all.",/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2019,dan_slentz,9," Holy Mackerel... Whatta Show!!
","Incredible clever writing! Funny beyond belief. VERY well produced! And the acting is TOP NOTCH!!! John Goodman is phenomenal (and looking fit), and Danny McBride and Adam Devine are hilarious and just a hoot to watch (as is, honestly, the whole cast)! Everything about this series makes for a great show! If there's only one complaint, a half hour is NOT enough!! Awesome show!!",/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2022,kylebrown0209,8," Cool
",The show is very very hilarious If you like Danny McBride This is your kind of show It's a humorous take on a religious family I highly recommend this show.,/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2020,westsideschl,8," Season 1 - Amen
","In the beginning you see a sign posted at the entrance to the Gemstone mansion reading, ""Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven."" followed by ""No Trespassing"" - funny, haha, perhaps a sarcastic warning. As to ""poor in spirit"" the usual interpretation of ""humble"" makes no sense as a rationalization especially when compared with the more precise language in the other seven Beatitudes. Anyway, overall a humorous, tragic, and honest portrayal of human greed, etc. through the selling of forgiveness & eternity in the evangelical community.
As to the ""Gemstone"" name is it a symbolic metaphor for the value we place in dazzling, brilliant perfection as just a pretentious superficiality.",/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2019,chrisarnett-51325,8," Baby Billy!
","Baby Billy is the best character in years! The story is actually very good. The comedy (which I was thinking I may grow tired of Danny Mcbride's shtick) was so funny! Easy material to draw from, but it doesn't shame the religious viewer.",/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2021,qui_j,10," Amazing and Smart with Stellar Cast
",This is just an amazing series! It full of smart writing that has the right mix of Pathos and Comedy! Happy to see that there'll be a second season as shows like this are few and far between on TV. It truly captures the world of greed and gullibility with very human characters. It is a truly amazing and enjoyable series. Hope the second season will be as good or exceed the first!,/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2019,cherold,8," very funny take-off on megachurches
","The day before watching this series I finally watched a series about awful rich people called Succession that folks were raving about on Twitter, and didn't like it at all. The next day, coincidentally, I saw another series about awful, reasonably rich folk, The Righteous Gemstones, and it had all the fun and humor I'd been promised from Succession. From the first scene, in which a mass baptism in a swimming pool turns into a splash fight, I loved this series.",/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2019,niceguy95,10," Premiere was great!
",Fortunate enough to see premiere early. It's a winner. Not only funny but also engaging story. Danny McBride Jody Hill and David Gordon green are a dream team. Encourage everyone to watch it live each Sunday at 10 on HBO,/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2020,rdoubleoc,10," One of the best shows on TV, besides Avenue 5.
","This is definitely one of the best shows, along with Avenue 5 (Avenue 5 is my absolute favorite).",/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2020,ronbell-23984,10," Very good

25 March 2022,MickyG333,8," Rule in Hell, Gemstones...
","Preaching from charcoal podiums, rebuking with shrieks of fiery breath, and executing brimstone baptisms is what the Gemstone family would be accomplishing were they to pass abruptly into the afterlife. This is a family of pure evil, wolves in flowing white robes, hiding behind precious bling and bedazzled Bibles. The anti-christ is described as something strangely similar to Pastor Eli Gemstone (John Goodman) himself. If not for the fact they are loathsome buffoons, Eli's children, the gemstone three (Danny McBride, Edi Patterson, and Adam Devine), would probably usher in an age of darkness, and the end of protestantism as we know it.",/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
29 February 2020,joachimokeefe,8," Wickedly funny
","Imagine 'The Sopranos' as a satire on TV evangelists. John Goodman as a cynical huckster snake-oil salesman is so familiar (mainly for the Coen Bros.), you wonder if he isn't getting a little tired of the role. Danny McBride is scarily sinister as his sociopathic son, and the whole thing is a tightly put together multi-character family saga, that pulls no punches about TV evangelism.",/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2021,shaunmcevoy-98833,9," Couldn't get enough of this
","Watched the whole first season in 2 days, enjoyed it so much truly hilarious show. Danny Mcbride has made an absolute gem here pardon the pun. Walter Goggins as baby billy is the best part of this for me he's so good in this role. John Goodman giving a masterpiece in acting in ever scene. Kelvin and Keefes scenes are too funny I was in stitches. Check this one out it's an amazing show I can't wait for it to return.",/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2019,jms_mckelvey,9," Righteous Gemstones
","Love it! Been waiting for a few months to watch. It didn't disappoint. It's a caricature of these Television Televangelists. Which we've all seen through out the years. Exaggerated? Yes, but we all know they line their pockets with the weak minded. And tax free as well. I'm a big fan of Danny McBride. And I hope it gets picked up for a 2nd season.",/review/rw5071176/?ref_=tt_urv
