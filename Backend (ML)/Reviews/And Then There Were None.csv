7 October 2010,Lady_Targaryen,7," Silly British movie, but funny and with a nonsense story!
","In a Small Village, all girls that turn 18 become lesbian vampires, thanks to a curse that Camilla, a lesbian vampire queen who was defeated by Baron Wolfgang Maclaren, put in the villagers many centuries ago. In the modern days, we have Jimmy and Fletch, two friends that want to do something cool on their vacations, and decide to go on a hiking in an unknown village( that of course, is the same cursed village full of lesbians vampires).",/review/rw3161747/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2009,Otoboke,," Sharp-toothed, braindead fun.
","Okay, so, Lesbian Vampire Killers huh? Yes, I know, it sounds ludicrous, atrocious, gimmicky and gauche—but you know what? I enjoyed it. In fact, I really enjoyed it, and please bear in mind that a few readers would have you believe me to be a pompous twit. Nevermind however, because Lesbian Vampire Killers is a hoot if you're willing to simply sit back and be tickled in special areas for ninety minutes. Sure it's crude, utterly pointless and relies mostly on the humour of men drooling over breasts whilst decapitating lots of pretty strippers—but that's the point of the feature, and it's downright hilarious, fun and engaging if you're open to such stupidity. Of course, I often slam movies for being braindead and moronic, but that's only if they fail to make me giggle after the hundredth pitiful attempt at doing so. No, rather than come across as a lame Movie hybrid, Phil Claydon here manages to create a wonderfully dark comedy parody akin more to the classic Evil Dead movies spliced with a touch of Braindead and Shaun of the Dead. It's audacious, rude, blasphemous and somewhat morbidly erotic—and yet, I couldn't have been more pleased with such a piece of popcorn-trash-cinema.",/review/rw3161747/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2009,supernick-3,8," Went in for the title, went out with a smile

9 November 2011,Leofwine_draca,1," Britain's worst vampire movie, a puerile mess through and through
","Of all the lame movies made by the British film industry in the past decade, LESBIAN VAMPIRE KILLERS stands as the worst of the lot. It's a godawful wannabe comedy-horror hybrid, even worse than that film Neil Morrissey made called I BOUGHT A VAMPIRE MOTORCYCLE. Some fans of James Corden and Mathew Horne – if there are any – may get a few more chuckles out of it than I did, but I think even those with the most forgiving of temperaments are going to find this hard going.",/review/rw3161747/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2009,claudio_carvalho,6," Entertaining Silliness
","Centuries ago, Baron Wolfgang MacLaren vanquished the Vampire Queen Carmilla (Silvia Colloca) in the remote Cragwich; however, before decapitating the evil vampire, she curses the locals and descendants of the baron, swearing that every woman would turn into a lesbian vampire on the eighteenth birthday. On the present days, the clumsy and naive cuckold Jimmy (Mathew Horne) is dumped again by his girlfriend Judy (Lucy Gaskell) and misses her. His best friend Fletch (James Corden) is fired in his job of clown after hitting an annoying boy. The two friends are broken and decide to camp in the countryside to forget their problems, and Jimmy throws a dart in a map in a pub to decide where they should go. They head to Cragwich and when they arrive in the bar Baron's Rest, they see four hot girls leaving the place in a Kombi. The innkeeper offers the old Mircalla cottage in the woods for them, the same place the girls will lodge. Meanwhile, Lotte (MyAnna Buring), Heide (Tiffany Mulheron), Anke (Louise Dylan) and Trudi (Ashley Mulheron) have trouble with their van and Jimmy and Fletch reach them in the forest and they offer a ride to the guys to the cottage. They introduce themselves as students of folklore and they are researching the Vampire Queen Carmilla. When Fletch believes that he will have a night of beer and sex with three sexy girls and Jimmy and Lotte have a crush on each other, the cottage is surrounded by a group of lesbian vampires that vampires intend to use Jimmy and Lotte's blood to bring Carmilla back to life. They are abducted by the vampires, but Fletch escapes and meets Reverend Vicar (Paul McGann) that tells him that Jimmy is a descendant of the baron and only hope to stop the evil curse of Cragwich.",/review/rw3161747/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2009,nickodemos,7," Cheesy but I liked it.
",This is without a doubt a movie all teenage boys wish they could have made. Dumb without a doubt. No real worth other than cheeky humor and showing off women in a tawdry way. But come on this is what the entire movie was about.,/review/rw3161747/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2010,GrislyBloodfeast,10," I sincerely loved it
","I can't understand why this film has such low reviews. It's funny and stylish with a decent budget. I'm from the states, so I had never heard of Corden or Horne before. They made me laugh a few times, since they're professional comedians and everything, and Horne is attractive. A few people I talked to said they were disappointed the lesbianism wasn't taken farther - okay, go see a girl on girl flick. I like camp and b-films and this was definitely one of the better ones I've seen. It's actually funny and cute as all hell. I would love to see a sequel about gay werewolves starring these two but sadly, I don't think that will happen since this film wasn't a smash success. Also, as a woman, I didn't find anything terribly disgusting or cruel regarding the deaths of any of the characters...although vanquishing an ancient lesbian evil with a cock sword could been seen as offensive - whatever! It's schlock! It's fun! Calm down and laugh at the ridiculousness of it. Better than most - by a long shot.",/review/rw3161747/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2009,BA_Harrison,2," Rug-munching bloodsuckers from Norfolk.
","Obviously spurred on by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's meteoric success following their appearance in British zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead, 'Gavin & Stacey's James Corden and Mathew Horne attempt to pull off the same trick by starring in Lesbian Vampire Killers, the tale of a luckless pair of lads who find themselves neck deep in sexy vampires whilst on a hiking holiday.",/review/rw3161747/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2009,shanangus,8," What did you expect?
","This is for everyone who didn't like this movie. What did you expect. Really, what did you expect? You went to see a movie called Lesbian Vampire Killers. It had the lesbians, it had the vampires and oh yes, there were killings. Okay, it wasn't the best movie ever. The style was kind of like heroes meets sean of the dead. But it was as funny as other good comedies, it kept me entertained from start to finish mostly because of the lesbians but that's neither here nor there and although the plot was simple it was a nice idea. Essentially unless you like lesbians vampires and killings, and unless you one of those people who sees Matthew Horne throwing a sword at the bad guy who is in the middle of his two friends and think 'that doesn't make any sense he could have missed and hit James Corden, why didn't he just stab the sword' instead of thinking 'wow that was kick ass' then don't go and see this movie because you won't enjoy it.",/review/rw3161747/?ref_=tt_urv

2 April 2011,Quebec_Dragon,8," Intentionally corny title, surprisingly fun b-movie
","Beyond the obviously ridiculous title, this little British b-movie is quite above the norm. It's first and foremost a comedy with some horror elements. It has been compared to Shaun of the Dead because it's a British horror comedy yet also a buddy movie. Although Lesbian Vampire Killers (LBK) is not as good, clever or critical of society, it remains quite entertaining. I was pleasantly surprised and had a very good time watching it. LBK seems to mix in a Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen) style of directing (alternating sped up fragments of actions and slow-motion) with ""Heroes""-like captions and comic book like transitions. I found this quite dynamic and visually appealing. You don't usually notice lighting but in this one I did and found it very well done, atmospheric and at times inspired. Same thing for the musical score where it was even appropriately epic sometimes. I'm difficult yet found the script and situations more amusing than not.",/review/rw3161747/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2009,Nos51,8," Very Funny Spoof-of-a-Spoof
","The film is a continuous quote: Dracula, American Werewolf in London, Withnail and I, Ed Wood's films, Roger Corman's horror movies with Vincent Price (Paul McGann's excellent vicar's tone is very reminiscent of Price's in Corman's interpretations of Poe) and all the Hammer horrors with lesbian undertones.

11 April 2013,Hey_Sweden,7," Agreeable horror comedy.
","The danger with movies with titles like this is that sometimes the title is all you get, and the movie doesn't really deliver. Well, ""Lesbian Vampire Killers"", directed by Phil Claydon and written by Stewart Williams & Paul Hupfield, fortunately does manage to be pretty entertaining stuff, although viewers reading the title and hoping for something REALLY trashy are going to be sorely disappointed.",/review/rw3161747/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2019,bowmanblue,8," Politically incorrect fun
","Some DVDs should come with instructions. In the case of 'Lesbian Vampire Killers' such instructions should probably read: Lower IQ sufficiently then insert disc into player, sit back and enjoy. Yes, there is officially no brainpower required to get something out of this movie.",/review/rw3161747/?ref_=tt_urv

","When Jimmy is dumped by his girlfriend for the umpteenth time, he persuades his friend Fletch to join him on a hiking holiday. Arriving in a small town, they are sent to a cottage where there is free accommodation. It also happens to have a camper van full of girls staying there too!

25 March 2009,sinister_prog,1," Feeble
","Opening night at the cinema, 2 dozen people at most in it. The writers must have relied entirely on the humorous title and the fact that the two male leads are from a moderately successful British sit-com to bring the crouds in. Their character development is minimal, Try to think of ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""Withnail and I"" with all the humour taken out. Lesbianism that is just a bit of kissing and some boobie shots, and there's a bit of blood and biting for the vampire scenes. None of the characters are really likable though. Why cheer for Jimmy if all he does is stand there looking gormless all the time? Hang on, he's pretending to be Ash from the Evil Dead series.... maybe not. Fletch's character is someone who thinks 4 letter words are funny.",/review/rw3161747/?ref_=tt_urv

","Lesbian vampires' are not a new toy to ponder with, with the likes of ""Carmilla"" being written in 1872 and the first lesbian vampire to be put onto celluloid as early as 1936 with ""Dracula's Daughter"" and of course, the legend that is Hammer Horror had to play their part too.",/review/rw3161747/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2009,fembot1002,1," The only thing remotely funny about this movie is the title.
","The only thing remotely funny about this movie is the ""Lesbian Vampire Killers"" title. I don't know if they are going for campy fun or just using the title desperately to try to sway horny thirteen year old boys to rent this awful movie, but the movie is just terrible. They obviously are going for the Shaun of the Dead crowd by having British comics and replacing the zombies with vampires, but the jokes in this movie as well as all the actors/characters in it are just painful. I could barely manage to get through this travesty of a film, it was totally un-entertaining on every level imaginable. Main problem was the terrible writing with lazy, predictable, unfunny jokes, but the actors were also hammy and terrible. I can't believe anybody actually put money into making this film.",/review/rw3161747/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2009,hoodieJ,2," 90mins of nothing much really
","This film isn't intelligent (even is a cool post-modern kind of way). If you are a braying idiot who just likes base humour, you'll be in your element. It would be unfair to say this was badly acted or made. It isn't. The film is called 'Lesbian vampire killers' so the most important thing is.......it has to be FUN. This film is not. It is dull. It even fails as a party movie. When I saw this I really wanted to like it, but it's just so badly written and so misjudged that i feel kinda sorry for it. If it's aiming for tits and arse jokes, why are there barely any tits and arse? The protagonists spout blue jokes all the way through the film, but the violence is slight and childish. The lesbianism is virtually non-existent. I guess the makers were aiming for American pie meets Dracula but everything is so toned down that it becomes totally unbalanced. Like an episode of 'Goosebumps' but with two swearing cretins. Actually that description makes it sound better than it is.",/review/rw3161747/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2009,mcw6957,7," My Top Pick Of 09.
",If I had to run down the list of every movie LVK aped I would run out of space. However despite the many winks & nods LVK still manages to be top notch from start to finish. Two friends decide to go on a poor mans holiday to some quaint little backwoods English village it doesn't take long for the high camp hijinks to kick in full swing. I am an avid movie watcher but my love lies in horror. Horror & comedy don't usually work for me but that doesn't mean I don't have my favorites in that category. The last & most recent would be the criminally overlooked Poultrygeist. I think the problem is that horror comedies either fall short or just go way overboard its a delicate balance that very few can master & even those who master it once usually don't do it twice. Im looking at you Sam Rami(Evil Dead 2)Peter Jackson(Dead Alive) Lesbian Vampire Killers has it all for me continuous deadpan humor glorious sets the right amount of prosthetics fantastic makeup effects & overall just a really good sense of the macabre. LVK comes across as a studied homage to all the great horror comedies of the last 20 years or so & not just something someone threw together after watching Shaun of the Dead once or twice. I think Lesbian Vampire Killers would make a great theatrical experience around Halloween here in the states if wasn't for the dreaded bully Saw series that everyone is still so afraid to compete with. Oh well i guess those of us who loved it will have to rely on word of mouth to spread this thing around. Otherwise I have a feeling LVK will disappear into obscurity pretty fast.,/review/rw3161747/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2009,elysium36,1," Lesbian Vampire Killers... The tit all says it all!
","This film is perhaps one of the most shocking British films I have ever seen. Step aside Shaun of the Dead, a new masterpiece has hit our cinema screens, splatting against it with the velocity of a bag of blood red rotten tomatoes. Yes, another classic British comedy! Was it perhaps scripted by Oscar Wilde from beyond the grave? If so may he turn and turn again, and his shrivelled brain disolve to dust! I cannot even be bothered to discuss the plot, the acting throughout would appeal to those that like shouting ""It's behind you"" at a pantomime. If you find bodily functions amusing, then have an enema instead, and get it out of your system. If you've recently sustained a severe brain injury, you might laugh between the dribbling, but those with severe brain injuries will probably do that anyway. My advice is save your money, put it on a lame horse at a hundred to one, it will probably be a loser, but not as big a loser as this pile of mindless bile. Avoid like the plague, or in preference contract the plague, it would be more interesting experience than watching this!",/review/rw3161747/?ref_=tt_urv
