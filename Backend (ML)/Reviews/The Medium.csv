5 September 2008,fred-kolb,10," Experiencing the early 1900s with Indiana Jones!
","First of all, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank George Lucas. He has been bashed quite often, recently for the Star Wars prequels and the new Clone Wars movie, but ""The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"" is one of his greatest works ever, and even though it was never as popular as he had hoped for, he tried everything to keep the series going for as long as possible. Thank you for that! Now, don't expect something like the Indiana Jones movies when buying or renting this, because in that case, you will be disappointed. Archaeology is only featured in 2-3 episodes and there is a lot less action. But, if you are interested in seeing an exceptional TV Series, that invites you to be entertained and educated at the same time and you want enjoy a wonderful journey through the first two decades of the past century, this might be what you've been looking for.",/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2009,Adrian Sweeney,10," The best thing on TV in its day
",In fact one of the best things on television ever. The production values! The world locations! The casts! The action sequences! The star directors involved! Did George Lucas personally spend half his vast fortune providing the budgets? ,/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv

6 October 2005,sbieg-1,," A truly great TV series; should have lasted longer.....
","We are surrounded by garbage. Look at what the TV industry tries to pass off as entertainment and I think you will agree. For every quality TV show produced there are several not worth watching. One of the gems was the ""Young Indiana Jones"" series. It was funny, somewhat educational, showed historical incidents from an interesting prospective, if not always accurate  one a younger viewer would enjoy enough to watch. It was very well written and touched on the facts laid out in the movies showing Indy as a middle aged Nazi fighter. In a one-hour show we were taken on a trip from today, to a time about 90 years ago, and back to today. It showed how an incident from this long ago as meaning in today's world. A life touched during WWI can make a huge difference in what happens today. A vacation taken with Teddy Roosevelt in 1906 can be tied t things happening today in a very interesting way. I would recommend this show for anyone  all ages will enjoy this show. For a TV show the production value was very good. The world shown was as correct as possible given today's limitations. The cars were right, the clothes were correct, and the locations were beautifully filmed. For a T show this is great entertainment.",/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv

1 October 2002,Indyfan82,," Indiana Jones ROCKS!!!!
","This was one of my favorite tv series and... oh wait, it STILL is!!! Indiana Jones, whether in the movies, or on TV, ROCKS!!! The tv show had Indiana Jones meeting real life history makers and was actually quite educational, which I enjoyed.  Of course, episodes like The Treasure of the Peacock's Eye show Indy starting to get into what will become his future career - archeaology.  The episodes showing him fighting in The Great War - later known as World War I, are really cool too and really paint an accurate as possible picture of what it really was like.  It showed different events in Indy's life that shaped his values and ideas and made  him into what he is now.  Sean Patrick Flanery did a great job as Indiana Jones.  The show rules!",/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2006,mkbeck-1,10," Vote to Get Young Indiana Jones Released on DVD
","I loved the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles. They were great stories full of adventure and always related around historical events. If you are reading this and you loved it also, I have something you can do. The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles is not currently released on DVD. But there is something you can do about it. If you go to Amazon and search for the Chronicles on DVD, It will say that it is not released and has no date set. It will allow you to vote by putting in your email to receive a notice when it is released. Then see if you can get your friends to do the same. I would love to see the Adventures again, but it won't happen unless we speak up. :-)",/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2014,Vincentiu,," I love it
","a war and the roots of a hero. that could be all. but the stories, the humor, the adventure spirit, the memories about Indiana in Spielberg versions does it a rare memorable series. not exactly for details but for the state of spirit, for the inspired manner to present a grow - up, for the small pieces and, sure, for the performance of Sean Patrick Flanery. he does an admirable job and that fact is the axis of the series charm. vulnerable, courageous, naive, wise, the ideal good guy and the discoveries about himself in a delicate manner. I admit, it is one of my favorite series. it is not easy for explain but could be useful the fact than, after two decades , the memories about it remains at high level.",/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 1999,eye3,," This should be on video
",It was a ratings flop but that wasn't George Lucas' fault:  network t.v. is too small a format for the life of Indiana Jones (even if he is fictional!),/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 1999,Breaker-4,," An excellent series
","Definitely one of the best series ever put out on TV.  The historical intrigue was always interesting.  Young Jones meeting Lawrence of Arabia, Picasso, and (my favorite) a very notable young Vietnamese revolutionary always kept your interest up.  Plot lines, although sometimes a little trite,  were usually well-done and faithful to history.  Definitely a good successor to the movies with just enough action to boot.",/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2014,bluesman-20,10," The shaping of a hero..
",When I first Saw The Young Indiana Jones chronicles . I was impressed with the fact it had old Indy tell us the stories. something that has been left off the DVDs sadly. But even without old Indy. We see Henry Jones Jr. shaping into the hero he becomes. George Lucas once said he had Indy's life plotted out. And that Indiana Jones had a extraordinary life. From the Very First episode we see Young Indiana Jones strike up a life long friendship with Lawrence of Arabia. Well before fame found him. The shows introduce historical figures and Indy interacts with them. And it's a lot of fun. Lucas had Indy's life plotted out right up to the Raiders of the Lost ark. And according to him he's got it well plotted after Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Lucas carefully arranged the show to fall into three segments. 1) The Early years. Which deals with Ten year old Indy's adventures. And shows him getting all sorts of advice and we see Young Indy develop traits well know he will use. The adventures are more of a philosophical nature mostly.,/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2013,TxMike,," Young Indy finds infatuation in Ireland, but true love in London in 1916.
","I find these Young Indiana Jones movies very interesting and entertaining. Like most everyone else my introduction to Indy was via Harrison Ford and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" So now, these prequels of sorts allow us to see how young Indy at 10, traveling the world because of his dad, and young adult Indy at 22, traveling the world on his own, already was developing the characteristics we see in the Harrison Ford movies.",/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2016,Kirpianuscus,," beautiful
","I do not know the source of the fascination in this case. maybe the dose of adventure, history, a credible Sean Patrick Flanery who gives to a too well known character a sort of sensitivity, vulnerability and new nuances of courage. important is only a detail - The Young Indiana Jones Chronicle is a great series. because it has the science and art and force and precision to represent a trip in time. because the clothes and the atmosphere preserves the air of authenticity. because the humor is at right place. because it uses in smart manner the old clichés of genre. short, it is an useful, fascinating delight. and this is the only significant motif to see it.",/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2000,trcolavi,," Best TV Series
","The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles was the Best TV series ever. Each episode Indy took you into WW1. You got to see what war was really like through a soilders eyes.  Indy's adventure with the French Intelligence were always full of suspense. I was always amazed by the scenery. And could not believe that each episode was filmed on location.  By watching this series, it made me enjoy the movies so much more.  I am so happy that people who might have missed the series can get a chance to see it again on video.",/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2010,cinefreakdude,10," Great TV series!
","The adventures of young Indiana Jones is a fantastic, funny, and also educational series. I highly recommend this series to anyone, but you will like it best if you are a die hard Indyfan like myself. Corry Carrier, Sean Patrick Flannery, Ronny Coutteure, and George Hall all do a legendary job of acting! The best thing about The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles is that over the coarse of 22 episodes it really clears up Indy past and gives you the inside story about the adventures, hardships, and romances Indy went through in his years as a kid, years in WW1, and college years. There are three volumes in the series. They are, The Early Years, The War Years, an The Years of Change. The Early Years is the funniest, and probably the most heartwarming, funny and enjoyable. The War Years has the most action and tragedy. For many of the episodes I was on the edge of my seat. The Years of change is the most diplomatic, it doesn't have as must action, though certain episodes such as Treasure of the Peacocks Eye, masks of Evil, and Mystery of the Blues do. The best episode in my opinion is Mystery of the Blues because it has a cameo with Harrison Ford. The whole episode is Indy having a flash back on a memory.",/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2000,krumski,," Whose name is that in the title?
","I caught a few episodes of this on video and, while I thought the production values impressive and the action sequences fairly decent for TV, the project falters just where it needs to be the strongest: namely, in its depiction of Indiana Jones. I can't tell if it's due to the acting limitations of Sean Patrick Flanery or to George Lucas's conception of the character, but as presented here Indy is something of a bore. He is portrayed as too much the naïve and wide-eyed innocent, when what's needed is some of the humor and edginess that River Phoenix brought to the part in the beginning of ""Last Crusade."" Without a compelling lead - and one who at least has a nodding resemblance to the character we know so well from the movies - the storylines and historical backdrops just become incidental and sink from our memories without a trace.",/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2007,rwdrex,8," Unbeatable Production Values...Good TV Series Overall!
","If production values where the only standard, nothing done before or since on television can come close. Shot around the world, with a famous and would be famous international cast and crew. Giving us a fully orchestrated score, 16mm film, 100's of extras, period costuming and set design. Utilizing digital effects (when that was a brand NEW technology) for every episode. The list goes on. Come on what film/television maker or studio would ever back a project as bold and EXPENSIVE as this, except George Lucas?",/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2008,alainenglish,7," Interesting, if occasionally dull, accompaniment to the movies
","I remember the ""Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"" only very vaguely. They consisted of being largely historical, fact-based dramas rather than the knockabout adventures of the movies with Indy meeting and learning from people such as Picasso, Tolstoy and Freud. It didn't interest many people, and consequently the series never quite reached completion and many stories were never filmed.",/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2004,ubercommando,," Don't be taken in, this show is bad
","In terms of production values and what you see on screen, this show is excellent.  Lucas and Spielberg have clearly thrown money at this project and it's all up there.  Excellent cinematography, great costume and set design, some very good action scenes (the WW1 trench scenes are very well done), great use of locations but...............",/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2000,ekulp,," a brilliant portrayal of all the principle personalities of the early 20th Century
","This is a unique and brilliant piece of historiography.  Reminiscent of Upton Sinclair's Lany Budd series, but much better.  The places and people and their ideas are presented interestingly, colorfully, and authentically. Ataturk, De Gaule, Schweitzer, Mata Hari, etc., etc.---Wow! The whole thing should be on a video set and redone regularly on TV.",/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2012,pensman,3," Don't bother
","I had not seen these episodes but was familiar with Indy as a teenager so I decided to give them a go as they are currently streaming. And I know why I never watched them: boring. Correy Carrier plays the young Jones (age 10/11) as a petulant brat. All I want to do is put the kid over my knee and give him the spanking his father won't. And I suspect George Hall was picked as he could channel the clipped speech and sound of Sean Connery. It couldn't have been for acting ability. While the stories are visually beautiful, I can see where the budget went, and the inclusion of historical characters is interesting, the plots are for the most part slow and slower. Travels with Father is so bad it is a series killer. I guess if you are trapped at home in a snowstorm and there is nothing else available and there isn't a book in the house or even the back of a cereal box to read then you might consider watching these.

","Right now, this is running in the UK - and literally right now I am watching Tales of Innocence. I have seen many of them and I think they are outstanding ENTERTAINMENTS. Yes, there are clips from other action films - so what; the plots, being 'history', are predictable. Though yesterday ""Daredevil of The Desert"" was great fun. As absurd as it may sound, I have learnt interesting 'facts' - where they ARE facts - around the period of WW1. And which, I believe, is especially important these days when it seems that so many young people know so little and are more easily fed by comic films. Apart from fun, if the kids are watching this, that's a bonus! It's good photography, film work as well as being history and geography and politics. I am not someone who would care to bisect a butterfly just because you can't milk it! Mike Newman",/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2007,cosmic_quest,6," Compliments the Indy films quite well
","Perhaps my memory has blurred over the years or I'm looking upon this series from the point of the view of the child I was when I used to watch it but 'The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles' was a rather delightful television series aimed at young fans of the 'Indiana Jones' trilogy. The series focuses in on Indy at two stages of his young life. We see a pre-adolescent Indy, between the ages of around ten to twelve, living in far-flung locations as he travels with his archaeologist parents and receives his school lessons from stern but fair governess Miss Seymour. We also see Indy as in his late teens as he becomes more a man than a boy.",/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have always considered myself as an Indiana Jones fan. I first came across ""The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"" after buying the Video pack of all 3 movies. I was ""gifted"" with the ""Treasure of the Peacock's Eye"", which till the last 10 min bares significant resemblance to the classics of Indiana Jones. Then suddenly the story shifts into some 4 years old children story with extremely unsatisfying epilogue. So I decided not to look up the rest of the series. ",/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv

","Let's start out by reminding everybody that this TV series was aimed at an audience of children and young teenagers, so images of young Indy battering Nazis to the death with his bare fists wasn't part of the plan. It's totally different in tone from the films, which are intended to reprise old-time movie serials. The series is education-oriented, thus all the brushes with famous names of history. Production values ARE pretty good - it won 10 Emmys, out of 23 nominations! BUT...",/review/rw1832628/?ref_=tt_urv
