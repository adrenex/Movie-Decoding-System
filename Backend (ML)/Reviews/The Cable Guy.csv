26 March 2013,StevePulaski,8," And ""awkward"" this was
","My Awkward Sexual Adventure effectively lives up to its title, as it centers in on Jordan (Jonas Chernick), a conservative, overly-cautious accountant, who is dumped by his girlfriend Rachel (Sarah Manninen) as a response to his proposal of marriage. This comes the morning after she falls asleep while having ""sex"" with Jordan, and I abbreviate sex because it could've easily been mistaken for resuscitation. She advises that they do the good ol' ""see other people"" trick, where she can go out and have careless sex and orgies, while Jordan does, well, who cares? Jordan, who is heartbroken by her decision, wanders aimlessly throughout the cold streets, paying strippers and other local girls to pose for iPhone pictures with him to make his girlfriend green with envy. He gets bro-tips from his pal Dandak (Vik Sahay), who has been around the bend a few too many times, but gets truly vital help when he meets Julia (Emily Hampshire), a stripper who has a divine talent for culinary arts. When Jordan gets drunk out of his mind one night at the local gentlemen's club where Julia works, she graciously allows him to sleep on her couch as an act of courtesy and pity. Jordan informs her about his break-up, and Julia agrees to be his fellow ""sex Yoda,"" who coach him through the ins and outs of meeting women and the tricky art of sex.",/review/rw8398887/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2016,Dr_Sagan,," Generic RomCom. Watchable until its last 20minutes where becomes moronic.
","Most romantic comedies follow a very specific recipe and have more or less the same ingredients. By definition they have a happy ending. A few misunderstandings. A few regrets and changing of opinions. Lots of awkward moments. A best friend who is promiscuous and wants the main hero to ""go out there"". A mother who lacks understanding. Troubles at work etc. etc. etc.",/review/rw8398887/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2012,abisio,10," Best written comedy of the year
","In the first scene of ""My Awkward Sexual Adventure"" the Jordan (Jonas Chernick) is making love to his girlfriend Rachel (Sarah Manninen) in such an impassioned and mechanical way that she falls asleep (who wouldn't). The obvious break-up follows; she needs more passion and different sexual experiences. ",/review/rw8398887/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2017,keniwhat,8," Surprisingly Charming and Funny
","Two worlds bump into each other with resulting in a funny and understated comedy. A bit predictable perhaps but chances are you won't mind. You might just find yourself rooting for the characters here. As so many films nowadays contain anti-heroes and heroes that might as well be villains this film is like fresh air, despite the seediness of the setting. Book, cover, judgement: reserve.",/review/rw8398887/?ref_=tt_urv

6 April 2013,in1984,7," Awkwardly Fun
","In addition to hot chicks, it gets a point for a double-entendre in the title. There are multiple awkward adventures and the main adventurer is truly awkward. Something along the lines of a romantic comedy involving a socially awkward, insecure man, or possibly even worse, socially retarded.",/review/rw8398887/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2015,michaelradny,6," My Awkward Viewing Experience
","When you go see this film, you almost certainly know what you are going to get. However, my expectations of being low were conquered by an above average story and is decently uncliched. But my main problem with My Awkward Sexual Experience is the characters. They lean too far one way so it tries to tug at your emotional strings and this try-hard approach is too cringe worthy for a really pleasant viewing experience. ",/review/rw8398887/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2013,Robert_duder,8," A total surprise, a fun, raunchy adult comedy that Canadians can be proud of
","If you read my reviews you will know I am not a huge fan of comedies. I am VERY particular about my comedies. I am also NOT a fan of the rash of raunchy, disgusting comedies that permeate our theatres now. I can't stand the ever so popular comedians like Jonah Hill, Seth Rogen, Vince Vaughan and so on. Yelling sexual slang, body parts, fart gags and so forth are not funny...ever. However, I am also not prudish and I can handle very adult humour and content if done correctly. So I wasn't sure what to expect from My Awkward Sexual Adventure which is described as the ""funniest Canadian comedy in history."" Well to say I was pleasantly surprised is an understatement. I expected a solid 2/10 at most and that was only if I could force my way through it. What I experienced was a very adult, raunchy (but not disgusting), funny, cute, quirky love story that tries very hard. Maybe it tries just a little too hard but it is a Canadian film trying to be a mainstream blockbuster. It is the American Pie of Canadian movies and definitely for adults. The characters are not teenagers or twenty somethings being all awkward but instead middle aged adults being awkward and coming of age in their own way. Its quirky and indie and really well done.",/review/rw8398887/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2013,AvidClimber,7," My Awkward Sexual Adventure — Battling to get a sex skill upgrade
",My Awkward Sexual Adventure is about relationship obsession and sexual abilities. People tend to obsess over their relationship and screw it up because of that. This movie is a good example of that.,/review/rw8398887/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2013,lodewijkadlp,9," Subtle paradigm breaker!
",This movie is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It presents itself as the stereotypical commercial comedy. All the characters are easily understandable stereotypes. It's main storyline is basically a total cliché.,/review/rw8398887/?ref_=tt_urv

28 April 2013,daniellieparker,10," Simply Great!
","After noticing how underrated this movie was I felt compelled to write my second review, here at IMDb. This is a great movie! One of the top 5 best movies of 2012. The writer, director and cast delivered a unique fine piece of art. You will like it. Your girlfriend will love it. The harmony and balance between the characters are great. Emily Hampshire and Vik Sahay will get your attention! Jonas and Sarah were awesome as well. Even ""Naked Tom"" will make you think. Intelligent, funny and sometimes politically incorrect; all you could ever wanted to see in a comedy. If you were looking for a great Saturday night movie you definitely found one!",/review/rw8398887/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2014,bjarias,8," .. you won't forget these moments
","The only awkward part of this film is the title... all the rest is pure rom-com surprise gold. The story is nothing that unique, but still very well written and executed. What is tops is the cast, starting with the leads (and all the rest of the way through) Jonas Chernick and Emily Hampshire.. bit.ly/15IZN6Q .. not big stars by any remote movie-land standards, but here they more than hold their own. They are near flawless, and by the end you cannot see anyone else being as exceptional in their roles. She is adorable in this movie, and quite an actor. Go on twitter, look at a couple of her video interviews posted. Compare the real-life person to the one on screen in this film.. it's one impressive performance! Should you enjoy the genre, this is by far one of the better romantic comedies of the year. Be sure and watch the ending credits with 'captions on' to get all the dialogue. And good films have good music.. this closing track wraps up a very engaging film experience... bit.ly/U3EkRB",/review/rw8398887/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2013,zombiebird,3," Stupid.
","I thought this might be edgy and new, a sort of non-commercial indie masterpiece, but instead it's just a stupid frat movie. It plays up on every cliché you could think of. The plot is basically this, loser guy gets dumped by his horrible, mean girlfriend and then desperately tries to get back with her, during the course of which he meets somebody else and ends up realizing that he's in the love with her.

5 September 2013,adventurer_ci,1," A very weak film
","As much as I wanted to find something, anything worthy of watching in My Awkward Sexual Adventure (2012) movie, I could not. Never the less I finished watching this movie even though I came very close to turning off several times - I had very hard time keeping my eyes open. It's a different version of 40 year old virgin-which I hated. I would not call this movie a comedy. There is absolutely nothing funny in this movie. The performance is very, very poor, the main main character is unbelievable, no idiots like that exist in real life; his lines are so boring, made up utter nonsense. All other characters are equally unrealistic and the performances are poor.",/review/rw8398887/?ref_=tt_urv

","Nerd accountant (Jordan) gets dumped by long-term girlfriend (Rachel) for being terrible in bed, and so the terrible lover tries to win the girlfriend back by learning how to be a better lover (and also by making her jealous).

","Directed by Sean Garrity, this Canadian film made its Each Coast Premiere on the Gen-Y night party as part of the Atlanta Jewish Film Festival at Atlantic Station. This tale is about Jordan (Jonas Chernick) who has hit a road block in his love life. His girl friend notes that he is a bad lover and needs some time away. These love birds were planning a getaway trip and Jordan ventures on his own to gain insight of his best friend Dandak (Vik Sahay) who is a bit of a player in his own right. Through a series of misfortunes, Jordan befriends a stripper who promises to tutor Jordan into the mysterious ways of love. Some scenes are hilariously funny while others show case the vulnerabilities in seeking that one special person. Saw this as part of the Atlanta Jewish Film festival",/review/rw8398887/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2021,mnmajor,10," Superior to romantic comedy
","So, you see the title and the display photo... scroll past most would say. You decided to click and read it... not the best description. You watch the trailer and in the first 8 seconds you decide to stop and move on, however as you are about to hit back on your remote it captures you with a comedic scene. You keep watching and decide it looks better than it seemed. By the time you watch this (preferably with a significant other) you had low expectations and figured it would kill time. After you watch this... ""the academy award goes to"" is playing in your mind. Phenomenal. Heartwrenching. Understandably predictable. It's the story we all wish upon the stars for. The friendship, comrodery, and the truth is just surreal.",/review/rw8398887/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2013,beaudiford,9," Very Surprising
","Upon reading the synopsis for this film, I wondered if this would end up being another one of those movies with lots of boobs and no actual story line. My netflix queue was looking pretty sad, so I figured I would give MASA a chance. The awkwardness began with the very first scene. We are introduced to the feeble protagonist who verges on unlikeable. However, as the film progressed something interesting happened. I began to look forward to those awkward moments, and even started rooting for the protagonist. This film was well written, intelligent, and funny. The way the writers addressed sex was wonderful, managing to be blunt without seeming gratuitous. In addition to great writing, this film was blessed with wonderful actors. I would definitely recommend film.",/review/rw8398887/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2013,millebi-subscriptions,9," Surprisingly good Canadian film
","Reading the other reviews I see a lot of complaints about the story line and formulaic script. I, like many others, enjoyed the film because of it's honesty in attempting to portray the standard story of: Boy & Girl have problems, break up, go on a journey, attempt to get back together, and finally have an epiphany that they don't really ""belong"" together, and two of them live happily ever after. This film does that story well and what's even more surprising is that it's Canadian! I find most Canadian written stories to be very bland, tedious and downright boring, so you can imagine my surprise when I watched this film. I'm normally not a romantic comedy type of person, but this film is good enough that I will purchase a copy and it well worth watching more than once.",/review/rw8398887/?ref_=tt_urv
