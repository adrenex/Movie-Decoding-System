12 May 2018,viapetty,8," YOU CANT END IT THIS WAY
","This is a refreshingly different post-apocalyptic story. What makes it even more unique is the fact that it's a comedy. 
It takes getting used to and it marches to the beat of its own drum but quickly becomes endearing. ",/review/rw7661830/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Such an underrated comedy!
","The Last Man on Earth was such an underrated comedy that was cancelled too early. I'm glad it was able to get 4 seasons in but it needed one more to finish the story off. It sucks when shows end on a cliffhanger. It's about a cataclysm that strikes earth wiping out the entire population except for Phil Miller (Will Forte). He travels the United States, Canada and Mexican borders searching for other survivors. He ends up finding some fellow survivor and end up finding it difficult to live with other people again. What follows is an absolutely hilarious show and as always a hilarious Will Forte, who leads a pretty good cast that includes January Jones, Jason Sudeikis, Kristen Schaal, among others that are very funny in this. Give it a chance!",/review/rw7661830/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2020,Supermanfan-13,8," Incredibly Underrated!
","The Last Man on Earth was an underrated comedy that should have gotten more attention than it did when it was on. It surprised me how funny this show was. The cast is what makes this show so funny, led by the always hilarious Will Forte. Forte is funny in just about everything he does but this really is one of his best and funniest roles of his underrated career. It's easily the funniest show that's based on the apocalypse. The show is smart too, it asks us to think about some big existential questions. The first season is the best but all of them are good and worth watching. The only negative is that it ended a season too early and on a cliffhanger. That shouldn't deter you from watching it though.",/review/rw7661830/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2018,dawserouerghi,10," Season 5 pleaaaase
","The last thing you would want to hear is this show being cancelled.
I don't understand how they cancel a successful show, it doesn't make sense. 
We really need a season 5 of the last man on earth please don't cancel the show pleeaaase!",/review/rw7661830/?ref_=tt_urv

21 September 2015,dongwangfu,9," Why is this show so polarizing?
","For some reason, there are a huge number of reviews that expect this to portray all the details of its post-apocalyptic premise exactly the way each reviewer imagines it should.",/review/rw7661830/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2019,ryanskitt,10," Why did it get cancelled

17 June 2021,Pat100,6," But ruined . . .
",Lots of imaginative funny twists and good jokes. Lots of great locations and good actors. Lots of nutty silliness. The first season was good.,/review/rw7661830/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2015,rickyscouture,9," Ignore the bad reviews...This show is hilarious!
","I suppose it's expected that a show this unique is going to have its fair share of love/hate responses, but I'm extremely surprised to see it get this much criticism.",/review/rw7661830/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2020,roussou,8," Oddly funny sitcom
","This is one odd sitcom, the main characters go from one surrealistic setting to the next, mixing comedy with some real touching moments. The characters are likeable, even Tandy who seems anoying in the beginning develops into a more caring an likeable person, and every episode makes you a bit curious for the next one. If you like to relax with a bit of goofball comedy detached from your every day life this is for you. Pity it didn't have a proper 'final season'.",/review/rw7661830/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2020,hb_venus,9," PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!!
","You can't leave us all hanging like this! Season 4 has such a cliff hanger, we need to know what's going on!! This has been such a hilariously clever show, I really hope there is a way for them to make at least one more series (preferably more than one!!)",/review/rw7661830/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2018,deloudelouvain,10," I want episodes of this show every day for the rest of my life.
","The Last Man On Earth is just brilliant. One of the best comedies I've ever seen and it will be difficult to top that. I just can't get enough of it and I wished there would be an episode every day. When you see mediocre shows like The Big Bang Theory that get repeated over and over until you want to kill yourself and then there are hilarious shows like The Last Man On Earth where you have to wait patiently for an episode to come out you wonder why it's just not the opposite happening. The actors are just phenomenal in their different characters. The absolute top is Will Forte as Phil ""Tandy"" Miller. I just can't get enough of his silliness. But all the other actors are brilliant as well and all add something special to the crazy life of the last survivors on earth. You seriously have to have no sense of humor at all to not like this show. One of the best ever and hopefully with many more seasons to come.",/review/rw7661830/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2018,lesleyharris30,10," A Brilliant and Refreshing Conedy Series That Unfortunately Never got the Praise it Deserved,
","The Last Man on Earth is a phenomenal television series with immensely well written episodes, as well as an inspired and talented cast. It is one of the most refreshing comedy series I have seen in a while, as we follow a group of people in a post apocalyptic society. The show is far less about the danger surrounding them, and far more about the relationships between the characters and how they function in this new world.",/review/rw7661830/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2020,mutznuts1,10," Didn't know this existed
","Shame it ended where it did, hopefully it'll get picked back up for the final series and luckily nothing like this could happen in real life........... Oh farts",/review/rw7661830/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2015,StewartMoore,10," Hilarious, brilliant....genius.
","Astonishingly negative reviews here on IMDb for a show that is a total original, very funny and very well acted. The lead actor is such a brilliant oddball. I've watched most of season 1 and it builds very well, sustaining the development and the nightmare scenario while somehow keeping the wants of the lead out of his reach. Thwarted, might be the word. A set of circumstances that evolve in an amusing way. I can't think of a show like it. Looking back over the negative reviews here I find myself wondering if that is something to be proud of. It is far from lowest common denominator. It will likely not appeal to many, but I believe it has the makings of an underground classic.",/review/rw7661830/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2016,angeljs-1,8," Hilarious, and interesting character development
","I must admit I did binge-watch the first two seasons. The story lines are not earth-shattering, but still have you gripped, and the dialogue between the characters is sometimes very amusing.",/review/rw7661830/?ref_=tt_urv

3 March 2015,s3276169,2," If this were the last comedy on earth I'd still not watch it...
","If this were the last comedy on earth I'd still not watch it. The storyline, such it is, has seen a virus wipe out the human race. Well at least most if not all of the USA, leaving a lonely Charles Manson look alike to wander around looking for a girlfriend. ",/review/rw7661830/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2015,Rob_Taylor,3," Plagiaristic nonsense that isn't funny

17 February 2016,hjalsayegh,7," The Perfect Hatewatch!
","The series starts off on a good note, Phil Miller (played by Will Forte) is as the title tells us the last man left on the planet.",/review/rw7661830/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2022,RogerBorg,5," Too much cringe to be frothy, too unrealistic to be credible
","The basic problem here is that Will Forte wrote himself such a slimy, creepy, snivelling, irresolute character that it's impossible to empathise with him or his predicament as (not) the last man on earth. And he's not a generous writer - every scene is either featuring Phil, or talking about him.",/review/rw7661830/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2015,abondgirl,2," Hate is not a strong enough word.
","I have never written a show review before, but I was shocked by how much I actively disliked this show. Maureen's critic review on Huntington Post is absolutely perfect, in my opinion. ",/review/rw7661830/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2021,habren,10," One of the best sci fi series out there
",I love this series so much... I love how real all the characters are. In other series especially the female characters are often flat and unrealistic and based on a male fantasy of a woman instead of an actual woman.,/review/rw7661830/?ref_=tt_urv
