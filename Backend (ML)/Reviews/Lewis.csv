17 November 2004,philip_vanderveken,8," Absolutely hilarious
","After I've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times, but in it's genre it is a great movie. I know, not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like 'Robin Hood' is turned into a comedy. Many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with ... they are wrong. ",/review/rw4880489/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2006,Quinoa1984,9," this and Spaceballs are Brooks doing his best ""family"" films
","Like many a child born in the 1980's, I grew up on the Mel Brooks films that weren't necessarily the 'racier' ones like Blazing Saddles and History of the World part 1 (I saw those, of course, though not as frequently as now), but the ones meant for the ""whole family"", Spaceballs, and this film. I knew at the time I wasn't seeing great art, but just a campy, goofy, though always laugh-worthy take on Robin Hood and/or adventure movies. But calling it a family movie in quotes means that a) adults really can enjoy it as much as kids, if not more because of the little in-jokes and silly vulgarities, and b) once a kid sees it, when he revisits it, as I have a few times, it's still as fresh but with some things not quite understood the first time around. It's a comedy that is not only filled with jokes at Robin Hood movies and other movies (Godfather of course, as well as little mentions for other movies of modern times), but one that references Brooks's own movies as well; this is a filmmaker who isn't above poking fun at even his own style.",/review/rw4880489/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7," Silly but funny
","This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies, along with Spaceballs(although I will openly admit to not having watched many others, at least yet). It's very silly and thoroughly funny, there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour run-time, where you aren't entertained. Almost all of the gags have a great comical effect, few of them fall flat. I saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard, and comparing these two spoof movies, I realize exactly of how high quality this movie really is. It's funny from start to finish, none of the comedy is overdone or boring. The music is marvelous, as is the choreography of both dancing and fighting. The acting is pretty much what you would normally expect from this type of movie... Elwes is a great comedian, and makes a good Robin. The plot is typical Robin Hood, more or less everything from the legend is fit into this movie(and spoofed majorly). If you like Mel Brooks, or you're just a fan of silly humor, or you're just dying to watch a good parody of the legend of Robin Hood, this is definitely the film for you. The HBO First Look special on the film is also worth watching, and in that, you may want to keep watching throughout the credits, too. I'd recommend it to any fan of Mel Brooks movies, and to people who enjoy silly humor. 7/10",/review/rw4880489/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2005,Captain_Couth,7," Mel Brooks writer, actor and director.
",Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks. He has the assignment of spoofing the Robin Hood legacy and the couple of movie dealing with the mythical honorable thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes stars as Robin Hood. He's looking for a few good men who'll join him in his quest to topple the evil sheriff of Nottingham (Roger Rees) and win the fair hand of Maid Marian. Robin also has to deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis).as well. Tracey Ullman co-stars as Prince John's personal witch Latrine who has her eyes on the Sheriff.,/review/rw4880489/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2003,grahamsj3,7," Excellently funny!
","This is a funny film and I like it a lot. Cary Elwes plays Robin Hood to a tee. This is, of course, the usual good vs evil with Robin against the evil Sheriff of Nottingham. The humor is sort of in your face stuff for the most part, but still works well. A comedy for a night when you don't want to have to think much, it's well worth a rent!",/review/rw4880489/?ref_=tt_urv

","I remember when I first saw this movie. I was babysitting for a friend of my mums, and one of the kids suggested we watch it. Thinking it was the frankly laughable 'Prince of Thieves' they were slipping into the video recorder, I was prepared for a few hours of boredom, What I got came as a shock, a pleasant one I'll admit, but still a shock.",/review/rw4880489/?ref_=tt_urv

","Are you easily offended? You are aware that this is a Mel Brooks comedy? Someone who doesn't care about you being offended in the slightest! And while many of the jokes may feel offensive to some, he always has the heart in the right place! And yes this is a spoof of Robin Hood in general, but Kevin Costners Robin Hood in particula (early 90s).",/review/rw4880489/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2006,allenblank,," Unlike other Robin Hoods I do it with an English accent
","This was a very enjoyable spoof, but when watching it one thing stuck in my mind. It was when Robin said, ""Unlike other Robin Hoods I do it with an English accent"" which of cause was said as a joke to Kevin Cosner's ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"". But as I was thinking of other past Robin Hoods, I was reminded of two other Robin Hoods without English accents. One was Dick Gutier on a TV show called ""When Things Were Rotten"" and the other was George Segal in a TV movie called, ""The Zany Adventures of Robin Hood"". Both projects were produced by a short Jew from Brooklyn born with the name of Melvin Kaminsky. I wonder if Mel Brooks knows of this man.",/review/rw4880489/?ref_=tt_urv

2 June 2019,iguth,8," Funny and underrated
","Compare this movie to The Princess Bride or Monty Python. That is that it is funny. This movie totally takes the classic story of Robin Hood that you know and makes it into a well thought out comedy. It consistently breaks the fourth wall and is overall a well written comedy. You really do not need to even think about the plot but instead your entire attention is purely devoted to the bits within. Watch it, it's funny and is one of the better Robin Hoods.",/review/rw4880489/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2004,trulinotanother,8," Quite funny!
","Robin Hood; Men in Tights is worth watching, I recently watched it because I've just become a Cary Elwes fan, and this is one of of his lead-roles. Some moments really made me crack up so hard! I didn't expect them you know, it was so funny, Even the 2nd time around you'd still fall off your chair The cast is great, of course especially Robin of Locksley himself,Cary, but Blinkin and the Sheriff and Little John (Don't let the name fool you, it's veryy big! lol) and everyone else!",/review/rw4880489/?ref_=tt_urv

31 March 2008,Doylenf,5," Mel Brooks was sometimes funny spoofing other films...not this time...
","The humor in ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS is all on such a juvenile, potty humor level that it seems crass and coarse when applied to a legendary story like that of Robin Hood and his Merry Men. ",/review/rw4880489/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2021,Kirpianuscus,," useful
","...and smart . No doubts, a Mel Brooks comedy, with all the expected spices , jokes, allusions and ireverrency. An useful film for simple game of iconoclasm about a subject/ hero defined from romantic to heroic in so many forms. Not the last, for me it is just a joy to discover king Richard having the traits of Patrick Stuart. So, a silly comedy. Useful at whole.",/review/rw4880489/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2016,mark.waltz,3," So much talent rotting in a stew of poo.
","It's obvious that Mel Brooks' best days were behind him in this costume comedy adventure that seems to be made for 10 year old boys. Sexy Cary Elwes goes back to ""The Princess Bride"" territory and finds that he's now in a mid evil Saturday morning cartoon. With Norm Lewis as wicked King John and Roger Rees as the evil Sheriff of Rottingham, Elwes has an easy chance of defeating the bad guys. Amy Yasbeck is a rather lame Maid Marian, while Brooks' toilet humor comes to life in Tracey Ullman's hideously crude sorceress, Latrine. Cameos by various familiar faces, including Brooks himself, can't aid this from being anything more than an outrageously dumb and desperate attempt to capture the success of his '70s masterpieces.",/review/rw4880489/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2016,Horst_In_Translation,6," Solid spoof
","""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" is Academy Award winner Mel Brooks' take on the famous Robin Hood story, especially on the Kevin Costner film from shortly before. I am not too familiar with Brooks' other works, but I kinda liked these 105 minutes here. There were a handful really funny scenes and some also that were not so entertaining, just like it is the case for the majority of comedy films. Maybe it was a bit too long for its own good, but then again they may have cut some of the scenes I liked the best if they had kept this shorter. I am not really familiar with the actors in here except Richard Lewis who I knew from ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", which is usually a problem as I like seeing familiar faces, but here it worked well nonetheless.",/review/rw4880489/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2011,KnightsofNi11,3," Not even worth a chuckle
","There are reasons Mel Brooks gave up his directing career. Robin Hood: Men in Tights is one of them. From the man behind some of the greatest works of spoof comedy ever to grace the screen such as Blazing Saddles and Spaceballs comes one of the stupidest, driest, most pathetically unfunny spoofs I've ever seen. Robin Hood: Men in Tights is a spoof of the typical Robin Hood story, chock full of over the top gags that feel more like someone desperately trying to be as funny as Mel Brooks and failing miserably. It is shocking to see how someone can go from Blazing Saddles to this mess of a spoof. Why Mel Brooks? Why? A Robin Hood spoof from the king of spoofs should have been great. There is a world of possibilities when it comes to spoofing a tale as classic as Robin Hood, but this film picks from the absolute worst possibilities and floods us with terrible gags and ridiculously unfunny jokes. You know it is a problem when I literally can't refrain from voicing my opinion during the movie while I watch it alone. It basically goes like this. Robin Hood addresses a crowd and says to them, ""Gentlemen! Lend me your ears!"" The crowd then proceeds to remove their ears and throw them at Robin Hood, at which point I hang my head in shame and say out loud, ""Oh my God. Really?"" And this didn't happen once, or twice, or even three times, it happened over and over again. One bad pun after another led me to feel almost sick by the end of this movie. I laughed maybe once during the entire film, something that should not happen when watching a Mel Brooks spoof.",/review/rw4880489/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2006,RainInRivendell,10," Brilliant!
","I Love this movie! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie, but I really disagree. The comedy is classic Mel Brooks style and the actors were superbly chosen. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes, and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood mind you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as Achoo. The characters were all very well planned out and all added their own little quirks to the movie. I highly recommend that you rent this movie and enjoy it with a nice bowl of popcorn and some close friends!",/review/rw4880489/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2008,beresfordjd,1," unbelievable!!!
","I cannot believe that the same filmmaker who made the sublime Blazing Saddles, High Anxiety and Young Frankenstein could have made this piece of unfunny trash! I have tried to watch it in its entirety but have always failed because it is just too depressing. I smiled once at a Mel Brooks piece of shtick towards the end but the rest of it left me stony-faced and I wanted to love it -I truly did.Lame ideas and even lamer execution made it a torture to sit through. Mel Brooks should be ashamed of himself for this it was even worse than History of the World Part 1.It is always disappointing when one's heroes do not live up to expectations and this time Mel Brooks certainly did not.",/review/rw4880489/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2019,tbuchalski,9," Robin Hood: Men in Tights-My Good, Bad, and Ugly
","The Good:
This film is probably the last of Brooks's great comedic projects for the big screen. The over the top acting, and immature humor are trademarks of Brooks's well represented here. Similarly, Men in Tights is excessive in its self-reflexivity. None of the performances are particularly good, but each player fits perfectly in their role. Any clear star would have ruined the integrity of the comedy as the poles at genre conventions are really what generate the laughs.",/review/rw4880489/?ref_=tt_urv
