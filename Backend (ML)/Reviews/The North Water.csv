7 April 2021,Waedliman,2," Just violent
","While watching, I quickly got the feeling that this is less about a reappraisal of a true story than an orgy of violence. Add to that the tacky story with the American couple and the baby, and the typical Hollywood story was finished. Instead of dealing with the background of the crime, the film is almost exclusively dedicated to the situation in the hotel with many shootings. And that just gets on my nerves.",/review/rw4950240/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2021,lankyalun,2," A disgrace
",This was a film comprised of an hour and a half of executions by terrorists with AK47'S. Hollywood version of a real terrorist attack that should have shown a lot more respect. Subtlety is nowhere to be seen here.,/review/rw4950240/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2019,Michael Fargo,4," When is it too soon to exploit a recent tragedy?
","Throughout my life I've always been bothered by films--particularly fictional--that use historical events, like the Holocaust--to prop up an entertainment and not earning or giving the respect due to living survivors. ""Hotel Mumbai"" is a good demonstration of why it bothers me. The incident has been the subject of many documentaries that keep their distance from exploiting the sensationalism of seeing innocent people slaughtered in a mass murder. This film jumps right into the horror of the situation and never looks away at the terror and mayhem.",/review/rw4950240/?ref_=tt_urv

30 June 2019,larrys3,3," Brutally Disturbing
","This is a dramatization of the horrific terrorist attack on the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, in Mumbai in 2008, (one of 12 sites attacked on that day). In my opinion, there is way too much emphasis on the constant brutal cold blooded killings of innocent men and women throughout the movie, only occasionally relieved by the heroism of those living the nightmare inside the hotel.",/review/rw4950240/?ref_=tt_urv

The showdown takes places in the prestigious Taj Mahal Palace Hotel where personnel and guests fight for survival.",/review/rw4950240/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2019,powderuk,8," Powerful and gripping from start to finish
","This film had me hooked from the start. I recall these events playing out on Sky News, BBC, CNN etc, so I had a good understanding of what was to come. But I have to say it was brilliantly produced and acted, I felt I was there. The tension watching this film was pretty extreme, I found myself getting very angry.",/review/rw4950240/?ref_=tt_urv

","Electrifying Film !! The incredible true story of the deadly terrorist attack at Hotel in 2008 starring Dev Patel . I think this Film will be up for Best Picture this year, even with the early in year release. One of the most intense horrifiying Movies Ever . Like they say, leave the adjectives to the Critics, and there are not enough in the dictionary to describe. Its only flaw, if any is the nature of the story.",/review/rw4950240/?ref_=tt_urv

5 July 2019,hddu10-819-37458,," Typical, formulaic Hollywood revisionism
","For the true accounts of exactly what happened at Hotel Mumbai (and around the city) during the terrorist attacks, watch any one of the many documentaries available. This is just a fantasy version trying to mix ""Die Hard"" with ""hotel Rwanda"". It's bad. Of course, because it was marketed to American audiences they had to have an American protagonist who has to show an act of bravery...but not enough to actually result in anything, since that would prompt people to look him up and realize there were no Americans killed during the Hotel siege. And there has to be a ""western"" muslim to balance out the terrorists to show ""see? They're not ALL like that!"" And while this character was portrayed as a hot, rich Persian chick, the reality is she was a dumpy, old turk (and her husband); both atheists/secular who quickly pretended to be muslim (the woman put her sash around her head) to show the terrorists ""look! don't kill us! We're one of you!!!!"" and subsequently lived.",/review/rw4950240/?ref_=tt_urv

17 April 2019,ThomasDrufke,8," No Sanctuary
","Endlessly intense, emotionally charged, and meticulously crafted, Hotel Mumbai is one of the best films of 2019 so far. It reminded me of films like Zero Dark Thirty, United 93, or even Patriots Day, serving a devastating true story with powerful and unforgettable visuals amidst a truly well-written script. It's also very well directed and acted by an ensemble cast (that to their credit, doesn't feel like a cast, but more so people experiencing a stressful situation.",/review/rw4950240/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2019,eddie_baggins,7," Tense and taut, Hotel Mumbai is a gripping thriller
","It's never an easy task making a feature film of an horrific real life event, here in Hotel Mumbai the dramatization of the 2008 terror attacks that shook the country of millions and the world, but Australian director Anthony Maras manages the tricky balance of making a film that educates viewers about this terrible occurrence, while also shining a light on the many heroic actions that brought out the best of humanity in an otherwise dark and evil time.",/review/rw4950240/?ref_=tt_urv

21 June 2019,AudioFileZ,8," Excruciating Violence Creates Palpable Tension
","Ignore the negative reviews. This movie creates a horrific tension of senseless violent death dealt by brainwashed drones of a hijacked group of young zealots. It's down to good versus evil as closely to how it played out while still being a movie. It gets across the paralyzing uncertainly of those spared the initial wave of killing as to what to do next. Hotel Mumbai is a tense and excruciating emotional ride soon enough as the slow start is soon forgotten. The civilized world is far too often simply not prepared, often in a state of denial. Tragedy arrives just as shown here - and there's no do-over making this a painfully important film with a steep learning curve. I hope everyone sees this.",/review/rw4950240/?ref_=tt_urv

10 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Hotel Mumbai
","Movies like Hotel Mumbai always fascinate me because I always wonder how I would react if I was in the center of an attack. Would I keep my calm and help, or would I freak out and endanger everyone? This movie Directed by Anthony Maras, in his directorial debut, has a number of characters that grapple with that idea. Hotel Mumbai is a story about one of the locations that was attacked during the 2008 Mumbai Terrorist attacks. We learn the story of the heroic efforts of the staff of the Taj Hotel attempting to save almost 100 lives during the attack. The set up is simple, you have the calm before the storm, the attack, and the response by unassuming heroes. The execution of the direction of this movie is extremely high. The acting, the camera work, and the score were all top level and it really made this an extremely intense, but fulfilling movie. Stock Watch Stock Up - Dev Patel always is great in anything he is in: see Slumdog, or the Newsroom, or Lion. So it was no surprise to see him as the heart of this movie and carry a lot of the emotional weight of the story. He straddles the balance of helping all the victims, while simultaneously trying to make it home alive to his family. I hope he starts getting more mainstream roles because I think he is a star. He keeps his composure the entire time and keeps the audience calm in a way as well. It is really a fantastic role. Stock Neutral - Armie Hammer was as solid as he always is in his acting roles. However, he just did not have an insane amount to do in this one. Every scene he was in though was great and was brought more to life because of his presence. *A couple other tidbits - Why is Nazanin Boniadi not in more movies? She is always great in anything she is in so I hope to see her more often. - This movie is rated R for a reason, it is very intense and very graphic. Hard to watch at some points. - The villain in this was extremely creepy and has stuck with me for sure. This is a movie that is very hard to watch, but it is worth watching. These attacks were extremely disgusting acts, the acts of heroism however show the best in humanity. I am happy this movie exists and I just hope people can watch this and learn something about themselves from it",/review/rw4950240/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2019,mikialama,9," Forget the negatives! Be sure to see it!
","Can't figure out why this film has such negative reviews here! A large group of us went to see it, and afterwards, all were positively breathless and exhausted from the non-stop intensity of the film. It moved several of us to tears and we all agreed it could be an award winner! The actors, including Dev Patel, Anupam Kher, Nazanin Boniadi, Jason Issacs, Armie Hammer were excellent. There was not one moment that didn't have all riveted, both by the pathos of the individual stories as well as the excellent and effective direction of action sequences! Though not Indian, I am still well-acquainted with the fact that many films and documentaries have been made on this subject and have seen many of them. This one holds its own!
Also, having stayed in Taj properties allows one to agree that ""Guest is God"" is indeed the supreme mantra there. The true fact that over half of those who were there at Taj Palace at during the horrific attack were real-life employee heroes who stayed to help guests is a story well-worth repetition. It's also is a testament not only to the sincerity of that maxim, but to courage and determination often present in much of Indian culture in general-fierce even when pitted against insurmountable odds. Highly recommend this film, particularly for westerners new to the story.",/review/rw4950240/?ref_=tt_urv
