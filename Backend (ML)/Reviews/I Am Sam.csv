1 July 2014,CalRhys,," A Bold And Epic Exercise
","Terence Malick's existential and experimental drama is truly something special. When I first started watching the film, I was trying to figure out what Malick was aiming to portray due to the film's somewhat convoluted structure, but towards the end, I took in every aspect of the film, the themes of family, of existence, of life in general. Many see this as a hit-and-miss film, but unless you truly focus your attention, you'll miss the point it's trying to make. Is it pretentious? Indeed, but it's equally an amazing picture.",/review/rw2639485/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2011,RResende,," Rayuela
","How do you watch such a film? You've got to lower any defenses you have. You've got to not allow yourself to try to make a sense out of everything you see. You've got to take it all, and let it enter you, just as smoothly as the film enters dinosaurs, cells, planetary evolution, or a simple living room of a troubled family. Make no judgements, consider nothing except the pure experience of being there, wherever the film takes you. Search no explanation, for there was no real rational reason other than intuition for images to be as they are.",/review/rw2639485/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2011,ferguson-6,9," Nature and Grace
","Greetings again from the darkness. Rare are the times that I find myself lacking words to express my opinion on a movie just watched. But writer/director Terrence Malick does not play fair. First of all, what director makes five films in 40 years? Who makes a film about CREATION, life, evolution, spirituality, death and existence? What director seems to thrive when no real story is needed to make his points? Which director can so mess with the viewer's head through visual artistry never before seen on screen? The answer to these questions, of course, is Terrence Malick. And I hold him responsible the fact that I remain in somewhat of a semi-conscious fog four days after watching his latest masterpiece.",/review/rw2639485/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2011,Balthazar-5,10," A matchless and immensely complex vision of childhood
","The first thing to say about 'The Tree of Life' is that it is ESSENTIAL VIEWING for anyone who believes that the cinema is a great art, and an early front-runner for 'Film of the Decade'. I first heard about this project in the early 80s when the film world was awash with rumours that Malick had a project that was 'Cosmic, too cosmic even for Hollywood' (John Sayles). And, being a number one fan of Malick's magical realism, I have been metaphorically holding my breath ever since. ",/review/rw2639485/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2011,bob the moo,," Great in specific moments but ultimately doesn't come together as a whole and is surprisingly pretentious at times
","The occasional films of Terrance Malick are something that many look forward to because the man is an artist and his films are often touched with that aspect rather than being what they appear to be at first glance. I always remember how taken I was by The Thin Red Line â€“ a film I did not know was his and one I watched expecting it to be a competing film with Saving Private Ryan; I loved it and it stayed with me for some time. So I came to Tree of Life knowing what to expect (or at least knowing not to expect a ""normal"" story) and I was quite looking forward to it.",/review/rw2639485/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2012,planktonrules,3," I am obviously an idiot, as I did NOT like this film and felt it was pretentious.
","""The Tree of Life"" has won the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes and many other awards. It's also been nominated for the Best Picture Oscar--but we'll have to wait a couple weeks to find out if it wins that. If the Academy is basing the award on how pretentious and dull a film is, then the movie is a shoe-in (and with some past Best Picture winners, such as ""The Last Emperor"" and ""The English Patient"", this might just be the case). My vote is for ""Hugo"" or perhaps ""The Artist""....heck, ANY film other than ""Tree of Life""! ",/review/rw2639485/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2012,Hitchcoc,10," A Feast for the MInd, Though Not Easy
","One of the frustrating parts of writing reviews here is that there are people who, because they didn't like a movie, give it a one so its ratings will go down. No matter how much this movie eluded you (and I have sympathy for those who don't like certain types of films), to give an ambitious film like this a one is totally beyond my comprehension. You're not reviewing, you're stacking the votes and trying to punish whoever. Just the visual essence of this film should elevate it way beyond that. There's my brief diatribe. Unlike some of the viewers, I was never bored for a second. While some of the presentation was bewildering and hit-and-miss, thank God someone is doing something besides Transformers 8. This is a splendid film, filled with unanswered questions, portraying the lives of people in a whole new way. One reviewer said that this will not stand the test of time. Perhaps not, but more's the pity because we have gravitated toward judgment and the lowest common denominator. I was transfixed by the tension between Brad Pitt's father and his son. He is a failure in his own eyes and takes vengeance on his children and his wife. He had a chance to pursue his dreams as a concert pianist, but blames his family for his giving up. Children are wise and his son gets to know him. Unfortunately, he has to vent his own anger. He precariously hangs on a thread of destruction. ",/review/rw2639485/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2011,mike-3842,1," Thank god it's over... Definitely not for everybody.
","I don't expect the majority of viewers to agree with me as it already has a decent rating, but if you searched for people who hated this film then I suspect you will probably dislike it, and I am going to spare you the unfortunate experience I had of going to see it.",/review/rw2639485/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2011,chaos-rampant,," Emptying out, in search of the true face
","With Malick I usually come away with few things, simple wonderings about meaning and the desire to transcend. But there is something here worth talking about, a wondering that I believe matters. It is about the great lie upon which we have placed all our hopes and has fed us only suffering. It includes god but goes beyond, way beyond.",/review/rw2639485/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2011,tedg,," Connected Paths
","I've been studying Chinese calligraphy in the context of the cinematic life. 1300 years ago, Chinese poet-theorists had the notion that layered expression, perhaps with four layers or more, was the purest expression possible. The first of these layers come with the ideograms: you 'tell a story' using abstract pictures that reference other stories. Masters can then add several more levels in the way you draw the characters. The result is a barrage of meanings woven by emotions. Though the concepts unroll in a linear fashion, they do so with a symphony of simultaneous and referenced 'stories,' most of them working invisibly. Space, and the things unspoken are as significant as the ink you see.",/review/rw2639485/?ref_=tt_urv

30 June 2011,littlemartinarocena,10," The Tree Of Life Is A Miracle
","The film is already part of my subconscious. The pungent focus on a microscopic nucleus is as powerful as it is recognizable. The film renewed my love for film in one single viewing. It s a profoundly religious experience without being ""fundamentalist"" in any way. An artist's view made of distant memories who live in a permanent present. Brad Pitt is astonishing. That Irish-American, Catholic father from the 1950's is an X ray into something we've never seen, not on film that is. He arrives to levels of unimaginable clarity with very few words. It reminded of my father talking about his own father. I wept like a child. Jessica Chastain is also superb and the children, quite extraordinary. I can't wait to see it again.",/review/rw2639485/?ref_=tt_urv

","I couldn't believe this would happen, I'm generally respectful toward a film and try to watch till the last second to make my opinion, but this one was too much for me ... I left after 67 minutes. If a movie demands respect, it should at least respect the viewer. Basically, the first half of the movie simply didn't convince me to watch the other half.",/review/rw2639485/?ref_=tt_urv

19 May 2011,zadkine,10," Haunting
","Unlike a novel the stories in this movie do not unfold, revelation following revelation, culminating in a definable message or theme. There is no moral, no hero, no emotional epiphanies. What it presents is an extraordinarily haunting vision of childhood, how the things we love the most are as fragile as morning dew yet immensely powerful. The things that connect us, separate us, and bewilder us - again and again and again throughout our lives. The saddest, most insightful, most poignant portrayal of a family I have ever seen. Genius. How can this film achieve commercial success? it seems impossible. How did a film so ambitious get made when everything that makes money today is everything this film isn't? Bravo to the producers, bravo to the early critics who are stepping up and speaking out for this deeply moving masterpiece.",/review/rw2639485/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2011,ramair350,1," Modern art, yes. A great film, absolutely not.
","I love unconventional films. Creativity is rare, and I'm supportive of writing that is extraordinary (but not necessarily ""out of the ordinary"").

","I saw The Tree Of Life last night. Just like Sean Penn, who spends the day in the office remembering about his brothers and family, the most urgent thing I feel I have to do this morning is to write about the movie.

6 June 2011,goldwriting,1," Movie? Maybe. Art? Maybe. Pretentious? Absolutely.
","Many movies have gone down in history as pushing the envelope, changing the way critics and audiences perceive movie making as a whole. Citizen Kane, Psycho and A Clockwork Orange are only a few to raise the bar on how effective a film can be on a viewer. Sometimes those filmmakers go down in history as visionaries, decorated time and again by journalists, historians and movie fans alike, but pushing the envelope can also bring about the opposite reaction. Every now what comes along is something that few understand and even fewer care to try. For the reclusive director, Terrence Malick, he doesn't seem to care which category he falls in and maybe that's the best way to play it. He makes his movies as a personal statement and they represent exactly what he wants to say, never mind what people want to hear. Lofty and admirable as that outlook may be, it can make for an incredibly risky movie-going experience. There are already heated words being tossed all over blogs and movie sites everywhere, so here's my two cents in the debate.",/review/rw2639485/?ref_=tt_urv

8 July 2012,Buddy-51,9," Another (near) masterpiece from Malick
","Few directors have as instinctive a flair for the art of cinema as Terrance Malick, who is such a perfectionist about his work that he's managed to crank out a mere five feature films in his four decades as a filmmaker. His films are like glorious odes to nature, much in the tradition of Wordsworth and Coleridge - only, in this age of modern technology, he uses images rather than words. He makes us see the world from a whole new perspective, employing cinematography and music in much the same way as an impressionist uses paint on a canvas.",/review/rw2639485/?ref_=tt_urv
