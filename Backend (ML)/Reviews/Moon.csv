15 May 2014,gogoschka-1,," Great build-up, but...
","Remember 'Jaws'? Remember the way you only got to see little glimpses of the shark or just the remains of his victims for nearly half the movie? Instead, you got to meet half the town first and all the main characters while fear and paranoia slowly spread across the whole community, and when the great white guy finally did make his entrance - boy, what an impact he had.

","You could describe this movie as Cloverfield meets Pacific Rim, because the evil enemies of Godzilla look so much like the alien in Cloverfield, while Godzilla behaves like the monsters from Pacific Rim only now Godzilla is the good guy.",/review/rw5208802/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2014,phd_travel,10," See this on the big screen - it's worth it
",This isn't the usual kind of disaster action movie. It's a bit more serious and the disaster scenes aren't rushed. It's better to see this on a big screen because some of it is in the dark or under dusky skies.,/review/rw5208802/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2014,bob the moo,," Although effects and sound are technically impressive, it is quite unsatisfying and superficial
","I'm no great fan of summer blockbusters and for sure am resistant to the idea of paying over the odds to sit in a crowded room and be disappointed. This usually sees me picking up with such films when they are cheaper to get on rental and just watch in my own home. With Godzilla I will admit I was tempted to join for the spectacle because in addition to this the film had the appeal of quite a starry cast list in addition to being from Gareth Edwards, the man who famously made Monsters in his bedroom and on the fly. This suggested that perhaps there would be more to it than just effects and big money shots. That said, I had heard negative things and I did approach it with low expectations because after all, it is just a Godzilla movie.",/review/rw5208802/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2015,Theo Robertson,7," Satisfying Summer Blockbuster
","I saw the trailers for this a year ago while I attended a screening for Aronofsky's NOAH . I didn't fancy it much . GODZILLA conjures up memories of the big budget blandfest from a decade and a half ago . Just put some CGI on screen and voilà you've a Summer blockbuster . This version did get a very good average rating when it opened , something in the region 8.1 but progressively got lower and it now has a rating of 6.6 indicating something average . To be fair I went in with an open mind and did find myself enjoying things more than I probably expected ",/review/rw5208802/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2014,doubleb58,10," In a word...EPIC!
","I wasn't going to review this film, however, after reading mostly negative reviews, I felt I needed to put in my two cents worth. I am definitely in the minority on this one. I loved this film. It captured my attention instantly and held it for the entire two hours. Sure, the plot is familiar, but anyone who expects a new plot for one of the oldest, most famous monsters ever, is nothing but kidding themselves. This is a new version of some of the old ""Godzilla vs....."" movies. Not similar to the 1998 film in which one monster stomps around and destroys the city. Sure, that also happens here, but not without an epic battle between Godzilla and other radioactive monsters. Yes, most reviewers are complaining that Godzilla only appears for 10 minutes in the movie. This is true, as the other monsters have more screen time, but most of the film is built on suspense, and in my opinion it works very well. There is still plenty of chaos and destruction for the action buffs. The human story (about Ford Brody and his family) is quite weak and almost non-existent. But that does not take anything away from this epic monster movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it, it is VERY entertaining. 10/10",/review/rw5208802/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2021,drewnes,7," ""The arrogance of men is thinking nature is in our control and not the other way around.""
","When this came out, people were upset that it did not have enough creatures in it. I agreed back then but now after the sequels I realize that Gareth Edwards was trying to focus on the story and not just a CGI fest. I really enjoyed Bryan Cranston's character and wish I could have more of that too. While I left wanting more, sometimes that is better than having too much.",/review/rw5208802/?ref_=tt_urv

19 May 2014,Critomaton,1," Godzilla falls flat on his face, even in 3D
","Where do I begin? Nothing in this movie works. The 3D effects are the worst I've ever seen. In almost every major scene featuring the monsters, they appear completely flat and in the background, with one or two humans in the foreground in 3D. But the humans are so small (in a flawed attempt to convey the enormous scale of the monsters) that they just seem like silhouettes watching the same movie you are, as if somebody in the audience stood up to block the screen. It's almost as if the director pre-rendered the movie for Mystery Science Theater 3000... ",/review/rw5208802/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2016,alva3901,8," A great entry into the Godzilla franchise
","Godzilla has been a movie icon for over sixty years, emerging from the deep oceans and causing havoc in cities across the world. This new depiction of the great kaiju, acting as a reboot of the franchise and directed by an up-and-coming director, Gareth Edwards, is a very entertaining film despite the complaints of there being too little of Godzilla. I somewhat concur with this argument, however, having seen many of Japanese films, especially the original in 1954, it is known for Godzilla to be teased throughout the movie (or have limited screen time), yet still have a profound impact on the film and the audience it is delivered to, and this is what the 2014 version does very well. However, at times, it did come at an annoyance when right as we see him, the scene changes. But this should not take away from otherwise a really good film. ",/review/rw5208802/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2014,moviexclusive,8," Monster movies don't get any more thrilling, or pulse-pounding, or adrenaline-pumping, or jawdropping than this epic display of size and ferocity
","We don't blame the Japanese for their ambivalence towards another Hollywood rendition of 'Godzilla'; after all, Roland Emmerich did a pretty bad botched job back in 1998, treating the monster as just another creature bent on devastation and missing the point entirely why it is such an enduring icon in pop culture. And so even as some begin to diss this latest attempt at reviving the franchise by criticising it for having gotten 'fat', we don't blame the initial cynicism, especially since Hollywood already has its 'Jurassic Park', 'Cloverfield' and even last summer's 'Pacific Rim'.",/review/rw5208802/?ref_=tt_urv

28 May 2014,rasmushelms,3," A Tedious, Heartless Film
","For fans of monster movies, ""Godzilla"" was surely one of the most anticipated releases of the year.

15 May 2014,matthew-rehlinger,7," Godzilla 2014: Should You Watch It?
","Scenario 1: If you are going to see this film because you really enjoy classic Godzilla movies and you hope the music and campy theme of those films are represented in this one, you absolutely should go see it. Godzilla here looks much more like the beloved behemoth than it did in the '98 movie, the music hearkens to the classic Japanese overtures of the old Gojira film era, and the camera work has the comically silly nature of Sam Rami's Spiderman series.",/review/rw5208802/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2014,CalRhys,," An Enjoyable Action Romp That Restores The Franchise's Original Glory
","In 1998, Roland Emmerich attempted to reignite the eponymous film franchise by creating the critically-panned flop 'Godzilla', 16 years on and we are now faced with one of the best adaptations of the iconic monster's adventures. Gareth Edwards created 'Monsters' in 2010 on a mere budget of £500,000, barely 4 years on and Warner Brothers offered him the chance to create a $160 million adaptation of 'Godzilla'. All the aspects from 'Monsters' are employed in this action/sci-fi adventure, but on a much grander scale. This is a treat for all Godzilla fans and a very respectable adaptation that stays true to the 1950s Japanese classic rather than wandering away like Emmerich's one did. Packed with stunning cinematography, vast special effects and a sweeping spectacle of giant monster battles, 'Godzilla' has been a fantastic start to 2014. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Taylor-Johnson's performances are outstanding and there is a certain chemistry that makes their relationship that bit more believable. Whilst at time there are some cheesy and over-the-top scenes, 'Godzilla' is nonetheless an enjoyable action romp that restores the franchise's original glory.",/review/rw5208802/?ref_=tt_urv

30 March 2021,MlleSedTortue,7," A respectful if flawed interpretation that is nonetheless well made
","I can vividly remember the hype and anxieties surrounding Legendary making a new American Godzilla. Would they get it right? Would it be good? The result is a film that has the ingredients to be great although falls short in execution. The film's greatest success is in Godzilla's character, choosing to characterize him as a natural and eternal force of nature.

14 May 2014,BrentHankins,8," The film 'Godzilla' fans have been dreaming of.
","It's been 60 years since Godzilla first appeared on screen, emerging from the ocean to wreak havoc on the city of Tokyo. Since then, we've seen the big guy transition from antagonist to hero and back again, with the bulk of his cinematic adventures featuring battles against other gargantuan monsters. But the creature was always at his best when he was portrayed as neither hero nor villain, but a terrifying, unstoppable force of nature, which is precisely what director Gareth Edwards seeks to emulate in this highly anticipated reimagining.",/review/rw5208802/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2015,taylorkingston,4," Not as good as the 1998 version...
","I know a lot of people hated the 1998 version of Godzilla and everyone thinks this movie is amazing. Well, I don't. I personally think it's a bit of a waste of time. I don't regret watching it, but I don't think that everyone needs to see it. It's no Rambo, Die Hard, Terminator or Back To The Future. Nothing will ever top those in my book. I think the main reason I didn't like this movie a lot is because the main character dies after about thirty minutes and Godzilla isn't the main character. He's not even the main villain. He turns out to be a good guy and help the humans. What?! That's not who Godzilla is. Godzilla is a big killing machine, not a helping machine. It's just backwards.",/review/rw5208802/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2014,billygoat1071,9," The Real Deal
","This new version of Godzilla is basically Hollywood's redemption to the iconic creature after the fiasco back in 1998. To completely forget that awful remake, it goes back to the classic design of the monster, takes a more atmospheric tone, and stripping off the worst parts (mostly the bad humor) of the abomination. The achievement here is rather astounding. It's not the typical type of action movie that most of the time shoves the large scale destruction to the audience. It instead prioritizes the tension which becomes a totally breathtaking experience. Though, there are parts of the story that deserve a little more exploration to make it an ultimately compelling blockbuster, but then it's already compelling when it features the terror and the largeness of this awesome monster.",/review/rw5208802/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2014,Dory_Darko,7," Form over function Once again.
","OK, let me start off by saying that the new Godzilla is definitely an entertaining movie and well worth the price of an admission ticket. That is – so long as you go into it with popcorn-level expectations. Now, it has to be said that the bar, since the most recent attempt by Roland Emmerich in 1998 (which was hilarious at best) wasn't set particularly high, to say it nicely. So in all honesty, with today's budget and special effects, it never had a big chance of being that bad. But I have to admit, judging from the trailer – I thought it would be better.",/review/rw5208802/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2021,theoledoux,8," Very good monster movie!
","My first Godzilla experience. I've never been a huge fan of monster movies but this was good for multiple reasons. Awesome special effects, good cinematography, amazing sound design, decent story and okay characters (for the most part). It sucks that Bryan Cranston didn't have a bigger part in this. He's a great actor.",/review/rw5208802/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2014,zetes,6," The monster action is fun, but, overall, it's a disappointment
","Oh, the trailers looked so good. I had hope, and, for the most part, my only criterion was that it be better than Pacific Rim, Hollywood's attempt at the kaiju genre last year. I liked that one, but was disappointed (with Guillermo del Toro, I expected something with a little more meat). Godzilla does not clear that hurdle. It has the same major problem that all these kinds of films do: the human element is lacking. Severely here. And what a fantastic cast to waste! Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn, Elizabeth Olsen, Ken Watanabe! Every single one of them utterly wasted. Hopefully they all got a big check. We have all these people, but instead we're saddled with charisma black hole Aaron Taylor-Johnson (of Kick-Ass fame), who isn't even adequate. Thankfully, the big monster fights deliver, for the most part. There could maybe be more monster action, but when it's there, it's a lot of fun. I also thank the filmmakers for restraining themselves and keeping the film at only two hours (it runs a tad over that if you stay through the credits).",/review/rw5208802/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2014,SnoopyStyle,6," monster movie better than the human story
","During the 1950s, creatures are awaken from the deepest depths. Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) believes that ancient creatures exist that lives in radiation. As the radiation faded from the earth's surface, these creatures retreated to the lower depths. In 1999, miners uncover a vast cavern with a giant skeleton in the Philippines. They also find one of the spores broken open. In Japan at the Janjira Nuclear Power Plant, manager Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) loses his wife in a freak incident. Fifteen years later, Joe is still investigating the incident with the city around the plant quarantined. He is arrested once again for trying to breach the quarantine. His son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has to leave behind his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) in San Francisco to go pick him up from jail in Japan. Joe convinces Ford who is now a US Navy ordnance disposal officer to join him to go to the plant. They discover that there is no radiation leak. Instead the spore from the Philippines named MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) has settled in the plant sucking up all the radiation.",/review/rw5208802/?ref_=tt_urv

","I found the acting to be mostly good through the movie considered what the actors had to work with. The same goes for the fighting scenes between the monsters, the music and the special effects. But when it comes to the script, more or less the basis for the entire movie, it was so bad that it ruined the entire movie!",/review/rw5208802/?ref_=tt_urv
