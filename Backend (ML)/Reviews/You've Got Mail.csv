2 October 2020,nikthefreak,6," Good start,ridiculous ending
","The first episodes are good,but the things go wrong with the last episodes.
The story with Sol is exhausting and the scenario become very problematic.
The last episode is totally crazy.
The series lost its purpose and lost a big opportunity to become a good series overall.",/review/rw7971933/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Good Sci-fi Series!
","All I can say about Raised by Wolves is Wow...what an awesome show! It really is one of the better new sci-fi shows to come out in a long time. It's about the world being torn apart by humans because of religious belief differences. Two androids are then tasked with taking and raising human children on a mysterious unknown planet. The acting, writing, directing, cinematography, etc., etc. Are all amazing! Ridley Scott is the executive producer with Travis Fimmel as the lead, if that right there doesn't make you want to see this then I don't know what will? It just got canceled because of how expensive the show is to make so it's only two seasons long. If you're a fan of sci-fi then give this show a chance. You won't be disappointed.",/review/rw7971933/?ref_=tt_urv

24 October 2020,nancyldraper,9," A Feast for cerebral SciFi fans
","This is a feast if you are a cerebral SciFi fan (attested by the many YouTube videos dedicated to explaining it). It has an intelligent premise. The casting is perfect (Amanda Collins owns the screen) and the performances are nuanced. The locations are eerie and very otherworldly. The tension is well calibrated and the mystery is complex and haunting. Two warnings: don't watch this if you have a snake phobia and don't expect the season to resolve the mystery (the season finale actually leaves us with more questions than answers) but I think you, like I, will be left with a hunger for more. I give this series a 9 (superb) out of 10 {SciFi Thriller}",/review/rw7971933/?ref_=tt_urv

17 November 2020,Mcduff3601,8," Was pleasantly surprised by this great sci fi show
",I didn't know much about this going in and only found out it was made by Ridley Scott after I saw the first robot bleeding. I am glad I didn't know it was from Ridley Scott I feel like I enjoyed it more with anticipating any kind of tie in to one of the best sci fi franchises out there.,/review/rw7971933/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2020,neilbrown-40938,6," Started so well and then ..... oh dear
","I love sci fi. I love aliens. I love ridley. And I love anti religion series that make you think. It started so well but by the end I was left confused where it was going. And then the finale. Man, I had to look at reviews to understand what the hell happened. The androids are great - really stole the show. The kids less so. Travis is just Ragnar in space. Such a shame that the ahow started so well and ended in a mess.",/review/rw7971933/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2020,ryantheologo,5," So much potential, but lost its way
","This show really had the opportunity to make something great, unfortunately it got let down by the writing the further along it went. the cinematography and acting is first rate. The ending feels rushed and scattered, it doesn't make sense, the gaping holes in the plot, all conspired to ruin the show for me from about episode 5 onwards.Its worth a watch but prepare to be let down.",/review/rw7971933/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2020,Acid_Reflex,7," All over the place
","Without creating spoilers, I would say this series starts out really strong and then gets really silly by the end with the characters becoming just stupid enough to keep the series going to an even sillier somewhat cliffhanger ending.",/review/rw7971933/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2020,deijmaster-49968,4," Great start but boy does it go anywhere.
","Excited at the beginning of the series, but as episodes came endless conversations slowly but surely brought the whole thing down. Depressing environment, boring conversations and characters you care less about as time passes are really the weakest points.",/review/rw7971933/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2021,ronbell-23984,9," Very good
","Excellent Sci Fi I really enjoyed this. The actings good and overall the show is not predictable. A good watch, I am looking forward to the second season.",/review/rw7971933/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2020,yoyopa,5," It started off good...
",The international symbol for a movie or tv show sucking is absentmindedly reaching for your phone and scrolling through social media without even realizing it.,/review/rw7971933/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2020,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,8," Real Sci-Fi
","Whoa! Real science fiction on TV, It seems like ages since I've seen genuine sci-fi and this certainly fits. I love the retro Fritz Lang's Metropolis 1920-30s scifi feel of it too. Can't wait for season 2. This show is rewatchable. I don't think you can get everything about it in one binge because it has lots of subtle ideas about religion, atheism and humanity. Very thought provoking. I hope when season 2 comes out HBO finally has both seasons in Dolby Vision HDR by then.",/review/rw7971933/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2020,lghedges,9," It's Weird. I like that.
","Cinematography is great. Music is great. Acting is pretty good. Story is weird. And I mean it's weird to the point where it's original and not disturbing. It's really good if you want an original sci-fi that has un original characters. We have had robots, we have had alien monsters, we have had religion vs non religion and we have had other worldly planets. But Raised By Wolves has that all in one and it works!",/review/rw7971933/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2020,robfollower,9," Raised by Wolves(2020-)
","""Raised by Wolves"" is the type of sci-fi project that deserves some respect for its ambition alone-whatever you feel from it, you have to admire its full commitment to its Biblical proportions, and the way that it uses its androids and killers to tell a story about faith and parenting. Ridley Scott directed the first two episodes of the series, and using his name as part of the marketing is a fair move (even if it was created by Aaron Guzikowski, who wrote ""Prisoners."") This space oddity is very much of Scott's more exploratory, and out-there stories, like settling into Scott's ""Prometheus"" for the first time. And like that film, ""Raised by Wolves"" could inspire a lot of conversation, and it just as similarly could inspire people to write it off.",/review/rw7971933/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2022,FA-BWP,8," Why can't they conclude a decent plot?
",Raised by Wolves has interesting plot. Second season has good story but lot of stuff left for next season in the last episode. Now we are told that the show has been cancelled.,/review/rw7971933/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2020,amesmonde,," Creepy, edgy, science fiction at its best
","Androids Mother and Father flee Earth to settle on the planet Kepler-22b. However, when their mission doesn't go as planned, Mother shows that she is not the same as Father when confronted with threats - both human and unhuman.",/review/rw7971933/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2020,dogonlion,3," Not as good as it could have been
","This show started well with a good idea. By the 7th episode it gets ridiculous fast. It shows the limits of human imagination. The story is supposed to take place in a dystopian future but it feels like present days. Maybe we should stop imagining dystopian futures. Their idea of fixing an elaborate android is by transfusions of liquids via tubes. You can fix another one by sliding your finger on a wound on the android's hand and entering a password (the wound will magically heal late). Voila! And oh, the ""female"" Android gets pregnant by means it does not comprehend itself. Whatever! This is too easy. Travis Fimmel still thinks he's in his Viking's Ragnar character.
I gave it 3 stars for the beautiful South African landscape and the first 2 episodes directed by Ridley Scott.
I'm watching the 8th episode and I'm so bored. None of the themes they brought up in the first episodes are leading anywhere. The writers became entangled with an idea that was too big for them.",/review/rw7971933/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2020,kierran89,6," Something original during an era of remakes and repetitive storylines
","If, like me, you've been looking for something truly original and thought-provoking, this is the show for you.",/review/rw7971933/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2020,Tweetienator,5," Nice Trip
","In its best moments Raised by Wolves tastes to me a little like some of those sci-fi (comic) stories forged by Alejandro Jodorowsky, Enki Bilal or Moebius and other European writers. What we get is a weird future dystopian world in which two androids, called Father and Mother, raise some human children on a far away and uninhabited planet after a great war on Earth.",/review/rw7971933/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2020,b4blue,10," Polarizing, depolarizing, relax and enjoy
","At first I was like ""this is some atheist propaganda"", then ""this is some religious propaganda"", but then I realized it challenges hard core people on all sides and tells a completely separate story.",/review/rw7971933/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2020,krbodkin,3," Really?
",Gets dumber with every episode. The fact that it's sitting at an 8.6 is unfathomable. Nothing happens. No development and minimal plot.,/review/rw7971933/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2022,brett-76260,9," Strange but solid
",Overall the show is entertaining and keeps you interested. It's a tick strange at times no question about it but overall is solid. I will say Amanda Collin is freakin outstanding in her role. She has that role down to a complete masterpiece. The way she moves and her facial expressions are so spot on. Same goes for Abubakar Salim. Her plays an android absolutely perfect. Say what you want about the script but there is no denying the casting director hit a home run on the main characters. The show is worth watching based on the acting alone. You need to give it at least 3 episodes before making any conclusions to the show. Amanda and Abubakar??? Crikey both crazy talented.,/review/rw7971933/?ref_=tt_urv
