25 August 2021,gortx,," Even lesser Ozon is still worth exploring
","Fine French filmmaker Francois Ozon (SWIMMING POOL) in a lower gear but still not without interest. As the title and poster may indicate, this is a memory film. A story about a fateful summer and a relationship that changes everything in a young person's life. Looks can be a bit deceiving, however, as there is more than hazy lazy nostalgia at play.",/review/rw7609417/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2020,AppleEye2U,8," Sexy & Nostalgic Gloom & Doom Boys Love
","Such a pity this movie is released during corona. Été 85 deserves worldwide recognition and rewards like Call Me By Your Name. It is said director Francois Ozon was inspired by this movie to make his own version, set in 1985, when he turned 18 in France.",/review/rw7609417/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2020,MarcoParzivalRocha,7," Summer love is always a painful love
","Normandy, 1985. Alexis and David begin an unlikely friendship after an incident at sea. The story telling is interesting, François Ozon style, the typical plot to appeal for feelings and emotions, but that sometimes (as is the case in this film) falls too much into the melodramatic. There's nothing mind blowing, or double-sided characters, it is a simple summer love story, where there's a side of innocence and illusion about the first love to contrast with a rebellious and non-conformist side, of fleeting relationships. The aesthetics and sonority perfectly captures the 80's vibe, in a fantastic 16mm film. Those who liked 'Call Me by Your Name' will certainly like 'Été 85', given the similarities and inspirations that the director sought after Luca Guadagnino's great success. The protagonists have talent, and above all, chemistry, essential for a film of this kind to work. It's a nice way to end the (strange) summer of 2020.",/review/rw7609417/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2020,scotartsproduction,9," Thankfully, some people still make films like this
","Thanks to Ozon for making something that leaves typical McHollywood LA tropes in the dirt. Most gay films pals in comparison. Why? A story, well written story, dedicate visionaries, and actors. This is what cereative cinema is all about. Sure, we've seen the summer romances, and this film certainly does not do anything new in that respect - however that is the point, The skill to present this as an acceptable love affair, with a good twist, is why it's stronger than most. Summer of 85 brings in everything but the kitchen sink from literate queerdom: young romance, Verlaine, Rimbaud, eager French-isms in tragedy, and steamy sensuality. But it's also what Ozon left out: tired politics, rah-rah Pink parade tropes, and endless rants on victimhood. These are boys, who fell in love, and there's a reasonably believable story about them - apparently rooted in a real life saga of a similar situation, found in British newspapers decades ago. My only criticism is, the film could have used a deeper delve into New Romanticism of the 80s - if you're going to do The Cure - go deeper. Rimbaud was a very bad boy, Alex is not 'bad' he's consumed with passion. Slightly more stylized and slightly less topical. That said, this movie is a great watch, I'll see it in cinema post-covid, and highly recommend. Thank God someone is making things like this!

20 April 2021,laduqesa,8," Summer lovin', had me a blast. Summer lovin', happened so fast
",The boys meet while separately out boating and sixteen year old Alexis falls in love immediately with eighteen year old David. We know from the start that the relationship is doomed but we obviously don't know how and why. Hints and fragments emerge from the text - and it is a text. Alex is writing the events of the six week romance as a way of explaining his criminal actions to a social worker.,/review/rw7609417/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2020,imdb-jeroen,9," Unsurprising story elaborated surprisingly beautiful
","I've seen a lot of 'gay' movies and a lot of coming of age movies and a lot of movies that combine both, but it is rare to see this in such great quality. The story hasn't many surprising twists, but the movie doesn't need those. It is a story of all times, metoculously set in one specific time and told in a very skillfull and loving fashion.",/review/rw7609417/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2020,jadavix,5," Undercooked, pseudo-tragic love story does not deliver beyond one extraordinary scene
","I wonder if Francois Ozon has lost his touch a little bit. This is the guy who made riveting, distressing, transgressive films like ""Sitcom"" and ""Criminal Lovers"". While he still has the ability to shock by showing you something different, I thought ""Double Lover"" was a tedious story aside from such moments, and the same has to be said for ""Ete 85"".",/review/rw7609417/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2020,chong_an,8," Beautifully shot summer love
","In the title summer, on a beach town, two teenage boys meet while sailing and fall in love. The story is told mostly by way of an essay that recounts the events of the summer, which allows for selective disclosures (or not). Right at the start of the film, we know something bad has happened, but it takes most of the movie to find out what and why.",/review/rw7609417/?ref_=tt_urv

","What do you dream of when you're 16-years-old and in a seaside resort in Normandy in the 1980s? A best friend? A lifelong teen pact? Scooting off on adventures on a boat or a motorbike? Living life at breakneck speed? No. You dream of death. Because you can't get a bigger kick than dying. And that's why you save it till the very end.

Wnen he goes out sailing, he capsizes and almost drowns, but is rescued by David, 18. They strike up an immediate friendship and start hanging out together.

20 October 2020,jromanbaker,9," Love story ?
","This sometimes moving film directed by Francois Ozon alternated between the growing intensity of relationship between two youths with ( to me ) distressing images of a corpse in a morgue, a profanation of a grave and morbid reflections on death. I have not read the novel upon which the film is based to see how much the source material remains. The book is set in the UK and I wondered while watching it if the film would have worked better for me if it had been set there. There seemed a strange disjunction between a sort of British sensibility and the French language and the cliff situated town which reminded me of the Sussex Cliffs. Both Felix Lefebvre and Benjamin Voisin played their roles well as the two youths, plus an excellent supporting cast. But the feel of a love story I did not get but more of a Proustian ' obsession ' which masks itself as love. There are words towards the end which support this hypothesis about how we ' invent the people we love '. To sum up it is a darkly romantic film, and I do not think the poster fits the subject matter. It is certainly one of Ozon's best films, but its over morbid content held me back from total liking. As we live in subjectivity other reviewers will have a different impression and quite rightly so.",/review/rw7609417/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2020,schorschi100,5," A teen love story with too much drama but not enough development
","I decided to watch the movie with mixed feelings. The plot seemed not intriguing enough, but Ozon's name is (or at least was) a certain guarantee. Alas, the disappointment prevailed. In 8 femmes, Ozon managed to keep an unforgiving and at the same time uncommenting eye into the human behavior. The behavior itself developed the characters, and brought them together into a whole. Eté 85 is a mixture of Ozon and a try to mimic Almadóvar's way of looking into tragedy, which unfortunately fails completely. The scenes are great, the actors true to their characters, but what comes out is a story swaying between a kitsch gay teenagers' love affair and a family drama. The ending is weird (I am referring to the court sentence), taking into account the fact that the subject of homosexuality was at the time socially unacceptable was extremely poorly part of the story to that point, with the exception of a vague reference to an uncle). None of the three main characters (Alexis, David and the mother, Mme Gorman) develop and their reactions throughout the film are irrational, somewhere between funny and stupid, in a combination which simply does not work. Kate's acting is miserable, same as Alexis' parents. The only convincing character, if any, is probably the social worker.",/review/rw7609417/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2020,Sir_AmirSyarif,4," An embarrassing misfire
","It's impossible not to be wowed by the sheer visual beauty of this film. François Ozon's 'Summer of 85' looks gorgeous but, unfortunately, not quite good enough to completely save it from its plodding plot with flat, annoying characters. An embarrassing misfire.",/review/rw7609417/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2021,johannes2000-1,9," An endearing and very well acted gay summer-love story.
","This endearing love-story is pictured from the point of view of 16 year old naive and impressionable Alex, who head over heals falls in love with the more streetwise and impetuous David. Ozon very convincingly shows the kind of summer-love that many of us are all too familiar with, at the start looking like it will last forever, until somewhere along the line one of the two backs out, leaving the other broken-hearted.",/review/rw7609417/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2021,baileycrawly,10," Painful, Poignant, Perfect
","Summer of 85 is a fantastic film no matter how you look at it. It's shot on film that displays the grain reminiscent of a film that came right out of the summer of 1985; the cinematography is absolutely beautiful; the story is paced perfectly; the acting is absolutely stellar (having had little exposure to French-language films over the years, none of the actors were recognizable, which helped to sell the story that much more, and every single one of them was incredible); the romantic chemistry between the characters was beautifully effective and it conveyed every bit of sexual tension without actually showing anything particularly graphic. Even through reading subtitles, the film stirred strong emotion and showcased the beauty and tragedy of young love and the fragility and unpredictability of our own lives.
The soundtrack is also phenomenal, but the biggest emotional impact revolves around the Rod Stewart song ""Sailing,"" which I will never again be able to listen to without crying.
The only singular downside to the film is the creepy mother character, which is something you'll notice in the first 15 minutes of the film. I don't particularly understand the significance of having the character be the way she is as it's quite off-putting, but it's easily overshadowed by a beautiful on-screen romance and tragedy. Definitely headed to my Top 10 list.",/review/rw7609417/?ref_=tt_urv

24 April 2021,frosk-71966,," One major subtitle fail
","Toward the end of the movie, Alexis asks the teacher a question about David, which is subtitled: ""Did he seduce you, too?"" The teacher replies something like: ""Yes, but he was my student, and I was his teacher."" This is confusing to an English speaker, because the teacher seems at once to be admitting to and denying a physical relationship with David. The confusion is owing to the subtitles. In French the verb Alexis uses is séduire, which can mean seduce. But it can also mean.attract, charm, allure, beguile, etc. From the teacher's answer, it's clear that the subtitle should use one of these words, and not seduce, because the point is that while David charmed the teacher, and perhaps tried actively to seduce him, he did not succeed.",/review/rw7609417/?ref_=tt_urv
