20 March 2021,paypal-57499,6," Well worth a watch, but look up the real story
","As many have noticed, this story takes the ""inspired by true events"" a bit too far on occasions. But still I recommend watching it as it gives another side of the grim events more than 70 years ago. I find the acting credible and good but as said.. the historical correctness is highly questionable.",/review/rw7087876/?ref_=tt_urv

26 May 2021,jlischka,6," Reviewers should get their facts right before they comment
","The historical accuracy of Atlantic Crossing is debatable but comments that there was no TV in the U. S. in 1939 and 1940 are dead wrong. During the 1939 World's Fair David Sarnoff, president of RCA, unveiled the first commercial publicly accessible television broadcast. I know because I was there. During the opening ceremonies of the Fair on April 30th, FDR became the first president to be televised. TV sets went on sale to the public the next day and were featured in NYC store windows.",/review/rw7087876/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2021,chalaowens,5," Wasted Opportunities
","This could have been a masterpiece of historical storytelling with a script that focused on the Norwegian peoples' suffering under Hitler and the Royal family's many efforts to free them. But after the first riveting episode, the script becomes stuck inside Sweden's politics, Buckingham Palace and Washington DC with boring storylines that go nowhere. Honestly, I was insulted for the brave Norwegians and their Royal Family. They deserved far better, especially from Masterpiece Theater.",/review/rw7087876/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2021,private-90505,2," World War II retold as a tabloid romance novel
","What are the limits to the catchphrase, ""Based on true events""? Cardboard characters with historically-inaccurate personae (Eleanor Roosevelt, to name but one) render ""Atlantic Crossing"" as a pulp romance that fails to honestly document Norway's royal family during the war years.",/review/rw7087876/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2021,scotkroozr,," 'Glitch' in historical accuracy
","This may strike other viewers as trivial nitpicking...but it made me wonder how careful the series makers were about other matters. Episode 3 has Norway's U. S. Ambassador greeting the Princess after her transoceanic voyage, to lead her to the press briefing he's set up. He's quite proud to tell that representatives were present from all the press, radio broadcasters, AND TV!! In 1940, what's 'TV'?!",/review/rw7087876/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2021,pgooden,8," Good back story
",I am enjoying this as the back story is interesting. KM portrayal of FDR is ridiculous- FDR comes off as a total buffoon - The cinematography is exceptional and the Crown princess comes off realistically according to historical documents.,/review/rw7087876/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2021,authenticsarah,7," Good to watch, but someone owes Martha an apology
","WARNING - MAJOR SPOILERS ----The story is great, and there is certainly a lot of tension - the Norwegian royal family escapes the Nazis, Martha and the kids bum rush Swedish border control to get out of Norway, the King of Sweden (her uncle) has to disinvite her to protect his country from the Nazis, meanwhile King Haakon and Olav make it to London while Martha and the kids manage to get on a US transport ship to America where they live under the protection of FDR for the duration of the war. There are 2 foiled kidnapping attempts. Martha comes into her own, learning diplomacy and how to lobby on behalf of her country, developing a presence and public speaking skills with the help of Eleanor Roosevelt, taking Norwegian veterans into her own home, rebuffing the advances of FDR, and all while raising 3 children and trying to maintain their family's culture and traditions in a far away land without the support of her husband who she repeatedly begs to join them. It was riveting. But what do the filmmakers give her for all of this? A petty, self centered Olav who is jealous and suspicious of her relationship with FDR (at one point punishing her for breaking off contact when he specifically asked her to do so), allows himself to take the credit for her work in bringing about the Lend Lease Act, and ultimately threatens to take the children away from her. Tobias Santelmann does a fantastic job, I wanted to slap him in the face myself, which thank goodness Nikolai took care for me. I know some of this is done for dramatic effect, but it was unkind to Olav, and extraordinarily unkind to Martha. And after all that, the filmmakers couldn't even bother with an apology from Olav - just joining her early on the boat ride in, and creating an office for her in their home. It left me feeling flat, like the story wasn't entirely resolved. Yay, they're together again, but why should Martha trust Olav? If the filmmakers could put Martha and Olav through some invented marital strife, then surely they could invent the words to atone for the pain they went through.",/review/rw7087876/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2021,theshinybeetle,5," Great Acting; Script Needs Work
","So much of this story is genuinely interesting, especially to an American audience that most likely is not aware of Norway's history during WW II. Or knowledgeable about the friendship that developed between the Crown Princess and FDR. The sets and locations are great (except the production team seems to think it snows a lot in WDC, which it doesn't), the costumes have been done well and, as I mentioned in the title, the acting is superb. However, if someone were to watch this and not know much US history they would think all FDR needed to run the country was one advisor, one girlfriend, his wife and the Princess who got together at cocktail hour for a laugh. The way he is depicted borders on the ridiculous (and I'm not referring to his roving eye). Our country was in the middle of a depression and, eventually, at war and all we see FDR do is eat, drink and be merry as if he had no responsibilities or a care in the world. I've just finished E.6 and we've seen FDR in exactly one Cabinet meeting (that lasted a nano-second). I think the moment that really strained credulity was FDR being driven 30 minutes out of WDC to see the Princess on the evening of Dec. 7, 1941. Really?! The US is attacked by the Japanese that day and FDR is having drinks with his lady friend instead of being in a cabinet meeting?! I realize the focus of this limited series is more human than political (although we're seeing an awful lot of political meetings in Norway and London) but the 'lighter' side of FDR should have been balanced with at least some gravitas. He didn't win four elections because he knew how to flirt and drink Scotch. Where are the producers at Masterpiece?! Am I the only one seeing how this one-dimensional depiction of our wartime President diminishes the whole series.",/review/rw7087876/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2020,esakolsok,9," An unknown story for most viewers?
","There has been a lot of controversy with this series about whether the events are historically correct. What was said between the princess and Roosevelt is not known. Most of the series is based on rumors and speculation.
The Norwegian royal family was related to the English royal family when Haakon's wife was an English royal.
It was therefore natural that they would support England, but the Norwegian people were more divided on whether they should support Germany or England. Most chose to be indifferent. As a historical series, I think it is exciting and emotionally engaging. Much better than others Norwegian series that have described the war, which are mostly heroic epics.
We could need more World War II series about those who sided wrong, and why they acted as they did?",/review/rw7087876/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2020,aandfo-55628,9," Thorougly enjoyable
","Atlantic Crossing is not a documentary and should not be viewed as such. Nevertheless I was drawn into the drama of the exiled Norwegian Crown Prince and Princess, a family that were separated during the Second World War, due to duty and circumstances.
Whilst living in seperate host countries and having absolutely no political influence and power, the drama portrays how the prince and princess, in very different ways, did everything they could to contribute to the war effort. The ultimate cost of their efforts placing an enormous strain on the royal marriage. Atlantic Crossing is well worth watching, but perhaps for a more mature audience.",/review/rw7087876/?ref_=tt_urv

28 April 2021,kmhowie,6," So much research, so much wrong
","Much has been made of how much research the producers conducted in making this series. Yet they also go out of their way to point out that it is not a documentary and that it is only ""inspired by actual events"". Why, then, do they get so many simple details wrong. During the speech announcing the Lend Lease program we see the president's advisers listening on a large vacuum tube radio. So far, so good. But we then see a crowd of people watching the speech live through the windows of a store well stocked with what appear to be high quality television sets. This was 1940 and TV sets were nowhere near the mass produced product this scene depicts.",/review/rw7087876/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2021,Portobella,3," Stilted acting & poor script
","Arggh, disappointed about this one, since I usually enjoy watching Sofia Helin and Tobias Santelmann. But there is too much stilted acting (mostly from minor characters) and 'theatre acting' that should have been amended by the director. That and the questionable historical 'facts' make you wonder WHY this film project? If you want to know about this particular period in Norways history go watch The King's Choice instead with wonderful Danish actor Jesper Christensen as the aging King.",/review/rw7087876/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2021,conway3000,10," Good Interesting Series
","I thoroughly enjoyed Atlantic Crossing! I know it was not historically accurate. It was well acted and entertaining! The story of the Norwegian Crown Princess and FDR is not a well known story. Even though it was a slow burn at the beginning, the story was well worth my time.",/review/rw7087876/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2021,david-be-good,10," Don't listen to the history-nerds
","Yes, the series might have some incorrect historical events or incidents. But if you love great adventure-drama, this is a good production. And TV-series dosent have to be perfectly accurate according to history anyways. It's set during the second war in Norway, following the royal family. Acting and writing is in good quality.
I would rate it 8/10, but give it a 10 - because of the unfair rating people give only based on some fake events.",/review/rw7087876/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2021,viewer13,2," boring AND ahistorical
","The basic premise of this series could have been truly interesting. If the writers hadn't drifted into third-rate soap opera, forgotten every rule of editing and narrative structure, and decided to make up their own damn ""facts."" It's hard to evaluate the quality of the performances considering how ridiculous the script is, but Kyle MacLachlan's FDR comes across as a simpering horndog with an astounding amount of spare time on his hands for someone supposedly busy rescuing America from the Depression and masterminding one of the largest and most complex military efforts the planet has ever seen. Eleanor Roosevelt is played as a Bizarro Opposite World version of her real-life self, and Harry Hopkins is a bland drip, utterly wasted here. Anything potentially worth knowing about Scandinavia's role in WWII is glossed over or grossly simplified. And the injury to actual historical truth goes WAY beyond the bounds of what's reasonably permitted by the ""inspired by real events"" sort of artistic license. I'm stunned that PBS wasted time and money acquiring and airing this utter piece of garbage.",/review/rw7087876/?ref_=tt_urv

17 May 2021,jimbenben,4," Masterpiece parody?
","Well, I've watched all eight episodes. I'm not concerned about possible historical inaccuracies. It's a docudrama after all, and it's refreshing to have a ""Masterpiece"" from somewhere besides Britain. But the series is really quite terrible. The script often comes across as a grade school historical pageant, with actors orating bombastic lines. There is rarely any sense of real people with real emotions having actual conversations. It's as if the Norwegians decided to outdo Masterpiece Theatre by throwing in every cliche of the genre. The result is a parody that had me rolling my eyes and laughing out loud.",/review/rw7087876/?ref_=tt_urv

7 December 2020,sirtorch,2," Fake history
","Fake history and the reluctance of the director and writers to take responsibility is deeply unsettling. This cloud have been an interesting story, however, as the major historical events are fake, it strands completely. I assume it is to once again write in women as more prominent in history, but as this ""fake history"" controversy is unfolding in the media in Norway, it not only fails but will question marks with all so-called historical series in the future.",/review/rw7087876/?ref_=tt_urv

","You can't save bad script with good actors. And these series have good/ok actors, but not great.
After 5 episodes I was just thinking that this stupid, ridiculous series. Only good thing was that Swedish king was seen as an nazi. Because he was a nazi.
NRK just can't make good big money series. They try to be so Hollywood, but it always ends up to be weird disaster. I give 4 stars because I see that they're trying.",/review/rw7087876/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2021,bthwaithe,5," Half the Story is Missing
","Ok, so we see how the war affected Norwegian & Swedish royalty. They hung around in palaces and escaped on ships. But what was it like for an average Norwegian family? This is how I'm used to watching these kinds of shows - show how the toffs make out while showing an ordinary family getting through the occupation. I guess the original Upstairs Downstairs series spoiled me, showing how the posh Bellamys lived through the aftermath of the Boer War, women's suffrage, the Bloomsbury group, the sinking of the Titanic, WW1, the general strike & the crash of the stock market. But it also showed how the lower classes experienced the same events. I'd like to have seen more experiences of a typical Norwegian family under Nazi occupation. Only showing the poshes is leaving out half the story.",/review/rw7087876/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2021,nancyldraper,7," Interesting story from WW II
","This is a series created for Norwegian Television but adopted by Masterpiece Theatre to be brought to America. It tells an interesting piece of history and it is worth the watch just for that. I am not a fan of Kyle MacLachlan so that may have flavoured how I was off put by the relationship between FDR and the Crown Princess. What really spoke to me was the journey from helplessness to heroine of the protagonist and I think it will resonate especially with women who will understand her struggles more personally than men might. It wasn't a binge watch for me, it was a little too slow and heavy but I do recommend it to anyone who loves historical retelling of WW Ii stories. I give this series a 7 (good) out of 10 {Historical Drama}",/review/rw7087876/?ref_=tt_urv
