11 May 2022,gsygsy,8," Stay with it
","Well written, beautifully directed and sensitively performed, this ends up being a deeply moving film. Director Colm Bairéad keeps his nerve as far as pacing is concerned, and as a result I expect there'll be some who find this too slow-moving for their taste. But stay with it. It's worth it.",/review/rw8684642/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2022,nickphelan-25748,10," A masterpiece
","Quite simply, the best Irish movie, I've ever seen. Not just Irish language but Irish! Sublime cinematography, direction and acting. Based on Claire Keegan's book Foster, this tells the story of Cait a withdrawn little girl from a poor big rural family who during her mother's latest pregnancy is packed off to live with a older rural couple who are relatives. Catherine Clinch is a revelation as the title character and Carrie Crowleyis her usual reliable self and Andrew Bennett in his role as the taciturn substitute father developing a relationship with Cait who delivers a powerful
emotional punch. This movie had me welling up unexpectedly a number of times and there are so many nostalgic moments in relation to late 70s early 80s Ireland in relation to tv, sport and clothes. It is a joyous film that I cannot recommend highly enough it hypnotised me . I'm not staying quiet about this!",/review/rw8684642/?ref_=tt_urv

","A quiet voice often speaks louder than those trying to drown it out. I will go to the cinema to sit back and be entertained, but I often go to experience lives lived in other circumstances. Roger Ebert referred to cinema as a machine for generating empathy, and this film is a wonderful example.",/review/rw8684642/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wonderfully understated and yet filled with a million moments that will resonate - the difficulties of saying what you feel, of leaving the past behind, of understanding and being understood. It brought to my mind thoughts of the many kindnesses I have been shown in my life and I found it very moving.",/review/rw8684642/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,somembom,9," It builds
","It's a low paced movie where what hooks you up are the expressions, the gestures, the camera focusing on somewhere out of the scene. It's driving us to that young girl's mind. The cast is perfect and the plot, not being something new, gives us a fresh build up in tension, a low paced tension that arrives nowhere and everywhere at the very end. Even if for a tiny bit here or there, I believe each of us will find something to relate to when we were young.",/review/rw8684642/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2022,Jaffaroll,9," Sensitive Irish film.
",If you were looking for negatives you could say this is a tad manipulative and slow. But most fiction is manipulative to a degree and the unhurried pace is appropriate to the film. It is an excellent Irish production.,/review/rw8684642/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2022,michelledennehy,10," Stunning
","Beautiful film that has a quiet gentleness about it. It allows the viewer time to absorb all the little nostalgic details. There are sequences when nothing much happening like the girl is sitting in the back seat of her dad's car looking at the sky & it took my right back to what that feels like- to be a child and to just stare at the clouds & daydream. Such wonderful performances by all especially the young lead actress. Excellent cinematography, direction & set design. Bravo to all concerned. Maith sibh! Go see it on the big screen - it is good for the soul!",/review/rw8684642/?ref_=tt_urv

","As an Irishman, I went into this movie, with an open mind, open eyes, and open ears. All three senses were taken aback, with the storyline, and how it was presented. The plaudits being espoused don't nearly say enough, how wonderful this gem is.",/review/rw8684642/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,Behnam-A,9," Such an exceptional piece of filmmaking
","I start with the story. This movie is an eye-opening wonderfully made piece of art about the most precious things in life. The movie demonstrates the importance of kindness, love, and care which you may not be aware of unless you lose them. That is one aspect of the story. Another important aspect of the story is children's problems in integrating with the environment, even with their own family, based on their personality. To have a different personality could be hard and gets amplified in a toxic family. The aspect of a toxic family, especially toxic parents has been presented as masterfully as possible. I won't explain the details to avoid spoiling the movie.",/review/rw8684642/?ref_=tt_urv

","Based on the renowned story, Foster, by Claire Keegan, THE QUIET GIRL is an exquisite and heart-wrenching Irish drama set in 1981. The film follows 11-year-old girl, Cáit (Catherine Clinch) who is sent to live with foster parents for the summer after her dysfunctional family life becomes too much to handle. Maeve quickly falls in love with the bucolic setting and her foster parents but discovers a troubling secret that threatens to destroy the idyllic world she has found herself in.",/review/rw8684642/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is one for a quiet evening. It begins very slow but it is the slowness that captures the beauty of the story.

","The Quiet Girl (An Cailín Ciúin) is a truly interesting piece of film. Its squared aspect ratio (13:7) and often rather shallow depth of field contribute to a sense of deep focus on the subject at hand and an often child like point of view. The film is also highly detail oriented , there's not much big or dramatic that happens, but small hints of something here or there, a hint of a smile, a cookie left on a table, convey most of the film's action. And as any film so reliant on subtle detail must be, the acting is superb. Catherine Clinch (Cáit) who won the IFTA award for Best Actress for her role in The Quiet Girl was particularly good. Cáit's relationship with Seán (Andrew Bennett) and their mutual quietness was probably the film's highlight for me. It was also really cool to see a film almost exclusively in the Irish language. The Quiet Girl is ultimately a heartwarming and breaking meditation on love and grief, and a slow film that lives up to its name, look away and you may miss a key subtlety, but its all the better for it.",/review/rw8684642/?ref_=tt_urv
