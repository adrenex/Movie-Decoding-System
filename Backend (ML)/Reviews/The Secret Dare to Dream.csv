6 January 2023,rachelereyna,7," I don't understand the hate!
","I don't know if people were expecting a masterpiece or something but I found the series enjoyable. Is it cheesey? Yes, but so was the movie. Many of us Willow fans were kids when it came out. You have to watch the series with the eyes of the kid you were and think of this as a fun, family, fantasy series. The special effects aren't bad, better then the 80's for sure. Yes it's a little YA, but that's because they are trying to reach a new audience, a younger one, and I don't think there is anything wrong with that. Stop trying to take everything so seriously and just enjoy it for what it is. It's not supposed to be another Game of Thrones, which could work in it's favor considering the ending of that show.",/review/rw8723065/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2022,gepetto33,," Sadmartigan :(
","It's become apparent that Disney feels some grotesque need to release content on their platform without any deeper thought about what & where to go with it. This is the feeling you get with Willow, and the writing that doesn't even feel amatuer-ish - it feels embarrassing. For everybody on that show, Warwick especially. It's apparent that the writer has no connection with what the character/actor would comfortably say at any given time, prompting him to spew out wordy, awkward lines, that he has to somehow form together into ""acting"". The dialogue comes across so unnaturally it's embarrassing. Somebody should feel ashamed for this, really.",/review/rw8723065/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2022,briandernsferd,6," Disney really sucks at making anything better than basic
","Why do you have to do this? Why do you take stories like this and write the most useless and annoying script and story. This was made for 10 year olds who don't know any better. The Harry Styles wardrobe of the prince, the angsty teenagers, the weird modern vocabulary and style, the out of place mix of American and British accents, (the horses jumping off an 80 foot cliff into water only to show that the water is only 2 feet deep and they're now walking across it (Yeah that really happened...)). Disney continues to make such uninspired, thoughtless content that is so surface level and frustrating.",/review/rw8723065/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2022,jamesvass-62316,3," Struggling with the cast, and struggling with the acting.
","""Like totally bad ass princes..."" And with that piece of dialogue from the main culprit of this farce, my hopes for a well written or perhaps performed story were dashed. The series picks up '200 moons' after the events of the first. The queen has had two children with Mad Mardigan, and Elora Dannen has been placed in witness protection again. After the typical arranged marriage and reluctant princes scenario unfolds in the first act, the palace is attacked by mysterious, but well thought out enemies, and the prince gets himself handsomely kidnapped... Enter quest to rescue... The, by now highly unlikable and clearly gay princes, heads out to save her helpless but handsome brother from the forces of evil. The prince's life long guardian and protector who is part of their group gets killed in an attack and she doesn't even acknowledge his death! Instead opting to run away and later snuggle with her female companion by the campfire. The spirit of family and friendship which helped develop the characters in the original movie have been set aside to tick boxes and ensure that the cold, selfish, narcissistic nature of the new contemporary characters blaze trails... I gave it a 3 for Warwick...",/review/rw8723065/?ref_=tt_urv

30 November 2022,pyrothing,6," Willow returns as a pile of dung...
","Warwick is ok, the rest of the actors, accents and all the rest is so far terrible. Willow was a childhood favorite including the books but this does not come remotely close to capturing the magic that was the original Willow.",/review/rw8723065/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2022,JayDano,2," What a disappointment...
","I so wanted this to be great... But it really feels like a group of highschoolers cosplaying and joking around, bringing out of retirement their parents' teenage movie heroes. I know it's fiction, in an imagined world, chocked full of magic and so on. But it would give it a more realistic tone if the language used was more sophisticated; if the character's behavior, attitude, manners... had been worked on more, instead of sounding and feeling like an angstsy teenager reading the script; if the wardrobe didn't include a couple of woodswomen wearing jeans and flannel; basically, if the original story had been treated with respect by Disney+ and they had spent more resources in making it better. I really don't want to blast any of the actors (well, one of them is terrible, but I'll let her be, she's young and has time to refine her skills), but Lucasfilm should have been more careful with how they handled their treasured Willow.",/review/rw8723065/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,nipple_blaster,8," Show is made to be lightweight and fun, not LoTR serious
","If you disliked the acting and dialogue, you clearly misunderstood what was going on in the show. It's not meant to be a serious and heavyweight fantasy like LoTR for example, but a fun ride that you can sit, relax, and enjoy for 40 mins. For me it even felt a little bit like fantasy satire. At some points it was almost breaking the fourth wall even, like when they were talking about ""the quest"" they were on (as if it's a video game) and mocking the tropers they were getting themselves into.",/review/rw8723065/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,coles_notes,7," Good
","Created by Jonathan Kasdan as a follow up to the original film in 1988, this Willow follows the same world many years later as Elora Danan has been hidden away and the daughter of the great Madmartigan has been tasked on an adventure alongside some new and old friends to trek to the other side of the world to defeat the evil Crone, a dark spirit trying to take over the world by any means necessary. Using the film as a jumping off point, this new Willow doesn't strive for seriousness much like the original and only works the better for it. Often with multiple gut laughs per episode, most of this series is a lighthearted joke, more of a satire of adventure dramas than it is something wholly standing on its own. I thought the writing was exceptional, and the CGI, sets, and wardrobe were done quite well. The acting was hit and miss but mostly good, although I have the strong sense that some of the bad acting that is there was slightly on purpose, perhaps part of the joke, though there was definitely some line delivery that could have used a few more takes. Warwick Davis doesn't bring much range beyond his usual semi-serious tone, but on the other hand I would have rioted if they cast anyone else to play his character, so it works. I thought it was really funny, but I could see how some would be disappointed if they wanted a serious adventure. If you go in for a laugh with some love of the original you're going to have a very good time. Would recommend and I hope we see season 2.",/review/rw8723065/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2022,herrbrett,2," Fans Are Not Target Audience
","Look, 40 something fans who loved the movie are not the target audience. It's not bad for a teen drama with magic. I have daughters, I get it. This show is closer to Monster High than it is to Willow. Disappointing, but not surprised.",/review/rw8723065/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,arminio-70098,," A fun fantasy romp
","I really loved watching this series. In an era of more serious dramatic fantasy series (which I still love) like Game of Thrones, This reminded me of genre shows of the late 1990s, like Xena, Stargate, and Farscape. And like those shows while it has a bunch of fun light moments, it is capable of pausing and allowing more dramatic serious ones. It has a tone and style that's not for everyone but it's constant with it. If you like D&D shows like Critical Role or Dimension 20, or loved the movie a Knight's Tale, you will probably like this show. Loved all the characters, both new and returning and really hoping for more seasons.",/review/rw8723065/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2022,Matt-Canalcon,7," Warwick Davis is back!
","I was able to see the first 4 episodes. The series will likely please die-hard fans of the original film because I mostly enjoyed what I was able to see, it takes some time to get used to the new characters & the modern look of the series but they don't waste too long getting the adventure started with some fun action, comedy & heart. I love Warwick Davis and it's great that they bring him back in this role, he hasn't lost his touch. If you fell in love with Willow during your childhood, you are going to be more than happy to see that he's just as inspiring and courageous as he was back then. I think the pacing is on-point so far, the world was fresh in my head after watching Willow the night before but they use the mythology very well to build the foundation for this season.",/review/rw8723065/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2022,RussHog,1," The Bones Tell Me Nothing...except this show sucks.
","Huge disappointment in the premiere episode. It feels as if the people who made this just did not care. The mythos is textbook but soulless and it feels more like they are making fun of the genre than trying to do anything serious with it. There are no good establishing shots the action is bad, the acting is cringe, the dialogue is terrible, and even when poor Willow himself shows up the show makes him just silly and ridiculous. Truly one of the worst things I've ever sat through. This is not as bad as The Rings of Power, but it's right up there with The Wheel of Time or some of the other awful shows that get thrown around. Sadly, it's a no from me, dawg.",/review/rw8723065/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2023,sarahelizsnell,7," The story of Willow continues in new entertaining, modern fantasy, adolescent-geared, Disney show!
","I must preface this review by saying that the original film is an absolute classic and my favorite movie of all time. It is difficult to compare the new show to the original film; however, being a huge fan of the original story and characters has made this show exciting and even a blast to watch. While the script and characters are definitely more geared for a modern, 'teeny bopper', Disney-oriented audience, it still did not disappoint in the realm of fantasy, magic, love, friendship, human experience, and humor. Overall, I found that it is fun, entertaining, dramatic, and has tons of connections to the original film, which really keeps me most interested in watching it. I also thought that while the story and plot were pretty simple, they were also clever, especially in regards to Elora not knowing who she was and what she was capable of - and watching that discovery and growth unfold throughout the series. The new, distinct characters that go together on the quest, despite acting like awkward and maybe even annoying modern teenagers, are actually pretty fun/ny as well as those they meet along the way. I enjoyed seeing all of their interactions and growth throughout Season 1. Warwick Davis, as Willow, remains true to his original character. And I love how ""what happened to Mad Mardigan"" remains a mystery so that he is actually honored as a vital part of the new series without necessarily starring in it. While the series does not have the same vibe as the original film it is based on (especially with its more modernized, adolescent take), it is still a fun, creative, and entertaining way to keep the story going - and I am really hoping for and cannot wait for Season 2! Thank you, Disney and Lucasfilm for bringing the fantasy and magic of the story of Willow back into our lives!",/review/rw8723065/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2022,debracurle,3," If you're a fan of the movie steer clear
","Another excellent 80's movie dumbed down for current American teenagers. Absolutely brutal. I wanted to love it. Heck I would have settled for liking it. Nope. Got 15 minutes in to Ep 1 and had to quit before I puked. Didn't even get far enough to actually see Willow himself. If you have zero expectations and no appreciation for good acting you might be ok. For me this is on par with Big Brother and other shallow, vapid American tv shows aimed at the 13-21 crowd. Ug even The Chronicles of Shannara was better and that's saying something. Gag me with a spoon. I'm out. Sorry Willow.",/review/rw8723065/?ref_=tt_urv

","After 3 episodes, this show resembles the Willow movie in name only. The tone, atmosphere and characters are completely different in style. It's silly and irreverent. The Willow movie had humor but it fit naturally into the plot, it knew how to balance dark and light moments. This show seems completely tone deaf.",/review/rw8723065/?ref_=tt_urv
