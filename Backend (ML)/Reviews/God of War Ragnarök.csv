14 November 2022,bvtxmvn,10," I'm left speechless
","Never has a game left me with such awe. Left in goosebumps I sit here thinking about the last hours I poured into this beautiful game. With the same set of goosebumps that help tight to my skin the entire playthrough. The character development had my face stained with a permanent smile. The story had me engrossed and excited. The gameplay was far more snappy and quick, heavy hitting and impactful. The world is so immersive and real. The lessons learned and the story presented is one that will forever stick. I know as a certainty that this game won't leave my mind for quite some time.",/review/rw8721503/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2022,hfreinoso,10," it was perfect. Perfect. Everything, down to the last minute details
","What Homelander has said? ""It was perfect... Perfect. Everything. Down to the bone."" I love this video game. I am a huge God of War fan and I love PlayStation video games. Uncharted, Jak and Dexter, Ratchet and Clank, Twisted Metal, Ghost of Tsushima, The Last of Us, Horizon Zero Dawn, Stray, Little Big Planet, Spider-Man, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, etc. I can keep going. I love everything about this game, the story, acting, characters, cinematography, controls, and music. My god, this video game is perfect. God of War deserves the Game of the Year. I love both T. C Carson and Christopher Judge as Kratos, they are the best, at what they do. I love this game and this game really does deserve to be Game of the Year. 10/10. God of War never lets me down. PlayStation/Sony, you done it again folks. That's why you guys are the best. More games like these Playstation. More like these. 10/10.",/review/rw8721503/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2022,mertafor,10," A masterful craftsmanship exceeds any expectations
","Now I understand how Sony was convinced to release first GOW (2018) on PC. Honestly if I wouldn't have a Playstation, I could be looking to get a PS4 or PS5 asap. Because this is not only one of the greatest title of Sony, but also it's probably the best blockbuster in recent memory. Even first Avengers or Endgame didn't give me this sort of satisfaction to be honest, nowhere close. Such a complete and epic storytelling, vastly increased depth in character development, dialogues and actions make sense, unforgettable moments, perfected an already great gameplay with highly improved graphics. And most of all, face animations are probably the most realistic ones. Especially Freya and Kratos seemed like almost real people.",/review/rw8721503/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2022,shahrukhanjum-72996,10," Peak of Story Telling Achieved
","This game is nothing less than an emotional roller coaster ride, I won't spoil the story but very few Hollywood movies can match the story telling. Story, Gameplay, Graphics all were perfect, the same perfect formula of 2018 game God of War was used and you don't need to change what you have already perfected, Don't watch any YouTube reviews go in the game blind and experience every new character for the first time, its a must buy for first day and playstation have told us that they are still the king of making single player story games and no studio can come even close to playstation when it comes to making a great story.",/review/rw8721503/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2022,brianbuettler,10," I feel complete
","This is one for the books. I've been playing god of war since its inception and this is the most satisfying installment in the series by far and that's saying a lot. The journey Kratos has took over 8 games defies description but I will do my best to give it justice. This man has became a God by slaughtering the Pantheon. You sympathesize with Kratos, knowing he's justified in all his actions. Sure, they're out of anger and malice but that ill-will is well deserved. Then we have the Norse version of the games and I'm taken aback by this much more reserved and wise protagonist. His redemption arch sets a bar I don't think another game will top for a long time. To watch him become a father and a fully-realized God is a sight to see. Anyone who has a Playstation I urge you this is a series that cannot be missed.",/review/rw8721503/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2022,graystripe38898,10," God of War Ragnarök
","A fantastic and strong continuation of its predecessor, God of War Ragnarök is not afraid to take unexpected turns, or slow its pace for you to fully explore an environment. It has the same upgrading system as before, but with better armor, in my opinion. Atreus is a little bit older now and it's so great to see everybody reprise their magnificent roles.",/review/rw8721503/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2022,runrunrun-47755,10," MASTERPIECE (Read my whole review to understand why some people are rating it 0 or 1)
","God of War Ragnarok is a MASTERPIECE. It has met every fans expectation and by far surpassed it. It improves everything on what made God of War 2018 so great. I am having a time of my life playing this game. Graphics are out of this world. The best graphics I have seen in any game to this date. The Gameplay remains unbeatable. So satisfying with every click of a button and you can feel all those attacks with haptic feedback on the ps5 controller. The pure bliss of all the variety of attacks, combos and moves. Different ways to slaughter your enemies. Oh boy If I sit and state every great thing this game offers it will take me an eternity. This game is the sole worthy of the title ""Masterpiece"" and ""Game of the Year 2022"" atleast in my and many MANY others opinions.",/review/rw8721503/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2022,bensam-73923,10," Best game ever ?!?!
","There's too many good things to say about this game. For me this definitively wins game of the year over the great Elden Ring. Although gameplay is just built upon 2018 is still feels fresh and has the players always on his toes. Opposed to the 2018 game, this one has plenty of enemy variety. Where this game really sets itself apart is story and characters. I now think of kratos at a top 10 character in fiction. The story is great and connects everything in a way for the most impactful ending for kratos. He finally becomes a loved god and has healthy relationships around him. Even though I wanted to absolutely tear apart Odin and Thor, the way the game went made the story much better. And I still got to choke Heimdall to death. My one complaint would be that ragnarok should've contained multiple levels and Thor's final fights should've been bigger in scale, maybe even having them fight on Jormandgandrs back. The soundtrack ramps up the epicness of Ragnarok though and even Hozier makes a song for this soundtrack. Bear did an amazing job with it. Cory and Eric did an amazing job with this game and deserves a lot more recognition than it will ever get due to it being a PlayStation exclusive and people being addicted to cod and nothing else. I live the twist in this game although I saw it coming and had since watching a YouTube theory on it back in 2018. Can't believe it guessed it. Hurst is amazing as Thor and I prefer this to mcu even. I enjoyed that they went all out with the 2 realms we hadn't visited yet. The Thor revive screen was fun and creative. The spear was a great weapon and added new thoughts to a players combat. So many touching scenes, fun fights, lores, discoverable areas, great visuals, and great dialogue make this game. Kratos and Atreus connection is amazing, mimir is a great brother, freya compliments Kratos, Odin is a business dictator and Thor his hammer. I'm going to have to think whether this is the best game ever made, but it is definitely worthy of being in the conversation.",/review/rw8721503/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2022,carobertson95,10," Unmatched
","This has to be the best game I've ever played. From the story and dialogue to the combat. Seamlessly switching between the two. I have never played a game this polished and emotionally moving. Life can get hard and rough sometimes and the fact that I can sit down and become completely immersed in a world with lore and family compassion and badass destruction, It truly is unmatched to any game I've played. This is an incredible feat accomplished in the gaming world. To all the Devs, Studio and Actors on this team we salute you. 10/10, congrats to the team on this masterpiece. Thank you, thank you.",/review/rw8721503/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2022,eliasbergrikstad,10," What an incredible sequel!
",This is god of war's (2018) doom eternal situation. A really good game reboots a beloved franchise and gets a sequel after four years that takes the original and improves on everything. Still this game is unique enough from the original to feel completely new.,/review/rw8721503/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2022,QuantumVoxel,10," Quite possibly the best game that has ever existed.
","After the success of the 2018 reboot of God Of War, I found it very hard to even fathom what could possibly be improved and was concurrently worried that a sequel would water down the brilliance and poignance of the first.",/review/rw8721503/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2022,Rayofsun71,10," A really good game but just as one miniscule problem
","All right yes there is no doubting that this game is absolutely amazing, love the graphics, love the storytelling and most of all how smoothly it runs on PS5, the only miniscule problem that I have with the game is that on my first hour of the game the length of the cutscenes took up a good chunk of that time, I fully understand that it is part of the story and a very good one at that so I can definitely deal with it, again this is a very miniscule problem but that is quickly solved with the amazing gameplay and scenery I know it isn't open world, would've been cool if it was and keep in mind this game is not for everyone but to those who decide to play it, you're in for something special.",/review/rw8721503/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2022,nelsonkc,10," Groundbreaking game
",This video game is revolutionary and has mastered combat in gaming maybe in history and the story is tipped over the top with action and emotion this has a almost positive chance to win goty. This game will live in gaming history forever. I highly recommend to get it and give it a try for this is the pinicle of gaming for possibly years to come and has many hours this game does not cut corners and has plenty of time for the story to play out and doesn't cut short and the one thing wrong with god of war 2018 was there were not enough gods but this game exceeds in this there are gods left and right friendly and not. Highly recommend.,/review/rw8721503/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2022,Nob0dy,4," Overhyped,monotonous, rushed ending
","First things first, feel free to down vote this to oblivion and back. I am aware this game is blindly worshiped partly because kratos is in it and partly because some big youtubers have played it, which means reviews on sites like this are inflated heavily by children blindly worshiping something just because a millionaire youtuber said they enjoyed it.",/review/rw8721503/?ref_=tt_urv

19 November 2022,razvanpometcu,10," Definition of GotY
","This game is brilliant. It changed a lot the way to play and its difficulty, the puzzles were much more complicated, and although the game from 2018 seemed to have everything and if it had appeared it would have had nothing to add, I was wrong,however, I have nothing more to say about the characters who were perfect, the voice acting was also perfect, the game's graphics, structure and the story was brilliant. In addition to this, in the previous game I really liked that father-son relationship and how it works from the beginning, and in the new game we see the same thing where Atreus is in his teenage years and these problems of finding out who he is confuses Kratos it was the perfect game to end a franchise and I hope to see how the next projects will look like.",/review/rw8721503/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2022,missraziel,5," GoW goes americanised
","Not sure how to express this one. I loved God Of War 2018, it felt gritty, focused and Kratos was hurting but strong through the whole story. Atreus was the usual kind of curious and rebellious kid as expected from one of a young age who is learning the world around them from a dangerous situation, the behaviour was acceptable.",/review/rw8721503/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2022,jebyvyson,8," Incredible story and gameplay with minor issues.
","God of War (2018) left a huge impact not only the game series, but the video games as a whole. The shift direction of bringing something new to God of War was a risk to take, and successful one at that. Now, we come to the next sequel of the Norse era getting the taste of Ragnarok and how our lovable characters handle their next adventure.",/review/rw8721503/?ref_=tt_urv
