18 January 2019,bob-the-movie-man,7," Not the 10* French classic, but a fun and moving movie nonetheless.
","So, the movie-going audience for this film will divide into two categories: those that have seen the original 2011 French classic ""The Intouchables"" that this is based on, and those that haven't. ""The Intouchables"" would have got 10* from me, no problem.",/review/rw6931530/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2019,nowego,9," Stands on its Own
","Having seen the original more than five times I can say this easily compares in quality. The original Intouchables from 2011, is in French so you need to read subtitles which never worried me. It is brilliant so if you like this and don't mind subtitles find it and watch it.",/review/rw6931530/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2019,ejp9718,10," This quadriplegic was in tears
","I'm so thankful to Kevin Hart, Bryan Cranston, Nicole Kidman, Neil Burger and the rest of those involved in this remake! Movies entertain us but they are even better when they can educate, entertain, and make us laugh at the same time. There have been no movies with big celebrity actors showing that a quadriplegic can actually live a regular life and have happiness. There were 2 big movies that came out and the quadriplegic chose suicide at the end. Instead of being looked at like a regular person, we are looked at with pity. Yes our life is hard! It's not easy being completely dependent on others for everything! It's been 22 years and I don't have millions of dollars or a fully accessible house or a nice ""patty wagon"" like Bryan's character had in the movie but I have God and family and friends and I live a good life! I still got a bachelors degree and I still found love and I was able to be a mother! We have fun and choose to laugh ALOT despite our circumstances. I hope everybody learns something from this movie!

22 May 2019,Piixie88,7," There will always be remakes
","This is a remake of the 2011 French film, ""The Intouchables"". Being a remake it is bound to not be exactly the same as the original and there will be changes, add ons or takeaways but the story remains almost the same.",/review/rw6931530/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2019,UniqueParticle,8," Genuine nurturing film about a quadraplegic
","Bryan Cranston is easily one of the most badass actors ever because of Breaking Bad, and this is a complete opposite character where he can't walk or do most things. Kevin Hart is great in drama roles, he should do them more. I barely found this funny at all, except a few chuckle worthy moments. Also I really enjoy one of the director's other films Limitless, Neil Burger is very good at his craft! I remember reading this getting hate, I don't get it with this movie, it has a moment of racism in the beginning otherwise this is a heartwarming cozy movie and I am glad I waited to see by renting it at my nearest library!",/review/rw6931530/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2019,sigmund_igthorn,5," An unnecessary movie.
","Remakes happen, as well as re-imaginings. However they make sense when a director/writer have something more to add to the story, especially as beautiful as this one in a French original. Here we got a back to back copy of a quite recent movie. A movie, that was a huge international hit, and is well known outside of the USA, so a so recent remakwe, ekhm, copy, is the more baffling. This is not the case of The Lion King, which was inspired by an obscure Japanese cartoon, and a wider audience got a chance to known the story. THe original made over 400 millions of dollars worldwide...
Are Americans so afraid of subtitles, that they have to make their own versions of movies?",/review/rw6931530/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2017,sunchick116-872-583383,8," What a fun film!
","In a weekend where I had to watch two depressing films about disability this film was a welcome surprise. It was funny, it was charming. It was almost like watching 'me before you' without the depressing ending. Heard this is a remake of the French film so I intend to seek that out and watch it now. Was really great to see a film about disability where it wasn't all doom and gloom.",/review/rw6931530/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2019,anuity,8," IGNORE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!!!!!!!
","I virtually never write a review on IMDb but I have to say something... I'm not sure what's up with negative reviews. Even if you liked the original better, don't be stupid and use that as an excuse to pan this movie. I've never seen the original so I'm not biased. This was a good movie!!",/review/rw6931530/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2018,yogagalCO,8," I enjoyed this film!
",Just saw this at the DENVER Film Festival. Ignore the critics. The leads had excellent chemistry and the film was well paced. Hey folks- this is based on a true story forget the PC police and their BS comments.. I enjoyed the original French film but this one stands on its own. Very enjoyable film.,/review/rw6931530/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2019,don-666,7," Remakes Happen
","Yikes -- people giving this a 1 rating, sight unseen, so they can boast that they saw the French original? Excusez moi, gimme a break. You claim to be a movie buff but sabotage and distort the public ratings system? Did you give The Departed or Insomnia a 1 rating too because they are remakes? Did you skip Sorcerer because The Wages of Fear is on your Criterion shelf? I like the original Intouchables a lot, and this American remake, with much of the same material, has similar impact for a wider audience.",/review/rw6931530/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2019,chris-pulleyn-1,5," Ok as a remake, but still rewatching the original
","I won't nag about this remake. I LOVED ""Intouchables"" gave it a big fat 10. Up there with Shawshank, still gave this a 7 but mainly because of the story, even if Hart doesn't have Omar Sy's blatant, raw, almost offensive humour or persona. I didn't believe Hart was street wise for a moment. They did mix up some of the original plot points which was confusing. Swapping the Love interest for the secretary, making good with the wife instead of the mother and the happily ever after at the end, was a bit too Holiwood Cliche Nice. It hints of formula. Still, it's a decent movie as is, but I'll still choose the original anyday.
By the way people, ""The Untouchables"" as loads of people are calling it, starred Costner & Connery.",/review/rw6931530/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2019,the_remixer08,8," It's a remake, but a good one
","Face it, remakes get done. And if you go into this with an open mind just willing to have fun and enjoy a good story, you'd end up saying the same. So ignore the negative reviews purposely trying to bash this film and go see it for yourself if you want to. It's not the best movie in the world, but it's definitely a movie that will leave you smiling in the end.",/review/rw6931530/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2019,noskins-23349,10," Ignore the negativity
","Literally every negative comment asks you to see the original one. well, we are in the age of remakes and this one is really not a bad one. I enjoyed this film. I knew what i was going for and it came to my expectations. Ofcourse it's not as good as the original ""Masterpiece"" but it is really good. So just ignore the absurdity and enjoy the movie on it's own. Cheers :)",/review/rw6931530/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2019,stretchfoofight,6," Kevin Hart tips the scales
","Not seen the originals, don't know much else. Watched this on a flight. Worth a watch, Kevin Hart actually saves this film a bit, adds a drive and humour and reality to the film. Something most common people could relate to. Perhaps that was just the direction of the character.",/review/rw6931530/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2019,ferguson-6,5," not in line with the original
","Greetings again from the darkness. Frequent movie goers often complain about the lack of originality in American movies. It sometimes seems as if most are sequels, remakes or reboots, or simply pulled from the panels of a comic book. There is another source that is particularly irksome to yours truly, and that's the Americanization of an outstanding film from another country - World Cinema, if you will. Seven plus years ago, while watching the crowd-pleasing (though not so critically acclaimed) and exceptionally performed 2011 French film THE INTOUCHABLES, there was little doubt that it would, at some point, be subjected to an American ""enhancement"". Sure enough, director Neil Burger (THE ILLUSIONIST) perfectly captures why this transition is sometimes so painful to see.",/review/rw6931530/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2019,katiewaugh-35626,10," IGNORE THE NEGATIVITY
","This is a good movie. Simple. It's not the original French one so don't rate it poorly because of that fact.
This is well acted, heart warming, funny and left me feeling good after watching it.
Kevin Heart and Brian Cranston have great chemistry and work well together. Ignore the stuck up Wall Street Journal reviewers and just go enjoy.",/review/rw6931530/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2019,bashfordjames1,9," Feel good factor to a tragic story
","I was taken aback by this film by the story of a paralysed man and what he faced in life but through the help of carers managed to see the 'upside of life..a great cast and especially the chemistry between Brian cranston and Kevin Hart gave the film even more to it.
A mixture of fun and seriousness and thoughtful emotions glide you through the film ending in a positive note..
Definately worth seeing",/review/rw6931530/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2019,rannynm,9," Wonderful Remake of the French Classic with Well-Founded Laughs
","The Upside is a wonderful, but very contrived remake of the French classic: The Intouchables. The superb main duo makes for a variety of heartfelt and well-found laughs. Anyone looking for a packed ""January movie"" will find a perfect outing.",/review/rw6931530/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2019,Hitchcoc,8," At Times a Little Too Easy, but I Enjoyed It
","To start with, I am a huge Brian Cranston fan, and not just for ""Breaking Bad."" He has that interesting demeanor and physicality that I like in actors. Here, he is the quadriplegic mega-rich man who made a foolish decision to para-glide in bad weather. He also lost his wife to cancer. He is angry, continuing to live in the world he created while carrying incredible guilt. Kevin Hart is the man who comes along with every wart you can imaging. An ex convict, a thief, a user, a child support cheat. But he is able to connect with Cranston, much to the chagrin of his financial secretary, Nicole Kidman. Hart's character must learn to do all the dirty jobs required to take care of this guy. They clash, but it's often funny, and he give Cranston a reason to smile again. If there's a criticism, it's that the two get into a routine awfully quickly. There is one bitter disappointment that is really hard to watch, when a woman who has been corresponding with the guy decides to meet him. Very tense. Overall, I really can't understand criticism based on a movie that may have been superior. A true critic wouldn't do that. It would be like judging a new version of Les Miserables based on one done in 1935.",/review/rw6931530/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2019,fubeca_51,10," Deceptive reviews??
","Folks, this film was released in the US Jan 11th, 2019, many of the 1 star reviews were back in October 2018 and appear to have sour grapes that Hollywood seemingly stole the story from the french movie 'The intouchables'...(even though it's marketed as a remake of that film) The mere fact that there are so many of these indignant 1 star ratings suggests that there seems to be a campaign to torpedo the movie's popularity...If all the one star ratings were discounted the movie would likely be somewhere between the 7-8 range",/review/rw6931530/?ref_=tt_urv
