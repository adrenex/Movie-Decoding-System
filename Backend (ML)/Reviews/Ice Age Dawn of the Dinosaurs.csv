3 February 2016,Ed-Shullivan,10," A clear narrative account of Bernie Madoff's 64 billion dollar Ponzi scam
","I was so pleased to hear that the A List actor Richard Dreyfuss (American Graffiti, Jaws, and The Goodbye Girl) signed on to play the U.S.A.'s biggest investment fraudster, the Ponzi scheme master, Bernie Madoff. From the beginning of the biographical film, Richard Dreyfuss narrates the Bernie Madoff biography and he walks us through his ""modus operandi"" how he conned so many smart and wealthy investors starting in 1960 when his accountant father-in-law introduces a young Bernie Madoff to his own circle of clients, as well as many elderly people who entrusted Bernie Madoff with their life savings.

11 February 2016,vchimpanzee,," Fine job, especially by Dreyfuss
","I didn't know that much about Bernie Madoff, except that he had supposedly cheated people out of millions of dollars. Actually, it was billions.",/review/rw3414349/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2016,phd_travel,9," Everything you want to see about Madoff
","For a movie about Madoff the main thing is the story has to be linear, non confusing and thorough and this 2 part miniseries succeeds. It introduces enough characters one by one to show the major players in the scandal, how the business duped clients and how it came crashing down. It isn't too complicated so non finance people can roughly understand what happens. Madoff is made to be the narrator of the movie and it helps to make things clear. Victims, clients, whistle blowers, the SEC dropping the ball, and the perpetrators in Madoff's company are all shown. The look at what happened in Madoff's own family is quite fascinating. His wife kids brother niece are all shown to be unknowing victims. The tragic suicide of his son Mark is quite moving. Would have liked a bit more about the recovery of the stolen money at the end.",/review/rw3414349/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2016,natalierosen,10," A Dickensian Name -- Madoff an enigmatic tragedy
","If the great master, Charles Dickens, were alive I do not think even he could ascribe an appellation to a person that would fittingly characterize the very essence of the anti-hero as does the name Madoff. Yes, Bernie Madoff, the man who single handedly pulled off the greatest Ponzi schemes in human history and fraudulently MADE OFF with so many innocents' money which he laundered to the tune of 65 Billion, yes, with a ""B"" bucks.",/review/rw3414349/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2016,afijamesy2k,10," Madoff is magnificent
","Out of all of the great TV shows, mini series and TV movies this year, this has got to be the best one this year bar none, Richard dreyfuss in one of the best performances since the goodbye girl back in the 70's, where he won a Oscar for that role, plays Bernie Madoff a man who was sentence to 150 years in prison for tax for running a Ponzi scheme, the teleplay is one of the best teleplays in recent TV history and the performances are all wonderful as always, the writing is crisp, the pacing is great and the editing is marvelous, it's a shame that he wasn't nominated for a emmy for his whole, because he should have been, nevertheless this is definitely the best TV of 2016 bar none I give it my highest rating A+",/review/rw3414349/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2016,kjf2007-1,5," Not enough of the greed or the aftermath is shown
","Considering that they drag this out over nearly 3 full hours you would think you'd see it all. Not nearly enough is shown of how the Madoffs lived high on the hog for decades. And far too much time is spent leading up to the eventual crash and not enough is shown of the aftermath. If Madoff had only preyed upon the filthy rich he would have been far more forgivable, but he took down quite a few smaller folks in his fall from grace. To my way of thinking, Mark Madoff comes off as less redeemable than his father even though Mark supposedly had no knowledge of the ponzi scheme. What sort of son disowns his own father over a white collar crime? ",/review/rw3414349/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2016,SnoopyStyle,7," too long, Dreyfuss great
",Bernie Madoff (Richard Dreyfuss) was a trusted member of Wall Street and the chairman of Nasdaq. It shocked almost everyone when he's revealed to have run a giant Ponzi scheme. His wife Ruth (Blythe Danner) is clueless to the scheme and even his extra-marital affairs. He even cheats money out of his secretary Eleanor Squillari (Erin Cummings). His brother Peter (Peter Scolari) is troubled about his role as Chief Compliance Officer. His older son Mark is angry that he's not allowed to be involved in the company investments. His younger son Andrew also works for him and gets sick. Harry Markopolos (Frank Whaley) warned the SEC over and over again about the possible fraud at Madoff to no avail.,/review/rw3414349/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2016,barbara_kelly,," More Victims
","The movie, as does the media, focuses only on Madoff and his investors and not all the businesses that got ruined because of investments. For example my husband and his co-workers worked at a Oppenheimer funds which had a Hedge Fund heavily invested in Madoff. He did nothing wrong, the company closed and most employees including my husband haven't been able to get a job for over 7 years!!!!!! But the SEC who were distracted by Madoff's history as an icon in the industry didn't do the most basic due diligence. The never checked his trading record, which was ZERO!!! The SEC employees still have jobs from this investigation and many got promotions, what the hell!!!!!!!!!!! The SEC was incompetent, and if they did their job correctly in the early phase of his scam, the depth of consequences wouldn't have been so disastrous. Also last time I checked when you are an auditor and you screw up like the SEC, you get FIRED!!!!!!!!!!!",/review/rw3414349/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2016,cherold,7," Best when it focuses more on cons than family
","Richard Dreyfuss gives a terrific performance as investment con man Bernie Madoff. He's an interesting character, dishonest to the core yet loyal and generous to his friends, although it's unclear whether he was genuinely generous or just interesting in keeping people loyal.",/review/rw3414349/?ref_=tt_urv

1 September 2017,PWNYCNY,10," Great movie. Madoff as scapegoat for a corrupt system.
","This series chronicles a tragedy. A man who is flawed invites disaster to others, and especially to his family. Bernard Madoff did not start out as swindler, but became one. To the movie's credit, it offers a candid and plausible portrayal of the disaster that became Bernard Madoff's life. One comes away from this movie asking: How could he have gotten away with it for so long? Madoff didn't make any special efforts to conceal his activities. He banked the money in a major bank, was audited by government agencies, and his clients were sophisticated investors. Yet, it was only after being turned in by his own sons that the Madoff swindle finally stopped. Richard Dreyfus gives one of the great performances of his career as Bernard Madoff, and Blythe Danner is equally convincing as Ruth. The movie avoids demonizing Madoff, instead portraying him as someone caught up in a process that he could not stop. He knew what he was doing was wrong and kept doing it anyway, as long as he could get away with it. It's what happens when his world begins to crumble that provides the drama and the lessons. As the movie shows, Madoff was not operating in a vacuum. He was operating in the open. As long as his customers and enablers were profiting, no questions were asked. It was only after the scheme collapses and people are losing money that Madoff gets in trouble. And for that, he paid the price.",/review/rw3414349/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2018,jeffyoung1,9," Excellent cautionary tale of dangerous sociopaths among us
","These reviews of the documentary mini-series, MADOFF, range from very good to excellent, with but a few average ones. Many of the people are perceptive and far-thinking in their evaluation of the mini-series, the character, Madoff, the real-life Madoff, and the true-life events around him. I am not going to repeat these great reviews.",/review/rw3414349/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2017,deedee0,8," Best of them all
","This is by far the best production, documentaries included, of the Madoff story. The script was excellent. The information and plot are easy to follow without being weighed down by boring financial specifics. The major players are represented well and the acting is superb. Dreyfuss, Danner, and Rispoli make De Niro, Pfeiffer, and Azaria look like amateurs! I enjoyed the miniseries so much that I wish there were more episodes!",/review/rw3414349/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2021,rogerdob,4," Interesting dramatization but narration ruins it.
","It is interesting to see all the Madoff news events come to life with a group of talented performers...Blythe Danner is especially effetive as Madoffs wife. However, the movie is narrated by the Bernie Madoff character. He is telling us, the viewers, what he is thinking all the time. Unless he was a consultant for this film, the writers had no business interpreting what was going through his mind during his evil actions. I think they gave him a little more sympathy than he deserved.",/review/rw3414349/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2016,MovieHoliks,7," ""Bernie Madoff With All Ma Money!!"" :O :P
","Wow; this is the closest thing I've seen to an ABC ""movie of the week"" in ages! I watched the first half of this two-part mini-series last night. The second half- ""The Fall""- airs tonight. Oscar-winning screen legend, Richard Dreyfuss, plays the financial guru/con artist in this semi-biopic; but mostly covers the events leading up to, and tonight, following, his downfall. I saw a review online that said this movie almost makes you root for Bernie, and it does to an extent. It's actually quite humorous; although at times I get the feeling I'm laughing at parts that weren't meant to be funny-?? LOL Peter Scolari and Blythe Danner co-star.",/review/rw3414349/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2016,jeglerengaw,9," Well Done Madoff TV Movie
","An interesting story based on Bernie Madoff the so called wizard of Wall Street, well played by the entire cast, and informative of what people are willing to do acquiring your money, Madoff may have started out simply trying to impress his friends and family as they stated he had it all before the Ponzi affair, so either he did it and it spun out of control or he became wrapped up in the illusion of his vain wizardry, maybe both, in either case its sad people become so wrapped up and taken so easily by money, never satisfied with what they got, and need something to fill their void of unhappiness, don't pity the poor man, pity the fool, and delusional wizards, the domino effect of the fallout was a atrocity to all the victims, hopefully a lesson to save others in the Madoff's of the future.",/review/rw3414349/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2016,littlebytesawards,10," Dreyfus carries Madoff
","Good movie that moves between the real life case against Bernie Madoff the father of the largest Ponzi scheme in history, and the movie. Catch the acting in this well done movie, but none better than that of Richard Dreyfus playing Bernie Madoff. Mr. Dreyfus came out of retirement to play the part and a great job he does, becoming the sociopath Madoff. But that is not to say the rest of the cast is not up to the job. Honorable Mention behind Mr. Dreyfus is Blythe Danner as Ruth Madoff. She not only looks the part, but her acting is so well done one begins to believe she is Mrs. Madoff, given the fast pace of the movie and real video footage from the financial crisis. Usually a made for TV movie means some mediocre acting and sometimes substandard writing, but not this time!!! Catch this one and watch Mr. Dreyfus, an Academy Award winning actor, at his very best.",/review/rw3414349/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2016,bahaz-440-352871,8," Great production values for a mini-series
","Expect a couple of Emmys for ""Madoff"", about as classy as it gets in the Mini-Series category. We all knew the story as the film unfolded the story in the background and the people in the foreground. This was a 10 had it not been for the loud music over the dialogue and the fact that Dreyfus is just hard to watch, his name being in the dictionary next to ""typecasting."" The story built nicely with the characters increasing the intensity as it moved along, the second half very noticeably stronger than the first half, which was, obviously, strong enough to invite viewers back. After the first half, in a coincidence one just couldn't invent, I watched Dreyfus being interviewed on Fox News Channel by Megyn Kelly. Yes, Fox News Channel. This goes back to the typecasting comment as, after having seen him live, being asked why he attended a Senator Ted Cruz event and hearing him mumble a few derogatory comments, Dreyfus proved he is not a very pleasant fellow. Not, in fact, nearly as nice as Bernie Madoff.",/review/rw3414349/?ref_=tt_urv
