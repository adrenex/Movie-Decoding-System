27 March 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," wow can't believe all the hate reviews
","This film was a great finale for the Maze Runner triology series. I'm not sure why all the hate, it was in line with the last film, yet still not as good as the first one. But certainly not worth all the 1's! Awesome special effects and cinematography, great directing and on point acting. Sure the ending was a little mushy, but still a great and enjoyable watch. A well deserved 8/10 from me.",/review/rw4056654/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2018,ThomasDrufke,6," A Fitting Finale
","I'm glad that the filmmakers still found a way to release The Death Cure and not go straight to digital/on demand. It's not that I think this trilogy is among the best post apocalyptic series nor did I really have an ounce of excitement going in, but after Dylan O'Brien had his accident and over 2 years of fans waiting, the ending is here.",/review/rw4056654/?ref_=tt_urv

18 February 2018,tha_hawk,1," Maze Runner: The What Now?
",Generic. Filler scenes. No story. Random events unfolding in random order. People looking out through windows. People looking towards the horizon. Somebody cries and then somebody says something heroic but entirely without meaning. People pointing guns at each other without actually intending to pull the trigger. Not a single word of original dialogue. Royalty free filmscore from Youtube. Underwritten love story and underwritten characters. Hollywood executives laughing on their way to the bank.,/review/rw4056654/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2018,atomikbuster,5," 2 and a half hours of cliche after cliche
","All you're gonna see in this movie is a continuous stream of cliches.
Sure, if it was released say, in 1970, when none of the superhero/sci-fi/fantasy that today is flooding the audiences was present, it would have been quite enjoyable and watchable.
But in today's market it brings nothing new. I could constantly guess what was going to happen at the end of certain action scenes, and don't even get me started about the helicopter scene... that one was supposed to be dramatic and some kind of fitting twist but just left me enraged at the stupidity of the screenwriters/adaptation.",/review/rw4056654/?ref_=tt_urv

","A fine end to the trilogy. The acting, camera work, cinematography and VFX are the best part, after the engaging screenplay with heart and love.

13 May 2018,siderite,5," A weak an predictable ending to a saga that no one cared about anymore
","Yes, it's a young adult story. Yes, it's got all the shortcomings of lazy writing. Yes, it's all incredible beautiful teens fighting the evil uncaring adults who envy them their youth. And with all that, Maze Runner had something in the first movie that made me want to watch it. Some sort of story, maybe the acting, maybe the whole thing. I just enjoyed it. So I watched the second movie to see what happens and then this piece of crap from pure inertia. And it was just not worth it.",/review/rw4056654/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2018,jimmycoffin-751-212853,1," Another predictable washed out franchise
","Mazerunner has overstayed it's welcome.
It started out as a B-movie with mildly ok cgi effects. Always shadowed
over by the more popular hunger games.
There Isn't even a exciting mazes for them to overcome In any of the sequels 
wich Is very very bad, cause that was the only part that drew me in to see the first movie. Why it's even called the mazerunner Is beyond me.
Here you have a very bland end generic teenager action flick as al the rest.
Every scene is predictable and you know exactly the main characters gonna get saved in the last minute. There's no buildup of suspension or anything.
I give this a 1 star. cause I couldnt even sit through the whole movie.",/review/rw4056654/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2018,dan428,2," Remarkably dumb and drawn out
","I saw this movie at an IMAX theater for $4 as part of T-Mobile promotion. It honestly was only barely worth that. The entire movie was extremely predictable and just plain stupid. I don't know if it's accurate to the book and I haven't seen the other parts of the series, but the script was just ridiculous. ",/review/rw4056654/?ref_=tt_urv

","Maze Runner: The Death Cure is the third and last part of the trilogy centered around a group of teenagers immune to a virus that has decimated mankind who are hunted down by an organization that wants to conduct brutal experiments on them. I have read quite a few negative reviews about this film but let me tell you that this movie is very good conclusion to the franchise and if you liked the first two films, you will certainly appreciate this final installment as well.",/review/rw4056654/?ref_=tt_urv

16 April 2018,TTdood45,2," Not Maze Runner: The Not Zombie Cure
","This is my first review on IMDb and maybe my last but I would just like to selfishly join in on the fun of kicking the dead horse.
Just to be clear I haven't read the books nor am I usually a fan of the subgenre of ""dystopian future saved by young people overthrowing tyrannical rulers"".
I watched the first 2 movies back to back the same day and watched the third the day after. Needless to say the second and third movies are actual trash while the first has it's merits. 
The first Maze Runner worked well enough because it only provided enough information to the audience required as well ASKING QUESTIONS. As soon as the series devolved into ""evil big company is putting kids in a maze for literally no reason so they can find a cure for a zombie virus"" it turned into something a middle schooler got a B- on. That's really sad considering I even got tiny feelings of ""Cube"", a cult classic of sci-fi death maze movies, during the first Maze Runner.",/review/rw4056654/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2018,finraziel,4," Starts out great, but then nose dives and drags on too long
","I just watched a Maze Runner marathon, the first two followed by the final instalment. Loved the first one, but hadn't seen the second one yet. I have to say, I didn't think that was anywhere near as bad as it was made out to be.
The third one though? Oh boy... Well, it actually starts out really well! Good action and our heroes are able to make a fist against WCKD in a very satisfying way. Unfortunately, the film ends up dragging on seemingly forever. I feel like at least half an hour could have been cut to make it much better. The second half of the film keeps getting more and more boring.
The biggest problem is that several of the most important characters are completely unbelievable. Janson (Gillen's character) especially seems to make no sense at all. 
Then there is a nagging feeling that the whole thing is completely pointless and our 'heroes' are actually wrong! Now that could be very interesting if done right, but the movie is presented entirely as a young adult good guys vs bad guys film and the fact that they may be wrong is not explored at all. If they'd just done nothing, the world would probably have been a better place, but the movie still pretends that they 'won' and everything is fine now.
Also, the motivations behind why these kids were put in the maze in the first place are barely explored. It's implied that the pressure is needed to trigger their immunity to grow (why that would be so is beyond me), but most of the kids just sat in the Glade peacefully for years.
Instead of exploring those topics, the last half hour or so of the movie is spent watching characters melodramatically stare at each other while war rages around them, inevitably dying because they couldn't get over their teen angst long enough to actually save anyone (except Thomas, he has plot armor).
The film just left me feeling like I watched some dimwits that couldn't see the big picture and the survivors now sit on a beach pretending everything is okay (when most likely the infected will just catch up with them and they'll die because they're just sitting there in a couple of beach shacks)...",/review/rw4056654/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2020,KADC,4," A lesson in how to make anything good just plain dumb instead.
","The acting, directing, script, and overall plot are terrible, but this is typical of big-budget action films and it's not much worse than an MCU film for example. What makes this movie particularly painful to watch, however, is either how much effort must have gone into turning literally every scene needlessly stupid or how little effort was spent to prevent it.",/review/rw4056654/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2019,NotASmartCritic,10," I don't care what people say, this was a masterpiece whatsoever
","This movie is great it deserves a 10/10, this movie doesn't deserve so much hate and this movie is underrated, anyways, When i saw Gally it made me hyped up, and seeing him being a good character made the movie even better, this movie was also sad, action scenes were great, and when Teresa and Newt died, it almost made me cry, i was holding my tears at those scenes, this movie was great i don't care what people say on my opinion because all i care about is that this movie didn't deserve hate",/review/rw4056654/?ref_=tt_urv

","When you can predict the next move in a scene that is supposed to be thrilling. It ain't so thrilling.
The movie was to long. It probably wouldn't hurt cutting it half hour shorter.

2 May 2018,jpachar82,10," Survival of the Fittest
","""In a world full of violence and escape from the corrupt government that is trying to kill you is trying to wipe out the whole world - but only the few are scathed and unblemished."" ¬ That's not a proverb - that comes from me, my words. 
 In 2014, we were introduced to a rogue set of teenagers trying to get by in a maze full of wicked things, until one day a boy shows up to dismantle the maze and to bring down the very government that was keeping them from fulfilling their true purpose in life - survival. 
 In 2015, that same band of teenagers that were stuck in a maze finally gets their purpose to bring down WCKD - the agency that was controlling them and using them to build their own personal army of hybrids to take down the world system. The Scorch Trials would be the undoing of the band of friends, but they came out on top of it all. 
 Now we come to 2018, 3 years later, it's the end and WCKD is back at it again but this time, one girl could change the fate of the way that we look at how we are made. Thomas, the teenage boy who was brought into the maze, the one that helped his friends escape from the maze, now faces the ultimate decision and prize to give up something so precious that it would be the end of him - his blood to change the mutation of the world. 
 In a word: AWESOMENESS! The Maze Runner Series is by far the best dystopian societal movie since The Hunger Games. This movie ends on a high note where the victors come out on top as always. Wes Ball creates this world to the pristine uniqueness and gives us the words off the page all thanks to T.S. Nowlin. The cast, the crew and everyone who had a hand in making this trilogy did a remarkable job. Thank you for letting us dive into this messed up society.",/review/rw4056654/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2018,m-maru,10," The epic finale !
","Excellent great finale of the saga, a brilliant and excellent cast with incredible performances. On the adaptation of the book I have to say that it has few similar scenes but maintains the essence and the most important moments. Incredible as it starts with a brilliant action scene and wonderful photography accompanied by a great soundtrack, without a doubt it is the best movie of the saga. The more than two hours of the film caught me, made me cry, laugh and get excited. It's a great movie from beginning to end, that does not bore at any time. It has an EPIC ending and a great closing of this saga that is one of my favorites. For me, one of the best movies of the year.",/review/rw4056654/?ref_=tt_urv
