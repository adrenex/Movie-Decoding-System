","Not having gotten around to watching ""Stand Up Guys"" before now was a mistake on my behalf, especially given the three acting heavyweighters that stars in the movie; Al Pacino, Christopher Walken and Alan Arkin.",/review/rw3691601/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2012,ligonlaw,10," You Gotta Love Pacino and Walken Together
","""Stand Up Guys"" is a reunion of elderly gangsters. Alan Arkin, Al Pacino and Christopher Walken are in their twilight years, after long careers as mobsters. This Noah Haidle scripted black comedy is a treat for the ears, as these New York wise guys reminisce about the past. The soundtrack of blues greats and Jon Bon Jovi songs is perfectly on point.",/review/rw3691601/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2014,g-bodyl,9," Earns My Appreciation and Respect!
","Stand Up Guys is a low-budget film not only should earn appreciation by the older audience, but it certainly earned mine. I wasn't expecting anything crazy here, but I got a low-key drama featuring three very fine actors admittedly in their twilight years, a relatively good script, some good comedy, and the theme of friends being reunited after 28 years.",/review/rw3691601/?ref_=tt_urv

","I read some of the reviews here, and I think that some who have reviewed this extremely negatively (as in 1/10) are those who appreciate a movie with lots of explosions, and maybe some guys with their tops off, flexing their muscles to accentuate just how tough they are.",/review/rw3691601/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2013,d0wen,9," Walken and Pacino - Just like bacon and eggs but even better
","The film has a nice genuine feel about it, great story, great acting and a great soundtrack that compliments the film and characters! I found myself getting sucked in to the characters and as much as I enjoy seeing Walken act and hearing his dialogue, Pacino was great in this film too. He's not an angry mobster but a likable criminal one of his best films I think. Walken doesn't give us the old stories that we are used to but his presence is just perfection.",/review/rw3691601/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2013,DICK STEEL,10," A Nutshell Review: Stand Up Guys
","It looks like this is the season for comebacks, with old timers and veterans proving a point that they still have it in them to pull off a film, at least with their charisma being top draw, and a bonus if the story does justice to their big screen return. Christopher Walken may had made his mark this year with Seven Psychopaths, but it's not until Stand Up Guys playing opposite Al Pacino and Alan Arkin that truly brought out a finer performance, making this Fisher Stevens directed movie one of the best this year so far in a tale about what it means to be friends.",/review/rw3691601/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2013,dvc5159,6," The lonely streets at night
","One thing about Fisher Stevens' ""Stand Up Guys"" is that how lonely, not only the primary characters are, but also how the locations are. Take for example, a simple scene where Val (Pacino) and Doc (Walken) walk down the barren street in the middle of the night, as if both represent a bygone era.",/review/rw3691601/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2013,tonsu97,7," Great Movie for Older viewers
","I think you need to be around 70 years of age to really enjoy this Movie. I am and I did; I really did. I chuckled and laughed throughout the movie and continued to do so long into the evening as I remembered some of the more memorable scenes. This is a gem of a Movie and brings back a touch of the real movies of yesteryear. No Vampires ; no Zombies; no computer designed sets and monsters, no excruciatingly LOUD music and noises; just a simple story well told with real ACTORS. I could have sat through it again as soon as it was over....and I may go again. Some of these ""Critics"" need to age a bit to really understand the difference that a Movie like this can bring to its audience",/review/rw3691601/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2013,mekjd,8," Awake, Sleeping Giant!
","I won't pretend to avidly follow new movie releases, but I am shocked that this movie, which is a superbly written and executed (pun intended) story about lifelong friendship, did not generate more attention. Is it because Pacino, Arkin and Walken are perceived to be past their red carpet primes themselves? I hope not! Doing for others because they are friends, with full knowledge of their flaws, is something we might want to consider more frequently. And what could be better than to do so with wit and great fun at the local house of ill repute? All things modernized since one character entered his long journey (close to three decades in prison) are underscored without being condescending. And ultimately, justice and mercy triumph.",/review/rw3691601/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2013,marinkojason,10," Great ! Loved it!
",I got out to the theater to catch this movie and could not of been more pleased. I laughed hysterically at the cynical humor and really enjoyed how as the story progressed I really got ensconced into these characters. Loved beginning to end. I especially enjoyed Vanessa Ferlito's(deathproof) appearance I look forward to see much more of her in future films. Allan Arkin was a great compliment to Pacino and Walkens lead. I found it unfortunate that on opening day of this movie there were only four showtimes.As I awaited entrance at the concession I felt supreme confidence when the previous showing let out and there was nothing but smiles on the faces of the patrons exiting the previous showing.,/review/rw3691601/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2013,oompietseplaas,8," Totally Entertaining
","I'm not one who often writes reviews and I had absolutely no idea what to expect from this Movie. What can I say - Pacino was Spectacular and Walken is - well, he's Walken. As brilliant as he was in The Deer Hunter. The Duo make a stunning and very humorous Duo and certain parts of the Movie will definitely have you in stitches. I'm not going to say anything about the plot but I highly recommend this Movie to any potential Viewers. Filled with Witty Humour and sharp Sarcasm, the Movie tends to get one thinking about different aspects of Life. A Fun Movie - and though a bit slow, I was fixed on the Screen. Pacino and Walken make some of the Newer Actors look like true Amateurs - Watch it - You'll Love it!!",/review/rw3691601/?ref_=tt_urv

24 July 2013,Buddy-51,4," Out of respect for the stars, take a pass on this movie
","I guess that ""Stand Up Guys"" is intended to be Al Pacino and Christopher Walken's version of ""The Bucket List,"" since apparently every aging male movie star is required to have one before wrapping up his career. And true to the body of work of these two seminal actors, this outing takes the form of a crime comedy/drama, in which they portray geriatric gangsters, one (Walken) retired and the other (Pacino) just paroled after 28 years in the slammer (I use the word ""slammer"" intentionally in an attempt to capture at least some of the anachronistic flavor of this throwback to a bygone era of gangster-movie melodrama). It turns out that Walken has only been allowed to live all these years on the condition that he whack Pacino for killing the only son of an equally decrepit mob boss played by Mark Margolis.",/review/rw3691601/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2013,ssodivad-1,8," Yeah!! definitely better than bacon and eggs

29 August 2013,Rodrigo_Amaro,6," Walken & Pacino & Arkin. We can't ask for more. We should. But we can't.
","Three legends. Three Oscar winners directed by another Oscar winner (Fisher Stevens won as producer for a documentary). United in one movie. That should be enough and one should expect maybe just a decent script and then fine. ""Stand Up Guys"" promises too much while securing Al Pacino, Christopher Walken and Alan Arkin in the front row but delivers less than expected with its usual crime/comedy elements focusing on aging criminals and very few to say. The cast chemistry is good (but Pacino already had movies with the other guys, sharing scene with Arkin in ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" and with Walken in ""Gigli"" although they don't share scenes in that thing) and it's probably the only reason why everybody wants to see this movie",/review/rw3691601/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2013,samerku,8," A wonderful ride, aging young guns on their last adventure
","Stand Up Guys is a true reminder of what film should be like: an entertaining experience that keeps you on your seat until the very end, and does a bit of everything else; it makes you laugh, touches you, and makes you wonder, and tops it off with theatrics that you accept delightfully. The script of the movie represents the simplest form of complexity. A director's masterpiece, for those who can appreciate the plot in the details. Acting is beyond praise, as everyone is on board, fully engaged in their roles. Everything makes sense, even the almost supernatural energy of the three aging musketeers. It's been such a long time since I've seen a film and at the end of thought that I wanted some more of it. Walken plays a great role at gluing everything together. Fisher Stevens has got the hang of good film making.",/review/rw3691601/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2013,pixrox1,8," Butch and Sundance . . . with walkers!!
","People in my audience laughed and clapped after this real crowd pleaser. Though there is lots of shooting,fighting, and sex, the camera reveals no nudity and very little blood. Instead, everything from the kind of erection all the TV ads are warning about to the fearful continuous spectre of death haunting those in the advanced stages of senior citizenship are dealt with a plausibility and tastefulness seldom seen in movies featuring 20-somethings pretending to be teenagers (becuase if they actually WERE teenagers, authorities in Oklahoma would ring the theater managers up on kiddie porn charges). STAND UP GUYS is well plotted. Most of the twists and turns meet with audience approval. Though it has that a-tale-of-a-death-foretold motif from the get go, this story is not 100 per cent predictable. Christopher Walken as Doc seems to have better chemistry with Al Pacino's Val than many of Pacino's other recent co-stars. Alan Arkin's brief bit as Richard is just the icing on the cake. As for my summary, you'll need to wait until the closing scene.",/review/rw3691601/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was instantly attracted to watching this film, when I read about it, because of the two leading actors, I didn't bother to read about the plot, but it was rated well also, so I looked forward to whatever it would be, directed by Fisher Stevens (star of Short Circuit). Basically Valentine, better known as Val (Al Pacino), has been released from serving, having served a 28 year sentence, his old friend and partner Doc (Christopher Walken) is there to pick him up and brings him to his apartment. Doc has been ordered by mob boss Claphands (Breaking Bad's Mark Margolis) to kill Val, Claphands blames Val for the death of his son during a robbery, Doc has until morning to kill him. Val wants make the most of his release, he and Doc visit a local brothel, run by Wendy (Lucy Punch), Val is unable to get it up, so he and Doc break into a drugstore to steal Viagra, they return to the brothel and Val spends time with a younger woman. Val next wants to party, so he and Doc go to a nightclub, Val has a slow dance with a younger woman, Val passes out snorting some pills, Doc sees this as an opportunity to kill him, instead he takes Val to hospital, the head nurse is Nina (The Good Wife's Julianna Margulies), the daughter of their old friend Hirsch (Alan Arkin). Afterwards Val and Doc go to a local diner, Val correctly guesses that Doc has been hired to kill him, Doc confesses he has until 10:00am to do the job, or else he will be killed as well. After stealing a black Dodge Challenger SRT8, they go to get Hirsch, who used to be their getaway driver, Hirsch takes the wheel, they avoid a highway chase with the police, Hirsch is asked what he wants to do, as a widow he chooses the brothel, he has not slept with anyone since the death of his wife. After leaving, the three men hear noises coming from inside the car's trunk, it is a naked woman named Sylvia (Vanessa Ferlito), she was kidnapped and abused, Val and Doc go to find the men responsible, shooting a couple of them, tying them up, and leaving them with Sylvia, who gets her revenge with a baseball bat. Back at the car, they find Hirsch dead, they break the news to Nina, she helps them bury him at the cemetery, then they return to the diner, Doc makes a phone call to Claphands, begging him to show Val mercy, since he has only a few years left, Claphands threatens his granddaughter Alex (Addison Timlin), a waitress at the diner, if he does not complete the job, she is unaware of their relation. Doc leaves a letter and his house keys in an envelope for Alex, the sun is rising, Doc stops in a church to give a priest his confession, and next he and Val break into a tailor shop for new suits, two of Claphands' thugs interrupt them, pestering Doc to finish the job, he and Val shoot them. Alex goes to Doc's apartment, Doc calls her there, he says she was the inspiration for his sunrise paintings, he has left a shoe box full of cash and the rent has been paid for a year in advance, now knowing their relation she calls him grandfather, he says he loves her and hangs up. In the end, Val and Doc stroll towards Claphands' warehouse, drawing pistols and opening fire, a firefight commences, Val and Doc fire at Claphands and his men, and are shot in the process, it is unclear how it ends, as the camera pans up to the sunrise, turning into one of Doc's paintings. Also starring Katheryn Winnick as Oxana and Bill Burr as Larry. Pacino and Walken make a terrific double act as best buddies and partners in crime, Arkin is just about as great in the short time he gets, it is a nice simple story of an old friendship tested by one of the men potentially forced to do a job he doesn't want to, they have an entire night of fun to recapture the good old days, and there is plenty of room for guns and gangsters, it is funny and very smartly written, a terrific crime comedy drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for ""Not Running Anymore"" by Jon Bon Jovi. Very good!",/review/rw3691601/?ref_=tt_urv
