4 February 2022,FeastMode,2," If you take parts of 20 other movies and mash them together
","I'm a sci-fi junkie and I can enjoy a stupid, mindless action flick. I still find Armageddon highly entertaining to this day. I'm the kind of person who loves these kinds of movies. Except when they're complete trash like this one.",/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2022,benjaminskylerhill,3," Hilariously bad, and kinda fun because of it
","It's been quite some time since I've seen a cast full of talented, well-regarded actors all give performances that are this terrible. To be fair, given this dialogue, I don't think any actor could have pulled off a good performance.",/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2022,JoBloTheMovieCritic,6," Moonfall
","6/10 - with the visuals of a true space blockbuster, this B movie features nonsensical dialogue, many many charcaters that serve absolutely no purpose, and an absolutely insane third act...but nonetheless, it's fun.",/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2022,siderite,7," I believe everybody doing this film was having an insane amount of fun (and possibly drugs)
","Roland Emmerich likes to have fun and blow up large stuff. With Moonfall, he blows up the Moon itself! Well, sort of. If you want this film to make sense, to show artistic qualities or make you ponder important questions about the nature and origin of humanity, you're in the wrong place. Instead, you have to imagine Emmerich as a little child who was given toys and who creates a completely bogus story that uses all of them together to maximum entertainment effect. That is it. You either laugh your behind off and enjoy the show or this movie is not for you.",/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2022,lareval,1," Trashfall
","Another Emmerich mess. A Big budget wasted in a sloppy execution and a handful of stars acting by paycheck won't save a hollow script. I wonder how many professional or talented amateur writers found their work denied and how on Earth (or Moon if you like) scripts like this are produced. Rubbish! And I'm not insulting anyone, I'm just judging what I saw.",/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2022,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,5," I guess I like these kinds of movies, even though they're silly.
","I don't think it's a bad movie. The effects were great. The movie Ã¼as just too long, longer than necessary. The subject of the movie is, of course, very, very, very ridiculous, but so are many movies too. I enjoyed watching the movie with my snacks and beer. I guess I like these kinds of movies, even though they're silly.",/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2022,SnoopyStyle,5," Roland keeps Rolanding
","In 2011, astronaut Brian Harper (Patrick Wilson) is able to save a space shuttle mission from an alien swarm. Back on earth, he is betrayed by fellow astronaut Jocinda Fowler (Halle Berry) and gets blamed for human error. It's ten years later. Brian is a shell of himself. Conspiracy theorist KC Houseman (John Bradley) discovers that the moon's orbit is deteriorating and headed for earth. He tries to recruit Brian to contact NASA.",/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2022,Xavier_Stone,1," Absolutely an abomination
","1 star dialogue. ""you do know how to start a car right?"" she says. And he replies, ""I should warn you, I had my license revoked."" Smirk.",/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2022,661jda,3," Please take the camera away from Roland Emmerich...
","Or give him a screenwriter. This is absolutely the biggest piece of trash yet. Extremely poor writing filled with cliches, trite comments, expected plots and the comic second banana. And the plot???? Gawd!!!!! The moon is hollow???? I spent part of the time. They've resusitated the characters for 2012 and INDEPENDENCE DAY and given them a new plot twist. It was so bad, I almost left halfway thru, (and I got in for free), but I decided to stay because I wanted to match the currect characters with those in the other films. Wait til it shows up on tv in 4 weeks and then for $5.99 groan with the friends and family. This is a stinker - 3 stars is generous!",/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2022,iamianiman,2," Just when you thought Fast 9 is the most ridiculous movie ever made...
","Watching the trailer, I stuck with Zendaya's MJ's rule; 'Expect disappointment so that you can never really be disappointed.' Except that this was beyond worse than what we had imagined.",/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2022,morcego,1," A Kaspersky and Lexus Ad with the scientific depth of sharknado
","Do you know those movies that are so bad, they are good? This isn't one of them. This is just bad.",/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2022,Nagitokomeda,2," I cannot describe how bizarre and bad this film is
","I really can't express how much I hated this film. I went in with my brain turned off, expecting a dumb fun disaster film with some crazy fun set pieces. Instead the first hour was a dour slog with uninteresting characters, while the second half was utterly insane (in a bad way).",/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2022,MrDHWong,4," Ranks among the stupidest, most ridiculous movies to come from a director like this, and that's saying something
","""Moonfall"" is a sci-fi disaster film directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"", ""The Day After Tomorrow"", ""2012""). Starring Halle Berry, Patrick Wilson, and John Bradley, it ranks among the stupidest, most ridiculous movies to come from a director like this, and that's saying something.",/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2022,Tweetienator,5," Big Bang Style
","If you watch a disaster movie made by Roland Emmerich you get what you expect: big explosions, fine work by the special departments and a rather simple story with forgettable characters. Moonfall is no exception - get your coke and pop-corn, lay back and enjoy the show. But in the case you don't like that kind of big screen disaster movies, don't bother.",/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2022,drael64,6," Fun, and not terribly serious
","This is a fun action ride, with good pacing, decent enough acting and a not particularly serious tone. The plot points range through a whole bunch of fun conspiracy theories and other ideas. This is not hard science fiction obviously, but if you can suspend disbelief for a marvel movie and just enjoy the ride, you can do the same here. You won't be bored.",/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2022,arnonatte,7," No brainer sci-fi popcorn shizzle.
","So if you want to enjoy this movie ,disable your brain for a few hours,and let it all happen.",/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2022,kosmasp,6," Independence Moonmargeddon
",Emmerich - who you gonna hire when it comes to a movie of this kind and calibre? I mean one is almost tempted to say that he is doing one thing in different forms/movies. There are elements from so many other movies here. Be it in the characters or the themes of the movie. The important question though is: can you suspend your disbelief? And I don't mean just a little! I am talking about all the way here.,/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2022,Homer_Ate2,1," Anti science / NASA hit piece?
","This movie was terrible to watch. I know it's Sci fi, but that doesn't mean the film or actors shouldn't be grounded in reality. Suspension of disbelief can only take the audience so far.",/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2022,RunningFromSatan,5," Arthur C. Clarke worthy idea, ""Troll 2"" worthy writing and directing
","Being a Millennial, I can attest to our generation that it was a great time to be alive with ""Independence Day"" and ""Godzilla"" being some of our favorite tween-age blow-up-knock-down action movies to go see with our friends in the theater 3 times in the same day, with campy yet lovable characters like Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. Those were the days. I still enjoy watching those flicks from time to time - not just for the nostalgia. They are still quite entertaining in their own right.",/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2022,eddie_baggins,4," Catwoman, Ed Warren and Samwell Tarley save the world in this preposterous blockbuster
",It may seem far too early in the year to be claiming such things but it's going to take something truly special (seriously random) for my personal favorite final scene of the year to be anything but Moonfall's need to be seen effort.,/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2022,851222,7," Fun guilty pleasure
",Greetings from Lithuania.,/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2022,jared-25331,1," This is an atrocious movie even for Roland Emmerich!
","This film is feels like a parody of other Roland Emmerich. It honestly feels like Roland Emmerich saw F9 (2021) & he made this film just to say, You people think that F9 was a stupid film, you thought that was stupid crap, well guess what I'm going to make something even more stupid."" This was 2-hours of stupidity that I chose to fast forward a lo t of the film just to shorter my suffering. Overall, Moonfall (2022) is an abysmal film & it's easily Roland Emmerich's 2nd worst film behind Godzilla (1998).",/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2022,sbweightman,2," More like Moonfail
","Entertaining plot concept but either far too serious and too slow with not enough crazy or exciting moments or far too preposterous to be taken seriously. The special effects are sometimes spectacular but nothing new, the plot has major issues and the pacing is awful as it jumps back and forth between the different groups. The leads are ok, but the supporting character are poorly written and acted and the few jokes weren't funny.",/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2022,Instant_Palmer,1," Don't Waste Your Time or Money. Simply AWFUL
",Cannot be a worse movie out right now. I tried three times to watch and finish the film. Couldn't do it. I BOUGHT this movie to see it early. HUGE lapse in judgement on my part. It's simply unbearably bad. Not bad like the 1960s classic sci-fi films that were bad in a funny way. Just plain bad bad. ð,/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2022,willandcharlenebrown,1," Garbage
",Worst movie I've seen in so many years. Horrible acting and horrible screen play. This movie was rushed and ridiculous. Please don't waste your time. There is a ridiculous scene involving an oxygen tank. You'll see. Insult to our intelligence.,/review/rw7857504/?ref_=tt_urv
