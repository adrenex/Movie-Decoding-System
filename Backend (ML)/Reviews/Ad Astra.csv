17 July 2020,Aettea,," Great potential but insufferably slow paced
","It only needed 4 episodes tops, maybe 3. I detest when creators deliberately stretch plots to get multiple seasons. Do it right or don't do it at all.",/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2021,Rob_Taylor,4," Bore of the Worlds
","I wanted to like this. I made it through season 1 without too much problem (more on that in a moment) but I'm afraid season 2 did for me. Currently just finished episode 4 and I had to fast forward through some of it, just like the previous episodes.",/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2019,Scunner,," Aliens hate Nick Cave.
",Scientists broadcast Nick Cave into space and the aliens hate it so much they turn up and try to wipe out all of humanity.,/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2020,efd-10467,5," My first review was 3 episodes in now after more, yes, it's boring
","I've stopped watching, why doesn't someone fix a car or even use a bike, why aren't the bodies rotting and flies everywhere, why when the stay some where does someone leave a door open or go outside against all common sense and warnings, why do the machines make noise sometimes but at other times quietly sneak up on people, why are most of the female characters always doing stupid out of control things, where is all the ammunition from ? Why don't they ever sit down like adults and make a plan, do they people ever bath ? Why would you aimlessly wander from spot to spot, when you know you are going to be attacked, why wouldn't you heavily question the people who obviously have some gift or insight into the invaders and use it to your advantage.",/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2019,s3276169,4," War of the witless......
","After the travesty that is the BBC's The War of the Worlds, you might have thought the French could have done better but, its seems, mediocrity is contagious.",/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2019,chris-h-3,7," Would've liked to have seen more of everything.
",I enjoyed the first half of this series a lot. Even though is shares next to nothing with the book (if anything its closer to Day of the Triffids) the characters were original and much of the set up didn't go with the normal tropes and characters you see in this kind of programme.,/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2019,Athanatos173,7," Interesting British/French Production
","I have to say I had an advantage in that I speak both English and French fluently, therefore I did not need subtitles, but the story itself is interesting enough that I don't believe subtitles would diminish the experience.",/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2019,Theo Robertson,7," Wildly Uneven Sci-Fi Thriller With A Misleading Title
","Having recently seen the BBC version of THE WAR OF THE WORLDS I knew there was also another version of HG Wells story being produced at the same and was advertised as a ""reimagining"" . It couldn't possibly be worse than the BBC turkey but I don't like the word ""reimagining"" and the lukewarm early reviews on this page meant I almost gave it a miss. I did get round to seeing it and I'm in two distinct minds as to what I've seen",/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2020,mau-26,3," Lacks of everything
","You would think that in a TV show about the downfall of our civilization, the emotions and merits of people would be portrayed. But in fact all the characters you meet here are colorless and boring, even unappealing. They hardly talk at all, the dialogues are practical at best - if there are any at all. It feels as if a person with social attachment disorder wrote the script.",/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2019,Snowraven69,1," Sigh!!
","This is the sound I made during each episode after forcing myself into watching the next one in the hope that the show would improve then realise 5 minutes into each episode that 45 minutes of tedium awaited me.... ""Sigh"" Each sigh lasted 45 minutes, I'll say no more.Is it over yet?",/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2020,jani-varpujarvi,2," Stupid characters
","This is quite boring serie.
I was watching it with my son, otherwise I would have quit after 2 or 3 episodes.
Why are they being so stupid?!
They dont try to lisen news from radio. They doesnt care much of storing food, water or medic. They do not try to contact authorities. They do not search other survivors and setup rescue centers.
And that older man makes me to want to yell. He is like zombie, doesnt have but one expression, doesnt seem to know how to speak. So irritating I would slap him.
And 10 soldiers cant shoot one ""dog"", but one woman makes it in seconds.
Just stupid.
I dont mind low budjet or lack of effects in movies, but stupidity...",/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2019,apollosdei,3," Even the actors seem bored and not convinced of the plot
","Let's forget for a moment all the technological and pseudoscientific inconsistencies these types of shows may have, as usual: that's no excuse for unrealistic characters who behave in poorly believable ways; on top of that, they have no depth and whatever authors try to do to give them some humanity, is trite and pathetic. For example: You would see people with more angst, sense of urgency and perspective of reality on people who lost a fly abroad than with these characters. The plot is stupid too and makes no sense on top of the aforementioned lack of alien (and human) technological consistency. You feel sorry for the actors because some of them, at least, have to deal with a useless material to work with and obviously the direction is horrible. There are film shorts that work miracles in 10 minutes, this TV show doesn't know what to do in so many episodes. And, of course, there is no War of the Worlds of anything close to it.",/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2021,akira-hideyo,7," Huh???
","Just watched S02 finale. I dropped to a 6, from my previous 7 rating for decent effort and goodwill. Logic wise, I tried really hard to make sense of why the concept of choosing to eradicate your own kind instead of remedying the past. And to focus the entire cause of the apocalyptic mission based upon just 2 genetically defective teens is stretching the cerebral vortex a wee too much. Anyways, I did prefer this world ending over what a post Brexit or even post Covid future could possibly look like. Yikes!",/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2020,arfdawg-1,3," Ultimately Disappointing
","The series starts out really promising but by the 5th episode it becomes a unbearably boring, slow moving wreck.",/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2019,garodardavis-08913,6," If it was not called War of the Worlds, no one would complain
","First I want to say that I am quite disappointed that the show completely reimagined what the book was about. The aliens are not martians, there most likely are no tripods and the aliens look like robots.",/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2019,iliasalk,4," Another mediocre adaptation
","Which has nothing to do with the original book. You have a bunch of people running, to escape from the metal dog like aliens, but even after the final episode, no one has a clue who are the aliens and why they invade earth. The show Is slow, very boring and confusing. I hope, if there will be a 2nd season, somebody will explain to the poor audience, why they had to endure the first 8 episodes.",/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2021,jtags-84059,2," First season ok than its downhill
",The first part of season was ok even with the weird robot dogs but once its revealed the aliens are English speaking aliens complete with accents it just descended into ridiculous. Add to that the whole premise doesn't make any sense with the Aliens coming to save themselves and needing foetuses to recover but hey decide to kill 99.9% of the population when all they could have done was go to the local abortion clinic and have had more than enough material to cure themselves a 1000 times over with a ready supply on tap instead of looking for pregnant women amongst the .1% leftover. Its obvious the writers are no making it up as they go along and didn't have the budget for proper aliens.,/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2021,frankblack-79961,3," Interesting take on a classic. Extremely poor execution.
","If most of the stupidity of characters was removed it would be good. As it is, wow. Soldiers that don't have protocols or even walk on patrol in a realistic formation. People hiding who leave doors wide open. Oh, the funniest one... Some folks can empty clips into aliens and no effect, while others can drop them in one or two shots. Aliens that cant break into a room braced by a mop handle but can punch dents into thick steel doors. The list is endless. 1 season will be enough for me. Too frustrating to keep going.",/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2020,luckybuccaneer,7," Why the hate!?
",I cannot understand the hate for this show. I get that it's not War of the Worlds in the Wells sense and if you're expecting an action series then this is not for you.,/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2019,Turanic,5," Black Mirror did it better in 1 episode
","The show starts brilliant, at the end of episode 2 it still has a certain plot development then in episode 3 this slows down to a still... If you expect Tom Cruise ""War of the worlds "", don't, in fact this seems worse than a single robodog episode of Black Mirror which had plenty of decent action, what it feels like is ""Walking dead"" without Zombies with pretty boring characters - you have A Mom with two children, a 40 years old guy and an elderly scientist, by far the elderly scientist is the most intresting character in the show, I do not think I will be watching this after episode 3, I've seen it before...",/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2020,OmniCognateSnr,10," I really don't understand the negative reviews
","Not all sci-fi is lasers and spaceships. I really don't understand why this is getting so many negative reviews. I accept it has only a parsing resemblance to the original ( well, mainly just the title ) but that aside this is a really good suspense show. Maybe some people don't like reading the occasional sub titles or don't like the heavy drama, or possibly the fact that the main protagonists dont seem to care much who they kill but for me this is an excellent series. War of the Worlds was the first ""grown up book"" i ever read, and i live around the area it was set, so i have a real love of the original and I really wish someone would have a go at making a proper version of it, but if you can ignore the title this is a great show.",/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2020,mhorg2018,1," First two episodes nearly put me in a coma
","Boring beyond belief! An utter waste of a decent cast, calling this war of the worlds is an insult to H.G. Wells book, the brilliant George Pal 53 movie and the classics comics illustrated adaptation. I gave up after the talky, boring, first two episodes. I can't believe this is getting positive reviews of any kind. 'Pulse Pounding,'? More like pulse stopping. This is as bad as Spielberg's abomination or that BBC bore fest.",/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2020,mrjmartin,1," How many times before they get it right???
","(Contains Spoilers)
Another exercise in extreme tedium!",/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2020,johntacchi-11227,8," No, it's not H G Wells but it is still good
","I like this show. It grows on you. It has now whizzy special effects and if you want those, watch the Tom Cruise film. The tension here is that you don't see the aliens. Throughout you are left wondering who they really, why are they here and what do they want? It is a drama about people and what they might do facing the end of the world.
Good cast with plenty to work with and they bring out the human element to the story. Dramatic tension is maintained and there is a haunting soundtrack. Interesting British/French co-production which brings out the idea that this is something across the whole world and not just a corner of it. If you feel it is a bit slow at the start, stay with it. It's worth it.",/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2020,martintallon-62-398805,8," Not War of the Worlds, maybe War for the Earth
","War of the Worlds is typically owned between Earth & Mars which this is not even close. As a SciFi show it's OK, but it seems it was named to steal ratings from the BBC release of the same name. Just like C W Howell does with his movies using the same or almost same name as a box office hit to lure people in to watch only to find out they got duped. Anyway It's not that bad, No SciFi is bad except maybe the so named channel with wrestling and paranormal garbage and very little actual SciFi, but that's another comment section. If you like SciFi you may like this, just ignore the title and you'll be fine.",/review/rw5609345/?ref_=tt_urv
