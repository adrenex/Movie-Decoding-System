20 December 2020,ThomDerd,7," Cult-y and strange.
","Slow start, but the end made it kind of worth it.
This is the style of film that you want to follow to see how it concludes. There is an eerie vibe throughout and the dialogue itself makes this movie interesting. If you like films which involve cults then you will be interested enough to watch this, although there's more to its story then just a cult. I did like the fact that the protagonists are also the directors/writers of the film, it gives an extra touch to their acting. 7/10, a low budget film that delivers.",/review/rw4275679/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2017,planktonrules,8," A rather amazing film.
","Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead wanted to make a film. The problem is that they're newcomers to filmmaking and didn't have the millions it usually costs to make a movie. So, they chose to star in the film, direct, produce and Benson wrote the script! In addition, although the film has some sci-fi/supernatural elements, they managed to create some stunning special effects on the cheap! Watching it is like a lesson on economical filmmaking...and it's a darned good film to boot!",/review/rw4275679/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2019,Sleepin_Dragon,7," Rather good to be honest.
","I'm almost pained to watch ant film that has the tag of horror on it, as the results are so often a disappointment. The Endless however, had something I've longed for, and a level of originality that seems so rare these days",/review/rw4275679/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2017,dfranzen70,7," A must-see for fans of the warping of time and space
","Two grown brothers, who escaped a cult when they were kids, receive a video from same cult, enticing them to return. The older Justin (Justin Benson) has vivid and terrible memories of their time with the group, but younger Aaron (Aaron Moorhead)has just hazy memories of pleasant times. So, despite Justin's wishes, the two do in fact return to the compound they left a decade earlier. But why are they being summoned back? Are their lives (again) in danger? Or has the cult changed into just being another Northern California commune? When the brothers arrive in the middle of nowhere, they find the de facto leader Hal (Tate Ellington), who explains that the group has prospered in the years since Aaron and Justin left. Their primary source of income? Homemade beer. Very hipster. The members of the small commune/cult each have their own special skill, whether it's painting, knitting, magic tricks. The list is pretty finite, actually.",/review/rw4275679/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2018,kosmasp,8," Resolution
","I have not seen the Spring movie yet (I bought it because it got recommended to me by a lot of people), but I have seen the previous stand alone future movie they did - Resolution. And let's say it did prepare me for this. Because while this looks like one thing and kind of is, there are layers upon layers to this. Usually when directors act in their own stuff, in low budget movies especially, nothing much comes out of that.",/review/rw4275679/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,6," Interesting, but not exciting.
","The writing had flaws and the acting by Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead was too stale (they should've just stuck to directing). The 111 min run time felt like 180 mins. The pace should have been faster and the film edited down to 90 mins max. The Directing and cinematography however was very good and the overall story concept was interesting. Sure it's a low budget film, but most of the flaws wouldn't cost much to avoid/fix. It's a 6/10 from me.",/review/rw4275679/?ref_=tt_urv

17 June 2019,truemythmedia,9," Intelligent Thriller
","Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead's ""The Endless"" is about as good as a small budget, horror/sci fi/thriller film can be. It's expertly written and almost perfectly executed; it's incredibly atmospheric; frightening, disturbing, and sometimes surprisingly funny; it's exquisitely paced; and best of all, though the rules of world are bizarre and strange, it all makes sense. Had it not been for one scene- quite literally one scene- this film would've received a perfect score from me.

9 May 2018,howard.schumann,8," The Gods Must be Crazy
","Ignoring Thomas Wolfe's observation that ""You can't go home again,"" brothers Justin (Justin Benson, ""Dementia"") and Aaron Smith (Aaron Moorhead, ""Contracted: Phase II""), as an expression of completion, return to a California cult from which they had escaped ten years ago. Written and directed by Benson and Moorhead, The Endless is a low-budget psychological drama that juggles elements of horror and science fiction, unfolding in a world where reality is malleable and where past, present, and future exist simultaneously. Opening with a quote from legendary fantasy/horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, ""The oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown,"" the film plays with time loops and apocalyptic visions, but its basic element is the relationship between siblings Aaron and Justin and their desire for mutual support.",/review/rw4275679/?ref_=tt_urv

19 October 2019,knhu,8," A gem of a sci fi thriller
","What a great little gem!
I've watched this film three times - something I very rarely do.
What I value the most about this film is the story line. The story is tight, and simple, and clever, which is a lot more than what I can say about many mainstream sci fi blockbusters.
They probably deserve even better rating, given the limited budget they had to work with, in order to get this result. Good work!",/review/rw4275679/?ref_=tt_urv

",Two brothers receive a video from a cult they escaped years earlier. Older brother Justin Smith had pulled his younger brother Aaron out believing the group to be a death cult and insists that they had committed mass suicide. Aaron remembers nothing but good times. Justin admits that he had not actually witness any deaths. They go back to examine their vastly different past experiences. Aaron falls for Anna.

23 April 2018,M_Exchange,5," Ranges from brilliant to ridiculous to horrible
","It ranges from brilliant to ridiculous to horrible-- sometimes during the course of two scenes. I understand the limitations of working with a low budget, and they did a fairly good job of just making a coherent story. I've seen many low budget features and shorts that weren't even coherent, let alone good. ",/review/rw4275679/?ref_=tt_urv

9 July 2018,paulclaassen,8," This WILL have a cult following.
","This is a truly amazing film and will no doubt have a cult following. No pun intended, considering the film is about a secret cult! This was just really incredible. The acting was superbly natural. The cinematography was awesome, as was the visual effects. I enjoyed the fact that the visuals never took over the screen. It was subtle but very, very effective. The film had some seriously freaky moments! Hail to Justin Benson for writing, directing and starring this fantastic film.",/review/rw4275679/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2019,wagdiddy,8," I enjoyed this movie but I have SO Many Questions!
","Wasn't sure I was going to like this---it started off pretty slow. Husband fell asleep pretty quickly but don't read a lot into that: he falls asleep during loud war scenes at the movie theater, too. I thought that Jason and Aaron did a decent job of acting---better than I could do, for sure. Just some holes in the plot that maybe other viewers could fill but I couldn't. I guess I like things nice and neat at the end. Example: these boys grew up there, at this commune that is in an endless loop. While they were visiting, the time frame that they had until they were caught in a loop and would never be able to leave was when those three moons were full. So, why weren't they ever caught in a loop when they were living there for years??? Another: they knew they only had a day before the moons were full. Why weren't they hurrying the hell up? Food: where were the groceries coming from? Did the Deity allow them off the commune to go to the market? What did Justin see at the bottom of the lake? He looked terrified when he came up. He's not going to look that way because he saw a metal box, so what was down there? When Justin went to the Gun Tweaker's cabin and saw Mike there, why didn't he say to Mike immediately upon realizing who he was, ""Hey! Your wife is looking for you! She's staying at the commune hoping to find you!."" If the Deity allows them off the grounds to go to the market and to sell their beer, won't he let Mike hike up the hill a bit to see his wife? Were all the loops different lengths? Why did some have long ones and some have shorter ones? And more questions that I can't think of right now. My Big Thought this morning is: what if this is merely Justin and Aaron's loop??? Hmmmm.",/review/rw4275679/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2018,askanade,7," Different and interesting
","There are no cut and dried answers here, just a mystery and a happening that defies logic but makes you feel that it just might happen somewhere unknown to anyone. What is really happening at this cult, why are some people behaving so strangely, what is the past that has pulled the two brothers back to make sense of it all.",/review/rw4275679/?ref_=tt_urv

15 July 2018,westsideschl,4," What Time is It?
","On a positive rating note the raw idea of spending eternity in a time loop is an interesting plot premise. 
On many negative notes it is worth two to four stars. 
1. Time loops are impossible because they require going back in time - a no-no, but fun to talk (make films) about. Not explained was how they took place; did they effect each person differently; at what age do they come back as; long long do they last; ways of ending it had contradictory outcomes.
2. Cheap special effects of CGI force field bubbles; three moons in the sky; pulling on a rope seemingly stretching out into wherever. First, overused; second, makes no sense; third, still another mystery creator is a film no show; fourth, the reliance on old tech film rolls capable of running backward makes no sense as a visual or causal explanation.
3. Dialogue in trying to be philosophical was all over the place, sort of institutional patient illogical. 2' by 2' chalk blackboard w/single equation as an explanatory hook - nope!
4. Not much of what you could label as acting took place. 
5. Another open ended (meaning they couldn't figure out an ending that makes sense) thus our car running w/no gas suggests ...",/review/rw4275679/?ref_=tt_urv

4 June 2018,augustkellerwrites,7," Niche Following Potential
","The Endless is a film that is easy to get pulled into due to the variety of its techniques and the intention of its direction. A daunting atmosphere is created almost instantly with ominous scoring and dramatic transitions from scene to scene. Tensions rise as the plot carefully creeps along and the cast is given room to hit notes as diverse as comedic and horrifying. However, while the craft of this movie may be clear, the drawbacks are clear as well.",/review/rw4275679/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2018,deloudelouvain,5," A missed opportunity.
","First of all The Endless is not a horror movie so it's not necessary to put it in that genre, something that happens all the time on IMDb and that I quite honestly hate. It's fantasy and sci-fi and that's it. The good things about this movie is the idea of the story, it's intriguing and full of mystery, and the acting was not bad either. The bad thing is that I thought the story was just not elaborated enough, you'll be stuck with unanswered questions and that's never pleasant. It's not that I had to endure this movie, not at all, but it could have been much better. It's a low budget and that shows, with mediocre visual effects. To me it's a missed opportunity to bring a good movie with a mysterious story. But everybody is entitled to his opinion.",/review/rw4275679/?ref_=tt_urv
