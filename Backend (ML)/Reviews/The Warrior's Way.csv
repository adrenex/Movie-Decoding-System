7 November 2010,claudio_carvalho,7," A Tense and Realistic Combination of ""Open Water"" and ""Jaws""
","Luke (Damian Walshe-Howling) welcomes his friend Matt (Gyton Grantley) and his girlfriend Suzie ( Adrienne Pickering) that come from London and Matt's sister and Luke's former girlfriend Kate (Zoe Naylor) that comes from Sydney to sail with him and the sailor Warren (Kieran Darcy-Smith) in a sailboat. However, the vessel hits an underwater rock and capsizes with an opening on her bottom. Luke advises that they should swim in the north direction to reach the Turtle Island, in Queensland, Australia, while they have strength since there is a current moving the stranded boat in the opposite direction of land but Warren prefers to stay on the hull waiting for help since there are sharks in the water. The quartet swims, but they are hunted by a great white shark. ",/review/rw2994474/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2011,vamplad79,8," Better than Open Water....
",Has similar premise as Open Water but is done a lot better. The characters are a lot better (no endless bickering for 3/4 of the movie) and the shark is both a real threat and clearly seen throughout the movie. This was the movie i was hoping Open Water would be.,/review/rw2994474/?ref_=tt_urv

21 November 2010,paul_haakonsen,6," The waters will run red...
","Following in the wake of the popular ""Jaws"" movies, there have been a recent wave of these shark survival/lost at sea movies around. And ""The Reef"" is actually one of the better movies in the genre.",/review/rw2994474/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2010,capoazzurro,8," ""Jaws"" in ""Open Water""
","When I saw, I could be the first one to write a review for this movie, I thought to myself, that's a chance not to let go! And here I go... If you're familiar with horror flicks in general and animal terror-flicks in detail you'll find yourself reminded of the notorious ""Jaws"" (well, of course since it's the godfather of Shark-films), ""Open Water"" and, if you know who the director is, also of his latest film ""Black Water"". To be honest, ""The Reef"" hasn't many similarities to ""Jaws"". It has though many similarities to ""Open Water"", and if you liked that last named, you'll definitely like ""The Reef"". The style of direction here uses perspectives from the point of view of the protagonists and therefor also a lot of shaky-cam. Although this is no revolution in directing anymore, it surely succeeds in adding realism to this movie and giving the audience the feeling of being one of the group. The characters are all very authentic, without the typical stereotypes in the Hollywood-made animal horror-flicks, so it gets very easy to feel sympathy for and identify with the characters (like in ""Black Water""). Because the director probably didn't have the biggest budget to spent for his movie he made clever choices in what to show and what to leave to the imagination of the viewer. It's always better to show effects only if they're worth to show, and so does Traucki in this movie. For example Traucki doesn't show how the yacht capsizes or delivers an exact explanation why it overturns, but not in the way that he's cheating the audience by keeping back important information. He just puts you in the situation of the individuals and doesn't give you the chance of seeing from a bird's perspective what has happened to the yacht. But what he shows to us is very well made. The shark looks, moves and behaves like a shark, like the animal that is the most dangerous predator in the seas, and not like an exaggerated monster from outer space. Unfortunately it's pretty easy to estimate what's happening next in the movie, but that's due to the simple setting in the sea, with water and almost nothing but water. What the film manages very well is getting never boring and holding the audience's attention during the whole duration of the movie. You can say that the movie shouldn't have lasted longer though, the duration is perfect. And now... go and see the movie yourself...or just take a swim!",/review/rw2994474/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2020,Sergiodave,8," Good Movie
","Watched this on Netflix. Really good low budget Shark movie that sits above all other shark flicks except Jaws (1975). The direction and pace of this film is superb with lots of suspense and the acting from all the cast is great, I actually cared for the characters, not something I often feel! Big thumbs up.",/review/rw2994474/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2019,Calicodreamin,4," These people are complete idiots
","I can't in good conscience give this movie a good rating based solely on the complete idiocy of the characters. Their sole purpose is to swim 10 miles to an island after their boat sinks, so tell me why they spend the majority of the time treading water?! Keep moving! Then as soon as they see the shark they huddle up and thrash about, which about only thing literally everyone knows about sharks is that they're attracted to movements! Then at the climactic moment of the movie, Katie cant get her act together to get Luke on the island, with minutes to work with. Then proceeds to scream wildly into the air - you could have saved him! I cannot with these idiots, ruined the movie.",/review/rw2994474/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2019,caelum-natura,8," Heavy movie
","Reef is good shark movie. It feels real, raw... It is scary but also sad movie knowing it is based on real events. Group of people wanted to have fun, but mother nature sent a hunter.",/review/rw2994474/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2011,Jaymb72,9," It scared me something rotten
","Yes, The Reef is similar to Open Water but ramps up the scare factor by giving us the mother of all sharks, the Great White. The way in which the movie puts you amongst the actors is really well done. You feel like you are there with them. When the camera dips under the surface of the water with the bobbing motion of the waves you get little glimpses of what lies beneath. The tension is unbearable at times and I felt sick with fear. It's the anticipation of the oncoming attack that had me wriggling in my seat. Believe me, when the first attack comes you will bang your head off the ceiling in fright.",/review/rw2994474/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2011,cosmo_tiger,," An entertaining movie that should have been called ""Open Water Again"". Good movie, but as close to a remake you can get. I say B
","""Your more likely to die from a bee sting then get killed be a shark."" After the boat that they are on gets damaged and is unable to move, five friends must decide to wait it out on the boat or swim to an island. When the decision is made they soon begin to regret their choice. First of all I will say that I did enjoy the movie. I have not yet seen the movie ""Open Water"", but after watching this I feel like I have. This movie is repetitive but keeps you watching. People swim, they see a shark...over and over. Like ""Open Water"" this is a true story, which helps in the enjoyment of this. There really isn't much more to say about this movie, not too much to it, but it is entertaining. Overall, I liked it, but if you have seen ""Open Water"" this may be too much of the same thing to fully enjoy it. I give it a B.",/review/rw2994474/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2019,snagssharkteeth-23785,10," Excellent film
","This film is not your classic Jaws or deep blue sea film because its not fiction. Those films are classic Hollywood jargon. I quickly realized this was an Australian film because of the uncouth accents. I am Tasmanian but during this film I began to think it was not your average shark horror film, a film that involves waters that are invested with intelligent sharks calculating their victims base patterns. I do not enjoy the suffering of other people, even it is vicariously displayed through out a film but I did enjoy this film from a realistic pint of view.
It was sad, it was disheartening but I could not expect anything less.
Its a good film and can definitely be a film to learn from and I am glad it is a film htat does not defame sharks.",/review/rw2994474/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2017,thelastblogontheleft,5," Good Suspense
","There's not much more to say about the plot besides that quick synopsis. Luke (played by Damian Walshe-Howling) is delivering a yacht to a customer and brings a few friends (and a fellow sailor) along with him for a fun trip. Not long after they start on their journey, they hit part of the reef and must decide whether they will stay with the slowly capsizing boat or try to swim to the nearest land. The sailor stays behind as the other four make their way out into open water, and get picked off one by one by a great white shark.",/review/rw2994474/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2021,leesimon-26357,8," Harrowing and tense. A very realistic depiction
","Probably the shark movie with the most realistic depiction of animal behavior. This is not your action-packed, stalker-shark kind of a movie. It is the very real-seeming events that unfold after 5 normal people are in a boat that capsizes. It was absolutely chilling and gut-wrenching. I wouldn't see it again, because a slow-burn towards an inevitable terrible fate is not my kind of thrills, but I highly recommend that others see it. it is worth seeing at least once, and if you are the kind of person for whom the dread of impending doom is fun, then this is your jam!",/review/rw2994474/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2010,gregsrants,7," Better than Open Water
","One cannot write a review about The Reef without referencing 2003's  Open Water. After all, the plot details are practically identical. Both  films center upon people that are stranded in the ocean and fight off  hungry sharks while swimming aimlessly in hopes of survival. And in  both films, the sharks win. The main difference in The Reef is the  number of characters involved (four this time instead of two) and how  they end up in their predicament (their boat capsizes as opposed to  simply being forgotten).  The Reef begins with the requisite introduction of the main characters.  Their names don't matter so let's simplify by identifying there is a  couple, a former couple and a sailor. The group of five take to the  ocean from Sydney, Australia for a day of underwater snorkeling. But  upon their return, their vessel hits a hidden rock and tears a hole in  the ship's hull. The boat flips and soon the five mates are sitting on  the underbelly of their capsized and sinking ship.  With an outdated rescue beacon, four members of the group decide to  take to the water in hopes they can swim to land which they approximate  to be 10-12 miles north of their location. To the water they take, but  before long their positive spirit is met with terrifying reality when a  shark begins to circle the swimming foursome. Panic turns to frightful  horror when the shark attacks and eats one of the water treading  swimmers. As the horror of their situation becomes a deadly reality,  the remaining three try to make it to land before the ever-hungry shark  comes back for seconds and thirds.  Open Water was a bit of a independent success back in 2003. Marketed as  being based on true events, two actors portrayed the doomed simmers  while reportedly being circled by real sharks. The Reef would also have  you believe that their story is authentic and the result is no less  terrifying.  Sharks continue to be one of the most feared animals on the planet  (thanks Steven Spielberg!) and writer/director Andrew Traucki uses the  ocean and his circling beast to his utmost advantage. A scene where the  shark literally glides over one of the swimmers shoulders was both  terrifying and masterfully crafted.  Aforementioned, references to Open Water are unavoidable, but The Reef  is actually a better film due largely to the larger cast (more people =  more carnage) and that the dialogue didn't solely consist of a couple  arguing and yelling to each other between shark feeding times.  You don't really get attached to any one character to emotionally hope  for any one particular survivor to the tragic event, but The Reef still  provides audiences with what is advertised on the DVD packaging.  It may not equal Jaws for overall entertainment value, but we don't  think it was attempting to unseat the champ either.",/review/rw2994474/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2010,Jonny_Yahoo,10," I'm getting back out of the water!!!
","Honestly, I wasn't expecting much at all when I sat down to watch ""The Reef"" at what I like to call ""Ye Olde Online Movie Theater."" I figured there'd be a few unintentional laughs, quite a bit of gore and bad cgi plus, hopefully, a few fair maidens to ogle as I drifted off to sleep.",/review/rw2994474/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2011,Chase_Witherspoon,8," The Ray Boundy & Danny Thorpe homage
","Intense dramatisation of real-life events finds a quintet stranded atop their capsized yacht having to make the impossible decision to either remain with the sinking vessel, or swim the twelve miles to a rocky outcrop so distant, it's not even visible. Four of the stricken sailors elect to swim, one remains behind on the upended wreck. The presence of a large, mutilated sea turtle leads the quartet to suspect they may not be the only carnivores in the vicinity. What happens thereafter is, while predictable, still suspenseful and frightening to contemplate.",/review/rw2994474/?ref_=tt_urv

","Three blokes and two sheilas go out to do some snorkeling. Bad thing happens and now they have to make a choice to either swim for land and risk the chance of being shark bait, or wait for safety and risk death by more boring odds. Of course you swim!

27 May 2012,kosmasp,6," It's not Open Water
","As another reviewer stated, this is better than that. So to compare it, would feel like an insult (at least it does to me). Were ""Open Water"" bored you to death, this is actually suspenseful. I'm not a big fan of the general idea (wasn't since Open Water brought this up), but the execution here and the actors involved, make this more than a worthwhile watching experience.",/review/rw2994474/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2014,philipposathina,10," Sorry to put it so straight forward, but It really scared the sh.. out of me!!!
","Perhaps the most scary movie ever!!! Focused on the desperation and panic of its characters rather than any spectacular blood shedding scenes (they are there too, but only as many as the story demands), the audience does inevitably participate to the drama, identifies himself with its characters and consequently experiences through them a horrifying nightmare!!!... The film is full of sheer terror, from the beginning to the end, dumb or active, yet, in any case, almost unbearable! It has achieved the perfect proportion of an imminent, constant yet unseen therefore invincible, almost paranormal threat and of an ultimate anguish and desperation, to such an unprecedented extend that you will probably feel like closing eyes and ears to distant yourself from it, no matter how much a fan of horror you're! Most certainly another great Australian film! Awesome! realistic, true and frightening much much more than anything you have ever seen on screen so far, it makes all American ""super"" productions of this genre look more hilarious than Mary Poppins! A must for great - extreme to be more precise- excitement fans!!!",/review/rw2994474/?ref_=tt_urv
