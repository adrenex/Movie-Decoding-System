","Let me start off by saying that I was introduced to the films of Terrence Malick in 1998 when I watched and was blown away by 'The Thin Red Line.' It is one of the best war movies ever made and while I can rant about it at length, that review belongs on a different page. It was with great anticipation that I waited for 'The New World.' I was lucky enough to get tickets to an advance screening and the theatre was full of people like me. Their take on the film was almost as interesting as the film was.",/review/rw1864325/?ref_=tt_urv

","During the 1970s Terrence Malick directed one excellent film, ""Badlands"", and one masterpiece, ""Days of Heaven"". After that he seemed to exile himself from the cinema for a long period, and it was twenty years before his third film, ""The Thin Red Line"", appeared. There then followed another period of silence, this time for seven years, before ""The New World"" came out in 2005.",/review/rw1864325/?ref_=tt_urv

","Malick's method is to frame films as remembrances. Remembrances of romantic notions, whether freedom, peace, war or love (as his four films trace). This way, he can exploit a languorous floating through remembered reality that never is that gentle or considered in actual reality. He can use his narration as things remembered, floating over the sights. To make this as effective as possible, he plays all sorts of tricks with the sound, having different boundaries of different types between what you see and hear.",/review/rw1864325/?ref_=tt_urv

","A quite-literally breathtaking 120 minute montage of sights and sounds evoking the first British contact with North America. The narrative is minimal, even inconsequential, as perhaps it should be in a story that is predominantly about the human need to communicate even when language is a barrier rather than a vehicle to understanding. The performances are universally outstanding, the cinematography and editing award worthy, and the use of 'Das Rheingold' the most inspired use of Wagner ever in a movie. 'The New World' is a genuinely poetic, lyrical, visually stunning and heartbreaking movie. About as flawless as cinema gets. For those still unsure of my feelings, I loved this movie.",/review/rw1864325/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2006,kaessner,10," Poignant and transcendental
","First, let me applaud this film. I have been waiting for Terrence Malick's fourth film ever since I saw The Thin Red Line. Arguably, Malick is one of the most adept and deliberate filmmakers right now. The New World is nearly flawless, and the beauty of Malick's direction adds to the argument that film can still be considered aesthetic. Much has been lost in the last 30 years, but Terrence Malick sticks to what he knows. What some people may complain about this movie are the long silences, the action-less movement, and the poetic voice over. This is what Malick does. He is a modern transcendentalist. What he does with film is comparable to what Emerson did in writing. The color is naturalistic, and the sounds are earthly. It helps that Malick uses natural light for his shots, giving the scenery more life and texture. As for the substance of the film, what isn't pantomimed in subtle gestures and movements is brought to life with flowing poetic voice over. This goes all the way back to Badlands for Malick. But here, we get varying minds contributing. There are some moments in this film when the viewer has to understand the characters by their facial expressions instead of their words. I think that will be hard for a lot of people who are expecting a more vocative and kinetic film. As for the acting, I was very impressed with all involved, particularly Q'Orianka Kilcher. This young woman played the part of innocence beautifully. I also have to give some credit to Colin Farrell, considering I never expect much out of him. Unlike some of his other movies, he was not in it to steal the spotlight. Everyone played their parts without any excessive over-acting. This movie is a historical drama, but I feel like the history aspect is merely a backdrop for the Terrence Malick play. In his production, the flowing waters and the forest canopy are the actors, and the gentle reflections of troubled minds are the words. Truly, this is an incredible film. I have waited a long time for Terrence Malick to wow me again, and he has done exactly that. If you want a movie that tears at your heart strings, then go see something recycled like Brokeback Mountain. If you want a transcendental experience, one that challenges you to go deeper than the surface of the film, then The New World is waiting.",/review/rw1864325/?ref_=tt_urv

26 February 2006,marika_alexandrou,10," A feast for the senses
","I finally saw ""The New World"" yesterday. It was quite an experience.This film is miles away from any other that I've ever seen before. It's a feast for the senses. Senses are the key to this movie. You either let them guide you or you've missed the whole point. I cannot blame anyone who has complained about how slow, boring or even irritating this picture was. This is not the kind of movie that can be appreciated by intelligent reading. Neither does it belong to the category of highbrow artistic films that aim to an intellectual elite of an audience and shut out the rest of us, poor lesser mortals. You don't have to ""understand"" this film, you have to ""feel"" it. Just open up your heart and let the emotions carry you away and elevate you. The plot is simple and far from original. Adam and Eve, paradise lost, human greed and personal ambition coming face to face with the beauty of nature and the joy of pure living. Clash between illusion and reality, dream and fact. The originality of this film lies in the way that these themes are depicted. Muted glances, forbidden touches, light and darkness mingle with the murmur of the river and the rustle of the wind  the breath of mother nature. Dialogs are scarce. Mainly voice overs run through the whole picture. I found them neither irritating nor useless. They are uttered in the form of inner thoughts, secret longings, muted prayers and they add to the dreamlike effect of this movie. Acting was actually very good. That was an extra bonus for a film like this, where actors are meant more to help the story and the images unfold, than astound us with their memorable performances. The actors' success in this movie lies in their ability to express their feelings through minor gestures, glances and body language. Q'Orianka Kilcher is a magnificent creature that embodies the essence of nature and beauty. She bends, she submits to the inevitability of assimilation but she never loses her freedom of spirit. Farrell's sad eyes speak volumes of emotion that could never be expressed in spoken words and Bale's kind-hearted demeanor is just perfect. ""The New World"" is like a poem. What I got out of it was a bitter-sweet taste in my mouth, a swirl of images and sounds in my mind and a wealth of emotion in my heart",/review/rw1864325/?ref_=tt_urv

","Film-snobs of the worst kind, desperately grasping at straws in this ""style over substance"" piece of turd. That may seem harsh, but considering the ridiculous praise Terence Malick has gotten for his supposedly 'outstanding cinematography' on The New World, I don't feel like holding back any criticism.

","Let me first say that I am a big fan of historical epics. As a matter of fact I joyfully sat through all 6+ hours of Bertolucci's ""1900"" in one sitting at a revival house; in short, I am not some dolt who wandered in because ""Underworld 2"" was sold out.",/review/rw1864325/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2006,thetempletterror,10," Quite simply, sensational.
","This was incredible. I'm living at the moment in the awful urban sprawl of Dublin , Ireland and took myself right into the inner city to see this and, to my surprise, found myself being transported not only to another land but also to another time. When I came out, I was in a trance for the rest of the day, pining for a land and society that is no more and dreaming sweet dreams of angelic Pocahontas, gentle John Rolfe and ruggedly genuine John Smith. All three of course excellently played by Q'uiranka (is that right), Christian and even Colin who, though the accent may have been shaky, captured perfectly what it would have been to be in John Smith's situation. Mallick, of course, is a genius and when his films are this good they're well worth the decade or so of waiting. Also, I don't know who the director of photography was but what a job they did, possibly the most beautiful film ever put on screen. All in all, a masterpiece which I'll carry with me every step I take in this ofttimes sorry world.",/review/rw1864325/?ref_=tt_urv

10 December 2005,don_agu,8," Something Old, Something New
","A breathtaking landscape populated by looks of discovery. Very few words, just the sensation that something is changing. Terrence Malick is one of my heroes but I had the feeling that, this time, he was expecting too much from me. Within the lushness of the surroundings there is something static, unapproachable, inaccessible. Q'Orianks Kilcher as Pocahontas is, quite simply, sublime but her emotions, and therefore mine, were kept so far removed that it was hard for me to get involved. Slowly, very slowly but surely her story started to creep in under my skin. I floated out of the theatre transported by the visual feast I had been served but frustrated by the numbness it provoked. A Terrence Malick film is a Terrence Malik film and you take it the way it was intended. I will, but I fear I'll be in the minority.",/review/rw1864325/?ref_=tt_urv

17 May 2011,moonspinner55,4," A masterful achievement from a technical and artistic standpoint
","Writer-director Terrence Malick's depiction of 17th century British expedition to found new colony in Jamestown, Virginia is a masterful achievement from a technical and artistic standpoint...yet, it is so low-keyed that it rarely comes to life. This is the work of a great cinematic auteur, but one exits ""The New World"" (particularly in its mammoth, 172-minute ""extended version"") feeling unmoved. As depicted, the expedition isn't heightened in excitement with bold characterizations or rousing action; the filmmaker keeps the scenario in check, preferring to let the narrative unfold carefully (some may argue too cautiously). This is an intellectual's version of a history lesson, and some viewers may be put off by the slow pace. Colin Ferrell (heavily bearded--and with alert but haunted eyes) portrays Captain John Smith, who becomes a doomed prisoner of the Natives before having his life spared by the chief's doe-eyed daughter, Pocahontas. Their love affair verges dangerously close to Blue Lagoon territory (lots of chaste, bare shoulder-rubbing and half-kisses in montage), though Malick shows a surprising vulnerability in these instances (he displays the dawning of new and tremulous emotions with a kind of naked purity). The mutiny which ensues between the British and the ""savages"" is brutal and hard-hitting; however, the human drama at the heart of the picture seems stretched out too long. Malick doesn't tiptoe through the tangled relationships, but his focus does tend to stray. Christian Bale's role as smitten new settler John Rolfe is flattened as a result; he never takes on any dimension. Rolfe is an unenviable romantic substitute for an absentee Smith, and when he and Pocahontas go through the whole courting thing all over again, it just feels like a repeat. As an artistic and visceral achievement, ""The New World"" is vivid, brooding and intense. As an entertainment, per se, it lacks an inner fire that is necessary to envelop a wide audience. Malick isn't indifferent to the people on-screen, but one gets the impression he's far more interested in the erotic, swirling waters, the crackling lightning in the cloudy skies, and the forms and figures of the muscular Native Americans as seen in silhouette or by firelight. Do the central characters become important and real to us? Not very. ** from ****",/review/rw1864325/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2008,PWNYCNY,5," Long boring movie.
","This movie was nominated for an Academy Award? For what? For best movie for producing boredom? What a long ... drawn out ... ponderous ... pretentious ... piece of Hollywood pseudodocudrama. (Yawn) Oh, watching Captain Smith and Pocahontas doing touchy-feely while the whites and Indians are literally preparing to kill each other was extraordinarily underwhelming. The arrival of the English in 1607 was an important moment in history but as usual Hollywood reduces it to a mere historical backdrop for an improbable and ludicrous love story between a little Indian girl and bedraggled discredited Englishman who, with the rest of his group, were unwelcome guests on someone else's turf. What this movie fails to answer is: Why did this little girl love John Smith? According to the movie, Captain Smith had no leadership skills, was universally disliked, was a failure as a soldier and inspired scorn from amongst his peers. The actress who plays Pocahantas is cute but her acting skills need further development. She simply is not convincing in the role nor did she look the part. If you like long boring movies then this movie is for you.",/review/rw1864325/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is probably the most boring movie I have ever seen since A Space Odyssey. I almost fell asleep during the film. The story wasn't carried by the actors; it was shown by pretty images of water and landscapes. I felt like I was looking at a screen full of pretty pictures of nature with the stereo turned up.

6 May 2006,tfrizzell,," Discovering More of the Globe.
","John Smith (Colin Farrell) lands in the titled location of present-day North America in the late-17th century. Strains come from the natives immediately (led by chieftain August Schellenberg and warrior Wes Studi) as their balance of nature and peaceful surroundings is threatened. Pocahontas (a smashingly amazing starring debut by youngster Q'Orianka Kilcher) ends up being the liaison between her people and the British newcomers. A deep ethereal love blossoms between Farrell and Kilcher, but time and circumstance will not allow it to be. The focus shifts as more newcomers come and a young John Rolfe (dynamite role for Christian Bale) falls for the hypnotic Kilcher and marriage follows. Kilcher does not only win over the British in her land, but in theirs as well as historical fascinations bring her over as both a curiosity and also an early diplomat for connections between old time lands and new ones. Carrying a heavy burden not only historically but also cinematically, Kilcher's role becomes the thing legends are made of. ""The New World"" is simply out of this world all the way. The eclectic and highly enigmatic Terrence Malick (writer/director) appeared lost forever to the cinematic world after his triumphant ""Days of Heaven"" in 1978. He popped up again 20 years later with ""The Thin Red Line"" (the very best film of the 1990s). The rumor mill made it appear that he may not be heard from again. Thankfully he was some seven years later in 2005. Malick's production is everything you would expect from arguably the finest American filmmaker alive (the most interesting and fascinating anyway). Poetic undertones and the deep philosophical questioning of life and our place in this world mix with top-notch cinematography, a hauntingly beautiful score and wonderful set pieces. Farrell, made out to be the top-billed star, disappears about half-way through and the focus shifts to Bale and Kilcher. The three are on cinematic highs rarely reached and the supporting performers (most notably Christopher Plummer, Jonathan Pryce and Alexandra W.B. Malick in basically cameo roles) are well-placed players in Malick's operatic ode to this sometimes unbelievably beautiful and complex part of early North American/world history. Way too smart for most audiences and much too methodical and strategic for shallow cinematic viewers, ""The New World"" proudly sits next to Malick's other three masterpieces as one of the very best pictures ever conceived. 5 stars out of 5.",/review/rw1864325/?ref_=tt_urv
