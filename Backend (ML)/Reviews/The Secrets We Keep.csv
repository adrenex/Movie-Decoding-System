27 January 2003,guido anselmi,9," Score one for the dreamers
","Waking Life is among a handful of films (Woyzeck, Magnolia, The Passion of Anna) that really frustrate me, because as much as I love them I can't necessarily recommend them to everyone. There are certain films for which one needs to be on a certain wavelength to enjoy, no matter how cultured or intelligent. This film is best for those who have sat around thinking about the big questions in life for long periods of time, dying for someone to talk to about them. I guess Waking Life isn't about those questions so much as it's about the people who are asking them, the wonderers, the thinkers, and especially the dreamers. For those who can appreciate it, it's a cleansing experience, one of a purity and beauty that has no equal in the films I've been fortunate enough to see.",/review/rw7724718/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2003,Spamlet,10," A film for passionate thinkers.
",This is one of the most thought provoking films I've ever seen. It's also visually stunning and perfectly acted: every single one of these people seem to be just giving their own opinions as if you were overhearing/having a meaningful conversation with them. ,/review/rw7724718/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2002,Nick_Dets,," Wonderful
","Waking Life is an amazing, visual, and completely original work of art from filmmaker Richard Linklater. It is not only one of the very best films to be released in 2001, but also one of the most thought provoking films I've ever seen.  Watching it is an amazing experience in itself. 	Its visual style is stunning.  Digital animation is put over live action actors in a style that every scene is like some kind of a post-modern painting that you would see in an art gallery. 	The story follows a young man by the name of Wiley Wiggins and his encounters with many interesting people.  He listens to their thoughts and theories, but doesn't really understand why.  He is in an on-going lucid dream that takes him to odd, but fascinating encounters with people and places. 	I absolutely loved this film.  It is one of those rare films that takes you away from your seat and into a world that you are placed right in the middle of and when it ends, the only thing you can say is, `Wow!'",/review/rw7724718/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2002,saturdaze,," Beautiful sloppiness; an excellent mistake
","Imagine a man who shows up for a job interview wearing a torn T-shirt, sneakers, and sunglasses. The manager interviewing him can't believe that someone would have the audacity to show up like this but he can't help being impressed by this guy's intelligence, charm, sensitivity, and work-ethic...skills which every employer desires in a potential employee. Well, ""Waking Life"" is like that smart but sloppy man showing up for the job interview, and the employer is us, the audience.",/review/rw7724718/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2006,Quinoa1984,10," it's fractured and a little 'all-over-the-place', but it's alive and it gets the sparks in your head going in ways few movies can
","Waking Life is almost like a compilation of short films as opposed to one complete full length feature. But then the film insists repeatedly that there is a logic to it, dream logic. This, however, could even be circumspect. It's really a unique blend of philosophical monologue &/or soliloquy &/or dialogs, a mix of 'isms' (asburdism, surrealism chiefly, even magical realism in tiny spots), and if there were any film of the past ten years that I might offer up as a recommendation to Godard, it might be this. Richard Linklater also serves up his kind of sequel to his first film, Slacker, which was about as free-form and experimental and questioning and thinking about the ways of life as any given group of college kids (the bright ones I mean) might have on a bright day. It's ironic though after seeing the film to think that this is even considered a 'stoner movie'. The color scheme, developed by Bob Sabiston (who would also head A Scanner Darkly, another Linklater film), is about as wild and perfunctory for the kind of mood that Linklater could get. Wily Wiggins, after getting hit by a car, drifts in and out of dreams- constantly dreaming one could only possibly think to guess- as people come forward in Austin Texas to put forward views on life. But will this state of constant dreaming (sometimes 'lucid' sometimes not) continue? ",/review/rw7724718/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2003,RJGodin2,8," very good, creative, expansion of Slackers
","It is rare for a director to return to a film and improve it but Linklater does it here. Taking the general form of Slackers, he adds a metaphysical story line and coats it with extraordinary eye candy. ",/review/rw7724718/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2008,bob the moo,," Visually and content-wise interesting if not totally successful or as smart or insightful as it wanted to be
","I watched Waking Life more for the visual appeal because I wanted to see Linklater's use of rotoscoping before he did it to mixed effect in A Scanner Darkly. With this in mind I did not have a clue what the film was about and for some reason I thought it would be some sort of New York set Slackers comedy with a lot of narrative drift  I have no idea where I got this idea from but it was at least accurate in regards the ""narrative drift"". To describe the basic plot it is enough to say that the main character spends the film in a sort of dream state in which he meets/sees all manner of people who discuss ideas, theories and philosophy of life  and that's more or less it.",/review/rw7724718/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2007,lhhung_himself,1," Vapid attempt at intellectualism
","Waking Life is like the US Today of philosophy - full of headlines, catchphrases and short self-important articles that communicate nothing. Even something very talky like ""My Night at Maude's"" at least tries to spend enough time to explore the philosophical question.",/review/rw7724718/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2001,kolangandedg,," Waking Life: philosophical therapy.
","This film, if seen by someone who has DEEPLY considered the mysteries of life, will thoroughly delight. If you don't have a spiritual bone in your body, avoid. It has its flaws, but only in retrospect or through the eyes of another will they be found--and then forgiven if you have even an ounce of heart or a particle of transcendence.",/review/rw7724718/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2002,StellaLuna11,10," Fantastic Work of Film Art
","Waking Life has broken new ground surrounding the idea of animation. Filming people, then having artists with different styles ""animate"" the recorded scenes was brilliant. The visuals are constantly changing, providing an aurora of sights that you can not take your eyes off of. Trippy? Yes, Burnt Out? No- This movie can not only be appreciated for the wild images, but for the story-line as well... On second thought-story-line might not be the right word. The actual ""plot"" of this movie can be seen as an hour and a half of the most interesting philosophy course one can find. The characters and conversations are deep, fascinating, and thought-provoking. You must see this movie more than once because it is almost impossible to absorb what you see and be able to fully appreciate the genius of the script.  I've seen it about 5 times and there are still some scenes I have yet to fully grasp. Sit back and treat your eyes and mind to the most stimulating film of the year.",/review/rw7724718/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2001,Jeff-197,1," pretentious garbage
","Let me begin by saying that reviewing this movie puts you into a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario.  If you think it sucked, well, you're just too stupid to understand it, or you don't have the attention span. ""Why don't you just go see Monster's Inc."", they'll rebut.  So you are forced to say that you like it.  I'd be willing to bet that at least 50% of those saying it is great (with no specificity) are just trying to avoid looking like they can't understand it.",/review/rw7724718/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2004,garvey802000,," Linklater brings us deeper.....
",I recently viewed Waking Life By Richard Linklater and found it to be a truly unique viewing experience. The film deals with the idea of lucid dreams and the nature of our existence and many other philosophical questions. What struck me about the film was the way in which the superb animation was layered over the film. What this achieves is indeed a sense of a dreamlike viewing experience.Everyone has those dreams where they have a great sense of having gone somewhere and done something wonderful when they wake up. It may be difficult to remember details of your surroundings or what exactly you did but you know you were somewhere doing something. The jumpy nature and fluid characteristics of the animation really help to create that very same feeling while viewing the film.,/review/rw7724718/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2004,superfragglerock,10," How could anyone not enjoy this movie?
","Okay, i haven't read any comments yet, but a lot of the ""one line summaries"" sound negative. I just finished watching this film, and registered an account with IMDb solely to speak of this film. These are the types of movies that we should be expecting from filmmakers today. Aren't we all tired of the blockbuster bullshit by now? True, it's not a ""typical movie"" and yes...it is a cartoon. But, the style is completely unique and entirely necessary for the story. If it were simply caught on film and released in that same manor, it would not have had the monstrous effect that it had, and it would not have come across in a way that would retain the interest of this generation's ADD youth (which SHOULD be it's primary demographic...they are the ones who can still change this world, and create the paradigm shift that is necessary) This movie is the fiber of all life, it IS that collective unconscious from which we all draw our own, personal beings. It explains the philosophies of years gone by and minutes gone by in a way that anyone could understand them. While I know that some closed minded people are going to be scared and confused by all of this necessary information, if only one mind is opened because of it, I know that Richard Linklater would be greatly pleased.",/review/rw7724718/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2007,Superunknovvn,8," Dreamy movie
","""Waking Life"" is a dreamy movie by definition. It reminded me a bit of Jim Jarmusch' ""Night On Earth"" - maybe because those movies have similar (yet fantastic) scores, maybe it's because both are told in episodes with little else going on than people talking to each other. ""Waking Life"" is really unlike any other movie, though.",/review/rw7724718/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2009,MOscarbradley,2," Pretentious twaddle
","A technically adventurous and hugely pretentious piece of animation from Richard Linklater. It has no real 'plot' but is rather like a series of ideas without a structure to sustain them. To call it different isn't, in this case, a compliment and while the visuals are remarkable they are often remarkably annoying - the wavy animation might induce a feeling of sea-sickness.",/review/rw7724718/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2004,la_jane16,," random beauty of the subconscious
","Waking Life is probably one of the most randomly amazing works that I have seen. It's lack of a plot, random events, and constant motion give it the dreamlike feel. The ideas are all so intriguing that I don't understand how anyone can hate this movie. I can understand that it could be hard to sit through if you're tired, or if you refuse to contemplate the endless possibilities presented. I'll also admit that some people would find it very hard to watch the animation, but to me it keeps your attention. I tried to imagine what this movie would have been like if it hadn't been animated and I don't think it would have had the impact on as many people as it has if it weren't for the animation. I think that anyone who enjoys the topic of dreams would find it worthwhile. I could watch this movie over and over and still find something that I hadn't noticed before. If you don't like movies that make you think, don't watch it. But if you want a movie that gives you a lot of things to think about and allows you the freedom to interpret it in many different ways . . . check it out!",/review/rw7724718/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2003,oddi-3,10," A mind expanding experience.
","I greatly enjoyed Waking Life, I was most impressed by the animation and the philosophical dialog that just kept hanging on the characters' every word. This movie is not for everyone, at least not for those who like their films 'light'. The fact is that Waking Life consists mostly of the main character discussing philosophical topics with various colorful characters. At some point it was difficult to remain concentrated to everything the characters say, for they were rambling quite discoursively, making the audience feel like they're attending a lecture. But the animation makes up for that, because the film has so much visual content that one could also watch it with out the dialog, just being immersed in the art.",/review/rw7724718/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2010,fubared1,2," Full of sound and fury...
","Actually the 2nd have of that quote would be more appropriate to this so-called film. A lot of 2-penny philosophy, in other words, pedantic nonsense, spoken by 'actors' who obviously haven't got a clue about what they are saying, like a sci-fi movie where characters speak in meaningless technobabble. It certainly isn't great or even interesting philosophy. Frame it all in some highly unimaginative rotoscoping passing as 'animation' and you'll have the end result presented here. A total waste of film. Honestly, why anyone thinks Linklater is a director or writer is beyond me. And yes, I have seen his other films and frankly, I don't think the guy has a clue about how to make films. It's like he's trying to be the next Godard...and failing miserably.",/review/rw7724718/?ref_=tt_urv

13 April 2003,fehrsp,1," ""Talking About"" Scenes
","My screenwriting prof., Thomas Pope (author of Good Scripts, Bad Scripts), always talked about the danger of ""talk about"" scenes.  ""Talk about"" scenes are scenes in which characters ""talk about"" something without doing anything.  Film is a medium that combines sound and moving imagery and it is wasted in ""talk about"" scenes.  Tom's theory was that you should always show your audience instead of ""talking about"" what you want to show them.",/review/rw7724718/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2006,claudio_carvalho,4," Original, But Overrated, Pretentious and Extremely Boring
","I was very curious to watch ""Waking Life"" and I expected a great movie. I was wrong! There are positive aspects, practically the originality and the adopted technique in the animation. Unfortunately, the shallow plot is simply awful, based on philosophy of readers of cartoons and pseudo-intellectuals. The wavy animations and the tedious story make the eyes very tired, and I slept many times along this 101 minutes running time, a nightmare with dreams. I do not recall how many times I had to press the rewind button to see the scene again. By the quantity of persons related in the cast, I believe that director and writer Richard Linklater is very well connected with people of the cinema industry that probably helped him promoting this overrated, pretentious and extremely boring film.

","God did I hate this movie!  It's an animated one, but done in a way so everything is constantly jiggling and off center--I think it was done to keep the viewer off balance--it just made me want to throw up (I had to keep closing my eyes).  There's no real plot--just some guy walking (or floating) around and listening to various people talk about dreams and reality again and again and again etc etc etc.  I have no problem with a movie that's all talk (I think ""Before Sunrise"", for example, is a great movie) but all the dialogue here is stupid and incomprehensible.  What these people are saying makes no sense!  More than once I was thinking ""what the f***"" after a few really stupid lines.  After an hour I was bored, annoyed and disgusted and I walked out (I NEVER walk out of movies).  A total piece of overindulgent crap.  Avoid at all costs.",/review/rw7724718/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2022,madahab,8," The iguana bites those who do not dream
","There are only a handful of films that have evoked a WOW!! Reaction out of me and Waking Life is on that short list. It is a stunning experience for both the eyes and mind. Apart from two scenes it is a very positive film, which makes those two scenes out of place. The rotoscoped animation varies from sequence to sequence and some might find it (especially if they have issues with motion sickness) a little uneasy to watch. I was more absorbed in the topics of conversation and ideas that are rich throughout the film. Some may find the lack of a linear story or any sort of resolution a little frustrating but I think it would have diminished the film greatly if anything was explained. It is only tainted by the appearance of Alex Jones, yep, that Alex Jones. At the time of seeing in 2001 I had no idea who he was. Years later I was watching it and now the voice was very familiar. I read the credits and confirmed that it was him. This is my favourite sequence. In it he plays a variation of the ""character"" we've come to know on his show but here there is hopeful nature to his rantings. Despite this Waking Life is still a film that ignites my imagination. On the d DVD copy it has a feature which text appears on the screen when they characters are talking about a book or specific philosopher. I hope the Criterion Collection releases a blu-ray version.",/review/rw7724718/?ref_=tt_urv
