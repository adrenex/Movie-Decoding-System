4 October 2021,Supermanfan-13,8," Pretty Entertaining!
",I didn't really know what to expect from Carnival Row but I gotta say that I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. You can tell they spent a lot of money on this as the world they put together is really impressive! For any fans of fantasy this is a must watch and even if you're not into fantasy that much it's still a good watch!,/review/rw5088438/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Entertaining!
","Carnival Row was definitely a lot better than I was expecting. It takes place in a world where different mythological creatures all exist and live together though most don't get along. They also coexist to live with humans after humans invaded their homelands to take over. It follows a human detective named Rycraft ""Philo"" Philostrate (Orlando Bloom) and a refuge faerie named Vignette Stonemoss (Cara Delevingne) as they rekindle a dangerous affair among a society that doesn't not tolerate humans and creatures getting together. Philo investigates a series of dangerous murders while Vignette has a secret that endangers then both. I'm looking forward to the second and final season coming out in February.",/review/rw5088438/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2019,dpoland-76589,10," Watch it. Ignore comments about politics...
","I hope they make a season 2. Thoroughly enjoyable fantasy with good amount of realism. Anyone trying to pin this as overtly political ignores that the themes in the show are common in history, not surprising to find in entertainment in general and not ""propaganda.""
Great acting and great visuals! Enjoy and leave politics at the door, just for a minute...",/review/rw5088438/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2019,robfollower,8," Not everything works in the show. But when it does, it takes flight.
","The Amazon series is easier to follow even as it introduces initially-unconnected characters in multiple social classes. This gives ""Carnival Row"" plenty of areas to explore.
It seems the time is right for audiences to become invested in this magical world, even if it's a far darker and nastier place than they might have otherwise imagined.",/review/rw5088438/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2019,lazerlash,8," Probably the most immersive steampunk fantasy on the screen.
","I don't know what the professional critics had against this series. The production values are fabulous, the world building is impressive, the acting is decent, the story is interesting.",/review/rw5088438/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2021,northernpaladin,8," Splendid
","This was absolutely splendid. I had no expectations when I started watching it and knew nothing about it, thinking it would be Ripper Street with a touch of fantasy. First couple of episodes I was still thinking that but soon after I was utterly hooked by the believable world building and strong acting from the leads especially Orlando Bloom who shakes free of the last remaining vestiges of Legolas and gives a commanding tragic performance. The Victorian steam punk vibe is excellently bought to life and the underlying story of a displaced people struggling against prejudice and violence in a dark and hostile capital is superbly done. Clearly there are metaphors in this depiction for our own times but they are not so heavy handed as to distract from the main murder investigation that has reflections of the Ripper hunt. The answer to the murder mystery is apparent to the audience some way before the actual denouement and if there is a criticism it would be the stretch on credulity that gets us to the end in a rather hurried and over played final episode. A minor criticism though in gem of a show and I hope we will see more.",/review/rw5088438/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2019,Tweekums,9," A fantasy grounded in reality
","This series is set in another world; as well as humans there are Faeries (faes), Fauns (pucks) and other fantasy creatures. The action is mostly set in a country known as The Burgue; it has a Dickensian look but there is also an element of steampunk.",/review/rw5088438/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2019,ghanima_atrieadies,8," Very Well Done

A little of something for everyone.

30 August 2019,The_Un-Woke,9," If the 'fantasy' genre is your thing...
","... then look no further than Carnival Row. With stunning sets and highly detailed makeup/prosthetics, this latest offering from Amazon Prime is the type of high quality show that will generate new subscribers and steer them towards the streaming service. This eight part feast for the eyes kept me interested throughout, and while it occasionally slowed down in the middle episodes it never felt padded out. Each episode felt like a cinematic experience thanks to the visuals and wide screen ratio.",/review/rw5088438/?ref_=tt_urv

10 May 2021,kevin_robbins,8," I'd recommend this if you're looking for a new series to watch
","The Mrs. And I recently finished watching Carnival Row (2019) on Amazon Prime. The storyline focuses on a world with humans, fairies , minotaurs and other mythical creatures trying to all
Coexist. A civil war between species feels like it's about to breakout when a monster on the streets starts racking up a body count. The series was created by Travis Beachem (Pacific Rim & Clash of the Titans) and Rene Echevarria (The 4400 and Dark Angel) and stars Orlando Bloom (Lords of the Rings), Cara Delevingne (Suicide Squad), Tamzi Merchant (The Tudors), David Gyasi (Cloud Atlas) and Jared Harris (Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows). This is another HP Lovecraft adapted story that is a bit of a mix of Legend (my favorite Tom Cruise movie) and Game of Thrones. It's a fairytale format with different species, families and cultures that intertwines murderous monsters, beasts with great fight scenes and a who done it primary plot. This is more of a fantasy thriller than horror, but those two things sound like cousins to me. I'd recommend this if you're looking for a new series to watch and I'd score it a solid 8/10.",/review/rw5088438/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2022,krissyw-08470,9," Truly enjoyed
",I truly enjoyed the show not just the story line but the scenes and the cast as well. It's full of fantasy and action. It will def keep you on the edge of your seat and keep you captivated. I don't listen to the critics anymore about these shows because it seems like this isn't the type of show they specialize in. I've seen quite a few shows be downed that should have been praised or given a chance. I think it's about what you like at the end of the day and I love sci-fi and fantasy so I'd def rate this in the top 10. The quality was excellent. The cast had a great vibe with each other. I loved the fairy wings.,/review/rw5088438/?ref_=tt_urv

23 March 2021,impressivesgirl-37857,8," A steampunk mixture between GoT and Pirates of the Caribbean
","Slightly slow and boring at times. I watched 3 episodes and although I was interested in what is going to happen, I was just not hooked enough. The actors are good and they have chemistry. Later I decided I really want to see that steampunky environment again so I gave it a chance and I finished it in one go. Good till the end.",/review/rw5088438/?ref_=tt_urv

2 October 2020,orgrinrt,7," If it wasn't for the first two episodes, this series would've got a 9/10 from me

31 August 2019,scot-crisp,9," A fully-realized world, and hopefully the beginning of many seasons
","If you are a fan of fantasy-drama, then stop reading this, and start watching this series. Need some reasons--where to begin? It has an important overall theme: race. The visuals and sounds are impeccable (e.g. sets, costumes, make-up, and filming locations like Prague). The performances are spot-on. Orlando Bloom gives his most mature, nuanced performance yet, and Cara Delevingne's exceptional portrayal of a fae (fairy) is alone reason to watch the series. Jared Harris raises every scene he is in, as always, and David Gyasi's is outstanding in perhaps the show's most complex role. The emotional writing creates a fully realized world. It is kind of like Pratchett's Discworld (without, unfortunately, the humor). Can't wait for Season 2.",/review/rw5088438/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2022,natalien-26054,9," Exciting!!
","Wonderful fantasy. Begging for more, waiting continuation of the series. Nothing to compare it to in the past or present. Simply outstanding. Characters are perfect and have you wantig more. Enjoy as a binge. Or slowly, but do enjoy the wonderfuly cosmic generation and location.",/review/rw5088438/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2019,laurenhuchingson,7," Watching until the end is key
","I've been looking forward to this series for so long and have been reading all of the recent negative critic feedback.
I decided to watch the first few episodes to see for myself and I hate to say it but there were large parts that are cringey, contrived, or just boring to watch. In my opinion, Jared Harris is miscast as Absalom - it didn't work for me at all. The specific comments about the lack of chemistry between Bloom and Delevigne are not over exaggerated initially.
HOWEVER...you start to see the chemistry growing eventually, especially in the later episodes. I was really feeling it between them by the end. You start to realize that Philo is a ""broken thing"" and he's shutdown to a lot of the world which explains Blooms approach. Unfortunately things get started clunky and slow and many critics only watch the first few episodes.
Outside of the two mains, there are other relationships that have easily guessed but fun storylines to watch, especially Imogen and Agreus.
By episode 6 (which is definitely very late in the season) it felt like a lot of things were starting to click.
GIVE THE SHOW A TRY! It's not the ""new GOT"" but it's a fun watch for what it is.",/review/rw5088438/?ref_=tt_urv

15 December 2019,nancyldraper,9," Better received on a second look
","Initially, I abandoned the series 3/4 of the way through the first episode. Cable and streaming services have fallen into a habit of front loading their series with salacious content and unnecessary nudity to grab an audience rather than relying on their audiences' higher functions to engage with their premise for a story. This definitely did the former. However, three months later, I decided to push past the inauspicious beginning to see if there was anything worthy of attention. I'm pleased to say I found it. Fantasy is a favourite genre of mine and this series has great world building using some archetypes from folk lore. The characters were interesting. I don't agree with the reviews that say Orlando Bloom and Cara Delevingne gave poor performances. I believe that the intensity they brought to their characters was confused with wooden portrayals. These character had internal motivation to be intense. The social commentary is obviously paralleled to prejudices, pitfalls and conflicts of the socio-political climate of our day and our history. No matter whether you agree with the views of the writers, it open a point of comparison. The CGI and ambient effects were captivating. Prague brought all the right architectural undertones to house the series. The mystery was intriguing. The production was well resourced. I give this series a 9 (superb) out of 10 and can't wait for the next season. {Fantasy, Steampunk, Crime, Thriller}",/review/rw5088438/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2022,tiktoksweebs,6," Good acting, but entirely too predictable
","First off, the acting is great. Orlando Bloom gets to stretch his legs and work with a good ensemble of actors and decently written dialogue (Jared Harris is a series highlight). It is slower paced, so don't go into this expecting the ""non-stop action"" and snarky humour that Marvel has oversaturated the entertainment industry with. The themes explored are handled in a much too ham-fisted way, simply bludgeoning the audience with a complete and utter lack of subtlety. It would have been more nuanced to explore a Burg set further along socially that has ""accepted"" the Fae, but with more subtle second-class treatment of the Fae citizenry. Instead, it comes across as way too blunt, with every situation being presented as blak and white.",/review/rw5088438/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2019,Kirpianuscus,," what you expect ?
","It is perceived as a political manifesto. About migration, cruel empire, clash of civilisations and competitor against GoT. It is defined as too superficial or dramatic or poetic or brutal. And it is it ! But it is real unfair to ignore the good acting, the seductive story, the beautiful mix of dark romance, crime and the interesting use of music as a sort of voice of atmosphere. It is just impressive, scene by scene, episode by episode. And gives to Orlando Bloom to do a more than interesting and complex demonstration of his talent. In fact, its basic virtue is to give what you expect from it.",/review/rw5088438/?ref_=tt_urv
