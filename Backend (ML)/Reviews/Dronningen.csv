5 March 2020,Bertaut,8," An exceptional and painful film that reminds us men aren't the only ones capable of sexual abuse
","Examining the destructive power of forbidden desire and how sexual abuse can masquerade as consensual seduction, Dronningen (Queen of Hearts) is a film wherein our protagonist becomes our antagonist, where our emotional centre shifts multiple times, where our own morality is examined, where our sympathies are used against us. A psychologically fascinating and morally complex film, in the age of MeToo, Dronningen dares to remind us that women can be the perpetrators of abuse just as men can be its victims.",/review/rw5801602/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2019,danish_mermaid,9," Brilliant close-up of a narcissist
","""Queen of Hearts"" brings you front and center to witness firsthand the maneuverings and manipulations of a feral and ferocious female narcissist. You will gasp and cringe in your seat at the lengths to which the main actress, Trine Dyrholm, goes to hide her misdeeds. This is neither the first nor the last film that showcases a full-blooded narcissist, and narcissists are predictable, but it differs by delivering a stunning in-depth insight into the volcanic and corrupted mechanizations of the narcissistic mind. Sooner or later we all meet a certain Queen or King of Hearts. They walk among us looking and acting deceptively normal. Behind the normal façade is a web of cunning lies and deceptive ploys with one goal in mind: to always and forever be the Queen or the King regardless the cost. If you are open minded this film will give you subtle tips on how to avoid or recognize this kind of behavior and make you reflect on whether you have narcissistic traits yourself. Trine Dyrholm plays the part with such fierce conviction that it sends chills down your spine. This she-devil deserves an Oscar for her performance.",/review/rw5801602/?ref_=tt_urv

","Growing old or up is not something that will be the same for everyone. Also if you marry someone, you may find yourself realizing that you are not entirely fulfilled. Whatever you need to satisfy your need - the question is, how far can you go in making sure you get what you want? Or pursue happiness - it does not always include your partner.",/review/rw5801602/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2019,JvH48,8," Compelling plot, believable characters and unexpected developments. Despite that I usually avoid relational dramas, this one did its very best to counter my usual reluctance
","Saw this at the Rotterdam film festival 2019, where it was part of the Big Screen Competition (another film got the price, alas). Despite that I usually do not like relational dramas, this one involved me due to a compelling plot, believable characters and unexpected developments. It is sad that it does not end well for everyone involved (no details, no spoilers), but I don't think that a different outcome would have been so much better. Main character Anne makes unwise choices, and has to live with the dire consequences, but it is easy for us to say from our comfy chairs.",/review/rw5801602/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2020,Cineanalyst,8," Looking-Glass House
","While the story in ""Queen of Hearts"" is so trite--incest between middle-aged stepmother and teenage son--that it's largely an elaboration of countless porn videos, as well as familiar of more mainstream erotic tales, it's such a superlatively composed picture and one that spirals around a visual pun rooted in Lewis Carroll's Alice books, that it becomes a thoroughly engaging experience. Critically acclaimed and Denmark's entry for the International Oscar, although it wasn't nominated, I may've eventually got around to seeing this anyways, but I was specifically drawn to it because of the references to the ""Alice in Wonderland"" stories, for which I've been seeking out a bunch of related films since reading them. The title itself, ""Queen of Hearts"" (although the original Danish seems to translate directly as merely ""queen""), is an obvious reference to one of Carroll's characters. The first Alice book (the one that actually takes place in Wonderland), at least, is read to the young daughters in a few brief scenes throughout the picture. Carroll's texts are replete with doubling themes, so I also appreciate that the little girls here, although they're minor characters, are twins. What makes the referentiality exceptional, however, is found in the main location, the house and the surrounding forest, and the photography of it.",/review/rw5801602/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2019,dromasca,9," family crisis
","This is the year of family movies, or movies about families. Good movies. The family that is at the center of the Danish film 'Dronningen' or 'Queen of Hearts' is in many ways similar to one of the two families in the Korean film 'Parasite'. It's a wealthy family that lives in a luxurious villa, surrounded by rich vegetation that will play a role in the story and atmosphere of the film. In the two floors villa, designed and furnished according to all the rules of the Scandinavian design, the family of the family of doctor Peter and his wife Anne, a lawyer specializing in crime and teenage abuse cases, lives an apparently happy and quiet life together with their twin girls who have a childhood sprinkled with riding lessons and readings from Lewis Carroll. The balance of the quiet happy family life will be broken by the appearance of the disturbing element represented in this film by Gustav, Peter's son from a previous marriage, a young man just out of adolescence, with some problems and resentments for the early exit of the father from his early life.",/review/rw5801602/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2022,derek-duerden,7," Cycle of Abuse
","They say that, sadly, the abused often go on to be abusers in adulthood. To me the most telling moment in this film is when Gustav is interviewing Anne for his tape recording and she refuses to divulge the identity of her first sexual partner - just saying that ""sometimes what must never happen is what happens"".",/review/rw5801602/?ref_=tt_urv

","You immediately get sucked into their world, and feel a part of the family and situation. It's truly an experience in its own right to watch this movie, because you feel the feelings of the characters and at times feel equally confused and frustrated. It's an emotional rollercoaster that you feel apart of.",/review/rw5801602/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2022,johannes2000-1,9," Excellent, very intense movie.
","The English title ""Queen of Hearts"" seems a bad choice (the Danish title ""Dronningen"" means just ""Queen""!), as if this concerns some Hallmark romance. It is in fact the total opposite: it pictures in a very harsh and cynical way how a self-assured and relentless middle-aged woman (the queen from the title) seduces her vulnerable and traumatized teenage stepson, who is recently brought under the care of her and his father. The consequences for the boy and ultimately for herself are devastating.",/review/rw5801602/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2019,martinsplads,9," Disturbing drama
","I am from Denmark and I have always loved Danish films, Mostly because off the intense drama and real life characters that seems like ordinary people with seriously mental issues just like this movie, Queen of hearts or also called Dronningen. Its about Anne, a woman with a great Swedish husband, two kids and working as a lawyer in a big company, it probably sounds like a good life right? No it isn't. Cause Anne have narcissistic trades that really comes to up to the ground when her husbands son August comes back to live with them for a while. Sexual tension with her new stepson sends Anne into a terrifying game off manipulation and deception that slowly recks her family apart. Right from the first scene this film just grabs your throat and never lets go. Its just so real you literally forgets that you are watching a movie, that what's happen when you just keeps things so damn realistic. No stupid action scenes or monsters just human beings facing terrifying emotional problems. Trine Dyrholm is why this film is almost a masterpiece, her narcissistic performance as Anne is what the hold thing together. I have to warn people about about the sexual scene in this film. They are very disturbing and so disgusting that people may just turn the TV off. Its just a film about a selfish person that you may also exist in the real world. If you like psychological drama from Denmark then don't mis this one.",/review/rw5801602/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2021,riccardomorarm,7," Bourgeois apocalypse (with a twist!)
","I will start by saying that I like the Danish title much better than the English one. ""Dronningen"" means simply ""the queen"", and that is precisely what Anne (Trine Dyrholm) is in her world. Both at home and at work, she is the solid, self-confident and straightforward monarch everybody knows and expects her to be. Everything threatens to break apart when Gustav (Gustav Lindh), her husband's son from a previous marriage, moves from Stockholm to go live with them in the Danish countryside. She will prove ready to everything in her power in order to salvage her marriage and her reputation from downfall, even if this means to turn her back on everything she stands for.",/review/rw5801602/?ref_=tt_urv

15 September 2020,Waedliman,9," Psychological story in an unagitated way
","Denmark has been a country that surprises with very good films for decades now. ""Dronningen"" is one of those examples. Its high quality comes from the unspectacular story-telling which drags the viewer into a downward spiral. Trine Dyrholm as Anne is a wonderful actress. In a minimalistic way she tells us about her life that I don´t know I would like to have, no matter what seems to be good for her on the surface. In the beginning, she loses a case, in the end she loses her dignity and is responsible for the death of a young man she took advantage of. The way she is dealing with the catastrophe of being involved in a relationship that can´t happen, is so unexpected because the rather compassionate woman turns out to be an ice queen. The question if the rather drastic sex scenes are necessary can only be answered with a yes. Gustav Lindh as the young stepson Gustav gives another great performance as well as the supporting actors and actresses. Music, camera, everything add to the high quality of this film.",/review/rw5801602/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2019,mads-129,9," The price of selfism and denial
","A daring tale of a flawed human and the wreckage her actions and consequential denial leaves behind. Most will condemn for being as disgraceful as her deviant actions are despicable. Her decisions are obviously uncalled for morally speaking. The hints of her own victim experience as a child in foster care leaves just about enough of an explanation to reason the actions leading to an unavoidable tragedy. Pretty flawless performances in a tale of human manipulation, loyalty and betrayal - of others and ultimately oneself. In the end the rhetoric philosophical question ends up being - are human beings really in charge of their lives. The answer; surely not when as lost in conditional unethical patterns as this fallen Queen. 8.5 / 10 - for a well scripted and executed tale of taboos and turmoil.",/review/rw5801602/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2020,kaljic,10," Pushing the Envelope
","Queen of Hearts is The Graduate on steroids. This is a fine film. There is a purpose of everything you see on the screen. This is a probing examination of a marriage in the doldrums, spousal alienation and infidelity, forbidden love, and middle aged life on the skids. It is also a sensitive treatment of a taboo subject. The particularly erotic portions of the film could have easily devolved into a tawdry soft-porn movie of sexual depravity. Instead, the remarkable, nuanced, and intense performance of Trine Dyrholm, a main character, and the skillful direction of May el-Toukhy transform this into an extraordinary, unforgettable, film experience. Nuff said. Just watch it.",/review/rw5801602/?ref_=tt_urv

Having an affair with your stepson is not a good idea as we all know. Even more if you are not able to keep it a secret. Although well acted, is the movie very predictable.

","The truth is that the movie except for the porn moment that was superfluous for me, was not annoying in the movie, it was going very well until the end. In the end nothing makes sense, after being counting a movie, with a slowness, a very special tempo, dedicating many shots and moments more times than necessary, but that did not suit them, completely changes the description of various characters and we see several fast sequences, that we do not know well how to understand, each one will understand what they like the most, but really what the director wanted to say, and the film ended.

And then, the plot turns evil.

They have no proper build up to get you to feel for these people. Good acting doesn´t make a good film sadly. A different director could have maybe made it better.
