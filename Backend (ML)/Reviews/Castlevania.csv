2 April 2001,PKozyura,8," another rare find
","Solidly built anime and a pleasure to watch. Character development is believable, although predictable. The story feels slightly sketchy and rushed closer to the end. Bonus points for the absence of ""will be continued in #2"" hint. Absolutely worth watching and owning.",/review/rw8271038/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2006,frozetti,7," Too short...
","The film is quite good. It could even be one of the best I've seen,but... I think 50 minutes is too short. Because of it, the love story between Sawa and Oburi looks a little stupid,and after watching it I had a feeling that something was uncompleted. ",/review/rw8271038/?ref_=tt_urv

8 May 2013,tieman64,," Baby Blue
","Released in 1998, ""Kite"" is a violent anime by director Yasuomi Umetsu. The film revolves around a schoolgirl named Sara who is orphaned in her early teens, whose parents are the victims of a gory double murder and who unwittingly finds herself becoming an assassin.",/review/rw8271038/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2014,siderite,6," Dark desperate mood, but still a failed anime
","The animation was a little strange, although I couldn't say it was bad. The problem was with the depiction of emotions on the characters faces, they all looked a little off. The same issue can extend to the characters themselves, though. It is difficult to empathize with any of them and the rushed nature of the script doesn't help.",/review/rw8271038/?ref_=tt_urv

8 July 2018,mhorg2018,6," A bit overrated
","Kite is an orphaned girl who kills for her controller, who supposedly saved her. Filled with some real gore, super violent content and a decent story line, avoid the lame live action movie and see this instead.",/review/rw8271038/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2020,kosmasp,7," Weapons of a woman
","Well let's say woman, because it's borderline girl, which would also mean ... let's just say that this is definitely not for kids. Not everything animation is meant or aimed at children. Even when it haves little ones in them. A lot of nudity and a lot of blood. And if you watch the uncut version a lot of penetrating too - while it does not linger on intercourse, it still is there and it still may disturb people. It should not disturb more than the violence which is quite graphic, but I'm mentioning it anway.",/review/rw8271038/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2016,xgray-03873,8," A lot better than the live-action U.S. movie adaptation!!!
","This is movie is the primary example of why Hollywood needs to stop making terrible live-action U.S. film adaptations based off of certain anime shows and movies. This anime OAV is basically a simple concept to follow, but the filmmakers of the U.S. live-action version just wanna make it a repeat of Dragonball Evolution. Now the story is actually interesting to watch and the characters have a lot more to offer since it's basically Sawa out to get revenge on only one guy that she had known who was the murderer of her family. Now if the live-action U.S. movie had gotten rid of so many unnecessary crap and just stay true to the original, I would've been fine with that. But, nope. They just made it obvious that I should just stick with the anime, instead.",/review/rw8271038/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2014,williambendavis-933-218958,4," There are much better revenge films out there
","Much to my disappointment, this movie is not that great. It's about a young girl who has been trained as an assassin and her ultimate goal throughout the film is to find and kill the people who killed her parents. Not a terribly original story, but in can be done right. This is a case of doing it wrong. With no explanation, our main character, Sawa, already knows who killed her parents and she's just waiting for the right time to kill them I guess? I don't know why she waited as long as she did to kill them, but whatever. That's not the main problem I have. The main problem is without the hunting down the killer story line, the film is very uninteresting and quite boring. If you want a good revenge film, watch Kill Bill instead.",/review/rw8271038/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2020,Crystal_Dive,5," Not gory, not sexy
",Gratuitous violence and sex scenes plopped in randomly . Spawn (HBO) feels more violent than this despite Kite having scenes of people being shot and blown apart. The violence is comical over-the-top ( just 80s styled blood. No viscera. Other anime series are more violent),/review/rw8271038/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2003,eyesofsociety,9," amazing
","wow, this anime is one of my favorites. the action sequences rule and it has the greatest animation. you just fall in love with the main character as she kills but at the same time remains cute. i wish all animes were like this.",/review/rw8271038/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2009,ivan_thechemist13,8," One of the best adult action movies ever!
","First of all if you have seen Kite I guess that you are at least 18 or you have seen an awfully censored version. The movie begins with a little brutal murder scene and then gets more and more brutal every minutes. Gunfights, murders, child abusing sex scenes - this movie has it all. If you can't take this you better don't watch it, because if you do you will be disgusted and will claim that this movie is only sex and gore. But it is NOT! If you watch full director's edition, you will find how Sawa interacts with people, you will see all of the terrible things that her masters have done and will understand why she is so full of hatred. I don't really think that there was a better way to tell the story. And I don't that there is a better hit-man story, either. Maybe except for Hit-man itself ^^. ",/review/rw8271038/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2003,sykoraggs,8," decent fun mindless & entertaining
","this is certainly not the best anime out there, but dont take it too seriously and have fun with the really twisted story and well thought-out action sequences.  the ending is very rushed.  i had to watch it a couple times until i figured out exactly what happens.  its no akira or space battleship yamato, but kite still delivers good entertainment at a decent level of inteligence.  on some levels kite reminded me of the professional (natalie portman movie).  i've heard some people complain that its too short, but i couldnt imagine this anime being any longer than 50 minutes.",/review/rw8271038/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2001,ep.com,4," Not that great...
","Well, there's no real plot to speak of, it's just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and gratuitous sex (which can sometimes be fun, too, but it's not in this case). What else can I say about this...? The action, when happening, is inventive and there's a cool scene where two characters are falling from a skyscraper (one that has to be several miles high), but overall there's not much to recommend ""Kite"". Watch it if you want, but you're not missing much if you skip this one...",/review/rw8271038/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2001,GreyFox37,8," what a way to make a living
","ok, this is nuts. now, this is another title where a deep grasp of psychological understanding is necessary. now, in my opinion, going around and blowing peoples heads off for no apparent reason is..well..unorthodox. heh. still, if you understand the story, it is a very well thoughtout process of identity. if you like gore and going crazy, kite is for you",/review/rw8271038/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2003,ryanbigman,10," What goes around comes around
","Great anime!   Actions scenes, blood, and a decent story behind it. You'll know what I mean when you watch this movie when I say "" What goes around comes around "".   The end of the movie seems a bit abrupt but the overall quality of it makes up.   10/10.",/review/rw8271038/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2001,tokkichi,," Anime Americans will like
","When I first saw this film, it was the edited American version (its missing nearly 1/2 hour), and I instantly fell in love with it.  I am a huge fan of anime, but I prefer actual movie format (like that of ""Perfect Blue"") as opposed to the OVA format (like the ""Slayers"" series).  This movie had an excellent plot, rapid-fire animated sequences, and alot of violence and weapons-play.  I personally didn't care much for the animator's style, but that is more than made up for in the fluidity of the frames.  Watching the movie in its original Japanese will help answer alot of questions that, due to mouth-syncing shortcomings, were not really addressed.  And, although ""Kite"" (pronounced ""kah-ee-toe"", if one were to read the katakana on the boxfront... pronouncing it like ""kee-teh"" will mean something entirely different in Japanese) is missing that 1/2 hour of footage, there is nothing really lost in the plot or motif.  Anyone who does not watch this film superficially will put the missing details together by context clues throughout.  Overall I say that if you can, get the video in its original Japanese, with subtitles in English if necessary...get the raw feel for the film. However, the full unedited version, if you're interested, is only available in Japan, and Hong Kong, I believe.  The video and DVD formats used there aren't programmed to play on American players.  So, if you want to see it uncut, you'll have to see it in the country of origin.",/review/rw8271038/?ref_=tt_urv
