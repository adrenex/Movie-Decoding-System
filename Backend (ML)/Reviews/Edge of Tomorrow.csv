20 September 2021,mattcording,8," This is what happens when governments let you down!
","My sons were in this sector and and struggled on a daily basis to perform their duties, no matter what B/S we hear from them this government this happened, and it was disgusting! This is extremely well acted, and from 2 of the best current actors in this country, both Comer and Graham are exceptional, and very ably supported by the rest of the cast.",/review/rw7355854/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2021,shezza72,10," Powerful drama about the brutal reality care homes faced across the UK
","Just watched this on All4. Very powerful and emotional drama highlighting the plight most care homes faced as the services collapsed because of high volume of calls and lack of preparedness scandously neglected by the authorities and Government with regards to updated safety procedures and availability of PPE equipment. The GOV (Matt Hancock) lied saying these care homes were being prioritised and kept in special bubbles, when in reality they were forgotten. Great acting by the legendary Stephen Graham and Jodie Comer. Made my heart sink watching this.",/review/rw7355854/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2021,paul2001sw-1,9," Out of sight, out of mind
","The worst of all the mistakes of the COVID pandemic was surely the decision, taken in the UK and elsewhere, to discharge sufferers directly from hospital into unprotected care homes. That's the kind interpretation: the worse one is that, either consciously or subconsciously, the powers that be decided to write off the lives of the victims, their new co-residents, and the care workers, in the vain hope that this might isolate the problem. Jack Thorne's excellent drama 'Help' captures what it must have been like to live through this epidemic of death. A strong cast and some telling writing make for harrowing viewing; the care home owner is a particularly interesting role, although the focus is very much on Jodie Comer's and Stephen Graham's characters. What we don't see is the story from the point of view of the most vulnerable themselves; instead, Graham plays a younger man with a different (but less immediately lethal) weakness. But it's powerful stuff, and the best drama I've yet seen about the coronavirus crisis.",/review/rw7355854/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2021,losanatuisawau-979-435245,10," It's nothing but the truth, an insight on what care homes actually went through during the pandemic!
","I can't exaggerate enough over how well this film was put together. Not only mentioning the fact Jodie Comer has yet again done an amazing job with this role but her and Stephen Graham's chemistry really brought the characters to life and showed us what it was like having dementia and caring for someone with dementia. Trust me, it's not easy.",/review/rw7355854/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2021,nancyldraper,9," Tender and terrifying
","Wow! This drama is a little too close to the truth. As I watched it, in Canada, we are entering the 20th month of the pandemic and what they are now calling the 4th wave. The pandemic is now a new way of life but this movie takes us back to the ignorance of those initial months and, I confess, I cringed at every false move we watched play out and relived some of the trauma I underestimated when going through it. The story is tender and terrifying. The performances are brilliant. Jodie Comer deserves highest accolades and awards for her delivery (for those who have only seen her perform in borrowed accents, it will be a treat to hear her speak in her own native, Liverpudlian accent). For those viewing this in the UK, this seems to trigger political outrage, but, I think, worldwide, we were staggering in the dark and I'm not convinced any political party would have charted a better course. We simply didn't know and were ill prepared. I give this film a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Drama}",/review/rw7355854/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2021,SamJamie,10," Gripping.
","Sarah (Killing Eve and Free Guy's Jodie Comer) is hired as a care worker at Sunshine Homes. The job is relentless, demanding and unglamourous. They're still under-staffed, even following her arrival. Breakfast becomes a full-scale clean-up operation when a resident flings a bowl of cornflakes onto the floor.",/review/rw7355854/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2021,dianebrookes-39160,10," Brilliant
",I worked in a care home at covid time so I know what it was like and it was just like this show portrays Jodie Comer and Stephen Graham play their parts so well well done had me in tears going back to a time when the elderly was seriously let down.,/review/rw7355854/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2021,ks-60500,7," No help
",Just a powerful movie showing the situation in a elderly care house during covid outbreak. Been read news but can't imagine how brutal scenes it could be. All scenes are real I believed and painful when watching this. Good movie to bring is truth and reality. Real hero for what Sarah did and all nursing along.,/review/rw7355854/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2021,ellsiemai,10," Broke my heart
","This piece of writing truly broke me inside and it made me feel so many things, anger being the main one. Jodie Comer and Stephen Graham's performance was nothing short of authentic and gut wrenching; they told this story with such care and honesty. They didn't shy away from the brutal truths of how the government really let the care home's down. The part on the radio where they were talking about how they had been looking after the carehomes really struck a nerve in me, it made me feel sick. The government is vile for letting these vulnerable human beings, these families in carehomes across the country, be totally pushed aside and left to rot. I thought Sarah's character was badass for taking Tony into her care and getting him out of a place that was only going to kill him. Tony was a beautiful character, I fell in love with him as much as I fell in love with Sarah. The part where he helps, you can see clear as day the man he truly is, he's a hero as Sarah said. Jodie Comer breaking the fourth wall at the end of the show hit me deeply, Sarah said is straight; we walk by these vulnerable people every single day and it's as if we don't have any humanity for them, it's sickening. Help when you can. Be better.",/review/rw7355854/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2021,wakster,4," Last 20 minutes could of been so much better
","I thought the last 20 minutes of this was where it all went wrong, the suspense really didn't work for me as the story just went really stupid.",/review/rw7355854/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2021,leavymusic-2,9," Is there any hope of Help?
","There appears quite few low ratings of Help by either people who didn't like the second act to the end, well it is a drama and I thought the second half brought it out well, no matter.",/review/rw7355854/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,Neptune165,5," I did feel the story did end on a bad tangent
","First half, or rather three quarters... brilliant, just impeccable...then it all turns to bizarre. Why? It could've been such a brilliant film. I still think the first half is really eye-opening and heart-warming...so wholesomely heavy, as it were...but then towards the end it just gets...bizarre. Perhaps they were in a hurry to release it while it's still relevant and they just wrapped it up with the first thing they could think of. But hey, at least they didn't care.",/review/rw7355854/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2021,michael-kerrigan-526-124974,8," Did it need the final third?
",Just watched Help. Excellent. Thought it was a bit far fetched in the final third but the great acting by the ubiquitously brilliant Stephen Graham and Jodie Comer made up for that. Jodie Comer has earned Hollywood should she wish - I hope she doesn't go there... Think it would've been better as an hour long drama set in the care home only. Did not need the final third. Was enlightening though about the care profession and made me think. 8 out of ten.,/review/rw7355854/?ref_=tt_urv

7 October 2021,AlienRefugee,6," Was going great... Then drops off
","I'm not the only reviewer saying this, I know, but the final act of the movie / series is really unnecessary which is a shame. The writing is perfect up until that last part which seems a little rushed. I was hoping that the authorities were going to blast in and demand to know why Sarah was using a patient when she had no assistance and lecture her about the lack of PPE and various thins that she was unable to obtain due to the negligence of the health system... Instead we we end up with strange set of events that make us feel less supportive of the lead character.",/review/rw7355854/?ref_=tt_urv
