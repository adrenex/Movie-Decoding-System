3 April 2012,Rodrigo_Amaro,9," Brilliant in all possible ways
","Here's an warming real life story transformed into a lovely TV film. It all starts when writer Alexander Masters (Benedict Cumberbatch) having plenty of available time on his hands decided to write the story of a homeless man he met while coordinating an campaign to release from prison the directors of a project that helps homeless people. The man in question is Stuart Shorter (Tom Hardy), an troubled and angered young man who has been arrested several different times, who suffers from a muscular dystrophy and lots of other problems as well but who happens to impress Alexander in a unusual way with some smartness, his humor and a great sense of friendship. And it is Stuart that gives Alexander the idea of writing his story in backwards. ""Make it involving, do it like Tom Clancy. What murdered the little boy I was?"" he says. And here begins the journey of finding who Stuart was and why he is the way he is now.",/review/rw7073267/?ref_=tt_urv

","Really worth watching. A great performance by Tom Hardy (it's serious but the comic parts are done very brilliantly too, with a touch of Boycie from Only Fools and Horses). ",/review/rw7073267/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2013,nuttylou1980,10," warm hard hitting brilliance
","This film is outstanding. Hardy has done a fantastic portrayal of stuart. This i know as my husband knew stuart shorter. The film is funny in places and warm hearted, but also very hard hitting. It made me cry because of how sad stuart was towards the end of his life. An alcohol drug addicted man who didn't see any real way out of his lifestyle. ""convict curry"" makes me laugh each time i watch it. I've lost count of how many times i have watched this film. I also have the book which is also a must have. This shows how two people from very very different backgrounds can become a huge part of each others life. And just how dark and sad somebody can become because of awful events in their life. Overall i love this film and if ever i did have the pleasure to meet mr tom hardy i would shake his hand and thank him for his superb work.",/review/rw7073267/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2008,d-taker,9," Great film!!! Watch it!!!
","This is the first time I've commented on IMDb but this film deserves to be seen by more people so I thought I'd give it another positive review. To begin with I thought Tom Hardy, who played Stuart, turned in an excellent performance and I'm sure we'll see plenty more from him in the future. Despite being a knife-wielding, psychopathic, booze hound even from the beginning, I felt empathy for his character, its hard not to. All of the acting is as good as the script allows but Hardys performance just shines through. However its really the story, told backwards, thats the reason this is such a enchanting film. Having read the book a couple of days ago i can also add this film, refreshingly, is very true to, and just as good as, the book. I've no idea if it was on TV or has been released on DVD, but if you get the chance watch this film, its thought provoking, heart wrenching, enthralling, funny, stomach churning, touching and it will be an eye opener to a lot of people.",/review/rw7073267/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2013,Oopsy66,10," A sensational story about the people that are ignored in today's society
","A wonderful story told in a superb manner. WHY WHY hasn't this movie gone beyond UK. Unfortunately i have to say I saw this story on Youtube during my search of Tom Hardy movies after watching Warrior. I was completely mesmerized by the acting in this movie by both leading actors. Tom brought his soul into his character and I felt I knew what his Stuart was thinking just by his expressions etc. Tom Hardy is definitely someone to look out for, not for anything but his true ability to 'act'. I only wish I had the opportunity to see him on stage one day. This story is a must for all to see, see the story about faces of the people you walk past in the streets each day, the people that you ignore and forget about it. I highly recommend you take the time to watch it.",/review/rw7073267/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2008,heatherwz,8," Could you reach out ... befriend ... and accept a person time and circumstance has destroyed
","I usually don't enter comments on movies but, for this I had to to ask all viewers to place themselves in the life of someone who's darkest days will carve forever who they are into their soul in the most tragic way. Could you try to begin to understand without judgment? Could you bare witness to one's self destruction up close and personal and accept that all they will take from you is understanding and acceptance, no help for they will not choose to life? So many times we mistreat people like Stuart... we fail to understand to them to offer them our hand if only for a minute, just to treat a human like a human.... This was a fantastic movie. Stuart even in his drunken and for the most part hard to understand words made me hope that this movie would have a rainbow at the end, that he would recognize his importance to the world that had gone terribly wrong for him. He was a lovable character even in his dizziest state. He was intelligent and caring just not to himself. If you truly do what you must at times, which is struggle to understand what he says you will recognize his intelligence. He could focus to create change in something, he could decide to take a bull by the horns and fight for something as he does when the two individuals who help the homeless that are wrongfully imprisoned. Saving himself however was not something Stuart would have considered. The end leaves you questioning what really happened. Give this movie a shot. Dare to compare yourself to Alexander. Pose a tough question to yourself, how do you really treat others? I mean everyone... not just the homeless drunk but, the girl who made your burger at the drive-thru take away ... the fella who cleaned the bathroom at your office. We have become a society who are so self absorbed and self serving.. Could you pass the man on the street like Stuart and in the quiet of your own head throw a blessing to help that person find a light in the dark ?.. or do you pass them in disgust mumbling what a worthless human he is, treating them as societies throw a ways? This film was amazingly well acted, touching, and in the end I wished I could thank Alexander for his unconditional never judgmental way of living with and loving Stuart.",/review/rw7073267/?ref_=tt_urv

8 April 2018,slaphappy-76398,10," Just more proof of how awesome Tom Hardy is!
","I am always blown away by how Tom Hardy uses his voice & body to become a character, fictional or non-fictional. I can't wait to see another film with him in it...I've seen 'Mad Max:Fury Road', 'Dark Knight Rises', 'Inception' and 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy', twice apiece. 'Legend' I have seen three times. He is an actor you just can't stop watching.
I am very puzzled in the above list of plot keywords: pubic hair? male frontal nudity? Why are those the terms listed, instead of :alcoholism, addiction, friendship, childhood trauma?
I do agree with the person who stated this a film most people should see. Addiction has a vice-like grip on large numbers of the globe at this time. This film could open eyes to how to navigate the social issue of addiction.",/review/rw7073267/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2009,ThrowntoReality,8," It's good even after repeated viewings

22 May 2015,tohu777,8," Brutally human...and offers no easy answers
","The first reel of this film is very deceiving: you might well think that it's a kind of dramedy, a clich√©d story of a do-gooder yuppie activist expanding his horizons and finding his humanity through an acquaintance with a very quirky homeless man. But it's absolutely nothing of the sort. To judge by interviews with BBC producers, the director, and writer Alexander Masters, the final film matches the intentions they had from the start, to make something that wasn't easy and which captured this man Stuart Shorter in all his complexity.",/review/rw7073267/?ref_=tt_urv

11 June 2021,joiningjt,9," Monsters are created NOT born!! Tom hardy AGAIN becomes someone else, absolutely PHENOMENAL performance!!
","Christian bale was my favorite actor I have many but it's the old have to pick 1 on a deserted island question. Tom hardy is now that #1 for me after 3 mind blowing movie performances this 1 was the 3rd, last week was bronson and the take was the 3rd. This us after many other performances but these 3 I had never heard of. If you want to take an acting class and see a professor in action WATCH those 3 performances. This moviexwas so incredibly moving, it just shoes how we vilify crimes and people without knowing why they do those things. We just want revenge and so called justice by not addressing the problem but making it worse. What stuart lived through was torture, hell, and we helped him by making it worse!! Why cure a problem when we can just store it away behind bars. Movie is a solid 8 but tom hardy is a OUTSTANDING 10!!!! Watching mr Hardy in a movie I never see him it's always the characters I see!!",/review/rw7073267/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2022,melwinbauer,5," Good acting but boring
","At the end of the day, this probably wasn't worth the watch to be honest. Tom Hardy is cool, he and Benedict Cumberbatch deliver good performances, and the story is a bit interesting when taking the fact that it is a real story into account. However, the film is just boring, plain and simple.",/review/rw7073267/?ref_=tt_urv

29 April 2020,watcher2019,10," great story
","Yes everyone who is homeless has a story but they dont all meet someone who can tell it for them. No one wants to sleep on the streets unless it is the lesser of 2 evils. At times i have to tell friends this, who have a nice comfy life and think it is ok to sneer at the homeless. Lucky them i say. Imagine as a youngster life is so bad you choose to sleep on the very dangerous streets rather then go home to the monsters. Never an easy life. This film didnt really deal with Stuart living on the streets but why he came to be there.",/review/rw7073267/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2008,Shaca69,10," Superb adaptation of a tragic eye-opening biography
","Alexander Master's book, Stuart: A Life Backwards, is a masterpiece and probably influences my rating here but I think this adaptation for the BBC captures all the elements of the story extremely well. Whilst some of the detail of the tragic events of Stuart's childhood are given little airtime, the impression is not lost and reflects the need to stick to 90 minutes per the BBC's commission rather than being the result misguiding adaptation.",/review/rw7073267/?ref_=tt_urv

","I got very emotional when I watched this movie. There's just something about it that seemed genuine and real. Tom Hardy's acting was unbelievable, he really got into character. The story is heartbreaking from beginning to end and I think they did a good job on getting that fact into the movie.

","Every criminal, no matter how bad has stories that wake the empath in you. There are incidents in life that murder the innocence in people. When did they become who they are and why did they become who they are? Wasn't it us, the people around them? Couldn't we have listened, couldn't we have understood? What does it take to save a boy?
..
A picture of Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy together led me to watch this movie and I hadn't expected what an emotional and thought provoking journey it would turn out to be. It was Tom Hardy's acting and Benedict's narration that made this movie so extraordinary for me that at times I felt like I was watching their real life stories unfold before my eyes. Tom Hardy is such a diverse actor.",/review/rw7073267/?ref_=tt_urv
