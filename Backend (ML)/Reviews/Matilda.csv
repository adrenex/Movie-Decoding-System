23 April 2011,planktonrules,9," Exceptionally well done though it's not the sort of film for everyone...but what movie is?
","I have very little interest in most action films or violent movies, so I am not the sort of person that would normally watch a film like ""Heat"". However, on a lark and because it's apparently such a good film I decided to give the film a look. Well, I must say that thought I was not in love with the film it sure was exceptionally well made and had a lot to offer--even for folks like me.",/review/rw1964748/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2021,kevin_robbins,10," You find yourself rooting for both sides the entire film.
",Heat (1995) is a movie that is in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows an underground high end burglary team looking for one big last mission and a parallel story about a successful police officer who is struggling at home. As the buildup to the big heist unfolds the two worlds come closer and closer together until the ultimate collision happens.,/review/rw1964748/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2006,ccthemovieman-1,10," One Of The Best Crime Films Ever
","I really believe this is one the great crime movies of all time. It has some drawbacks that wouldn't make me recommend this for family viewing - tons of f- words by Al Pacino and a few bloody scenes, but as far as a fascinating crime story: wow!",/review/rw1964748/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10," Brilliant
","This is a brilliant film. While clocking in at a nearly three-hour running time, there isn't a single wasted scene, it is always entertaining and I think it is very rewatchable too. The cinematography, locations and scenery are superb, and the film's atmosphere and pace are also terrific. The story is plausible and beautifully structured with a breathtaking sequence towards the middle of the film, and there are a lot of memorable quotes. Heat is also brilliantly directed by Michael Mann and the acting of Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino is exemplary. So all in all, brilliant and absolutely worth it. 10/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw1964748/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2021,lareval,10," Michael Mann's finest work
","A brilliant character driven action thriller with drama and emotion all the way. Despite the long runtime, the pacing never drags. The Magic of this action movie is that you believe the people you see in the screen. You care for them and everything they go through. All of the scenes are influential, the script and the score are iconic. Two thumbs up!",/review/rw1964748/?ref_=tt_urv

","One of the amazing things about Heat is that during an almost three hour running time of the film, your interest in what happens in the summit teaming of Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro never flags for a second. Part of the reason is because these guys are at the top of their profession and brought their A game to the parts. ",/review/rw1964748/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2000,aboriginee,10," The best character film of all time.
","Sound like a bold statement? Devotees of classic cops and robbers flicks of old will no doubt take exception, but I believe that Michael Mann achieved some measure of perfection with Heat. To break this three-hour gem of a film down to its core, this is a film about men - strong men - and the supporting role that he women of the film have on them for better or worse. Take Pacino as good cop Vincent Hanna: one of the most intense characterizations of the tragic hero that I have ever witnessed, as he laments the demise of his third marriage to a pill-junkie wife. A fact which he discusses with his archnemesis (De Niro) in what history will regard as one of the most frenetic scenes in the history of film. The dialogue in this scene (at the very end of the first tape, if you own the VHS version) sets up the last half of the film beautifully, as our two rivals come to the joint realization that they have no hand in choosing the paths that will lead them to their ultimate confrontation: their very natures so define their respective actions that any attempt to do otherwise would simply be a waste of time. While I have heard others (who I am ashamed at times to call close friends) say that Heat drags in places, I will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time (I'm sorry not every director is Jerry Bruckheimer), there are poignant developments of character in Heat that many would casually disregard. I am thinking of the interaction between the ex-con who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss, and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. But there is a catharsis that I felt for that same ex-con when De Niro's character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score, for old time's sake. Who doesn't feel for this guy - this minor character in a film with big-time heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. That's what Heat is really: a series of brief moments, some touching, others traumatic, and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time, Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action. Come hungry.",/review/rw1964748/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2000,jamie-109,10," Heat is truly epic, absolutely breathtaking
","One of the most amazing things about Heat is the scale of the film; it is nearly three hours long and packed to bursting with mind-blowing visuals. It seems one of Michael Mann's main priorities was to make a film with a dreamlike feel to it, to portray LA as a dusty oil-painting on which complex characters could play out their lives. One of the main themes is the similarity of the career criminal and the street-wise cop. It is fascinating to find yourself really feeling for DeNiro's tragic bank-robber, a man of philosophical merit who realises he's stuck in a life of crime he doesn't want to lead. Pacino's cop is less easy to sympathise with, but he too leads an in-escapable life of guns and crime. What really stands out is the climax. On the whole, Heat has to be the best cops n' robbers film ever made, indeed, one of the best films. An epic, wonderful, sad, adrenaline-fuelled exercise in scale and grandeur.",/review/rw1964748/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2020,Jouford,6," I obviously don't get it ...
","Let me start by saying that Heat isn't a terrible movie. In fact, it's not a bad movie at all. I just think that it's incredibly overrated.
I'm not a huge fan of Michael Mann's work in general. I find his films to be no more than very long music videos. His movies seem to epitomise style over substance to me, and Heat is no different.
DeNiro and Pacino chew through the scenes like they normally do. That's a given. The rest of the cast are as competent and watchable, but the film doesn't feel deep enough for me. Though judging by the way everyone else is rating it, I must be missing something, even after watching it three times.
I'm sorry that I don't like this film. It's got all the right ingredients to be special, but, as far as I'm concerned, it's undercooked.",/review/rw1964748/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2009,tieman64,," Gangster Movies: Part 2
","The flaw of all gangster movies, at least those acknowledged as ""classics"" (Godfather trilogy, Scarface, Goodfellas, Casino, White Heat, Once Upon A Time In America etc), is how obvious and predictable their narrative progressions are. We get the rise, the joyous ecstasy of crime and the obvious monetary rewards, and the fall, that period where the world violently collapses around the criminal. With the scripts all so loosely similar, it just becomes a game of dress up. Of who has the best period details, acting and set design.",/review/rw1964748/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2005,eddieknocker,10," One of the best films of the 90's
","I am assuming I am commenting on this film for those who have not seen this film and for those people I pity you. Its a crime thriller. Won't describe the story as its not particularly original and not the best thing about this film. You've got Pacino and Deniro on screen in a film for the first and possibly last time which should be recommendation enough. You've also got director Michael Mann at the top of his game. An awesome supporting cast firing on all cylinders. Arguably the best ""shoot-out"" in any film - ever. What more do you want???",/review/rw1964748/?ref_=tt_urv

15 September 2003,Theo Robertson,7," Good But Overlong
","The thing to strike me about HEAT is that it`s overlong . I don`t know if I`ve been watching too much MTV but a major problem I`ve had with a great number of movies coming out of Hollywood studios since the early 1990s is that they`re too long for their own good and I wish to add HEAT to this list since its running time is taken up with too many unnecessary scenes . If these scenes had been ditched at script stage not only would we have had a shorter film we`d have had a far better one . Take the scene in the coffee bar where the gang have just carried out the initial heist and Neil teaches Waingro a lesson  by banging his head off the table . Seeing as they`re shown throghout the story to be well organised , professional villains why would Neil draw attention to themselves by assaulting Waingro in this way ? It`s a scene that lacks any credibility and should not have been included . There`s another problem with too many domestic scenes , the film tries to show the audience the marital marital/romantic life of every major character , cop and robber . I know Michael Mann`s later movie THE INSIDER is also full of scenes involving home life but that`s necessary to the plot and characterisation . Here it is not ",/review/rw1964748/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2021,jdring2007,9," a masterpiece crime drama/action hybrid with memorable performances
","I'd give this a 10 if it weren't for the drawn out ""climax"" and the whole tangent between De Niro and his woman. I understand the necessity of that element, but his character is so indifferent throughout that it lost me completely. That said, about his character, I get it; he isn't supposed to be flamboyant, he's rigid and unforgiving, he lives by a strict creed, and De Niro nails it flawlessly. He just isn't nearly my favorite character. And there's so many to pick from! Heat offers you a slew of people to latch onto, emotionally and empathetically, or even apathetically. Every character showcases his own qualities and flaws, making even the bad guys likable in some cases, but when it comes right down to it they are, clear as day, the bad guys. And all the actors and actresses put on stellar performances. Al Pacino especially; Val Kilmer was a favorite for me, and even Waingro, as despicable a man as he was in the movie, depicted so memorably by Kevin Gage. Even Danny Trejo, who is such a small role, has. Subtle yet powerful performance in the third act. And then there's the action. While the movie is undeniably long, it isn't boring, with the exception of my aforementioned gripe with De Niro's romantic tangent. Aside from that, even when guns aren't blazing (every gunfight is raw and gritty and intensely filmed), there is action to be had. The script is ingenious and cinematography immersive. Have seen multiple times and will watch again in the future.",/review/rw1964748/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2022,searchanddestroy-1,10," Is it possible to put more than ten stars?
","Al Pacino is definitely attached to the greatest crime gangster movies in film history: THE GODFATHER trilogy, SCARFACE, CARLITO'S WAY. And so Bob De Niro too: THE GODFATHER 2, ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA, THE GOOD FELLAS, CASINO. To summarize, because of the presence of these two giants, this movie which I talk now is also to be put on the list, and maybe on the top of it. For me it is the best cop gangster - armed robbers - scheme ever made, and a model, a reference for ant real gangster in the US and Europe. This movie is simply perfect, flawless, tense, taut, gripping, outstanding; unless to hate this kind of movie - and you have the right to - it's impossible to ignore it, this would be an heresy. Acting, directing, editing, everything is purely chiseled like a jewel, a diamond. We could see this as a kind of US remake of Jean Pierre Melville's LE DEUXIEME SOUFFLE where De Niro would have Lino Ventura's role, and Pacino Paul Meurisse's one.",/review/rw1964748/?ref_=tt_urv

3 January 2000,stickman-6,10," Heat is a masterpiece
","In this exciting thrill ride, good and evil battle it out.  But not in the usual comic-book style of most films today.  ""Heat"" carries with it the moral values so many of us take for granted.  Although much in the film is morally ambiguous, one may find that even when all your life you've lived on the other side of the law, you can still settle down and have a heart-to-heart.  When I first saw this movie I was sure it would be another violent crime movie that I would never want to see again.  I have since seen it 4 times and have a copy of my own.  The thrilling sequences and brilliant camera-work have you glued to the screen.  The exceptional cast of characters has you wondering ""who could be so lucky to work with them?"". From the opening scene to the thrilling final scenes and everything in between (including the climax) ""Heat"" grabs you and pulls you in.
