11 October 2012,Sylviastel,10," This Show is a Winner! Can't wait to next week!
","I can't say enough about this drama. Connie Britton also produces plays Rayna James, a veteran country music star. She does a fabulous job in the role and should be getting an Emmy for it. Hayden Panetterie whom I watched when she was on Guiding Light years ago is fantastic as Juliet Barnes, a rising star. She does a fantastic job in her role. Powers Boothe plays Rayna's father and is brilliant in his supporting role. Eric Close is fine as Teddy Conrad, Rayna's husband. The best part of the show is that it is filmed on location in Nashville, Tennessee and it shows with landmark sites like the Ryman Auditorium, the Grand Ole Opry, the Bluebird Cafe, and others. The series shows light on the country music set, politics, and the relationships and dynamics among them. Can't wait for the next episode! This show is a winner!",/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2012,lasherxl,9," So Impressive!
",Now lets just start off by saying I had already expected to like this show. I'm a big fan of the 2 female leads and reading and hearing all the buzz and what i'd seen in previews I had a feeling we were in for something special.,/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am just blown away by every aspect of this night-time ""soap."" The music, the singing, the story-line, the acting; just everything is amazing.",/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2012,koltinthompson,10," Expectations: Surpassed!
","A few months ago, I saw a teaser on ABC advertising this new show ""Nashville."" At the time, I was skeptical of the show, dismissing it as just another one season wonder. I assumed it would employ pointless sexuality, unrealistic dialogue (done in cheesy southern accents), and plot points that ventured outside of likelihood.",/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2012,Lewis01-228-458550,9," If You Love Music
","I have seen the first two episodes and in each I was mesmerized by the music. While I deeply enjoy all kinds of music from classical to heavy metal, truth be known that I have never really followed country. That is until this show grabbed hold of me from its inception. At first I thought that the music was dubbed, but it is not and what amazes me is the singing talents of Connie and Hayden. The duet sung by Clare and Sam was mind blowing. Not just the singing but the camera work and the looks on the faces of the actors was as much apart of the song as the voices. If you didn't feel anything from viewing and listening to it you must be on the slab at the coroners.",/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2013,mariajoaou27,7," Absolutely perfect show
","I should begin by saying that I'm not usually a fan of dramas. If a show doesn't make me laugh, then most likely, I won't keep up with it. I am, however, a big country music lover so I decided to give this show a shot. I ended up watching three episodes in a row and had to stop myself or else I would just forget about my real life obligations.",/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2012,mtzakowich,10," Great original TV show
","This is a great TV show with great actors and great music!!! By far one of the best new shows of the season!!!!! The story lines have tonnes of potential and the music gets better and better!!!! Its different than a lot of the TV out there, it's not the same old, same old. People watch this show and stop with all the reality crap!!! I am tired of good television shows getting cancelled before they are ever given a chance. You don't have to be a country music fan to watch this show, I'm not and I've already downloaded some of the songs they were that good. You just have to like good TV with good stories and appreciate good music. And this is good TV",/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2012,martinj918,9," Total (enjoyable) surprise
","I'm not particularly a fan of country music so I watched this first out of simple curiosity. Now I'm hooked. Why? The MUSIC in this show is terrific. I have actually bought two of the songs from i Tunes. And, like I said, I'm not a fan of country music. The plot is FUN. It's interesting. Some reviewer said that it was an obvious plot, but my god, this is TV and if the plot is obvious then so is the on button on your remote. The plot is FUN and it moves -- fast. When some character acts like a jerk his retribution is swift. When two young people look lovingly at each other in the next scene they are bonded. If the rich guy has a reputation for buying his way into politics in the next scene he DOES IT. It's TV and it's fun. The music in the show is amazing to me. I'm a classical music kind of guy but I melted over the performances of ""Fade Into You"" and ""If I didn't know better"". Also, the talent who sings these songs is new to me and they have intriguing voices. Surprisingly, one is an Australian and the other is English but they know how to do lovely singing.",/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2012,brucedent,," Outstanding
","Connie Britton lives up to her terrific work on Friday Night Lights, and is very impressive for her work as this series' producer. The Nashville location filmed long shots are absolutely breath taking, and prompts an interest to visit Nashville. The great music is worth the time in itself, thanks in part to the Executive Music credit work by music legend T Bone Burnett. The show has a great working cast on several levels from several TV veterans (Connie Britton, Eric Close & Powers Boothe etc) coupled with a glitzy locale; strong story lines; humour; great music and a ""new look for TV"" at the music industry. I can't wait to see how this series' plot develops.",/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2014,atlasmb,9," Great Music set in a Country Soap Opera format
",Nashville is a country soap opera filled with big talents and big sounds. You can come to it because you like soap operas. You can come to it because you like country/folk music. Or you can come to it because the show is the perfect fusion of the two.,/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv

8 July 2018,newtonnola,5," Needs new story lines
","The main problem with Nashville is it started out sting but after say the season 2 they just kept recycling storylines. It's ridiculous. I've never seen this happen in any other show. The music is great, the acting fantastic but nothing new happens. They also start to introduce a new character only to have them completely disappear with out any explanation.",/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv

","My best advice to anybody is watch season 1-4, it is beyond amazing but don't ruin the series by even bothering with season 5 and 6.",/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2020,l-iizzy,9," Great show!
","I love this show. First of all because the music is real and it's not a show with a million already super famous people who's voices get autotuned to make it sound good. Second of all, I think the acting is great by most of the actors and the storylines are very moving and make you want to keep watching to find out the whole story.",/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv

","Man oh man this show is so REAL and RAW. Believable situations, real emotions wow I'm blown away by the actors.... This is definitely a good show I'm just sorry I took so long to watch it and it was always because I didn't like country but some of the songs on here are awesome. That just goes to show don't judge a book by its cover.",/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2012,Togmonity,7," I think it's a fading star....

25 May 2016,SnoopyStyle,7," solid country music soap
","The stories center on the country music scene in Nashville. Rayna Jaymes (Connie Britton) is a fading star. She's married to Teddy Conrad (Eric Close) with two girls. Deacon Claybourne (Charles Esten) is the love of her life. She's being challenged by new pop star Juliette Barnes (Hayden Panettiere). Deacon's niece Scarlett O'Connor (Clare Bowen), Avery Barkley (Jonathan Jackson), and Gunnar Scott (Sam Palladio) are aspiring musicians with love connections. Will Lexington (Chris Carmack) is a singer struggling with his sexuality. Luke Wheeler (Will Chase) is a star and manipulative Layla Grant (Aubrey Peeples) is a wannabe star. Jeff Fordham (Oliver Hudson) is the sleazy producer.",/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv

",Great show until season five... then the same old dragged out story in every episode. Season 1-4 were very entertaining. Five just awful... not doing 6. Would rather poke myself with a hot nail.,/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2018,kollma-372-599819,6," 4 out of 6 seasons
","I'll keep it simple. First four seasons are fun and interesting with lots of stories and twists and aha moments. CMT took over in season 5 and you can instantly feel a difference in the show. Characters are dropped, less focus on the music, poor character development, boring plot lines and a bit of political correctness is thrown in. To sum up. Season 1-4, I would give 9 stars. Season 5-6, 3 stars",/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,Beserkerdude,7," Cool
","Good show, and loved 1st 4 seasons, then it became obvious they would never let rayna be happy and sort of fell off. The acting was great and the songs and performances on stage were convincing. One guy was miscast, Oliver Hudson as Jeff, he is so typecast as lovable goof Adam on rules of engagement. Seeing him as the evil rather manipulative record exec was really had to buy, kind of like Alan Alda as anyone but Hawkeye Pierce from MASH.",/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2022,raptorshark,9," Early seasons are amazing
","Similar to Lost the first seasons are the best then it falls apart. The music, acting, drama, so good it's so addicting!!! I can't remember if it's season 4 or 5 where it turns to garbage, I think 5. Once a major character leaves the show the plot gets weird and the characters you know and love become weak, and it becomes less musically centered. There are some highlights still though.. But at least the first 3-4 seasons are magnificent!!!",/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2021,cortesjsv,9," Surprisingly Good Country Show
","Along with the fact that I listen to country music, this show is also one of the reasons why I want to visit Nashville! Not every show or movie is filmed in the location it claims to be in so who knows if a lot of the scenic scenes were in Tennessee, but if they were- breathtaking. Now to the actors- amazing. Such great actors as well as music artists. Overall, the show has great dialogue, music, acting. I was so sad to see it go. I never watched it while it was on tv, but when I finished the series I CRIED HARD (because of what happens). But I was sad that there was no longer anymore seasons!",/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2013,zacharia94,7," Good writing
","As many have pointed out, the show is a soap opera, though an unusually deft one. Largely due to excellent writing, the characters are convincingly complex and fallible, and the actors--particularly those playing musicians--do a good job of displaying the necessary onstage charisma while dealing with offstage tendencies and problems that are much less glamorous. What these actors don't do very well is sing. Both Connie Britton and Hayden Panettiere have sweet but small voices with no dynamics, and, though I can believe that teen and tween fans have put Panettiere's Juliette on the charts, I cannot believe that Britton's Rayna has stayed on top for a generation, especially as an interpreter of other people's songs. But, as the production of the show's songs is very slick, most viewers will like them, unaware that modern technology can make anyone sound okay. I just wish Callie Khouri had opted to hire a great country singer for Rayna's performances; then I wouldn't have such a hard time appreciating the difference between her ""storied career"" and Juliette's ""flash in the pan."" As it is, they sound more alike than different; Rayna is merely older",/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2021,vixen19840,4," Only downhill from season 5
","I'm not a fan of country music but literally had nothing else to watch so gave it a go. Ended up bingeing seasons 1-4. I liked the main characters and the drama they created but every other side/secondary/additional character I found extremely annoying to watch and could not wait for them to exit the show. Especially Layla. I was irritated every time she came on screen to the point where I skipped past every part with her in it but unfortunately she managed to creep around for 2 whole seasons. It was satisfying to see Avery clue up to the truth and get rid of her. That was the k my episode I could watch entirely when she was in it. I liked Luke. Deacon wasn't too annoying. Teddy should have been killed off in the first two episodes. I'm glad his wife was shot. Scarlett is such a weak person I'm pretty sure she has a noodle for a back bone and she got more annoying with every episode thinking she was so much better than everyone else. Juliette was annoying but one of those characters you love to hate until she grows on you eventually and I ended up rooting for her out of all the characters. Will was likeable. The talk show host that was trying to bring him down for being gay was an absolute rabid beast of an animal, it baffles me that she was able to spout such hateful garbage on national tv and still be employed. Jeff should have died a lot sooner than he did.",/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2017,joeonj,1," Season Five destroyed the whole series
","This series started off to be one of the great ones then season five happened This stuff with trying to make every commercial, series and movie politically correct, needs to STOP. This is a southern music series and the writers decided to create a white female, black male relationship (((AGAIN))) which came across as just that, a desperate attempt to be the same as ALL THE OTHERS. It did not work and DESTROYED the series for me and probably many other fans.",/review/rw3754845/?ref_=tt_urv
