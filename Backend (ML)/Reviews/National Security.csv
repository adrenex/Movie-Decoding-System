16 August 2017,Wizard-8,," Reasonably fun, if you are in the right mood
","As I have said before, I have a soft spot for movies made by Millennium Films, because they are the closest modern day equivalent to the notorious Cannon Films, which made a ton of cheesy but fun B grade movies in the 1980s. The Millennium Films production ""London Has Fallen"" is really a glorified Cannon movie, and that's why I had fun with it. Oh, I will admit that a lot of it is silly and/or bad. The CGI is often kind of cheap, the depiction of the story's terrorists and their intricate plans is really hard to swallow, and the movie is quite predictable. But it's enjoyable all the same. The first twenty five or so minutes are kind of slow, but then it starts delivering almost non stop action until the end. It's certainly never dull, and even a little exciting at times despite the fact you'll know how each scene will end as soon as it starts. I can see why some people would hate this movie, but for me, it was a fun romp. The more you like B movies, the better the chance you'll like this movie.",/review/rw3426063/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2017,jamesharrison-541-835462,7," Suspend your disbelief - it's only a movie
","I enjoyed this film for what it is - yes, none of it's really that plausible, and yes, it's riddled with as many holes in the plot as there are bullet holes the President's Land Rover. Oh, and yes, it's one sided and terribly patriotic - if you're an American - but remember, it's only a film, and a Hollywood Tinsel Town film at that.",/review/rw3426063/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2016,edwardgamper-0-128609,7," Awesome brainless fun
","1 star? Not as good as the first movie? Let's get real! Olympus Has Fallen was equally ridiculous, jingoistic, lacking well-rounded characters, and originality - so why is everyone surprised when London Has Fallen is no different? ",/review/rw3426063/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2017,andrew-gilson13,6," Don't listen to all the ""Movie Buffs""
","Before listening to all of the 1 star reviews, hear me out. To start, if you think you're going to be watching a summer movie blockbuster that's 10/10 than you don't have a great judgement on films. Was the movie plot thin? Sure. Was the acting ""Oscar winning?"" Most certainly not. However, if you enjoy a decent action packed film from start to finish, you may just like this one a little bit. Gerard Butler plays his typical bad ass, ex-marine type character that helps to save the President of the United States. There's your plot. Simple and no more to it. That's what this film intended to give you. A simple plotted movie for action packed movie lovers. So, before you decide to toss this one out, go on Netflix on a boring Sunday afternoon and give it a try.",/review/rw3426063/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2016,Genti25,6," Just fine.
","London Has Fallen is directed by Babak Najafi and include the main cast of Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, and Morgan Freeman. I enjoyed the movie throughout, even though it started off really boring it definitely had some interesting parts here and there. The ending is also quite fun, in a turn-your-brain-off kind of way. What bothered me the most was the editing, which was terrible up until that one-shot sequence at the end, where it finally got a bit better. Gerard Butler is really great on the role, a total badass, even though he was so in a very unrealistic way. The overall character fits with the theme of the movie. Aaron Eckhart is also fine here, as he is in any movie ever. I think this actor is terribly underrated and overlooked no matter what role he is playing. The CGI is pretty underwhelming, they should have increased the budget from the first movie, which was also better in almost every aspect than this sequel. London Has Fallen is not made to be over analyzed, it is just a fun action meaningless, suspenseful and to a point unnecessary movie that's made for 90's action movie fans to enjoy.",/review/rw3426063/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2016,sraavan-narayanan,8," Clich√©d But Still Entertains
","I don't understand why people are being so political here. This is an action movie. in fact one of the best action movies this year. The CGI could have seriously been better cause its ""Hollywood"" but anyways through the movie there is something new and interesting happening. Even though we know where it will end and who and all will survive, still each and every scene turns out to be interesting. Banning surely has a style while shooting terrorists, surely works out. And could have avoided some unnecessary dialogues but still its fun and ought to be seen. The acting was quite casual and could have been more serious in the places where it should have been. But still a movie that every person can enjoy",/review/rw3426063/?ref_=tt_urv

","The British Prime Minister is submitted to a surgery and passes away of heart attack during the recovery. The leaders of the great nations must attend his funeral without a preparation of a security scheme by their secret services. The American President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) travels under the protection of Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), who is responsible for his security. On the arrival at the St Paul's Cathedral, the leaders and the public in general have a massive attack from terrorists disguised as guards and police officers. Mike and the president succeed to flee, but soon they realize that there is no one is trustworthy. The terrorist leader promises to execute the president live for the whole world. Meanwhile the New Scotland Yard leadership comes up to the same conclusion and they activate the alarm system in the city to remove the real police officers from the streets to know who the terrorists are. Further, there is a high-level traitor in the Secret Service. Who might be the traitor? What will happen to the president and Mike? ",/review/rw3426063/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2016,phil-sydney,1," A D grade movie that deserves to go straight to DVD and the bin after that.
","If like me, you liked the original, this will leave you greatly disappointed. No breakdown needed. Just mindless cheese through and through. Whilst the original shocked (in particular the opening scenes) with a grandiose, beyond belief terrorist attack, London has fallen shocks with its stupidity, predictability, poor CGI, complete neglect for any realism (not a even a tad!) and tediously boring action scenes that would be more fitting for a new van dame movie.",/review/rw3426063/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2017,SimonJack,7," Good twist raises this above standard terrorism films
","""London Has Fallen"" is a terrorism film with a novel plot that raises it above the standard Hollywood fare of the genre. The setting in London, with a plot to take out several world leaders. The complex operation has lots of action with associated pyrotechnics, special effects and stunt routines. Considerable CGI is used to show British landmarks exploding. The cast all are good in this action thriller. ",/review/rw3426063/?ref_=tt_urv

14 April 2016,green-33663,1," This movie gets worse by the minute
","How can decent actors accept to be in such a horrible movie? Morgan Freeman must have lost a bet to play a role in this movie. So much crap happens in this movie that basically needs the viewer to remove 99% of any kind of logical thinking. So the UK police, special forces, and military can easily be compromised according to this movie, and in front of real officers who are standing right next to them without wondering, hey who the heck are these guys? Bombs can be placed in every famous building without anyone noticing. Hundreds of bad guys can take over a city and have no army come in to confront them. The solution they found to deal with weading out the imposter forces, recall all the known good forces to sit inside while the bad ones can go about doing their terrorizing. WTF, directors, writers, who did they poll this movie in front of and had a response of ""yeah this all makes sense"". To be left with a feeling of not just wasting time watching the movie (even with forwarding scenes), and then being left with a feeling of how can smart people make such crap, is enough to leave the brain broken. I thought an IMDb rating of 6+ would be a watchable B movie, but this is not even close to watchable, how did this movie not get an avg rating of 3?!!! If you've seen it and liked it, think about this movie with a bit of logic, if you haven't seen it, don't, just don't, unless you enjoy feeling frustrated by stupid things that happen in movies.",/review/rw3426063/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2016,chrisst4,1," Really bad
","In a nutshell: Supposed best of the 'land of free' (the sunny place where everyone is happy and waves their spangley flag) come over to the London (where is constantly rains and everyone is incompetent and rather sad). London is blown-up but that's OK because they end- up single-handedly saving the most important person in the world (the US President of course) - so everything is fine! They do this by using a lot of fairly bad CGI and applying a script of continuous, cheesy one liners. ",/review/rw3426063/?ref_=tt_urv

16 March 2016,RforFilm,2," Exciting? London Has Fallen is a boring, rotten plate of bangers and mash!
","I don't think anyone would have predicted a movie like Olympus Has Fallen to have been the sleeper hit it became. Some people liked to compare it to ""Die Hard in the White House"", though I thought of it as a spiritual sequel to Air Force One, which dealt with the president fighting terrorists on his plane. Olympus Has Fallen may not be one of the great action movies of all time, but I enjoyed it's over the top tone and Gerald Butler still makes for a good action hero. It also kept most of the story confined to the White House, which gave a tighter surrounding and even a tad more intimidating.",/review/rw3426063/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2016,morrells,1," Utter, utter, utter, utter, utter, drivel.
","The worst movie I've had the misfortune to watch in a considerable time. Awful writing, awful acting, just awful in every respect. Not an ounce of realism or believability. Simply staggeringly stupid in every way. The basic premise could have worked, a terrorist attack on London, but absolutely no rational thought was put into the execution of the idea. Lazy, shallow, brain-dead film making. As it went on I actually thought I was watching a parody. Deeply depressing that so much money went into such a poor excuse for entertainment. Very, very sad indeed. I've actually run out of things to say about this movie as there's absolutely nothing to salvage. It's a train wreck. A hopeless, weak, still-born abomination of a movie.",/review/rw3426063/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2017,Sleepin_Dragon,2," A pile of the unmentionable.
","I'll be honest I saw a twenty second trailer and thought this was worth a look, it starts off not too bad, then totally loses the plot, indeed there is no plot. Terrorists annihilate London to hunt down a Saintly American president, oh the irony. There are believe it or not positives, the special effects are impressive, and the scenes of an empty London look particularly eerie. The trouble is so much money went into this film it's almost heartbreaking, when you think of all the other uses for that money. A waste of resources, actors, poor Angela Bassett, if you can get to the end you'll have done well. It makes Sharknado look plausible.",/review/rw3426063/?ref_=tt_urv

","I normally would give this an 8/10 but after seeing all the idiots on here giving it a 1/10, I gave it a 10/10 to try and even out the score. I mean seriously, complaining this is politically motivated and that this would never happen and the plot holes blah blah blah.. IT'S A FICTIONAL ACTION MOVIE! PERIOD! And the action was amazing, non-stop and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Sure there were clich√©s and we've seen these type of action movies before but that's just what they are supposed to be... action = entertainment. Story was excellent and well directed. Clearly all you 1-5 stars have your agendas, but based on dollars, this movie was a box office hit, and I can't wait for the next one! Well done boys!",/review/rw3426063/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2016,dave-mcclain,3," ""London Has Fallen""... straight into the Thames
","When a movie becomes a surprise hit, as the White-House-under-attack-and-President-in-danger actioner ""Olympus Has Fallen"" did in 2013, earning $160 million worldwide on a budget of $70 million, a sequel often follows. Movie Fans (especially those who liked the original), can only hope that ""London Has Fallen"" (R, 1:39) follows the rules of a successful sequel ‚Äì and it does¬Ö partially. Keeping the main characters and also developing them further? Check. Sticking with the basic idea that worked in the original, but changing the setting and details enough to tell a new story? Check. Upping the excitement and action? Check. Telling a better story and making a movie that's superior to the first one? Oooops.",/review/rw3426063/?ref_=tt_urv
