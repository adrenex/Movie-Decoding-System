23 October 2020,ahmedgorshy,10," One of my personal favorites.
","One of my personal favorites.
This series is one of the top 10 series I have ever seen. It is unnaturally refreshing, and it always makes me feel happy or even sad.
The first season is perfect and the second season is better than the first and the third has episodes that I consider the best in the series, so I will say it with confidence. I hope that the fourth and final season maintains its current level and its current rating is 8.3 and deserves to enter the top 250 list in the best list because it is the best.
The gorgeous characters Sam, Casey, Zahid, Evan, Elissa and Doug are all superb.
Even if the fourth season is not good, I hope the series maintains its rating and I hope a comfortable ending

20 November 2019,UniqueParticle,10," Absolutely love Atypical being on the spectrum of ASD
","I relate to so much of the quirky things throughout and enjoy so many scenes! Keir Gilchrist is so great as Sam, crazy how he hasn't been nominated. I rarely use Netflix cause I watch so much other stuff but this is always worth it; I have adapted over the years to love my autism traits even though it's very difficult too! I am so glad ASD has become more known at least to some extent some people don't know what it is and that's always awkward. Regardless of anything Atypical is phenomenal and I always appreciate every episode.",/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2017,MrMcMurphy,7," I have AS, and LOVED IT
",UPDATE: Couldn't finish 3rd Season. The following is for the first two fantastic seasons. Seasons 1-2: 10. Most of Season 3: 4 (it just didn't grip me the same way the first two seasons did--felt like work).,/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv

",I was asked a question on Quora about the show and decided to have a look.,/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2017,robert-b-norby,9," Beautifully warm and funny
","This is a show about the everyday life of a family with an 18 year old boy with autism. Not the extreme kind, but the kind that makes it just bearable for him to go to school and keep a part time job - and wanting girls hehe.",/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2021,Almost_Soldout,6," Atypical and the sister
","First 3 seasons were absolute must. S4 plot is so weak. Despite the fact, all of actors are doing great and Casey(sister) played genially, her character is driving the series to the wrong direction with its meaningless drama twist without actual drama.",/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2017,scythertitus,8," Relatable
","Reading some other reviews it seems like the representation of Autism is slightly skewed in this show, but in my opinion it successfully walked a fine line between being accurate and presenting something that everyone can relate to. Hopefully that helps people understand the condition, while also still having an entertaining show to watch.",/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2018,stephen-790,9," Great but... in Season 2.. Jennifer Jason Leigh is intolerable
","I'm hoping that in Season 3 her character is less annoying, if not I will have to stop watching.",/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2017,EuricSanti,10," Great story - performance and insight about life
","The first chapter got me. The others made me fell in love with the whole characters. Is about this complete family life with a kid whom has autism and how the experience of him in puberty, but the impact it creates on the whole family too. ",/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2017,amandakuech,9," Excellent depiction
","I don't understand why there are so many individuals stating the show exaggerates or skews autism symptoms. My son is on the spectrum, and in the autism works when you know one person with autism, you know one person with autism. That is why they call it a spectrum disorder. I feel this show did a great job of depicting Asperger's syndrome or high functioning autism. The actor is on point...lack of eye contact, sensory processing issues, blurting out inappropriate things, not being able to read others feelings, social struggles, his obsession with one subject, his outbursts...all the way to his food preferences. They also did a great job with how the sister is pushed aside and the marital struggles due to the stress of the autism. The fears the mother has reminds me of myself. I highly suggest this show; especially for families who have been blessed with an family member who is autistic. I hope it will be back for a second season.",/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2021,jordan2240,5," Count me among those not enjoying season 4
","As others have noted, seasons 1-3 were enjoyable, though I did feel myself losing some interest in season 3. Now, after watching 4 episodes of season 4, I'm not sure I'll finish it, and definitely not looking forward to a season 5 should there be one. Not only is the show focusing more on gender identity and sexual orientation, but Sam's story is becoming secondary. There are plenty of shows about the former that one can tune into if interested - this was supposed to be a show about adjusting to life as an autistic individual. In addition, what there is of Sam's story is becoming nonsensical, and I really can't take much more of Ms. Leigh's character's manner of speaking. Went from a 7 or 8 to a 5, and I suspect it will go even lower if I watch more of it.",/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2017,mogansage,10," Awesome
","This show was awesome! Can't wait until the next season (there better be one!!!!!!!!) Glad to see autism in the spotlight! Witty dialogue, amazing actors & actresses. Autism ranges from severe to mild... every case is different! This was a great series that starts a conversation (that has never been talked about). Instead of being critical (other reviewers) why don't we applaud the talent and ""pioneer-ism"" that went into this series to pave the way!!! Highly recommend, Netflix is really making great TV!",/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2018,aleminio,10," One of the best shows I've seen in a while
","I absolutely loved it and watched everything in 1 go. Even my girlfriend who can barely finish an episode of anything without stopping in the middle and continuing at some other time, has watched both seasons in one evening.
Which leads to my only disappointment from this show so far, and that's the fact that the seasons are quite short. ",/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2018,tarynkstilwell,10," So much heart, lots of laughs, and a bit of drama
","A Typical is one of my absolute favorite Orginial series from Netflix. It is funny and heartwarming, but also has the right amount of drama and feels so real. The cast is perfect and does a stellar job in each of their roles. If you want to watch high quality television on a show that has a unique lense of storytelling, check it out.",/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2021,jacekpoplawski,6," it started well...
","It's quite interesting show, topic is not very typical so there is something new here. However this is not 10/10.",/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2021,LuckyFour-LeafClover,7," Seasons 1-3 Great, Season 4 eeehhh
",I'm I agreement with a lot of the prior reviews. The 1st three seasons were good and kept me entertained.,/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2021,RealRosoy,7," Started pretty good going to end pretty bad
",Season 1-3 watchable. But god damn season 4 so boring why Casey getting so much Story she is not interesting at all. All that school stuff so damn annoying. SHOW US MORE OF SAMS LIFE!,/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2018,Kylkoog,10," I have autism and this show is so touching!
","I absolutely love this show! And as always Jennifer Jason Leigh is brilliant! Please renew for a third season. The show brings to light so many things (not just autism but all things in life) it really is the best show on Netflix, and quite frankly, a fresh breath of air in the world of tv shows. Bravo 5/5 Stars 2 thumbs up!",/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2021,matt_jacobs1,6," Such a shame.
","The first three seasons were incredible! I originally rated them as a 10. However, season 4 was a complete let down. It was almost as if the writers gave up and focused on the relationship of Casey and Izzy just to stay relevant.",/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2019,hoggdoctor,10," Beautiful character moments
",This show will make you cry in the best way possible - happy tears. It's depiction of love and friendship makes it extremely enjoyable !,/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2018,MasterJediLuke_,8," Really good show. Except for the mom.
","Let it be known that the mom character sucks. I HATE HATE HATE the mom character. I don't know if it's the actress or the way the character is written or both. I'm rewatching the first season and just fast forward through any scenes she's in. Isn't the show supposed to be about a boy on the spectrum? Instead it's about a boy on the spectrum and his stupid, annoying mother.",/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2018,ppa-02656,10," What was Netflix thinking?
",How can you make a show this amazing and only give us 10 30 minute episode's and leave us were you did. I NEED season 3 now. This is honestly one of the best shows I have seen in a long time. Thanks Netflix!,/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2019,kandy-kid,10," Season 3
",Amazing!!!! All 3 seasons amazing & I just hope Netflix does not cancel this series. It is perfect in everyway and a perfect show to watch with my teenagers. I don't want to give spoilers. But as the prior two seasons the third season did not disappoint at all!!!!,/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2019,j-snodgrass89,9," Emotionally Engaging
","Centred around a teenage boy on the spectrum, Atypical explores a range of characters each with their own idiosyncrasies and circumstance. With an Autistic sibling if my own, I can certainly relate to the situations within the series, or at least, understand how they got there. Atypical is a wonderful exploration of autism itself and how it can affect the people around those on the spectrum.",/review/rw3781642/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2017,zendatrim,10," Encore.....Bravo, exhilarating and brilliant I want more.
