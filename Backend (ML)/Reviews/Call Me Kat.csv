5 January 2021,rockymountaingirl05,9," Give it a chance. Mayim is hilarious
","People who give it 5 minutes shouldn't be allowed to rate it. It's not terrible it's cheesy and quirky and she's a dork, so? It's light hearted and fun. Mayim has the talent to pull it off and I liked it. But I am also a 39 year old single woman with a cat, so bear that in mind. It's silly fun, don't take it too seriously.",/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2021,cartoonnewsCP,6," Call Me Kat has potential despite a messy pilot
","While the pilot was mostly boring and unfunny, the second episode is a huge improvement. I hope it's not a one-off but I somewhat have hope in this show now. I wouldn't write it off so quickly. I think it has potential. Will be sticking around for a while.",/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2021,kimcoxmonm,1," Call me KaTastrophe
","A real disappointment. I've come to realize several new shows/movies that saturate all media with previews end up being,well,crap. Most I never see, but I like Mayim Bialik and Swoozie Kurtz, so I gave it a chance.",/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2021,jeffpeck5016,2," Separate us, please.
",I will be brief. This show eliminated the fourth wall. They should have kept it and added a fifth.,/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2021,JERIC0777,8," I've come to really like it
","To be fair, I didn't realize it was based on a British show, so I can see how people are complaining that it's not the same. I'll have to watch the original, but in the meantime, I really like the character of Kat. Admittingly, in the first ten minutes of the first episode, I was really annoyed with her turning to the camera seemingly every 10 seconds. After the first episode though, it's not as often and becomes more natural to the flow of the show.",/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2021,bobbiedabear-313-537996,8," Cute and funny, and look forward to see where it goes.
","People need to relax, this is Kat and not Miranda. Remember it's not an exact copy, and I'm glad they are bringing in some new material. It's the first show, and we have to get use to characters talking to the camera - the Brits have it down, and Mayim did a damn good job. We got some good chuckles from the show, and will love to see these characters develop. Congrats on your work.",/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2021,joshcranford,8," Great cast , a warm heart and laughs ...
","The format (where Kat talks to the audience intermittently throughout the show ) would be a bit more appreciated if you'd ever watched the original UK version of this show 'Miranda' ... which was a funny show ! This show hasn't quite reached that bar of well-timed British comedy and goofiness yet, but it definitely has potential to do so.",/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2021,catdaddyd,1," Nope
","I made it 5 minutes, Mayim doesn't have the charisma to talk to the camera. Who thought this was a good idea?",/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2021,rosalindsmith-85036,1," Just Awful
","It's an American version of Miranda series which was excellent and made in the UK, unfortunately this USA version is terrible not funny just a badly made copy. Watched the first episode couldn't watch anymore. Removing the 4th wall is only something Miranda can do and make it seem natural. Not watching any more of this USA series just going to rewatch Miranda now.",/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2021,Film_Diva,1," just doesn't work
","The main problem for me is the difference in the central character (Miranda v Kat). While Miranda has a lovely vulnerability and is completely believable ""spilling the beans"" to the audience, Kat just seems too confident and sort of snide to pull it off. It's a shame--I like Mayim, but this doesn't suit her at all.",/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2021,wildernessfamily-37922,1," Wow! Just awful!
","I was hoping all the reviews were wrong. OMG, I want my hour back. I tried 3 episodes. Who talks like that? And Kat needs a valium. There is over acting and there is just...well...Kat! The said part, it actually could be good, but new writer, and calm Kat down! And, get the f#$# out of Hollywood. The rest of us dont talk like that! Season 1 and.2 or the original Roseanne is how the real world is!",/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2021,Xavier_Stone,1," How anyone thought this would be funny is a mystery
","Mayim has her first big break out show on network television, and the first thing she does is spit water at the audience and then break the 4th wall. Then 10 seconds later spits out tea. This joke wasn't funny in the 60's.",/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2021,christv-84456,8," Just one episode
",Okay so I'll say first of all I.personally thought some of this show was funny I loved lessley jordan as always and kat was a beautiful face with a sweet heart I think people are being way to hard on this program and I will keep watching atleast for now anyway.update saw Thursdays episode and it was much better I laughed out loud,/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2021,pebsdad,3," No way to make this better...
","I always feel that, after only one episode viewed, there should be an opinion on a series just getting its start. But seriously, there is no way to make this better. It's not funny, the canned laughter is the worst it's ever been, and, just...ugh. To see at the beginning that this is based on BBC's Miranda is just lame. That show is funny and great because of Miranda Hart's brilliant physical comedy chops, which this show doesn't have. The only thing I enjoyed was the beautiful cats they managed to somehow get to sit still long enough while filming this bore. It is, however, always nice to see Leslie Jordan getting to play himself once again (no shade...he is a delight).",/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2021,naomirose-83781,," Has potential...
","I wanted to write a review as there are a ton of bad reviews. I think the strongest part of the pilot episode was the last quarter of it, where Mayim was being less of a ""Miranda"" goofy and more of a goofy that fits her. I think it will find its stride over time. Not the strongest pilot, starts slow, but I do want to see what happens.",/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2021,Ed-Shullivan,3," What's that bad smell?
",I will tell you what it is. It's another stinker of a show that they advertised in advance to ad nauseum and it turns out that Call Me KaT is a real bore of what they expect to pass for a Comedy series?. Add insult to injury they also pipe in that obnoxious canned laughter continuously which is supposed to be our clue to laugh along. Laugh along at what? Not funny. Not interesting. A pure stinkeroo.,/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2021,MiketheWhistle,1," Dumpster Fire
","I'm sorry but the show is horrible. I forced myself to make it thru the entire pilot, but it was horrible. I didn't know it was a take off of a Brit show as it reminded me a bit of Herman's Head without the 4 actors that were in his head.",/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2021,ocean_breeze1ca,10," HOPING
","That this show improves as I really like Mayim, but the script needs to be better written and not so forced and I wish there was the canned laughter. I will keep watching and hope it gets better.",/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2021,okdasbooter,6," Miranda
","Just caught the first episode. I love Mayim. And the show is decent, but it's not as charming as the UK show it's trying to mirror called Miranda.",/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2021,natbro96,2," Complete waste of time
","I was looking forward to this it sounded like it would be funny and I really like Leslie Jordan.
It was terrible and not funny. The writers have no idea of funny.
Disappointing and why did she have to talk at the viewers? Might have been ok if what she was saying was actually funny",/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2021,hullsredneck,10," Cute & Funny
","I love this show! It's funny, the characters are great and I love the way it's set up. I see a lot of reviews of people being thrown off with Mayim addressing the camera and it's weird to see her like this. I felt the same way when it first started but I decided to get over myself and I'm so glad I did! I wish more people would. They are missing out in a good show. Oh and stop comparing it to the British show counterpart. Yes the idea came from it but it's its own show and maybe if you stopped comparing you'd like this one! Give it a try!",/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2021,daniellemoran-97796,10," Give it time
","I gave this show a 10 because of how quickly the characters and plot developed over just a few episodes. Mayim Bialik is very talented actress and singer. She is slowly bringing the show to life with Kat's emotional growth. She doesn't break the fourth wall as often as she did in the very beginning which helps the show a lot. I've never seen the original, but I think that makes my review less bias than some of the other reviews below. I understand that we live in a world of instant gratification, but some of the best shows started out cringe-worthy including Seinfeld, Friends, The Office, etc. I am not comparing this show to them. I'm simply giving an example of shows that were slow-starters and evolved significantly. Greatness takes time and patience.",/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2021,wbsimsjr-32405,8," Good Show, hold some promise
","Having been a fan of Miranda Hart and her show Miranda.. I'd have to sorta agree with some of the other comments, but it's not that bad. I will be abck to watch the show grow into its own.. I did laugh even at some of the things that were lifted from Miranda.
I'd have to say that with the attempts at transitioning Britcoms to American audiences is a somewhat antiquated business ideal.. We watch Britcoms because our sitcoms lack that certain something.. In the original Miranda, everyone had a bit of a shtick, from her bestie, her Mom (Patricia Hodge is fantastic!), Gary and all the other cast members. Miranda bounced her actions/reactions and talking to the cam on those situations...
Big Bang writers might have been great at TBBT, but they obviously didn't watch the original to see the chemistry and nuances of the shows appeal.. Fire the writers, work on chemistry and this could be a great run!",/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2021,lambiepie-2,7," Does Not Deserve the 'Bad' Reviews.
","I find this show delightful, and it's about time to have something like a throwback of all the old sit-coms, and not every five minutes a fart joke, a weight joke, a political joke, etc. This is just, nice. The idea is very comedic, an older age, well educated woman, figures she'll never get married so takes her parents money gives up everything to run..a cat cafe?!?",/review/rw6520850/?ref_=tt_urv
