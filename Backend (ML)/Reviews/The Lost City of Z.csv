12 February 2022,aarpcats,6," Get me preggo, baby.
","When I read that one of my fellow reviewers called this a ""documentary,"" I spent a few minutes staring out the window to mourn the death of a country so overrun with craziness that young people can no longer distinguish ""reality"" from ""satire."" I didn't blame the person who wrote the review. I blamed a country so out of its mind that it elected a president who tried to destroy documents by flushing them down the toilet while living in a White House with fourteen fireplaces.",/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2022,midnitepantera,7," Surprisingly Better than I thought it would be. ;D
","Seth Rogan is hilarious in this. And I thought the actors playing Pam and Tommy did a pretty decent job. I feel bad for Pam, she didn't deserve this revenge that Tommy's A-hole personality and ripping off contractors brought down on her.",/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2022,gracynmartin,," Too Morally Torn to rate
","I liked the show and part of me wants to rate it highly because Sebastian Stan and Lily James did a spectacular job in their roles and I think it was a good lesson to people on the trauma and invasion of privacy Tommy Lee and especially Pamela went through. It also showed how awful, exploitive, and plain unhelpful the world was in response to it when they should have been appalled and supportive. BUT despite how good I felt the show was I did not realize until afterwards when I decided to look up how accurate the events were when I learned that Pamela Anderson never gave consent for this to be made. Tommy Lee gave his but he wasn't even asked for it until after it's creation so they probably would have released it consent or no. That's honestly messed up and makes them no better than the people that exploited the couple in the past. For it to be a show about consent they should have had the consent of the two people it's about. Had I known prior, I would have felt obligated not to watch it. That being said, I did feel the show did a good job of empathizing Pamela and Tommy Lee's situation in a way that speaks for many who have found themselves in similar ordeals.",/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv

","Lily James was always underrated, she has proven now that she can take on much more versatile roles. She showed that she can act as Pamela Anderson. Hope she gets more mainstream and bigger roles now.",/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2022,JonanthanNewOrleans,9," Loving it
","It's unpretentious , fast paced , funny, full of energy and the guy Tommy is just insane in a fun way.",/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2022,FeastMode,7," Fun and interesting
","I was 10 years old during the events of this series. I eventually became aware of the tape, but I knew almost nothing of the details surrounding it. And it's way more interesting than I expected, which is why I had such a good time with this series.",/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2022,TheTruthofItIs,8," Surprisingly engaging tale of this moment in history
","""Pam & Tommy"" (S00, 8-eps, 45-min, Hulu) is a pretty fascinating telling of this moment in history. It's not just about their sexcapades, it's about the 90s, the early days of the internet, about their energetic/frenetic relationship, the mercurial/immature nature of Tommy against Pam's more mature/adult nature. It's also about the seedy business of porn in the early days of the internet. It's surprisingly engaging as you'll want to watch each ep in quick succession.",/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2022,ivantheeditor,10," The internet trolls are way too critical!!
","Wow.... people are seriously so spoiled these days. The show is great! The actors are great! The story is great. The cinematography, the writing, the editing... everything is great. I don't know what people want these days. Everyone has completely unrealistic expectations and the second they're not 110% met they start complaining. We didn't have shows like this 20 years ago. We had slow boring crap. And leave Seth Rogen alone. I'm not a fan of him either but he's so freaking good in this! And don't get me started on Pamela... this little lady absolutely nailed it!! Is it EXACTLY 210% like Pamela Anderson? No. It's a different person playing Pamela Anderson. Duh.",/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2022,Turanic,7," Could have been boring af, it isn't
","The story is told in a perspective of multiple characters which already makes it an unexpected treat... You wonder if it's worth watching? I thought I'd regret ,but it's more than just the story of Pam and Tommy, it's a somewhat great portrayal of the 90's era, when every teenager wanted a girlfriend similar to Pam and Pam is that Barbie girl prototype many girls aimed to be well at least physically ... Also this show is full of great 90's songs and a moral to treat people that work for you with respect, because Karma is a bit## ...",/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2022,wvj3,9," I don't understand the bad reviews
",I honestly don't understand the bad reviews. I think this is great. Honestly as someone who grew up when the sex tape was a huge thing it's interesting to find out the story behind it. The acting is on point and honestly if you didn't know better you think Lily and Sabastian were the real deal.,/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2022,JohnFilmfreak,4," Something is very off about this show.
","First of all, even though they managed to make the actors look quite similar to the real people, the way they perform is always a tiny bit tongue in cheek, so that you never quite forget they're acting. This is especially true for the guy playing Tommy, who looks more like a kid in a candy store, than a heavy metal rocker.",/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2022,Jac23443,7," Quickly Falls Off The Rails
","This show really started off strong, had no issue being raunchy with some gratuitous display of nudity and sex and craziness. But right off the bat, after the third episode, it was all too fairy tale like Tommy Lee wasn't a piece of garbage in reality whose relationship with Pam was littered with unfortunate events, and Anderson's worst problem was the male patriarchy who kept her career from flourishing past sex symbol status.",/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2022,lisafordeay,7," Seen a few episodes so far and boy it was good
",Pam and Tommy is a 2022 8 part mini series starring Lily James(Cinderella) and Sebastain Stan(Captain America:Winter Solider)as the controversy couple Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee who met and married 96 hours back in 1995. The first episode is about a carpenter who is doing up Tommy Lee's mansion only to get fired and seek revenge as he stumbles on a homemade video containing Pamela and Tommy having sex(which was sold online back in 1995). The second episode is a flashback video of when Tommy Lee meets Pamela Anderson and gets so infatuated with her.,/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2022,Kingslaay,7," Not a bad mini-series
","I'm glad I gave Pam & Tommy a go. Lily James and Sebastian Stan hit their performances out of the park, they look and sound like the real Tommy and Pamela. Seth Rogen is a great addition as well. This series gave an interesting look into the sad, humorous and dramatic marriage of two celebrities. I was very young during these actual events so enjoyed seeing a dramatization of these events much later. Sad how a private tape could adversely affect both their lives, Pam wanted to be a real actress and not an object. Tommy came across as a buffoon whose heyday was behind him, washed out rich Rockstar.",/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2022,dan-abbot,2," Misses the mark
","I was expecting something similar to ""I, Tonya"" - good character development and a look into privacy issues. Too bad it's unnecessarily crude, and Pamela Anderson is portrayed as a 2-dimensional sweet/na√Øve party animal that only wants to be a mother. In real life, she (like every other person) is more complicated and talks more confidently - involved in a lot of charities, politics and animal rights. Not only that, there's too much time spent on Rand and the porn industry, which takes away from the 2 human beings at the center of the privacy issues. That's why the story doesn't work. It's no wonder Anderson didn't want to have anything to do with this show.",/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2022,hendersonandrew-61451,6," Started well but tailed off big time
","I thought the first episode was really cool and was excited for the rest. Then in ep 2 Tommy has a conversation with his penis and I started to change my mind. This show was lame. Would have been awesome if it was condensed to 5-6 episodes as there are long stretches where nothing happens. The guy playing Tommy Lee is super annoying but it's not his fault, Tommy Lee is an annoying guy and in that area he nailed it. Seth Rogen is cool and I am a massive Nick Offerman fan so was disappointed his character doesn't get that much screen time. 6/10, could have been way better.",/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2022,lineart-12973,," Tommy is trash
","If this is anything close to what this guy is all about or behaved... From the beginning robbing his contractors, flashing his rifles around, drug-pushing, violent addict. Anderson never sanctioned this film and we can see why. What an insult, but she had every opportunity to get this freak out of her life. What a fool she was. She had a great career otherwise and I love her work. Her life is normal now. But I had no idea Tommy was such an awful person. Glad I hated his music.",/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2022,em-gliss,1," Wow this is bad
",Not sure why people are giving this such a high rating. It's filled with so much cringe and cheesiness that I could barely get two episodes in. I was embarrassed for the actors. I feel like they seriously missed the mark. Everyone is praising Stan and Lily for their portrayals. Why? They acted more like cartoon characters than actual Pam and Tommy. A little too corny for me. Especially when Stan has a conversation with his penis. Seriously?????,/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2022,d_penn,3," Pam&Tommy
","Follows the story of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee's relationship, going back to their whirlwind romance that started with them marrying after only knowing each other for 96 hours in 1995. A brief overview of just how the sex tape played out. It was just ok, actually a little underneath it.",/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2022,eamonnh-89469,1," Maybe
","Well given how this was made without the permission of Pamela Anderson, well then maybe Pamela should take a page off of ms james book and make a biopic of her recent life, where she slept with a married man knowing he also has kids and see how she likes it.",/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2022,abeyeast,1," Not the justice Pam deserves
","The makeup/costume department deserve mad props, but at the end of the day I'm just not sure we needed a series on this story. Stan does well , however ""the dirt"" on Netflix was probably the better adaptation of Lee and I'm just not sure we needed more of this guy. Still shocked we watched a scene where his penis talks to him. Like many series these days this one is trying to romanticize a dysfunctional relationship. It also portrays Pam as a total bimbo, not saying she's Stephen fry in real life but she doesn't give me any main character energy in this series. Not a total disaster but overall pretty forgettable, and feels pointless so far.",/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2022,julieshotmail,7," Much better than I expected
","On the surface ""Pam & Tammy"" gives the first impression of trash TV, but as you watch the beginnings of episode 1 you realize that this show is quite well-produced. Seth Rogen is a nice touch as the carpenter. But the clear winners here are the masterful impersonations of Pam and Tommy through the acting chops of Lily James and Sebastian Stan, served by a very talented makeup and costume team. British actress Lily James has perfected Pamela Anderson's mannerisms and subtle expressions. You really think it's Pamela. And Sebastian Stan exudes confidence in his portrayal of obnoxious Tommy Lee. The scenes flow well, introducing many other quirky characters, keeping you glued wondering the ultimate fate of that tape. Led by a strong first episode, the quality of subsequent episodes does dwindle slightly, with episodes 6 and 7 a bit disjointed with a mismatched pace. Thankfully, the series finishes with a solid final episode and even throws in a moral lesson for the viewer to mull, which is refreshingly a far cry from trash TV.",/review/rw7894857/?ref_=tt_urv
