19 May 2009,littlemartinarocena,9," Anthony Minghella's Heart and Mind
","It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see ""The English Patient"" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In ""The Talented Mr Ripley"" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In ""Breaking And Entering"" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in ""The English Patient"", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a ""Minghellian"" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.",/review/rw0995300/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2002,jhclues,10," A Magnificent Motion Picture
","In a style reminiscent of the best of David Lean, this romantic love story sweeps across the screen with epic proportions equal to the vast desert regions against which it is set.  It's a film which purports that one does not choose love, but rather that it's love that does the choosing, regardless of who, where or when; and furthermore, that it's a matter of the heart often contingent upon prevailing conditions and circumstances.  And thus is the situation in `The English Patient,' directed by Anthony Minghella, the story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most inopportune of places and times, proving that when it is predestined, love will find a way.",/review/rw0995300/?ref_=tt_urv

","Anthony Minghella's 'The English Patient' is a film that takes us back to the golden years of Hollywood. It is grand and impressive in scale, and yet so heartbreakingly intimate in its portrayal of human love and suffering. At the 1997 Academy Awards, the film owned the night, taking home nine awards from twelve nominations, the most decisive cleansweep since Bernardo Bertolucci's 'The Last Emperor' in 1988. Based on Canadian author Michael Ondaatje's 1992 Booker Prize-winning novel of the same name, 'The English Patient' is a touching meditation on life, love and loss, tracing the history of a critically-burnt man in the aftermath of World War Two.",/review/rw0995300/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2007,inkblot11,10," One of the greatest achievements in all of cinema, peerlessly beautiful
","Count Laszlo (Ralph Fiennes) has just been transferred to a hospital in Italy during World War II. He is horrifically burned from an ambush. His nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche) tends to him, body and mind, for she fears, quite rightly, that he may be a very troubled soul. In the course of his care, the Count starts to tell Hana of his recent past. It seems he worked in a government capacity in Africa, where he met a beautiful married lady named Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Although they tried to avoid each other, they fell in love. After a brief affair, Katherine called it quits, leaving the Count desolate. Even so, the two would meet again, under heart-wrenching circumstances. Meanwhile, Hana herself falls for a Sihk man in the British bomb squad. Yet, the war is raging relentlessly. Can love exist when the world is in turmoil? This is a tremendous film, based on an equally fine but complex novel. The plot has many story lines that are woven together beautifully, each of them poignant beyond description. The script itself is elegant and contains many memorable lines. Fiennes is magnificent, both as the burn victim and as the man who thought love was a myth. Scott Thomas is also quite fine as the woman who fights against her passions. As for Binoche, she richly deserved the Oscar that she was presented, as her nurse is a shining example of hope in a hopeless situation. The scenery is utterly gorgeous, as are the costumes, the direction, and the production. If you have missed out on viewing this film, rectify that soon, very soon. The English Patient will remain one of the greatest achievements in film for centuries to come.",/review/rw0995300/?ref_=tt_urv

","I personally have never understood the backlash The English Patient gets. I can understand why it might try someone's patience, as the pace is very slow and perhaps purposefully so and the film is very long at over two-and-a-half hours, but I do think it is unfair that there are those who consider one of the worst Best Picture winners(I personally think Crash, Cimarron, Braveheart and The Hurt Locker are worse, I have never understood the hate for Shakespeare in Love either as in my opinion that's better than the movie-Saving Private Ryan- that almost everyone says should have beat it).

","Sometimes I just don't get it with the ratings of the IMDb. I'm writing this review because I'm shocked to see this film at a 7.3 rating. This is so ridiculous. It is really hard to point out a film which is better told, better crafted, having a more deeply love-story and such a overall fascinating aura. I do understand that everything is a question of taste but this masterpiece is so full of beauty and drama that you simply can not rate it under 8. If you do not like it so much = 8 , if you like it = 9 and if you love it's pure beauty = 10 And now go and watch this movie.

","'The English Patient' can rightly be compared to the films of David Lean, whose sweeping epics such as 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'Bridge on the River Kwai' must have inspired the director Anthony Minghella. The film is beautifully photographed, and like 'Lawrence', is set in Northern Africa, but during the second world war.  The story is complex, but it boils down to a forbidden love between an opinionated and often difficult archeologist played by Ralph Fiennes and a married woman played by Kristin Scott Thomas.",/review/rw0995300/?ref_=tt_urv

","One of the most charming and, for me at least, the most powerful elements of Anthony Minghella's enthralling Best Picture-winner ""The English Patient"" is that, in the mid 90s, when Hollywood was in the initial stage of having lost its nerve for grand new projects, a film was created that brought back traces—very powerful traces—of the sweeping, wonderful majesty that crafted movies such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) and ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956). ""The English Patient"" contains very much of what made those films so powerful. It has that glorious feeling, a stretched running time that hardly seems long at all, and fascinating characters with pasts and stories.",/review/rw0995300/?ref_=tt_urv

","TEP is like a long cool drink of water after crawling across the Sahara to classic film buffs who have been too long deprived of that certain cinematic magic!  Not only is it beautifully photographed, but the characters are perfectly portrayed.  If you're looking for the film to be a mirror of the book, you will be seriously disappointed.  Instead, it is an excellent ""companion"" to the book, and I think that is what Anthony Minghella intended.  Ralph Fiennes is probably the most beautiful man in the world; not to mention a brilliant actor.  Juliette Binoche is the posterchild for vulnerability and childlike enthusiasm.  And, of course, I'll go see any film in which Kristin Scott Thomas is featured.  She simply must be THE best actress since the likes of Deborah Kerr.

","I did give this film several shots. I just couldn't like it, but I really tried. The cinematography I enjoyed with all viewings, especially the scenes in which they flew over beautiful sand dunes. However, midway through the story it bogs down in this adulterous love affair between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas. It picks ups slightly, but never really recovered. In both viewings, I wound up counting down the time left in the film. It's basically a woman's movie.",/review/rw0995300/?ref_=tt_urv

","I like this movie above all others. It is ""multi-layered""; there is so much to see and appreciate. Every viewing brings a new appreciation of the story-line, the plot and the characters. Faultlessly acted and extremely enjoyable if you take the time to watch it and appreciate it. I love the interaction between the players; the subtle relationships; the period atmosphere. Ralph Fiennes is perfectly cast as the brooding lover and Geoffrey the wronged husband is beautifully underplayed by Colin Firth. The scene in the sand storm where Catherine & El-masy are discussing the different types of sand storms is one of the high-lights of the film and where the affair really starts. The other relationship between Hanna & El-masy is yet another ""layer"" of the movie which is totally enchanting (and heart-rending). A worthy winner of so many awards.",/review/rw0995300/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2020,dr_clarke_2,9," Anthony Minghella's masterpiece
","The English Patient has variously been described as a war film and a romance; it is perhaps best described however as a tragedy. Adapted by writer and director Anthony Minghella from Michael Ondaatje's novel of the same name, it tells the story a mysterious disfigured man being nursed in an abandoned villa at the tail end of World War Two, and gradually unpicks his past and how he came to be injured.
The English Patient is a stately, elegant film, with a carefully written, elegant script. The characterisation is convincing, from the scarred and dying protagonist Almásy who recounts the doomed love affair that culminated in his in injuries, through his nurse Hana, to bomb disposal expert Kip and pretty much everyone else in the movie. The plot unfolds via a non-linear narrative that alternates between scenes set in the story's present and flashbacks as Hana and visiting Canadian Caravaggio gradually learn the truth about Almásy. The story's tragedy lies in the ill-fated love affair between charismatic but aloof explorer and archaeologist Almásy and the married Katharine Clifton, both characters the picture of upper class restraint in the face of growing mutual attraction. Their happiness proves all too brief, as Katherine's husband's pain and jealousy result in her death, and the same series of events eventually lead to Almásy
Interwoven with the story of Almásy and Katherine are other subplots, as we discover what happened to Caravaggio's absent thumbs, and as Hana falls in love with Kip. If there's a problem with The English Patient is that although all of the characters and their stories are compellingly written, the film is quite slow at times and the additional plot threads feel like padding. Nevertheless, the film is largely successful and the horrors of war provide a striking and often horribly well realised backdrop, with some truly unpleasant scenes such as Caravaggio having his thumbs cut off by sadistic Nazi torturers. The scene of Kip disarming the bomb in the pit is incredibly tense: just when it seems it will explode, he successfully renders it harmless, but the scene is juxtaposed with the subsequent death of Sergeant Hardy which is realistically out of the blue and meaningless.
Minghella's direction results in a handsome film, in no small part to the gorgeous location filming, which John Seale's cinematography exploits to full effect. Scenes such as the sandstorm and the German invasion are impressively staged, whilst the make-up used for the hideously wounded Almásy has aged well. The casting is perfect: Ralph Fiennes completely immerses himself in the role of Almásy, and Kristin Scott Thomas, Willem Dafoe, Juliette Binoche and Naveen Andrews are just as well cast, with strong support provided from the likes of Colin Firth and Kevin Whately. All of the actors give naturalistic performances, which make the tragic pattern of their lives all the more potent (notably, every character of note loses somebody dear to them, even those characters who get an otherwise happy ending). The ending, which sees Almásy convince Hana to commit euthanasia, is poignant rather than mawkish and that's partly due to the acting as well to Minghella's screenplay.
Walter Murch's careful editing is crucial to the success of the film's complex plot, and it is the fact that it reveals the answers to the questions posed by the screenplay a bit at a time that helps to drive the narrative and maintain the audience's interest. The English Patient could perhaps have been a little leaner and a little shorter, but as it stands its still a very impressive piece of work and arguably the highpoint of the late Minghella's well-respected career.",/review/rw0995300/?ref_=tt_urv

6 December 2008,mnpollio,2," Odious tedium
","More than a decade after enduring this atrocity, I am still at a loss to determine what exactly compelled viewers (not to mention the Academy Awards) to lavish this uninspiring vapid mess with such over-the-top praise. There are so many things inherently wrong with the film that it becomes difficult to isolate which one of them is the most responsible for the film's implosion. Based on a popular novel - the reading of which would probably take less time than enduring the film - The English Patient centers on an mysterious count hideously disfigured by burns who victimizes his nurse (and the viewer) with the tale of ill-fated romance that left him physically and emotionally scarred. The film has its moments of beauty, but sweeping desert scenes are a dime a dozen in cinema and hardly earn this film's heralded descriptions of ""sweeping"" ""majestic"" and ""grand"". The film's two biggest problems are its length and its leads. The core story is relatively simple, but is so loaded up with pointless subplots and completely unnecessary extraneous characters that the film literally screeches to a halt shortly out of the starting gate. Willem Dafoe shows up late in the film to overact shamelessly and provide a narrative function that could just as easily have been satisfied by the nurse in a fraction of the time. Meanwhile, Colin Firth, whose character sets the film into motion as part of the central love triangle, is barely given a nod worth of screen time. Director Anthony Minghella seems to have no knowledge of the basics of pace, character development or how to emotionally involve his audience. A truly compelling romance requires that the central pairing crackle and draw the viewer into their emotions, whether the romance is illicit, young love or mature. Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott-Thomas are both singularly fine actors, but both share a similar acting style in that they are often restrained and emotionally aloof. The writing and dialog between them leaves the viewer unable to tell whether their characters are in love or merely in lust - but either way the actors generate zero chemistry between each other. Both come across as cold, selfish, uninteresting and emotionally inaccessible - leaving a glacial dead zone smack in the center of the film. To somewhat alleviate that, we get a romantic subplot between the nurse and a Sikh bomb expert that has a bit more emotion, but placing the emotional burden of the film on two supporting characters is highly unfair and completely ineffective. Juliette Binoche, as the nurse, acts pretty much like your standard super-model, leaving what little sympathy is generated to come from Naveen Andrews appealing work. By the time the film inexcusably limps towards its unforgivable third hour, most viewers will actually be rooting for the English Patient to do away with himself and regret that he had not done it a good 90 minutes earlier. Simply dreadful pretentious piffle.",/review/rw0995300/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2016,oOoBarracuda,10," ""I really ought to drag myself outside, but then there'd be the sun.""
","The English Patient is proof that films should be judged on merit and content alone, rather than on how the public perceives them. I feel very much the same about this film as I do about How Green Was My Valley; audiences love to trash that film because it beat out Citizen Kane for Best Picture in 1941. Citizen Kane was an astounding movie; so much about knowledge about filmmaking was expressed through that film that directors still use today. Citizen Kane is often touted as the best movie of all time and constantly listed as prominent actor and director's favorite films, providing a source of inspiration. As good as Citizen Kane is, and I agree that it's phenomenal, so is How Green Was My Valley. I have exactly this same kinship to The English Patient. I have heard many people express disdain for this film for a variety of reasons, namely, though, for beating Fargo for best picture in 1996. I have yet to see Fargo, however, The English Patient starring Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, and Kristin Scott Thomas was a sensational film directed by Anthony Minghella, and more than deserving of every award it received from the Academy.",/review/rw0995300/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'll never forget the shot of the silver biplane flying over the golden desert, with Count Almasy in the back seat and the corpse of his beloved, Mrs. Clifton, up forward. Indeed, ""the heart is an organ of fire,"" and these are its ashes. By interweaving the love story with history from Herodotus to the atrocities of WW II, it provides a mythic, legendary backdrop to a tale of lovers, whose intense passion, like that of Romeo and Juliet or Orpheus and Eurydice, leads them to disregard the world around them. From the moment that they dive into the Cave of Swimmers, we are reminded of the fate which is common to us all. The movie was perfectly cast and the performances are first rate.

4 February 2010,Hitchcoc,10," Totally Captivating
","I have had this film on my radar since it won the Oscar lo these many years. It is described as romantic drama and the sound of it turned me off. Now that I've seen it, I know why it was so highly thought of. Those who criticize it seem to have two axes to grind. It's too long and the characters are unlikeable. I never thought for a moment that the film was too long; I didn't even notice the length. As for the characters, they are what they are, incredibly complex. Throw people into the mess of war and they don't behave ""properly."" This is a movie about undying love and the reality of conflict. We continue to fight wars despite the toll they produce. Human beings aren't satisfied with being the chosen species, they have to go about taking that from others. I know this sounds simplistic. Of course, wars need to be fought, but the price is great. Yes the main characters are selfish and passionate and don't look back very well. People to cheat and divorce and act on baser instincts, but the movie lets us know why their motives are. Sometimes I think that people would like a cotton candy presentation of life. Well, that's not art. Art gets at the guts of what we are and presents it to us, even if we don't like it. I thought Fiennes character was at times a total ass. He took and didn't give back. He catalogued his life inside a copy of Herodotus, creating a scrapbook of his existence. There are also our peripheral characters. Kip and Hana who are also victims of war, and the Dafoe character who hasn't lost as much but is marked for life. Everyone grows, even in the faith of death, and the spirit lives on. This is one marvelous film.",/review/rw0995300/?ref_=tt_urv
