10 March 2017,marcosaguado,10," Jane and Banche in the real world.
","Why was I thinking that it couldn't work? Maybe because it never does. But ""Bette and Joan"" present us with that always welcome exception. The introduction of this two icons has sharpness and shine. Both walking a very tight rope. Joan with desperation, Bette with defiance. It is a terrific treat to see Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon going for the real centers rather than the caricature. Alfred Molina is priceless as Robert Aldrich and Stanley Tucci reinvents Jack Warner to a delightful perfection. The late entrance of Joan/Jessica at the theater where Bette/Susan is playing in The Night Of The Iguana is one of my favorite film moments of the young 2017 season. Now, needles to say, I can't wait for the next chapter.",/review/rw3692633/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2017,claudiaeilcinema,9," Not about hate but about pain
","Hurrah for Ryan Murphy. He avoided the obvious trap of super camp. This human tragedy is told without winks and secret giggles. It is a tragedy no matter how funny. Two mega stars of its day drowning in personal pettiness and fear. Now with the benefit of hindsight and with the help of their daughters memoirs we know that fame and fortune is not the happy place most people imagine. Jessica Lange's Joan filled me with sadness, something Joan, the actress, could never do. Susan Sarandon's Bette made me want to shake her like she did Miriam Hopkins in ""Old Acquaintance"". Alfred Molina as Robert Aldrich deserves a mention all his own. Brilliant!",/review/rw3692633/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2017,ggallegosgroupuk,10," An Ending To Cherish
","Superb. The dream, the wish, the thought. Sitting at a table face to face to say, I'm sorry. Thank you to Ryan Murphy and everyone concerned. Jessica Lange gives a performance that will live for ever, so does Susan Sarandon, in the last episode, her Bette Davis is there, totally, absolutely, chillingly there. What a thrill! Jessica Lange has five or six moments that I think will remain as ""acting"" landmarks. Alfred Molina's Robert Aldrich, devastating, brilliant! And Jack Warner's Stanley Tucci, a repellent delight. Fabulous eight episodes, eight! Enough to keep us wishing for more.",/review/rw3692633/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2017,phd_travel,9," Superb acting and fascinating story
","The acting is superb. Susan Sarandon - perennially youthful acts and talks like Bette Davis. Jessica Lange is just as convincing as Joan Crawford. Ryan Murphy has really taken a fascinating subject and created a pretty long series that isn't boring for a second. Good support from Alfred Molina as the director, Stanley Tucci as Jack Warner, Judy Davis as Hedda Hopper and Kiernan Shipka of Mad Men as Bette's daughter. Who knew the behind the scenes of making a movie could be so interesting. Looked forward to every episode.",/review/rw3692633/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2017,jpm-onfocus,10," Joan and Jessica, Bette and Susan
","Now already on episode 3 I can say without a doubt. ""Feud"" is totally addictive. The writing, the direction, costumes and production design, it all works beautifully, satisfying those who knew nothing about the story and those of us who knew a great deal. The biggest surprise, however is the Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon's performances that puts everything into a level way above, camp and/or caricature. Their performances are serious, profound, all consuming. Two modern stars throw themselves into the emotional investigation of two stars from the past and the results are, let me say it, extraordinary. I'm looking at Joan Crawford through an entirely new perspective. Jessica Lange has humanized her without embellishing her and Susan Sarandon plays with Bette Davis's contradictions making them crystal clear even finding a sort of justification for them. I saw the 3rd episode ""Mommie Dearest"" twice in a row. That's how riveted I was and still am. Let me also mention Alfred Molina as Robert Aldrich. Sensational.",/review/rw3692633/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2017,paulfairbanksusa,10," An The Winner Is....a classic
","The whole series so far is a rewarding surprise. No camp caricature here but a serious, incisive portrayal of two iconic characters. Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon create her characters based on Joan Crawford and Bette Davis with such virtuosity that every new episode allow us to go deeper without ever turning into parody. Their reality is parody enough. But what touches me is that Lange and Sarandon, taking our preconceptions into account, inspire us to look at this two women as human beings. My admiration also to Alfred Molina - Robert Aldrich? Wow! Absolute perfection. On the latest episode ""And The Winner Is..."" Two extraordinary moments: Geraldine Page (A superb Sarah Paulson) taking Crawford's call and surrendering to her request because ""She needs it"" or Anne Bancroft (a wonderful Serinda Swan) receiving Crawford in her dressing room. Bancroft and Page understand Crawford's agony even from a distance. Compassion at last. I'm enjoying Feud with all my senses. Thank you Ryan Murphy and everyone involved.",/review/rw3692633/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2017,willandthomas-picturehou,9," The Working Women Of La La Land
","Ryan Murphy managed the virtually impossible. Finding a tone and the tone has to do with the humanity of this Hollywood gargoyles. I wonder if young Joan and Bette knew where they were heading. Those women that their daughters wrote about, were they who they were or who they became. Jessica Lange throws a light on Joan Crawford that made me, already, re-think her myth. Her fear is actually tangible. Great, great performance. Susan Sarandon captures Davis's temperament and allow us a glimpse into the contradictory nature of the woman. Brilliant, succinct observation - when she throws herself into the role of wife and mother, she was thoroughly miscast. Alfred Molina is superb as Robert Aldrich and Stanley Tucci is terrific as Jack ""I show you my hemorrhoids"" Warner. I can't wait for the next episode.",/review/rw3692633/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2017,fredschaefer-406-623204,9," So much better then I thought it would be.
","This show was nothing like I thought it would be, for when I originally read that Ryan Murphy would be making a mini-series built around the legendary feud between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford that raged during the making of WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE, I figured this would be a camp fest where Susan Sarandon and Jessica Lange would claw at each other while doing bad imitations of these icons. Before the first episode was half over, I realized my complete error, as FEUD: BETTE AND JOAN is heartbreaking story of manipulation, ageism, ingratitude, and most of all, the terrible fear of being cast aside and being unwanted and unneeded. It's the story of two formidable women who had built a career in the public spotlight and desperately wanted to hold on to it.",/review/rw3692633/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2017,moonspinner55,8," ""I'll stop worrying about how I look when they dip me in Formaldehyde.""
","Eight-part cable series from super-producer Ryan Murphy delineates the long-running Hollywood rivalry between Oscar-winning actresses Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, culminating with their teaming for two pictures, 1962's ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane"" and 1964's ""Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte"", the latter of which was finished without Crawford (Olivia de Havilland stepped in after ""producer"" Bette ran Joan off). Altogether amazing recreation of a by-gone era...not quite what we now think of as classic Hollywood, but rather a Tinsel Town in decline, feeding off itself and its denizens. Material which might have slipped into caricature becomes observant, acerbic and surprisingly touching here, under the service of several different writers and directors. By showing the human side of an older Crawford (Jessica Lange) and Davis (Susan Sarandon), we see the hidden, hurting heart of Hollywood, a town not known for having or showing sympathy to aging actresses. The first two episodes of the series are entertaining if a bit wobbly--neither Lange nor Sarandon particularly sounds nor resembles the ladies they are portraying, and the supporting cast, too, works to find their footing--but these are nitpicks in what is essentially a loving (and lovingly, meticulously designed) tribute to the Hollywood icons. The padding for length is exposed on occasion, but this duet keeps getting better and better. By the grand finale, both Lange and Sarandon are performing at the top of their craft (initially, one may hope for impersonations, but what we eventually get from the ladies is far richer). In an eerie, evocative dream sequence near the end, all the feelings of pain and loss and triumph and regret come full circle. These women were survivors, battle-scarred veterans, two tough broads--but not so tough that they didn't privately feel the pain of the passing years, and how a possible friendship was trampled over in the need for success and respect.",/review/rw3692633/?ref_=tt_urv

20 March 2017,blanbrn,9," A wonderful take on the real life feud between two legends that's moved along with envy, sexism, and the fact of aging.
","""FX"" and director Ryan Murphy has done it again as a real life drama has been brought to the screen and it brings light on the issue all while having drama, black heart comedy, and envy with age and sexism closing everything up! Many film fans don't know a lot about Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, only some remember their 1962 classic suspense horror film ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane"" and the tales and stories written of the on screen drama and fights that went with the picture, well this series ""Feud"" captures those hot and wicked moments just fine. Both actresses Bette Davis(Susan Sarandon)and Joan Crawford(Jessica Lange)are on the downside of their famous and glory type careers, so both try to give it a go at some work for an old journey type director. As the film they will do together will be ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane"" soon and slowly the ego and tempers start to flare between the two divas the two become bitter rivals on and off set! The scenes are memorable and the series shows the personal struggles the duo faced in life with family and both appear to be tortured souls inside. The chemistry between Jessica and Susan is in top notch form making this one series to watch to be entertained and informed about two legends.",/review/rw3692633/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2017,davispittman,10," Wow! Excellent miniseries on old Hollywood legends
","I was sooo excited when I heard that FX was going to be airing a mini series on the infamous feud between classic Hollywood screen legends Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. And for Susan Sarandon and Jessica Lange to be playing them?!! Well this just seemed like there was absolutely no possible way for this to fail.... and I was right! Oh my goodness I was dazzled and amazed and touched by every single episode, from one all the way to eight, I loved every one of them. The first episode did a wonderful job at introducing these acclaimed film stars to us and showing the struggles they faced in Hollywood at that particular time in their lives. The next few episodes focuses on the start up of what ever happened to baby Jane? and how everything got started with that classic 60s horror. The performances given by Sarandon and Lange are absolutely incredible! I thought they both captured these women marvelously, they captured their beauty and their pain, both their professional lives and their often times turbulent private lives. That is another thing I loved about Feud, it focuses a lot on the private lives of these women and what all went on to make them the way they were. Each episode really does dive deep into the material and it gives you such insight. If you love things focusing on classic Hollywood like I do then you'll be in love instantly. I just watched the final episode tonight and that was one of the best finales I've ever seen, no exaggeration there, none at all. I just loved the deep meaningful performances given, they really are what makes this series meaningful and memorable, yes the sets and costumes are very well done, but the acting is what will make you or anyone fall in head over heels love with Feud: Bette and Joan! 10/10",/review/rw3692633/?ref_=tt_urv

","Feud is the story of the making of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane told through the lens of the rivalry of its leads.

5 May 2017,mdonovan-23287,10," ""Feud"" becomes a tool
","As someone who worked with actors all his life I'm enormously grateful to Ryan Murphy for putting together with such seriousness and such care this series about a subject that is very rarely if ever touched. And when it is, it tends to be a caricature, a satire, an exaggeration of an exaggeration. Here the drama was tangible and the work of Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon, superlative. They managed to transport us from the times of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, as women and actresses, to our times, without betraying it. The characters were one hundred per cent present and the actresses playing them were one hundred per cent present. If acting is an art, and it is, that mysterious fusion between actor and character is the manifestation of it. - Many young actors I'm working with at the moment, some of which had never heard of Steve McQueen, let alone Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, saw ""Feud"" and compelled and inspire them to want to know more. In the last few weeks I've had them come to me with stories of ""All About Eve"", ""Humoresque"", ""The Little Foxes"", William Wyler, George Cukor... So ""Feud"" has become a tool, an agent provocateur, a gateway to history, the history of their own profession. It's not wishful thinking on my part. I see it in the young one's faces. Discovering passionately, and their horizons broaden automatically. It's a joy to see. As I close this comment a heartfelt hurrah to Alfred Molina and Stanley Tucci for their fearless, remarkable performances and to everyone involved, thank you very much.",/review/rw3692633/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2017,ashwetherall1,10," Truly great TV.
","I don't know how much of Feud is actually true. I'm going with 60% of it happened. But this show is one of the best mini-series of the last 20 years. The show sticks very closely to the known facts about these two fascinating but flaw women and gives its viewer a good insight into how Hollywood was run in the Late 50;s early 60's. The recreation of certain events is brilliantly done. But it was the direction, script and especially cast the really made this show a true classic. Susan Sarandon is Betty Davis, Not a crude caricature but a real person. An actress who wants to be recognised as a star, but feels out shined by lesser talents, namely Joan Crawford! Bette always seems to be saying the right thing in the wrong way but is too proud to admit when she was wrong. Susan's eyes really convey Bette's torment and sometimes childish malice, then regret.",/review/rw3692633/?ref_=tt_urv

21 August 2017,meme-36137,10," A journey into the emotional depth of actors
","This is one of my all time favorites, I decided after I completed the first season's viewing. This show is a force in itself, the writing is so well done, and the two leading ladies Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon, the way they hit their emotional range is the reason to watch this show. Moments of vulnerability, the rawness of the situation, the disappointment within ones self and the betrayals all of these emotions are captured in the best possible way. The characters are fleshed out, they are brought to life by the brilliant cast. I would sum it up by saying in the public eye in general as people we put on our strongest faces, our vulnerabilities hidden deep within knowing that a hint of weakness gives room for exploitation, when the veneer is no longer there we see our vulnerable self. I love how a show and the wonderful actresses managed to bring vulnerability to life, vulnerability of being a glamorous successful woman who lives life on her own terms and being human in general.",/review/rw3692633/?ref_=tt_urv

","With everything that you hear about the once beautiful Joan Crawford through Mommy Dearest, Ryan Murphy & Jessica Lange do an outstanding job of making her seem personable until you feel sorry for her. I think they deserve more Emmys for this. Well Done. Susan Sarandon adds her spunk as Bette Davis and nails it. Thank You Ryan Murphy for your gift of story telling and giving so many women jobs in film/TV. Please grace us with more of your gifts.
