18 June 2020,mr_bickle_the_pickle,8," Great show to binge...
","After watching the whole series, I have to say that I really enjoyed it. It's a really good show to binge as each episode left me wanting to watch another to find out what was going to happen next. I thought the show was well acted as well.",/review/rw5731849/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2020,tobydammit-2,5," Another great series ruined by a STUPID ending!
","The theme music in this beautifully produced series reminds me of Dexter and so does the asinine ending! Short of one of the principal characters becoming a lumberjack, it's one of the worst endings I've ever seen. Stop watching this series about 15 minutes into the last episode and you'll be glad that you did! Superb acting all around, but Cherry steals the show!",/review/rw5731849/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2020,jennifertrathan,5," Episode 8 lets it down.
","I'd only read the book a few weeks before this started so the plot was still fresh in my head, I knew there would be changes but I was really hoping they wouldn't make it completely unrecognisable (Virgin River did this). I was pleasantly surprised that for the first 7 episodes the changes weren't too bad at all, Andy and Laurie were much younger than in the book, Laurie was a homemaker, formerly a schoolteacher and Pam Duffy and Joanna Klein were both originally male characters. There was more but nothing that would have made me switch off in a huff.",/review/rw5731849/?ref_=tt_urv

",I can't stand programs that make you wonder for hours on end and still leave you wondering. The toss up ending is STUPID! Wasted my time.,/review/rw5731849/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2020,hartmaa,9," Incredible effort -
","Beautifully acted - I am becoming a serious fan of Chris Evans. He's not just a pretty faced superhero. He really stood out in Gifted and I'm really excited to see more. Well done.
This is a superbly designed series, I think it is a solid 9 - don't listen to the naysayers ... honestly, it's worth watching just to see the incredible segues in the opening credits.
Watch it, binge it, worth it üòéüëåüèª",/review/rw5731849/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2020,windsorenquirer,4," Unsatisfying
","I haven't read the book. I found this tv show pretty slow but still entertaining till the last episode that ruined the whole show for me. That's why instead of 10 stars i rated it 4.
The ending was weak, I hope they are not planning on prolonging it to the next season.",/review/rw5731849/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2020,smoke0,," not sure why the changes were necessary
","I will just pick on some things that didn't matter - the addition of the girl at school who for whatever reason wanted to be Jacob's only friend - why? I thought it was to add a relatable victim instead of the one in Mexico, but there was no last victim in Mexico, so why include her, other than to pad a few episodes? And of course, no Mexico victim, so no reason for the mother to go off the deep end, so let's have the father confess and burden her that way..and then they are both alive at the end and mom remembers nothing about her year long battle with defending Jacob to herself so now everyone can be happy...naw..read the book instead.",/review/rw5731849/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2020,Fella_shibby,8," It has sufficient red herrings, the direction is top notch n Chris Evans is a treat to watch but

16 June 2020,oceanbluexo,7," Great but terrible ending
",WHY? why would they end the show like this?!!! Seriously had great potential for a satisfying ending and then out of nowhere they leave it like that? So disappointed.,/review/rw5731849/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2020,veronikave,4," I feel scammed
","Extremely disappointed after committing to this show over all the weeks. How can you not come up with an ending to reward the audience? Extremely vague and open to interpretation. Whatever you guys in the industry think, open endings is not what the consumers want. You got us hooked, took our time and money to watch the show, and can't even give us a decent resolution of the story? I will consider this experience when deciding whether or not to watch any future Apple original shows. Very disappointed taken how amazing the show has been until the last episode. Sounds like scam to me.",/review/rw5731849/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2020,toneybrooks2003,5," Overrated
","Indulgent. Melodramatic. Slow. Implausible. Over cooked. This series could have been far, far better. It's a good script, but was poorly directed. The acting is just okay. Worth watching if nothing else is on.",/review/rw5731849/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2020,snowabode,5," I'm Angry about the Ending
","It's wrong to end a story in this manner. After spending eight hours with the story, I deserve an answer. I feel as though all of the hard work of all concerned is diminished because of the ending.",/review/rw5731849/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2020,DunkelheitVZ,4," How to ruin a great show in 45 minutes
","Nearly everything about this show is great: atmosphere, cinematography, music, most actors, story, but the last 45 minutes of episode 8 manage to ruin everything.",/review/rw5731849/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2020,jellyrhubarb,5," Quite disappointed
","Wow, don't understand the high rating. I really wanted to like this. However, in my opinion, the writing is not good. The dialog is so obvious as to be painful at times. I know EXACTLY what someone is going to say next. Other times, you have to wonder why after being married for years why Dockery character is just now asking Evan character about his father. It's convenient for the script but dumb maneuver. There is little complexity here just cliche after cliche. Darnit. These actors could have done much more with a better script.",/review/rw5731849/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2021,BeneCumb,7," Intense, but somewhat predictable and over-sophisticated
","The topic is not novel, similar productions have been before (usually pondering on and over the guilt of a spouse), but a mix of procedural and family drama as here is somewhat more interesting to follow. The performances are solid (all leading ones), but the clues and insinuations revealed step-by-step can be meaningful for viewers, but not from the point of view of active criminal investigation. So the plot got stuck for me in several places and I started involuntary comparisons with topical Danish series where distress and doubts are presented in a more thrilling manner.",/review/rw5731849/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2020,sooz6069,3," So, so slow.....
","The storyline for this drama is good but in reality it is spoiled by the script and lack of pace. It would have been better made into a movie as the series was very long and drawn out. Michelle Dockery tried her best, but it wasn't enough to carry what in the end was a below average whodunnit.",/review/rw5731849/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2020,harshsaxena-17071,5," Defending Jacob, but didn't defend the last episode?
","The last episode, matters a lot, if not most, in any series. If you ruin it, you ruin the whole series. ""Defending Jacob"" did the same. A lot of things went quick in the last episode, and rest of the episodes in series move slower than my gradma. If the finale was good, I would have rated it 8. I'm sorry.",/review/rw5731849/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2021,Yrrepk,9," 91% -- Defending Jacob only has One Flaw
","For me, Defending Jacob is flawless up until the final 10 minutes of the finale. Unlike most others, I felt the ending was just *okay* -- as opposed to completely horrible -- but okay doesn't do this series justice. I think the main issue with the ending was that the audience needed to, and deserved to, know the truth behind Ben's death. And Jaeden Martell's performance was good enough that either Jacob's guilt or innocence felt plausible. Here are a few ways they could've stuck the landing:",/review/rw5731849/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2020,gareth-75442,6," No spoilers here, as there is nothing to spoil.
",An 8 episode limited series for a story that would've been a 2 part episode from the law & order TV show.,/review/rw5731849/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2020,Aries_Primal,1," Slow, boring, clich√©d
","Slow, boring, and clich√©d film with antipathetic characters, learned moves and gestures and too obvious hints. The entire atmosphere is grey, slow, almost dead. Unrealistic happy calm family with perfect house, perfect husband, perfect wife and kid. Zero emotions, nothing to catch your eye or keep your interest on this story. It needs strong patience to watch a single episode!",/review/rw5731849/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2021,KaseyB12,8," True to life in criminal cases
","A lot of people seem disappointed that the ending was not tied up with a pretty ribbon. From personal experience losing a loved one to homicide, I can tell you that these things never ends happily with all your questions neatly answered. There's an array of suspects, conflicting stories, suspicious behavior, events that cannot be untangled and differences in opinion which often includes confirmation bias and armchair detectives, speculation and confusion. There are people who will behave in ways that make you feel extremely suspicious but it's only a hunch and not necessarily meaningful. You can lose your mind trying to make sense of it all. I found the ending to match real life. The iceberg metaphor also hit home. The feeling of your entire life changing. Things will never be the way they were before. There's your life before the event and your life after the event and you do lose a huge piece of yourself in the process. I found myself frustrated with Laurie but she was rightfully confused and scared. We never really get to know the truth. Doubt creeps in. It was well acted even though we've seen these characters before in many shows but has a special twist to it that I thought was interesting. It's not going to charge your life but it's worth a watch to me. Felt relatable and real.",/review/rw5731849/?ref_=tt_urv

",Respected assistant district attorney Andy Barber (Chris Evans) lives in a bedroom community with his wife Laurie (Michelle Dockery) and fourteen year old son Jacob (Jaeden Martell).
