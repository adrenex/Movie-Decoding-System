10 September 2003,grendelkhan,," The series that finally got it right!
","We longtime (read ""old"") fans of Batman have been waiting for a cinematic Batman that reflects the greatness of the comic books.  Unfortunately, we have had to put up with the worst attempts to realize this great character. The movie serials were atrocious, the Adam West show, although entertaining, treated the character as a joke.  The Filmation cartoons and the Superfriends were watered down. The more recent movies are a mixed bag. Then, along came BTAS, and we were finally satisfied.",/review/rw7438799/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10," What a FANTASTIC animated series!
","I loved every minute of this superb animated series, and I am not afraid to say that out of all the animated shows based on the character, this series is without doubt the best of the lot. The animation was fantastic, no better way to describe it really, very dark and fluid instead of the Saturday- morning-cartoon standard that has marred animation recently. The theme tune by Danny Elfman was haunting and memorable, the same Danny Elfman who composed the music for Edward Scissorhands, which coincidentally is one of my all-time favourite movie scores. Also the plot lines and teleplays are very interesting, and I loved the characters, especially Batman, who was dark, brooding and complex like he is supposed to be. And what about the villains? Harvey Two Face, Mr Freeze, the scarecrow, Penguin, and my favourite the joker, who Mark Hamill voiced superlatively, making him sinister and fun at the same time. Though I was wondering, if the producers hadn't replaced their 1st choice for the character Tim Curry, he would've done just as well. I happily award Batman: The Animated Series a 10/10.

10 December 1998,Chiron1987,10," The Pinnacle of Animation on Television
","It has been a long hard journey to mainstream media for comic book characters, but finally Batman made it with time to spare in Batman: The Animated Series (later renamed The Adventures of Batman & Robin). Groundbreaking animation, superior voice-over work, and top-notch stories have made this series into a creation too stupendous to call a ""cartoon."" Each episode was a wondrous, albeit dark, trip through Batman's world, and how he faces each and every obstacle Gotham City gives him.  Much like an amalgam of all of Batman's two-dimensional incarnations, this series' Dark Knight is tortured and driven, but not requite enough to give his enemies pithy comebacks and display romantic charms.  Definitely, this is the way the Batman should and always be depicted.",/review/rw7438799/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2002,TheMan3051,," The real Batman
","This program thanks to people like Alan Burnett, Paul Dini, and Bruce W. Timm made this show the most faithful adaption of the Dark Knight ever. This show was brilliant!!!! It had terrific animation, story line, character development, and action sequences. Regardless of weather you're a Batman fan or not this is a show not to be missed.",/review/rw7438799/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2005,Tenchi64589,," The way Batman is supposed to be!
","When this series first came out, I was at least eight years old; so of course I wouldn't really understand most of it with this being a drama and all... now I realize that this is the most accurate retelling of the Batman legacy EVER! Starting off, compare this to the horrid series they have created now: ""The Batman,"" where they treat Batman like Superman by wondering who he is... it just doesn't measure up... allow me to explain the differences: one of which being the presence of Ethan Bennet. Who you ask? I rest my case... there is none that I can remember.",/review/rw7438799/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2004,wsheit,," A True Masterpiece- the greatest body of animated work ever!
","When Batman: the animated series came around, it didn't take people long to see that it was something different. Here was a ""cartoon"" that was written for adults. It could be viewed by older kids, but it had great depths for the adults who took any time with it. Each episode (or couple of episodes) acts as its own mini-movie. The structuring of the story in each one is just so well executed. As well, the animation (for its time) was quite good, and still holds up well enough today. Another difference from other animation, is that the color palette is quite dark- which, again, only makes it more interesting. All of the great villains are here (and others you may not have heard of), but they get a very serious and, at times, philosophical explication. One of my favorite things about the series, is that every episode has its own orchestral score- meaning, the music that you hear is tailored to fit the exact moment you are watching. Shirley Walker manages to come up with so many sub-themes and variations on the main theme- and works them in so well with the happenings on screen. For those of you that have seen the series and remember it fondly, you might be interested to know that a box-set of the first 28 episodes was recently released- you can get it just about anywhere.",/review/rw7438799/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2000,Kai-18,," The best superhero cartoon ever.
","This is every thing an adventure show should be.  It has action, drama, comedy, tragedy and a truly Gothic feel (fitting that it takes place in Gotham).  The interesting thing about the Batman character is that the only reason he becomes Bruce Wayne is to make enough money to fund his Batman work and to help the less fortunate.  He's such a tragic character as he's given up a personal life for his parents dream.  The stories are wonderfully intelligent and fun at the same time.  There are very few poor episodes in this series (but note that their are some).  Even lame villains like the Clock King and Mr. Freeze are made engaging and exciting.  Ignore the movies and watch the series.  Heck, at times it can even be much more realistic than the movies (like in ""I am the Night"") Some recommended episodes are: ""Almost Got 'Im"" (a poker game where Bat-Villain recount how they almost killed him), ""His Silicon Soul"" (a robot clone of Batman is a little too much like Batman too do a computers evil bidding) and ""the Man who killed Batman"" (in which a small time crook has seemingly killed Batman... by accident)",/review/rw7438799/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2005,Son_of_Mansfield,9," A near perfect Gothic, comic book, superhero, detective series.
","Batman comes to life in his best incarnation yet with stellar voice work, stunning visuals, rich stories, and the perfect emphasis on the dark knight's detecting skills and humanity. Kevin Conroy, sporting a preppy high voice for Bruce Wayne and a scary low voice for Batman, nails the duality of the dark night. He gives the character edge, heart, brains, and wit. Surrounding Conroy are some great actors with distinct voices who follow his lead. Adrienne Barbeau(The Fog, Escape From New York), Ron Perlman(Hellboy), Ed Asner(Elf, also two other great, but short livid animated series: Spider-Man and Gargoyles), John Glover(Gremlins 2: The new Batch, Scrooged), Roddy McDowell(Planet of the Apes), Richard Moll(House, Night Court, Spider-Man), John Vernon(Animal House), and David Warner(The Ballad of Cable Hogue, The Omen, Gargoyles, Spider-Man) are perfect in their roles as is every other actor. The only major problem with the series is that it is too rich for a half hour. The best episodes are the two part episodes like Heart of Steel, The Cat and The Claw, Feat of Clay, and Two-Face. The series could have used more continuity as well. The bottom line is that this is about as good as can be and a real treat for any fan of Batman.",/review/rw7438799/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2002,ilike69ing,," They Don't Make Them Like This Anymore
","Perhaps the best animated series ever.  It provides great accuracy in the stories and characters, while allows innovation and imagination.  They ""pull no punches"" and didn't try to make this a kiddy show.  It became the trend setter for ""Superman"" and ""Batman: Beyond"", even though neither can compare.",/review/rw7438799/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2008,dee.reid,10," A great ""Batman""
","I'm a comic book reader. I also watch a lot of television. ""Batman"" is one of the great shows that has everything we love about the DC Comics character created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger combined with the visual aesthetics of modern-day television. I'm not much a reader of DC's material (Marvel Comics and their Spider-Man and X-Men are my main interests), but Batman ranks as my favorite character from that particular company. While I'll agree that Batman has had a troubled history in terms of television and film (Tim Burton's 1989 ""Batman"" is my #7 movie of all time and is what got me interested in movies in the first place), I've also noticed that he has a massive base of overly rabid fans, many of whom become sore at the slightest change of the character. Well, this animated series appears to be an animation vision that they can finally be pleased with. Of course, Gotham City billionaire Bruce Wayne witnessed the murder of his parents as a child, and grew up to become the mythical ""Batman,"" the masked vigilante prowling the city's rooftops and taking out crime wherever it rears its ugly head. He's aided in his crime-fighting endeavors by his faithful butler Alfred while also nursing many personal demons. ""Batman"" carried over the 1989 film's dark and grim tone, the same tone as the comics that inspired it, as well as the revisionist re-workings of Frank Miller (like his epic ""The Dark Knight Returns"" and ""Batman: Year One""), and proved to be a hit with fans and those eager to forget the campy Adam West show from the 1960s. With this darker approach to the character, it's quite easy to forget that this is a children's show, even though it's also quite obvious that it's aimed at a slightly older audience as well.",/review/rw7438799/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2002,hcl-1,," Finally, someone got Batman right.
",Forget the camp & cheese of the previous Batman cartoons...this is a masterpiece!  The depiction of Batman fighting both the psychos of Gotham City and his inner demons spawned from the murder of his parents years ago is superb.  For years Anime had proved that animation need not be just for kids.  Batman: The Animated Series solidifies that conclusion.,/review/rw7438799/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2021,Mysterygeneration,10," Want to get to know Batman without being sadistic? Watch this cartoon.
","Batman: The Animated Series stands out from the throng of Batman adaptations thanks to its stylized animation, dark stories, and sophisticated character development. Amazing show, I appreciate how different characters and suits are introduced throughout the course of the five seasons, by far the best Batman television show in my view. Bane, like Catwoman and Penguin, is denied an origin episode, and while Batman briefly describes the events that led to Bane's change, we never see Bane's emotional response to those events. Though Batman has always dabbled in the dark, this particular program combines Bruce Wayne's gothic grit with the quirky extremes of a notable rogue's gallery. Overall, I think this is a fairly nice series with a few great episodes and only a few absolutely uninteresting episodes. Essentially, it is a big season that continues the animated series, and both programs are worth viewing together.",/review/rw7438799/?ref_=tt_urv

16 October 2021,Stefan_Loves_Movies,9," The Dark Knight
","Batman: The Animated Series (1992-1995) is one of the critically acclaimed popular shows from the 90s for a good reason. The show was released close to 30 YEARS AGO as we speak, but despite all that, it's still holding up to today's standards! Kevin Conroy, OH BOY! This man is the embodiment of Batman! He managed to find the perfect balance between Bruce's voice and Batman's voice. Kevin Conroy, you're the MAN! The action isn't excessively violent, most of the episodes have a well-crafted narrative with a positive moral at the end. The only thing that's missing, in my opinion, is more continuity between the episodes. I feel like a stronger connection between them would have made the story more appealing, also it lacks a solid ending.",/review/rw7438799/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2022,Foreverisacastironmess123,10," This is my childhood, this is awesomeness, this is Batman the Animated Series, and I will always love it
","In the nineties animated series came in all shapes and sizes, but the ones were few and far between that could truly stand the test of time and remain special and beloved to this day, and this was a show that was better than most of them! In fact I'd even say that it retains its magic and holds up far better than most of its nineties peers. As a kid I took to it probably from whatever episode I saw first, I seem to vaguely remember it being Christmas With The Joker.. Anyway I still love it quite simply because it's awesome, and the writing is so great, as is the characterisation that included real emotional complexity and imbued heroes and villains alike with a depth and frequent poignancy that I don't think I've ever seen done quite as well. The creative minds behind it all really used the mood and character appeal to full effect with all of the main characters. There was endless rich atmospheric moments and touches to take in and enjoy in and a lot of the episodes, especially the early ones have many beautifully gothic shadowy silhouettes and images that are so visually striking they are like artwork, the near monochromatic visual style and the way the characters move almost gave it the look of a comic book in motion, and the result was again, so very awesome! There are so many top episodes to choose from and positively countless nuances and moments, from the heartbreaking Heart of Ice and Baby Doll, Mad Love, to mind-bending and plain thrilling fun such as with Perchance To Dream and The Last Laugh and The Laughing Fish, those are just some of my favourites but any given episode will have certain touches of greatness in it, although not even this fine show was free of the odd stinker! Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, what can I even say, together it was they who were the lynchpins of this show. Their masterfully voiced hero and archvillain were always so engaging and entertaining to listen to, and they each embodied those iconic characters so perfectly that for a lot of people, me included, they have come to be the ideal versions of them. They both got to fantastically shine in such different ways many times, and they played off each other in that excellent way that Batman and his biggest nemesis should have, and Hamill was so freaking good that I think his Joker must have stolen every scene he was in and all of the Joker episodes are a lot of fun, even that dodgy one with the Joker themed casino! In closing I can't say enough good things about this show, it is incredibly deserving of an ideal ten in my eyes. It's a series that inspired a generation and was a fun part of many a childhood, and it remains riveting and wonderful to watch and more than holds up, to me it's a supreme animated series that will be forever classic.",/review/rw7438799/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2017,Christopherreferee,10," Greatest cartoon series of all time!
","This was a show I watched as a kid and I remember the dark beginning intro that used to start and the breathtaking episodes that are action packed and always leaving me wanting more. That is the reason this deserves a 10/10 and is the greatest cartoon series of all time. It's great to have a show that is not just for kids as a lot of adults have grown up watching this and still do now, that is what makes it wonderful as you can enjoy it at any age! With great voices like Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill what is there not to love. If you are wanting to start watching a superhero cartoon show then I must point you towards batman the animated series as it is something you can watch over and over again and never grow tired of it.",/review/rw7438799/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2007,Quinoa1984,10," one of the most entertaining cartoons on TV in the 90s, and not simply for kids!
","The first Batman animated series of the 90s was simple and direct: a TV show not just for kids looking for a good fix with their cereal watching Saturday morning toons, but for fans of the comic books, die hard ones to a fault. Every villain one could want, or maybe even forget to think of, is featured- Joker, Two-Face, Riddler, Mr. Freeze, Penguin, Catwoman, Scarecrow, Harley Quinn, et all- and for much of the show with really captivating single stories &/or continuing story-lines. And for one who still is in love with the original Tim Burton films, Joker especially is given great showcasing in his episodes (i.e. Christmas with the Joker, the Last Laugh), and always with a sense of true gallows humor. But in every episode, as perils come and go and characters get added on like Robin or Vicki Vale, there's depth to what are essentially loose-to-tight translations of what came in the comics.",/review/rw7438799/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2008,refresh_daemon,10," A definitive work in television animation; a legacy that might remain unmatched
","""Batman"", later dubbed ""The Adventures of Batman and Robin"" and then rebooted to ""The New Adventures of Batman"" after a couple years of absence, is probably the most significant animated incarnation of the Caped Crusader there ever was. To some, it is the definition of who the Batman is, stripped of the extremely complex and often retconned story lines in the comic. And while some comic book purists may scoff at the PG nature of the show, I think that most viewers, both child and adult, found a lot to appreciate in its surprisingly mature storytelling, gorgeous animation and its lasting impact on both animation and well as the overall legacy of the Dark Knight.",/review/rw7438799/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2021,adamsmith-51004,10," Possibly the best version of Batman
","This series is outstanding and quite rightly deserves all the pluadits. I remember watching Batman The Animated Series from around the age of 5 or 6 in the early 90's and it has to be considered the pinnacle of cartoon animation. The animation design is beautiful, writing is high quality (better than anything else around at that time and possibly still 25 years later), and the character voice work is perfect. Everything about this series is first class and the producers and writers clearly understood who Batman is and the world he inhabits.",/review/rw7438799/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2011,Aaron1375,9," A series sparked by the success of the first Batman film and was better than all the Batman films of the 90's.
","I saw this show on occasion back in the day and have to say, like the Superman cartoon that was made during this same era this was a very good show as well. It was a much better representation of the corny Batman live action show of the 60's with Adam West and Burt Ward and it never got as strangely dark or corny as the films of the 90's. You got to see many of Batman's best foes on the show with the Joker of course taking the lead and this show actually introduced a new villain who became so successful that she made her way into the comics, Harley Quinn. I never knew she was first introduced in this series until reading some stuff as her character is so polished and well done it just seems that she would have been introduced in comic format first. However, a couple of Batman's villains kind of drew the short straw and were vastly underused in this series too. Bane is one of these, however at the time he was a new character in the comics so I can see why they did not use him quite as much as others. Though if they can do such a good job with a all new character you would think they could write for a character that had been in a number of comics near the end of this show's run. Another character that was underused and there really is less excuse is the Riddler. I enjoy this character and I think he may of had three or four episodes and none of them really did a good job of using him. However, they did a wonderful job on Mr. Freeze, certainly compared to the horrid way he was portrayed in the movie ""Batman and Robin"". Mr. Freeze became my favorite villain during this show's run aside from the Joker. Speaking of the Joker, Mark Hamill does an outstanding job of doing the Joker's voice as does the man doing Batman. This is also the best Batman as it is just easier to make a person look in excellent shape and still have him not sound dumb as a rock. Michael Keaton looks to dorky as Wayne, Christian Bale looks the part, but some times you simply cannot understand what the man is saying. This one looks the part and sounds the part, to bad they can't find a guy who looks and sounds half as good as the one depicted in this show. Very good cartoon, they do not make them like this anymore.",/review/rw7438799/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Batman: The Animated Series"" made its indelible mark on me when I was a kid and it's no secret why this show's still my favorite interpretation of the Dark Knight. You can look at an episode like 'Heart of Ice' or 'Almost Got 'im' and immediately get what this series is about: pathos, but also a playful spin on the rogues gallery (which is extensive); it spends some time on Bruce's inner torment but also has plenty to offer fans of all ages.",/review/rw7438799/?ref_=tt_urv
