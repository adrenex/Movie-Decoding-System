1 April 2020,danielcereto,7," 4k re-watch
","After re-watching this movie for a third time in 4k and 10 years later, I think this is better than I thought the first and second time.
The story is quite simple and enjoyable and most of the characters are true Badass. Action is pretty well done and filming locations are similar to original Predator. Last, I just noticed Oscar winner Mahershala Ali is in the cast! Probably one of his first roles. So, overall a great re-watch in 4k and great movie for franchise fans.",/review/rw3530153/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2017,jackcwelch23,," A pedal to the medal action thriller
","Inevitably this movie couldn't come close to the original in terms of sheer impact. It is, however, such an improvement over the other dreadful sequels that it deserves merit simply for that. Adrien Brody is solid in an against type role, and carries himself well. Every other character had the potential to be interesting but was not explored enough, especially Laurence Fishburne. The action was seriously well done, with flashes of the visceral energy that this series desperately needed. Should have been about half an hour longer to flesh out the characters and maybe have a few more plot twists but as a straightforward, entertaining and visually appealing sci-fi actioner it works. Will not go down as a classic but will always be worth watching when in the mood for an adrenaline rush.",/review/rw3530153/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2019,antant-13838,8," Big fan of this film
","First off I'm a huge predator fan. I love this film. It gives a great take on the predator hunted theme which is basically the same story every generation, and also a smart remake. Great cast every performance hits the write mark and the script does everything it should without any fluff. The ever evolving Predator works perfectly with some great updates. It's a shame Rodriguez didn't follow this on cause that I would have wanted to see. I can see why some fans weren't happy, especially with the Fishburn character but for me it's all very good.",/review/rw3530153/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2014,OllieSuave-007,7," Back in the jungle.
","After Predator 2 took you to the city slums and Alien vs. Predator 1 and 2 took you to a campfest, Predators takes you back to the exotic and mysterious feel of the jungle, where a group of mercenaries, soldiers, criminals and doctors mysteriously lands in a jungle located on the planet inhabited by the Predator creatures. They become prey of those aliens in a deadly hunting game and they need to join forces to destroy the creatures and escape the planet. ",/review/rw3530153/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2013,SnoopyStyle,7," Worthy sequel to 87 original
",This is a strip down predator movie. A group of disparate tough people are parachuted off into an alien world. There isn't much of a setup. They find themselves being hunted by predators.,/review/rw3530153/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2014,bowmanblue,8," Back to Basics
","The original Predator movie was a classic, largely because of its simplistic plot, but naturally helped along by the presence of Mr Schwarzenegger up against a cool alien.",/review/rw3530153/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2011,jzappa,7," Predator vs. Predator
","Predators, an entertaining film with genuine surprises, may be the first movie I've seen to start with a deus ex machina. Yes, the whole plot and all the humans plummet into the movie from the heavens, dropping toward the alien soil, shrieking, groping for ripcords on the parachutes that they didn't realize they had. The last thing they recall is a blinding blaze of light. The first to land, with a powerful thud, is Royce. The others then crash all around him.",/review/rw3530153/?ref_=tt_urv

17 October 2015,classicsoncall,7," ""We're gonna need a new plan"".
","Right out of the gate, the movie disorients the viewer with Adrien Brody's free fall out of nowhere, and it takes a few minutes to figure out that he and his erstwhile companions have been snatched from their own world to provide a trophy hunt for the title creatures. Some new information is provided here about the Predator race, adapting every new hunting season to the latest threat posed by man and his capacity for intelligence and massive firepower. I don't know that I would have picked Brody to be the team leader in an action adventure but he seems to make it work, especially at the point when he reveals that set of ripped abs. I had to wonder if that was an enhanced image or not.",/review/rw3530153/?ref_=tt_urv

","Predators is directed by Nimród Antal and stars Adrien Brody, Topher Grace, Alice Braga, Laurence Fishburne, Oleg Taktarov & Danny Trejo. It's co-produced out of 20th Century Fox by Robert Rodriguez, John Davis & Elizabeth Avellan, with writing credits going to Michael Finch, Alex Litvak and Jim & John Thomas. It's shot on location in the Hawaiian jungle with Gyula Pados on cinematography, while John Debney reworks Alan Silvestri's score from the 1987 film Predator.",/review/rw3530153/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2013,ma-cortes,7," Exciting and thrilling motion picture in which a varied group must fight evil aliens in a dangerous jungle
","Moving Sci-Fi film with plenty of action , chills , thrills and resulting to be pretty entertaining ; including some resemblances to original film . It deals with a group of elite warriors are hunted by members of a merciless alien race known as Predators . They are Royce (Adrien Brody , Nimród Antal specifically chose him for the main protagonist); the Israeli soldier Isabelle (Alice Braga , she is the third brunette actress who appears in the ""Predator"" series, following Elpidia Carrillo and Maria Conchita Alonso) ; the Chechenian soldier Nikolai (Oleg Taktarov , who hit his face on a Steadicam camera and started bleeding , he insisted that filming continued to add effect to the scene); the San Quentin criminal Stans (Walton Goggins who along with other actors did their own stunts in the cliff fall scene); the Serra Leoa militia Mombasa (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali); the drug lord Cuchillo (Danny Trejo , Robert Rodriguez's usual); the Yakuza Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien); and the Doctor Edwin (Topher Grace) awake and they encounter an alien force that begin to attack one by one .

18 December 2010,nicolasmarinus,9," Finally a worthy sequel to a great original
","It's clear they had a real long look at the original film and decided to keep the best pieces (the tension, the focus on group interaction, the music) but also try new things with it to attain the same feel of mystery the original was so good at.",/review/rw3530153/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2010,DICK STEEL,7," A Nutshell Review: Predators
","Just to clear the air, this film is not a reboot or a remake of Predator and its associated follow ups. Rather, it is an able complement to the established mythos, adding its own two cents worth to an expanding franchise, even though it chose to ignore the crossover hybrids with the Versus Aliens films, and connects itself directly to the first Predator film by John McTiernan starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.",/review/rw3530153/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2012,Tweekums,7," Decent enough action but fairly predictable
","We are introduced to protagonist Royce as he wakes up to find himself in freefall over a jungle; his parachute deploys just in time. Once on the ground we learn that seven other people all arrived in the same way at the same time. They are a mixed group consisting of Royce, a mercenary, a military sniper, a member of the Russian Special Forces, a Sierra Leonean rebel, a Mexican cartel enforcer, a man who was on death row, a Yakuza and a doctor. They are armed with whatever they were carrying at the time they picked up and none of them know how they came to fall into the jungle. As they don't know each other there are inevitably problems with trust but as time passes they come to work as a team. Before too long they realise something else is in the jungle with them; deadly predators that are hunting them for sport!",/review/rw3530153/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2010,formicidae,8," Great mix of old and new.
","I'm surprised at the polarized opinions of Predators here on IMDb. From fans of the original movie (like me), I would have expected a degree of respect for this latest iteration; it seems to honor its predecessors while still offering new twists and depth. Without presenting spoilers, I would simply say that there were developments in Predators that present some exciting opportunities for future films. I also always appreciated Predator for its ""gravitas"", and Predators continues that somber and grim tradition with arguably better acting. ",/review/rw3530153/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2010,kosmasp,7," Natural Born ... Hunters
","The movies Robert Rodriguez did, that were aimed for an adult audience always worked, so even though it wasn't him making the picture, but ""only"" being the producer, you'd expect this to be really good. And as far as the action goes, it is pretty good. Although the whole setting does render the first Predator almost obsolete (or makes the first group of humans look like wimps, considering them only having one foe) ... but that's only if you think too much about it.",/review/rw3530153/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2010,Minus_The_Beer,7," To Catch a Predator
","By the release of 2007's dismal ""Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem,"" the ""Predator"" franchise was all but left for dead. Then, a miracle happened as Robert Rodriguez (""Planet Terror,"" ""Desperado"") got his hands on the property. Drawing from a script he had originally penned in the mid-90's, Rodriguez teamed up with director Nimród Antal (""Vacancy"") in an effort to restore the series to its roots. ""Predators,"" the latest saga concerning the jungle-dwelling hunters, is an action-packed roller-coaster ride that successfully ignores the maligned ""Alien vs. Predator"" franchise and plays as more of a direct sequel to the 1987 original.",/review/rw3530153/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2012,wewilsons,9," Different, less tech, best characters. I watch it over and over
","First time I saw this movie I was surprised at how different it was from the first 2. I later bought it on sale and just cant stop watching it. The characters, their interaction, how they work together and how they settup for continued relationship with the outworlders just amazes me. I love the scene where the criminal jumps on the Predator ""F-you space fa&&*t"" ",/review/rw3530153/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2015,jesusdelgado,8," Could watch it again and again.
","Predators picks up where the last two great films left off hunting and killing. The predator is by far the greatest hunter in the alien fictional history. Unlike the last two movies where the predator was on earth in this movie the predator has abducted there victims and placed them on an uncharted planet. For me there are a ton of characters in this movie that I like, the cool samurai guy, the crazy guy in the ship who betrays the survivors. My favorite character was the big Russian guy. At first I was so caught up with all the great characters that I forgot till midway through that most of these characters if not all would die. My favorite thing about this movie though was the fact that there was two different type of predators the ones that we've seen from the other movies and the new ones who apparently are the stronger ones. When I found out that there were two different types of predators, that got me so pumped to see a showdown and sure enough we did. Of course the smaller predator died but it was a good effort. This movie is absolutely one that I can watch again and again and still be interested I loved it. Only problem was they didn't really explain how the humans got on the planet, but still great movie.",/review/rw3530153/?ref_=tt_urv

7 June 2013,The-Sarkologist,8," Robert Rodriguez is a legend
","As I was watching this film all I could think of was how much of a legend Robert Rodriguez is, that is until I discovered that he was the producer as opposed to the director. I guess the difference I see is that the director tends to have a lot more creative input to the movie whereas the producer sees the movie come together from a more business orientated view. However, the modern movie tends to have a lot more input from a lot more quarters that, say, a book, meaning that one cannot generally point to a single person as say 'that is his/her film' though the accolades generally go to the director (and they generally also appear first on the list of the crew).",/review/rw3530153/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2011,jmcginn174,9," Finally A Great Summer Movie.
","Predators is the best summer movie so far and one of the best of the year. I'll be honest I've only seen three summer movies. There was Iron Man 2, The A Team and now Predators. It's just been a really Summer for movies. You can just tell by the previews that they aren't going to be remotely good. Now out of the three Predators is the best movie.",/review/rw3530153/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2016,michaelRokeefe,8," This is a volatile sequel worth its own acclaim.
","Nimrod Antal directs this Alien Sci-Fi sequel to PREDATOR (1987) and you will be enthralled with intrigue and suspense, because this is a creature feature that requires both eyes open. Seven strangers are dropped into a rugged jungle-like forest; each waking free fall as their parachutes open in the tree tops. A mercenary named Royce (Adrinn Brody) and a group featuring a Russian soldier, an unassuming doctor, a San Quinton prisoner, a Mexican drug figure, a mysterious Japanese, Sierra Leone soldier and a military trained female figure out they have been placed on another planet as prey for predators that can make themselves invisible. They think they have found a human ally; but can they even trust each other? They do agree that there has to be a way to survive what is chasing them. Special effects are scary and the predators are nasty ugly. Strong creature violence and gore galore. ",/review/rw3530153/?ref_=tt_urv
