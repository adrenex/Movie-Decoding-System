19 May 2018,pnickovich-781-88739,8," So I started this show honestly finding it annoying and stupid. HOW WRONG I WAS.
","Starting ""Final Space"", I found the lead characters oddly annoying and obnoxious, even though i generally like stupid silly, yet oddly witty humor, it was just too much too soon. But the more the main plot-line proceeded, the better the characters became. The character development in this show is brilliant. Towards the end, one cant help but really feel part of the squad and understand the relations and struggles the characters have towards another.",/review/rw7371922/?ref_=tt_urv

","First episode I thought it was an annoying, try hard, Futurama wannabe. But the character and story development is amazing, ""Chookity"".",/review/rw7371922/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2018,MoistMovies,10," Very rare is under the radar accurately used.. This series is really great
","I have not binge watched anything in a single session in along, long time. 
I have seen almost everything science fiction thats ever been made since 1970ish. Its my crack. 
This was like the feeling of smoking crack for the first time, even tho ive been a scifi junkie for 25+ years. Its some super space crack. 
And i liked it. Allot. 
Dont get deterred by the first couple eps, it picks up major steam after them. I did not expect to like the characters and connect with them on any level.. Its just not something that happens with any animated series to me very often. And im a big anime watcher. 
But i almost felt myself laughing out loud, and then getting a big ol' hold back a tear lump in the back of my throat within the same episodes. 
So rare for a something animated to make you feel that kinda of range of emotions, and care for the character. 
Do yourself a big favor and watch this series. 
I still cant believe its made by a simple youtuber either. Whos content is very mediocre to me. But most youtube persons are to me. 
I guess The great red man Conan saw something in this guy that meant he was destined for much greater things. And he was on the money with this guy. 
Far out. So good. 
In some ways its even better than rick and morty.",/review/rw7371922/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2018,benb-40394,9," You'll finish it in a day.
","When bored on Netflix your tempted with a lot of films and tv shows. As a fan of rick and morty, ""final space"" looked something I would probably watch with ease and maybe even enjoy. The first episode leaves you wanting more and by episode 4 you're a fan. Despite only 20 minute episodes the series does well in introducing all the characters and creating an intriguing storyline, but what surprised me most about this series is the emotional effect it had on me as a viewer. The humour is great, character development is on point and the storyline twists surprise you. A great little series to get involved in for a day until you've finished it.",/review/rw7371922/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2018,calicucu-11923,8," Music: OMG, the music!

31 July 2018,aonenaqvee,9," Fun, Refreshing show!
","These days, apart from the notoriously annoying kids shows, there are no animated shows that aren't excessively vulgar, with a good storyline and animation. However with final space, that all changes. 
 Final space is like a play on guardians of the galaxy and every mature animated show you've ever seen, however manages to do that without being crude or vulgar, 
 The story starts off with Gary, an intergalactic prisoner finding a green alien, who he names Mooncake. The first five episodes are fun, but a bit off putting due to the lack of character and story development. However, starting from the sixth episode, that all changes, and the story takes off.
 I highly recommend this show, so stick with it for the first few episodes, and you'll have the time of your life after that.",/review/rw7371922/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2020,muamba_eats_toast,8," Second season doesn't quite live up to the same standards
",First season was pretty much perfection and a solid 10/10 the most fun I'd had with a series in a while. Season 2 felt a lot less original and didn't reach the same heights whilst still being reasonably amusing and better than most would give 8/10 so 9/10 overall.,/review/rw7371922/?ref_=tt_urv

10 August 2018,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,8," Lots of Potential Here.
",Final Space is looking to be a promising comedy-drama space opera; sure the animation's simple and nothing groundbreaking but I think that's intentional considering the story stretches across the emotional spectrum. It's got some good drama and surprisingly genuine humor strung throughout the episodes; and David Tennant's portrayal of the Lord Commander is probably the star of the show (not surprising considering he's the baddie) alongside Avocato and Little Cato.,/review/rw7371922/?ref_=tt_urv

30 August 2018,Mcduff3601,10," 1st episode didn't really like it...
",...but by the 2nd I was hooked. Once I realized this wasn't really a comedy and more like an action sci fi show with some comedy sprinkled in that just happened to be animated I couldn't get enough.,/review/rw7371922/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2021,garabedian123,9," What is the target audience?
","This show...is 80% amazing and 20% garbage. Its like they had a show that was too adult and then tried to make it for kids but then they went way overboard on trying to make it Rick and Morty kind of funny, and did a terrible job at doing that. But the 80% is still there and hard to ignore..I mean wow, the art, the animation..",/review/rw7371922/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2022,TokyoGyaru,10," I LOVE this show.
","As someone who grew up watching sci-fi on FOX in the 90s, I know what it's like to have my heart broken over and over again by the cancellation of entertaining shows. That familiarity continued into adulthood with Fox (Almost Human, anyone? Sleepy Hollow (except they ruined it first)?) and with Netflix (Everything Sucks, and too many others to name here), so you'd think I could just be like, ""Eh, another one"" by this point. But no. Because Final Space being cancelled hurts more than all of them for the simple fact that the hurt is real. This show had more heart than most TV shows and movies I've personally seen in a while (and I'm a cinephile, so there's that). I'm a sucker for a sci-fi action/drama (or dramedy) ensemble. My favorite TV show of all time, Star Trek: DS9 lives by that ensemble. And it was the same with Final Space for me.",/review/rw7371922/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2018,kyletc,9," Oops I accidentally stumbled on one of the best animated series I've ever watched!
","I hated the first 5 minutes. Seriously, I thought here we go again another lifeless satire show of the space genre... Boy was I ever wrong. It was 2am, I was tired and the show sucked me in so much that I stayed up all night binging the entire thing. What an experience. ",/review/rw7371922/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2018,Rob-O-Cop,8," quality comedy drama, flawed but passable delivery
","This show's lead character is misjudged, overshooting quirky to hit annoying distractingly so, and then some. Essentially it's about someone who harrasses a women until she gives in, and it's offensive and annoying to some degree, but he's tolerable, and if you do there's some great writing going on here (and it feels like i've excused his behaviour in writing that, I haven't but I'm not sure how to handle that aspect of this show). There's some excellent dialog and deep insight with multi layered meaning. There's so much more than the central character and his flaws. 
The story arch is great too, as are the story details, it's fantastical but it's also kept relevant and tight. There's nothing here for flash, it all works toward the story and feel of the show, and does it really well.
If they can tone the central character down a bit this show's a 9 with potential to hit 10.",/review/rw7371922/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2018,tmanandrew,10," Epic, funny......and maybe you will get a cookie
","I have seen the first three episodes and this show is amazing. It has plenty of references to many older films, both sci-fi and not. Has it's own original humor that is fantastic. A story that only gets bigger, and will get more epic. It is fresh, fun, beautiful, and funny as hell.",/review/rw7371922/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,scottmannen1,9," Show Starts Annoying But Gradually Becomes AMAZING!
","The first episode or two are good; however, they still have some annoying parts to them as this show begins trying to stand on its own two feet. The protagonist can come across as annoying, and the robot Kevin can come across as VERY annoying! Regardless, you must push through it because ultimately this show is worth the effort! Do not give up early because you would definitely regret it.",/review/rw7371922/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2022,DMMMUFFIN,8," Why cancel it?

17 April 2018,alejandromyers,10," Sci-Fi and Emotion with a Dash of Hilarity

9 April 2020,Garrrry1234,5," Brilliant first season 10/10, horrible second season 1/10.
","Aaargh, it's so hard to write this review given how great the first season was and how awesome it was compared to the disaster that is it's second season.
The first season was just great. With superb character development focusing on the relationship Gary has with each of the shows characters that all have complex, believable and most importantly, interesting backgrounds that you want to know more about while they turn from being mere strangers into a group of people who will do anything for each other.
Combine this with excellent writing and a great soundtrack, you got an animated masterpiece that most people loved.
The second season is what you get when a new group of writers take over, understanding nothing about the characters and why people love them. A group of writers who merely read the synopsis on each character, watched one episode, misunderstood the entire reason why it has such a solid following and convinced themselves that they could do it better by changing every aspect of what makes it great.
It really is that bad. Gross out humour has replaced intelligent humour. Incoherent storylines with no clear path of rhyme or reason replaces smart, story driven coherent and purposeful episodes. And vapid, uninteresting and expendable characters replace lovable and necessary people you want to learn more about.
Seriously, the characters are so polar opposite to what they were in the first season compared to the second that they weren't even recognisable as from the same universe. Season 2 is what anyone with intelligence dislikes about the majority of animated series. They're just noise, chaos and anarchy with sound bites of adult humour thrown in that just results in white noise. Completely empty and 100% expendable.
I'd still recommend watching season 1 atleast. If you love it like most did. Do yourself a favour and don't even try season 2 so that you don't have to experience the pain we all just did.",/review/rw7371922/?ref_=tt_urv
