10 January 2021,aheaven2005,9," One of the best Planet of the Apes movie
",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is at the same time a great Planet of the Apes movie and a terrific science fiction movie. The way speech is brought upon in the movie is amazing and really brings a lot of reality to something so out of the box. The tension is palpable through the whole movie and there's never a dull moment.,/review/rw3757530/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2021,maxglen,9," A superior sequel in almost every sense
","I liked Rise of the Planet of the Apes, like... REALLY liked it; this is no secret to those who know me or have read my review of the film here on iMDb, but Dawn is a film that holds a special place in my heart, not only because the film is spectacularly made (although that certainly does help) but also because of the circumstances in which I first experienced it which I will get to in a bit. First off, I'll start with what you will first notice about this film, the effects; the CGI in this movie is absolutely incredible, in the first scene alone we see these beautifully rendered apes, lining the trees in preparation for a hunt and the lighting is spectacular as well as the texture work on their skin, fur and depth and wetness of the eyes. They feel real, even now, and for a 7 year old movie? That's pretty impressive. I forgot to mention how this scene also happens to take place in the rain which adds another element of challenge but they pull it off superbly. I mean, you can see each individual raindrop effect each individual ape's fur! Next up on the block is the narrative, now, although admittedly nothing too special, I think considering the approach this film took with it's story, it's done as well as it can be done; I think the lack of truly original story is what drags this down from a 10 for me but I can't hold it back too much as there is only so much you can do with a post ape uprising earth, and what they do do (ha) is done to a tee. The acting is pretty top notch, I think almost every actor does a pretty solid job but the real standouts here are Andy Serkis as Caesar and Toby Kebell as Koba... wow. Possibly the best motion capture performances I've ever seen. Koba is a deeply damaged character who when we start the film, see has calmed down quite a bit now that he is living free with his own kind, away from the humans, but as the film goes on and he is reintroduced to the human threat, he breaks under the pressure and his scars reopen, it's really great stuff. Caesar continues on his natural trajectory from Rise and is now the leader of the California based ape civilisation we saw birthed in that prior movie. We see him struggle with leadership, parenthood and all things in between, it allows us to sympathise with him on another level and feel the weight of his actions as well as the consequences that surround him and having seen him grow from a baby in Rise, our emotional connection with him is already a strong one. Next, we have music. Absolutely brilliant. The soundtrack perfectly encapsulates the feeling of Planet of the Apes as a whole while also bringing it's own flair, making it feel perfect for THIS movie and the scenes that it is used in.
In summary, this is a really, really good film and you should watch it, but I promised I'd tell you my first experience with it and why it means so much to me; when I was 15 me, my dad and my stepmother were all supposed to go and see the film in the IMAX together, unfortunately my dad got ill and it was cancelled. A few days later, my step-mum was supposed to be taking me to the train station, to stay with my birth mother, but unbeknownst to me, she took me to see Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, it wasn't in IMAX but I didn't care, I got to spend some extra quality time with my step-mum and watch a bada** film before I left and it's a memory that perseveres through the many that have faded.
I'm going to give Dawn of the Planet of the Apes a 9/10. Thank you for reading this LONG review and have a lovely day or night, wherever you may be.",/review/rw3757530/?ref_=tt_urv

7 July 2014,gogoschka-1,," Intelligent and thrilling storytelling with amazing CGI – Science-Fiction of the best possible kind
","Among Hollywood's recent output of mediocre (and in some cases: downright abysmal) remakes of Sci-Fi classics, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' was the rare movie which stood out, for it had as much of a brain as it had a heart – plus an original approach to the well-known material and great visuals. Having said that, 'Rise' practically pales in comparison to Matt Reeves' sequel: the upcoming 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is as close to a Science-Fiction masterpiece as a 170 million PG-13 Hollywood summer blockbuster can possibly get.",/review/rw3757530/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2014,ThomasDrufke,9," Apes On Horses
",The Planet of the Apes franchise has always fascinated me but I hadn't been interested until seeing Rise of the Planet of the Apes a few years back. The emotional depth that that film brought to the table was unparalleled in terms of big blockbusters. I was attached to Caesar and several of the other apes. That movie surprised everyone so it isn't much of a surprise that the sequel 'Dawn' looked even better as they hired Matt Reeves as the replacement director. The special effects are some of the best I have ever seen and the acting was surprisingly outstanding. The trailers looked incredible so my excitement was about as high as it could possibly be for an apes movie. And the film doesn't disappoint.,/review/rw3757530/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2014,TheLittleSongbird,8," A blockbuster that takes a bigger approach and with brains and heart
","As someone who really enjoyed Rise of the Planet of the Apes, expectations were high for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. And apart from a rushed ending and the underdeveloped human characters Dawn of the Planet of the Apes didn't disappoint and is just as good. It looks amazing for starters, the cinematography and lighting are of great beauty and atmosphere and the scenery is equally striking. But the visual highlight, and most likely the best thing about the film, are the special effects for the apes, that they look so real and that it's hard to believe they were done by computer is testament to how good they look. The soundtrack is haunting and rousing with no dirge-like tempos and it doesn't feel overbearing either, even with sound with as much authenticity as here. The script also impresses, it's very intelligently done and has a lot of tension and heart. What impressed even more was how simple and nuanced some of it was, like when the apes speak they only need to say a few words and it still feels like it's saying a lot, a couple of times even a sideways glance brings more impact than you'd think. The story takes a bigger and somewhat bolder approach than Rise of the Planet of the Apes and this is an instance of it working very well, especially with the visceral action sequences which are very tense and look terrific and in the incredibly intense and emotional final act. It's compelling stuff where you feel compassion for and identify with every step of the way with Caesar and his family. Matt Reeves' direction doesn't make the mistake of being overblown or lethargic, there is at least a sense that he knows what he's doing. The acting is solid, Jason Clarke and Keri Russell are charming leads and Gary Oldman while criminally underused still gives a spirited performances. But other than the special effects the other highlight is the characterisation of the apes, which is just superb especially for Caesar(who is by far and way the most relatable and most compelling character in the entire film), Andy Serkis never fails to amaze me. All in all a really well done blockbuster, although the human characters do not register anywhere near as well as the special effects and the apes characterisations. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw3757530/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2014,bob the moo,," Well meaning, but a bit too full of its own importance, becoming a bit heavy and ponderous in the process
","I had enjoyed the first film in what I guess is the modern version of the PotA franchise, so I was quite looking forward to this second film. The plot jumps quite some time ahead, to find mankind surviving in small bands following the outbreak of a virus around a decade ago. Meanwhile Caesar has established a community deep in the woods, founded off the survivors of the battle on the Golden Gate bridge. When a group of men ventures into the woods looking for an old dam in the hope of getting power to their community, it tests trust and loyalty within both camps.",/review/rw3757530/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2021,Doublej20005,8," A Great Sequel
","A really great follow up that builds on what the first film set up, and still features fantastic effects, performances and action, even if they still haven't fixed some of the problems with the original. The big issue across these two films is that the human characters are very one-note and bland. Gary Oldman is the only complex human character in it - the rest just have one personality trait that is well explored, if that, and a lot of them make very stupid decisions. But on the flip side, Caesar is a fantastic character, and I really like how the apes' opinions on humans are affected directly by their experiences of them - it makes their characters a lot better. Andy Serkis is still fantastic, and the effects have aged very, very well. The action is really well shot, and has a really nice gritty feel, particularly in the second half. I will say that the first half was a tad slow for me, but I did appreciate how the film spent time building up the characters in order to go all out for the finale. The cinematography is strong and the story is well developed - those opening few minutes really pack a punch now. Overall, I wouldn't call this one of the best sequels of all time, but it is a genuinely great and recommendable film.",/review/rw3757530/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2014,bob-the-movie-man,8," High class monkey business
","There are some films you go to see with low expectations and back in 2011 Rupert Wyatt's ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" was one of those. After the Charlton Heston classic, a long series of increasingly poor sequels and a failed Tim Burton reboot, apprehension was high. But how wrong could I be. This was 100% a 10/10 film (if I'd been doing these reviews in those days): an epic and gripping story; great performances from James Franco, John Lithgow, Freida Pinto and Harry Potter star Tom Felton; and stunningly executed special effects, with Andy Serkis's performance delivering amazing depth of feeling and emotion. (The scene where Serkis's character Caesar first speaks is one of my top 10 ""most goose-bumpy"" moments in cinema history).",/review/rw3757530/?ref_=tt_urv

","It has been ten years since their escape; a massive group of super-intelligent apes, led by Caesar(Andy Serkis), live deep in the woods and thrive in a hunting/gathering culture. A group of civilians not killed by the Simian Flu pandemic are gathered in San Francisco and have been degraded by civil unrest, economic collapse and a shortage of power. A small group of humans led by Malcolm(Jason Clarke)have found an abandon hydroelectric dam in the woods and being able to repair it and get it running again could provide much needed power to summon other survivors for help. But something has gone very wrong; an ape has discovered the group. An iffy peace agreement is reached between the humans and apes, but goes awry when a human gun is found that breaks the treaty. An all-out war is unable to avoid, with the conflict determining which species will dominate the planet.",/review/rw3757530/?ref_=tt_urv

","Dawn of the Planet of the Apes jumps right into the time when the apes are beginning to build a new civilization while mankind is starting to fall apart. What makes this different from the last feature is it once again sticks more to its symbolism. Now this is the real deal of the context, it's obviously a truce between two sides, it is the part that is mostly known as the last chance before the unwanted fate of their world happens. Since everybody knows how things are going to turn out (regarding this as a prequel), it still provides the heartfelt tension of their trust to each other. Unlike Rise, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes doesn't only throw off a visual effects gimmick on screen, it also deeply focuses on the compelling themes beneath the tale.",/review/rw3757530/?ref_=tt_urv

","As an avowed fan of the original Planet of the Apes films and the 2011 reboot Rise of the Planet of the Apes, it was with some anticipation that I awaited this latest instalment in the prequel series. Maybe I had my expectations too high, or maybe the film is just missing that something special, but I left the cinema feeling a little underwhelmed. Of course, the motion capture effects are amazing, the post-apocalyptic atmosphere is suitably bleak (power supplies have almost been exhausted and the human populace is in panic mode) and there is action aplenty, which might very well be the problem. You see, as strange as it may seem given that the majority of characters are apes, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is very typical in both its characterisations and narrative structure.",/review/rw3757530/?ref_=tt_urv

","DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES continues to prove this franchise as one of the most entertaining reboots to come out of Hollywood in an age where refurbishing classic favorites is the new fad. I was such a fan of the first in this new series (RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES) that I actually went to the theaters this time around for the new installment. And it continues to blow my mind in how good these new films are. If you were a fan of the first film, you will most likely find plenty to love in this one. It continues the tale of our species' downfall and the inevitable rise of apes to a position of dominance. It begins around ten years after the end of RISE. The ""simian flu"" epidemic that closed the previous film has eliminated all but a small percentage of the human race, and we're introduced to one survivor camp in San Francisco where their continued existence relies on jump-starting a local dam to restore power. Unfortunately, their journey to the dam leads them into the territory of the apes. The apes, led by Caesar (Andy Serkis, returning), have created their own little utopia, evolving into a functional society, and they are rightfully unwilling to trust the seemingly violent humans at first. Malcolm (Jason Clarke), the man in charge of the human expedition, stands in awe of the apes and what they've become, and he believes a truce can be reached that will allow peaceful coexistence and access to the dam. But there are forces working from both sides that won't allow that to happen.",/review/rw3757530/?ref_=tt_urv

Seeking to reach a broken dam for electricity in the apes' grounds, the humans send a group led by Malcolm. They meet the apes with a wrong start. Caesar give the humans a chance at repairing the dam. Koba, one of Caesar's lieutenant, goes to the city and discovers the humans' weapons pile up. He then finds Caesar deciding to let the humans stay to help his sick wife and contested it, resulting in Caesar attacking him. Koba goes back to the city and gets a rifle.
