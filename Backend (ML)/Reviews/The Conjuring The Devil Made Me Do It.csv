22 April 2013,Vartiainen,8," Suave, charismatic and an affectionate parody
","In my mind a good parody is always also an homage to its source material. Instead of just pointing, mocking and laughing, it respects its predecessors and while it gently pokes fun at their mistakes and general silliness, it also pays tribute to their strong points. And that's this film. It's both a parody and a love letter to those romantic comedies of the mid-century Hollywood where men and women had clearly defined roles, every background was painted, the cars were driven by madly spinning the wheel from one side to the other even though the road was perfectly straight and every single line was delivered with a suave and cocky grin on one's face.",/review/rw3365674/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2017,TheLittleSongbird,7," 50s-60s sex romantic comedies satirised and celebrated
","Well, 'Down With Love' turned out to be a unexpectedly pleasant surprise. Love many of the late 50s and 60s sex romantic comedies, 'Pillow Talk' being a primary example, and can't get enough of those with Doris Day and Rock Hudson which this film clearly was paying homage to. There was the worry though as to whether 'Down With Love' would be just another heavily predictable film with forced comedy moments, no romantic chemistry and no charm with talented casts wasted.",/review/rw3365674/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2019,tabuno,8," A Hit Remake of the Comedy Romances of the 50s
","16 May 2003. This amazing satire of all the great Doris Day, Rock Hudson - and any of the other fabulously tacky, wacky comedy romances of the 1950s are captured in this contemporary but exaggerated version of the actual style of the genre of this period. Whether or not this movie will find a popular home and an audience beyond those who can appreciate its intent of making Down with Love what Chicago did for the musical, Renee does it again. This light hearted, somewhat more convoluted version of the battle of the sexes really hits all the comedic buttons (without any Jerry Lewis physical comedy).",/review/rw3365674/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2003,preppy-3,9," Not for the casual moviegoer
","It's 1962 New York. Barbara Novak (Renee Zellweger) has written a book called ""Down With Love"" convincing woman that they don't need a man or love or sex to succeed and be happy with themselves. Womanizer Catcher Block (Ewan McGregor) is determined to prove her wrong.",/review/rw3365674/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2011,napierslogs,8," As pink and silly as they come, but ""Down with Love"" is a fun romp
","Meet Catcher Block (Ewan McGregor) he's a ""ladies man, man's man, man about town"" type of guy, and Barbara (Ren√©e Zellweger) is more of a man's woman, all decked in pink but independent. She wrote the book on how to live life without a man. Literally.",/review/rw3365674/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2021,perica-43151,6," Corny but amusing over the top parody
","This parody of the 60s movies has zero subtlety, but is amusing and full of references. It is somewhat analytic, has some nice jokes and a lot of in-jokes, but is concerned more with commenting and it is not terribly sophisticated. Still, worth a watch, especially if you know the work Rock Hudson and his magnum opus of trivial love. Extra credit for being prescient about the absurdities of the upcoming age of over the top woke hys teria.",/review/rw3365674/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2018,michaelberanek275,8," Sparky, quirky, tongue in cheek
","There's something so so clever and beguiling about this movie even though at the end of the day it never seems to go anywhere, or really do anything, or say something - about love for instance. Down With Love certainly warrants more than a couple of points for the dazzling production design and art direction. Ultimately I felt I was not watching a film in the usual sense of investing something in it, but more that I was watching an earnest and fascinating product of the film industry, a post-modern wheeze with plenty of ubtuse contemporary cultural references. It had an odd hold for my cinephile self, perhaps like for a train spotter gazing into a whezeing veteran engine, but on a human level there wasn't anything below the artifice and crucially the casting seemed implausible for the romantic couple. I think another reviewer nailed it in pointing out that there was so much effort in parodying the idiocies and anachronisms of the 1960s it rather fell into the trap of appearing just dumb & stupid to the core. But this is an interesting problem in itself, and for me it's worthy of some redeeming points for sheer ambition and spirited effort.",/review/rw3365674/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2004,garboventures,," An underrated gem - glowing pastiche with a post-feminist twist
","I'm surprised to read so many user comments which indicate that Down With Love received some critical acclaim - I recall a very different response, where critics seemed hugely and almost unanimously underwhelmed (maybe this was a UK response?) and consequently, I wasn't expecting too much. This only enhanced my enjoyment - what an underrated gem this movie is!! ",/review/rw3365674/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2007,inkblot11,7," Up with this movie! It pays great homage to the Doris & Rock films
","Barbara (Renee Zellweger) has just written a book called Down With Love. She leaves Maine and lands in New York City, where her book is about to hit the shelves. Unfortunately, the male executives at her publishing house have doubts about the new tome and are not forking over any marketing money. The lone woman at Banner publishing, Vicki, takes Barbara under her wing and they work to get the nonfiction title some fame. First, they decide to ask Catcher Block (Ewan McGregor), a prominent male writer for Know magazine, to do a cover story for the book. He postpones the interview again and again. In the meantime, Vicki and Barbara get the book mentioned on the Ed Sullivan show. Soon, copies of DWL are flying out of the bookstores, mainly because the book empowers women to think more about themselves and less about attracting a man. Catcher spies a picture of Barbara in a bookstore window and knows he has to meet her. However, since he is a notorious ladies man, he assumes the identity of an astronaut named Zip Martin. Naturally, he plays the perfect gentleman when he begins to take Barbara out on the town. How long will it be until Barbara discovers the truth? And, will she have fallen for the guy first? Romantic comedy fans everywhere should love this film. It is a takeoff of the old Doris and Rock movies that are so delightfully fun and full of clean mischief. Zellweger and McGregor are a joy in their roles as the smitten couple. The rest of the cast, including a cameo by Tony Randall, are great, too. The look of the film is nice, as are the costumes and the Big Apple setting. If you love crazy, contrived, comic love tales, get this one tonight. You will bask in its take-me-out-of-my-blues delivery.",/review/rw3365674/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2013,cnycitylady,7," Up with the sixties style films
","Down With Love is a satire film that good-heartedly pokes fun at those films from the 60s starring Doris Day and Rock Hudson, and it does it in the most convincing and charming way.",/review/rw3365674/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2011,southwest3210-156-400970,," Visually stunning.....an experiment of sorts....
","I saw this more as an experiment, a chance to pay homage to a time and place in movie-making. I was also reminded of ""Breakfast at Tiffanys"" a tad in its glamorization of that Jackie Kennedy/Audrey Hepburn period of high ladies fashion. It was sort of a 50's lag, a last vestige of the classy old styles before the hip/hippie modern era would sweep them away forever. Call it the end of elegance, if you will.",/review/rw3365674/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2007,Cristi_Ciopron,," The charming pastiche
","Down with Love is a most affectionate,lovable,luscious parody:and not a mockery,not a derisory spoof,not a derision,but an intelligent, charming , elegant and colorful descendant.It has a capital quality:it is delightful and relishing of merriment,and ingenious and natural;it is luminous and luxurious,and the Doris Day+Rock Hudson originals (Pillow Talk ,1959;Lover Come Back ,1961;Send Me No Flowers ,1964) are not made to look ridiculous.Each element was chosen to be entirely characteristic,and also a bit parody.The pace thrills and delights.This movie is so savory,that it seems too short.The opening credits are delicious;at the other head,the denouement is no less.Nothing is cheap or forced or distasteful.Oh,late fruit!The original comedies,the D./H. comedies I mean,were movies about life and fancy;""Down ..."" is a film about movies,about cinematographic culture,a homage.And a get-together of interesting actors.",/review/rw3365674/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2009,littlemartinarocena,3," Down And Then Some
","I loved the Doris Day/Rock Hudson pastiches and some of the comedies that followed with the extraordinary Doris and a varied but terrific succession of leading men. In particular with James Garner in ""The Thrill Of It All"" The secret there, I believe, was a smart and knowing script an unmistakable chemistry between the stars and performances that were solidly based on reality no matter how ""out there"" they seem to be. Here, the whole thing is so self conscious that we are never allow to go beyond it and actually enjoy the whole thing. Rene Zellwegger is a very good actress but not a natural comedienne. She's at her best when she's thoroughly thorough as in ""Nurse Beatty"" where she was very funny mostly because her conviction was so convincingly strong. Here she plays it like in a SNL sketch and could have worked if it had had the length of one of those sketches. In ""Down With Love"" she's downright annoying. Ewan McGregor, one of my favorites, is not even there. Let me explain. Think of Rock Hudson's commitment to those roles. The charm he was able to emanate and how naturally he became the foil for Doris Day. Here Zellwegger and McGregor don't play opposite each other but against each other. No chemistry whatsoever. Ewan McGregor so wonderful, powerful and beautiful in ""Velvet Goldmine"" ""Shallow Grave"" not to mention ""Moulin Rouge"", is kind of insignificant here. Yes, I'm amazed myself. Doesn't have a hint of the romantic manliness of Rock Hudson, isn't that funny? I didn't like either the on the nose production design, the silly costumes, the theatrical make up and hair nor the unimaginative lighting. Other than that, David Hyde Pierce is, almost, worth the price of admission.",/review/rw3365674/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2003,rosscinema,7," Charming recreation
","This is an homage to the light romantic comedies of the early 60's and a strong influence by ""Pillow Talk"". Renee Zellweger is Barbara Novack and she writes a book about women and how they look at relationships and an editor at a publishing firm named Vicki Hiller (Sarah Paulson) convinces the board of directors to publish her book. One way to get attention to her book is for a well known writer to write an expose of it so they try to get Catcher Block (Ewan McGregor) to do the job but he's so busy womanizing that he keeps canceling their appointments so they try other methods to get attention to her book and they succeed as it becomes a best seller. Catcher is amazed by her success and bets his friend and coworker Peter MacMannus (David Hyde Pierce) that he can make her fall in love with him which would make her a hypocrite and he would have a big story to publish. Catcher pretends to be a shy astronaut from Florida and they start to date. This film is directed by Peyton Reed who has worked almost exclusively in television and is directing the ""Fantastic Four"" next. Film does an admirable job of recreating those type of films that were prevalent in those times. The sets are terrific with the decor for the offices and apartments. Even the scenes like when Zellweger is riding in a car its obvious that its a sound stage with a movie screen behind them showing stock footage of 1960's traffic. The script also does a good job of adding some flavor of 1960's culture like when one of the board of directors describes her as ""The Farmers Daughter"" from Maine. This is of course in reference to Debbie Reynolds and when MacGregor says he's an astronaut from Cocoa Beach Florida its from ""I Dream Of Jeannie"". All pop icons from the sixties. And having Tony Randall in the film gives it the ultimate cavalier compliment. Its not a perfect homage like the scene where Paulson accuses Pierce of being homosexual which would not have been allowed during those times but the lighthearted charm of the film remains intact. Zellweger is fine as usual as Barbara but its MacGregor that caught my eye. His performances in the last two years have never ceased to be interesting. He was almost unrecognizable in ""Black Hawk Down"" and then shows he can sing in ""Moulin Rouge!"" But also shows he can handle playing American dialects. He's an amazing actor to watch and here he adds to his mystique. Film is utterly charming and it does compliment the films from the early sixties.",/review/rw3365674/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2021,mllecathy,10," Should have been a massive hit

1 October 2003,cariart,," 60s Retro in Comedy Spoof...
","DOWN WITH LOVE, director Peyton Reed's homage/spoof of the Doris Day/Rock Hudson sex comedies of the early 60s, is a delightful bit of fluff in a movie season filled with inferior sequels and overwrought epics. Dazzling to watch, with Givenchy-inspired costumes (if Daniel Orlandi does not receive an Oscar for his work, his peers should turn in their Designer cards), wonderfully over-the-top sets (EVERYBODY in those 60s films lived in apartments you could land airplanes in), and a 'More 1963 New York than 1963 New York' look (created on the studio back lot, with ample support from CGI), the film would deserve a viewing even if the cast never uttered a line of dialog!",/review/rw3365674/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2004,MLDinTN,," Some funny situations with fabulous art design
","DWL didn't do to well at the box office.  I guess it must have been due to a poor advertizing campaign.  After finally seeing it, I though it was pretty good.  It's sort of like a battle of the sexes.  Barbara Novak  pretends to be a man hating woman who doesn't need love while  Catcher Block is a womanizer out to prove he can get the DWL girl(Novak) to fall in love. So along the way, we get funny situations, like Catch pretending to be Zip and many over heard conversations that seem to be about something else, ie... the secretary overhearing the sock discussion.  And an unusually scene using split screens with Barbara and Catch talking on the phone.  She's below and he's on top doing pushups.  At the end they smoke. Cute idea.",/review/rw3365674/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2005,nycritic,8," Tipping its Hat to the Doris Day/Rock Hudson Comedies from the 60s.
","To make a movie which pays homage to a specific style of film making and effectively pull it off is a thing not many movies nowadays can say they do. Words like ""noir"" or ""romantic comedy"" or ""sex farce"" or ""genre film"" are thrown around cheaply, and the end result is just shades away from tragic.",/review/rw3365674/?ref_=tt_urv

","Renee Zellweger is absolutely adorable, too cute to be the feminist pioneer who has changed the world, and yet she has.

8 May 2003,Ldyandrea,," Charming and fun, with jokes that would make Doris Dayblush.....
","If only because Ewan McGregor and Renee Zellweger were in this movie, it would be worth seeing.  What you can't expect, however, is the sheer fun that ensues, complete with fake New York City backdrops, glamorous period sets, and even more glamorous costumes, makeup and hairstyles.  After the first few minutes, I began to tire of this homage mentality, but the story quickly sucked me in, thanks in great part to the blissfully neurotic performance of David Hyde Pierce as the friend/boss of Catcher Block (McGregor).  Sarah Paulson is also fun and perky as Barbara Novak's (Zellweger) best friend/editor, and keeps things moving along quite well. His Theatrical Eminence, Tony Randall, even makes an appearance as ""The Big Boss"" of the publishing company.  He, coincidentally enough, was the friend/boss to Rock Hudson in ""Pillow Talk"" from 1959.",/review/rw3365674/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2004,The_Void,8," A charming tribute to the screwball classics of yesteryear
","Down With Love is a love story, told in the ways of the classic Hollywood screwball comedy. The first thing you will notice about the film is the silly noises that go with the character's mannerisms, the garish fashions and the silly looks that many of the actor's exude. After about fifteen minutes, I was already starting to get bored of this and was expecting a very gruelling final eighty minutes; but I quickly got used to these aspects, and when the movie gets into full swing; you'll either be loving it or at least forgiving it's minor irritations. I was firmly on the side of the former, as although I'm predominantly a horror fan; I do have a soft spot for silly entertainment like this. But why not? What's not to like about a movie that will deliver ninety minutes or so of pure, enjoyable, entertainment? I'm not saying I don't like depth, but I am saying that I enjoy fun flicks.",/review/rw3365674/?ref_=tt_urv
