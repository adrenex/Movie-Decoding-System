9 September 2022,Muvilava,4," Could have been EMPIRE
","The characters in EMPIRE all had motives and individual drives. Some similar ingredients were present in Kingdom Business. But due to a mishandled murder mystery (when it wasn't mentioned by one of the characters, the viewer didn't even remember it. When the reveal comes at the end, it doesn't affect the story or none of the characters for that matter), a passive aggressive, self-sabotaging character (the young singer who's supposed to dethrone the reigning queen of gospel, at some point she infiltrates some underground sex scene for powerful men that leads to nowhere), love triangles that don't make sense, half-cooked character developments, half-cooked side storylines, etc.",/review/rw8526738/?ref_=tt_urv
