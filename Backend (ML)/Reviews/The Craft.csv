23 May 2006,coldstick,7," Man oh man, am I in the minority on this one!
","Critics and audiences both pretty much panned this movie, but I actually didn't think it was too bad! Even the critics I normally agree with thought it was crap, and I normally despise PG-13 ""horror films."" So this means one of two things: either (1) I'm too easily pleased, and my taste in movies has dwindled over the years, or (2) 'When a Stranger Calls' isn't nearly as horrible as it's made out to be. Now, to be fair, some of the criticisms of the movie are true--there's not much character development, and not much happens in the story. But man alive folks, how much were you expecting from a movie about a babysitter being stalked? Cut them some slack! As a former babysitter who was watching this flick late at night with the lights out, I can safely say the stalker dude was one creepy mofo! Who knows? I guess stuff like this just gives me the willies.",/review/rw2131847/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2020,rivertam26,9," Simplistic cinematic nightmare
","I know alot of people don't care for this film but I think it's one of the best remakes in my opinion. Let's face aside from the first 20 minutes the original was pretty unwatchable it was followed by a Superior showtime sequel and now remade into it's best form. Taking the originals opening and stretching it out for 90 minutes makes for a simplistic, edge of your seat, achingly suspenseful nightmare. Similar to Halloween in its form and ambitions. Camilla Belle is awesome as the young babysitter forced to work at a gorgeous house in the middle of nowhere to pay for her cell phone bill. Upon arriving she's told the children are asleep but as the night goes on there are strange occurrences and creepy phone calls with the voice of a disturbing Lance Henriksen. It all leads up to a mostly satisfactory finale as the killer and Jill have a face off. The movie is directed stylishly with gorgeous, immersive cinematography and a solid lead performance from Camilla Belle.",/review/rw2131847/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2006,Rathko,4," More Generic PG-13 Horror
","I'm starting to wonder if all these PG-13 horror movies are just glorified screen tests for young and emerging talent. Get a first-time screenwriter, an inexperienced director, a few TV actors looking for their bigscreen break and see what they can do. 'When a Stranger Calls' is a little better than most such recent offerings, but is still completely by-the-book; riddled with plot holes and genre clichés.",/review/rw2131847/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2022,cgvsluis,5," I love this house, like love it. It is almost it's own character in this film.
","This is a decent teen horror film that does a good job building suspense. It would be great for a teen scary movie sleep over. What has it on my horror movie playlist however is the house. I absolutely fell in love with the house in this babysitter being terrorized by a stranger in the phone flick. The house is spectacular and I actually dream about it...it's suspended staircase, the inner courtyard with birds...it's location private but near the water. Yes, it is all about the house and it keeps it on my list. Otherwise this is kind of a slow build suspense film.",/review/rw2131847/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2019,courtneypedersen,5," Mediocre Movie With a Less Than Mediocre Actress
","The first time I saw this movie, I enjoyed it because it did put me on the edge of my seat. However, every time I've tried to watch it since, all I can focus on is how bad of an actress Camilla Belle is. She delivers no emotion with most of her lines and when she does manage to show a sliver of emotion, it's barely halfhearted and very awkward. My suggestion would be to watch it once and then forget about it.",/review/rw2131847/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2019,helencmm,6," A little bit better than mediocre.
","A suspenseful thriller that does not keep you still until 20-25 minutes in the film. At first, I think that it was building tension. But the ""action"" was not that intense until the last 15 minutes I guess.",/review/rw2131847/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2006,walken_on_sunshine,7," When A Stranger Calls (2006):The Doc's Review
","First and foremost i must say it is absolutely unfair to judge a remake on originality considering it is in fact a REMAKE however many overly critical critics don't take that into consideration well The Doc does.When A Stranger Calls succeeds as a horror film for one major reason...atmosphere.No it is not packed with jump scares or an everyday gore fest,it is psychological horror at it's finest.People will claim that last statement is absurd but allow me to explain how When A Stranger Calls is great psychological horror.Like i said this movie is all about atmosphere the eerie music,the dark visuals,the big house,the misty windows it really makes you feel uneasy and creeped out.The way the film is written is very clichéd and very tame for horror but the way it is acted out and portrayed on screen is magnificent.This is one of those horror films where you imagine yourself in the situation that the victim is in.Almost everyone has babysat at one point or another or been home alone so this is a very realistic situation.Also contributing to the realism is the fact that what's pursuing this victim isn't a ghost,goblin,or ghoul but another human being.A sixteen year old girl is alone in an enormous house being called every fifteen minutes by a perverted killer the very idea is disturbing.A remake's purpose is to take an old story and retell it in a way that appeals to a new generation or audience.When A Stranger Calls successfully does that and it also succeeds due to it's psychological way of making you feel like this could all happened to you.Overall this was a pleasant surprise.",/review/rw2131847/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2010,GirishGowda,8," I know I am supposed to hate this. But honestly, I Love It.
","Well I was 16 when this released and I saw it without knowing anything about the plot and I had a crush on the very pretty and cute Camilla Belle after seeing the movie. So, this is one of my ultimate guilty pleasures and I will always love this film. This was coming on TV the other night and I just saw it again for the 6th time without a second thought. I hope you will watch it without any preconceived bad false notions about it.",/review/rw2131847/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2006,claudio_carvalho,5," Weak Remake of a Scary Thriller  Prefer the Original 1979 Version

30 June 2019,annablair-19191,7," A Decent Film In Search Of A Better Star
","The original When A Stranger Calls became known as one of the scariest movies of all time simply for it's brilliant opening 20 minutes. People forget that the rest of the film (besides an almost equally effective closing 20 minutes) is sort of a drag. A remake wasn't the worst idea in the world, especially since the original film's sequel, When A Stranger Calls Back, already improved upon the original.",/review/rw2131847/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2016,Leofwine_draca,1," The perfect cure for insomnia
","Now, I'm all for a good slasher flick, and I don't even mind the modern day ones that flooded the market since the success of Wes Craven's SCREAM in 1996, even though a lot of them are poor. Okay, so I usually wait until they show up on television rather than spend money to see them, but I'm the first person willing to give a film a chance despite negative reviews and the like. I was the perfect demographic for this film: I'm young, I haven't seen the original '70s movie on which this film is based, and I'm easily pleased when it comes to horror. Sadly, I was in for a shock: this is one of the all-time worst movies I've ever sat through, on a par with the similarly execrable BOOGEYMAN.",/review/rw2131847/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2007,kosmasp,5," Stranger than reality
","I haven't seen the original (I thought it was a short, but IMDb stats the running time of the 1979 movie at 97 minutes), but the concept worked better back then. I don't mean that it's not scary getting ... scary phone calls! It just doesn't work that well with the technology nowadays (and one of the ""major"" scares or revelations is just plain stupid)!

5 March 2006,mm-39,8," 4.2 What? More like 7 or 8!
","4.2 What? What is with a 4.2? Too hard on the film. The movie is not a Scream type film. I was surprised. The movie makers did a film in a way that could actually happen. I like the concept! Not a fantasy Scream style film. A nice break in the horror movie filming. The over the top stunts, and blood is replaced with the sick mind and tension of a predator. A slow burn. The story has many little extras. I would watch the movie again. I guess the urban legend has killed the plot twists. If one does not know the story the better the film will unravel. The Colorado back drop is lovely but spooky at the same time. The woods and the cabin feel of the house give a wild and unsafe what is in the woods lurking atmosphere. 7 or 8 out of 10. Worth cheap night. A Friday night date movie. I would buy the movie for 9.99 at Wal-Mart.",/review/rw2131847/?ref_=tt_urv

I'm not a big horror movie buff so i couldn't comment on similarities between this and other movies of this genre, but i found this movie quite captivating. the story line, albeit a little obvious, had some genuinely scary/tense moments and the acting (particually of the lead female role) wasn't bad in anyway",/review/rw2131847/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2006,allamericanpsycho21,1," Just Hang Up...
","Once in a great while I will watch a movie that completely surprises me. One that comes out of nowhere to be a bit of rousing entertainment. One that is pure fun from beginning to end. Well folks, When A Stranger Calls is NOT that movie. It is an unbelievable stupid and far fetched remake of the much better 1979 horror camp classic. Our lead heroine Jill is forced to babysit after going over her cell phone minutes and is harassed by telephone calls from a mysterious caller. Every cliché in the world is used here from the stupid cat-jumping-out-of-a-hidden-spot to the car that won't start to the killer can be anywhere at anytime. This movie is bad...not even bad in a ""so bad it's good way"" more in a ""so bad it's boring way."" Skip this godawful film and save your movie for something else. You'll thank me later, trust me on this. Grade: D-",/review/rw2131847/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2006,macenrae,8," Well done! Not perfect! but fresh, and nice to see..
","With all the shoot em up, blood horror movies that have come our way in the last little while ""Saw, Hostal, Saw 2, The Hills have eyes"" Yes, they have their place, don't get me wrong! I went to see ""When a stranger calls"" with my buddy the other night! Why? Because it's a remake of the 1979 classic, which at the time was excellent and scared the you know what out of everyone! I didn't know what to expect. However I was pleasantly surprised! It was a film made of mood, atmosphere, suspense! Because remember people, what you can't see, what you think you see, what you can't hear, or what you think you hear, is far more scarier then what you do! If you love films with mood, creepiness, suspense and atmosphere!! You'll love it! It brought it back to the roots of the original Halloween. Thumbs up, a solid 8.5 out of 10 Remember folks, it's well done! not perfect! It's spooky, not bloody, It's creepy, not gory! It was nice to see a film come a long like this. Our minds have been conditioned and warped by the glitz and shock value of modern day horror movies, we forget, what's really scary.",/review/rw2131847/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2006,jellyneckr,," If WHEN A STANGER CALLS is any indication of what is to come in the horror genre for 2006, we have a problem
","On this weekend last year, Screen Gems Inc. released BOOGEYMAN, an incoherent and poorly edited mess that somehow found box office success, having the biggest opening for any film released on Super Bowl weekend. Recognizing a successful strategy, one year later Screen Gems Inc. has decided to release WHEN A STRANGER CALLS in the exact same slot. A good move on their part. Unfortunately, like BOOGEYMAN, 'STANGER' is nothing but cheap horror only interested in delivering boo and jump scares as opposed to true terror. Also like with BOOGEYMAN, 'STRANGER' is a horror flick that should have been an R-rated. I'm not one who thinks that violence necessarily makes a movie better. However, in this case having more violence would have helped. *SPOILERS* The finale was too tame. It should have been more violent. Just stabbing the killer in the hand with a fire poker wasn't enough. It was all build up, no pay off. The first two acts of the film are leading up to the encounter between Jill and the killer, yet when the moment arrives, the struggle is weak. This isn't the only moment that seems restrained for a PG-13. Throughout, it seemed the filmmakers were playing it too safe. It seemed like they were holding back and it ultimately hurt the film. Of coarse, it doesn't help that the screenplay by Jake Wade Wall in his screen writing debut, is pretty poor. As a result, Camilla Belle, who showed great promise in THE BALLAD OF JACK AND ROSE, comes across as a bad actress having to deliver some of the worst dialog of any horror films ever. If WHEN A STANGER CALLS is any indication of what is to come in the horror genre for 2006, we have a problem. 4/10",/review/rw2131847/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2006,Phantasm01,6," Slightly better the original...though thats not saying much
",When A Stranger Calls got a bit of a critical bashing when it was released back in February. I guess it was to be expected since most critics are a little hard on the horror genre in general but I was a bit surprised by the bashing it got from regular movie goers like you and I. It has a rather low 4.2 rating at IMDb and if you go to the message board on the site for this film the comments aren't too pretty. Despite this bashing it didn't stop the film from opening at number one and grossing almost 50 million dollars.,/review/rw2131847/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2009,sddavis63,9," An Excellent Thriller That Manages To Scare You Without Any Blood And Gore
","It's really hard to see what you would want from a movie like this that wasn't already here. I thought that after a weak beginning (featuring a sort of ""Tim Burton-esquire"" neighbourhood with a huge amusement park at the end of the street) this movie turned out to be everything I could have wanted in a movie. That beginning seemed to be for the purpose of setting the stage for what would come, so we're introduced to a baby- sitter receiving mysterious phone calls who ends up being killed in what was apparently a rather grotesque (but not shown) fashion. It was totally unnecessary to the rest of the movie. Fortunately, though, that beginning lasted only a few minutes. From that point on, no time is wasted on story development - we're thrown right into things as Jill begins receiving mysterious phone calls while baby-sitting, only to gradually come to the realization that the calls are coming from inside the house. It's sort of a combination of ""Black Christmas"" (the killer inside the house) with ""Halloween"" (the teenage baby sitter being stalked angle) - and it's very well done.",/review/rw2131847/?ref_=tt_urv
