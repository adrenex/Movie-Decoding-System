16 September 2007,buiger,6," This could and should have been much better...
","Average movie. What was best in this film (and that was really good) was the Sound, The Soundtrack and the Camera. All of these where at least worthy of a nomination, if not more.",/review/rw0736803/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2010,evanston_dad,6," Rather Boring Bio of Muhammad Ali
","Michael Mann is a very hit-and-miss director for me. His movies either blow me out of the water (""The Insider,"" ""Heat""), or they leave me cold (""Miami Vice,"" ""Public Enemies""). Unfortunately, ""Ali"" belongs to the latter category.",/review/rw0736803/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2015,jimbo-53-186511,5," Solid performances, but there was definitely missed potential here
","The first thing that I am prepared to acknowledge is Will Smith's performance in this film; he was impressive and seemed to really get into the character of Ali. Although his acting was excellent in this film, I don't believe that he should have been Oscar nominated. Likewise, Foxx and several of the supporting characters were also excellent. The film was also well-shot and generally well-made and from a technical aspect it was a fairly polished product. Unfortunately, that's where the praise for this film ends....",/review/rw0736803/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2005,mstomaso,9," Meet the man behind the gloves and the poetry
","Muhammad Ali is a heroic character with legendary wit, humanity, and boxing skill. Always a fighter and always a lover, Ali's life is a subtle and clever story of dignity, strength, and compassion. And Ali himself wrote that story. This film profoundly reminds me of an autobiography Ali wrote several years ago with the help of a friend. Never afraid to do what needed to be done to get where he wanted to go, Ali was never a stranger to controversy, flambuoyance, acid wit, and an outspoken promotion of truth - even when most of his own fans couldn't see it. This film captures the champ's many battles, not the least of which are the internal battles he wages with himself over politics, his ego, money and his own destructive patterns in relationships with women. But thankfully, it does so in a respectful way which does not compromise the man's heroism, nor does it spare the audience of the laughter, mischief and joy Ali became so well known for.

18 February 2007,wise49,10," The Biggest Modern Day Character Challenge I can imagine...
","Some people never liked Ali. He is one of those characters who is so strong, most people are forced to either love him despite his weaknesses or hate him. He was one figure in American history who never really needed anybody. ",/review/rw0736803/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2002,kyle_793,9," Not a boxing movie, a landmark film
","Well, if you went to Ali to see an boxing movie you might have been disappointed, but if you went to see a great film you hit the mark.  The hype was due.  A conglomerate of great acting, great direction, and a great story has made Ali a landmark film.  This film is socially important because it raises up one of the most notable and underappreciated figures of the twentieth century, Ali.  Many considered Ali just a boxer with a big mouth, but this film finally exposes him for what he truly was, one of the greatest civil rights leaders of our time.  The film makes subtle but amazingly-done comparisons between Ali and other civil rights leaders, notably Malcolm X, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and highlites Ali's influence with theirs. This theme is climaxed in the beautiful scene of Ali (Will Smith) running down streets in Africa with local chidren chanting his name.  At this moment in the film, we understand as viewers that Ali did not fight for fame or fortune, but he fought for his rights and the rights of all black people in the United States and the world.  No other film has exhalted Ali's influence in such a way.  It was beautifully done.  Ali will become one of my favorite films of all time, and I believe will be remembered years from now as the crowning achievement of both the main actor and the director.  I applaud their efforts",/review/rw0736803/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2003,jazzest,6," Surprisingly Quiet, Slow, even Dull
","Surprisingly quiet, slow, even dull biopic for such an aggressive, passionate, and charismatic athlete/historic figure. Probably Michael Mann intended to demystify Muhammad Ali; still I would appreciate if it were more fast-paced, more visually vivid, and more emotionally intense.",/review/rw0736803/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2014,SnoopyStyle,7," Reasonable performance
","It's a biopic of the great boxer Muhammad Ali (Will Smith). It starts in 1964 when still as Cassius Clay defeats Sonny Liston for the heavyweight championship. Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles) befriends the young fighter. He is outspoken, converts to Islam joining the Nation of Islam, and becomes the world wide icon. Jon Voight makes a nice turn as Howard Cosell.",/review/rw0736803/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2002,Old Joe,," Forget What You Think You Know
","He ' floated like a butterfly and stung like a bee' and the world says he was the 'greatest'. Of course I am talking about Muhammad Ali, the world's most famous boxer. The movie to celebrate his life was an exceptional piece of cinematography. With an outstanding cast and hypnotic story, 'Ali' brings to life the controversial and popular boxer that we all love. This movie can be enjoyed by anyone, whether they like boxing or not.",/review/rw0736803/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2002,tomligon,10," Poetry! Rewrites the book on filmic storytelling
","A certain kind of critical response kept me away from this film when it was in theatrical release, and I should have known better!  Michael Mann is one of the most original storytellers working in film today, and his sensibility is absolutely in sync with his subject here.  Muhammad Ali always did it his way, and from the brilliant opening sequence (which breaks all kinds of rules of time and space) to the last scene, that's what Mann does, and with great style, as ever.  Of course if an audience demands a literal drama, they might not catch the poetry Mann and his team create with sound and picture.   Will Smith is outstanding as Ali, vocally and visually, Jon Voight is a unbelievably convincing Howard Cosell, and Mario Van Peebles is subtle and moving as Malcom X.",/review/rw0736803/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2003,Theo Robertson,5," I Agree With Most Of The Critics
","As always the problem of getting someone to play Muhammed Ali is that they don`t have the charisma to play the great man , hell not even Ali could play himself convincingly in THE GREATEST so I didn`t think Will Smith star of weak Summer blockbusters like WILD WILD WEST or the MIB films was going to be much cop in the title role",/review/rw0736803/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2001,imp_tp,10," Excellent Adaptation of Ali's fights
","The fights are not rocky-type or ""entertaining"" but REAL. Inside the boxing ring, things are different. I was glad to see close to perfect adaptation of Ali's fights (I watched documentary on Ali's career). Michael Mann gets credit for painting all the different aspects of Ali's life superbly. Well, 'Ali' is based on a real legend and not a super-hero and so it is hell of a job to portray such a personality on big screen and make it so entertaining to watch.",/review/rw0736803/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2016,anaconda-40658,4," Will Smith's Bout.
","Ali (2001): Dir: Michael Mann / Cast: Will Smith, Jon Voight, Jamie Foxx, Mykelti Williamson, Mario Van Peeples: Boxing film is poorly edited, written and directed by Michael Mann who made the intriguing suspense drama The Insider. Cassius Clay became one of the biggest names in boxing history and certainly a celebrated champion. He switched from Christianity to Muslim resulting in a name change to Mahammad Ali. Highlights includes bouts with Sonny Lipton, Joe Fraser, and a bout in Africa against George Foreman. Unfocused with Ali being drafted and arrested for refusing induction; his brother shot; bad marriages. Many of the shots do not match. The nightclub singers footage is also unnecessary. Boxing footage is exhilarating with a fantastic performance by Will Smith as Ali. Smith holds strong and is the best aspect of the film but Ali deserves a tighter screenplay as oppose to the laziness scribbled down for the screenplay. Jon Voight plays a promoter in what is a fine effort but a one note role. Jamie Foxx seems out of place as Ali's brother, and the footage comes across as distracting. Cameo by Mykelti Williamson as fight promoter Don King but none of it is inspiring or worthy of our attention span. Mario Van Peeples also makes an appearance as the infamous Malcolm X, but again, more would be better. Fine attempt is down for the count. Score: 4 Â½ / 10",/review/rw0736803/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2003,bluetunehead,," solid but flawed
","Ali is a film that both succeeds and fails at the same time. Will Smith's performance was very solid, yet I never was able to shake the feeling that on screen it was Will Smith playing Muhammad Ali and not simply Muhammad Ali.  Perhaps that is through no fault of his.  He truly does a great impression of the fighter.  The script is again decent, centering on several facets of the star's life that go beyond the sports pages. However, overall the whole project has a rather distant feel. The viewer rarely is truly captivated by what is occurring. Michael Mann's characteristic documentary-esque filming style works well in parts, but services to alienate the viewer in others.  Yes, it feels as though you are almost watching a documentary in many cases, as if the viewer is a bystander to the circumstances at hand, but this is a work of drama, not a documentary. I wish someone had told Mann to stop shaking the camera and shifting to view Ali between the standard stock of blurred reporters for a few seconds and do a more typically dramatic shot. With Heat and The Insider, Mann managed to pull off this style successfully. In Ali he does not. In many cases conversations begin to rise but then only dissipate before anything really gripping has been said. Simply put, this film could have used a few more motivational speeches along the lines of a Rocky film. Perhaps it wouldn't have been as accurate, but it would have serviced a more dramatic story, at least one where the viewer really felt involved. Ali goes through two wives in the film and in neither case do they even serve to get very angry with him. Voices begin to rise and then either the woman or Ali leaves the room. The scene ends without any heavy emotion other than stern faces being shown. He's divorced a few minutes later.  The fight scenes also have a lack of emotion.  The film style is interesting and visually stimulating, but it could have used a few `it's over Rock!' lines here and there to punctuate things.",/review/rw0736803/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2006,classicsoncall,8," ""I ain't got to be what nobody else want me to be, and I ain't afraid to be what I want to be...""
","My youth and young adulthood coincided with Muhammad Ali's rise to the Heavyweight Championship, and I followed his bouts whenever they were shown on TV. Thankfully it was a time before routine fifty dollar pay per view cable events. However even though Ali's name had become a household word, I didn't know a lot about his private life, or the deeply held convictions that retreated behind the front page headlines. ""Ali"" does a nice job of chronicling the roughly ten year span between his first title win and the defeat of George Foreman after being stripped of the championship.",/review/rw0736803/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2001,baysidetidal,10," Deeply absorbing emotional trip 5/5 stars (Ali's jogging sequence in Afria will stab you in the heart with its emotionally wrenching revelation)
","There are many critics out there who have given this film negative reviews on the basis that the film didn't succeed in giving the viewers a focused look at how significant and grand Ali was.  I understand completely the motivations and arguments behind those negative reviews.  However, I must say they misunderstood what the movie was trying to do.  Because most thought Ali would be a standard bio-pic, the film was expected to cover a sprawling canvas of a larger-than-life figure of charisma known as Ali from childhood to present with deft focus on his life.  This was NOT director Michael Mann's goal.  Mann's ultimate objective, in my humble opinion, was to create an intimate portrait of a man whom the public saw only as a cultural icon.  To give him a soul behind that grand persona.  To reveal him as a fellow man among men; how he lived, how he behaved in his personal life, how he sat, how he looked, how he talked, every little insignificant moments of his life in the film were there to give the public an idea, a glimpse of him as a fellow human being and not as an icon or a symbol.  That is why the movie was an absolute masterpiece.  Although Will Smith's performance in the film was hypnotically amazing, I must say the real star of the movie for me was Michael Mann.  From the first 10 minutes or so of the montage sequence in the beginning of the movie, Mann absorbed me right in with his achingly beautiful, intimate, and minimalistic photography and compositions.  I still see the imagery in my head going on a loop and forcing me to play back the memorable images my eyes were exposed to as if they were photographic printing paper.  The movie was so beautiful and poignant, I found myself weeping during the many moments of introspective scenes with Ali looking on towards the horizon or vacantly into nothingness as if internally struggling to find his identity.  Before I stop myself in rambling on and on about how much I'm in love with this film and Michael Mann's directing style, I should note that there is a sequence in the movie where you won't resist in emotionally breaking down.  The sequence in question is the jogging sequence in Africa where Ali runs past non-chalantly through a village and looks at children's murals on concrete walls of himself.  I WILL NOT spoil this because I want you viewers to go through the same shock that I had.",/review/rw0736803/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2002,reinout_vanschie,10," Truly an incredible piece of cinema
","I personally think this movie was one of the best of last year. As a biopic it might be interesting to compare this movie with Beautiful Mind, that other biopic that won too much awards. I often thought about, what if Ron Howard,together with his writer made Ali, how would that movie be? Because Ali's life can be told in a very Beautiful Mind'esque way.",/review/rw0736803/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2002,Spleen,8," A fine work, more well-proportioned than it's given credit for being
","The short cut to being counted as a genuine auteur is to use one utterly bizarre, unjustifiable device in each film.  Here, it's the interpolation of digital footage.  Every so often, in the middle of what is otherwise a real film, we'll get some muddy shots that were taken with a digital camera, sometimes shots of the very same kind of thing we'd just seen in 35mm.  It doesn't happen very often (thank goodness).  Why does it happen at all?",/review/rw0736803/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2005,philip_vanderveken,8," Even an interesting movie for people who aren't a big fan of boxing
","I know that biopics aren't exactly very popular by most viewers and sometimes I can easily understand why that is. But some of them are certainly worth a watch and ""Ali"" is one of them. As you probably already know this movie is based on the life of Cassius Clay aka Muhammad Ali. The name on itself already rings a bell of course and I guess this is a must see for everybody who loves boxing, but even when you are not a fan of this sport, I'm convinced it has several interesting things to offer. I'll give you a few examples why I think this movie is worth watching.",/review/rw0736803/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2002,fieldy,1," ...yawn...

2 July 2003,RIK-22,1," Yet another awful Âtrue story' picture that fails.
","Where to start.  Lights, cameras, action and slow motions and that's about it, unfortunately.  There's something that Hollywood must learn about biographical film making is that you must show something that the public hasn't seen before.

2 October 2005,bob the moo,," Entertaining biopic but is overlong and is unsure of itself when it tries to delve below the surface
","By joining the young Cassius Clay as he first makes his mark on the world of boxing and finishing the film before a sentimental and unnecessary look at Ali struggling with his illness, Mann makes this a much better film than it could have been, even if he doesn't full off a great biopic. The plot follows him through his best years and highest profile troubles and is an entertaining look back at this chapter in this life but the focus is on the facts rather than anything really deeper. Like Ali himself, the film is at its best when it is floating, boxing and trash talking and in these moments it is great fun Â but not because the film is anything special but because Ali was. However when the film has to delve deeper into him as a person, it seems less certain of itself and is surprisingly dull. Issues that require a sensitive touch fall flat and, although the film does show him in a bad light, it is mostly done reluctantly and sheepishly.",/review/rw0736803/?ref_=tt_urv

18 February 2003,michaelRokeefe,6," The mouth that roared.
","Michael Mann directs an interesting glimpse into the life of Muhammad Ali(Will Smith). The years 1964 to 1974 show us the winning of the world's championship of boxing, losing it and then the renowned Rumble in the Jungle. As well as the refusal to be drafted into military service and relationships with some diverse people as Malcolm X(Mario Van Peebles), Herbert Muhammad(Barry Shabaka Henely) and Howard Cosell(Jon Voight). The hard work of Will Smith to pull this whole thing off is obvious. And Voight's portrayal of Cosell is outstanding. The photography is excellent and the scenes in the ring are some to be unrivaled. The supporting cast includes:Ron Silver, Jamie Foxx, Michael Michele and Jada Pickett Smith. Ms. Michael needed no script; thanks for just being there.
