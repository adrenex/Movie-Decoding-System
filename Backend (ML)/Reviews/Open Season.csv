7 September 2012,BA_Harrison,7," Karl Urban IS Dredd.
","I've been a Dredd fan for thirty years now, but I'm not about to give this movie adaptation of my favourite comic character a ridiculously high rating purely from some misguided sense of loyalty. Instead, I'm going to give it a deservingly high score because, quite simply, it is a very good film, one that successfully captures the essence of the 2000AD strip, delivering brutal action by the bucket-load, excellent central performances, and inspired direction, all enhanced by breathtaking state-of-the-art 3D special effects.",/review/rw7788519/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2015,ivo-cobra8,10," The Best Comic Action Adaptation movie of the year! It's Judgment Time!
","Dredd (2012 is one of the best science fiction action film adapted by comic book 2000 AD. It is one of my personal favorite movies. This is the character that kicks ass! This movie is so much better than original Stallone film. Stallone's Judge Dredd did not kicks ass, Karl Urban's Dredd did! I love this film to death I love it so much and it is better than Judge Dredd (1995) and it always will be! Dredd kills like 50 people in here, there are 100 of bodies everywhere I love this action film to death! ",/review/rw7788519/?ref_=tt_urv

25 September 2013,ben-798-604758,8," Straight to The Point, Well Directed, Really Violent
","This definitely isn't one of those movies with a lot of character development, but its not your typical action flick either. This is a beautiful work of art with a lot of stylized violence, desolate alleys with shady characters and ill intentions. The grungy neon lights of a dystopian future, the scarlet blood and glimmering glass, the hauntingly beautiful slow motion, what makes this movie great is definitely the visual aspects.",/review/rw7788519/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2012,Lugodoc,10," Perfect Dredd
","I'm a huge fan of the comic 2000AD and the character Judge Dredd since 1979, and this film completely satisfied me. They changed all the right things and kept all the right things. Director Pete Travis tackled the problem of filming a comic book by making something that looks nothing like a comic book and more like an action movie shot on location, with a simple linear plot that keeps rolling and never slows down.",/review/rw7788519/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," I really liked this movie.
","Graphic, gripping, and very well developed. This is exactly what we should see from a comic of this subject matter. The performances are outstanding; everyone plays their role to absolute perfection. Completely loaded with entertaining action and blood to keep you interested. The directing, editing, sound design, and effects, terrific. A criminally underrated movie that I'm glad got the cult following and recognition it deserves.",/review/rw7788519/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2018,garciarichard,9," Criminally underappreciated
","Dredd is a simple action film with a simple premise that suffers from the legacy of a horrid 1995 Hollywood film adaptation to a British cult comic (2000 AD). It's a shame a sequel never saw the light of day, since Karl Urban was superb in his portrayal of Judge Dredd.",/review/rw7788519/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2012,axlrhodes,8," Relax 2000AD fans, he keeps his helmet on and there's no Rob Schneider.
","Seventeen years ago, a Sylvester Stallone sci-fi action vehicle was released into the world under the title 'Judge Dredd'. Based on the character from the popular 2000AD comic book series, the film was a huge disappointment with critics and a source of much heartache for Dredd devotees in the way it seemed to blatantly disregard crucial aspects of the source mythology both in look and tone. Fast forward to present day, a world in which comic book characters mean big money for film studios, surely enough time has passed to give the old Judge another crack of the whip right? I'm happy to say fans of the comic book should be able to relax and enjoy this much darker and tougher representation of their much loved character. Although the film, and it's (permanently) helmeted protagonist is a straightforward and simple beast, it actually works all the better for it. Dredd isn't given a back story or imbued with much in the way of humanity, he's instead portrayed more as the mysterious 'man with no name' whose dialogue is limited to one-liners that usually precedes some serious ass kicking. Where the 1995 Judge film was light and comedic, this version is hardcore and extremely violent with some surprising explosions of brutality meted out in a world that's long since gone to hell. As is pleasingly more and more the case in mainstream action cinema, we have strong female representation in Olvia Thirlby as Dredd's rookie sidekick and a nasty Lena Headey on form and fresh from bad girl duties in the celebrated TV series Game Of Thrones. Dredd 3D can't and won't be considered a classic of the genre, but it's a huge step-up from the Stallone version and should satisfy any and all sci-fi action fans looking for a fun Friday night thrill. Visually arresting and with a sensible running time, Dredd rocks. 3.5/5",/review/rw7788519/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2012,alan_holloway_2,8," A Superior Action Movie
","The basic aim of Dredd is simple – it needs to be bold, true to the source material and full of juicy violence, enough to wipe out the memories of the notoriously poor Stallone attempt of 1995 that threw plenty of money at the screen without bothering to work on anything resembling a decent script.",/review/rw7788519/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2013,Leofwine_draca,7," A noisy and satisfying piece of entertainment
","DREDD is the second adaptation of the cult comic book series Judge Dredd, following on from a poorly-received Stallone flick in the '90s (for the record, I thought that version was passable but weak in places, as is the case with a lot of mid-'90s cinema). This one's a lot more gutsy and compelling, thanks to the lean script and emphasis throughout on bloody action and adult entertainment. No pandering to the teenage crowd here.",/review/rw7788519/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2021,camarossdriver,10," SOOOOOO UNDERRATED!!!!
","""DREDD"" is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIES! I've seen it so many times that I've lost count. Karl Urban NAILS IT as Dredd...actually...the ENTIRE CAST nails it. The story is GREAT...the acting is GREAT...and the cinematography is AWESOME! You might think that they can't do much by basically having the story in one location,but you would be WRONG! How this movie wasn't a blockbuster is beyond me,but if any movie DESERVES A SEQUEL...this one DOES! In the modern era of ""superhero movies"",this movie feels the most realistic and somewhat plausible. HECK...I'm going to fire it up right now for the UMP-TEENTH time.

23 July 2019,Johnny_West,10," Urban Dredd is #1
","Karl Urban is a very under-rated actor. He can play a variety of characters without making it all about himself. He can just act like the character, and be that character. That may not sound like much, but when you compare Judge Dredd to Dredd, the difference is impossible to ignore.",/review/rw7788519/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2012,limoncella-641-42235,8," Judgment Time
","In 1995 when Judge Dredd starring Sylvester Stallone in the title role hit theatres; critics derided it, audiences dismissed it as ""dumb"" and it failed to achieve commercial success. Even though this film has gained a cult following, it just wasn't the Judge Dredd movie fans wanted. Now a low key British film company has had another crack at bringing Dredd to the silver screen, and the result is a great science fiction action film that holds no punches and gives the audience a gritty, gory and surprisingly relatable take on the comic book hero.",/review/rw7788519/?ref_=tt_urv

This was a great action movie with great CGI!!! The villain was none other than CERSEA LANISTER from Game of THRONES! What more could you ask for?

7 September 2012,danceontheceiling,8," As good as it could have been
","Let me start by saying, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, as in my opinion, it did everything right. Sure, it had no real substance of a story line (hence the 8/10) but that didn't take much away from the film. The simplistic story also had its advantages, as more time could be dedicated to Dredd doing what Dredd does best, instead of messing around in lengthy conversations. Besides, a detailed emotional story might have made this film a flop, as the cold, ruthless character of Dredd would have been somewhat diminished if that had been the case.",/review/rw7788519/?ref_=tt_urv

","Set in a future where most of North America is a radioactive wasteland eight hundred million people are crammed into the vast Mega City One. Here justice is dispensed by the Judges who pass sentence on the spot. Judge Dredd is a veteran who has been ordered to evaluate rookie judge Anderson; she just failed her exams but Dredd's superior wants to give her a chance as she is a telepath. When they are called to a triple death in one of the city's two hundred story tower blocks they think it will be routine it is anything but.

The dead men had taken the drug so Dredd and Anderson investigate the nearest drug den; here they arrest a man named Kay. Anderson is almost certain that he was the killer so they arrest him to take back for interrogation.

22 July 2016,NateWatchesCoolMovies,10," Flat out spectacular
","After the floundering absurdity that was 1995's Judge Dredd left a nasty taste in the collective mouths of fans, all went quiet on the cinematic front of Dredd for nearly two decades (I call it the Batman & Robin effect). The clouds parted though, and we finally got one streamlined masterpiece of a flick with 2013's Dredd. Not only is it achingly faithful to the comics right down to Dredd never removing his helmet, but it stands as one of the ballsiest and well made action pictures in recent years. It's never overstuffed or busy, takes the violence seriously, has genuine suspense, a bone deep and super tough performance from a grizzled Karl Urban, a sexy, no nonsense villain and the best original score of 2013 by a country mile. Not too mention it's atmospherics, which are helped by said score of course, to create a sonic mood board of post apocalyptic ruin and urban rot. Dredd is part of an elite department called the Judges, who roam the smoky desolation of Mega City One and act as judge, jury and executioner wherever they see fit. Dredd is a trigger happy juggernaut with no use for scum or criminals and has not a qualm with taking them out like the trash they are, often in brutal, bloody and uncompromising ways. On day he's partnered up with judge in training Cassandra (Olivia Thirlby, perfect), a rookie with blossoming telepathic abilities. A routine call leads them to a gargantuan Mega Block tower called Peach Trees, a sting irony once we see the rampant squalor inside. This tower happens to be controlled by the fiercest criminal overlord in town, Ma Ma, played by a purring, lethal and altogether terrifying Lena Headey. Her tactics go beyond barbaric and she's sitting on the manufacturing of a drug called Slo Mo, which makes the users feel like time is passing at one percent it's normal rate (a gold mine for setting up a scene visually). Ma Ma locks down the tower as the two judges arrive, and decrees that she wants them dead. Now it's a visceral fight for survival against her armies of thugs and miscreants, and a slow ascent towards her penthouse lair, for Dredd to finish her off. The whole film takes place in Peach Trees, so it's a self contained, one location affair, and a goddamn knockout of a movie. There are R rated films that dabble in violence a bit and barely earn their stripes, and then there are R rated films that leap at the chance to show people dying six ways to Sunday. Dredd absolutely decimates Ma Ma's armies in high style and often in super slow motion as they face him while they're high. The slo mo never feels tacky, but has a tactile richness and fluidity that makes the inflicted carnage so satisfying as it unfolds. The score by Paul Leonard Morgan is an uproarious rallying call that drives forward constantly, charging out of the gate in the opening minute as Dredd pursues a van down the highway on his thundering motorbike, and pummelling each scene with heart stopping force until it mellows out for an eerie passage called 'Ma Ma's Requiem' which is my favourite piece in the film and can be listened to on repeat. Pure genius. Thirlby is the voice of reason and the eyes of the audience, experiencing for the first time how ugly this crime fighting business is, and holding her own wickedly. There's a dark sense of danger to the whole thing, a frank and outright lawlessness to the villains, as it's just another day on the job for them. No overacting, no histrionics. Just mellowed out murder and meanness all round. This is the Dredd film that we've been waiting for, and have long deserved after that other mess. Low box office returns means we may never see a sequel (wtf is wrong with people, like, who didn't go see this??), but we'll always have this little blitzkrieg of a flick to re watch time and again. I know I will.",/review/rw7788519/?ref_=tt_urv
