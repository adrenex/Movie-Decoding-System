28 November 2016,evanston_dad,9," Coming of Age in All Its Complexities
","""Moonlight"" may very well be a breath of fresh air to others who are tired to death of our culture's obsession with labeling and categorizing everything in an attempt to understand it. If it can't be easily categorized, it's either frightening and something to be opposed to, or it's abnormal and therefore something to be marginalized.",/review/rw3680706/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2016,Turfseer,5," Atmospheric inner city coming of age story has major third act problems
","Moonlight represents the end product of a collaboration between Barry Jenkins who wrote the screenplay based on a play by Tarell Alvin McCraney. It has an amazing score of ""99"" on Metacritic, with the lowest score being ""63."" When I saw this score my immediate reaction was that this film is no ""99."" It's a lot closer to that ""63,"" a score attributed to a review put out by Slant Magazine.",/review/rw3680706/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2017,A_Different_Drummer,9," keep your eye on Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris
","The reviewer's dilemma (and it is a dilemma reviewers LOVE to encounter) is, in a superb film with superb acting all around, a superb script, and superb directing, you still need to pay special attention to those actors that, in such a competitive environment, stand out as something ""extra"" special.",/review/rw3680706/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2017,CineMuseFilms,9," A tapestry of lyrical moments and finely wrought detail on a journey for self-identity
","Some films are best consumed whole while others give more joy through their fragments. For example, a holistic story with a big legacy is Brokeback Mountain (2005), the modern-day Western with two white gay cowboys as its ground-breaking heroes. Twelve years later, the remarkable film Moonlight (2016) walks into the Brokeback narrative space to echo similar themes but from the African-American experience. Rather than a big story, Moonlight is more a tapestry of lyrical moments and finely wrought detail that are best savoured piece by piece.",/review/rw3680706/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2016,bardia-moose,10," Identity Takes Time to Discover
","To solely categorize this film as an examination of Chiron, a young  African American who has to deal with being gay is accurate but  inadequate. It wouldn't be inadequate to also categorize it as a movie  about drug abuse, school bullying, and isolation. However, if someone  were to ask me what MOONLIGHT is truly about I would say that, at it's  core, it's a film about teaching a child how to swim, feeling the sand  on your skin, and cooking a meal for an old friend.   Director Berry Jenkins is not afraid to be poetic, to guide his film  away from conventional storytelling and offer his audience something to  connect to in their own way. The way his camera roams around is  sensually magnificent; he knows when to cut to the next shot and when  to linger a few seconds longer. But above all else, his ability to add  an extra texture to each scene is awe-inspiring; it's more than just  style for the sake of style; it's essential to the movie's argument.  From the very first shot to the very last, MOONLIGHT is about as  beautiful a movie as you're likely to see this year. The colours are  rich and luminous; James Laxton's cinematography is visually immersive  leaving you stranded inside the story of the film. It moves at a  smooth, welcoming pace. The music, whether it be the classical or  hip-hop selections as well as Nicholas Britell's subtle score, is  perfect. And the performance are, wellÂ… they're the cherry on top.   It's uncanny how similar the 3 actors, who played the kid, teenage, and  adult versions of Chiron behaved and acted; you'd almost think it was  the same actor who played all three roles. Mahershala Ali and Naomie  Harris are more deserving of Oscar nominations than just about anyone  I've seen this year. They may be the standouts, but all the  performances, ranging from the children to the adults, are so raw and  powerful; a standing ovation for the casting director is in order.   But perhaps the thing about this movie that deserves the most acclaim  is its open-endedness; it's fight against straightforward  categorization and recap. MOONLIGHT so much more than a movie about  growing up gay; it's about overcoming your adversities and, despite  being a product of your environment, figuring out who you want to  become. Identity takes time to discover, and that's something anyone  can relate to.",/review/rw3680706/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2016,Quinoa1984,10," I can't wait to see what Jenkins does with his career, it could last a long time.
","Barry Jenkins is a fascinating storyteller, and in large part because of how he goes about being fascinated by his subject, how his camera roams at times, and at others when he knows to cut between his subjects. But most of all, he is a truly magnificent filmmaker because of how he so deftly finds universal themes from a place and people that is somewhat specific. This is a story about a boy who grows into a man - I'm tempted to call it the 'better, bigger, blacker-er Boyhood', though that's not totally the case - but he is also a boy growing up in a largely black, Southern, lower (middle?) class neighborhood, where it seems drugs are everywhere (including his own mother who is an addict) and no one can be ""soft"". And if you're gay, a ""f***ot?"" Watch out.",/review/rw3680706/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2017,marcosaguado,10," Three One Everything
","When a film comes out and you know next to nothing about it with a director you don't know and a cast of mostly unknowns and it blows you away like it did me. Then I know I'm confronted by something unique. In fact it was director/writer Martin Donovan who wrote about Moonlight, urging all his actors to run and see it. Thank you sir. The faces of those three young men who are just one did something to my brain and to my heart. The best group of actors I've seen in one single film in a long, long time. The big surprise is that we knew it all along. It's all about love and what it means to be a man. Thank you Barry Jenkisns A revolutionary film made of truth and beauty.",/review/rw3680706/?ref_=tt_urv

",This seems like a cheap knock off of Boyhood. The characters and actors are all great in this film but the story seems to be a bunch of stereotypes. In the end the main character was supposed to find himself. You can be the judge if that is the case.,/review/rw3680706/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2017,greeenchik,10," Simple, Painful, Outstandingly Beautiful
","Moonlight is one of the most beautiful and heart-wrenching films that I have ever seen. Many users are expressing disdain or presumed it to be dull. Yet, to see it as such misses the whole point of the film. Moonlight wasn't intended to overtly wow us or give us knowledge about something we didn't already know. Rather the film allowed us to enter and follow a life that I'm sure many have never considered living. Yes, we know some about poverty, queerness, masculinity, and Blackness individually, but to see the conflict of it all so succinctly woven together allowed the complexity of some folks lives to be seen in an unadulterated way. Moonlight wasn't supposed to give us some grandiose finale or even answers, but simply present a narrative that we often don't see. And that's what makes it so simple, painful, yet outstandingly beautiful. ",/review/rw3680706/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2017,claudio_carvalho,6," Does not Justify the Hype
","""Moonlight"" is a dramatic and very well acted film about three stages in the life of a black character since he was a bullied boy and teenager in Miami until his adulthood in Atlanta. The first part (""Little"") is heartbreaking, with the boy Chiron completely lost between the rejection of his crack addicted mother and the love of his new friends, a drug dealer and his girlfriend. The second part (""Chiron"") is inferior but also attractive when Chiron is an adolescent and the problems and doubts he has to face in this difficult phase of life practically alone. Unfortunately, the third part (""Black""} is awful; Chiron has become a strong man (the biotypes totally different from his childhood and adolescence), drug dealer and gay.

","""Moonlight"" won the Oscar for Best Picture. While this clearly means that the folks at the Academy enjoyed and appreciated the film, this does not mean that the movie is one that most people would enjoy. Like ""The English Patient"", there seems to be a real disconnect between Hollywood and the viewing public...and the film isn't particularly enjoyable to watch...and at times, it's actually rather painful or dreadfully slow. Not a terrible film at all...but I don't understand all the hype.",/review/rw3680706/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2020,briancham1994,6," Runs out of steam
","This film is not quite a masterpiece but it had the potential to be one. I can definitely see what everyone else is talking about - the cinematography allows us to ponder the surroundings, the acting is compelling and the overall feel is rather emotional and unique. The main problem is just that the whole film runs out of steam in the third act and feels really slow and aimless.",/review/rw3680706/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wanted to see as many 2016 films as possible, especially those that won or were nominated for the big awards.

20 November 2016,Red_Identity,," A masterwork
","Words cannot express how I felt after watching Moonlight. It's hard to write a review for a film that touches you so powerfully, so emotionally, because there is nothing else you can say aside from just how deeply you felt it. I felt it, possibly in a way I haven't felt a film in years. So simple in its premise, but incredibly written, directed, and acted. It may very well have one of the best final scenes I have ever seen. Something that also stood out that I didn't particularly expect was the amazing cinematography, so free flowing and so acutely able to capture the characters' feelings. This is a film that is not to be missed, a film to be celebrated through and through.",/review/rw3680706/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2017,Kingslaay,4," Best Picture?
",Moonlight is a film that lacks depth and a plot that would weave it together. If anything it is a display of somewhat random and uninteresting events in a person's life. It is as if the director decided to make a documentary on a random person's life who grew up in a poor part of town with no special significance attached to that person. Through the three stages of the film we see no significant or key events that engage the viewer. Perhaps I need to be a lot more artistic to appreciate it but it may be that viewers create or invent artistic moments in the film because it does not contain it. ,/review/rw3680706/?ref_=tt_urv

","We all have our place in the world, it can just take a little longer for certain people to decide on both who and what they want to be. Our formative years play a big part in the life we choose, as do the people and environments that surround us. Barry Jenkins' Moonlight is a quite exceptional piece of cinema that explores these ideas in such a wonderful and intimate manner.",/review/rw3680706/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2019,jaredpahl,1," A Critic's Wet Dream. A Filmgoer's Worst Nightmare. Moonlight is Woke and Broke. The Most Overrated Movie Ever Made.
","I cannot think of a movie as comprehensively championed as Moonlight. A 99 metacritic score, a best picture win, sure to be on the very top of dozens of 'Best of the Decade' lists, and nary a single voice of dissent on the internet. It's career suicide for a critic to bash it, and reputation suicide for anyone else to do the same. Am I wired differently than the rest of the moviegoing world, or is the power of potentially being branded with the dreaded label so strong that no one has the courage to speak up and call this thing out for the self-important garbage it is? There isn't any movie that deserves the ridiculous critical fawning moonlight enjoyed. Least if all this tepid indie arthouse trash.",/review/rw3680706/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2017,joshteggert,10," In reality, ""Little"" happens (pun intended) but 'Moonlight' shines as a wonderful exposition of the complexity of emotions.
","It is difficult to effectively display certain inner conflicts one may experience during the coming of age, but 'Moonlight' stunningly portrays three chapters in the life of a young, black boy and his struggle whilst growing up gay. Starting off with Little (Alex Hibbert); a boy who is taken under the wing of local drug dealer Juan (Mahershala Ali), followed by him as a teen, referred to as Chiron (Ashton Sanders), slowly uncovering and accepting his sexuality, then finally as a man (Trevante Rhodes), living his life begrudgingly with the burden of his troubled past. All this is then juxtaposed by a very difficult relationship with his mother, Paula, (Naomie Harris), falling in love with his best friend, and getting bullied consistently throughout school. The consequences of each prospect are dealt with astonishingly, somehow illustrating issues that have deep and dark implications with serenity and consideration. It simply is wonderful to watch.",/review/rw3680706/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2016,spencergrande6,9," Hello Stranger My Old Friend
","A singular and personal vision. An expression of a feeling, a mood, a time and place that together form empathy, understanding, and art.

","This film grips you from the very beginning. Its not an easy film to watch as it portrays the struggles many black men face growing up in marginalized neighborhoods. Its survival everyday. And for the main character, it becomes evident from the very beginning that his struggles will be augmented due to the difficult predicament he was born into.",/review/rw3680706/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2017,demented_peruvian,7," Works better if thought of as a good indie, rather than an Oscar winner
","I remember the 'good old days' when IMDb review forums had a more balanced array of reviews, instead of everyone rating something 1 or 10, and then adding politics. So I'll add some of that to the mix. This was my experience: I watched it post-Oscar. My reaction: ""Moonlight"" is that type of movie that is best appreciated as a ""hey, that was an interesting indie; it's well acted and I wonder what the director will do next"", instead of an Oscar winner for best movie and best screenplay. It's the type of film that I would have added to my list after seeing it show up somewhere in the Independent Spirit Awards, like ""L.I.E."", ""Our Lady of the Assassins"", ""Paranoid Park"", etc. It's stylish, it captures a slice of life, and it is mostly engaging. Unfortunately, like others point out, it feels under-done, like each act was cut short a little, and in particular the last act is underwhelming, and too much like a first-time screenwriter's autobiographical play. It's Oscar-winning screenplay is ironically quite short on story-telling, dialogue (yes, sometimes appropriately intentionally, other times just not very creative), and scenes that will engage enough.",/review/rw3680706/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2018,robinssa-98507,8," A tough watch that will stay with me
","I watched this In two sittings and was glad of the break. The three ages of the main protagonist all play their part excellently, and each in their own way shows a sadness and sense of being trapped with a secret that is unacceptable to the people around them, as a child, teenager and adult. Not a world that I've ever seen portrayed before which is why I think it is worthy of its accolades. This feels like an insider account of growing up gay in a tough neighbourhood.",/review/rw3680706/?ref_=tt_urv
