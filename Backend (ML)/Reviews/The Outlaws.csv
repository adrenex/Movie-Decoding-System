28 February 2017,yitzi,9," Very Interesting even if you believe Hitler died in the Berlin Bunker
",I believe that I am better versed on the history of WWII than most. However I am amazed at the extent of the Nazi network and infrastructure this program has uncovered in South America. The so called Rat Lines in South America that Hitler's high command developed would cost 100's of millions to replicate today. So even if you accept the orthodoxy of Hitler's suicide in Berlin in 1945 this show is still very interesting and well worth watching.,/review/rw4072291/?ref_=tt_urv

","OK, so I saw the ads for this show and decided to tune in... I saw that Steve Rambam was in it and I had seen him in another interesting show about private investigation which I watched and liked... This show is a train wreck by comparison, the assumptions made with little or no proof are ridiculous. Every time they encounter a torn down house they firmly conclude AH lived there or hid there without a bit of evidence other than some old farmer saying 'Yeah, my father said a German lived there'.... Horrible, horrible show that ends up proving nothing except that people will produce anything, no matter how stupid, and expect other people to watch it, no matter how stupid... I felt stupid after 10 minutes of watching this crap and hung around to be able to write this revue of a really terrible show. Steve Rambam has to be embarrassed by this mess I am sure... Being proud of this show would be insane...",/review/rw4072291/?ref_=tt_urv

","I find all of this stuff very intriguing and have watched every single episode so far. I'm as skeptical as anyone else and take all of it with a grain of salt. It does appear legit and I myself as well as others are curious about our history being accurate about this subject. At the very least, I am learning allot about WW2 history and just how elusive and evasive the Germans were in their escape from Berlin during WW2.",/review/rw4072291/?ref_=tt_urv

","As I persisted with the interminable episodes of what turned out to be the first series of this tripe, I marvelled how the makers could possibly pad it out to 8 episodes. And when I finally got to the 8th episode, I looked up imdb, and found there were another two series of it!!",/review/rw4072291/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2016,dano1330,8," Keep watching before making a conclusion
","As a World War II history buff, I came to this show with a great deal of skepticism. I've seen every episode that's aired up until 29 November, 2016. I've read several of the posted ""User Reviews"", many of which were written after only a few episodes of the 1st season. Yes, this is a ""Reality Show"". These shows intentionally give bits of information during an episode and end it with a ""bombshell"" in order to entice viewers to continue watching. ""Hunting Hitler"" certainly uses this formula. However, this show has dug very deep and, using recently declassified documents and thorough investigation, it's building a solid case for the possibility that Hitler actually did escape Germany. The show uses facts to build its ""escape"" scenario: 1) experts determined in 2009 that the pieces of skull the Soviets had were not Hitler's, as the Soviets claimed. It's actually part of a female skull. 2) It's a proved fact that Hanna Reitsch flew into Berlin on 26 April, 1945, via an improvised airstrip near the Brandenburg Gate (a large road where documents show that streetlights that lined it were cut down shortly before Reitsch's landing) and flew out using the same airstrip on 28 April. Reisch was Germany's most famous test pilot. This documented, factual flight proves that it was possible to fly Hitler out of Berlin. Also, the 1st season showed new information regarding previously unknown tunnels, one of which lead from near Hitler's Undeground Bunker to the Brandenburg Gate. While much of the 1st season covered possible scenarios for Hitler's escape from Berlin and how he could've gotten to South America, the 2nd season is uncovering much more convincing circumstantial and factual evidence that prove the possibility of Hitler's escape isn't just a Conspiracy Theorists' dream. (Spoiler!) Most of these confirm the existence of many high-ranking Nazi officials living in a small village called Missiones in Argentina. Missiones is located within 1-2 miles of a (now crumbling) compound built deep within a thick forest. The solidly constructed buildings, hand-built stone walls and recovered military/personal artifacts certainly point to it being a protective compound, completely surrounded by fortified defenses, for a very high-ranking Nazi official. Also, (BIG SPOILER!), Herman Goering's great-niece lives in Missiones, as well as a man who claims his father was the driver for Martin Bormann. He says his father told him that sometimes he would drive Bormann to the edge of the jungle and Bormann would disappear in the jungle. This review covers the last episode aired (""Eyewitness Accounts"", 11/29/16), which presented compelling evidence, including the aforementioned ""bombshell"" of a supposed picture of Hitler at an elderly age. Of course, it won't be shown until the next episode, but my understanding is that an expert will evaluate the picture and determine its authenticity. Hopefully, you see how this 2nd season has upped the ante in terms getting closer to proving whether Hitler actually did escape. As for those who doubt it because they think Hitler would've continued his quest for world domination, it's possible that, if (a BIG if) he did escape, he didn't have access to the drugs he abused and, therefore, survived the withdrawal, leading to the conclusion that, even as an egomaniac, his reign was over and survival was his only option. I'm still skeptical about the whole thing, but I'm definitely not going to miss another episode!",/review/rw4072291/?ref_=tt_urv

","This, so called documentary, is very speculative and the so called specialists/professionals are jumping to the conclusion way too fast, and find what they want to find and make their own ""fantastic"" story of it!

Now clutch at straws about what happened, things that were possible, but didn't actually happen.

15 December 2015,jason-fluffy-391-32919,10," Intriguing !!
","Most people agree that Hitler died in 1945, all the evidence points towards that...except it doesn't!!! Its a fact that the FBI and CIA were very interested in the whereabouts of Hitler after the war. There is no evidence what so ever to prove he died in the Fuhrer bunker in Berlin in 1945. This series follows a trail sparked off by FBI documents released in 2014 relating to their own search for the him. OK ,the guys in the series ham it up a bit, but I'm sure its all part of the production per-requisite. Fascinating and most certainly believable! A ton of high ranking Nazi's escaped to Argentina after the war for a fact, why wouldn't Hitler?? Do you think he'd stay behind until the last hours??? A great watch, even if over dramatized.",/review/rw4072291/?ref_=tt_urv

23 November 2020,Drat1964,1," Utter rubbish
","The premise makes no sense at all, if the FBI knew he was still alive and living in Argentina (as the show suggests) they would have gone after him, you only have to look at the effort put into the Nuremberg trials to see how much they wanted to bring all the Naxi's to justice and Hitler (as leader) would have been the most wanted of all, they would have gone after him, no matter where he was. The show of course never presents any real evidence it's all based on assumptions, which the hosts leap to with repeated consistency. While the actual evidence that Hitler shoot himself, is ignored as is the multiple reports of witnesses is also that he shoot himself. Hitler's own psychology suggests he was not the type to runaway and hide, his own last comments suggest someone who could not face his defeat or that he would want to live in a bunker hiding in Argentina
While the history channel can do very good documentaries, they also seem to produce rubbish like this, things like ""ancient aliens"" use the same logic leaps and assumptions, when the who and the how of who built meso American structures has been well explained by main stream science and no ""aliens"" where required.
As for Hitler, the actual story that he shoot himself as his wife took poison and then their bodies where burned, remains the main view of what happened to him, and nothing in this nonsense series really presents any solid evidence that alters that, even history channel cancelled this show.",/review/rw4072291/?ref_=tt_urv

9 May 2018,MiketheWhistle,4," Interesting but not possible - proven hitler died in bunker
","First I like all kinds of documentaries and am very interested WW2 era.Many will stop at the beginning because they think it's ridiculous that Hitler could have escaped and the show does prove imo that he could have and that others definitely did.
The problem with the show is that I find them intellectually dishonest in that the Soviets finally released prove that hitler was dead and they had his remains. DNA test showed a women's dna (that the show could have gotten someone from Eva Braun's family to test against if they really wanted), but there was dental work that was very peculiar and specific to hitler and xrays that were had and they matched. So in short, the Soviets hid for decades definitive proof that hitler was dead.
So although I believe the show should have disclosed that big fact, it was still interesting in that how many nazi's did escape and how they did.",/review/rw4072291/?ref_=tt_urv
