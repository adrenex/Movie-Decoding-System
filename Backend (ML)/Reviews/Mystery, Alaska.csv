30 March 2020,cardsrock,8," A fascinating story
","Aaron Sorkin's directorial debut is a solid, entertaining entry from 2017. His script is full of his trademark rapid-fire dialogue and keeps the film moving at a brisk pace. The voiceover can be a bit exhausting at times, but it adds a lot of context to the film. Chastain and Elba are both terrific and each get their moments to shine. The film is a tad long, but it's never dull. Molly's Game is a very interesting true story that lends itself well to cinema.",/review/rw4163311/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2020,DLochner,8," A phenomenal Jessica Chastain
","A fast, excellently written and well-cast film. Jessica Chastain plays outstandingly well as both a fragile beginner, a brilliant winner as well as a strong woman. I would advise everyone to take a look at this strip.",/review/rw4163311/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2019,deloudelouvain,8," If I had to rate it in poker terms I would say Full House.
","What makes this movie interesting is that it is based on a true story. That alone makes you watch the movie with different eyes. And even if I didn't understand all the details fully as it was sometimes complicated to understand all the legal terminology, certainly for a guy like me that has a different language than English, it got all my attention during 140 minutes. A long movie that doesn't get boring, there are not much of those. The cast is well chosen and they all contributed to the good story. Jessica Chastain as Molly Bloom has the perfect physique to play that character. It seems that Idris Elba only plays in good movies so when I see his name I'm already excited to watch that movie. Molly's Game is an interesting story, even for people that have absolutely nothing in common with poker and rich people. Better than I expected.",/review/rw4163311/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," Jessica Chastain nails her role
","I don't think Molly Bloom could have been cast any better than with Jessica Chastain... she nailed her role. Oddly enough, she looks similar to the actual Molly Bloom.",/review/rw4163311/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2020,classicsoncall,8," ""I bet heavy on the favorite.""
","The thing that fascinates me about the life of Molly Bloom is how virtually inconsequential things in and of themselves can have such a major impact on one's life and career. I'm thinking of the little sprig of pine needles that upended her Olympic trial run for which she was a virtual shoo-in. Then there was the jerk Dean Keith (Jeremy Strong) who hired her, and despite his irritating persona, introduced her to the world of high stakes poker gambling which the feisty woman took as a challenge and ran with. Having hung on long enough to learn the game and the major celebrity players involved, Ms. Bloom (Jessica Chastain) eventually struck out on her own and became an even larger force in the gambling world.",/review/rw4163311/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2018,TheLittleSongbird,9," A highly enthralling game
","With an interesting subject matter, advertising that drew me right into wanting to see it, a great cast (Jessica Chastain, Idris Elba) and one of today's best screen writers in Aaron Sorkin making his directing debut, 'Molly's Game' had a lot going for it and had more than enough to compel me to see it.",/review/rw4163311/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2020,andrewroy-04316,8," Molly's Game is an engrossing, personal biopic anchored by an exceptional performance from Chastain
","Molly's Game has some small rough edges, but the thrilling and personal journey you go on with Molly is supremely effective. Molly is a great character for Sorkin's writing style, which his critics are quick to attack as overly perfect dialogue and everyone being the smartest person in the room. Thankfully, Molly always is the smartest person in the room, and we do see her stumbles as well. The film didn't take the path I expected - rather than show the various segments of her life, we're given her skiing history as a backdrop and spend the entire movie seeing her climb the world of massive poker games. This works, though it may also be the thing holding the movie back from being an all-time favorite from me - a lot of the time is spent on the logistics and drama of the poker games and Molly maneuvering around the men playing, which leaves less time than I'd like to delve into her psychology. Sorkin primarily gets around this by using voiceovers, which I think work very well here, though they are more exposition than inner monologue. We understand that Molly is exceptionally gifted from the opening of the film - both extremely intelligent and a world class athlete (if anything, Sorkin was too heavy handed in showing her intelligence by listing her GPA and LSAT score, I wouldn't have minded a bit more showing than telling there). Her father's influence is an essential psychological component to understanding Molly, but we get a more or less run of the mill overworking father and rebellious daughter depiction. A scene late in the movie that is clearly meant to be the emotional climax of the film between them does not come off very cleanly, with her father giving her ""therapy"" and explaining that their animosity came from her seeing and subconsciously knowing he was cheating on her mom. The story is well told and Chastain is just fantastic the entire film, so I still was deeply invested in her journey, but had we understood her psychology better and seen her ambition for success more than in a couple forced moments between childhood skiing flashbacks and running the poker games, it would have been everything I could want. Her struggles with depression and addiction are very important and great when mentioned, but they're only really present when Sorkin explicitly draws attention to them rather than integrated naturally throughout the script, though Chastain does give hints here and there in her interactions. Idris Elba is great as her lawyer, with a great monologue late in the film and consistently good chemistry in dialogue with Chastain. We do see some interesting legal themes in the unjust way the government or FBI take advantage of the pressure the legal system puts on people. Most of the thematic meat, however, comes from the social cues going on in the poker games. The games are a transparent look at the most powerful people in the world, and what do they look like? All men, almost all white, and they all lust for power and women, who they see as objects. Chastain uses this to her advantage by hiring a few other women who the men will lust after but who are also very intelligent and aware, as well as using her pull over men to keep them coming back and rack up some big tips. I thought Sorkin did a very solid job directing, with the attack scene being especially well done with its use of pale colors. Molly's Game is a very good movie and Chastain's performance, one of my favorites in recent memory, elevates it even more. Slightly more thematic depth and investigation into her psyche and how she views competing and succeeding and Molly's Game would go down as one of my favorite movies ever, but as it stands it's a great biopic and an enthralling story.",/review/rw4163311/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2020,dar0417,7," Chastain is brilliant
",Interesting story that is a lot more than just some illegal poker games. It has great acting and digs deep into the politics in our society on many different levels. There has been a lot of power driven women films released this year but this one is at the top of its game.,/review/rw4163311/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2018,gortx,," Less a dramatic movie than an illustrated Podcast
","If you ever wanted to know what a video illustrated Podcast would be like -- then MOLLY'S GAME is the movie for you. Jessica Chastain stars and narrates as Molly Bloom, a former Olympic skier who found herself as a Poker madam who ran ultra-high stakes underground gambling games in L.A. and New York. The high priced events attracted Hollywood celebrities, wealthy financiers, baseball players and the mob. Chastain/Bloom narrates and narrates and narrates. When not narrating, we are given picayune details on gambling, the law, what exact drinks are being served and the ins and out of skiing. Chastain is a wonderful actress, but, she doesn't possess the most proficient narration voice. But, of course, the real 'voice' here is not the actresses, but writer (and first time) director Aaron Sorkin's. It's all very much delivered in his trademark fast rhythms and idiosyncrasies. Sorkin should have just cut out the middle-man and done the narration himself. 
 
 Sorkin is obviously a gifted writer, but, Sorkingthe DIRECTOR fails him here. In the past, fine filmmakers like David Fincher, Danny Boyle and Mike Nichols knew that as good as the writing is, you also have to show the audience what is happened. Instead, we are told what has happened, what is happened and what will happen. We are told what the characters are not only thinking, but what they are about to do. The effect is suffocating. The viewer is given little to chance to take a breath, let alone enjoy the drama. ",/review/rw4163311/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2017,PotassiumMan,6," Chock full of Sorkinian glibness, biopic goes south in the end
","Aaron Sorkin's directorial debut about the Olympic skier Molly Bloom, a brilliant over-achiever who chose to forego law school to become a gambling entrepreneur, is a compelling film that starts out very strong. Even with its lengthy running time, it's never slow or uninvolving. It's gripping and fascinating throughout, thanks to Sorkin's master penmanship at keeping the dialogue and tempo of the film at a heady pace.",/review/rw4163311/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2022,Instant_Palmer,9," Brilliant! Sorkin Should Have Been Nominated for Picture/Director & Won Adapted Screenplay; Chastain Deserved At Least A Nom
","One of the best films of the year was almost completely snubbed by The Academy, something we are now (2022) starting to see as a pattern. Chastain puts forth one of two best performances of the year (no surprise), and Sorkin deserved not just a nod for Adapted Screenplay, but to take home the hardware (and at least two more nominations for Best Picture and Director).",/review/rw4163311/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2018,dromasca,5," verbose and boring true crime biography
","Americans love the true crime genre. The big bookstores in the US have dedicated true crime books sections. Many of the Hollywood or independent films are based on true crime stories, biographies and memoirs of people who walked on the wrong side of the law. Good and bad books, good and bad films. ""Molly's Game"" (written for the screen and directed by Aaron Sorkin and based on the auto-biographical book written by Molly Bloom) is a good example of how short is the distance between the good ones and the bad ones.",/review/rw4163311/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2021,mycannonball,8," Fast and Snappy
","This fast-paced true story (inspired by) feels like a thriller at times as Molly navigates the high stakes men's world of gambling. Jessica Chastain is believable as a woman who pulled off this ""game.""",/review/rw4163311/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2018,areatw,7," Fascinating and rewarding biographical drama
","There is a lot to like about 'Molly's Game' and the film gets a lot more right than it does wrong. I always enjoy films based on a true story, especially when they are as unique and interesting as this one. It's also always refreshing to see a biographical film without knowing anything about the story beforehand. I for one had never heard of Molly Bloom or her story, so it really made for fascinating viewing.",/review/rw4163311/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2017,borromeot,7," Clinically sharp
","The focus is clear and yet cold and distant unless Idris Elba is on the frame. He is a human with his complexities but without barriers. He is open, accessible. Jessica Chastain is a technical marvel to be admired but it is hard, very hard to warm up to her. I felt I needed to see in her what Idris Elba saw and I could do it with my head but not my heart. In any case, it is a brilliant performance. Aaron Sorkin writes and directs this time with remarkable self confidence. The film, like the script is clinically sharp, surgical actually. I bet it's also a great read. For Aaron Sorkin's fans and I count myself as one, this is a must.",/review/rw4163311/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2017,Serge_Zehnder,8," A True Tall Tale of High Stakes
","Nothing comes close to the rush of winning, at least according to those who have succeeded where others have failed. Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain) managed to become a millionaire with a dose of luck, will and endless street smarts. The former professional skier ran high stakes poker-games in Los Angeles and New York and found herself in the middle of a federal investigation, where she was accused of colluding with organized crime.",/review/rw4163311/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2019,MOscarbradley,8," Terrifically entertaining.
","All you need to know about ""Molly's Game"" is that it's an Aaron Sorkin picture, (he directed it as well), and you're hooked. Sorkin is the best writer of dialogue in the movies, just as he was once the best writer of dialogue on television and here he shows he's a damn good director too. The subject is poker and Sorkin's genius is that you don't have to know anything about poker to enjoy this massively entertaining film. Molly is Molly Bloom, a one-time skier, who ran one of America's highest stake poker games until she was arrested by the F.B.I. and she's played, terrifically, by Jessica Chastain, who just happens to be one of the best actresses working in movies today. She completely dominates the film, which is something considering just how good everyone else is, (there's a great cameo from Bill Camp). This is a brilliant movie, the kind of highly intelligent film you hardly ever see at the multiplex these days. See it.",/review/rw4163311/?ref_=tt_urv

3 February 2018,hpcmakeup,3," The narration is terribly annoying...and it is through the entire movie.
","Molly's Game could have been interesting but it is so slow and has so many pointless scenes. then other parts are random and rushed...like her driver being her friend and meeting the Russians...and then other parts are so dragged out...skiing at the beginning and every scene with her dad, Kevin Costner, that the movie is a complete mess. I'm surprised I mad it through the whole movie. And honestly the ending is ridiculous, the acting gets really bad and you just keep saying, is it over yet??",/review/rw4163311/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2018,thebricks,4," Dumbed down; the book was much better
","It was sad to see how much this movie was dumbed down from the book. There was lots of great material in the book. The main focus should have been on how Molly organized the games and who was involved. However, the director felt that adding Kevin Costner and Idris Elba's characters and the skiing subplot was more important than actually telling the story faithfully. There was so much detail about what went into setting up the games and they totally ignored it and actually invented other things. Like for example, I do not think the drug problem was even in the book, and if it was, it didn't mess her up that badly. It's like the actual games and the celebrities involved were an afterthought. Without the names of the celebrities involved, the story had less of an impact. They were just Hollywood C-List actors and extras. Tobey Maguire also got a total pass, they went light on him in the movie; I can't believe they didn't even include the Shufflemaster debacle and worse yet, the time he demanded she bark like a seal for a tip.",/review/rw4163311/?ref_=tt_urv

","Molly Bloom very clearly played a role in writing this movie about herself.

13 May 2018,sierralouie,10," Chastain is a knockout
","Molly's Game works as well as it does due to the sheer vitality of Jessica Chastain's performance. As an actor, she isn't the most overt emoter, and she doesn't need to be. She manages to draw an incredible amount of empathy out of her characters, always in control but willing to let the cracks in the armor show. She is one of the most remarkably restrained, yet emotionally potent, actors in Hollywood. She excels at taking these strong, resolute women through hell and back, coming out stronger and more complex while being very aware of the gender dynamics of her characters. Molly Bloom is by necessity steely and crafty, but she is also a human being in a world that oftentimes has no regard for humanity. As Bloom, Chastain is a scorching force of nature with a hell of a wardrobe. It's easy to praise her more dramatic moments later in the film, but watch her every move during her initial rise to power. You want to root for Molly as she begins to learn, as she faces disrespect from her boss, as she gains more and more confidence.",/review/rw4163311/?ref_=tt_urv
