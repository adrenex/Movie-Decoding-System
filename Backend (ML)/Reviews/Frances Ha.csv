18 November 2001,Anonymous_Maxine,8," You can't hold the cheesiness against it.
","Orgazmo is the kind of movie that is cheesy to the point that it's obviously meant to be that way. You can't watch a movie like this and think even for a second that it is meant to be taken seriously, or even that it takes itself seriously. And all of this is clear just from looking at the cover box, so you know from the minute that you pick the movie up that you are about to watch an extremely goofball comedy. With that in mind, you can really appreciate Orgazmo for what it is.",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2004,Captain_Couth,9," Underrated porn parody from Trey Parker and Matt Stone.
","Orgazmo (1997) was the second live action feature film from the South Park duo. Following Cannibal: The Musical, the duo of Trey Parker and Matt Stone satire the world of ""Adult Entertainment"".",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv

17 April 2017,bowmanblue,8," Definitely NOT part of the 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'
","'South Park.' What more needs to be said? If you aren't aware of the animated cartoon aimed at adults then you really should check it out. And, if you do (and you like it of course!), then you should then definitely check out 'Orgazmo.' It's written and starring South Park's two creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone and the film could almost be described as a 'live action version of the cartoon.' Basically, it's the same mixture of irreverent humour mixed with slapstick, f*rt jokes and a healthy dose of satire mixed with just enough heart to elevate it over your average 'gross out' comedy flick.",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2005,Stoli_Raz_N_7,8," Outrageous self-deprecating adult humor.
","Obviously this film isn't for everyone. It certainly isn't for all of those individuals who take themselves way too seriously, and over-analyze everything. And sure, it doesn't take a whole lot of brains to appreciate this movie; although it doesn't hurt to have intelligence as long as you have a sense of humor. Read the other reviews. Those who didn't enjoy this flick are either so religious that they shouldn't have watched it in the first place, or are overly self-important and humorless people. That being said, I really enjoyed Orgazmo. Parker doesn't just make fun of Mormons, adult entertainment, and super-heroes: as always, he makes fun of himself and his own movie. How could he possibly do such a thing? Well, it's easy when you have a sense of humor. The great Don Rickles once said, ""Laugh. Laugh at other people and laugh at yourself. Believe me, you'll like yourself a lot more when you can do that."" As for Orgazmo, see it yourself, if you have a sense of humor. And if you don't, then stay away from it. Or get really high and watch it. The choice is yours.",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2010,gavin6942,7," South Park Guts Make Live-Action Humor Work, Too
","Joe Young is a Mormon, spreading the word of Jesus Christ in Los Angeles. He stumbles upon a house where they are shooting a pornographic movie, and despite his beliefs, finds the lure of compensation too good to turn down a role.",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 1999,Chiron1987,," Lowbrow comedy brings a lot of laughs...
","Orgazmo appeared and disappeared faster in 1997 than Showgirls.  Part of the blame is the nefarious NC-17 rating which both did not deserve.  However, Orgazmo is the better of both films simply because it tries much harder than Showgirls did to deliver a product based purely on shock value.",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2001,modusa,7," funny, silly, irreverent romp from the makers of South Park
","I've seen Orgazmo many times and I always have to chuckle over it. The beginning of the film is fantastic: filled with zingers, and the furious fists of a Mormon martial artist. The concept is fresh: a young Mormon acolyte on a mission tries to make money for a special wedding ceremony by appearing in pornographic films. Director/Writer/Star Trey Parker is great as the innocent Joe, and his South Park partner-in-crime Matt Stone as photographer Dave steals every scene that he's in. The film stalls a bit just before the climactic final scenes but overall, it is very funny and really not as offensive as detractors of Parker and Stone would have you believe. Well worth it for fans of their series, and for people who like their comedy irreverent.",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2012,bkoganbing,7," Orgazmo and Choda Boy
","Although I've not met many LDS missionaries who were quite as unworldly as Trey Parker, Orgazmo is still a fun movie which combines the unlikely subjects as LDS missionaries and pornography.",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2003,kokosnuss74,," Is there any other way to spend an hour and a half?
","I consider Roger Ebert, of Chicago Sun Times the greatest movie critic alive. But after reading his critic on this flick I realized he didn't get its meaning. `Orgazmo' is not about wit, cleverness or anything. It's not even an attempt at making a good movie. `Orgazmo' is any movie-amateur's dream. Here it is: a movie that is daring, funny, full of inn-jokes, and stuff you can use in your day to day life and make friends laugh at it. Anything better than the Japanese duo that struggles with the pronunciation of English sentences? We've seen it; we know it's true. This movie has absolutely everything. Let me tell you what you're in for: a vulgar exposure of American Society trough Mormons; a sent up of porno flicks (in a scene a black guy is used as a double for a white guy); Hollywood's lifestyleI mean, keep an open mind and you'll enjoy this one. Rate: 4/5",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2000,Quinoa1984,7," South Park meets Ron Jeremy
","This film is very silly, very stupid, and very funny. Thanks to writer/director Trey Parker, we can view at the industry known as Porno in a way that is not as serious as in Boogie Nights. The film takes some turn as that are known to happen in these types of movies, but it is even more humorous than in the others. Not to mention Parker teams up with his South Park co-star Matt Stone as a guy who doesn't want to sound like a queer or nothing. Along with a funny cast of supporting characters, this may not be Parker and Stone's best achievement yet- matter of fact in a way it lacks the polish that their first collaboration Cannibal the Musical had- it's still a worthy effort with enough laughs to make it worthwhile. If only once, as a teen. B",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2005,FiendishDramaturgy,8," Endearing comedy-porn.
","This is a comedy-porn, rather than a porn-comedy, as there *is* no pornography to be found herein. While sex acts are alluded to, there is no execution of said acts in this work. The NC-17 rating is surely indicative of this fact.",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2002,dayenes,," ""I think we should start with a close-up of MY A$$!!""
","I have watched this fine piece of of cinematic brilliance over 30 times and I'm still not tired of it.  Literally, HILARIOUS, from start to finish, from the perfect ""porn trak,"" G-Fresh, Choda Boy, Dave the lighting guy, ""Sancho,"" Lisa, T-Rex, all the porn actors, MAXXX Orbison, and my personal favorite, A-Cup. Why hasn't A-Cup been in more movies?  This upsets me. This is REQUIRED viewing.  Too funny to miss. Giving you a synopsis of the story would be a waste of time. ""What's that?  You dirty girl!  I can do that!""",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2010,therealadrian,10," Hilarious movie from the makers of South Park
","Fans of South Park will love to go back and see the live action movies of its directors, Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Orgazmo even features Trey Parker as the main character, Orgazmo.",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2005,Boggman,8," Trey Parker= Brilliant!
","What can't Trey Parker do? I mean seriously.you would think after all the South Park episodes the guy would run out of comedy?? Parker just keeps chugging along, and he is getting better and better along the way.",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2005,movieman_kev,7," the REAL Mighty Joe Young
","Devout Mormon Joe Young (Trey Parker) is going door to door trying to sell his bible with his Mormon friend (who's never heard from again). When he shows up at a porn producer's house and attacked by his goons for interrupting a porn scene, he beats them all up. This cause the porn producer to want Joe to be in his movie for no good reason at all other than it advances the story. Joe reluctantly agrees to pay for his upcoming wedding. But then sh*t hits the fan in many different ways. This film is pretty funny when you don't really pay attention to the plot and in in the right frame of mind (IE. drunk off your ass or stoned out of your mind) MUCH better than the sad ""Baseketball"" alleged comedy.",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2017,13Funbags,8," Another comedy classic from a real genius.
","I don't know how it took me so long to see this movie.I love South Park, That's My Bush and Baseketball but somehow I never got around to this movie.I'm glad I finally got the chance to see this because it's great.Trey Parker plays a Mormon who is sent to Los Angeles to knock on doors and annoy people but ends up playing a superhero(Orgazmo) in a porn movie.Orgazmo has a gun that makes people have crippling orgasms and it's extremely funny.To make things even better, his co-star is a graduate of MIT and he has figured out how to make a real orgasm gun and they become real life superheroes.They do cheesy special effects like having a person turn into a dummy before he gets thrown against the wall and it's comedy gold.They even use some real porn stars to spice things up.The real gem is that they got Lloyd Kaufman to do a cameo.This is a great movie and all fans of Parker will love it.This is a must see.",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv

13 March 2014,SeriousJest,4," Kept a Smirk on My Face, but Comes Across as Silly and Lazy
","Jeez, these South Park guys really love to go after the Mormons! To be fair, though, they often portray them as happy and good people, despite their wack-job religion. Parker & Matt Stone often seem to be on the same wavelength as my funny bone (no pun intended), so although this movie was silly and came off as thrown together with little effort, I couldn't help but keep a smirk through most of it. The acting of Parker and Bachar in this film was very good, especially in their expressions.",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2005,MovieAddict2016,4," Silly crude humor that isn't very funny -- makes ""South Park"" look sophisticated
","Although I am not by any means obsessed with ""South Park,"" I do think it's a very funny show and the film adaptation was hilarious. Trey Parker and Matt Stone can be quite funny and I thought certain scenes of ""Team America"" were genius. (And others... not so much.) But their second film outing, ""Orgazmo,"" has to be their weakest effort. I expected a clever and crude satire of the porn industry -- instead I just got stupid crude humor without many laughs.",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2002,bob the moo,," Simply put  IT'S JUST NOT VERY FUNNY
",Mormon Joe Young is door knocking when he is forced to defend himself.  He catches the eye of a porn producer who recognises that Joe's fighting style could be used to add realism to his new porno character Orgazmo and also the gimmick of an innocent Mormon in a porno could get good publicity.  Despite his beliefs Joe agrees but when one film turns into another Joe finds he is trapped in porn  where will it all end?,/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2012,planktonrules,3," A pretty stupid movie--and I don't mean that as a compliment.
","This movie stars Trey Parker and was co-written by him. So, I expected it to be crude and offensive (and it was). However, I also expected it to be really funny, as Parker's other projects (""South Park"", ""Cannibal the Musical"", ""BASEketball"" and ""Team America: World Police"") are brilliant and hilarious. Sadly, the film mostly just succeeds in being very offensive--but not at all funny. It's a film filled with potentially funny situations but few punchlines or laughs.",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 1999,nunculus,," Second-best movie about a naive kid in the porn industry
","Cheesily made but undeniably funny movie by SOUTH PARK auteur Trey Parker, in which a proselytizing Mormon (played by Parker) is wooed into the adult-film business. In the hands of Alexander Payne, this would be a dry Bunuelian jeremiad. In the hands of Parker, it has a coarse but sincere appeal. For late-night, post-six-beers cable-watching only.",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2007,hall895,4," Well, what were you expecting?
","So, when you hear that Trey Parker of South Park fame wrote, directed and starred in a comedy set in the world of porn you had to think this would be a movie that had the potential to be excruciatingly bad. Then as you watch it you may be pleasantly surprised for the first half hour or so and think this isn't so bad. But then as the movie drags on you'll find yourself thinking that, yeah, this is pretty bad after all. But it could have been worse.",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2004,tedg,," I'm not a Superhero, I'm a Latter Day Saint!
","There's a difference between a joke and the idea of a joke. The idea of a nun demolition derby (no cars) is much more engaging than any actual cinematic expression of it. Most funny ideas are like this. On the other hand, the South Park episode where a kid wants pubes so buys them is so much funnier in its expression than its idea.",/review/rw0986169/?ref_=tt_urv
