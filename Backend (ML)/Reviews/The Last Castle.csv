","It was a good movie spoiled by bad writing. How many times does one have to hear ""go-go-go"" , ""you okay"", ""u gonna be ok"", ""sure about this?""; staring at impending disaster instead of running, taking the wrong turn and again staring at things.
Don't kill English and make another cliche bits stuck into a action movie",/review/rw3359193/?ref_=tt_urv

They meet other survivors from other mazes and they learn that everyday, a group of teenagers is summoned to be lodged in farms and communities in safe areas. However Thomas decides to investigate what happens with the teenagers and he meets Aris Jones (Jacob Lofland). Soon they find that the place is a WCKD facility and Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) is alive and the leader of experiments with the teenagers that are intubated neither alive nor dead.

18 November 2015,grandmastersik,4," Vapid sequel that raises serious questions about the point of the first film
","If you're a teenager looking for some adventure that isn't all ""dark"" and ""gritty"" - the buzz words of films nowadays - then you may enjoy this. If, however, you can't stop asking WHY? constantly, then you'll most likely end up hating it.",/review/rw3359193/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2015,TheOny13,1," Spends most of its time setting up the conclusion...
","First of all, I didn't want to go and see this movie especially because I saw the first part and while I was watching it I was really interested in knowing why they were tested in the maze or who Thomas and Teresa were, what they did before they were cast out into the maze, etc... but unfortunately I got none of this answers, but what I did get were a lot more mysteries but no answers, but it's not like LOST where it leaves the audience thinking and putting things together and finding out the mysteries, but it's more of a dull and predictable mysteries every time they have some of the main characters talk to each other.",/review/rw3359193/?ref_=tt_urv

","To begin with, I have to let you know that I was not aware of the existence of any book before I saw the first and second movie. So, comments like ""you ruined the book"", etc. don't make sense to me. ",/review/rw3359193/?ref_=tt_urv

7 April 2020,lukem-52760,8," AN AWESOME & EXCITING APOCALYPTIC SCI-FI THRILLER
","The Maze Runner films are an Awesome Trilogy & i think i like this part ""The Scorch Trials"" best.
Here Thomas & his crew are on the run into the dangerous desert wastelands called The Scorched Earth, a place full of Danger & most dangerous of all are the Infected humans who have turned into Zombie creatures called Cranks. These ""Cranks"" look Awesome & make for terrifying creatures that are out there ready to rip-apart any human. This film has a more Horror feel to it & that's why i loved it best. There's an incredible, intense & exciting sequence where Thomas & his gang are in a buried building in the sand & it's dark & scary & full of ferocious killer Cranks that chase them through the big old building/Mall type place & it's so intense & scary & a proper Horror movie scene.
The characters are all great again here, especially Thomas as the troubled leader of the group & we get, much later in the movie, a great Little role from Barry Pepper, one of the most underrated actors out there & one of my personal favourite actors ever!!! Here the always intense & rugged Barry Pepper plays a tough wasteland warrior named Vince & although it's a small part for Pepper it's a great role & he steals the show as soon as he's on screen.
Here Thomas must survive the scorched earth & evade the evil WKD empire. A thrilling adventure.",/review/rw3359193/?ref_=tt_urv

9 September 2015,prospectus_capricornium,6," Less A-Maze-ing than the First Installment
","Last year's 'The Maze Runner' was en route to a non-conformist course off the young adult/post-apocalyptic sub-genre, delivering less familiar but appealing deviations from the more recognizable standards of the category. This year, 'The Scorch Trials', its sequel, keeps some of the original beats of its predecessor, but it eventually falls into the scope of the overly familiar trope that the first film has defiantly avoided, which is a bit disappointing, considering the riveting buildup they've pulled off with the first film.",/review/rw3359193/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2020,camoudemers,9," Great amazing movie!
","So, lets just talk about how amazing the movie is? Idk why people are hating on this movie! James did an amazing job writing and the producer of the movie did too because he included terrific scenes in the book into a mild-terrific scene. Also, I think that it was like a little bit simple (zombie apocalypse). The scorch Trials was better than the first movie. If you watch this movie, you will be amazed! The actors played they role perfectly. I rate this movie 9/10 just because they made Teresa evil and she betrayed her friends :(",/review/rw3359193/?ref_=tt_urv

30 October 2015,Robert_duder,7," An awful lot of harsh criticism for a teen-adventure flick
","Maze Runner is NOT Hunger Games. It could be described as a poor man's version of The Hunger Games. Originally when the first one released, I didn't really care to see it but when I finally watched the first one I was very pleased. It was actually a lot of fun. It's simple and has a slight moral message but the action and intrigue and characters were all very good. So now I was a fan enough to look forward to the second one. I will say that I think they definitely rushed Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials. They were too caught up in the release one instalment every year idea. The Scorch Trials feels completely different in a lot of ways from the first film. I have not read the books so I can't speak to the similarities but it sounds like readers hate the movie. From an entertainment standpoint, The Scorch Trials is decent. Its still well acted though I think they could have developed the characters a little more because now it feels like this is all about special effects and monsters and the extended post-apocalyptic world. There are some great twists and turns and some interesting plot points so it is far from a total loss.",/review/rw3359193/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2015,3xHCCH,7," Rogues, Rebels and Zombies!
","Almost exactly one year ago, the first ""Maze Runner"" film was released in local theaters. I thought that the action sequences within the maze scenes were all quite exciting and very entertaining to watch. However, after all the excellent suspense and tension built up in the first two- thirds of the film, at the end nothing really gets explained clearly. It felt like an incomplete film on its own. For those it gets interested though, this sequel is expected to give answers to questions raised in the first film.",/review/rw3359193/?ref_=tt_urv

",I massively enjoyed it was completely locked in from the beginning. I really really enjoyed the first one and I was concerned if this would compare as it came out only a year later but it definitely did and it definitely deserves an 8. The characters are really likeable which you don't normally get from younger actors. Special effects were class to.,/review/rw3359193/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2015,kuuk3,8," Superb sets, great action if not a bit too long.
","This film has everything from sandstorms and lightning to Zombies and evil henchman.
