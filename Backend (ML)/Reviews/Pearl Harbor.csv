14 January 2023,jmillerjr-00983,9," Exactly what I paid for
","Here was a movie that delivered exaxtly what I paid for. I went on a Friday night. Got a burger and a beer at the bar next to the theater, then got to watch a perfect Friday night movie. We need more of these types of films. Thrilling, edge of your seat action. Cool characters. Beautiful women. Dangerous bad guys. I think the important thing is not to over think it. Gerald Butler was perfect for the role. I could have seen Harrison Ford play this part well 30 years ago. Mike Colter was great as well. Looking forward to more with him. Overall, this one is definitely worth your time if you want a action 101 Friday night flick.",/review/rw8807609/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,benjaminskylerhill,7," Surprisingly white-knuckle
","Yeah, it's constructed entirely out of familiar parts, without a single groundbreaking or original element. But Plane is able to fly above its generic ground by making the most of its actors and inherently tension-rich premise.",/review/rw8807609/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2023,RedandBlueBulldog,7," Thank You For Flying Trailblazer Airlines
","This is a lean and yet solid 7 star shopping mall cinema action film starring the ultimate.throwback shopping mall cinema action hero, the modern day Gerard Butler. Not 300 Gerard Butler. The Gerard Butler now. Gerard Butler 2023, here equal parts Snake Plissken and Ben from Leaving Las Vegas. Unshaven, puffy and pale. I don't know if I want him flying my airplane but I still love him even after all these years, and I'm along for another ride. Heck, I even got frequent flyer miles.",/review/rw8807609/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2023,FeastMode,5," A 90s throwback, but I wish it was better
","Plane reminds me of the action movies of my youth. Most 90s action movies are pretty bad by today's standards, but I don't mind going back to the feel of those movies, modernized and updated to the latest action standards. Plane does this fairly successfully, yet still falters when it comes to making a good overall movie.",/review/rw8807609/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,movies_are_life_,8," Well-paced action that is fun!
",Some movies are meant to have a simple fun time with. No need to try to be more than what they are. Inaccuracies can be ignored since this movie wears its identity on its sleeve. It's the inaccuracies and straight to the point filmmaking that tells the audience that you're in for a good time. Don't take it too seriously.,/review/rw8807609/?ref_=tt_urv

",The CG isn't convincing but that can't stop Plane from being a great 90s throwback that knows exactly how to execute all the expected genre tropes in fun and satisfying fashion and further proves that leading man Gerard Butler is the current king of B movies.,/review/rw8807609/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,mpn1967,8," Exactly what you expect, and that's a good thing.
","""Plane"" offers exactly what you think it's going to, not straying far-if at all-from familiar action movies like ""Under Siege"" or previous Butler characters like Mike Bannon. It's a well paced movie, roughly broken into 3 acts. But, for me, it's a surprisingly short movie. Just a little over an hour and half. I actually wished there were another 30 minutes to really flesh out the story and the characters, plus adding even more action. Gerard Butler is his usual solid, tough guy self and the addition of of Mike Colter (Luke Cage!) make the movie a really solid action duo. It's a light movie, but doesn't pretend to be something that its not. So, just sit back and enjoy the flight.",/review/rw8807609/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,statuskuo,5," Closer to ""Plain""
","""Plane"" is such a lackluster movie with so many parts that seem...missing. You get the sense that there is a more flushed out movie here IF it was shuffled around differently. And that makes for a very frustrating viewing. The trailer pitch seemed to be a these two men on the poster who team to take on baddies. In reality, they spend a small window of time together, but more importantly don't have moments to breathe. A simple solution would be to clue us in on more of the criminal. Yes, much was given away in the trailer. He isn't a bad man. But what we discover as watching is...he isn't even a tough guy at all. Which makes it quite odd to watch him dispatch Filipino separtists (something they mention more times than you care to know). I think it was a mashing of a few cinema tropes. For instance, when the plane does go down, they cut away to the headquarters of Trailblazer Airlines which attempts to do damage control. This is taken from something like ""Under Siege"" or ""Air Force One"". If they were to steal from this, why not make Gerard Butler's character much more...deep. Instead, he isn't made to be very interesting. At some points I found myself asking ""What would Liam Neeson do here?"" Yeah, it falls under that category.",/review/rw8807609/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,demonblade-37792,7," Search and Rescue
","Plane is a good action film filled with intense acting, gunshots, fights, and story. The story goes along with Captain Brodie Torrance (Gerard Butler) flying his crew and passengers on an airplane with an dangerous criminal, Louis Gaspare (Mike Colter) on board. When they fly into international waters that everything does not go according to plan. A violent storm strikes the plane causing them to land in a remote island somewhere in the Philippines filled with armed rebels. Brodie Torrance, Gaspare, and the military must rescue and escape with the crew and passengers before everything goes wrong. Overall, I liked it for what it is that a plane crash goes wrong and has to rescue everyone safely from the rebels. Also, Gerard Butler does not miss with his action films in this one. It is a good watch in theaters for a good action start in 2023.",/review/rw8807609/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,paul_haakonsen,6," Good old fashioned enjoyable action thriller...

15 January 2023,ColinTheGorilla,6," Pretty Fun
",I really enjoyed this movie as it had some awesome action moments throughout the film and I truly did enjoy it. Gerard Butler was a badass in this movie and I really enjoyed the character of his but oh my god does Mike Colters character takes the cake as my favorite part of this movie as he was such a badass and a super fun character to watch and enjoy. Overall I thought this movie had so many awesome action moments and I think it's worth the watch whenever you've got some time because its such a fun action movie that I think people should see. It's overall just an enjoyful movie and I believe people should go see this.,/review/rw8807609/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,Xstal,4," Full Throttle (and Some)...
","If you can ignore all the nonsense and absurd, close your eyes and make the world a little blurred, suspend belief (almost all), accept in full, do not hesitate to mull, take your reasoning, then make sure it's transferred. To be fair, there's not a lot of film left once you've done that.",/review/rw8807609/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,jp_91,3," A movie with nothing new to offer.
","""Plane"" is the first film production to be released in theaters this 2023 and the result is not favorable. ""Plane"" does not offer anything new, a recycled script full of clichés and predictable scenes, it only becomes interesting during the first minutes in terms of the plane sequences that are reminiscent of disaster genre movies. The performances do their job without any additional merit, plus the director's work seems barely to exist. The cinematography is conventional without any appeal. The soundtrack goes completely unnoticed. The action scenes are bland and in some scenes the digital effects are quite unreal. A bad movie that fails to take off.",/review/rw8807609/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,imseeg,5," Boring first half hour. So so middle part. Great action packed final.
","The bad: This movie has got a really slow start. After 15 minutes some action, but not very good action, with little suspense and little credibility.",/review/rw8807609/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2023,cadillac20,5," Incredibly average in every single way
","Gerard Butler has had a bit of a tough go since 300 made him a household name. That movie remains his most iconic, with him seeming to flounder a bit around a whole bunch of action roles and some against type films that fared even worse. Here, we see him once again in action mode and it's sad to see that it's yet another disposable action flick in which he gets to play the hero in a subpar action film.",/review/rw8807609/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,Nixon_Carmichael,7," Plane embraces the olde school 1990s action movie vibe. This movie rules.
","Plane comes from French director Jean Francois Richet (Assault on Precinct 13) and stars Gerard Butler and Mike Coulter. This movie just works, with no shaky cam and minimal but seething score behind it, Plane rumbles right through at a taught 1:47, and I just got a huge kick out of it.",/review/rw8807609/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2023,dmerette,10," Great Ride!
","This started out strong, and stayed that way the whole time. This is the movie that could. All the actors did a great job. The suspense was awesome! I was like 'Oh God, please make it!"" I was at the edge of my seat most of the time and couldn't stop watching. The time flew by and I wanted more when it ended. This movie is what a movie should be, entertaining, no wasted time and I feel emotions while I'm watching and just lovin' every minute. The action is non stop more or less, and the fighting seems so real I wanted to stand up yelling ""Yeah!!! Kick his a**!"" I just had so much fun while watching this movie and I think everyone should go see it.",/review/rw8807609/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,A_Different_Drummer,7," Butler always gives his best
","Butler is part of a generations of action heroes, perhaps a bit long in the tooth now, who simply do not know how to give a weak performance. There is nothing new about the story, but the pacing is interesting. The director could have turned this into a race, a mistake too many actioners make, trying to constantly hype the audience with new thrills. Instead, the whole film is done more slowly, which in this cases makes the story feel that much more personal. A half hour into it, not a lot has happened but the audience starts to feel like they too are on that plane... and wish they were not. Overall a perfect film to keep you entertained for an overseas flight ... unless of course you have an overactive imagination. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

14 January 2023,jellyneckr,," Plane is plain
","Like with Liam Neeson, Gerard Butler's recent filmography is its own subgenre: the dad who has to step up and save the day despite impossibly incredible, unrealistic odds. While Liam Neeson is unquestionably the better actor, Butler has found his niche as the action star in a super specific type of genre picture. Plane, his latest entry in this category, is neither the best nor the worst of Butler's. It is, however, probably the most average.",/review/rw8807609/?ref_=tt_urv
