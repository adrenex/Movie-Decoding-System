7 February 2015,Lejink,7," Good food guide
","I'm no foodie but I really enjoyed this road-trip / father-son / buddy movie, written directed by and starring Jon Favreau, based on the recent life and times of a perfectionist chef who struggles to suppress his own innovation to the demands of his conservative paymaster boss. More than this, he gets involved in a spat with the town's number 1 food critic, sees his relationship with his son founder under pressure of work and still pines after his glamorous and super-rich ex-wife.",/review/rw3050825/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2014,jk-692-236394,9," Happy, Uplifting, Feel Good Movie
","I did not expect such a talented cast of actors mostly in small parts. Jon Favearu has a lot of friends. The actor who played his son is a find. He was great. Low key, sweet and very natural and believable. The story is good. It is about the chef and then the food truck, but it really is about him and his son. I liked that he was friends with his ex wife, Sofia Vergara, who did a great job. That struck home for me, because my ex and I get along well and it brought a lump to my throat to see how happy that made their son. It is special when divorced parents can get along and do things with their kids. The story moved quickly and I loved how the son used twitter and they incorporated social media into the story. Very realistic. I highly recommend this movie. Really a joy to watch.",/review/rw3050825/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2014,Laakbaar,8," You won't want to miss this one
","I really enjoyed this funny and heart-warming movie about a chef and his relationship with food and his son. The film is worth about 8.5 in my books. The current IMDb score is roughly accurate, despite the inexplicably negative reviews and voting of a tiny minority.",/review/rw3050825/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2015,tr91,9," I loved it
",Jon Favreau is Chef Carl Casper working in a restaurant for a boss he doesn't see eye to eye with. He ends up leaving his job after he becomes fed up with the menu and receiving some bad criticism from a food critic. He exchanges insults with the food critic via Twitter and of course it goes viral and Carl's reputation is really on the line. He's also having some problems with his own personal life after he and his wife split and he is trying to build a relationship with his young son. The story follows Carl as he looks to get his career back on track and build stronger bonds with his loved ones.,/review/rw3050825/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2015,brchthethird,8," An immensely satisfying treat
","As I've been exposing myself to new types of movies and different filmmakers, I sometimes feel like I'm trying new food. CHEF, directed by and starring Jon Favreau, was a delightful little indie ""dish"" and an immensely satisfying treat. It's about a chef, Carl Casper (Favreau), who works for this French restaurant. One night a critic (Oliver Platt) comes in and later posts a scathing review on Twitter that goes viral. Carl, a little bit new to social media, inadvertently starts a flame war with the critic and challenges him to come back because he'll cook the menu he wanted to cook the first time around. Things don't end up going so well, and Carl leaves his job as chef and takes his ex-wife's (Sofia Vergara) advice about starting a food truck. Narratively, the film is somewhat divided. The first third or so is more of a traditional ""food"" movie with some relationship drama thrown in, but at a critical point the film shifts gears into a road trip movie. Structure aside, I thought that they did a great job balancing the food aspects (which looked amazing) and the character relationships. The key relationship is between Carl and his son, who comes along with him on his food truck journey. It was really great to see how the relationship changed and improved over the course of the film. Something should also be said for the cast. Although most of them have relatively small roles, Favreau was able to call in some favors and get Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr., Dustin Hoffman, Oliver Platt, Bobby Cannavale, John Leguizamo and Sofia Vergara to appear here. Even though most of these people only appear in the first half when Carl works at the restaurant (and are therefore dropped once the narrative switches gear), it was still nice to see them. I thought they all gave excellent performances, even for such small roles. The only iffy member of the cast was the boy who plays Carl's son who, at times, seemed like a blank slate. Maybe that was intentional? I don't know, but he also is a child actor so I won't make too big a deal out of it. The only other aspect of the movie I find fault with is the way in which the film ends, which I won't spoil here. All I'll say about it is that it was a little TOO nice and clean. That being said, I thought that CHEF really worked on an emotional level. Overall, it might not be the best film I've ever seen, but it had a feelgood atmosphere, great dialogue and some great cooking. Bon appetit!",/review/rw3050825/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2014,basil1984,," Food-porn at its best
","Jon Favreau's pet project, after a decade of big budget, heavy-on-special-effects, blockbusters and fantasy fair, is as charming as they come. The film follows a master chef (played by Favreau) whose career is derailed and, as a last resort, opens a food truck and drives across country with his young son and his sous-chef, played by John Leguizamo, selling Cubano sandwiches. Along the way, we're treated to food-porn at its best and introduced to a cast of characters that would make Woody Allen blush: Oliver Platt, Dustin Hoffman, Sofia Vergara, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansen, and a slew of other familiar faces.",/review/rw3050825/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2014,thirteenprime,8," Tasty!
","I can't help feeling that this movie is not only about a chef finding himself, but it's also about lead actor/director Jon Favreau trying to get back in touch with the kind of films he used to make -- small ones without guys wearing super-suits or cowboys drawing down on aliens. Here, Favreau's Carl Casper quits his big Iron Restaurant job and rediscovers himself, and his passion for food and family, by running a Chef-sized food truck. Results: excellent.",/review/rw3050825/?ref_=tt_urv

3 June 2016,kosmasp,8," Kiss the cook
","I have no idea why anyone would call this movie by this title. But the German distributor thought it would be a perfect fit, so who am I to argue? Another thing that cannot be argued with, is the passion Jon Favreau went after this. Learning the trades of being a chef and really going into as much detail as he deemed necessary. He did not take this lightly, which can be seen throughout.",/review/rw3050825/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2014,mistercsays1,8," Look Who's Cooking
","Stepping away from the blockbusters that have occupied his time and talents of late, Jon Favreau scales back the spectacle to deliver Chef, a thoroughly enjoyable story of redemption set amid the chaos and camaraderie of the kitchen in which Favreau delivers what may be his best performance yet. In addition to taking on the lead role of disgruntled chef Carl Casper, Favreau also wrote the screenplay and served as producer and director, putting himself firmly in the firing line if the film misfired. Fortunately, he has got most of it right and Chef overcomes any shortcomings through its refreshing take on relationships - particularly between Carl and his 10-year-old son Percy (Emjay Anthony) - and the power of technology and social media as both a destructive force and an instrument of considerable social currency. Confined to bit parts of late in the likes of The Wolf of Wall Street and the three Iron Man films, Favreau seems to relish the opportunity to take on this role of a man forced to re-evaluate everything that is important to him.",/review/rw3050825/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2014,maha-albadrawi,8," A familiar recipe, expertly prepared and served with extra zest!
","At an early point in Chef, the title character cooks a grilled cheese sandwich for his 10-year-old son, Percy. It's a familiar recipe —bread, butter, and cheese — but the way that the camera lingers on the melting cheese, and the care taken in how the food was served, made me want to reach into the screen and take a bite. If Chef were a meal, it would be comfort food. When comfort food is done right, boy oh boy does it hit the spot. ",/review/rw3050825/?ref_=tt_urv

7 September 2014,Morpheus911,8," A Great Father and Son Movie
","I guess some people thought this movie was long and boring. Even some said acting was kind of bad. Well I think the total opposite of this. And I cannot see why anyone would think otherwise. This movie as basic as the plots and story lines were, totally kept my interest. I think it's Jon Favreau's best movie ever. It's a masterpiece. This could be a cult classic for Father's Day, like It's A Wonderful Life is for Christmas. Of course the general sway of Hollywood shun's on a great family life. However Jon Fav didn't give a crap and he decided to celebrate how to celebrate living again. Yeah not much going on but if you don't feel good after watching this then you have a crusty heart and your problems have deep rooted issues. ",/review/rw3050825/?ref_=tt_urv

","CHEF (2014) ***1/2 Jon Favreau, Sofia Vergara, John Leguizamo, Bobby Cannavale, Emjay Anthony, Robert Downey, Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Dustin Hoffman, Oliver Platt, Amy Sedaris. Funny and warm-hearted comedy with Favreau (who wrote and directed and a return-to-form- with-his-indie-roots) as the titular artiste de culinary who finds a mid-life crises when his creative desires to break free from his stable but unhappy job in a tony LA eatery leads to embarking on a new venture in the unlikely form of a food truck dishing out Cuban cuisine for the working class. Amiably ambling along at a fine clip with enough food porn for the least- interested in the subject and mouth-watering designs for those who crave some new juice in the familiar domestic comedy with father/son bonding over good eats. Anthony as the sharply observant son is a natural while the fine ensemble keeps things lively namely Leguizamo as Fav's aide-de-camp sous chef and Vergara as his comely ex. Better than leftovers.",/review/rw3050825/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2015,g-bodyl,10," A Very Tasty Film!
","Pardon my pun, but I found Chef to be such an appetizing entrée that delivers upon which the aromas promised. Chef takes director Jon Favreau into the indie world where he began, and he delivers one of the best films of 2014. Not only is this a satisfying movie, it's a movie that makes the actual food look delicious! I am in the mood for a Cuban sandwich now. What I really liked about the film is how it is actually a heartfelt father/son story with pure characterization instead of a movie just about the food. The food does add some exotic flavoring though.",/review/rw3050825/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2014,richard-1787,3," Very much a feel-good movie, so beware if you don't like them

9 May 2014,TheMovieVlog,8," I loved this movie. It was funny, sweet and totally entertaining. A feel good movie.
","Writer/Director/Star Jon Favreau made an auspicious writing/acting debut back in 1996 with the cultural touchstone, SWINGERS. Since then, he has moved smack dab into the middle of mainstream studio filmmaking with such megahits as ELF and IRON MAN. Perhaps as a way to reconnect with his indie roots, Favreau brings us CHEF, the story of a man tired of working for ""the man"" who strikes out on his own with a food truck and strives to forge a better relationship with his young son. If this sounds like conventional stuff, it is. It's also charming and lazy in equal measure. ",/review/rw3050825/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2014,KineticSeoul,4," Lacks the sizzle and flavor
","This movie just lacked that sizzle and flavor to merit a watch. It's just predictable and narrow movie that doesn't have any surprise to it. As a matter of fact the movie ""The Five-Year Engagement"" which doesn't even revolve around the cooking much was better than this flick. Watching this movie, you won't feel like your being treated for a cuisine but a fast-food instead. So the movie is about a passionate and yet very pride and sensitive chef that goes on a mediocre and forgettable journey to find himself and what is really important to him. He is a good guy though and cares for his family. Everything is just mediocre at best and forgettable and that includes the dialogue as well. The thing is, the movie seems to focus more on bonding than actually focusing in on the cooking elements. Yeah, it's not Iron Chef or Hell's Kitchen, but it would be nice with a movie that has the title ""Chef"" to focus a bit more on the chef elements. Overall, this one just bore the heck out of me.",/review/rw3050825/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2014,oscaralbert,9," See CHEF for a savory blend . . .
",". . . of appetite-engendering food visuals, father & son bonding, frequent star cameos, and a Smurf of a different color. Seldom does a single dad get much respect in Hollywood flicks, unless he's the sole surviving parent on the run from international bad guys. Chef's title character, Carl, is an exception to this norm. Carl's apparent joint custody of winsome 10-year-old son Percy is tenuous at best when this story begins, but strong as a jalapeño by CHEF's close. As might be expected, Carl's social media skills expand accordingly as he devotes more time and attention to his only child. To prove that he's finally getting his priorities straight, Carl basically ditches Scarlet Johansson for Percy. (In real life, there probably are fathers who would NOT make such a substitution.) Part road-trip flick, but a journey toward Carl's self-actualization as well, CHEF also joins BIG NIGHT, BABETTE'S FEAST, ROMANTICS ANONYMOUS, and RATATOUILLE near the top of the food movies listing. Perhaps lacking the drama of FRIED GREEN TOMATOES, WAITRESS, or THE COOK THE THIEF THE WIFE & HER LOVER, CHEF still hits a sweet spot on the palate in its own right.",/review/rw3050825/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2015,ahegde3149,5," Wish the story was as scrumptious as the food
",I did not know what to expect from Chef considering Jon Favreau previous work being the blockbuster superhero Iron Man franchise. Here the glamorous talents of Scarlett Johanson and Robert Downey Jr. (from the same Iron Man series) are shockingly wasted with poor dialogues and unimaginative writing. Still Jon somehow carries the film on his own shoulders making me consider it as commendable effort.,/review/rw3050825/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2014,bbewnylorac,8," Lovely film
","The script, directing and acting of Chef are all very tight and entertaining. I did love this film. It's a simple but strong plot -- top chef Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) gets publicly humiliated on social media when LA's top food blogger, Ramsey Michel (Oliver Platt) gives him a scathing review. Unwisely, but hilariously, a hot-headed Casper publicly retaliates, ending his job at the restaurant and leading to him setting up a food truck in Miami with his 10 year old son and best friend helping out. Jon Favreau, while an unconventional leading man, is appealing and convincing as a chef for whom his work is everything. The supporting actors, from Dustin Hoffman as the restaurant owner, to Scarlett Johansson as Carl's friend and maitre d', John Leguizamo and Bobby Cannavale as fellow chefs and Robert Downey Junior as Carl's ex- wife's ex-husband, are all great. Emjay Anthony, as Carl's son Percy, deserves special mention as a child actor who comes across as very natural, and as obviously having a ball taking part in this movie. Even Oliver Platt as the food reviewer puts in a funny performance as the dweeb who has the power to ruin Carl's career. And to the writers' credit, he's not totally portrayed as the bad guy; he is just doing his job and other factors contributed to Carl's downfall. The only questionable note in the film was casting Sofia Vergara as Carl's ex-wife, Inez. Vergara is certainly gorgeous to look at, and she acts well as a loving mother to Percy and still affectionate friend to Carl. But in every scene she looks dazzling -- like she's just stepped out of a beauty parlour, perfectly made-up, dressed for an awards night and not a hair out of place. I felt it was just too much; it was like she belonged more in a Vogue photo shoot rather than in this quite down to earth film narrative. Only in a later scene does she pitch in on the food van and actually wear something realistic.",/review/rw3050825/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2014,MCMAYNERBERRY,1," Frustratingly straightforward, simplistic and just plain unengaging

17 August 2014,cosmo_tiger,9," A movie that I really enjoyed and highly recommend. Just a feel good movie that isn't cheesy. There needs to be more of these.
","""That review went viral."" Carl Casper (Favreau) is the best chef in the city working at the best restaurant. On the night that a respected food critic is coming Carl decides to change the menu and do something different to show off his skills. The owner of the restaurant doesn't like that idea and Carl is forced to abandon his ideas. When the critic gives him a bad review it hits the internet. Carl decides to respond and a war of words culminates in a confrontation that ends up with Carl out of a job. When a trip to Miami provides a new opportunity Carl and his son discover something more important then food. I have been a Favreau fan since Swingers. That was really the last movie he was in where he was the main star (even though in that and Made Vince Vaughn really stole the movies). After seeing this I wouldn't be surprised if he got more starring roles. He is perfect for this movie. He really just plays Mike, grown up, with a little more confidence. That is not a bad thing at all. The movie is full of comedy, heart and is so entertaining and enjoyable to watch that the movie moves along almost too fast and you wish there was more. This is a movie I could go an and on about but I will just say watch this. I really enjoyed it. Overall, a movie that I really enjoyed and highly recommend. Just a feel good movie that isn't cheesy.

","I heard the hype, noted the IMDb ultra-high rating and expected a cool, indie, cinema moment. That never happened for me. Some have gone on and on about all the mouth watering 'foods.' Actually, aside from a sub-par wannabe gourmet meal served to food critic (Oliver Platt) there were sparse full screen gourmet mouth watering moments. Most of the film dealt with roadie 'sandwiches.' Yes, sandwiches... things slapped between two slices of bread and which you will never find in any gourmet restaurant kitchen.",/review/rw3050825/?ref_=tt_urv
