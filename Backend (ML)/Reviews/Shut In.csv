9 June 2018,paul_haakonsen,6," Non-stop gags...
","Normally I am not overly keen on the movies that Sacha Baron Cohen stars in, because he is fairly singular and monotonous in his movies. As in if you've seen one of his movies, you have essentially seen all.",/review/rw3437736/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2017,SnoopyStyle,6," mix bag of outrageous humor
",Nobby Butcher (Sacha Baron Cohen) is an idiot football hooligan from Grimsby and has 11 children with Dawn (Rebel Wilson). He is looking to reconnect with estranged brother Sebastian Graves (Mark Strong). Sebastian is now a gunman for an MI6 offshoot. His investigation leads to actress philanthropist Rhonda George (Penelope Cruz). Nobby's interference causes Sebastian to be blamed for an assassination. Sebastian is forced to team up with his secret brother Nobby.,/review/rw3437736/?ref_=tt_urv

5 April 2016,jtindahouse,9," The man knows funny
","I'm a big Sacha Baron Cohen fan. I particularly love him in his documentary-style movies where he uses real people in each scenes and plays his character around them. He's now proved with both 'The Dictator' and 'Grimsby' that he can write very well in the standard comedy style as well. The thing I like most about his films is that nothing is off limits. Any thing can be said, any event can happen and no one is safe from his ridicule. There is one scene in 'Grimsby' that is particularly offensive and shocking to watch. I had seen a clip on Jimmy Kimmel's show where the audience were seen reacting to this scene (a very clever marketing ploy) and now I can fully understand their disgust and discomfort at what they were watching. He pushed it to the limit with that one.",/review/rw3437736/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2016,Lugodoc,10," Either Raises Or Lowers The Bar On Filth
","Good Lord this is filthy, and I laughed right through it, sometimes crying tears. I can totally see why some people would hate it, many scenes are hard to watch. The ""plot"" cracks along and the jokes are pretty much continuous, and filthy. Mark Strong not only makes a convincing James Bond type secret agent but is as equally committed to embracing the film's sense of humour, following Cohen into new filthy territory. Cohen, as usual, has no internal breaks and doesn't seem to be even trying to figure out where he should stop, he just keeps piling on the filth to levels hitherto undreamed of. The elephant bukake scene nearly broke me.",/review/rw3437736/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2021,Kdosda_Hegen,6," Hardcore comedy for adults.
","This film is nuts. It's so hardcore, perverted and sick that I would not recommend it to most people. But the ones who love hardcore perverted films once in a while will have a treat with this one.",/review/rw3437736/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2016,cosmo_tiger,7," There are some scenes in this movie I can never un-see. That being said...I really really enjoyed this and recommend it.
","""We're the butcher boys of Grimsby. They'll never split us up."" Sebastian (Strong) is an undercover assassin who is the best at what he does. His brother Nobby (Cohen) is not as smart, but loves his wife and family. The two haven't seen each other in many many years so when Nobby finally locates him he is incredibly happy, but when he messes up an attempt by Sebastian to save someone both brothers are instantly wanted by the police. Now, Nobby and Sebastian must out run the law, and find a way to save the world. This is a movie I was very worried about. Cohen, to me, is very hit or miss. I though Borat was funny, hated Bruno, loved The Dictator, and the previews for this movie didn't really get me excited to watch it. After seeing this I understood why the previews were the way they are, most of this movie is so over the top and offensive pretty much the only things they could show were in the previews. There are some scenes in this movie I can never un- see. That being said...I really really enjoyed this. I watched it alone and laughed out loud over and over again, while at the same time turning away and watching through my fingers. Cohen has a history of pushing the envelope and he really holds nothing back in this one. Overall, hilarious and extremely over the top and offensive, if you are easily offended skip this one. I thought it was great and for those that can handle it without getting upset I would recommend it. I very surprisingly give this a B+.",/review/rw3437736/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2016,larrys3,4," Incredibly Raunchy & Silly Yet I Laughed at Times
","Incredibly raunchy and silly, although it's hard for me to admit, I found myself laughing out loud a number of times during the movie. Warning: the elephant scene, as other reviewers have mentioned, could keep you grossed out and ruin your appetite for the next few weeks, or months.",/review/rw3437736/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2022,vinnieboards,7," Sickening, Depraved, Disgusting and ... Hilarious!
","Sacha Baron Cohen has ploughed a career as a divisive and controversial figure in the comedy world. From Ali G to Borat, Cohen has proven adept at satirising popular's themes. Cohen's humour often exceeds the limits of good taste whilst conning ordinary people into revealing their abhorrent views in mockumentary style.",/review/rw3437736/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2016,paul-2369,9," Not laughed so much at the cinema since the parole officer
","Went to watch Grimsby last night on a whim and ended up having a great time. Not everyone's cup of tea I'm sure, but surely anyone going to see this new Sacha Baron Cohen film knows exactly what they are going to get.",/review/rw3437736/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2021,BrnzReviews,9," Grimsby Is A Funny One!
","This was a great movie, such a funny watch Sacha Baron Cohen is definately in my top 10 when it comes to comedy. I enjoyed the parts of the mi6 that were shown the effects were incredible! As for the comedy.. Oh boy some moments caught me off guard and left me in stitches.",/review/rw3437736/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2016,kosmasp,5," Love it or hate it
","And I'm not telling you what to do, I'm kind of telling you what possibilities are after watching this. It is very likely that it won't leave you cold. It's almost impossible to not have strong feelings towards what you will get served. And all that with something that stretches the word ""quality"" so wide, you could fit a ton of (insert something to your liking here) ... Does that sound like something you want to see? It apparently sounded like something Mark Strong wanted to be a part of.",/review/rw3437736/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2016,mlaimlai2,8," There's nothing grim about ""Grimsby""
","The funniest movie for at least a year! Sacha Baron Cohen at the top of his game. Rude, crude, filthy, but absolutely hilarious with numerous laugh-out-loud moments. So many laughs in fact that I found myself wiping away the tears from laughing so much. It certainly helps if you are a Sacha Baron Cohen fan because he is politically incorrect and his humour is guaranteed to offend anyone who is sensitive to issues like AIDS, religion, sexual abuse and the disabled. Of course comedy is so subjective that you mightn't find any of this funny but I had such a fun time, I cannot wait to see it again to check out the jokes I might have missed out the first time around from laughing too much.

12 March 2016,StevePulaski,3," What happens when a once-brave comedian conforms to mainstream standards
","If anyone has had a hard time adapting their schtick to the modern times, it's Sacha Baron Cohen. The fearless comedian who brought his wickedly funny, but culturally relevant, stereotypes of white rappers, foreigners, and flamboyant homosexuals to life in hilarious passion projects has found it difficult to adapt in the age of YouTube/cellphones, where similar acts of pranking the public are aplenty online. While the formula has still proved successful (IE: ""Bad Grandpa""), Cohen's more elaborate methods are of a bygone era, it seems, which is why all of his characters are ""retired,"" so he claims. Since 2012, with the release of ""The Dictator,"" his first formally structure film, Cohen has been trying to adapt his schtick to more scripted ventures (or ""real"" films, some will say), with plots, characters, and actual conflicts.",/review/rw3437736/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2019,gridoon2023,5," First you'll rub your eyes, then you'll need to wash them
","An elephantine (get it?) exercise in shock comedy: offensive, disgusting, lower-than-low, but frenetic and not boring at the very least. There is a breathtaking first-person POV action sequence at the start, and you will laugh at certain times, but you'll probably be too ashamed to recommend the picture to anyone. Most unrealistic thing about it: England reaching the final of, let alone winning, the World Cup in football. LoL. ** out of 4.",/review/rw3437736/?ref_=tt_urv

","For anyone that's read anything I've reviewed you'll be aware that I generally have a lot to say for myself, having watched Grimsby I must admit I'm left utterly speechless, there are truly few words I can think of. I genuinely can't decide if I loved it, or hated it, but I will try and review as best I can. ",/review/rw3437736/?ref_=tt_urv

","I would like to report an assault. The assault was made March 10, 2016 when Brothers Grimsby was unwittingly unleashed upon the world and permanently damaged my eyes, my heart, my dignity and my self- worth. Three times I wanted to leave this movie, three times I sat back down and took it on the jaw. I watched this movie for you so you don't have to; be thankful.",/review/rw3437736/?ref_=tt_urv

",Great raw humor no holding back in this flick...So tired of all the negative reviews of this wonderful film from the sensitive wimps of the comic book intellectual universe where every joke needs a proper set up or delivery or can't be too much against my twitter world of perception...I am a big fan of Sacha Baron Cohen and love his humor...So nice to see him still pushing the envelope...I really do believe only those with a real sense of humor get this and those who don't go watch the PG or PG-13 world of politically correct don't offend anybody sensitive let's all be friendly fantasy world you live in...KEEP IT RAW AND KEEP OFFENDING THOSE WHO OFFEND SACHA!!!
