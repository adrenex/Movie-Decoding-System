1 June 2004,rosscinema,7," Low key but poignant film
",One of the things that this film does so well is point out how people make ethnic jokes totally unaware that some of the people around them may be of the same ethnicity. This gives the central character the opportunity to get a good look at what type of person that they really are and how to react to it. Story takes place in the 1950's and is about David Greene (Brendan Fraser) who is Jewish and from Scranton and and he gets a scholarship to a good prep school in the New England area and he decides not to tell anyone about his being Jewish. He's recruited to be the new quarterback on the football team and once he arrives he meets some of his new dorm buddies. His roommate is Chris Reece (Chris O'Donnell) and the person he is replacing at quarterback is Charlie Dillon (Matt Damon) who likes to tell people that he is going steady with the beautiful Sally Wheeler (Amy Locane). David does well in his studies and becomes a star on the team and gets along with everyone but once he meets Sally sparks fly.,/review/rw3327531/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2003,Shapster11,," ""Is it worth breaking tradition""?
","It's a line the headmaster of the school asks the star quarterback David Greene when he catches him praying at church after curfew but praying in observance of the Jewish new year. Greene's reply to the Headmaster of this Christian Prep Academy is...""mine or yours"". This is the essence of the storyline. A Christian Prep Academy in New England is tired of mediocrity in football and losing to their arch rival so they compromise their admission standards by recruiting a brilliant student athlete from Pa. The problem isn't that David Greene doesn't measure up academically, it is that he is Jewish.",/review/rw3327531/?ref_=tt_urv

","What is it about Jews that so many people hate them? From as far back as the Old Testament, to the weekly ramblings of Pat Buchanan and the fanatical Iranian president, Jews just can't seem to catch a break. What is it they've done that's so bad? They murdered Jesus, did they? And the Romans had nothing to do with that? ",/review/rw3327531/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am a huge fan of Fraser, and I own most of his movies.  I have always enjoyed School Ties, although I never really appreciated it until I spent my first week in college.  Feeling completely different and alone, I put the video in my TV/VCR combo and hermitted for two hours. I may not of faced the harshness that Greene felt, and I was not the victim of some anti-ethnic group, but I was pressured into doing a lot of stuff that I didn't feel comfortable doing, just like Fraser's character.  They way he handled it made me realize that I shouldn't give in to anyone....I love you Brendan, you are my hero.  Even if it was just a role.",/review/rw3327531/?ref_=tt_urv

","I see this movie every once and a while on USA or TNT, I never watch all of it, but a few days ago I finally did and it was absolutely wonderful. It makes you wanna watch it again. Though some parts were slightly disturbing, the movie was still excellent.

He is a successful football player and makes many friends and is quite popular. But has to keep his religion in secret in fear of mockery and torment of his fellow classmates. Starring this wonderful cast, Brendan Fraser in his first major role, Matt Damon & Ben Affleck back when they were young and innocent. Before they had Oscar nominations starring in low-budget dramas.

","I liked this movie the first time I watched it,which is probably why I have watched it twice since then.Seeing future stars in a small time movie was a bonus but it was the story that appealed to me.Anti-Semitism was once the ""in-thing"",just as lynching African Americans was once accepted and condoned.It's a sad and shameful part of our history,a part that we'd like to forget but we most definitely shouldn't...because if we do we just might repeat ourselves,and nobody wants to do that...do they?",/review/rw3327531/?ref_=tt_urv

7 August 1999,flickaddict,9," Jewish middle-class boy gets into elite-highschool, and gets into trouble when he hides the fact that he's jewish.
","Great drama with even greater performances from the relatively young and unknown cast. Especially Brendan Fraser's acting is really intense. One of his first roles, and in my opinion his best. He was not yet as famous as he is now ( after, for example, a film as 'the Mummy' ), but I think that his acting never had the intensity and credibility of that part.(In fact, I was shocked when I discovered that it was in fact Fraser in the horrible "" George of the jungle' ! How could a fine actor like him accept such a terrible role ?  )  Also Matt Damon (also an unknown actor at that time )and the other young actors are great. A terrific, subtle drama !",/review/rw3327531/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2003,AEEd,," How can we miss the import of casual ""joking""?
","I've read the first 30 comments about this movie.  Not once did anyone comment on the reasons why Greene (Fraser) never mentioned his religion -- the casual ""joking"" and ""common knowledge"" comments heard in the bathroom. Is it any less a matter of prejudice to use the phrase ""I jewed him down"" than it would be to use the term ""kike""? Is telling a derogatory joke about homosexuals any more offensive than calling us ""fag""? This is the only movie I can think of right off-hand other than ""The Laramie Project"" that makes the point that casual speech can be used as a form of maintaining prejudice. For this reason alone, ""School Ties"" is an important film. As a survivor of a 1964 prep school much like the one in the movie, I can tell you that the scenes and attitudes are accurately presented. I found the characters to be a little one-sided, yes.  It's rare to meet any person who is as totally focused and determined as the Greene presented here.  Nor is any prejudiced person or group normally so totally open in expression as the ""good old boys"" we see in this production.  But, that's the most impressive way to show the public just how bad it is to be bigoted or to be the target of bigotry. For the production and acting values I'd give this film 6 on a scale of 10.  For the ""pre-star"" status performances of Fraser, O'Donell, Damon, and, yes, even Affleck, I'd give it a 7.5 on a scale of 10.  For the message I'd give it 9.5 on that same scale. ""School Ties"" is a movie that can be enjoyed by anyone who sees it. For ""star followers"", it has a cool four New Idols in ""pre-star"" roles to add to their tape collections.  For the activists in the world it is a stark and dramatic example of how prevalent unrecognised bigotry is in our society.",/review/rw3327531/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 1999,mbellas,10," Brendan Fraser is an incredibly underrated actor...
","The performance of Mr. Fraser is incredible he plays his role with a passion and precision I have seldom seen in other actors short of the Jack Nicholson's and  Robert De Nero's of the world.  It is a story of teenage troubles with ""fitting in"" and the search for identity mixed with the horrors of prejudice.   The film does not get bogged down in useless scenes and dialog to dive home its point.  It is an ""issue"" movie that is subtle enough that you may not even realize it was an ""issue"" movie until after it is over.  The story line never slows down there is always something going on that is both attention grabbing and pertinent to the plots development. Without the use of blatant sex and violence this film showcases the talent of three rising young stars (Chris O'Donnell and Matt Damon also star) as actors, not the big box office stars or teen heartthrobs, that they all went on to become.  This is a well written, beautifully directed and phenomenally acted film that anyone can enjoy and relate too.",/review/rw3327531/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2011,thinker1691,8," "" It is for the honor I must turn you in. Saving myself is a bonus ""
","Every fine Eastern school has some old traditions. When selecting a college or University which will eventually become your Alma Matter, it become doubly prestigious. Therein, too are the seeds of bigotry, racism and often as not antisemitism. This story written by Dick Wolf and directed by Robert Mandel is a fine addition to so many others which bring out the often buried hatred of classmates whom we so often considered our most steadfast friends. This then is the story of David Greene (Brendan Fraser) who selected as his best friend Charlie Dillon (Matt Damon). Together they strive to make their way through the school year. However, even though they share the hardships and principals of the rigors of the school, theirs is also a tenuous friendship based on wealth and social standing. Both of which are prerequisites for social acceptance. When Dillion's envy of his best friend gets the better of him, he uses any means to right what he believes to be his share of the school popularity. Chris O'Donnell, Ben Affleck and Kevin Tighe round out the cast. The movie is exceptional for exposing what many schools lack the courage to do. Further, the combination of it's cast insure this will become a Classic, for the young actors. ****",/review/rw3327531/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2006,camrik505,8," A touching reference to racial segregation in 1950's America
","A brilliant 'coming-of-age' style film, in the tradition of ""Dead Poet's Society"". Starring a bevy of familiar faces during their up-and-coming phase: Matt Damon, Brendan Fraser, Chris O'Donnell, Cole Hauser and Amy Locane, this brilliant flick explores the challenges of a young, Jewish hopeful, David Greene (Fraser) who hides his religion from a group of bigots upon entering a prestigious preparatory school. Unaware of his identity, the students welcome him into the fold, until a prejudiced student (Damon) discloses his identity after discovering a romantic friendship developing between his own girlfriend (Amy Locane) and Greene. When one of the students cheats on his final exam - and Greene is accused - the class is requested to deliberate on a verdict, forcing them to choose between their own personal prejudices and the struggle to be impartial.

23 May 2019,gufi-04429,6," where is the connection?
","Okay, I admit, I chose this movie only because I wanted to watch something like Dead Poets Society again. Well, it wasn't anything like that but not in the bad way.
I enjoyed the originality of the plot and I liked that the movie is focused on discrimination based on racism. Also the acting game was good. But although many things in this movie were great, some were not. The biggest minus for me was the lack of connection between the beginning and the end of the movie. Let me explain what I mean. After the first hour of the film (where mostly we see how the main character David makes friends and even has a relationship with a girl) his secret is revealed (he is a jew!). So in the next hour we see the racism and the injustice directed towards him. Finally, justice triumphs and everyone gets what they deserved. But the main character is left alone. We do not see what happens to the relationship between his roomate (who was one of the few people that stood up for him) and we don't see how the other students that were his friends initially react (How did Sally react to the news that Charlie is expelled?). A lot of things that we saw in the first part of the movie remain unfinished in the end. My point is, why would we, the viewers, want to watch the first hour of the movie if we don't see what happens with all the information we had (because of that first part) in the end?!
For me, what I explained just now affected the movie's potential to be something really great and outstanding. It's not bad but it could have been much better.",/review/rw3327531/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2002,Bourque77,," Great Movie, Great Actors
","I just watched School Ties recently and I was quite impressed with it. The acting was excellent as 4 previously unknown actors made their big breaks, Brendan Fraser (pre-George Of The Jungle) is awesome as Jewish boy David Green. Chris O'Donnell (pre-Vertical Limit) plays the role of Reece with good convictions and Ben Affleck & Matt Damon (pre-Good Will Hunting) are great. Matt plays the role of jealous bigot Charlie with good character and conviction. It's just a shame that Ben Affleck didn't have much of a speaking role. For those of you who are fans of Fraser, Affleck, Damon & O'Donnell, this movie is worth checking out 8 out of 10 in my books",/review/rw3327531/?ref_=tt_urv

","One in ten thousand films concerning discrimination against Jewish people that did not end tragically. Unfortunately it is also about one in ten thousand films of the sort that is not based directly on actual events. The question then becomes is it better to have an unlikely story that ends happily or a truthful one that ends tragically, it is up to the individual viewer to decide. Personally I love a great victory story, the oppressed gaining ground over the regime which oppresses it, no matter how unlikely. It presents a sobering message cloaked in the guise a coming of age story filled with the up and coming actors of the time, making it all the more accessible to various audiences and thereby spreading the message of equality further than other related films due to the seriousness of the subject matter. There were plenty of great zingers and the spot on acting of the main cast makes many scenes of the film memorable.",/review/rw3327531/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2016,sol-,6," Concealed Identity
","Given a scholarship to an exclusive protestant boarding school in desperate need of a star quarterback, a Jewish athlete is instructed to conceal his religion with grave consequences in this drama set during the 1950s. Brendan Fraser provides an earnest turn as the internally conflicted young man in question, however, the movie takes an inordinate amount of time to warm up. The main dynamic driving the film, after all, is how all of Fraser's peers react after inevitably finding out the truth, and yet this does not occur until around halfway in with little else driving the plot. A fascinating subplot involves Zeljko Ivanek as a pedantic French teacher who causes one of Fraser's peers to have a mental breakdown. There are also some memorable dialogue exchanges as the students discuss the pressures and expectations placed upon them. Additionally, there is a curious dynamic at play with the school ""using"" Fraser for football and Fraser in turn using the school as a platform for college. That said, the vast majority of the film revolves around anti-Semitism, which is unfortunately never quite as interesting as kids cracking under pressure or a school manipulating its students. The anti-Semitism angles is not totally uninteresting though, especially as the boys discuss how few Jews they have actually known and come to realise that a lot of the stereotypes they have come to know might just be stereotypes, but the film could have easily been about so much more. Fraser is really good in any case, and same goes for Matt Damon as the student who most aggressively antagonises him.",/review/rw3327531/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2011,moonspinner55,4," A Jew in the Campus Closet...dramatically, the moment his secret's revealed is all we have to wait for
","""School Ties"", written by Dick Wolf and Darryl Ponicsan from Wolf's story, seems as if it must be a remake of something (possibly with Sal Mineo or James MacArthur in the lead). Athletic, handsome young man in the mid-1950s, the son of a blue-collar railroad worker in Pennsylvania, receives a scholarship to play football at prestigious boys' prep school in Boston. He's Jewish but keeps his religion under-wraps, and for good reason: the other lads swap anti-Semitic gossip in the locker room (right before the Senior Mixer!) and another boy confidentially tells our hero that one must go along with the curriculum if he wants to succeed. This is the kind of movie that might have been extended from a short; the first hour's set-up is practically irrelevant. The screenwriters lazily stack the deck against Brendan Fraser's well-meaning protagonist, even giving prejudiced-pal Matt Damon a reason to expose the Jew: he stole his girl! The '50s atmosphere is laid on thickly, what with an opening rumble between the ducktails and the bikers in an alley; we aren't even spared the proverbial prank on the snooty French teacher (who caused a student to have the same classroom breakdown that Natalie Wood suffered in ""Splendor in the Grass""). It's a ridiculous picture, only notable now for the array of young talent in the cast. ** from ****",/review/rw3327531/?ref_=tt_urv
