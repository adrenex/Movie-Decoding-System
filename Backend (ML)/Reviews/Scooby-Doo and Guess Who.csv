12 May 2022,darenbooth,10," Captivating, strong and thoroughly enjoyable
","I've loved every single episode of this show. The casting is second to none and Nicola Walker is breathtaking as Hannah Stern. The dynamic between the characters works on every level. It's a sensitive and difficult subject and you get to see all aspects of that across the series. The writer/writers got it spot on. Easily one of the best U. K. drama shows. It is an emotional roller coaster, heartwarming and sad. There are predictable elements that shock when it happens and then others you second guess and are left strangely disappointed that they didn't happen. Thoroughly engaging.",/review/rw5752407/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2018,cristhak,8," A very realistic depiction of complicated human relationships
","It's human, real, with no frills. Doesn't sweeten the pill and hits the nail on the head without turning into a soap. It's about everyday real life and (family) relationships. 
I'm also partial towards Nicola Walker whom I've watched in pretty much everything she's done - she's just great. Rest of the cast really good too. Would recommend.",/review/rw5752407/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2020,nezbitkn2,8," Finally over then...
",The first series was a very well depicted portrayal of someone being deceitful within a relationship. The second series thankfully illuminates the damage that does to everyone involved. Very powerful and intense. Definitely worth a watch.,/review/rw5752407/?ref_=tt_urv

5 July 2020,levybob,9," Stick with it. It goes to the Unexpected.
",Stick with 'The Split' Season One. And Season 2 is even better. Attorneys who specialize in Family Law / Divorce find themselves ill-equipped to deal with their specialty when it comes to their 'real' / private lives.,/review/rw5752407/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2019,mybeloved-bb,10," Wow.Wow..Wow
",Love everything about The Split! What a surprise I had no idea I would be watching something that I absolutely enjoyed beginning to end.. i coud go on and on about it but to me its a window into a family living life.. an imperfect family thats very real . I feel as if i know them...,/review/rw5752407/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2020,sandiesh-86719,8," I've gone through every emotion
","And incredible drama.
I have gone through every emotion whilst watching this, it's been an amazing drama from season 1 till 2. Understand the ins and outs of a working family, and the flaws of a marriage!
Couldn't give it credit enough!!",/review/rw5752407/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2018,lyninbyron,9," LOVED IT! CANT WAIT FOR SERIES 2
","Great cast, great script and well put together. I binge watched series one and was engrossed until the end. Well done to all involved and keep em coming",/review/rw5752407/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2022,whitnall,8," A love song to Nicola Walker fans
","A tour de force by Walker, with an outstanding supporting cast. The show becomes more and more of a soap opera as it goes on, but every once in a while there is a scene where she just blows you away.",/review/rw5752407/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2022,Veritas99,10," Excellent!

5 March 2020,Emma_Marie29,9," Surprisingly Wonderful!
","I'm not a big fan of law shows, but I like Nicola Walker so I thought I'd give it a shot. It was good from the start but by episode 3 I simply loved it. The characters, the acting and the writing is all well done. When season one ended I assumed my streaming service would go straight to season 2. That was my only disappointment-I can't find where to stream season 2 : (",/review/rw5752407/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2020,david_r_cox,8," such a good series
",You can't go wrong went Nicola Walkers name appears in the cast,/review/rw5752407/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2019,Ranbl,9," Fantastic journey
","The first 4 episodes are very good but the last two are freakin fantastic. Annabel Scholey busts the whole show open and really shines and takes over. In such a stellar cast it takes herculean effort to stand out and she does. This show is part legal drama part family drama but mostly it just feels like real life with all good and bad. You will love this series, guaranteed.",/review/rw5752407/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2018,skyguide-43025,10," We loved this !
","Walker was brilliant. The ensemble cast worked so well together. Most impressive was the intricate character development and detailed plot situations. Nothing was formula here. Outstanding writing! This may appeal to women most but it is not a ""chick flick"". It's sure to generate discussion and throughly entertain those who like a modern domestic drama. My first 10 star rating.",/review/rw5752407/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2020,mj-taylor,10," Important series, very special
","The BAFTA (and SAG, Golden Globe, Oscar) - worthy, and Olivier Award-Winner, Nicola Walker plays Hannah Stern intelligently, humanly. The second series develops all the characters without exception expertly and interestingly, and the stories are all absorbing. Shout-outs to Barry Atsma, Stephen Mangan, Annabel Scholey, Fiona Button and Deborah Findlay - who are all superb in their lead roles. Donna Air is also a revelation. This is an important drama about everything it means to be human nowadays. Very special indeed.",/review/rw5752407/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2020,TruthSeeker-49994,10," Emotional and Brilliant!
",This is an extremely gripping drama. It's been well thought out with a brilliant script and amazing characters. The acting is faultless from every single actor and they have all been chosen to fit their individual characters.,/review/rw5752407/?ref_=tt_urv

20 April 2022,simmsmaggy,10," Shocks, frocks and surviving life's knocks
","It would be very easy to be critical of this series. After all, how hard can life be when you appear to have a kitchen bigger than my entire house and garden. The parade of fashions puts 'Killing Eve' well in the shade and the apparently heroic amounts of booze are consumed on a daily basis.",/review/rw5752407/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2022,littlestewart-06716,8," Keep at it!
","I binged watched all 3 seasons. The first season was a bit slow, the second season picked up and the third season was just amazing!",/review/rw5752407/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2020,keith-618,3," Season 1 was promising
",But Season 2 reminds me of one of those tawdry American daytime soaps of the past - wealthy privileged lawyers jumping in and out bed with each other. I lost the will to live. One character is a chronic alcoholic kleptomaniac for two episodes but then recovers miraculously in the next. Episode 5 was the low point though - the Moot Court fake court case for students is used in a jaw droppingly amateurish manner to expose the real life drama of the protagonists. God save me. This production features an experienced well heeled cast but sadly it is let down by substandard shallow writing. Even the usually impressive Nicola Walker fails to make us care. And don't get me started on those ghastly 'meaningful' pop songs.,/review/rw5752407/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2022,bosporan,3," Enjoyable series destroyed by self-indulgent writing
",Season one is a decent drama with excellent talent (Nicola Walker and Stephen Mangan) and a well-written core story exploring tension in both the professional and personal lives in a family-owned family-law practice.,/review/rw5752407/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2020,jtdw10,10," Love this show!

11 July 2022,lisbethinsydney,4," Fairy story time
","Watching Nicola Walker breathe her way through an anxiety attack, gasping like a fish, is a major feature of season three. And forget work - the assistants have disappeared and the leads' personal stories triumph over everything else. (If I were one of their clients I'd triple-check the billable hours.) Hannah can do no wrong, except she does to Nathan. Shouldn't a loving father be able to see his children after divorcing their mother? This series is aimed at the ""women can have it all"" female demographic who don't see another side to any of their core beliefs. The only plot line of any real drama and excitement revolved around Xander and Nina but this wasn't allowed to go anywhere. The writers' resolution to this season's angst was to wave a magic wand to turn Hannah into a wise and wonderful fairy godmother - and throw another party. If you have anything to do with Family Law, as I do, you cannot take this series seriously. We really do live in a fake world if this is considered to be ""brilliant drama"".",/review/rw5752407/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2022,davepasnthru,5," This Is a Soap Opera, Right?
",I have watched one and a half seasons of this show and it is increasingly obvious that this is a soap opera at night rather than a daytime show. It's like watching The Young and the Restless or All my Children.,/review/rw5752407/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2020,qui_j,4," Filled with cliched and stereotyped characters
","This theme of strong female lawyers, battling against one another, has been done to death both in TV and movies. There is nothing new here. The writing is bad as is the acting. Lines are delivered in unfinished dialog, and short sentences. The lead actress has two main expressions when delivering her lines, either one of inappropriate affect and the other like a fish gasping for air. Parts of the script appear to have improvised dialog which makes one wonder how respected actors and actresses could sink this low to do a script like this. I guess we all have rent or mortgages to pay!",/review/rw5752407/?ref_=tt_urv
