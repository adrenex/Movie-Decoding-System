","Beautiful scenery, amazing shots, interesting characters and story. Can't wait to find out more.",/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2018,mbs-50561,10," Completely agree with the rest
",Every second packed with intensity in this first episode - I'm flabbergasted! Ending of the episode left me yearning for more instantly! I haven't felt like this about a series since first time I watched True Blood (not that they compare in any way). Very catching! I certainly hope the rest of the series live up to this first episode!,/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2021,opticuscro,4," Yet another romatic overkill!
","In the beginning, this series is watchable and interesting, the first season can be watched with interest, although the interesting part is at the very beginning of the first three episodes. Later, um yes, yet another modern over romanticized tv show, where forbidden love and other romance-related situations completely determine the plot of each episode. Such an approach somewhat stifles the adventurous spirit that series like this should have. The series is watchable and I find it to be some mediocre time killer! I don't know why is like that, today when they shoot a fiction or science fiction series they insert that forced romance every time and that let's be realistic is not interesting, Its like if they don't overkill in romance the series can't be filmed, thats probably some modern new composed rules for the genre of fiction and science fiction!",/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2021,Shaun863,5," Strong start ..... ? Poor execution?
","The first few episodes keep the viewers engaged, but after that point it falls short laking action, mystery, and anything that might keep you wanting to continue. I did finish the series, but they failed to access the potential suspense of the series.",/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2021,supertaz80,5," Season 1 was ok. Season 2 meh
","I have reviewed this previously based on season 1 which was 'ok' except that it had some very cringe dialogue, Palmer is not the best (in this role?), and there's a lack of chemistry.",/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2018,omniarchos,9," It's been a long time
","A long time since I've been this excited waiting for the next episode. This show is great. It has great production, good actors, believable fantasy society, the characters are adults (finally) and it grabs attention and holds it. I love it.",/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2018,newday-172-261427,9," What an amazing pilot, seems promising
","EDIT on Season one finale
-1 Point for poor special effects and some cheezy moments",/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2021,Tzaddiq,5," Mislead by other reviewers
","I was lead to believe that because this contained adults, it was going to be for adults. But the writing suggests these 1000 year old creatures were born yesterday. They have no wisdom of years, do not act at all conservatively, can be defeated by parlor tricks despite somehow surviving for a dozen generations, and fall in love after a couple of glances. The actors are hot; I'll give them that.",/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2018,sonsearle-78410,7," I have to stop comparing it to the books
",I just read the books so they are so fresh in my mind and the series is different; examples characters are very different Ysabeau in the book although Matthew's mother was made a vampire when she was younger not an elderly woman like in the tv series. The story line is loosely based on the books but is also very different. I like the books better but the series on its own is enjoyable if I keep reminding myself it's just based on the book series it's not the same. Worth a watch,/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2021,sipa_p,3," Season 2 is ridiculous
","Where to even begin.. The most horrific part of season 2 is Theresa Palmer's acting. She just can't act, the only thing she can do is the teary eyes look an it's in almost every scene because that's probably the only thing that made the cut. Matthew Goode is also terrible in it and he is decent actor otherwise. He just growls at everyone. Between the two of them they have zero chemistry. Diana's character has almost no agency, she is just trying to manage the bad boy Matthew. Their relationship makes no sense, there is no continuity from one scene to the next. The main topic of the season 2 is not finding The Book of Life or getting Diana the witch training she needs (which btw consists of her standing in the middle of the room and tying knots), it is coaching Matthew on his (blood)rage issues. It is boring let alone very outdated. Oh and! To mess up with time as Diana's father finally! Points out.",/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2018,Wikkid_Gamez,10," After waiting for this show for what seems like forever.....
","What to say? I have been waiting for this show with mixed emotions from the first whisper of it being done... I have wanted to see it come alive from the first book I read years ago and honestly never thought I would see it happen because of the sheer amount of plots, sub plots and the long list of primary and secondary characters that are constantly changing from book to book. I absolutely love the trilogy it is in my top 5 all time favorite book trilogies/series ...",/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2019,shoppsi,10," I love this!
","This is such an interesting series! I love the characters, the setting, the storyline...everything.
Every single episode leaves me wanting more.
I'm going to read the trilogy now.",/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2018,bestford,1," Am I watching a different show!
",Am I watching something different to everyone else! This is one of those shows that is flat with no atmosphere at all.. The main character looks startled all the time and the vampire a cryptic mess and a bit meh. I'd rather watch the new Sabrina thanks.,/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2022,MongoLloyd,1," Social Justice Witches
","I really liked the first season. As a former student of the occult and witch craft, I really got a kick out of the grand displays of physical magic (as fictional as they may be). Add Teresa Palmer, and I'm a fan. However, the story seems to have veered into a distinct social/racial justice territory with the entire 3rd season devoted to revenge for the murder of a witch of color at the hands of a power hungry white man-witch who was kicked out of his own congregation at the behest of a demon of color.",/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2021,FilmMcCool,4," Season 2 is Awful
","I have read all three books so I really wanted this to be good and Season 1 while not terrific was good, I enjoyed it. However Season 2 seems to be all about eye candy, esp the dresses. Nothing good happens for large parts of a series. I mean these are Vampires and Witches, surely there could have been an edge to it but mostly we get Matthew speeding across a room to growl at someone just to remind us he is not a human. Even in modern day London where a Vampire is tearing humans apart there is no tension about the attacks. The saving grace of season 2 was Purefoys performance as Philippe, top notch acting.",/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2021,snramz-04055,4," Disappointing season 2
",Had been so eargely waiting for the return of this film. What an anti-climax season has been. Truly disappointed.,/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2021,cdickson-82033,5," Not as anticipated
","Sadly the second series lacks intrigue, energy and pace to keep watching. It has become a costume drama with a storyline of mythological creatures so visible to everyone it makes the witch hunts pointless.
I have kept watching more out of a desire to see the passion and intrigue of series one return",/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2018,mrscrispy,4," Teresa Palmer a Liability to Everyone Involved
","What a giant martyred pain in the ass Teresa Palmers character is & I don't think I can stomach anymore of her long tortured little girl glaring into the distance. She's pretty dumb about everything, for apparently being an academic specialising in this field.
Wasted opportunity w this series, could have been excellent.",/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2018,fdaughte,10," Phew!
",A Discovery of Witches is one of my favorite books so I was so nervous watching this first episode but no need they did it justice very true to the books -,/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2021,secretstory,5," I watch for Matthew Goode
",I have run out of series to binge on. This is my second attempt at watching. Have fallen asleep twice so far.,/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2022,betschambers-541-491222,2," Failed
","Missed huge info from the book. Sarah and Diana appearance almost spot on. The rest, meh. Especially Isabo and Phillipe. Sub poor acting, sorry. The whole blood rage acting bit was very Twilight. Missed many key characters in the 2nd season.",/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2021,pritchetts114,6," Well filmed, but lacking a mature viewpoint
","At first you will think you are watching a fantasy drama for adults, but not far into season one you will realize this was written for 12 to 13 year old girls. Sexual attraction is handled very chastely, no one drinks in excess if at all, and our main character is struggling with issues usually experienced by teens, not twenty-somethings. She is the best, the brightest, most courageous person anyone has ever seen, plus very innocent, but that whole package is overdone so much so, it becomes obvious this is a tween girl's fantasy. She is going to be given a full professorship in the history dept at Oxford University at 23 or so years old because she's so brilliant. Really? She simply doesn't have enough life experience, and proves it each episode. That said, this is not a lighthearted silly show like many written for younger viewers.",/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2021,faisalsarhi,3," S01 amazing S02 horrible
","I watched S01 and it was amazing on every level, the acting the effects, the story line ... literally everything was spot on .... I could not wait to watch S02 but i was very disappointed, it is as if i was watching another boring clumsy slow series ... what a waste.",/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2020,trishee,10," Love it love it
","Such an Amazing show, I can't wait for season 2.
Great actors, and scenery.",/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2022,JeopardyLeyton,3," Way too cheesy/cringeworthy
","It's a sort of tacky, cheesy soap opera but with witches and vampires. It takes itself far far too seriously, which makes the whole thing feel embarrassing. If it injected some humour and was more tongue in cheek, acknowledging that it's just a pretty ridiculous supernatural/teen romance/twilight style romp, then that would've made it more bearable I think. I just keep feeling bad for the actors while I'm watching it.",/review/rw7768871/?ref_=tt_urv
