23 August 2021,JabezGill,9," Ignore the reviews!
",Clearly there are a lot of bots on here - so many of the negative reviews either didn't watch beyond the first episode or take issue with the portrayal of the Russian or some other stupid thing that is ultimately unrelated to the show.,/review/rw7392023/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2021,mgumsley,7," Interesting look at Post war Berlin
","There's something about Berlin that seems to inspire writers, and this particular series reminds me of another( probably better) police series called Babylon Berlin, although it was set in another era.",/review/rw7392023/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2021,ferdinand1932,6," Overcooked
",The technical facets to this are excellent. The whole look and design is really full of dust and rubble and a vanquished nation. The actors too show their skill and across the various nationalities all hit their marks.,/review/rw7392023/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2021,yoshi-features,8," Underrated
","I don't get the negative reviews here, yes it's far from perfect, but to say it's about white American saviours is a joke considering it's written by Germans. The show paints a good picture of immediate post war Berlin and the premise kept me glued right through the end.",/review/rw7392023/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2021,JottaH,10," Do not trust the negative reviews.
","People saying that it shows 1 group as good or others as bad, have either not seen all the episodes, or they're biased to hell and back. The show depicts villains and heroes in every corner. British, Russian, American, German, French... Perhaps it is a sign of the times that we live in that people choose to see just one side, but I assure you that it hits in all directions. It also shows humanity and decency from all directions.",/review/rw7392023/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2021,yooniverse,5," A decent show despite shortcomings
","First of all, ""Shadowplay"" is a dumb name for this show. ""The Defeated"", the show's original title, might have been better. But neither really captures the show that well. Set in post-war Germany shortly after their defeat, the show's early episodes seem to do a decent job of capturing the misery, desperation, and the broken remains of a country and its people who not only lost the war, but had their civilization bombed into submission.",/review/rw7392023/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2021,Ralindon0,6," Just one detail drives me crazy

16 December 2020,dlbottla,8," for ilya-belkin
","This is not bad, and no where a propaganda show. Not no where near the others we see today. ilya is obviously upset that Russian's are portrayed for the brutality that they displayed after the war. This is just truth, many of us saw this, even way after the war was over, me personally in West Berlin.",/review/rw7392023/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2021,bay-77008,7," That was it? I'm left hanging.
","That was not a very satisfying finale of the first season. Especially if there isn't another one. There was no cliff hanger but also no resolution. The acting was fine but there were some unrealistic scenes for sure. This period in history is seldom discussed or the topic of movies. I found it fascinating and would like to see more of the reconstruction of Germany after WWII. I hope there is another season and we learn more about the lives of the remaining characters and where they're headed. I really like the main character, Max. I just feel like this story was dropped before its time.",/review/rw7392023/?ref_=tt_urv

21 August 2021,bshaef,7," Started off good
","Ended up quite contrived and I think some of the actors got tired of their roles especially the star. Also had so many story lines I kind of lost track of what was happening. I'm assuming there will be more ""Nazi Hunters go to Rome"". I'll probably watch but it could have been so much better had the story been more focused.",/review/rw7392023/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2021,Med-Jasta,10," Cinematic originality
",Something missing from a lot of TV shows. Another thing is that there's no fat. So many shows dilly dally and hold off on exciting stuff. Not this one. Each episode ends without anything big necessarily happening. And holy crap it actually looks like a movie. And the CG is flawless.,/review/rw7392023/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2021,douglasmcbroom,4," Ach du lieber, it's glacial!
","What a shame. The time and place is ripe for a great story. Unfortunately, this is not it. There are so many plot threads that none get told. The story drags and never gets out of first gear.",/review/rw7392023/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2021,hayley96,7," Remove the Bad Backstory and it's a Good Show
","The setting is great, it's what I imagine Berlin looked like after the war. The audience knows who the characters are and we have a plot. I think the writers had enough with the fish out of water in Max, the corruption in Berlin, the politics of the sectors and an ugly American profiting from ex-Nazis. What doesn't work is Max, the American cop's backstory of a mentally ill brother killing off Nazis and Nazi sympathizers because of a very complicated family history. It isn't necessary. The other unnecessary element is the way Michael C. Hall plays the state department official. Way, wy over the top and out of another show.",/review/rw7392023/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2021,mallaverack,6," Disappointing anticipation
","My tv channel broadcasting this series started advertising with trailers at least six weeks before the screening of Episode 1. On the look-out for entertaining and well-made tv series I told everyone to look out for ""Shadowplay"" because it seemed like the next 'big thing'.
Because the storyline dealt with the very early post-war Berlin, a subject not greatly explored in general cinema and tv, I very much looked forward to watching this series. But unlike many critics here, after 4 episodes, I'm greatly disappointed. So much so that even small details are annoying. So the two brothers make a pledge in the late 1920 to 'watch each other's back' an expression first used in print in a 1974 novel by John Le Carre. On the same occasion a very young Max uses the 'f' expletive and the character is the only in the series to continually repeat same when we meet him as an American policeman in 1946. What's the point? Realistically was this word's usage all the vogue at that time? It doesn't seem in character with the adult Max and is utterly annoying.
Enough has been said on the caricature of the Russians as thoroughly evil. It also beggars belief that a lone US cop would be sent to Germany to organise a policeforce but not be given any of the materials needed to get such a project off the ground. And it seems a bit of lazy scriptwriting that so far the main emphasis seems to be on Max finding his brother Moritz.",/review/rw7392023/?ref_=tt_urv

8 September 2022,gphgrm01,3," Badly written story
","This is an expensive production, however the story is very badly written. Its simply incomprehensible that someone dears to use a historically sensitive period as a background to a pretty bad and unconvincing stereotypical American thriller plot.",/review/rw7392023/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2021,shoobe01-1,6," Impossibly trite
","Supervillains. Dark histories. American savior. Everyone is on the take one way or another, etc etc. Promising, with a good German cast and secondary stories of law enforcement in the weird bureaucracy of post war Berlin, but overshadowed by the dumb A plot.",/review/rw7392023/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2021,traceytak,10," Highly recommended engrossing mini series
","This is a great mini series, a binge worthy one. It depicts characters like any other good mini series, with both good and evil characters and it is done very well.",/review/rw7392023/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2021,jwxujerry,7," Talking about Soviet brutality
","In response to KkonaW's review about Soviet brutality after the war, I think it's the opposite. The brutality of Soviet is not exaggerated. The brutality of Soviet soldiers is largely overlooked. Japan occupied northeast China for over 30 years but it was the Soviet army that exerted brutal force there - rape and robbery were just their standard practice. But the Chinese Communist Party just looked the other way.",/review/rw7392023/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2021,mikeh-54044,2," Absolute Ignorance of the History & Wannabe A ting
","Sigh.... The writers could have done better with History for Dummies. Civil police investigating military crimes. No MP patrols. Zero evidence of the Military Administration. Lousy acting, and not much plot. Two points for sets and scenes.",/review/rw7392023/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2021,xianvon,9," Poor Criticism
","Anyone who claims that roles of Russians and Americans are oversimplified fails to properly read the nuances of the characters. The Americans are not portrayed as saviors, but are as corrupt as anyone. And the Russians' portrayal evolves as they demonstrate humanity and kindness in the end. Pay no attention to these critics. Watch the show and see for yourself. It's very good.",/review/rw7392023/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2021,anthonyowatts,9," Complex dramaset is a time when right and wrong were not simple
","I read CarsonTrent's review. I suspect s/he and I didn't see the same program. There is NOTHING black and white about this series. It shows a society divided and under immense stress. It shows characters trying to make sense of the times, while trying to create order. It shows competing political regimes, each of whom thinks they are right. All this with a plot of a brothers love, interwoven by that brother driven to unspeakable horrors because of what he has experienced.",/review/rw7392023/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2021,hendrikdeneyer,7," Intriguing series
","Max is a New York cop sent to Berlin in the aftermath of 1946, to train the local police, a motley crew of amateurs. Actually, Max is hiding something, his real purpose being a slightly more personal one than doing a good job.",/review/rw7392023/?ref_=tt_urv
