27 October 2019,tomasle1995,10," Reviewing the Campaign.
",This COD is the COD I remember. Brutal and raw. Each campaign mission is like you are literally playing a movie. It's almost too brutal and traumatic. The sound design is beyond phenomenal. The voice acting is on point. The stories and characters are instantly loveable from the first minutes. Each mission I literally pause the game and question if I am playing the game or watching a cutscene.,/review/rw5225181/?ref_=tt_urv

26 October 2019,ddupree20,10," What's with the bad reviews on here?
","The graphics most definitely do NOT suck....the graphics are insanely good. This also isn't the worst call of duty ever made. In my opinion (and this seems to be the opinion of every other person that played MW and MW2) this new installment brings it back to what made call of duty the epic game we all know and loved. If you're a fan of the original modern warfares then I highly recommend grabbing this one! It's managed to go above and beyond what I thought it would in terms of game play and story. I've seen people saying it's better than the originals and I'm almost inclined to agree. It's got that gritty, raw in your face action with enough shock value to meet the needs of any fan.",/review/rw5225181/?ref_=tt_urv

","This game is like playing in the movies ""13 hours"", ""Act of Valor"", and ""a American Sniper"" all at once. They really started from the bottom up with this game. I felt completely immersed in the campaign as it required you to make painful decisions. I really hope they continue with this story.",/review/rw5225181/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2020,tateramjass,10," This isn't a game it's a movie!
",This game is great even on console. I played it on PS4 and the graphics looked as if they were from a pc and I would recommend this game to everyone who likes a lot of stealth and operations.,/review/rw5225181/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2019,bobzzy,9," Back to the roots
","The CoD series has finally returned where it belongs. The new MW game is as good as the previous 3 MW games were.
In terms of graphics, sound, music, voice acting, gameplay - the game is 9/10 (occasional bugs here and there).
The story is actually the prequel to the previous MW games.
Campaign is absolutely amazing, although very short, even on veteran difficulty, so I guess the game is aiming for the multiplayer.",/review/rw5225181/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2020,WasiReviews,9," Call of Duty Finally Goes Back to the Golden Era of FPS
","In MW 2019 Activision finally listened to the fans removed all jet-packs and other trash cyberpunk futuristic bs that most fans hated (I am one of the few that found the future s annoying but playable and fun over the original modern warfare story-line or the World at War, Call of Duty Black Ops 1 & 2 story saga (I still have no idea why BO3 was called BO3). Micro-transactions have been taken out except for cosmetics. Game-play is great especially multiplayer with new maps and a lot of maps bringing back memories of COD 4. My biggest gripes with this games are the laggy servers incredibly large download size for Warzone and Modern Warfare which they attempted to fix with the game size decreasing update by uninstalling packs thank God. For the Campaign I won't say anything except that the voice acting is great and it has some of the best triple AAA graphics ever. Captain Price is back (LFGG) and I have no complaints however if you notice cut-scene or speech lag change the audio systems like Boost -> Theater hope that helps if your on Console. Farah Karim adds diversity and a great character to the campaign.",/review/rw5225181/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2019,liksa,10," Epic campaign
","I've only started the campaign this morning on veteran, I'm a few hours in and I think its epic. It's still on the climb and theres no sign of it ending soon love it so far",/review/rw5225181/?ref_=tt_urv

","Certainly a vast improvement on Black OPs 3, which was frankly ludicrous and Black OPs 4. Still of the Black Ops, 2 is hard to beat.",/review/rw5225181/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2019,outrate,1," Any skepticism about American dullness is finally dispelled.

27 October 2019,justin-fencsak,10," This is the best Call of Duty ever!!!
","The multiplayer is where its at as its the most popular part of the games. There's hardly any lag and you can play with other players on other consoles with cross play. Very well done, Activision, well done.",/review/rw5225181/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2019,manojmagecha,5," Underwhelming after 2 weeks of playing
","The storyline is short and simple, predictable and doesn't really pack a punch. Great to see captain price back! And obviously having Piccadilly circus on the maps is a great way to initially get me excited and hyped up about the game. The Co-op is a disappointment, you don't feel there was enough effort put into classic special ops, with there only being one co-op mission to play in that particular mode, and you gotta ask yourself why there isn't a campaign co-op?!! And it's definitely nowhere near as good as zombies!!! Everything feels rushed and the amount of error codes playing online, and glitches, random screen black outs, it is really a disaster release. I've had to open cases with Activision several times. I'm gonna have to compare it to it's predecessor, black ops 4, which was a blockbuster hit, and very innovative without being completely ridiculous like infinite warfare! It's time infinity ward threw in the towel! I don't even like the fact that there are no hardcore multiplayer modes options available online right now, and I'm disappointed to see that already there's a £7.99 DLC. This is a money grabbing waste of a game, your better of purchasing the modern warfare remastered edition and black ops 4 for for a total of £30 then wasting your money on this excuse of a game. I am a hardcore avid player with a k/d ratio over 1.5 consistently since 2008 modern warfare was released. This game is not the modern warfare I remember, and the guns are the only element keeping this particular one in the series, Alive! Everything else is just bad, server problems, and ridiculous size for updates totalling over 80 GB of space required! Patches are being released almost every week! It's a bad start. Max I would pay for this game is £20.00 and even then I'd give it 3 weeks before you decide to let it gather dust!",/review/rw5225181/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2019,gusshepherd,4," Great campaign let down by the frustrating multiplayer
","The campaign in this game is one of the best I've ever played out of any game, just fantastic. However the multiplayer was a massive letdown with the poor maps, awful netcode and tedious gameplay not being at all what I expected. Developers have yet to acknowledge the massive gun balance issues with this game, with only 2 guns really being used (you know the ones). Recent patches have failed to sort out this issue and I think they are now acting like it's a job well done whereas they have only made it worse.",/review/rw5225181/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2020,plantf00d,8," Campaign Only Review
","There is really one word I can think to describe the campaign of this game. Intense. The game takes place in the fictional country of Urzikstan, but it is rather apparent that the real life parallel is that of Syria. There are many instances of ""morally grey"" choices that appear throughout the game, that add depth, but at times seems to beat you over the head. The lack of a soundtrack in many integral parts of the campaign, mainly the mission ""Clean House"" really dials up the immersion and intensity factor. This rarely gets credit in all media, but the sound design is absolutely exceptional in this game! Playing the game on veteran or realistic difficulty also cranks up the intensity. It's honestly a breath of fresh air from previous COD titles that the campaign isn't just a constant run and gun fueled Micheal Bay movie. What I respect most about this title is their ability to capture the toll that civilians take during a conflict. It's something that war games rarely touch on and it was an important aspect I was glad to see. The mission ""Hometown"" exemplifies this with playing as a little girl in a city being bombed and attacked by the Russians, although the encounter with the roided out Russian in farah's house seemed rather hokey and took away from this feeling. On this topic there is a sort of tragic irony that is very apparent in this game. Other reviews pointed out the blatant Russophobia that is constant in this game. I find it ironic how Barkov labels all the Urzikstani as terrorists when it is clearly not the case and yet in the same game we see the Russian forces committing war crime after war crime without a single soldier questioning their morality. The game is already out and there's nothing infinity ward can do about it now but it would have been interesting to have defectors from Barkov's forces fighting alongside farah and Alex to address this element of Russophobia in the game, rather than labeling the all Russian soldiers as mindless killers. All that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the campaign and was happy to see infinity ward making a more gritty game and challenging themselves rather than adhering to the generic FPS mold.",/review/rw5225181/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2020,nix-cornelissen,1," Too many problems to enjoy
","Game is supposedly cross-platform. Platforms do not operate similarly giving certain platforms immense advantages. Bullet registry will favor the player with the higher fps. If you don't play with Sensitivity all the way up then just quit now, because you can't compete with the reflex speeds of those who do. This game also features repetitive spawn kills and frequent lags. Not to mention that the game is now around 270GB.",/review/rw5225181/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2019,styhsuhsu,4," Bad attempt at a plot
","For no reason other than my own insanity, I'm grading the campaign only in my review. I have several issues with how it's set up, but my biggest problem is the way it attempts to guilt the player and tackle difficult issues about war around the world. Naturally it plays well enough, CoD has always had some of the best first person shooty bang bang controls of the genre, yet it breaks up the fast paced action every chance it gets for seemingly no reason.
Multiplayer is bla bla bla words.",/review/rw5225181/?ref_=tt_urv
