","First of all, I just can't believe that this movie was based on a true story. It left me captivated to a point of going back to do research on the real story. I wanted to see pictures of these people in person. I just had to laugh while reading some of it. ",/review/rw7964995/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2016,subxerogravity,6," It's stupidity makes it hilarious, especially for Zach Galifianakis
","Despite having comedy juggernauts like Kristen Wiig, Jason Sudekis and Leslie Jones (The people who made me laugh other than...), Zach Galifianakis was the powerhouse genius that made this movie flow. When he was not on the screen, it did not flow like when he was on, and he was always on. He played stupid so brilliantly that he will have you busting a gut uncontrollably. The more dimwitted the funner it got.",/review/rw7964995/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2016,michaelant555,8," Hilarious!
",I loved it! I haven't laughed this much since Due Date with Robert Downey Jr; in fact I laughed even more during this. I read some very negative reviews on here about this and all I can say is that if you don't have a sense of humour for slapstick comedy then don't leave a negative review because of it.,/review/rw7964995/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2017,lee_eisenberg,8," just funny
","Jared Hess's ""Masterminds"" is the sort of movie that you'll appreciate if you accept low humor. I do. It might be a surprise to learn that the movie is based on a true story (the October 1997 Loomis Fargo robbery). I'm sure that a lot of what the movie shows is added for comic relief, and to let the cast members do their stuff. Even so, they lay everything out quite well, as the scheme's main man sets up the armored car driver as a patsy.",/review/rw7964995/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2016,dave-mcclain,8," more enjoyable than most critics give it credit for
","Stories about stupid criminals are funny. And when those stories are true, besides laughing, we find ourselves shaking our heads in mocking disbelief. Just think about how many times you've read such stories in an Email or heard them on the radio or on TV and how amused you were picturing what was being described. Well, ""Masterminds"" (PG-13, 1:34) brings us a true story of stupid criminals in vivid detail – helped along by some of the funniest actors in movies today – including a few ""Saturday Night Live"" veterans. This ensemble comedically dramatizes the true story of a 1997 North Carolina Loomis Fargo robbery, which remains one of the biggest heists in U.S. history. Although the script by Chris Bowman, Hubbel Palmer and Emily Spivey, along with the direction of Jared Hess (""Napoleon Dynamite"", ""Nacho Libre"") and the comic stylings of the talented cast, adds a significant amount of humor to the action, the film's story and many of its details stick very close to the facts of the case.",/review/rw7964995/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2018,cricketbat,3," The true story is more interesting than the movie
","There is something off with Masterminds. It just feels slightly off-kilter when it comes to the acting, the editing, the story and the humor -- and not in a good way. It's almost funny, but not quite. I don't recommend watching this half-baked comedy, but the true story it's based on is interesting.",/review/rw7964995/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2016,LloydBayer,4," Despite the combined comic talent, Masterminds isn't nearly as funny as it tries to be.
",There's an unwritten rule when it comes to bratpack comedies – Don't expect much wit. Masterminds has none and that's not even the biggest downside given the combined comic talent in this film.,/review/rw7964995/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2017,classicsoncall,7," ""Vaya con Dios, compadre.""
","If this is based on a true story, and it was, I can't believe a bunch of nimrods like this were able to pull it off. Coming off looking even worse to my mind was the security company Loomis Fargo, which didn't seem to have any measures in place to prevent something like this from happening. The actual robbery took place in October of 1997, so that's not that long ago for the company to have gotten with the times. Having just read a summary of that heist, the details in the film are amazingly accurate, right down to the picture of Elvis hanging over the fireplace of the Chambers home. Unbelievable.",/review/rw7964995/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2017,Reno-Rangan,7," Man tends to do crazy stuffs for a woman, but stealing $17m is too crazy.
","The film reminded me 'Pain & Gain', only for inspiring from the real and being the comedy flicks. Other than that there's nothing in common between them. I have been expecting a lot from Zack since 'The Hangover', but it was always the near missed opportunities. I'm not saying this was his much needed breakthrough, but quite enjoyable film.",/review/rw7964995/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2019,punch_p,3," Masterminds stars some of the funniest names in comedy. Too bad the movie isn't funny.
","Zach Galifianakis turns a public swimming pool brown after eating a Super Taco somewhere from a local stand in Mexico. With jokes like that, how can this movie possibly be a failure?",/review/rw7964995/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2018,iantrader,2," Funny as leprosy!
","It's a stupid story about stupid, stupid people. It's not so much comedy as poor farce and slapstick and if you get one laugh out of the movie, good luck to you. Unless you're American as many reviewer seem to be, and apologies to any Americans who really do have a sense of humour. Yeah, I'm British!",/review/rw7964995/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2016,namashi_1,5," Limited Fun!
","Despite a set of tremendous comedic actors, 'Masterminds' isn't half as funny as it ought to have been. It has some moments, but they aren't enough to pass this delayed release as a winner. ",/review/rw7964995/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2017,phd_travel,8," Funny without being crude
",I liked this comic take on a true life crime story about a bank heist. There is quite a collection of comic talent here and they are given a chance to shine as various types of white trash. ,/review/rw7964995/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2017,eddie_baggins,4," The man behind Napolean Dynamite fails again
","After his cult hit debut with Napoleon Dynamite in 2004, director Jared Hess has failed to recapture the odd brilliance of that film with uneasy comedies in the form of films like Gentleman Broncos and Nacho Libre and while the long talked about and pushed back Masterminds sounded like a film on paper perfectly suited to the filmmaker, this uneven comedy can't maximise the cast or story at its disposal to become a film of note.",/review/rw7964995/?ref_=tt_urv

","Welp, it looks like the dunderheads at the now bankrupt Relativity Media LLC. Are hell-bent in giving us yet another doozy before the year's end. What kind of rightfully shelved prattle do they have for us to mull over and regret buying a $10 ticket for this week? A Zach Galifianakis helmed caper comedy about a love-struck loser turned armored truck robber co-starring Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig and Owen Wilson? That doesn't seem so bad.",/review/rw7964995/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2016,KATO-SUBZERO,9," Funny movie, Worth the Matinée Ticket price.
","15 October 2016: Masterminds is a good funny movie, once again proving that a comedy movie can be funny without all the hard core profanity cursing in a movie. Greek American actor, Zack Galifianakis is great with all the Abbott & Costello gags. Actress, Kristen Wiig is funny, talented, sexy and cute. Owen Wilson always stands out and does a good comedy performance. The rest of the cast is ho hum boring.",/review/rw7964995/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2017,nogodnomasters,8," I'd rob a funeral home for you
","The film is based on a true story of an odd group of characters who robbed Loomis Fargo, the biggest bank heist in American history. The film centers on David Ghantt (Zach Galifianakis) who was sweet talked into the robbery by Kelly Campbell (Kristen Wiig). Steven Eugene Chambers (Owen Wilson) was the mastermind behind the robbery and failed to lay low and leave town.",/review/rw7964995/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2017,jtindahouse,4," Just not funny enough
","There are two types of comedic actors in the world. There are the ones who can adequately deliver a funny performance provided they are given a great script to work with, and then there are the geniuses who can take any material and make it hilarious regardless. Unfortunately for 'Masterminds' the cast is filled entirely with the former. Also sadly for 'Masterminds' it doesn't have a brilliant script to work with.",/review/rw7964995/?ref_=tt_urv

Three weeks later, her petty criminal friend Steve Chambers (Owen Wilson) comes up with an idea. They recruit sweet-natured David to steal from the company's vault. He cleans out $17 million. They give him fake ID Mike McKinney and send him to Mexico. FBI Agent Scanlon (Leslie Jones) leads the investigation. Steve turns David in for the reward but he manages to escape.

21 October 2016,Turfseer,4," Ineptitude of low-rent, trailer trash criminals evoke few laughs
","If you told me that Jared Hess, creator of the vastly overrated and loathsome Napoleon Dynamite, would come out 12 years later with Masterminds, a farcical take on the 1997 North Carolina Loomis Armored Car heist, I probably would have been a bit surprised. Unlike Hess' initial effort, Masterminds sports some good acting, a few likable characters (somewhat) and a plot that (very) roughly follows the machinations involved in the commission of the true-life crime.",/review/rw7964995/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2017,mddarley,8," Zach Galifianakis and other cast members were awesome
","I watched this not knowing what to expect and found myself laughing a lot and enjoying it thoroughly. I was surprised to see that it was not better received (not too surprised though, as it seems only the most popular movies get any positive reviews and there tends to be a bandwagon effect).

31 January 2017,cosmo_tiger,6," Funny in parts but really disappointing and I'm glad I waited to rent this rather than go to the theatre for it.
","""My name is David Ghantt. I always felt I was destined for a life of adventure. It didn't quite pan out that way. Then one day I met Miss Kelly Campbell."" David Ghantt (Galifianakis) works for an armored car company, is engaged to be married and is loving life. He starts to develop a little crush on his co-worker Kelly (Wiig) which results in an opportunity for one of Kelly's friends. David becomes involved in one of the biggest bank heists in US history, with no clue of what he is actually involved in. First of all I have to say that this movie was decent and I laughed a few times, but I was very disappointed. I watched Keeping Up With The Joneses which I thought was very funny, and this one was not nearly as good. The one huge saving grace of this movie was Jason Sudeikis. He saved this movie pretty much by himself. I would watch an entire movie based on that character. The rest of the movie felt a little flat and uninspired and the only thing that really kept me interested, besides Sudeikis, was that it was based on a true story and I wanted to see what actually happened. Overall, funny in parts but really disappointing and I'm glad I waited to rent this rather than go to the theatre for it. I give this a C+.",/review/rw7964995/?ref_=tt_urv

",How in the hell in a cinematic universe did Masterminds get lost in the miasma of bad comedies that keep coming out week after week? Directed by the co-mastermind (sorry!) behind Napolean Dynamite & Nacho Libre comes another inspired piece of lunacy (based on a real case) which builds & builds like a collage of hilarity.
