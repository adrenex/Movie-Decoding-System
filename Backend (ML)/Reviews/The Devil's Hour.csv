1 October 2020,siderite,7," After Michael Bay's sFX extravaganzas, a return to form: a kid oriented film actually based on the toy line
","I have never played with the toys or read the comics, but I watched all of the Transformers movies. When Bumblebee came out I was fatigued and frankly disgusted with the quality of the franchise, so I just gave up. But after a comment from a blogger, saying that the film is not directed by Bay and that it's one of the best Transformers movies, I've decided to watch it. The verdict: a return to form. The action is set in the 80s, the effects look more mechanical and less CGI and the main character is a young girl. I find it befitting to what the franchise should have been from the very start.",/review/rw4510345/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2020,Abdulxoxo,7," One of the better films in the Transformer franchise
","Bumblebee is surprisingly fantastic, it had better written humor and characters. it's a transformer movie but with heart and soul. The action sequences are excellent and had far less unnecessary explosions and better editing as you can see everything clearly. The characters are well drawn and have personality. Bumblebee is such a lovable character in this one and his dynamic duo with Charlie is just perfect. The performances are very good; Hailee Steinfeld is well-casted, and she easily carries the film. The visual effects are stunning, and the soundtrack is amazing; it has a lots of classic 80s songs that fits well with the themes presented in the movie.",/review/rw4510345/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2018,kevinxirau,8," Finally the Transformers movie we deserve.
","In 2007, Michael Bay showed the world that today's technology could bring the famed Transformers to life on the big screen. Sadly, he has the finesse of a brick to the face as his subsequent films for the most part are rusted pieces of scrap due to his crude style of filmmaking, lack of focus, and narrow demographic, leaving fans with only the 80s animated movie as the true ""good one"", that is until now.",/review/rw4510345/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2019,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," Heartwarming prequel, but the writing was too amateurish and childish
","Heartwarming story, but seems tailored to be more enjoyable to the 8-12 year old's as an upgrade from the 80's animated series. It's not your expected typical adult action filled Transformers installment. You can tell this was written by an inexperienced amateur writer, Christina Hodson. The directing was fairly decent, considering this was Animator Travis Knight's first live action film he's directed. Not sure why the producers (especially Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg) decided to cheap out on these key elements, and then have to pay for pretty much every fake 10/10 review this film has on here. The film's soundtrack was a good throwback to some good 80's songs. Hailee Steinfeld was perfect as always, but pairing her up with Jorge Lendeborg Jr. and his banana seat bike, made them both look like they were 12 years old. Although still enjoyable, I expected more. Would I recommend it? Yes for kids, not really for adults. Would I see it again? Nope, but I'm sure my 8 year old nephew will. It's a 7/10 from me.",/review/rw4510345/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2019,OMTR,9," Smells Like 1980's Spirit
","Bumblebee is the 'unofficial' sixth installment in the Transformers' franchise and it is actually a spin-off. I bought the DVD before coming back home last week, with the idea that it would be a good family movie, and I was far from being wrong. This is not only a great film to watch with the kids, but also the best episode in the saga. 'Bumblebee' takes us back to the year 1987, and it looks and smells like if it was made in the 1980s with a great cast and an awesome soundtrack. I am listening to it while I am writing this review and I am already looking forward to watching 'Bumblebee 2' in theaters in 2022.",/review/rw4510345/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2019,namashi_1,6," A Transformers Movie With Heart!
","The Transformers Movies, lets be honest aren't movies that offer soul. Despite making over billions with the Michael Bay films, Transformers are often noted to be mindless, soulless blockbusters. But with a new Director calling the shots and the focus being on just one of the Transforming Heroes, 'Bumblebee' is a pleasant surprise, that is indeed a Transformers Movie with Heart!",/review/rw4510345/?ref_=tt_urv

2 October 2019,Floated2,8," Best Transformers film
","Bumblebee lived up to its highly hype and has delivered upon its expectations. As a film what makes Bumblebee enjoyable and the best of the Transformers film is that there is enough heart, the comedy isn't forced, the characters are likable (mainly Hailee Steinfield as the lead) and the action isn't over the top.",/review/rw4510345/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2019,cardsrock,8," The best Transformers movie yet
","Just like Hailee Steinfeld sings in the end credits song, Transformers has been brought back to life. The 80s nostalgia is definitely fun, but what really makes this film is the heart and connection between Charlie and Bumblebee. Charlie is easily the most realized character in the franchise. I enjoyed the lower key approach of this film and actually being able to see what was happening during the action scenes. This was a much needed reset for the series and hopefully this level of quality will continue.",/review/rw4510345/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2019,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,9," Just what it needed: no Michael Bay directing.
","Bumblebee comes as a shocking surprise to me because up until now, ALL the Transformers movies since 2007 have given me migraines due to all the nauseating CGI (specifically the CG-robot mouths imitating human lips *ech*) that didn't know when to moderate action with character, or drama with spectacle (not drama OR spectacle). Bumblebee addresses all of those problems and then some in Travis Knight's live-action directorial debut: his second feature since Kubo and the Two Strings. Knight has given us, hands down, the BEST Transformers movie to date. Its emphasis on human-and-robot drama and galaxy-traveling and its focus on character dilemmas amidst the action (as opposed to directionless action sequences) makes this film a blast to watch.",/review/rw4510345/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2018,alesisqs61,9," Imagine if this was the very first Transformers
","This is how the first movie should have started but we can't erase history. Charlie and Bumblebee honestly have a much, much better connection together than Shia's character in Transformers. This movie is mostly about Bumblebee and her and the plot is not deep but the characters are deeper than the Bay films. It's a shame Travis Knight had felt the need to connect this film to Bay's Transformer movies because this could have been a good reboot since Transformers turned into a pile of garbage. The movie's always had some cool moments but overall they simply got worse and worse and more hype but never actually delivered the experience the fans deserved. I felt that The Last Knight was nearly unwatchable after watching it the first time. Transforming became a joke and was basically barely used anymore. The ending of this could have ushered in a new era of actual good films but since they connect to Transformers 1, we sort of get robbed of what could have become something interesting. A lot of time from the end of this until the first T1 movie transpired but Charlie basically is a one and done character which is a bummer for the franchise in my opinion but a good thing for maybe this movie as a stand alone film. I had a great time watching the film and Bumblebee does not disappoint but the only major weakness in bringing in Sector 7.... yet again tied to Transformers... uggg..... I'd have preferred the military not even be involved at all but it is what it is. I'd have also preferred more ""decepticons"" come and have Prime show up for the finale but I suppose that also sounds clich√©. Bumblebee has to be the hero of the movie as Prime is usually the hero of all the other movies. I'm just trying to say that had this not connected the others, they could have went all out but it felt a tad held back actually by the other films. That's why I took away a point. It did not suffer at all without Bay.... the style might not quiet have been as ""Hollywood"" however I think that made it a bit more 80s. His style fit the movie quiet fine. Glad I got to see this... as this wipes out the part of the bad Transformers movies. Had this been an actual reboot and had Prime come with the others, I'd have seriously given it a 10/10.",/review/rw4510345/?ref_=tt_urv

","Finally they made an actually great transformers film,Michael bay didnt get the transformers franchise at all in fact he kept ruining it every time he did another movie,after the third one i lost all hope for a good transformers film and i stop watching them(i didn't even care about trailers or anything related)but when i heard bay was out and Travis Knight was in i started to get hope so i gave this a chance to see if they could improve without bay and not only i wasn't disappointed but i got in love with this franchise again,they understand the concept of a good transformers movie(no over the top action,no oversexualized teen girls,no explosions all over the place)just a good film with a simple plot and heart.10/10",/review/rw4510345/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2018,Loving_Silence,8," Finally we get another good Transformers movie.
","Let's be honest every Transformers movie other than the first one has been bad. The 3rd one had a great third act in Chicago but that's about it. I went into this with extremely low expectations and was really surprised. I can finally say we second good Transformers movie with this standalone Bumblebee movie. This is a movie with a lot of heart and that's not just due to Bumblebee but also with the human characters. They finally got a great lead with Hailee Steinfeld who gives a damn solid performance in this. The entire cast was good no one seemed like they were phoning it in for a paycheck. The action in this movie is a major step up from the sequels, you can actually tell what's going on and the visuals are beautiful and detailed. I was ecstatic to see they went back with the first generation designs. The Transformers are characters and you feel for them. If you're a Transformers fan you have to go see this movie.",/review/rw4510345/?ref_=tt_urv

","FINALLY, we can see what's happening on the screen! My biggest complaint about the Michael Bay Transformer movies is that too much was happening on the screen at once, especially the action scenes so we couldn't even appreciate how cool the Transformers actually were.

","Hollywood touches everything it can, finding topics that can potentially be turned into a new movie franchises until every inch of profit is squeezed out. A toy series turned cartoon, that soon became a live action motion picture series that at one time blew our minds and soon blew our wallets. After many hardships, the series was about to crash and burn, until the Bay era was handed over to a new team to try and bring it back to life. Tonight, the full world release is upon us and given the trailers, can this film succeed where the others have failed?

28 December 2018,noelleinc,4," Such a waste of time
","This movie was terrible. The pacing was slow, there was no story to fill in the time, just a bunch of driving around. The family scenes were forced and I felt no connection at all to any of the characters. The love interest was incredibly lame. John Cena's character was one of a typical dumb soldier, I much prefer all of the military characters from the first movie to him. At least they were funny. Not senseless shells of dumb.",/review/rw4510345/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2018,ThomasDrufke,9," The Heart This Series Has Been Missing
","I'm one of those guys who actually likes the first and third Transformers films, but the other 3 are some of the worst films ever made. However, after what the last two have brought, I was admittedly done with anything related to Autobots and Decepticons. Then, the first trailer for Bumblebee comes out and I was surprisingly intrigued. Maybe that was the lack of Michael Bay's presence felt or that Travis Knight brilliantly directed Kubo a few years ago. Either way, it felt like it's own thing, and the film lived up to those hopes. It's pretty close to a replica of The Iron Giant in many ways, but its heart and charm are something that Transformers films have been missing for a long time. I'm not going to care about the big robot action if I don't first care about all the characters, and Bumblebee hits on all those accounts. Hailee Steinfeld is the best lead the series has ever had, and even John Cena had some solid moments in the midst of a well-structured action film as well. I can't believe I'm saying this, but Bumblebee is one of the best films of the year.",/review/rw4510345/?ref_=tt_urv

","I gotta say, Hailee Steinfeld did the best job in the film with every single shot they show in the movie, and it has a perfect story, tons of Action, Funny Scenes, and every beautiful moments, and this movie had brought me as the Transformers fan ""Back to Life"". I'm glad we all have to thank Steven Spielberg to produce BUMBLEBEE, because he did Directed E.T. the Extra Terrestrial, and it had reminded me how Bumblebee had that moment. It had like E.T. and The Iron Giant. Now that... is the Best Transformers Movie we've all been waiting for. Take that Michael Bay!! Dont give me wrong, the first one is good, not gonna lie, but the sequels, I have to agree that one of them went down at the Box Office.",/review/rw4510345/?ref_=tt_urv
