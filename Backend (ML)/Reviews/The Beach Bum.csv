13 January 2021,Supermanfan-13,8," I can't believe I just started watching this now!
","I've always heard great things about Chuck and read all the great reviews and ratings but still put off watching it for some reason. I thought I'd finally give it chance and I'm glad I did because I enjoyed it a lot. It has everything you want in a good tv show...comedy, action, drama, mystery, romance, etc, etc. I now know why Chuck's fan base was always so loyal and loud about bringing it back.",/review/rw2771377/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2009,kcdl,10," Very Enjoyable if you take it for what it is.
",I'm totally surprised by the amount of negative comments made about Chuck. though at the same time the good comments are very good.,/review/rw2771377/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Such a fun show!
","I'm actually blown away by how much I liked the show Chuck! I never watched it when it was on but had time of the pandemic and finally caught up. I loved it! It's about a computer geek named Chuck Bartowski (Zachary Levi) as he accidentally downloaded a secret weapon that downloades massive amounts of critical information to his brain, everything from terrorists to look out for, how to learn to fight, fix things, fly, or whatever else he needs in a matter of seconds. Assassins and terrorists all over the world try to get to him to get that information. He works alongside CIA agent Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski) and Major John Casey (Adam Baldwin) to protect this secret and to get the bad guys. If you haven't seen this yet don't be like me and keep putting it off, make it's your next show to watch. You won't be disappointed!",/review/rw2771377/?ref_=tt_urv

21 July 2021,atjudkins,10," The first show I ever really fell in love with
","When I was about 7 or 8 me and my dad were channel surfing one night and we caught the 2nd or 3rd episode of chuck. Every week we sat down together to watch it and by the time season 1 ended my brother, sister and mom had all migrated into the living room on nights it was on. Every week from 2007 to 2012 we all sat down together and watched it and every one of us loved it. But, enough of what it means to me, on to what it is.",/review/rw2771377/?ref_=tt_urv

11 August 2009,fearcheol,10," Chuck is like Marmite.....you either love it or hate it. I LOVE IT!
",A lot of people who watch Chuck forget that they are watching a action/comedy. The people who think that its supposed to be solely comedy will be disappointed because they think they're supposed to be laughing the whole time. These people aren't the fans....,/review/rw2771377/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2022,kanstense11,10," Chuck!

12 July 2022,BadurBey,10," Top 5 greatest show of all time
",Chuck is one of the greatest shows I have ever watched. From beginning to end I was instantly captivated. Rewatched this show over 6 times and each time I felt like I was watching for the first time. S Tier show.,/review/rw2771377/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2022,docm-32304,9," Love this series
","If you have had difficulty finding a series with action, comedy and none of the current vulgarities...this series is for you. Chuck is a very likeable character and certainly holds this production together. His nerd cohorts are hilarious, although sometimes you just want to slap the lazy idiocy out of his best friend Morgan. Casey and Sarah round out the great cast with their different ways of operating as spies. Everyone in our house is thoroughly enjoying each episode which is hard to find these days. The absence of f-bombs is truly refreshing. I would highly recommend this series and it's longevity testifies to the quality of the writing and acting. Well done...we want to see more like this.",/review/rw2771377/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,alsith,9," Good balance between humour and serious.
",This is a gem that kept me entertained for years.,/review/rw2771377/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2009,vishak_14,10," great show!very funny!
","I think this is the only TV show that had me hooked after just the first episode...I've watched a lot of TV shows and i would have to say that this is definitely the funniest of them...everyone has a different sense of humor..the previous post mentioned that this show wasn't funny...shocking to me..but oh well..people are different...humor aside, it's action packed and has it's serious moments (well serious until chuck arrives on the scene)...the fact that he doesn't mean to be funny makes it even funnier(if that makes any sense)...there's also some love triangle stuffs which in fact is one of the main things that makes you wanna keep watching(well.. me anyway)..I really do recommend watching this series(not one a week..just get the DVD and watch one episode after the other..makes it more enjoyable)..",/review/rw2771377/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2012,Wustmann,10," Don't let season 5 be the last of Chuck and Sarah!!!!!!!!
","Chuck is unique. It is real. With the corny acting, the monotonous or bizarre plots, and the horrible story lines have claimed the life of too many of today's television shows, Chuck offers a refreshing plot, real emotion, and real problems. The ingenious plot uniquely blends action and drama with comedy and romance. The importance of the intersect on Chuck's life and how it changes him makes us look at our own lives and makes us wonder what it is that we want to get out of our lives. Adding to that the incredibly passionate and emotional love story of Chuck and Sara and discovering the importance of family (the Bartowski's) and friends (Morgan, Casey, Buy More Gang), watching Chuck makes you realize what really matters in life and makes you feel like part of a family, Chuck's family.

28 October 2014,theneilrules,10," Phenomenal
","This show is a perfect mix - romance, drama, action and comedy in a blender. Not many shows will keep you at the edge of your seats. Chuck is truly an epic, in fact, it is the best action comedy series ever. Both the lead characters fit perfectly. The chemistry between Strahovski and Levi is unparalleled. The main charisma of this show is just one. Amongst the action and comedy sequences, the allurement to watching this show is the constant advancement of the relationship between Chuck and Sarah. How they would eventually end up with their romance. The rest of the cast provided enough laughter to fuel up this magical journey. 91 episodes just ended in a flash.",/review/rw2771377/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2020,kmarsha-43002,10," Great to binge watch during the pandemic!
","My hubby and I binge watched the entire series in just a few weeks! I was hooked from the 1st episode and never got bored! Stick with it! It's a face paced show and if you're like me, you'll think 91 episodes is not enough/",/review/rw2771377/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2022,omidtafakori,9," Pure nostalgia in 2022
","I remember when I was a kid, maybe around 9 or 10 during the first seasons of the show, I used to wake up every morning in Malmö, my hometown in Sweden and watch Chuck. I remember it being some of the best things I've watched. I decided to revisit the old show some 15 years after the first season aired and it still holds up. I remember watching episode 10, season 1 and No one's gonna love you by Band of Horses started playing, and for a moment, just a small moment my eyes started filling up with tears. I started to remember the good old days when I was a little kid watching this show, when things were much simpler.",/review/rw2771377/?ref_=tt_urv

","Life can be funny when you plan to make a mark on the world, but circumstances get in the way. It can be also be dangerous. In the case of the sci-fi- action comedy series, ""Chuck"", it's both at the same time, an entertaining mix.",/review/rw2771377/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2019,cjonesas,10," My life will never be the same again after Chuck
","Besides the horrible final two episodes, in which I got to see Sarah as an emotionless person, without her awesome smile, kindness and concern, the very bad ending left a lot to desire. The matter that annoys me the most was that Yvonne having all those superb qualities (beauty, charisma, chemistry, height, figure, dancing like a queen, fighting like a tigress) decided to throw all that away and play parts and roles which could be performed by anyone. I discovered Chuck very late and my life will never be the same again. It is the most beautiful series that I have ever watched. The chemistry between them, the superb acting, the wonderful cast, the joy and happiness that I still feel from the series , I never felt it in any series. The one only coming a little close was Stranger Things.",/review/rw2771377/?ref_=tt_urv

28 January 2012,ArrrMadeus,10," Chuck Finale
","Okay, for starters. Chuck has always been one of those shows that no matter where you pop in to it, it will be an exciting television show. Chuck offers a lot of fun, it offers you comedy, drama, and there are a lot of touching moments throughout the show. I, as a male, can honestly say that the Finale has made me cry like a baby. I have loved this show since the beginning of its airing, and there is nothing I want more than this show to continue. Unfortunately, I don't think it's going to be continued; but they may make a movie about it. If none of you have watched Chuck, or gave up on it, I suggest you continue, (or start), watching the show. It's a touching show, it's by far number one in the top ten most amazing shows, it HAS to be. When you watch the Series finale, you'll be tearing up.",/review/rw2771377/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2022,va3lim,9," Very funny & entertaining
","If you like a spy story with plenty of laughters, love, fun and misadventures, don't miss Chuck. It's a Must Watch TV show!",/review/rw2771377/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2022,jennifer_duval,8," ""Spies""
","I like this show a lot, especially the actors and the humor. But I find it distracting how often they refer to themselves as ""spies."" I don't think actual clandestine agents throw that word around so much.",/review/rw2771377/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2007,nunyerbiz,5," Chuck might have some potential underneath the muddled scripts
","Through a series of 'forgettable spy movie clichés', a regular guy from the local electronic store gets all the secrets of the government downloaded into his subconscious. Of course, this brings interest from the unavoidable 'powerful government agency clichés'. The CIA agent (romantic interest) and the NSA agent (sorta pointless other guy) must sorta protect him while sorta trying to get information from him while sorta trying to make the audience laugh on occasion.",/review/rw2771377/?ref_=tt_urv

23 March 2013,Anoke,10," The Best TV Series Ever
","Chuck is the best TV series EVER and here is why. First of all it has very positive energy. In the times of making you feel bad & sad series and depressing series and plain out boring series, and ugly series, Chuck's creators were bold enough to go for series with very strong positive message, something that gives you a warm, good feeling every time you watch it. It's a great thing to see a series so positive, so energetic, so feel-good. Secondly Chuck has amazing actors - main and supportive, they are g-r-e-a-t!!! It's hard not to like Chuck and Sarah and the rest of the gang. Thirdly this series has amazingly written scripts and know how to reinvents itself like every season. Fourthly there are tons of very cool references in the series. And last but not least the guest stars are absolutely fantastic!",/review/rw2771377/?ref_=tt_urv
