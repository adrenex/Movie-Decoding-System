18 January 2023,spasticfreakshow,7," surprising in a good way - NOT the formulaic Hallmark family drama
","With the mother (Kat, played by Chyler Leigh - you'll recognize her as Supergirl's sister, but less annoying in this role) and daughter Alice both suddenly at loose ends, a surprising note arrives, which seems to be from Kat's mother Del (the lovely Andie MacDowell who elevates the show with her presence and gifted talents) telling her it's time to come home. Kat and Alice are displaced in short order and wind up in a small town where everyone knows everything, and you suspect that before long, everyone's problems will be sorted, like laundry that just gets done on a farm.",/review/rw8808378/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,feeko-62726,9," Definitely worth watching!
",First.. I am going to politely disagree with the other reviews of The Way Home. To say after one episode you won't watch is being a little ridiculous.,/review/rw8808378/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,MichaelByTheSea,10," The best series I've ever watched on Hallmark. Utterly enthralling.
","The worst thing about the show is that it's over too soon and you have to wait an entire week to watch the next episode. We've all been so spoiled with all the binge watching on all the streaming services, but the fact that I can't wait to see the next episode is why this is an easy 10 for me so far.",/review/rw8808378/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2023,lorrainedesormeaux,9," I want to see more
","It looks so good I can't wait for the 2nd episode, we don't know if she goes back that's what we have to learn, how does she control where she goes, was the witch her grandma, there's so many questions that need to be answered and I hope the best friend and the mom get together as much more than friends I hope they make it interesting the rest of the story, the young girl is a good actress. I hope that eventually the mom travels back maybe they can travel together to a past of her mom it would make it interesting there so many stories that could come out of this I hope the story writer gets very good ideas it would make the program interesting.",/review/rw8808378/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2023,garysteinweg,5," Quite Complicated, Gonna Give It A Little More time
","OK, so what we have here is a time-travel series. I love time travel movies - and series. Unfortunately, when it comes to series, they don't last very long, usually just one season. There have been rare exceptions.",/review/rw8808378/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,cgvsluis,4," Two episodes in and I'd like to support Hallmark's attempt at something new, but this show is too depressing and moving too slowly.
",I really would like to support Hallmark trying something new...but I am struggling to enjoy this totally morose story that doesn't seem to be going anywhere.,/review/rw8808378/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2023,gen-10830,10," It's so heartwarming
",I really like it!,/review/rw8808378/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2023,k-bruffett,5," Just can't do it
","I'm only three episodes in and just can't do it anymore. The storyline is overly dramatic, the actress that plays Alice is annoying, and I just don't see how they can keep the storyline going for one season, much less more than that. I think this would have been better as a movie...with better actors...better writing...well, better everything. I guess I'm past the point where I actually want to watch teenage angst shows. Sorry, but this is a no go for me. If Hallmark is going to do serialized television, they need to make it quality and worthwhile watching. I've been disappointed lately with their shows and miss the days of Cedar Cove and Good Witch.",/review/rw8808378/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2023,kiraanne-35080,1," Dark and depressing
",The show starts with a witch being chased through the woods and then jumping into a pond. Fast forward to current day when a mother (Kat) and daughter (Alice) move back home with Kat's mother (Del). There is nothing but drama between the mothers and daughters.,/review/rw8808378/?ref_=tt_urv
