4 September 2012,phd_travel,9," The most meaningful family show on TV right now
",This is probably the most meaningful of the ABC family shows. Pretty Little Liars is entertaining but shallower by comparison.,/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2011,thereflex,10," A promising start
","This TV series shows promise. The actors are fine and the character development and premise of the story is quite involving. If the writers consistently produce solid scripts and story arcs, this show should do well. The idea of the switched at birth formula mixed with the prince and the pauper fable (and the deaf girl embellishment) makes for a rather refreshing plot backdrop. With this set up, they can go anywhere and everywhere with it. Also, there are many details that can make for interesting plot situations, ethnic and cultural diversity, economic class disparity, family situations (one doesn't have a father, the other has a grandmother), so many different things that the writers can play off of. It's good that neither of the two girls are super famous actresses. It would take away attention from the story. The writers have also avoided falling into the stereotypical clich√© of everything involved with race and economic diversity. It would be great if the show concentrates on the human drama and that it stays away from politically correct preaching. On the whole, the show does indeed show promise.",/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2011,lcampbell022892,10," Beautifully Acted and Written
","I rarely begin to follow a television show while it is in its first season for fear that it will be canceled. Yet this one drew me in and I cannot get enough of it. The idea of being switched at birth is so bizarre, and the dynamics of both families are so real. The raw emotion and feelings portrayed by these characters makes me feel sorry for and sometimes resent them all at the same time. The drama always keeps me eager to see what will happen on the next episode. The writers may have struck gold with this one.",/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2011,specklescit,8," Better than most ABCFamily shows
","When I saw the first commercial for this show, my interest was piqued. I admit it, I've always been interested in this type of storyline. not exactly ""feel good"" subjects, but fascinating nonetheless. But then I remembered the network this show is on. It's not bad in and of itself, but when I look at The Secret Life of the American Teenager -- another show I thought had an intriguing plot but was ruined quickly with horrible acting and unrealistic story lines -- and I got a little bit leery.

11 February 2012,Paranoia_RockNRoller,8," A surprisingly good show
",I had a bias the Switched would be like the other ABCfam TV shows... dull and boring with reeeeaaally bad acting and unrealistic plot lines.,/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2017,Bryan-,7," I liked it at first
","From the first episode the deaf angle felt fresh. After that fades you're left with exactly what you expect from ABC family. I'm almost done with season 4 but I mentally checked out halfway through 3. It's predictable to the core. Someone finds out something and they eventually spill their guts for the sake of drama. You get a lot of ""protect you"" lines. If you like to see people blowing things out of proportion this would be a good show for you.",/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2012,rebecca-johnson-298-109713,10," Finally..a storyline about the Deaf
","As a Deaf woman who rarely watches any television shows, because CC is not always accurate, and it gets tiring trying to figure out what is being said in English, I have to applaud the writers and producers of this show. Thank you for *finally* bringing a show to television that incorporates the 3rd largest language in Canada (behind English and French) and 3rd largest language in America (behind English and Spanish) into a television show.",/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2011,Starlitelet,9," Currently the best family show out there in a long time!
","Not only is Switched at Birth (one of) the best family show out there right now, but it's also easily one of the best standalone shows. The concept of the hearing world clashing with the deaf/non-hearing world is truly original and riveting. After the premise, I knew the show had great potential to captivate/hook viewers, but then again it could be disappointing if they wasted such a great concept by taking wrong turns. And fortunately enough, I was taken by surprise.",/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2015,riverzak,2," Started good then faded fast
","I had high hopes for this show when it first started. For the first couple of seasons it was interesting and I thought they handled the deaf thing very well. It didn't feel preachy and was a natural part of the show. I thought it was a nice touch that when the deaf people were ""talking"", most of the background sounds were muted (and the background music was stopped). It really helped to see the scene from the ""deaf"" perspective.",/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2015,jonnithomas,3," If you like stereotypes you will love this
",It's sugar sweet and so unrealistic. This is a pity as the basic idea of two babies swapped at birth by a hospital error has actually happened.,/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2014,Shopaholic35,7," Quite good but it sometimes has too much going on.
","Switched At Birth is a fairly good show with a great concept that has been fairly well executed but there is just something that makes me not love this show. There is so much going on with the hospital switch, new boyfriends every week, friend drama, sport drama, parental drama, rebelling drama mixed in with occasional sign language use and honestly I am exhausted. It's so hard to focus on the storyline as it seems to change every week. Sometimes the storyline doesn't have a chance to be explored properly as they are on to the next idea.",/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2011,eldestjay,7," Surprisingly Charming
","The thing that attracted me to this show was, of course, the title. ""Pretty original"" I thought. As far as I knew, no one else had ever tried to tackle such a profound subject. And yes, the subject is profound. Think about it. What if that happened to you? However, I was troubled when I heard the show was one of the many new shows that ABC Family was adding to their list. Why was I troubled? Because the day before, I had experienced the horror that is Cyberbully. But that's another story, and another review. But, I pushed through my doubts, and watched the pilot of Switched at Birth.",/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2011,abovethestars,10," Beautiful heartwarming show!
","This is one of the finest show I have ever seen. Really! It is heartwarming, funny, empathic, sweet and simply beautiful. I adore it, and I adore the people in it. The characters are great, the plot is great and the acting is even greater. You will get impressed! ",/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2012,ItsChanaka,8," 11 stars out of 10
","I'm not a fan of much family TV series. But this took me off the habit. It's one of the best series I have ever watched. Story is centered round two kids whose Switched at birth (Just as the Title suggest). One of them been Def take us all to a whole new society which we are yet to shed some light and discover. How they handle the hardships thrown on them by the ""Hearing"" - Society and so on. Whole story-line is so flawless and It will grab your interest from the 1st episode. It's really depressing that they take so much time to complete this season but it's really worth the wait. Hope I will see more of this in upcoming years and hope that it will never loose its present quality!",/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2013,amberm18,8," A great peek into the world of the deaf.
","A great family drama about two families that get extremely close fast, after finding out their two daughters were switched at birth. There are so many themes happening and being played out well. Being switched at birth, how each person feels. The daughters want to get to know the new mothers and see how they could have grown up, the parents want to scope each other out, blame each other and themselves. The first two series mainly focus on the switch and the identity crises that this causes the two girls. I began watching for this but I stayed for the deaf scenes.",/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2011,mirandacrs,8," I love this show.
","I liked this after the first five minutes. A very well executed, and very well played out series. Every one of the characters can act very well, and the emotions are so real, and I'm so drawn to the show. I make time to watch it every week. I will more than likely be a fan of the show for as long as it lasts. The actress who plays Daphne, is AMAZING. She is not really deaf in real life, but she is so convincing, and I actually forget that she is just an actress. Honestly, this is the most realistic show that ABC Family has ever made. It's funny, sweet, and really raises awareness to what deaf kids in America really go through. I really underestimated all of the abilities that deaf kids have. But, this show has opened my eyes, and it is pure, great entertainment, and I know I will always be a fan.",/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2020,m-47826,4," Loved it at first.
","The actors, the bound between characters, the fact that they learned to live with their differences. It even made me want to learn sign language. Only the wholesomeness of the show, made way for more biases. Where bad guys were people going against the motion. Season 4 was its downfall. Storylines got more and more ridiculous when it wanted to address social issues, in the most black and white way possible. But I guess that's just how teen dramas roll these days... I've watched the whole series, got most of its music, and was glad to see actors I knew make appearances. But I got disappointed and annoyed with the way it tuned out to be another show where writers wanted you to think a certain way about certain things...",/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2013,pianys,7," ASL for Dummies:-)
","After watching Switched at Birth since the start, I have come to realize that the series is more about being deaf in America, than being, well, switched at birth. And I really like that. More shows should explore what most people consider just a way to cope with a handicap, but what actually is its own culture and a beautiful form of expression. After reading the reviews and comments, I've come to understand that I am not the only one actually learning a bit of sign language, simply from checking out a cute and entertaining family show.",/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2017,SnoopyStyle,7," good TV family drama
","Bay Kennish (Vanessa Marano) never felt right with her rich conservative parents. Her mother Kathryn (Lea Thompson) doesn't get her artistic side. Her father John (D.W. Moffett) is a former Royals pitcher and owns several car washes. Her brother Toby (Lucas Grabeel) is the trouble-making musician. She suggests a DNA test which shocks the family. They discover that Bay and another baby was switched at birth. The other girl, Daphne Vasquez (Katie Leclerc), is deaf. She lives in a rough neighborhood with her mother Regina Vasquez (Constance Marie) and grandmother. She goes to a deaf school with her best friend Emmett Bledsoe (Sean Berdy) whose mother is Melody (Marlee Matlin). Regina is about to move out of town when everybody agrees to have the Vasquez move into the Kennish guest house.",/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2021,laragi,2," It's my duty to review this
",I wasn't going to say anything until I saw the high reviews. Has everyone gone mad? This is complete BAD FANTASY. Disney meets the deaf community. I will never be this desperate again to watch anything. Just a pile of GARBAGE.,/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2015,elise_7,2," Started off Good
","There was so much potential for this show, dealing with the two girls and family realizing that they were switched at birth. On top of the fact, dealing with the different social-economic status, and one of the girls are deaf. Now they are going down a slippery slope that they cannot go back and fix. It has turned into a typical teen drama that focus on loose morals, that has the teen do selfish things, where they do not have to truly deal with consequences of their actions. This show is like many newer shows centered around teens, and does not teach them anything truly moral. I just cannot get into this show anymore, it used to be as I stated about family, and is too much about teens doing selfish spoiled things, that most teens would not do, and if they did would not get away with it. Yes they add in the family eventually dealing with the issues from the mess that the teens got them into. I really dislike how most shows now are showing how loose morals are ""correct"" morals. What happened to shows to being about family, rather than about drama to be interesting. I guess I am outdated soul, which in my opinion this world and writer of TV shows needs.",/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2013,brooklyn-polen77,6," good ASL
",I've been taking ASL for awhile. The deaf community and the ability to communicate with your hands is so amazing. And now finally a show that uses that without over doing anything. Its the perfect mix of signing and voicing. I'm glued to the TV and am like a little kid with a book. I stay up all night watching it and screaming at the TV. About it. Its addicting and fun to watch. Although sometimes you can see some stuff happening from a mile away. Just wanna say I miss wilkie with my heart! Bring him back!!!!!!!!! He made the show a 10.! I love how they have a realistic plot and the acting is superb. I've noticed that the characters seem to grow and change and the director seems to embrace that rather than hide it unlike in some movies/ shows where they cover up that extra winkle or the weight gain or the grey hairs. This director shows it and it makes you feel more connected to the characters and helps you feel like the story is moving along. Can't for the next episode.,/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv

15 August 2011,minesweeper-real,," Deaf actors make show interesting
","This is not the type of show I normally watch - since it is basically a teen soap opera. However, this show involves a subject I am interested in, deafness. I am very interested to see how the show continues to deal with and showcase deaf issues. They have already talked about cochlear implants, the importance of learning to sign, and speech therapy. In the most recent episode there was a point that showed how Emmet sees and hears the hearing world. I hope they continue to show the deaf perspective while interacting with the hearing. Also in the episode, I loved the scene where Daphne and Emmet have an argument completely in sign and we get to read the captions. I love watching two native ""speakers"" signing. I do hope that the writers of the show do not get too sidetracked into the soap opera story lines.",/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2013,Forgotten_Conscience_Productions,8," Could you live with being Switched at Birth?
","Quite a few TV shows recently have taken something of a soap opera approach to storytelling when it comes to creating their basis for their ideas. Most notably there are shows like Pretty Little Liars which focuses on the problems you run into while lying coupled with a murder mystery plot, Ringer which was about a twin who took over her sister's life to escape her own problems, and Switched at Birth, the story of two families who took home each other's daughters, only to discover the truth almost 16 years later.",/review/rw2811812/?ref_=tt_urv
