27 November 2019,Calicodreamin,7," Pretty good
","Overall I thought this was a pretty good action thriller. While the storyline was a bit simplistic and predictable, the execution was top notch. Boseman played the part of hardened cop really well, and the supporting characters held their own. The storyline had good flow and kept up a good pace throughout. Enjoyable and worth the time to watch.",/review/rw7594350/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2019,harry_tk_yung,," One hell of a tight script
","Many may have come just to see Chadwick Boseman and they shouldn't be disappointed. But there are other good things about this movie. It has one hell of a tight script. Throughout the 100 minutes runtime, there is not a single wasted, idle shot (no pun intended). There is also a good supporting cast, which I'll come to later.",/review/rw7594350/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2019,subxerogravity,6," Tight action movie.
","I thought it was pretty thrilling and suspenseful police drama, that went fast enough not to bore me.
I found the production to be pretty big with the whole thing about the movie being produced by the same guys who made Avengers: End game and it has a decent set of actors in it, but you're not going to get any substance from it. No depth just action. It has a message but the message does not out weight the dramatic action sequences. The Russo brothers could have done so much more with what they were given but they didn't.
And is that what Chadwick Boseman really sounds like? I herd him mimic so many famous black people that I had no idea what he actually sounds like.
Anyway. It's a good popcorn eating action movie. It's not met to win awards just make you satisfied when spending the two hours to see it.",/review/rw7594350/?ref_=tt_urv

16 August 2020,bob the moo,," Distracting but hard not to be disappointed with how much effort went into everything but the writing (SPOILERS LIKE I'M TO BLAME)
","There's a cop in NY who we are shown very early on is a through-and-through proper cop; yes he has killed in the line of duty but they were all good kills and no issues. Unrelated to this, a drug robbery goes very badly when a load of police turn up, and the thieves have to shoot their way out. Our good cop turns up to take action, supported by some bosses who are played by some instantly recognisable actors, and he is assigned a partner who again is played by the level of actress that is unlikely to be attracted to just a 'female sidekick' character. From the start it seemed pretty clear that this will be about one good cop taking on dirty cops and that at least some of the well-known actors will suddenly turn out to be baddies - I flagged this comment a spoiler because of that sentence, but it seemed obvious from about 10 minutes in, and indeed that is how it played out.",/review/rw7594350/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2020,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," Nothing new, but still enjoyable
","Aside from being very predictable, Chadwick Boseman was ""too much"" in his character and very melodramatic, as was the score during highlighted scenes. Otherwise, the directing was on point, the casting great, and the run-time and pacing perfect. I enjoyed it more than I thought. 7/10 from me",/review/rw7594350/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2020,kosmasp,7," Predictable but enjoyable
","I don't think there are many things that will be open or rather not openly foreseeable for most of the viewers. I did have one character reveal that I did not think about, but other than that ... But as it is, this movie works as a thriller, even when you know what's up.",/review/rw7594350/?ref_=tt_urv

","When two cop killers are on the loose with 50 kilograms of uncut cocaine, detective Andre Harris (Chadwick Boseman) makes the bold move of cutting off their exit from Manhattan by blocking its 21 bridges--hence the title. I doubt a detective would have that much authority but nevermind that.",/review/rw7594350/?ref_=tt_urv

","Two men hold up and rob an illegal drug operation but in order to escape end up killing eight police officers. Leading the manhunt for the cop-killers is a detective under internal investigation for possibly being too trigger-happy.

7 February 2020,redrobin62-321-207311,7," Not Bad, Actually.
","Even though I saw them two days apart, ""Black and Blue"" could be called the younger brother of ""21 Bridges"" - two police thrillers set in an urban environment dealing with corrupt cops who get taken down by both violence from an angel black cop along with info on an external drive. A lot more money was spent on ""21 Bridges"", though, and it shows. Unfortunately, like ""Black and Blue"", it has its flaws; still, it made for an enjoyable, adrenaline-filled evening for a popcorn rush.",/review/rw7594350/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2019,timucin_savas,7," Not bad I guess!
","The film was a pleasant surprise. Nothing new here but the camera work and action scenes were marvelous. Although the plot is not original the story was fine with good editing. Interesting take on ""Manhattan island"", however the script could have been better and acting was average at times. Nice Friday night flick!",/review/rw7594350/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2019,masonsaul,8," Great crime thriller
","21 Bridges is a great crime thriller that's tense and thrilling and also manages to (surprisingly) explore some morally grey aspects, despite it's generic plot. Chadwick Boseman gives a great lead performance. Taylor Kitsch and Stephan James are also great and Sienna Miller and J. K. Simmons are both really good. Brian Kirk's direction is excellent, keeping the film constantly moving and mobile, resulting in a great pace. The shootouts are well filmed and thrilling. The music by Henry Jackman and Alex Belcher is fantastic.",/review/rw7594350/?ref_=tt_urv

21 March 2020,danielcereto,6," Good cop thriller
",Here we have same old story of dirty cops and a robbery. So not original but the acting is solid and the scenography is pretty good. So overall only a good thriller because it's lack of originality and predictable script and twists. It could be far better.,/review/rw7594350/?ref_=tt_urv

8 December 2019,UniqueParticle,8," Great suspense action flick!
","A bit sloppy but great twists and adrenaline filled ride! Chadwick Bosman is so awesome as the good cop, the bulk of the film is intense and it has you continuously wanting to know what happens next. J.K. Simmons is great as always so is everyone else. I would highly recommend 21 Bridges for fans of crime/action genres.",/review/rw7594350/?ref_=tt_urv

29 June 2021,Leofwine_draca,8," Quality action thriller
","A decent thriller from Amazon. Nothing special or stupendous but solidly watchable, and engrossing from beginning to end. Just the kind of popcorn movie that Hollywood has been so good at making over the years. Nice to see Chadwick Boseman outside of a superhero movie and he acquits himself well with his serious lead, although he was looking severely ill at this point. I was never a fan of Sienna Miller but others like JK Simmons are fine. Not a huge amount of action but one innovative chase sequence and lots of peril and suspense along the way, along with a fast pace that drops you in at the deep end and doesn't surface until the very end.",/review/rw7594350/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2019,pete-470,7," Worth spending a few notes to see
","This is the type of film I've seen a hundred times or more on DVD, Netflix etc, but for some reason never think of going to see at the cinema. Our multiplex is getting renovated so they're a few screens down and when we got down there it was the only thing about to start in the next half hour. It's not going to win awards but it will entertain you.. it's not really going to keep you guessing but you will want to see how it pans out. It's not going to stay in my memory but it does make me want to see more of this type at the cinema rather than at home. Good, honest film.",/review/rw7594350/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2019,muamba_eats_toast,8," Above average
",Just enough twists and unpredictability to make this better than most cop thrillers. Whilst some of it is pretty simple the lead performance is great and it's pacing is pretty much perfect. Much better than average if unfortunately not spectacular.,/review/rw7594350/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2020,MAYESY-44,9," Bridge the gap
",Really good action movie with a really good cast. I thought the story was really good and the action on it was some of the best I've seen in a film recently. The only minor downside was the unnecessary background music that didn't fit with the film and was a bit annoying in parts.,/review/rw7594350/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2019,tulipwoodland,8," Predictable Yet Engrossing
","This Chadwick Bose man film is gripping thriller and there is no time you will feel bored watching it. The treatment to such a simple script which falls short due to its predictability is overcome by stinctilating cinematography, memorable well written characters and a believable premise set in Manhattan New York. The Climax tells a bigger picture of the cops world giving us a glimpse of the system as a whole with Stephan James and Chadwick Boseman leaving an impact with their honest performances. Give it a Watch for sure.",/review/rw7594350/?ref_=tt_urv
