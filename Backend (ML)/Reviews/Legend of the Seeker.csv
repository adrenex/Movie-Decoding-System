19 June 2015,Red-Barracuda,8," A very worthy attempt at bringing the Amy Winehouse story to the screen
","I remember when Amy Winehouse died back in 2011 it had a certain inevitability about it yet was still shocking and very sad. The media had made a meal out of her problems documenting them at every given opportunity and her increasingly emancipated appearance was publicised for all to see, courtesy of the lowlifes of the paparazzi. Hers was life in a goldfish bowl by the end and for a person who never wanted fame in the first place; this made her life all the more difficult. What complicated matters so fatally was that in amongst all of this, she had a predisposition for drink and drugs. The combination sent her spiralling on a downward trajectory.",/review/rw3355210/?ref_=tt_urv

14 July 2015,rubenm,8," Who killed Amy?
","The cover story of this week's edition of music magazine NME is: 'Who killed Amy?' It would have been a perfect title for this superb documentary. I went to see it, hoping it would answer two questions. One: could Amy Winehouse's death have been prevented in any way? Two: if so, by whom? The film provides crystal clear answers to both questions. One: no, it probably couldn't have been prevented - at best it could have been postponed. Two: several members of her entourage have probably contributed to her downward spiral. Her father, who wasn't there when he should be and was there when he shouldn't. Her husband, who encouraged her drugs abuse and seems to be an utterly despicable person. And the press, who relentlessly haunted her and enjoyed every misstep in her life. But the documentary also makes one thing very clear: in the end there's only one person responsible for Amy Winehouse's death: Amy Winehouse.",/review/rw3355210/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2015,rick_7,," An extraordinary film, one of the most powerful I've seen in years
","A haunting, heartbreaking and stunningly brilliant film from Senna director Asif Kapadia, which takes us into the confidence of Amy Winehouse, as the bolshy, big-voiced, jazzy Jewish girl from North London becomes a megastar, while her personal demons, her relationship with a drug addict, and a ravenous, amoral press proceed to rip her to shreds.",/review/rw3355210/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2015,Avwillfan89,10," A whole new Amy
","This documentary is presented in an unusual way: using only footage of Amy's home videos, photos, interviews, live performances and voice-overs only for interviews from Amy and the people who knew her best. It certainly makes a nice change from the numerous camera interviews, mixed with footage of the documentary's subject. It's intimate, raw, sympathetic and heartbreaking. With so much footage of her, in the end, you feel like you really knew her. And it's absolutely gut-wrenching when she dies. ",/review/rw3355210/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2015,themadmovieman,8," Heartbreaking and captivating depiction of the life of an incredible talent
","This is a fascinating and heartbreakingly sad and dark depiction of the life of a brilliant singer. It's a touching testament to Winehouse's career, relationships and ups and downs, and it takes a very dramatic but powerful approach to telling the story in Asif Kapadia's inventive documentary style.",/review/rw3355210/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2015,andre_andreas1987,10," Fantastic, Honest and Raw
","This is one of the best documentaries that I have seen because its not meant to be flashy and ""entertaining"". It is a very honest and emotional movie with personal clips that show her rise to fame and her feelings about it. One of the biggest reasons why I loved it was because all the different sides of her life were presented in the movie. I loved how all the opposing sides agreed to come together and make this amazing movie. Her parents, managers, ex husband were all included, even though they probably hate one another in real life. I also liked how they included full songs in the documentary. I was a big fan of Amy Winehouse before but this movie made me appreciate her personality and clever poetry. Highly recommended. trust.",/review/rw3355210/?ref_=tt_urv

30 October 2015,l_rawjalaurence,8," Familiar Story with an Incredibly Poignant Twist
","Asif Kapadia's documentary tells a familiar tale of the life and death of Amy Winehouse - a precocious talent from North London with a unique vocal and songwriting talent destroyed by a combination of willful manipulation, drugs and drink. The same could also be said for other great jazz singers of the past, notably Billie Holiday (whose voice often seems eerily similar to Winehouse's).",/review/rw3355210/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2015,Quinoa1984,7," Jazz Singer Sings the Blues
","Amy Winehouse started as a jazz singer - her idols, we learn in this documentary Amy, were Sarah Vaughn and Tony Bennett - and actually looked down on a lot of pop music from her time period (she was born in 1983, so she would've been prime for 90's music, maybe the 80's carry-overs if she was staying current). She's even described by one or two of the people interviewed that she was deep down an old soul, or at least had the massive appreciation for where soul music and good R&B music came from. Indeed at one point one of her collaborators said she mused on making a ""Jazz/Soul supergroup"" that would've included a member of the Roots and Mos Def. It's sad so much of what she could've been didn't get realized and she died at 27, in large part due to media WAY-over scrutiny, and both too much and not enough attention from her family and friends.",/review/rw3355210/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. Some may know Amy Winehouse as the Grammy award winning singer, while others may know of her as the drug-addled target of the paparazzi who died from alcohol poisoning 4 years ago. Still others may be asking ""Amy who?"" Director Asif Kapadia (Senna, 2010) delivers a film that doesn't shy away from the brutally tough ""down"" times, but also shines a light on the ""up"" times for this suburban Northern London Jewish kid who was simply unable to manage her rare musical talent, profound personal weaknesses, and the relentless media pressure.",/review/rw3355210/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2015,clarkj-565-161336,7," Back to Black
","I saw this at the NXNE festival in Toronto last night. The movie was quite long, I must admit I was exhausted when I left. Not in a negative way, but overwhelmed at everything I had seen. The director had a lot of material to give us and he didn't hold back. The scene that I found the most powerful was the one in the recording studio with Tony Bennett, it was pure magic. I can't say that I followed Amy Winehouse, or was very familiar with her work, other than the song 'Rehab'. I did love her hairdo, it reminded me of the Ronettes. I am always fascinated by artists and how they develop.",/review/rw3355210/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2015,bryank-04844,9," 'Amy' Is a fantastic documentary about one of the Great Jazz Vocalists!
","Amy Winehouse might have been one of the best all time jazz singers in the world. In fact, I believe she still can hold that title, even almost five years after her death. Her voice was something unlike anyone ever heard and could be in the same league as Etta James, Billie Holiday, and Edith Piaf. In addition to her voice, she was charming, witty, and a ton of fun to be around. You just couldn't get enough of her likable personality. Unfortunately in 2011, Amy died of alcohol poisoning at the age of 27, making her one of the latest members of the '27 club', which Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Kurt Cobain, Jim Morrison, and Brian Jones all belong to.",/review/rw3355210/?ref_=tt_urv

9 July 2015,GavinHeisenberg,9," It's sad, depressing, interesting and very insightful
","""Amy"" The Amy Winehouse Documentary is brilliant. It's sad, depressing, interesting and very insightful. You feel like a fly on the wall as you watch raw video footage throughout that shows you that there were various factors that lead to her Drug addiction and untimely death. It shows you that she wasn't just a dumb junkie but from a young age she was a very mentally troubled person. She had a lack of discipline at a young age. Her Father neglected her as a child. But he had no problem using her as a meal ticket once she became famous. She had various mental issues such as depression and bulimia. Whilst I don't condone Drugs the doc does show you how and why people try and get hooked on them. The Doc is very fair in showing the good side and bad side of Amy. Ultimately it leaves it up to you to make your own judgement about her. My only gripe is that Amy's final Boyfriend Reg Traviss isn't in it at all. This is a huge omission considering he was with her until she died. Overall it is an amazing documentary that is thought provoking and will create a debate between people. RIP Amy 9/10",/review/rw3355210/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2015,Horst_In_Translation,6," What you could expect, decent summary of Winehouse's career and life
","If you have seen Asif Kapadia's Formula-1-themed ""Senna"", you basically know what to expect here. This one is a pretty decent film from start to finish, very much by the books, but also with a couple surprisingly great moments. This film here does consist almost exclusively of archive footage and that's fairly impressive as it runs for over 2 hours. We see concert recordings and many recordings as well from Winehouse's husband that he made of the two. He really does look like one of the main forces of Winehouse's downfall and her falling deeper and deeper in this spiral of drugs and alcohol. But there are more reasons, like her tough relationship with her dad or the fact that she could not deal with stardom. This is an argument you hear frequently, but it may be true in her case. There is a scene when we hear that she is sick of singing her old really successful hits, but her struggles kept her from achieving new hits, so she is forced to sing the old ones and it seems as if this really shook her to the core.",/review/rw3355210/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2016,SnoopyStyle,8," Trainwreck
","Amy Winehouse comes from a broken home. She would become a world famous singer. However, her many self-destructive problems would eventually overwhelm her and she would die at the age of 27. This documentary has many of her friends and supporters describing her rise and her deterioration. Her mother is weak and her estranged father is problematic. She suffered from bulimia, drug and alcohol abuse. I wasn't a big fan but like most people, I think her Rehab song is awesome. What I didn't realize is how personal her songwriting is. The best aspect of the movie is how the songs' lyrics are written out describing each one of her life's journey. It makes the Rehab utterly heartbreaking. The words ""if my daddy thinks I'm fine"" have a whole new meaning. Her dad is a real piece of work. This is a great documentary that is not simply for the fans.",/review/rw3355210/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2015,CleveMan66,6," ""Amy"" is a revealing and personal portrait of Amy Winehouse, but should have dug deeper.
","It's difficult to sum up a celebrity's entire life in a two-hour film, even if that person died at a young age. Placing that person's public moments in the proper context, showing some of the private moments to provide insight, revealing influences, hopes, fears and struggles to provide understanding and digging deep enough to suggest lessons the audience can learn from that celebrity's life – it's a lot to cover. Filmmakers have to decide what their focus should be, what to include, what to delve into, what to summarize and what to leave out. In addition, if the film is a documentary, they need adequate video and audio to tell the aspects of the story that they've chosen to tell. If they don't have video, they have a radio program and if they don't have audio, they have a book. It's all those challenges the makers of ""Amy"" (R, 2:08) had to confront. They did it fairly well on the surface, but could have dug deeper.",/review/rw3355210/?ref_=tt_urv

17 July 2015,malcp,7," Sympathetic but ultimately superficial portrait
","I hoped this would offer a more revealing insight into Amy's mental illness, but the problem with some types of mental illness is that people are so very good at hiding it. I guess what you do see here, in a way that for most people is hidden, is how much of your life for anyone with mental health issues is really just an act. For sure, thanks to her amazing talent, Amy's life was played out to a much wider audience and hence captured - often in excruciating detail by the camera, but by the end of the film, although I had a better idea of the chronology of events, I think it really exposed surprisingly little of Amy Winehouse and just what made her tick. Yes many people along the way did recognise her instability, but I think it was quite notable how the media seized on drug abuse, when this, bulimia and even the alcoholism that killed her were merely symptoms of much deeper problems. Inevitably, the roller-coaster of drug-abuse and recovery dominates the narrative of this film, but generally overlooks how much time and effort Amy must have spent on becoming the best Jazz singer on the planet and the amount of intellectual effort she required to achieve that feat and also to produce lyrics that were both sincere and interesting. I think she achieved that aim, but a 5 minute chat with her friend during the 2008 Grammy awards revealed just how superficial she found the achievement. Sadly despite her intelligence, she had a fairly closed mind to any form of psychological therapy, and despite a succession of boyfriends, doesn't appear from anything we see here to have found anyone who she trusted enough who was in any position to help her change direction. To my mind, she created a kind of comic book character for herself, only to find that despite massive international acclaim, it didn't mean the same thing to her. She gave a massive amount to charity, and clearly had a sincere perspective on a huge range of issues, sadly nobody in this film really talks to her about anything but ""Amy Winehouse"".",/review/rw3355210/?ref_=tt_urv

The documentary then swiftly goes on to 2001, when we see and hear Amy in a jazz band, and before we know it, we are already in 2003. Along the way we see Amy getting better at writing and singing, and at boozing too.
