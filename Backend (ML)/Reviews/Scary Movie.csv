9 January 2011,dfranzen70,6," Disjointed and generic, but it does have its moments
","So help me, I found Cop Out to be not completely bad. Yes, that's a backhanded compliment, but I assure you that it's completely deserved. Cop Out, from its inane title to its derivative plot, has no business being anything but a hokey hoedown of banal buddy cop dopey behavior. And yet's it's not as gut-wrenchingly awful as all that.",/review/rw2443380/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2011,Samiam3,5," Cheaply done buddy film
","Cop Out has a few laughs, but otherwise it's a surprisingly bland experience. It suffers from a generic storyline, questionable performances and the simple fact that almost none of the intended sources of humour achieve the desired effect.",/review/rw2443380/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2011,Rodrigo_Amaro,10," A funny homage to the action-humored films of the 1980's
","When did we become so uptight about comedies and about things that makes us laugh? When did we become so demanding about jokes and humor? It's a mystery to me that viewers didn't get a clue about what was so funny in ""Cop Out"", an homage to action-humored flicks of the 1980's but brought into a new decade. This film is light, well intentioned, hilariously funny and with good performances by the unusual team made by Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan.",/review/rw2443380/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2010,jwchoo1,7," Cop Out : BeatDown Reviews
","Do you want to know the reason why some people did not like this movie? I'll tell you why. They take this movie too seriously. I mean yeah there are some problems in the movie but then again, nothings perfect.I watched this film and within 10 mins into the movie, I was laughing my butt off. I believe that more people will enjoy this film if they just relax and unwind while watching this film, and to not take it so seriously.",/review/rw2443380/?ref_=tt_urv

12 July 2011,Chrysanthepop,," Crapped Out
","'Cop Out' is perhaps Kevin Smith's most 'un-Kevin Smith' film. It lacks the brand of humour his previous works had. Even though he has made his share of bad films next to a few great ones, the jokes usually work. In 'Cop Out' most of them fall flat. The story (if there is one) has no direction at all. The characters are annoying. Supporting characters appear and disappear randomly. In Smith's defence, he wasn't part of the writing department (though he was involved in the editing) and the script is just one big mess. I still wonder why he decided to make this? Even the actors seem to lack interest. Tracy Morgan is completely miscast and he has no chemistry with any of his costars. Actually none of the actors have chemistry. Bruce Willis too is unimpressive. Perhaps he's finally tired of playing the same kind of role over and over again. The title is somewhat right for the movie although I don't think it ever had potential.",/review/rw2443380/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2011,mattbaxter72,1," Is this a joke?
","This is supposed to be a comedy, allegedly. I only know that because it's advertised as a comedy, though - you certainly wouldn't know because of any funny moments in the film. It's a buddy cop movie, where Bruce Willis looks as though he's overdosed on Valium and Tracy Morgan makes up for that by doing what I can only describe as a minstrel show routine.",/review/rw2443380/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2010,claudio_carvalho,6," An Old Formula That Works
","After a clumsy operation trying to capture a drug dealer, the N.Y.P.D Detectives Jimmy Monroe (Bruce Willis) and Paul Hodges (Tracy Morgan) are suspended for one month by their Captain Romans (Sean Cullen). Jimmy decides to sell his rare baseball card to pay the expensive wedding of his daughter while his jealous partner believes that his wife is cheating him with their next-door neighbor. When Jimmy is selling his card to a memorabilia store, the place is stolen by two smalltime thieves and the detective loses his card. They track down the thieves and discover that he exchanged the card per drugs with the powerful drug lord Poh Boy (Guilermo Diaz). Jimmy and Paul seek out the gangster that proposes to trade the card per his car that had been carjacked. The detectives find the car but when they open the truck, they have a huge surprise.",/review/rw2443380/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2010,SloberDon,," mildly amusing but not very good
","I guess you could call a few scenes mildly amusing but this movie never delivered any laugh out loud moments. It certainly never rings true as an action film. I don't know if they were mocking or paying homage to movies like Lethal Weapon and that's precisely the problem. Bruce Willis was solid but Tracy Morgan was severely out of place. While I find Morgan funny, his act wears thin fast. Also, Kevin Smith experimenting with the hand-held shaky camera craze has to be considered a colossal failure. Maybe it wasn't even intentional but I had to look away from the screen on some simple shots because of the motion. What was he thinking? Doesn't anyone screen the final cut and let him know what was wrong?",/review/rw2443380/?ref_=tt_urv

","Saw this film as the first part of a double feature with the far more anticipated Shutter Island following, so my attention was only half there. That's about all the attention I needed, though, as it's a typical buddy cop movie through and through. Not that I expected anything different, mind you.",/review/rw2443380/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2010,frode-le,2," Just awful
","Movies in this genre usually do the trick for me. They are not meant to make a huge impact on you, just give you some good laughs for an hour and a half or so. This movie however, fails in every way possible. The plot is bad and not even remotely interesting. A valuable baseball card that Jimmy Monroe (Bruce Willis) is selling to pay for his daughters wedding, gets stolen from him, and he and his partner, Paul Hodges (Tracy Morgan), gets themselves into a big mess trying to get it back.",/review/rw2443380/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2010,brando647,5," The Title of the Movie Says It All
","Kevin Smith is one of my favorite modern filmmakers, but everyone makes mistakes and Smith's latest is COP OUT. I really wanted to enjoy this movie. Unfortunately, the movie was so mediocre that I found my attention wandering through most of it. The film, Smith's attempt at recreating the fun of 80's buddy cop films, stars Bruce Willis and Tracey Morgan as two disgraced cops who are suspended after a botched stake-out. The timing couldn't be worse, as Jimmy (Willis) is trying to pay for his daughter's wedding. He decides to sell off a rare baseball card to raise the funds, but a robbery relieves him of the card before he can. Jimmy and his long-time partner Paul (Morgan) set out to track down the baseball card and find themselves in the middle of a case to bring down a local drug lord who hopes to expand his business.",/review/rw2443380/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2010,the_Poppuns,10," Really really funny
","I don't know what everyone else is on, but this movie was one of the best comedies I've seen in years. It's a HOMage to 80s buddy cop movies. But this actually improves upon them, imo. It didn't have that serious section that those did. This was wall to wall laughs. It wasn't just me. Everyone in my theater was laughing beginning to end.",/review/rw2443380/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2010,tavm,3," Cop Out doesn't do Bruce Willis, Tracy Morgan, and director Kevin Smith much favors...
","This was another movie I decided to watch with my movie theatre working friend. With names like Bruce Willis, Tracy Morgan, and director Kevin Smith attached, Cop Out sounded like a can't miss comedy. Well, this was more of a hit-or-miss flick for me with the funniest lines concerning some sexual adultery as discussed between Morgan and Sean William Scott as an annoying thief arrested by cops Bruce and Tracy. I also liked when they mentioned ""Rabbit Season"" ""Duck Season"" as part of the argument. Morgan also had some good solo moments though I thought he was too over-the-top when he quoted all those movie lines in the beginning interrogation scene. So while the story was easy to follow, the cast and writers mostly seemed to strain for laughs, I mean, how can someone like Smith veteran Jason Lee appear for a cameo and not say anything even remotely funny? So yes, he was wasted and so mostly was Rashida Jones as Tracy's wife though there was one amusing scene of when she turns the tables on her husband. So on that note, Cop Out definitely lives up to its title...",/review/rw2443380/?ref_=tt_urv

",What can you expect in a Bruce Willis movie?? Action? Suspense? Thriller? Hadn't Cop Out been made you could never have said a comedy!

9 March 2010,Quinoa1984,4," like a cop, I'll say it: OK, move along, nothing (much) to see here
","Kevin Smith has, up until now, always made his films the way he wants to, written them all, and even if they all haven't been great successes (actually, the last decade has been downs more than ups, though usually still decent entertainment, i.e. Zack & Miri Make a Porno), they've had his stamp. But compared to the boring stiff of a movie called Cop Out, I'd take the sappy Jersey Girl any day. Say what you will, at least that film had an underlying wit about it that was striking, and some surprises (George Carlin, really good actor!) But this time, with Cop Out, he makes a nose dive into Hollywood self-satisfaction, with stars who are equally too self-satisfied with the material they're dealing with. It's beneath them all, and no matter how much Smith might say it's parody or what-have-you, it still is undercooked, boring and just shoddy writing. That he doesn't ""prove"" himself as a director/editor of something he hasn't written is another matter, albeit he could have left it at Reaper.",/review/rw2443380/?ref_=tt_urv

4 March 2010,gryffindor249,8," Who Needs Jay and Silent Bob?
","I have to echo another reviewer who stated, ""I have rarely seen such a stark disconnect between some scathing reviews and actual audience reaction."" I just saw this film because I really like Tracey Morgan, Bruce Willis and SWS and figured that for a $5 matinée it would be diverting. It was far, far more-easily one of the most entertaining movies I have seen this year. A great throwback to the 80's cop buddy comedies with great characters, humor and action. I wish Kevin Smith would do more projects like this...he really proved here that he is as gifted as a director as he is as a writer/ director (Mallrats excepted of course...) and it was really cool to see his style and flourishes on a project that did not take place in his Jersey Universe.",/review/rw2443380/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2011,kylehaines96,8," Funny but not one of Kevin Smiths' best
","I don't know why everybody dislikes this movie so much. One reason that i can only think of is that Tracy Morgan screams the entire time. I mean once in while it's funny. But not throughout the whole entire movie. Other than that the movie was entertaining and funny. The funniest part of the whole movie was at the beginning were Tracy Morgan is interrogating a witness. Tracy Morgan then says: ""YIPPIE KAY AY MOTHER (BLEEP)!"" Bruce Willis than says: ""I have never seen that movie before."" the movie is funny and has Bruce Willis shooting people so give a chance. because when you really watch more then once it really grows on you.",/review/rw2443380/?ref_=tt_urv
