29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Entertaining!
","Teen Wolf isn't the best supernatural show available but I have to admit that I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would and that's mainly because the cast is just about perfect. I'm a big fan of supernatural type movies and TV Shows so I thought I'd give this a chance and I'm glad I did because again, I really did enjoy it. I didn't watch it when it was originally on and started it during the pandemic. It was so good that I binged the entire series as fast as I could and it actually left me wanting more. Mostly because the ending was so bad but also because the show was that good. That's when great news dropped for fans of the show. They're making a movie that comes out in early 2023. I can't wait!",/review/rw3295557/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2020,Supermanfan-13,8," Better than I thought it would be (except the last season)!
","I can't believe how much I enjoyed Teen Wolf! I originally thought it was a going to be a show aimed at teens but boy was I wrong. I'm an adult male and I enjoyed it so much more than I thought I would. It's just like any other good Superhero show but instead of a Superhero, it's a werewolf...but the premise is pretty much the same. I binged the whole thing straight through over the past few months and the only thing I'm upset about is that I put it off for as long as I did! The only problem is the last season isn't very good at all but still doesn't take away from the fact that's it's a very good show!",/review/rw3295557/?ref_=tt_urv

19 November 2012,aslankan4,7," Another Surprisingly Addictive Series
","Don't judge this series from the title. Please simply don't. There are various potential open to further interpretation and this piece is fantastically fun! I think the producers should seriously think about updating the ""name"" though. Now Watch and Love!! ",/review/rw3295557/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2021,pawanpunjabithewriter,6," Magnificent First Two-and-a-half Seasons
","The first two seasons were amazing. Wonderful supernatural stuff with excellent story. Rest of the seasons are divided into two parts. The first half of season 3 was good although not as much as 1 & 2. The rest were so poor nothing happened made even a bit of sense. They went way too much with the supernatural thing. They brought in so much magical and unbelievably incredulous stuff nothing made sense, it felt like they just wanted to take the show ahead not caring much the way they are taking it. Banshee, Kitsune, Most of the new antagonists which I wouldn't like to name to spoil the things, were simply horrifically unreal, although werewolves aren't either but NONE OF THEM MADE SENSE. The moment Kira entered and the Japanese demons took over, nothing was as before. Should watch only first 2 seasons, rest you might like too, but wouldn't understand for sure.",/review/rw3295557/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2021,hnt_dnl,6," Good start, got tiring
","TEEN WOLF was a generally entertaining series for it's 6-season run during the 2010s. But the first 3 seasons are easily the best, with the last 3 seasons being a bunch of forgettable randomness. It really started off with a bang in Season 1, a perfect balance of comedy and horror with a strong cast of characters. The original Season 1 ""pack"" of Scott, Allison, Stiles, Lydia, and Jackson are really the best teen group of the series. Also, the supporting adult/parent/mentor/teacher characters of Derek, Melissa, Argent, Sheriff, Kate, Peter, and Coach were great, too.",/review/rw3295557/?ref_=tt_urv

21 June 2022,No-Life-101,7," Good show!
","As I watching (and rewatching) the show I did enjoy it, but I felt like some of the quality went down as the seasons went on. I didn't really enjoy season 5 or 6, but loved the beginning seasons so much. The characters are good and they get introduced well, but I felt like they could have done more with them at the same time.",/review/rw3295557/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2011,stacie-williams,8," Pleasantly Surprised
","Like another reviewer has stated, when I first saw the trailer for Teen Wolf, I was totally uninterested. The only reason I watched the first episode was because it came on directly after the MTV movie awards and there was nothing else on TV. I was actually surprised by how good it was. The acting was good, the special effects weren't too cheesy, and there is something dark and edgy about it. I admit some parts of the plot are predictable, but then again, there are some things that flat out surprised me. The actor who plays Stiles is fantastic, and I think he is a big part of why I like the show. Also, Derek Hale's character isn't too bad on the eyes, either. ",/review/rw3295557/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2022,bebotamer,9," !!!CONTAINS A BIG SPOILER!!!
","First of all I'm sorry if I'm not that fluent in English but,I enjoyed S1+S2+ First half of S3 soo much I think it's one of the best shows ever I have ever seen,but in the second half of S3 nothing made sense,they just defeated him by scott biting his arm that's all and then everything ended,I didn't like the end at all even tho the evil spirit was so strong even the Oni's didn't defeat it,the ONLY thing that made me can't complete tge series is!!!SPOILER ALERT AGAIN!!!is Allison's death,I mean she was one of the biggest character that made the series better and made me excited to watch it,I can't imagine completing Teen Wolf without her being there it would be so boring I don't know why did they just kill her.",/review/rw3295557/?ref_=tt_urv

25 March 2020,unrivaledraj,10," A really good show!!
","Such mediocre rating for a show this good is really surprising. There are a dozen other shows which are pretty average but have a better rating. Teen Wolf seriously deserves above 8 rating. To begin with, the story of each season is pretty good, non repetitive and isn't focused on just one single character. All the actors have done a decently good role, justified their characters. The music and background score and the songs in between are absolutely amazing.
Each season brings out something different and the characters keep growing, unlike other shows the characters here don't keep making the same mistake which looks ridiculous, but here the writers have worked upon this, there are no stupid cliched teenage drama, yes their is romance, but it's very believable and looks natural. Overall it's a pretty good TV show and worth binge watching. It seriously deserves a lot better rating, so it's a 10 from me.",/review/rw3295557/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2011,brandonm-9,9," NOT a Twilight copy, an interesting show
","So I heard about this show called Teen Wolf. My friends, both males and females, told me about it and said i should check it out. My first though was ""Oh geeze, not another cheesy, twilight tween flick.."" So I decided to check it out anyways. After watching it, I was quite surprised and much more impressed than what I expected it to be. This is NOTHING like twilight. Sure, it contains some of the clich√©s Twilight contains, but other than that there is no correlation and A LOT of television shows have clich√©s like the ones in this show. It also has an interesting story line that is actually pretty good. Although this show is actually quite good, it has its flaws. The acting at some times is forced, but for the most part it is good. The special effects are also lacking, but many good shows also lack this aspect and are still very successful (such as NCIS). I want to point out that I am in fact MALE and not female so this review is from the point of view of an average guy, not some girl who drools over these types of shows. In fact, this is actually one of the first that I am interested in. If this keeps up the pace and doesn't turn into a clich√©-fest, this show could be very successful. Although at the time I'm writing this there are only five episodes, it is nonetheless an interesting and thrilling show that everyone should check out.",/review/rw3295557/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2011,leslea_kate,7," lots of potential
","If you view this series as directly related to the 1985 movie, you WILL be disappointed. But if you view it as ""loosely inspired by"", and as a horror series where the drama is pretty significant, and the humour is more a side bit, and it's easy to see that this series has some impressive potential.",/review/rw3295557/?ref_=tt_urv

10 August 2018,divinejessy,10," My rainy day well spent
","OK first off I'm 36 and seen pretty much everything SciFi/Horror out there. Add to this I'm a fan of the original Teen Wolf (number 2 i mean what the hell was that) also watched the cartoon series which I enjoyed. Also I'm not a fan of much if anything this generation done by MTV.
I avoided this show even though a few people said i should give it go. So I decided to keep it for a rainy day. 
It started raining yesterday and I'm already on season 2!! 
Brilliant, solid acting , great effects and fantastic casting around. Season 1 has drawn me in for keeps. I was expecting cheesey teen angst type stuff but no. Its dark, moody with just then right amount of humour. I've got to give a massive round of applause to whoever is in charge of music as it is amazing. 
One more thing ... Massive kudos to the guy playing Stiles, he is excellent.
Seriously give this a go, you won't regret it. If you do blame me. I'll even give you my address so you can come round and kick my butt. Although you'll probably just want to pet my dog and admire my bottle cap collection.( I'm joking, I don't have a dog)",/review/rw3295557/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2014,nikowitak,10," Amazing Show!!! Dylan O' Brian!!!!
","All the actors grow as the show goes on, but Dylan O' Brian is the one with a definite career. After part B of season 3 the, Stiles is by far my favorite. He's so funny and Dylan O' Brian has shown a range. This show is only underrated because it's aired on MTV, but everyone should give it a chance. My second favorite TV show!!!! My number on being Breaking Bad! It's gotten so dark and suspenseful since season 1. I promise you will not be disappointed. It's super gory and has lot's of blood so gore fans this is a must watch. It's also very funny at times as well. I think the scariest thing on the whole entire show was Void Stiles, without spoiling too much. Thank god MTV put out something amazing!!!",/review/rw3295557/?ref_=tt_urv

27 September 2022,nikismaili-72230,10," Great 3rd season 3B
",I love this show especially season 3B with void stiles ducalion Theo Liam thiam styles Lydia stydia these are my favourite duos it's so sad that stiles isn't going to be on the movie hopefully he's gonna be in the movie anyway I'm in season 6 episode 18. I don't know why people won't rate it 10 out of 10 cmon man this deserves a 9.0 out of ten yeah it had some bad scenes but i was amazing and the villans I don't think any other tv show that had better villans and hotter characters for example Tyler Dylan like these to are the hottest characters In the whole entire show and movie but they should bring back stiles.,/review/rw3295557/?ref_=tt_urv

5 August 2015,Sourwolfnewtmas,9," So much better than expected
","My friend had been pestering me to watch this show for a year but I would always refuse. From the little I knew, I had only heard about there being wolves and an unnecessary amount of shirtlessness. Both of course are true but there is another element to the show that makes it different.",/review/rw3295557/?ref_=tt_urv
