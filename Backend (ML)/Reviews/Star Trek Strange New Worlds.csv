7 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,9," Liked it much more than I expected
","Star Trek: Strange New Worlds was so much better than I expected. This is the prequel to the original Star Trek and even has some familiar characters like Spock and Uhura. It's led by Captain Pike (Anson Mount) and has basically the same plot as the original in where they explore the galaxy. This is actually one of the most well received Star Trek shows ever by both the critics and fans, it currently has a 99% on Rotten Tomatoes. It has a new fresh feel while also honoring the original. This is a show that both new fans and longtime fans can both enjoy. This hooked me from the very first episode and didn't let go. I binged the entire first season over a weekend and I'm already looking forward for next season.",/review/rw8287260/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2022,bosporan,8," To boldly go ...
","Strange New Worlds is a fabulous Trekverse series in contrast to some recent offerings. Vintage stylistic choices from uniforms, through technology to sounds, together with opening credits and episodic stories make this a joy to watch for lovers of original Trek.",/review/rw8287260/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,8," Entertaining!
","I just finished watching Star Trek: Strange New Worlds and have to say I really enjoyed it. I don't consider myself a huge Treky or anything, I watched the original a little but it was on before I was born and watched Next Generation when I was a little kid but don't remember too much, I do like the recent movies a lot though. Anyway, just as a sci-fi fan with a little knowledge on Star Trek...I liked it. It seems that even most die hard Star Trek fans like this one and they hate all the new stuff. The writing and cast are what makes this so good and the visuals are also pretty good for a tv show. I'd definitely recommend this to both Star Trek fans and sci-fi fans who don't know anything about Star Trek and are just looking for a good sci-fi show to have fun watching.",/review/rw8287260/?ref_=tt_urv

6 May 2022,drael64,8," Feels like Trek
","I've only seen the first episode, but I can say with certainty, this is the first time I've been optimistic about nu Trek.",/review/rw8287260/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,kyotoguardian,10," Everything it should be
","Finally. Star Trek finds its soul again. Great episodic stories, modernised but true to its source. Interesting characters, with both entertaining and engaging exploration. My only small complaint is that the intro music doesn't have the same pull as the earlier series but there's no such thing as perfect. Overall, the creators have managed to balance the old with the new, and the result is both visually and emotionally stimulating. In my humble opinion, it has refreshed the Star Trek timeline and given hope that more will be possible. Strange New World's has become a firm favourite. Keep it coming!!",/review/rw8287260/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2022,Turanic,8," Third time is a charm?
","It seems like the authors are trying to go the classic Trek route this time after 2 recent attempts, finally... It's ironic when Orville looks more like Star Trek and Star trek grabs some ideas from Orville, but it somewhat works in the end... The story is finally cantered around captain whose acting was the best thing in entire ST:Discovery, the crew is varied, you even get a sexy nurse , so you have a somewhat healthy balance of traditional and woke Trek in the end... The first episode was enjoyable and I hope there will be many others, I hope they go multiple episodic stories route this time rather than long story arc, but so far I am somewhat mildly impressed as a fan of TNG, DS9 primarily...",/review/rw8287260/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2023,a-gordon-2374,8," It's the best Trek since Voyager, even if the cast is weak
","Some of the abysmally low reviews for this really show how certain Trek fans will never be satisfied with any new Trek series. As if every Trek series, including TNG, didn't have issues.",/review/rw8287260/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2022,nincubura,10," ST:NBT -- Next Best Thing
","This is BY FAR the best realization of ST:TOS -- The Original Series. It was a self contained mission. It delivered a morality message. It addressed issues of psychology and emotional intelligence. It worked to connect various timelines. It did not take itself too seriously, at the right times.",/review/rw8287260/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2022,faithless4734,9," Refreshing
","2 episodes in and I am impressed. So far this is a great show with a great cast of people. I have enjoyed the episodes I have watched to date and I predict that I will continue to enjoy this show. It is great to see this science fiction classic being treated the way it deserves respecting the attributes that made it great instead of trying to change it into something ""better"" and in the process ruining the whole reason it was great.",/review/rw8287260/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2022,msghall,9," ""Cool!"" Finally, a return to the legacy Star Trek universe
","After the rather drab, talky and alienating Alex Kurtzman soap operas of Picard and Discovery, Strange New Worlds returns us to the Roddenberry version of the show (ST, ST:NG, ST:Voyager, movies). Once again, we can imagine ourselves on the bridge, empathize with real characters and most of all, enjoy tightly-written scripts that don't insult the audience with dull backstory or gratuitous dialog.",/review/rw8287260/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2023,oliverschindler,10," Best Star Trek so far
","Love the TNG, found original charming. But this is my favourite. The design is great - not TNG but not old either. The moral dilemmas of the original and almost as good as a cast as TNG. And pike is amazing",/review/rw8287260/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2022,ruidanielbarrossss,8," Alex Kurtzman finally boldly goes were Rick Berman has gone before. And thats great.
","First episode, and we have an encapsulated story, with a beginning, middle and end, in which the dilemmas of modern society are explored in a self-reflective way, using an alien civilization as a parable.",/review/rw8287260/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,AlexKrenshaw,8," Finally a decent series on a trajectory to match The Next Generation
","In terms of when this is set, it's important to remember it's just before the original series with Kirk and way before The Next Generation. You need to take this into account when evaluating, looking at what the mission is, looking at the sets, costumes and all round character of the show.",/review/rw8287260/?ref_=tt_urv

6 May 2022,tom992,9," It's about time...They got it right
","After 5 years they've finally got it right, star trek the way it should be. I now serial is the way modern show are these days but star trek has it's sharm when it's episodic. Every week a new adventure.",/review/rw8287260/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2022,thelastinlineloves,8," This is Star Trek
","The first episode itself felt like worthing an entire season of some of the series I've seen recently for how good it is, I found my self asking if I was watching a movie or a tv series. After many disappointments finally a job well done, good stories, full of meaning but without rhetoric, beautiful sets, beautiful costumes. In the first episode there were more aliens than in the entire first season of Andor, to name but one, and they were all beautiful to look at. We are now on the sixth episode and so far after the conclusion, my partner and I are repeating 'wonderful'! I am sure it will maintain this level every episode. Yes, this series is TREK!",/review/rw8287260/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2022,mattsmith-21755,8," Oh WOW
","Strange new Worlds is the first Star Trek I've watched since Voyager. I only wanted to give a look when I gained access via a streaming service. I enjoyed the first episode and it didn't take me long to work out when this was set. I knew nothing about the show beforehand which made this more exciting. The format is completely different, smooth and decently paced. Great Characters played by actors I'm not familiar with. I enjoyed the first season and I'm looking forward to the next season.",/review/rw8287260/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2022,Arcadia1701,9," FINALLY Star Trek is back!

1 January 2023,sassershawn,10," S1:E1
","Its funny how the idea of star trek gets into your core. It would be a way cool world we live on if we knew that there are so many places we could call home. It would blow my mind to feel like going to the moon or mars like ni big deal, like flying to Paris from the USA. Its just the journey that make us better and more capable. When I watch this episode, I feel the moment when he says ""possibilities"". Wow, we are strong and capable now, its just greed and stupidity that keeps us in a box that never existed. Im better than that and I know its just a matter of time. Either we make the right decision to climb above our prejudices and sheer stupidity, or we destroy ourselves till we do! Thank you for reminding what the meaning is behind, that will just not do! I will do better and I as a 3D printer will explore the possibilities of the impossible. I pray someday is tomorrow and we are smart enough to jump and reach the other side of possibility.",/review/rw8287260/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2022,markvanwasbeek,10," Finally the Trek we like
","I grew up as a little kid with TNG, and it cerrainly spiked my inrerest for sci-fi ever since. I liked the endless possibilities and story lines, they were well thought out and done. Ever since Voyager, Star Trek was lacking something. Wasn't much of a fan of Enterprise, although that was quite Trek too. Discovery and Picard are okay, but the story line is just blah. This goes back to the 90's Trek, exploring strange new worlds indeed. The production value is epic for a Star Trek show, the cgi is pretty neat. Actors are spot on, and I like the new Spock. The wokeness is not overly in your face like the previous shows. This is just oldschool Trek, and I hope this one runs as long as TNG!",/review/rw8287260/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2022,creole-12539,8," This is Star Trek
",It's a great throwback to TOS. The characters we know joined by characters who's history we never got to see on air. The easter eggs are plenty with only 1 I didnt really like. The sets of course look way beyond TOS which is unavoidable but they do a good job in general of recreating the feel of TOS. I enjoyed the premiere and look forward to the series.,/review/rw8287260/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2022,batmanforever-93249,10," This is a great Star Trek series.
","I quite liked the first episode, i like the intro, the music is almost as good as Prodigy's theme, but not as good because the repetitive part (the one which can be learned by the fans) is missing but is still great, the visuals are fantastic, the acting is great, only Khan's relative belongs to 2022's omnipresent kringe era. This is probably one of the best, Star Trek productions of the present and it is what Discovery should have been from the start.",/review/rw8287260/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2022,luisq05,9," Real Star Trek spirit at last
","Great show, feels like real Star Trek, unlike Picard and Discovery. I got few nitpicks to complain about the show, that don't really matter much, like the security chief being a woman at the same time it's shown that her job is a very physical one and genetic manipulation is not allowed. I simply find hard to believe that in the human elite there's a woman in such a psysical job without genetic manipulation. If he was from another species or was genetic manipulated like other woman from the show it would be more understandable, but with human genetic rules, I'm sorry, men are stronger, faster and everything in that field :-/",/review/rw8287260/?ref_=tt_urv
