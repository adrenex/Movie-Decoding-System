6 October 2019,Darkside-Reviewer,5," Tim Curry in a clown costume is more terrifying than any CGI monster
",I personally didn't enjoy IT 2017 so I didn't have much hope for part 2 but I was expecting them to at least tone down the CGI instead they went overkill with it no imagination used here just in your face flashy CGI effects that look fake and plastic the only thing frightening about this movie is that sadly because it made money at the box office more Stephen King books are going to get remakes and it won't be long before we get an all CGI Maximum Overdrive movie remake.,/review/rw5109804/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2019,gcarpiceci,1," Thus movie is a disgrace...
","...it is a disgrace because it is a gross betrayal of the original book. IT - the book - is a psychological thriller about friendship, about relationships, it is about the deep fears we have as kids and which grow with us until we are adults; it is about how we learn fighting and ultimately defeating these fears.
IT - the movie, this movie - is a cheap zombie movie stuffed with special effects and CGI with the sole purpose of jump-scaring the audience. There is no narrative, no storytelling, nothing more than a random - and awfully long - sequence of third league horror vignettes.
Shame on this movie!",/review/rw5109804/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2019,Fat_cats_stack_cash,5," Call me ""old fashioned,"" but CGI monster overkill does nothing for me
","I really, realllly wanted to like this film. As a huge fan of the original mini-series (and EVERYTHING Tim Curry), I knew I'd have a challenge going into both Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 with an open mind. I had to separate. I didn't have as high of expectations as I did for Chapter 1 as Part 2 of the mini series was much weaker than the Part 1 anyway as well as Stephen King's It (Book).",/review/rw5109804/?ref_=tt_urv

4 September 2019,jtindahouse,8," Not your average horror movie
","Very early on in 'It Chapter Two' there is some wink wink dialogue about an author writing a great book, but messing up the ending. Anyone who is familiar with the 'It' book or original mini-series will know the ending was not well liked. Here now though they had a chance to rectify things, and I can assure you they did. Not just in terms of the ending, but the entire second entry is actually a fantastically made film and in my opinion superior to part one.",/review/rw5109804/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was originally hesitant to see director Andy Muschietti's rendition of Stephen King's beloved book ""It"" back in 2017, but after hearing splendid reviews from fans and critics; I took a chance and came out pleasantly surprised. Since then, I agree with why that is now considered by many to be a modern Horror classic.",/review/rw5109804/?ref_=tt_urv

5 December 2019,TheLittleSongbird,7," Doesn't float quite as brilliantly
","Stephen King's novel is a masterpiece, didn't properly appreciate it on first read but with King's style being much more familiar to me (whereas it was a bit of a shock at first) it still stands as a genuinely scary, nostalgic, at times very funny and very powerful book and one of his best. The 1990 mini-series is an uneven one, with a great first half and disappointing second half with the ending and IT's true form having notoriously poor reputations for good reasons. Absolutely loved the first 'IT' film from 2017 and consider it better than the mini-series personally.",/review/rw5109804/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2019,raquel_pompey,5," I really wanted to love IT!!!!
","Okay so saw the first remake of the movie, was absolutely in love. I went and saw the second one today and didn't feel any where near close to what I felt for the first one. It was super long but that isn't even what upset me. It was just lacking in delivery! Pennywise was hardly in the movie. He was in it but they spent so much time soul searching the past of the characters that the real present stuff went lacking. Needless to say the first remake is an all time favorite. This one, I definitely should've waited until it came out on DVD. Just being honest. The first one was way to good for this to be part 2. It didn't deliver the expectation that the first one set.",/review/rw5109804/?ref_=tt_urv

15 September 2019,hunter-friesen,6," ""It Chapter Two"": Too Long for Too Little
","In 1913, Henry Ford introduced the assembly line to the Ford Motor Company. He made a ton of money and was hailed as a leading innovator. Now just a hundred years later, director Andy Musciehtti brings that same assembly line principle to It Chapter Two as he serves up his scary products in the exact fashion as the one before.",/review/rw5109804/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,Leofwine_draca,4," Crushed
","I approached IT: CHAPTER TWO (2019) with some trepidation having heard of its poor reputation beforehand, and it turns out every bit of criticism was totally justified. Whereas the first chapter was a solid and enjoyable 8/10 for me, this sequel misses the mark in every respect and feels like it was made by a totally different team who had no idea what they were doing. It's a dragged-out, silly, and ultimately padded follow-up story that has no need to be three hours long; I thought it would just tell the adult story but it turns out we keep getting unnecessary flashbacks to the kid stuff too, which slows things down no end; as far as I'm concerned the kid story was done and dusted by the end of the first film.",/review/rw5109804/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2019,eelen-seth,8," A frightening yet touching story of forgotten friendship and lost opportunities.
","The sequel to the 2017 box office success 'It' starts exactly where it left off. Almost no explanatory flashbacks to the situations the Losers Club got themselves into, fighting the terrifying Pennywise. Only difference in 'It Chapter Two' - they're all grown up and ready to end It, once and for all.",/review/rw5109804/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2019,hiraishinnojutsu,9," 9/10, if you consider this as not a horror but a fantasy movie
","The Guys (and girl) back at it again! After 27 years had passed, the evil entity that is a metaphor for humanities' fears and negative emotions/thoughts/feelings is back to haunt them again by utilizing chilling illusions backed by great VFX to remind them of their childhood pains and fears. Great storytelling, as each of the protagonists experience the return of the demon by their own unique way, where each is pushed emotionally to the brink of madness, but at the same time, helps them to find and gain strength to unite and move forward in order to kick the devil's clown ass back to oblivion, but this time, it'll be once and for all (without another 27, 54, 81, or 108 years of waiting to return). I love the added childhood flashbacks which, to me, give the first movie more color than it does to the last one while also giving us one important message: not all frightening childhood is bad in the long run as it can also bind people together with unbreakable bonds even after separated for nearly 3 decades, and a little loss of memory of a particular event and place. There is one more important message in the final moments of the film which I'm not gonna mention here, I urge you to go watch it by yourself because the ending is very beautiful, comparable to the last year's 'Blade Runner 2049'. Don't listen to the critic too much for you will find it's beauty that they will never discover.",/review/rw5109804/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2020,leonblackwood,4," Preferred the first movie! 4/10
","Review:
Well, that's 3 hours of my life that I won't be getting back! I was really disappointed with this film because the plot is all over the place, and the whole back and forth in time thing, made the movie drag. The horrific Pennywise scenes were a bit random, and I didn't feel the chemistry between the characters like I did in the first film. On the plus side, there are some ""jump out of your seat"" moments, which were pretty scary, but you don't get to appreciate the attention to detail because it's mostly shot with a dark palette. I did enjoy the first movie, which is why I was so disappointed with this sequel, and I personally don't know why it's nearly 3 hours long. Anyway, in 2016 Derry, Maine, Don Hagarty witnesses his boyfriend Adrian Mellon being murdered by Pennywise after a gang of homophobic teenagers beat them up and throw Adrian off a bridge while leaving the annual Derry carnival. Overhearing a police scanner, Mike Hanlon (Isiah Mustafa) discovers It has returned and calls his childhood friends, Bill (James McAvoy), Eddie (James Ransone), Richie (Bill Hader), Ben (Jay Ryan), Stanley (Andy Bean), and Beverly (Jessica Chastain), back to Derry to honour the promise they made in 1989, to kill It if it came back. While the others travel to Derry with only hazy memories and a sense of dread, Stan slashes his wrists in the bathtub soon after getting the call. The Losers meet for dinner at a Chinese restaurant, where Mike refreshes their memories, while they are tormented by hallucinations and learn of Stan's death. Richie and Eddie decide to leave until Beverly reveals that ever since she was exposed to Its Deadlights, she has been experiencing visions of their deaths should they fail to leave town without fulfilling their promise. Mike takes Bill to his library abode and shows him, via a drug-induced vision, that they can stop It for good. After the others agree to perform the ritual, Mike explains that the ritual requires seven personal items from there past to be sacrificed. Henry Bowers, who survived being pushed into the well at the Neibolt house and was arrested for murdering his father in 1989, escapes from a mental institution with help from It. Meanwhile, in the Losers old clubhouse, Mike advises the others to find their artefacts by retracing their steps following their falling out after first entering the Neibolt house. Beverly finds Ben's love letter at her old home, still believing Bill wrote it and encounters It posing as Mrs. Kersh. Ben recalls his childhood encounter with It at high school before realising his artefact is the yearbook page Beverly signed which he kept in his wallet. Both Richie and Eddie recall their own personal encounters with It while retrieving their artefacts, a game token from an abandoned arcade, and an inhaler. Pennywise taunts Richie about his sexuality, leading to him deciding to leave again and reconsidering again after recalling Stan's bar mitzvah, before menacing Eddie in the guise of the Leper, but flees when Eddie standing up to It causes the being to shrink in size. Bill finds his childhood bicycle and recovers the paper boat from the storm drain where Georgie was killed. The group descends into a cavern beneath the sewers, and they perform the ritual in the remains of the meteor that brought It to Earth ages ago. The ritual appears to work in trapping the Deadlights in the sealing jar, but they escape after It emerges from the jar in a giant spider-like form. Will the Losers finally kill It with there new ammunition? You have to watch the 3-hour epic movie to find out! Although they used established actors in this movie, and they gave each of the characters some depth, I didn't feel the emotion that I did in the first film. Also, the storyline didn't seem to flow properly because it looked like various sketches pieced together. In terms of a horror film, it didn't have the same shock value as the first film, and for a movie in this genre with a 15 rating, I don't know what type of audience this was made for. With that aside, it still made a profit so I wouldn't be surprised to see a third movie in this franchise. Disappointing!",/review/rw5109804/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2019,Darthfrodo58,2," Much longer than Chapter One but half the enjoyment
","After seeing Chapter One I expected so much more, unfortunately IT didn't deliver. The film starts out with an overly graphic bashing scene that tries hard to be topical but instead seems to be there just to dare you to criticize it's honesty. And things just go downhill from there. The Loser's Club of the first film reunites 27 years later to have another go at defeating Pennywise, but where the kids were charming and you wanted to root for them, the adults all go separate ways to have their own jump scene moments through an overly long two hour middle section of the film. The film bogs because it keeps showing flashbacks to when they were kids instead of building the characters as adults. The effect is that you never really care about them as adults, they're just an excuse to show CGI monsters that never really scare you on any level. The pacing of the film is so roughshod that it never lets any suspense build as it jumps from one scene to the next, while you keep checking your watch wondering how much more of this you'll have to endure. The middle becomes a bit of a horror film mish mash with an homage to John Carpenter's The Thing (verbatim quote and all) a little bit of Toy Story erector spider, a dash of Poltergeist's Native American mumbo jumbo added in with a couple of million years old space entity tossed in in case you needed something to understand what they're up against. James McAvoy's character is jokingly referred to as an author whose book endings suck (a nod to the book) and unfortunately this film doesn't improve on the novel. It's just an overly long series of vignettes that tie to Chapter One in an unsatisfying way.",/review/rw5109804/?ref_=tt_urv

29 February 2020,liderc,1," So bad it's funny...
","Already after the first scene, the only truly apalling scene in the movie, I wanted to switch It off. And I should have. The pointless but sadistically detailed depiction of a hate crime, which also looks and feels like directly lifted from the 80s or 90s (the root of the conflict, the hairstyles, the clothing, the queeny, weak gay men vs the tough, braindead hetero men stereotypes), doesn't make any sense at all. It might actually be the rebirth of It, as it feeds on the evil in the small backwater town, but the uninformed viewer never gets much of a chance to understand that. But as the script generally is full of holes, meaningless hints or pointless ""horror"", this is simply what you get. The only thing really made clear is that men are only allowed two things: die or mope around as depressed losers, dreaming of romantic relationships which will never happen.",/review/rw5109804/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2019,Fella_shibby,8," As a fan of the book n the original mini series n aft having enjoyed the remake chapter 1, i found this to b a well concluded chapter.
","I saw this film with my family in a theatre.
This film has amazing cinematography, direction n acting. The only thing missing is the camaraderie of the child actors but we do have some flashbacks.
Some scenes r very scary, especially the small girl, the mirror one n the Pennnywise's daughter one.
This film has lots of jump scares too.
