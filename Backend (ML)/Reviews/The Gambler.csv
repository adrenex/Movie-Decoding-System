19 November 2003,Poseidon-3,," Perfectly tolerable...even enjoyable!
","No one in today's Hollywood is going to truly outshine past pairings such as Clark Gable and Joan Crawford, Cary Grant and Grace Kelly or even Rock Hudson and Doris Day.  They simply had too much mystique and showbiz magic behind them for the tabloid-ridden stars of today to compete with.  However, based on what's out there today, Clooney and Jones make a delicious, gorgeous pair.  In this frothy, sometimes manic production, Clooney stars as an ace divorce attorney.  So successful is he that he can turn around even the most airtight cases.  Yet he has it all and is bored.  After he pulls the rug out from under one of his clients' wives (Jones), she sets out to exact revenge upon him.  The two play a cat and mouse game of I-got-you and you-got-me, with their actual feelings occasionally rising to the surface. Clooney is charm epitomized.  His jaw-dropping good looks are actually beginning to show minor signs of wear (check out his cheek pores in that opening teeth cleaning sequence and note the onset of wrinkles and rasp in the voice -- though he still looks like a god in kind lighting), but thankfully, he's become such a decent actor that he should have no problem continuing a strong career.  In this, he is comparable to Cary Grant, who remained attractive right up until his death.  Unfortunately, he doesn't have QUITE the skill that Grant had, but he'll do.  (Some of the lingo and jargon that Clooney has to emit looks and sounds like it's over his head.) Jones is astonishing.  She has, without question, that old time glamour and the finely honed talent to carry her roles.  Her face, clothes, hair...everything is stunning.  Together, the two are blisteringly attractive and charismatic.  The supporting cast is great here with Rush (in a surprisingly tiny role) hamming it up well and Thornton presenting another one of his oddball characterizations.  Also of note are Cedric the Entertainer who is less annoying than expected and especially Adelstein as Clooney's adoring, sentimental cohort.  (And it's fun to see Duffy get a big screen role which beautifully utilizes her brittle, nose-in-the-air persona.)  One of the funniest and most shocking moments in the film comes courtesy of Keyes who plays an asthmatic hit man.  The whole film is peppered with odd little characterizations, some funny, some intriguing, some just bizarre.  (The diner waitress is hysterical.  The hunky pool man is perfect.  Clooney's boss is unintelligible and just plain weird.)  The film seems to take place in it's own little world, which can sometimes be quite different from the one the rest of the audience lives in.  The quirkiness and farcical nature of the film occasionally threaten to cross it over into Zucker brothers territory, but ultimately it keeps it's feet on the ground.  A couple of familiar or dull moments can't dampen the spirit of the whole.  The stars are deliriously attractive, the story has a few surprises along the way and the film is very easy on the eyes and often entertaining to the ear.  There's also a delightful title sequence inspired by vintage Valentine cards.",/review/rw0523626/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2003,bob the moo,," Far from their best work with a few weak spots but still an enjoyable farce
","Miles Massey is an amazing divorce lawyer who has a well-earned reputation. When he takes on the case of Rex Rexroth, who was caught on video cheating with another woman, he successfully wins the case and leaves the wronged wife, Marylin, with nothing. However he also falls for her, but she is planning his downfall in return for her losing everything she had.",/review/rw0523626/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2005,Galina_movie_fan,7," Quite Tolerable After the Second Viewing:
","I saw it recently for the second time, and even though the huge holes in the plot are still there, I liked it much more than the first time. Thinking of the holes, Coens are very talented artists - perhaps we, the audiences are supposed to be smarter than Miles Massey (George Clooney - perfectly cast) - the very successful, always victorious divorce attorney for the rich and famous? Massey is the author of unbreakable ""Massey's Pre - Nup"" but he is so bored and restless than maybe he is waiting for someone who would be able to break it? Enters cool and sensual Marylin Rexroth (who looks exactly like Catherine Zeta-Jones), the woman who is after ""wealth, independence, and freedom"" and who ""eats the men like Massey for breakfast"" with the glass of French red wine Château Margot, 1954. Thus starts the game of wills, wits and desires with twists in every turn. Some of them are surprising and clever, some - predictable. ""Intolerable Cruelty"" may not be the best Coens' film but it is enjoyable, stylish, and funny. At least two scenes closer to the end of the movie are absolutely hilarious.",/review/rw0523626/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2003,Buddy-51,," uneven film with a most beautiful lady
","I doubt that there are two more strikingly attractive actors in movies today than George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Zeta-Jones, in particular, has the kind of classic beauty that puts her right up there with the great screen legends of all time, women like Ingrid Bergman, Natalie Wood and Audrey Hepburn, who, with their ravishing good looks and photogenic quality, came to define the ideal of female pulchritude in their time.",/review/rw0523626/?ref_=tt_urv

3 December 2020,morrison-dylan-fan,8," ""Now I'm going to have it (his head) stuffed, mounted, and have my lady friends come over and throw darts at it.""
","When I would heard about the film years ago,I for some reason kept confusing it for Burn After Reading (2008-also reviewed.) Recently starting to watch more credits from the Coen's,I was pleased to see this title appear on Netflix UK, leading to me discovering some cruel intentions.",/review/rw0523626/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2020,joeytosi,7," This movie is for fans of screwball comedies of 40's & 50's.

24 August 2006,Isaac5855,8," One of Clooney's Best Performances
","A surprisingly smart comedy from Joel and Ethan Cohen, INTOLERABLE CRUELTY is a deft and entertaining comedy about the relationship that develops between a fast talking attorney (George Clooney) and a man-eating gold digger (Catherine Zeta-Jones)who pretty much eats husbands for lunch. This delightful throwback to the Tracy-Hepburn, Grant-Russell comedies of the 30's and 40's moves at a nice pace and is anchored by a razor sharp performance by Clooney, who has rarely been more appealing on screen. Clooney does everything right here and his performance alone makes this film worth seeing, but Zeta-Jones never allows herself to be overshadowed by him in one of her more venomous characterizations. Worthwhile bits are also contributed by Geoffrey Rush, Billy Bob Thornton, Richard Jenkins, and Edward Herrmann. One of the most underrated comedies ever made which is a definite must-see for Clooney fans.",/review/rw0523626/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2009,TheLittleSongbird,8," Very enjoyable, a few flaws, but I really liked it!
","This was much better than I thought it would be. This is a more than decent film. Yes it is flawed, but very few movies I have seen are completely flawless. What sparkled most was the chemistry of George Clooney and Catherine Zeta Jones. Clooney proves himself very likable, and does actually have some comedic talent. I can understand completely why people are entranced by Zeta Jones, because she looked amazing in this movie, and her rather saucy style of acting is put to good use in this film. There was very good support from Geoffrey Rush and Edward Hermann, as well as Billy Bob Thornton in a minor role. The script is very funny and sharply-observed. But the problem I had with the movie was the story. It was very confusing at times, and there were some scenes that felt misplaced like the opening scene. The film is also beautifully filmed, and carefully timed. In conclusion, an enjoyable film, and I am glad the film has a decent rating. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",/review/rw0523626/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2004,warnerclassic,," Not intolerable, but
","George Clooney stars as a self-loving whiter than white toothed lawyer who is becoming bored with his never-ending success. A challenge comes in the shapely form of Marilyn Rexroth (Catherine Zeta Jones) who wants to marry (or preferably divorce) her way to riches. With Clooney hired to represent her soon to be ex husband, he inevitably falls for the gold diggers charms.",/review/rw0523626/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2005,PersianPlaya408,8," A decent comedy from Coen brothers with good cast and writing
","I don't see why many hated this movie. I thought the Coen Brothers look at divorce court lawyers' lives in this comedy with a twist was actually pretty interesting. Thte script was first-rate, they sure can write, the direction was interesting for the most part, although film did lose intensity at parts. I thought the acting was great, especially George Clooney who i liked a lot in the lead, he was perfectly casted for this role. Zeta Jones was decent, she pulled off her role, although she still isn't a first-rate actress in my eyes. I thought Rush and Billy Bob Thornton were great in their supporting roles. Cedric the entertainer was wasted here. The film was decent, some good acting, script, decent direction, and nice atmosphere. 8/10",/review/rw0523626/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2007,planktonrules,8," A somewhat conventional but extremely enjoyable Coen Brothers film
","Okay, compared to the average film this certainly is NOT conventional. But compared to many of the wilder and weirder Coen Brothers films (such as THE HUDSUCKER PROXY or RAISING ARIZONA), this movie is more ""normal"" than most of their films. However, while having a fun but almost conventional plot is NOT a bad thing for lovers of the weird Coen touch because interspersed throughout the film are some of the oddest and funniest supporting characters that make it obvious to most in the audience that this is one of their films. In some ways, this is reminiscent (on a less subtle level) of Fellini--who is known for some of the weirdest and ugliest supporting characters in many of his films.",/review/rw0523626/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2005,BrandtSponseller,6," Maybe I'm just not in the target audience for this one
","Miles Massey (George Clooney) is a divorce attorney whose clientele consists primarily of the rich and powerful in the Los Angeles area. He's well known for an ""ironclad"" prenuptial agreement named after him and also known for taking his clients' spouses to the cleaners. But when he works his magic against Marilyn Rexroth (Catherine Zeta-Jones), he may have picked on the wrong person.",/review/rw0523626/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2004,FilmSnobby,8," Back to form.
","I had been slightly disappointed with the Coens'  previous  *The Man Who Wasn't There* -- it was, in my judgment, their first non-masterpiece since their apprentice-work  *Blood Simple*.  While all their films are self-consciously derivative, *Wasn't There*  was derivative without the wit (though brilliantly filmed and acted regardless).",/review/rw0523626/?ref_=tt_urv

9 March 2004,superultraman,," Good movie - lackluster reviews
","I am amazed at the lack of true movie knowledge that is displayed in these boards sometimes.  If I had to guess at the age of the writers of bad reviews this particular movie has garnered in the reviews preceding mine, I would say at best 18.  Not a single one of these unknowing boobs remembers Cary Grant, nor the fast-talking zany comedies like Bringing up Baby, and again nor the romance comedies of Hepburn & Tracy.

2 January 2005,departed07,10," The Coen Brothers have done it again!
","Joel and Ethan Coen are known for making odd-quirky movies that often have a motive or lesson behind it. ""Fargo"" dealt with organized crime, ""The Big Lebowski"" dealt with how an unemployed bum doesn't have to deal with the world, ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" showed how a low educated individual can change an industry; now in ""Intolerable Cruelty"" the Coens show audiences how love is some what odd.",/review/rw0523626/?ref_=tt_urv

29 February 2008,moonspinner55,5," Coen Brothers comedy: would-be rude and brazen...
","Director Joel Coen and his writing and producing brother Ethan have an affection for the past which they manage to translate well to their projects. For their lighter fare, they may take the '30s screwball romps with Jean Harlow or Clark Gable and use them as a helpful outline--a starting point for the comedy--and then cast accordingly. However, with ""Intolerable Cruelty"", which was worked on by three other writers besides the Coens, a rude, snorting tone was called for which the Coens shy away from. Beautiful divorcée/gold-digger Catherine Zeta-Jones appears to have cleaned up financially from her last marriage and accepts a new proposal from cocky, smitten divorce lawyer George Clooney; he insists on a prenuptial agreement to protect her money, yet she wants to romantically wipe the slate clean...but can he trust her? The satirical jabs at modern marriages (via Beverly Hills) are excruciatingly stupid (particularly the opening with Geoffrey Rush), though an early courtroom sequence with Clooney grilling Jonathan Hadary's effete Baron is joyfully played to the hilt. The Coens' don't have the nasty streak required for spiteful, ""War of the Roses""-styled farce--they're too fanciful, and too entrenched in old-fashioned repartee. The resulting film doesn't have the sharp edge or bite the secondary writers were probably going for, and eventually it all collapses like a harmless soufflé. ** from ****",/review/rw0523626/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2004,jotix100,8," L.A. L.A. Land
","Joel Coen's latest attempts at comedy have not been too exciting. I watched this film in DVD format since the original release didn't last too long and when I tried to see it, it had departed from the local screens. It was a shame because any Coen picture is worth seeing. ",/review/rw0523626/?ref_=tt_urv

11 October 2003,Quinoa1984,7," The weakest of the Coen brothers' films I've seen, though it's not all on their end to blame
","Intolerable Cruelty was a film that didn't originate with the Coen brothers. Unlike such masterpieces as Blood Simple and Fargo, and even theatrical sleepers like The Man Who Wasn't There and The Big Lebowski, this was a film in all likely-hood offered to them from producer Brian Grazer and from a story by Matthew Stone and Robert Ramsey (of EdTV fame if you're wondering who they are).  Indeed, this is the first time a Coen brothers film (with a possible exception being O Brother Where Art Thou, which also starred George Clooney) looks 'big' bucks.  ",/review/rw0523626/?ref_=tt_urv
