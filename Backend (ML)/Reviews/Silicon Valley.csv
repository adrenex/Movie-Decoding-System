12 August 2022,siderite,5," Boring film misusing cast
","If you expected Gina Carano or Matthias Hues to kick ass or Nick Searcy to act, you will be sorely disappointed. Instead you will get Carano as a mother of two sitting in a lone house waiting for her husband when a band of sadistic ex soldiers come and attempt to capture her. I don't know how military service was back then, but five armed men should have done the job in five minutes. Instead, they try to wiggle themselves into the house, trick the woman, wait her out, convince her, etc.",/review/rw8247046/?ref_=tt_urv

","Lemme just say, I love that Daily Wire is getting into entertainment. I've been a subscriber for over a year, and I'm not leaving any time soon. However, this movie is not good.",/review/rw8247046/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2022,jerrycoliver,4," Swing and a miss
","This was...very slow. Very very slow. Even by 1970's western standards, it's slow. It seems to be the trend now for westerns to move at a snail's pace. If you compare it to ""The Power of the Dog"", they're about even though this movie has some action sequences, they both dwell on things a lot longer than they should. In ""The Power of the Dog"" they tried to be profound, and though they didn't achieve that goal, this movie wasn't even trying to be profound.",/review/rw8247046/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2022,lehman-94-760319,2," A Daily wire, Cowboy Cerrone, Gina Carano Western
","What could go wrong?? Movie is about 107 minutes and not one punch or kick are thrown by either Cowboy or Gina. Also there is basically a complete lack of any story. Did anyone whoever shot a gun oversee this movie? A shotgun does not miss everything from 15 feet. I would give it a 1 but that is reserved for movies that are somehow worse. There is absolutely no redeeming value to this film and anyone who gave it a higher score is insane. It's a waste of any amount of time but luckily I skipped ahead 15 seconds at a time just to see if any fighting would happen. I mean what's the point of casting these two if they aren't going to throw down? The Daily Wire isn't going to add any subs with quality like this. You have $, spend it properly and do better.",/review/rw8247046/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,notemanmusic,4," Could have been so much better
","I love westerns and wanted to love this one but, like the previous film Shut In, there are just far too many stupid choices and, in this case, bad shots, So many bullets fired, so few targets hit. Frustrating.",/review/rw8247046/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,andy-564-367996,5," I wanted to like this
",I cant stand movies where things just don't make sense. When plot armor is used then common sense isn't used. Frustrating when things happen that just dont make sense. All signs of a poor director cant tell a story. Gina (and i like her) didnt put in the best performance. Just because I'm rooting for these daily wire movies doesnt mean we shouldn't hold them to a decent standard. Ive never seen so many bad shots or decisions not to shoot when anyone would shoot just because of plot.,/review/rw8247046/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2022,jselden-01484,2," I Love the Daily Wire and I Hate This
","The entire plot turning moment where Haddie decides to pull a gun on her GUESTS who hadn't shown any inclination towards violence, was absurd. I shut it off right after that. It is a major problem. The film would have been so much better if the villains were actually PROPER villains and ended up attacking her and her family. Because then, we would actually hate the villains and be rooting for her. Instead, Haddie is essentially the villain of the story! I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here! She put her entire family in mortal danger over what exactly? Because she saw scalps? But with the information that they were bought from traders, she had no idea whether or not the men in the house were killers. They didn't do anything wrong! LOL. WOW! It's laughably bad. Additionally, by stealing their weapons, she gave them almost no choice but to attack the home to retrieve them. If someone stole my dead father's guns, I would do anything to get them back. Every step she made was unwise and foolish. I felt no empathy for her at all. What a shame. This is bad writing.",/review/rw8247046/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2023,haddixboi,1," Redundant and Poor Quality
","If you want to be bored by this pitiful excuse for a movie then you will for sure love ""Terror on the Prairie."" This movie is devoid of anything that makes modern cinema any bit interesting. Horrible casting, dull and tired acting, and worst of all it isn't even a good western movie. I wouldn't even consider this a western movie because its so bad that i started watching Star Trek because it felt more like a western movie than this sorry excuse for a movie. Do not watch this movie if you value your money and sanity. To the studio and directors of this movie. Quit. If you want to be bored to death then go ahead and watch this movie, an alternative that is more exhilarating is watching oil paint dry.",/review/rw8247046/?ref_=tt_urv

","First off, I'm a big Gina fan and I wish her all the best of luck and hopefully she'll have better opportunities in the future. That being said, I think a lot of people these days evaluate things base on politics and that is really sad.",/review/rw8247046/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2022,trinaboice,3," Why would conservative The Daily Wire think their audience would enjoy this bloodbath?
","IN A NUTSHELL:
When Gina Carano was kicked off the set of the Star Wars Mandalorian and blacklisted in Hollywood for Tweeting a political comment that Disney declared was ""abhorrent"", the crew from The Daily Wire jumped into action and secured a movie script for her within days. A lot of liberal film critics have refused to even watch or review this movie simply because it's co-produced by Gina Carano and distributed by the conservative The Daily Wire.",/review/rw8247046/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,luptoneous,1," I've seen this before, just not this bad
","This is a terrible movie, one that drags along very slowly, one that just doesn't work. The characters are not relatable and often make odd decisions that no one in their right mind would make. The plot is tied and worn out, one that we've seen a bunch of times already. This movie is almost like someone really, really, really wanted to make a blockbuster but tried too hard and failed. Carano's acting, if you want to call it that, was amateurish, at best. The antagonists were nothing short of clownish, getting in the way of themselves in their feeble attempt to do what they had come to do. If you want to see a movie really bad, then this is a really bad movie. Don't waste your time on this.",/review/rw8247046/?ref_=tt_urv

4 August 2022,WermhatsWormHat,4," Yup its bad even if you want to like it
","What were they thinking? I like Gina Carano but why is she cast in this role? Why was this movie so dull and generic? It seems like most reviewers here like the Daily Wire and wanted to like the movie like myself, but the honesty and reason that comes with being a Daily Wire fan and truth teller means its impossible for anyone to give this a good review even as fans going in. If you saw the trailer and thought ""Huh? Gina Carano? In this? Looks pretty lame..."" then you've seen the whole movie. I like most of the other Daily Wire movies a lot, what a disappointment.",/review/rw8247046/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,gypsy-87293,1," What a joke
","Carano and Searcy put up about the worst performances I've ever seen. He used to be a decent actor, perhaps he had a stroke or just forgot how to act. She was in Deadpool and had virtually no lines and still did better in that. Her scenes were painful to watch, and her inability to connect to the audience is why this film has such terrible reviews. I really don't understand why this film was even made, perhaps trying to play off the Yellowstone hype. I'd say this is a B movie, but that would be an insult to B movies that are at least moderately entertaining. I really cannot imagine any of these ten star reviewers actually watching this drivel. Do not waste your time on this flop. And for the love of God, someone tell Carano and Searcy to retire from acting already.",/review/rw8247046/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,3," Wut in tarnation? Chewin gravel onto tumbleweed rolling in molasses is more exiting than this lick and a promise bag of nails prairie coal.
","Probably the worst Western I've seen in my life, and I'm retired. Has writer Josiah Nelson ever even seen a Western? The Three Stooges would've made better outlaws. The entire show-down shoot-out was utter nonsense to the point of cringeworthy. Everyone was shooting when they weren't supposed to, and not shooting when they should've been. And for being in any sort of army/war ranks, these bozos had zero tactical skills. As if four Wanted Gangsters couldn't surround and take over a house with only a woman and child guarding it - within minutes, let alone days. And I'm not sure what was worse, casting an annoying constantly crying baby, or Nick Searcy as the Captain with his constant lame biblical quotes. The writing was the biggest joke, a bad joke, that dragged on and on for almost 2 hours, of which felt over 3 hours long with the ridiculously long dragged out scenes and snail-pacing. It was convoluted, bland, lacked continuity, riddled with plot and technical issues, and had zero logic to it; why would Gina Carano's character all of a sudden pull out only a double-barreled shotgun on four heavily armed men, with a baby and her son in the home? They were almost done eating... let them leave, then barricade yourself without them knowing you're onto them and gain the upper hand - instead of risking a gunfight from the get-go when you're outnumbered and have a baby and young boy within arms reach. Complete nonsense. A fifth-grader could've written a more convincing screenplay.",/review/rw8247046/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2022,imseeg,4," The title is laughable and so is this movie. Mediocre. At best...

18 June 2022,radhrh,4," Back to the 1970s
","There's something very 1970s about life in 2022. Rampant inflation, an energy crisis, unions threatening strikes and possibly nuclear war. I'm half expecting Slade to reform! There was also a move towards hyper realism in western movies after the romantic notion of the wild west in 1950s westerns. Terror on the Prairie has a feel of those movies, life is grim and hard on the frontier. It's also kinda boring and I'm sorry to say the pacing of this movie was too slow, IMO. There's also a lot of dialogue considering there isn't much of a plot; a family living a hard and monotonous life on the prairie get attacked by a gang of outlaws. That's it, that's your plot for you. There's a lot of violence and while I love violent movies when they're done right, like a Quentin Tarantino movie for example, I thought the violence was overdone. There's also the Gena Carano problem, she can't act worth a damn and certainly can't carry a whole movie. The rest of the cast are new to me.",/review/rw8247046/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,benjaminskylerhill,7," Solid direction, but the writing is a mixed bag.
","From the opening scene, I was surprised at how well-directed this film is. Both dramatic and action-heavy scenes are well-framed and the actions and reactions of the characters are always the focus of the visual storytelling. It makes for an exciting watch!",/review/rw8247046/?ref_=tt_urv
