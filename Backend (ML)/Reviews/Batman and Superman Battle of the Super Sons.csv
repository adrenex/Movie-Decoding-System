","All those mister cranky-pants who gave this a weak rating really should stop and consider where this fits into the history of DC Animation. First, the retro design and colors are consistent with the short homage/montage at the begging. To those of us who remember where and when this all started, that was telling. And welcome. The script is sharp enough to withstand de-construction in film class, it establishes characters, sets a story arc, and builds nicely. There is a lot of humor and whimsy here too. An extra bonus is the development of the two boys against the backstories of their parents. It works well. Overall, one of the enjoyable animated features in years.

20 October 2022,LeAvantGuardian,8," Really Satisfying with good character writing
","From pretty much start to finish this movie was a lot of fun. The animation quality is fantastic. I really enjoyed the relationship between Johnathan and Damien. I felt the writing was very true to the characters, and really well written. Voice acting was good. Action was great. Really no complaints. DC animation does it again. If only the live action, DC movies could compare with the animated ones. This one is well worth watching.",/review/rw8632734/?ref_=tt_urv

24 October 2022,blackeyce,8," Another great animated DC movie
",Batman & Superman Battle of the Super Sons was a great movie. They took a gamble with that art style and I think it really paid off. The story was well written and light hearted. It can easily become a comfort movie for many. Johnathon Kent was probably my favorite character in the movie. I think having Starro be the antagonist was a smart choice and I like the spin they did on his design he looked pretty creepy and I loved that. I also enjoyed seeing all the other heroes. Hopefully DC continues putting out animated movies with different art styles because I enjoy seeing how different these characters can be designed by different artist. As someone who loves animation this movie felt like something I would wake up to watch on a Saturday morning when I was 10. Well done.,/review/rw8632734/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2022,supersonss,10," Nailed on the head
","I am a huge dc fan but went into this with an open mind, that the movie might actually suck. However, I loved every minute. Everything from top to bottom was done very well. The cgi (Warner Brothers first ever all cgi movie) was done well and made the movie pop. The voices and acting we done, the relationship with the two boys was spot on with the comics and very entertaining. In my opinion it is a very compelling duo to watch. The story was a little straight forward but it works for this movie because there is a lot going on with the introduction of Johnathan to dcu there is a lot of back story and relationship development. It's a must see!",/review/rw8632734/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,akshaypatil-92684,8," That's what a movie should look like !
","Super amazing script and what a good writing ! After a super flop animation of Catwoman, DC is back with a bang ! This movie is absolutely amazing all with characters, script, story writing, animation and even in the sound ! Amazon movie , a must watch for superman and Batman fans out there ! Will definitely recommend one to watch this ! If felt great to see justice league all in action, not all characters were there but they managed to show some ! Teen titans refrence was good ! Hope this will lead to Teen Titan movie ! Great work by DC ! Hope to see more movies like this in future. Just don't ruin movies like Catwoman by animation !",/review/rw8632734/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2022,Drawmort,7," DC Animated Movies are my equivalent to comics. Very entertaining movie.
","I've probably said this before, but I've always thought that if WB didn't make things so complicated, they would make all of their Live Action movies based on their animated line. DC animated movies are great!",/review/rw8632734/?ref_=tt_urv

22 October 2022,kirkberg,10," Great movie... very impressed!
","I am kind of new to the DC animated movies, yet have become a fan quickly, and watching more and more. This movie was right away a favorite, kept my interest from beginning to end. The storyline, development of new character relationships, and dialogue was never dull or, ""slowed down,"" rather made me want to learn more and hopefully will with more movies in the future. The action scenes included were not atypical, seemed new and the right amount of drama and humor brought everything together that makes a movie one to watch again and again. The voice acting matched the characters spot-on, and I hope to see more movies in the same type of CGI animation.",/review/rw8632734/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2022,frzhvgvxc,10," Bring back what once was theirs
","Okay this movie has literally cured my life in October, I strongly suggest everyone who suffers from their high-stress life watch it ASAP. To speak out neutrally I might not give it a full credit rating due to the level of animation making, which I do think Warner Bro and DC could have invested more to promote. However, the plots are actually amazing and surprising enough to compensate its lacking in 3D skills. Everyone who reads DC comics might know Jon Kent has been aged up by a clearly wrong decision, making him lose his childhood and period of adolescence but become a immature adult to take a huge responsibility that shouldn't have been his. In this movie with Damian Wayne, he finally regain a chance to be a normal but special kid to experience and explore his own life with his best friend ever in lifetime, instead of being a tool or used symbol for LGBTQ by a straight male writer in comic book. He's merely a ten-year-old boy exploring his super-hero life with his friend and family, which is soooo valuable for me to see. Anyway, I do hope DC at least can have a sequel to this or they should try to fix up the pain that the terrible adult-Jon thing has brought to us fans:) Just bring back what was once the kiddos'",/review/rw8632734/?ref_=tt_urv

6 November 2022,alexandermarchack,7," Highly enjoyable! Execeeded expectations
","Very cool! Going in super fresh, I didn't know about the super sons at all. I really loved their interactions (Damien and Jon) and it really pushes the movie forward. Already seen many movies with Batman and Superman, so it's a fresh change. It is also very funny at times, but nothing super forced.",/review/rw8632734/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,implaxis,9," Excellent presentation!
","Wow, nice to know that DC can still make some good movies, even if just the animated ones. Battle of the Super Sons ranks as one of the top 5 best DC presentations I've ever seen. Great animation, music, and storyline! Sometimes funny, sometimes horrifying, all done well. Lots of background trivia for longtime fans as well.",/review/rw8632734/?ref_=tt_urv

","Worth the watch Which famous nice just for fathers a sons but also for mothers and daughters family & friends. Me and my family sit downtown for the Pham from start to finish and gave us the live action pack family bonding the hidden messages in encouraging messages as an animated film a cartoon movie has some call it it's worth the watch, it's worth the time. Also refills give us a good love the inside of the justice league the watch tower the kids farm did Batcave I'll get to see a different side of Damian in the back also Jonathan and Clark/superman's relationship gives off a animated version of Lois and Clark and I can't wait to see Damien in the dark Knight come to the big screen.",/review/rw8632734/?ref_=tt_urv

","Had me hooked from start to finish. Great job on the VA, the score and I even liked the animation too. Perfect pacing. Great and diverse set of characters. The synergy between Supes and Bats and then consequentially the two protagonists is great. The choice of villain was pretty exciting as well.",/review/rw8632734/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2022,JJSM22,7," A Friendship favourite in the DC comes to the screen
","I have always been a fan of the Super Sons since their first team up. Not so much for the adventures although those are pretty cool, it's the dynamic between Damian and Jon that gets me every time. They start off with a an antagonist tension between them that evolves through a love hate relationship into this brotherhood. Jon is able to get Damian to open up in a way no one has before and Damian pushes Jon to be his best, albeit a little roughly. This relationship has been incredibly adapted to the screen and makes you appreciate ever moment of it.",/review/rw8632734/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2023,EdwardtheBlackPrince,6," Jr Worlds Finest
","When Jonathan Kent's powers all of a sudden kick in his father take him to go see Batman and his Son Damian to get a diagnosis. However, after Superman saves the Watchtower from falling out of Orbit the other night and Green Arrow fails to report in. The World's finest go up to investigate and falls victim to the influence of Starro the Conqueror, Now Jon and Damian have to save their fathers and the world. While the plot itself does seem rather far fetch for these characters. It is the Super-sons against a justice league villain. The movie is overall entertaining. It does do a good of setting up the relationship between Batman and Superman and their kids. However this is the Sons story and overall I enjoyed the chemistry between the two of them Jons is more of a dork like his father and Damian's a complete jerk, but you can't help to love him. Damian's hands down the funniest in the movie, showing u to the fortress of solitude the first time Jons speaks to his grandfather explaining his lineage, and Damian is like yeah no ain't got time for that. Although Jon does seem to have a bit more focus than Damian .heir developed enough that both have a character. It a fun movie overall and good for some laughs.",/review/rw8632734/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,agof,3," inanimation
","I expected this to be an introduction of Superboy and Robin into the tomorrowverse. But no, this is a stand-alone CGI cell-shaded cartoon. The art-style is not the end of the world, the kiddy story is tolerable, even the action cinematography is not unwatchable. But the animation is atrocious. It's all jerky and choppy. 100 years of progress and this is what we came to. Plague, war, pixelart and faux-PS1 games, and movies with sub-300 FPS framerate. I said that garbage Spiderverse will destroy the industry faster than all the CGI weeaboo trash running at 5 FPS, and it did.",/review/rw8632734/?ref_=tt_urv

","The title alone for this 2022 DC animated movie was cringeworthy enough, but still I opted to sit down and watch ""Batman and Superman: Battle of the Super Sons"", despite the fact of not being overly keen on superhero-based movies.

16 December 2022,Milk_Tray_Guy,6," It's okay
","Damian and Jonathan meet and join forces for the first time to stop Starro taking over the Earth's population (including Batman, Superman, the rest of the Justice League, and the Titans). Jack Dylan Grazer's Jonathan, Jack Griffo's Damian, and Troy Baker's Batman are fine, but Travis Willingham's Superman sounds off. Laura Bailey is a good Lois Lane, and Darin De Paul makes a good Lex Luthor. The plot's not complicated (my first sentence here literally sums up the whole thing) but this is as much about character-bonding as it is about story. Adult character designs are not great, looking slightly deformed at times (even allowing for comic book proportions), and the animation has way too much obvious CG, to the point where watching the characters run is like watching a video game. The tone veers weirdly between buddy comedy one minute, and downright horror with the parasite infections the next. But there are some genuinely funny lines in the interactions between Damian and Jonathan. And we get Bat-Cow. It's not something I'd ever buy, but it's okay. 6/10.",/review/rw8632734/?ref_=tt_urv
