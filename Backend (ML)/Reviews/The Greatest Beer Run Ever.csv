20 September 2022,hafaball-1,4," Disappointing start
","After just seeing the Pilot episode, it was hard to have hopes for the future of this remake, but again, it was only 1 episode. Even so, very sorely lacking was any kind of hook for me to come back. The stale robotic Sorkin-esque dialogue didn't help, unnecessarily over-explaining how all this sci-fi mumbo jumbo time traveling works.",/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv

21 September 2022,adammarcotte,5," not horrible but a hard sell.
",Loved Sam and Al! The original is always hard to beat. Not sure the new guy can pull it off. I like the nostalgic feel but it's gonna be a rocky road. I think a lot of people are going to be critical and rightfully so. I'll give it a few more episodes to make a full judgement. The Quantum Leap idea is so cool so I want them to succeed. I think if they can bring Sam back in some way to properly pass the torch it may have a shot. Reminds me of MacGyver; so hard to live up to original. There has to be some good ideas ahead with the new characters so why not give them a chance to prove themselves? I wish them good luck but it's gonna need to make some huge leaps to successful.,/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2022,dream_collector,9," I was really surprised!
","Honestly, I was skeptical of this show at first. I figured remakes are usually lackluster, so I'd be wasting my time if I watched. Also, I never found the original to be all that interesting. In the new version, it's 30 years later after Dr. Sam Beckett entered the Quantum Leap accelerator and disappeared. The new team picks up the project where it left off to decipher the mysteries behind the machine and its creator. I'm not even a fan of science fiction and I enjoyed this! Pretty solid acting. Loved the diversity of the cast. I did take off 1 star for the lack of realism when it came to the characters' wardrobe and hairstyles. For example, in the pilot episode, Dr. Ben Song (Raymond Lee) goes to a fancy party in the 1980s, but all of the people look like they're in 2022! Nonetheless, I now look forward to Monday nights because of this show. I really hope it doesn't lose its amazing quality!",/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2022,micheleaz-62843,8," Seem to be in the minority- but I like it
","I like it. I was a huge fan of the original series and I think this series has huge potential. I think why most people dislike this is the new Sam is nothing like the old one. I am willing to give this new show benefit of the doubt for now. I hope it lives up. They better have a great explanation of why he rewrote Ziggy's code without anyone knowing and crashed the system. The whole season is hinged on that. If that reason does not live up, I fear this new show will be doomed. As far as the acting the new Sam is pretty good. I like that character. The new Al needs to step it up a bit. That character seems a bit flat.",/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2022,webcruser,6," (Ziggy glitches and coughs)
","Sam Beckett, Al Calavicci, and technically Ziggy, an artificial intelligence accessed by a glitchy gizmo that seemed to cough whenever Al slapped it. Those were the only characters present for every episode of ""Quantum Leap"" from 1989 - 1993. The rapport between the two leads and a variety of sympathetic stories broached many serious subjects with a light touch, making this one of my favorite shows of all time.",/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,maikerus,8," I want to know where it goes
",It's a continuation of the original series - 30 years later - which brings with it all sorts of interesting and fun possibilities.,/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2022,ninjaphil,8," Good next chapter in the Quantum Leap Saga
","I loved the original show growing up and am so glad they decided to continue the story rather than just remake it, although some 1 star reviewers on here are calling it a remake which makes me wonder what they actually watched...",/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2022,josh03081985,10," Pleasantly Surprised
","I went into watching the new Quantum Leap with a very biased opinion based upon the fact that the original was one of my favorite shows as a kid...after watching the premier however, I'm very impressed. They kept the spirit of the original intact while updating it for a modern audience. The pilot starts out as a slow burn but definitely gets better, and it has multiple nods to its predecessor. Now I will say this, I can already tell that it won't be everyone's cup of tea. But I do suggest if you were a fan of the original, give this one a chance. Don't base your entire opinion on the pilot episode...",/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2022,pkq-1,8," I'm a fan
",Surprised that there are a rash of negative reviews on this show. Perhaps I loved the original.so much that I am being less critical.,/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,mnstonecold,6," intriguing start
","I thought the beginning premise is different. Being a remake/reboot it will be different. Look at the many remakes that have been made-The Conners, Hawaii 5-0, MacGyver, Magnum PI to name a few. Some are good, but they are not the original. I saw some people not liking the special effects, but it is closer to the first season of the original until they ramped it up. I think there is potential as bringing back mentions and the character of Magic. I like that Don Bellisario and Debroah Pratt are involved to help to make it right. Only time will tell as it goes on. The nice hints and homages were nice that I caught on to. Any beloved show when it is remade people are going to be apprehensive. Are there things I don't agree with-yes. But I can look past those like any shows that reboot or reimagine. I think it will also get the nostalgia crowd like the original did. I lived through the times we have so far in previews. In all I give it a 6/10. I hope this lasts, as the world needs a hero like Ben.",/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2022,Greg-Tufaro,10," Can't wait to see where this goes!
","Think the show has a ton of potential. As a long time fan of the original (my favorite show of all time), this delivered the connection to the original that I was looking for and set up a bunch of new mysteries. It definitely feels like there is some network intervention going on behind the scenes which is likely causing a bit of confusion for the viewers... network execs, leave this one alone because you're ideas will likely kill it before it can build a fanbase! There did seem to be multiple teams of writers working on this first episode... the A story on Ben/Addison was well written... the B story about the actual leapee was a bit TOO MUCH. Did we really need to having a completely unrelatable diamond heist story featuring a girl who needed an operation? TOO MUCrH GOING ON. And the C story of the Quantum Leap staff was fine, but... their chemistry needs more development for us to care about them as individuals. I think the Executive Story Editor needs to pay more attention to how all of these parts are gelling together. You guys can do it!",/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv

","A commodity tv show, with a science fiction component really always needs two things to make up for the lack of drama, production, writing, and special effects.",/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2023,marysocontrary,," Diet Quantum Leap - same premise, but no heart
",I watched the first two episodes (the second one only because Beth Calavicci was in it) and to say I'm underwhelmed by it is an understatement and I think I understand why Scott Bakula doesn't want anything to do with it.,/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2022,pjdickinson-27822,2," It's just not good
","Raymond Lee and Ernie Hudson are good but everyone else is pretty bad. Mason Alexander Park is only in this to alienate viewers and his presence just gets more annoying as the weeks pass. It's not his ""look at me"" gender identity that's annoying - we're all used to that now but the fact he's just annoying and only there to make a point that isn't remotely worth making. From a technical standpoint the show looks a cheapo production filmed on a backlot because it's mostly a cheapo production filmed on a backlot. It has a 70s vibe without the ambition 70s shows had. The secondary plot is incredibly frustrating because it's never going to get resolved because there's no way a show this bad is not going to get canceled. It's just not good and, quite frankly, I've no idea why NBC put up the cash to get it made. The worst shows on CW could give this a run for its money. Hopeless, brainless and just plain I don't care.",/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv

21 September 2022,collectorofsorts,4," Very Disappointing!
",I'm a big fan of the original series. I watched it when it was fresh and new and waited with anticipation for each weekly episode. And I got all excited when I heard there was going to be a reboot. But this was ridiculous!,/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2022,CriticsVoiceVideo,1," Absolutely not.
","I know it's only one episode but I can already tell this isn't going to work. No warmth, no soul, no intelligence, bad writing, stiff dry acting, unlikeable characters, no mystery and intrigue.",/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2022,kevinokys,3," What am insult to the original
","Not sure if the writers just assumed the audience was dumber than the original or just really bad writing. In the original, we learn a little more about Sam each episode. In this, they tell us everything there is to know about Ben. They do not let the audience learn with the character which is part of what made the original so great.",/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv

20 September 2022,stuwright05,4," corny describes it well
","This just seems like it was rushed to me, I was a fan of the original, hard to believe its 30 years since it started, this new version, doesnt seem like they made an effort with it. I recognise some of the actors, but it just seems corny as someone else said.",/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,SkyFish-3,2," Quantum Crap
",NBC manages to take one of the best premises in TV history and ruin it. I knew they ruined it as soon as I saw the trailer. Then I saw the first episode and realized just how badly they mucked it up.,/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2022,dreamingwolf-01253,7," I thought it wasn't bad
",People are already crucifixion the show based on one episode. First of people keep using the term remake. This is not a remake. It's a continuation from the original show based 30 years later. One reviewer said that we got to learn a little about Scott's character in each episode with the original but in this one we learned everything in the first episode. I don't know what they watched but I don't know crap about Ben except he rewrote the code and has a fiance and is a physicist. People being to cynical based off of 44 minute first episode. I thought the story was good considering it's only been 1 episode so far.,/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2022,HardLight,3," Raise your hand if you're tired of remakes of classic TV
","Because I am. Desperately so in fact, the level of remake fever that seems to be in all of Hollywood these days is ridiculous, from movies to TV shows, we're seeing revivals, remakes and re-imaginings and all of them have suffered with a problem that has rarely been spoken of in favour of the more fun tearing into the remake.",/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2022,quockquock,1," I didn't care for it
","The show is trying, but it's nothing like the original They spend way too much time in the lab at QL headquarters, and not enough time cover the leap itself. It's pretty bad when one character in the lab makes you want to turn off the show completely. They are trying to build up this cast and make them have their own show and agenda, instead of focusing on the leap character himself. I wish I could leap back to 8pm last night and NOT watch the episode I saw. Are we to believe Dr. Song can hang out in a space shuttle bathroom for hours without anyone questioning his whereabouts. Silly premise to fathom.",/review/rw8571779/?ref_=tt_urv
