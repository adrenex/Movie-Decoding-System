17 February 2021,Ed-Shullivan,9," Dwayne Johnson tells his own life story as only the Rock can
",I previously read some of Dwayne Johnson's Life story and this TV series is allowing him to re-tell his childhood and his rise to stardom as an athlete and movie star bar none from his early wins and losses with his own words.,/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2021,ben-mckimm,3," Let's be honest
","Everyone is so in love with The Rock, that this could be just him on the toilet for 25 mins, every episode and everyone would think it was the greatest thing ever made. If you're giving this a 10/10, you're wrong. I'm sorry but 10/10 is perfect. Do you really think this show is perfect? You love The Rock. That's fine. You're allowed to love him but this is not a good show.",/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2021,grlym-46849,3," Tv show that holds into name recognition
","This show is terrible. If it did not have the The Rock attached to it, it would have never aired.",/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2021,Ashitaka137,8," OK i'm all in üëçüèæ
","This looks like it's going to be a fun feel good ride into the Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's history. Kinda reminds me of ""Everybody Hates Chris"".",/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2021,Tak005,3," Lacks clever wit.
","Unfortunately, I can say nothing more than the comedy is obvious and lacks clever wit and writing.",/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2022,shefchenko,1," Exactly what we needed
","Another one with this great actor, who can...act like himself, and like ... himself, and (hmm...what am I forgetting here...oh, right!) act like himself. Let's do a series for him! Ffs.",/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2021,gareth-75442,2," ""the rock"" overload, unfunny & mostly pretty uninteresting
","I get the fascination with ""the rock"", slap his face or name on a twig & it'll probably sell but this ""young Rock"" is a snorefest & completely unfunny & apart from the ""cameos"" of Pro wrestlers it's boring & totally uninteresting, a far better idea would've been "" Young Kevin"" a comedic look at Kevin Harts childhood.
The new sitcom ""Young Rock"" features a fictionalized version of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's life, so there you go fan boys n gals ""the rock"" is a product, made up & as false as his acting talent,merely a ""gimmick"" for dunderheads to idolise & worship like Mickey Mouse or the so called ""American dream"".",/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2021,Xavier_Stone,1," I'm shocked at how awful this is. The Rock's cooking is burnt and he's shilling it
","Created and produced by Jeff Chiang and Nahnatchka Khan, most notably known for producing...well nothing actually. The haven't made a hit yet, several lame attempts and this is another swing and a miss.",/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2021,MoistMovies,1," He's no president camacho
",I would support this show if we all got gatorade drinking fountains. But its even more self indulgent than Prez Camacho trying to grow crops with gatorade.,/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2021,stevebondi,5," Barely laughed even once :-(
","I love The Rock, but this show is not funny or very interesting.",/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2021,thatsgottahurt-1,1," Pandering Nonsense.
","Allegedly the ""true"" story of Dwayne Johnson. It's a very ""edited"" and embellished telling of this story. I'm particularly looking forward to an account of PED use and the resulting surgery to remove the nipple swelling etc. I wonder when they'll get to that.",/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2021,Darwinskid,," I like The Rock but...
","...This feels like one giant ego stroke. Not to say the program is bad per se but a lot of it feels like a generic product that's sole purpose is to promote its star and raise more awareness of its network instead of something from the heart. Some of the casting choices work pretty well others not so much, the tone keeps shifting from light comedy to light drama. Maybe I am being too picky because its just an observation from the first episode, but so far I am not impressed and I say this as someone who loves pro wrestling and been a fan of Dwayne Johnson since childhood.",/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2021,helghast-1337,8," Surprisingly good first episode.
","Found this on my dvr that records all prime time shows. Thought it was going to be awful because, while I like the rock, frankly I don't like his movies. I did like ballers but that's about it. Decided to give it a shot while I was folding laundry and surprisingly liked it. Looking forward to the next episodes but going into it with zero expectations is the way to go.",/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2021,rochfordsimon,6," 1st episode in and Meh!..not really Smelling it.
","Was looking forward to this show but I've been let down. It's well produced and put together.
But the acting is over the top. Every single person is constantly smiling. Cheesy to the max. The comedy is one dimensional.",/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2021,freddy_at_home,5," The honest truth review! It's not funny enough
","I think The Rock is cool, I follow him on IG and I think he is a really good role model. But I agree with some on here, everybody loves him and because of that everything he does is gold to them. Sadly, this is not the case here in this show.",/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2021,FrankHonest,1," The arrogance...
",The sheer psychopathic narcissism to even conceive of a show with this premise about yourself. It's sick. Truly sickening levels of clinical narcissism.,/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2021,nicole-44170,10," My new favorite comedy
","My husband and I love the show. It's cute, funny, charming, and a nice relaxing break. It's real without being too real and cute without being too corny. We like half hour funny shows now and then and this is definitely one of our new favorites.",/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2021,paulguevin,9," Leaving you wanting more
",Excellent show well done and had me in tears laughing especially that final scene was everything I could hope for as both a life long wrestling and comedy fan. Can't wait for more keep it going!!,/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2021,bondovw,8," Its a good show
",I think younger people might not appreciate or understand some of this show. I get it and really want more. I like the rock and look forward to learning more about him.,/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2021,krazysoon,1," Between The Rock and a hard place
","It was only a matter of time before Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson made a show about himself. Heck, he plays the same role in all of his movies with the same facial expressions. As for the show, I went in with a open mind and of course I was disappointed. The show isn't funny. It had its moments but this show should've not been made. Great idea on paper I'm sure, but the execution was poor. I'd be surprised if the show lasts for more than a couple of seasons. I will not give up on the show just yet but it has left a bad taste in my mouth.",/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2021,rorygunn,5," The interesting parts are th Rocky Johnson parts.
",It was good to see Rocky Johnson personified on screen as his story in real life is an inspiring one.In fact the parts we get to see are the only interesting things about this show which to me doesn't exactly show Dwayne Johnson in a flattering light.In fact it hits home the fact that Johnson should have been a heel in wrestling from the start instead of starting him off as a babyface.I'm sure there is also a lot of kayfabing going on in this show but that is to be expected.I will say a lot care and time was put into the casting on all fronts and that's what helps an otherwise not so inspiring story that no one seemed to be clamoring for.,/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2021,michaelgumbo,8," It's pretty funny!
","I have to be honest, I was half expecting this to be corny and just another failed pilot but boy was I wrong. It's heartfelt, cute and somewhat relatable. The characters are likeable and make for an easy watch. I really hope to see more of this show, it feels honest without being overbearing. I respected The Rock before this but if half the stories he shares in this sitcom are true he's a truly remarkable person. Definitely worth watching!",/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2021,Engerek01,2," This isn't funny
","I love Dwayne and I admire his back story. He obviously had a life that might be worth telling. However, the way they did this is extremely awful.",/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2021,banzanbon,9," SUCH a fun and actually original show!
","This show is done sooo well! I'm not only impressed, I had so much fun watching the first 12 episodes.",/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2021,MAGALUV,1," Horrible show! Who allowed this mess
","2 episodes in and I'm done. This is one of the WORST shows I've ever seen. The writing is lame, the ""acting"" is stale and wooden. Who allowed this unfunny mess to be shown on T. V..... They need to be FIRED! Avoid at all costs. This is pure garbage GRADE: F.",/review/rw6787858/?ref_=tt_urv
