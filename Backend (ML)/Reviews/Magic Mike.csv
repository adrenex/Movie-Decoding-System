13 January 2023,paul-allaer,6," ""Tough As Nails"" reminding competition for climbers
","As Episode 1 of ""The Climb"" (2023 release; 8 episodes ranging from 36 to 51 min) opens, we are in Mallorca, where legendary climber Chris Sharma and actor Jason ""Aquaman"" Momoa are scouting for a good location to start a climbing competition ""to inspire the next generation of climber"". We are introduced to10 amateur climbers from various countries (primarily the US, the UK and Brazil), who are competing for $100,000 in cash plus $100,000 in sponsorships. At this point we are less than 10 minutes into Episode 1.",/review/rw8850614/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2023,joshuafischerr,4," Tried hard to like it but I just can't
","First off, when I heard Chris Sharma, my childhood hero, was creating a show I was instantly filled with excitement. Now after watching it, I have lost some respect for my once viewed idol.",/review/rw8850614/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2023,myownsuperfan,2," They blew their budget on one hour of Jason Momoa's time
","It was odd to me how boring I found a show about one of my favorite topics. It was kind of cool that the skill level was super relatable, like oh wow, me and all my friends could be on this show. But the production just left everyone looking like they had zero charisma and only the most banal insights. They'll interview like 3 climbers in a row saying things like ""I could tell she was getting tired, then she fell.""",/review/rw8850614/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,dloomis-34578,5," Good premise tarnished by diversity over climbing skill
","I like reality TV shows, and I like climbing shows and films (even though I do not climb), so I was looking forward to this show. The premise, I think, is great, and the hosts do a good job.",/review/rw8850614/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2023,expatrickdale,5," A climbing show without much climbing
","I've climbed a lot, and was looking forward to seeing this show. However, it's a climbing show without much climbing and too much talking about climbing. The competitors are so right-on and full of BS with their ""I love you,"" and ""totally"" and ""you're so beautiful"" ""no YOU'RE beautiful."" It's genuinely annoyingly and distracting - like totally. FFS.",/review/rw8850614/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,connorlwork,8," It's a great watch
","The Climb not only showcased the art of climbing rock - it's an art - but also the incredible characters and community that surround it. I felt they did a wonderful job in casting ten thoughtful characters from all walks of life, who brought their own perspective, and their own pain to overcome. That, combined with some A+ cinematography, and this show was great to watch.",/review/rw8850614/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2023,seepaulasign,8," New to Rock Climbing?
","""The Climb"" has been carefully crafted to test a variety of climbing styles to challenge contestants from around the world to crown a winner!",/review/rw8850614/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,wrapper-96237,1," Testosterone wins!
","Ever seen a person win a sporting competition on performance enhancing drugs? Yeah. That's literally all that happens. The dude taking testosterone won. Big surprise. Lack of any cool shots the whole time too. So no cool shots of them clipping in to things or anything. I saw him drill a hole and shove one of those ring things if that counts. But that wasn't even part of the competition and even if it was it doesn't count. Plenty of cuts to other closeup shots but no just views of them climbing the wall so you can get an idea of how they climb or if they're fast. You only have the judges saying ""that was fast"" as they finish the climb and you're over here wondering why every shot took that out of perspective totally. No education on climbing or how it really works so we're over here asking things about how the gear they use works rather than watching the show and having literally ANY of that explained to us. Just poorly planned it feels like. Just completely underwhelming. I feel like I've seen Red Bull commercials that were more action packed and had better shots. This felt like it sounded like a good idea but then you see the execution and it's just bad in every way. Not to mention they let somebody on testosterone win. Then they say things like ""wow he just does not rest"". Uhm... Duh.",/review/rw8850614/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,hagenvolta,1," Sudden death on v4, did you know the max grade is v17.
","Chris Sharma failed hard on this one, instead doing a rock climbing show, he did something that follow the trending ideol√≥gical ideas. So this rock climbing show went wrong since the begining, please save your time, instead search for the reel rock or Kings of the lines where you will see the real chris sharma. I doubt to see more than 2 chapters because this is a drama show where only selected real amaterish climbers, if he look for real rock climbers, some of them are not behind chris sharma, some of them maybe beat him, so please save your time and see everything else, this is not rock climbing, Just imagine they went to sudden death in a boulder v4, the highest boulder problem is v17, in my gym there amateur dudes Who Climb v12.",/review/rw8850614/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,nickvas71,10," Great show overall, but it should look less like the rest of the ""bs competition shows""
","Sharma is fantastic, his potential and appeal are endless. Jason is a magnet and Meagan is great. But climbing is not pottery or baking. Maybe it's a bit like blacksmithing, where the process creates enough drama by itself.",/review/rw8850614/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2023,naydelinmg,1," Misleading
","Jason Momoa isn't even on the show. The show is just plain boring and tedious to watch. And I don't know a thing about rock climbing but I wanna believe that there is more to it than ""keep going"" and ""focus"" to it, but I guess the directors just assume I know what they are talking about(?). I would still like to know what exactly makes you a legendary climber. They provide no information about any of the contestants, like their height or their weight, which I think could be something you might wanna consider in order to try to measure their ability. The whole thing just seems very rushed and I do believe they miss a lot of crucial points and get lost on mundane stuff. I could not make it past the 3rd episode, save yourself some time, it really isn't that good.",/review/rw8850614/?ref_=tt_urv
