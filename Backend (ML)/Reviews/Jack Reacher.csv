30 January 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10," Disney's best film in a long time!
","I am a huge Disney and animation fan, and was really interested in seeing Tangled. For me Disney have so many classics under their wing, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Bambi, Pinocchio, The Little Mermaid and Aladdin especially. For over a decade, the past Disney films ranged from very enjoyable(Emperor's New Groove) to truly disappointing(Chicken Little)- The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Tarzan were the last ones to truly blow me away- until now.",/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2010,planktonrules,10," wonderful...
","I was frankly quite amazed by this film. After all, last year Pixar brought us ""Up"" and this year Dreamworks brought us ""How to Train Your Dragon""—there was no way that anyone could produce a CGI film that is every bit as good, could they?! Yet, surprisingly, I adored ""Tangled"" and enjoyed it just as much as these other films—showing that we are in a period of time when amazingly wonderful computer animation has become the norm.",/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Tangled
","A wonderful movie! I had forgotten all about Tangled, and am so glad I got to see it on the big screen. A great story with fun characters and beautiful animation that still looks new.",/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2010,DarkVulcan29,10," Quite a fun time being Tangled.
","Flynn Ryder(voice by Zachery Levi) a charming but clumsy thief, who after a heist, and nearly escapes with his life, finds his way too a tower, that appears to be isolated, but it's not, cause an 18 year old girl named Rapunzel(voiced by Mandy Moore) with magical long hair lives there. She strikes a bargain with Flynn, Rapunzel has hidden his stolen goods, and tells him that if he takes her to see a mysterious lights in the sky, Flynn agrees to it, but the question is will they get there?",/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2011,leplatypus,10," Long live the Hairness ! (screen)
","I liked so much this movie that i watched it two times on screen (my last back-to-back was ""Indi 4""): one with my nephews and the other alone but in 3D and as usual, 3D ins't the ultimate experience (Imax is better) because eyes get used quickly and the colors are darker.",/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2010,blackmambamark,8," Disney, where have you been all this time?
","Honestly, when is the last time you saw a decent Disney Animated feature? No no, PIXAR does not count. I'm talking about just a regular ol' straight laced Disney flick. If your like me, I'm sure your answer falls somewhere in the mid 90's. But isn't that a shame? What happened to the totally awesome Disney movies? If your excuse is because of technology, i assure you that your wrong. You can make a great animated movie without resorting to actual hand drawn art. But where is that old feeling we all use to share? Well i can tell you this much....i already knew that Disney had something special here, mainly because the VP of PIXAR jumped ship and decided to fund this project. The first time anyone from PIXAR has ever done so, let alone the freakin VP. So needless to say, Disney finally had enough, and pulled out all the stops for this one.",/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2010,Blueghost,," Excellent family entertainment.
","A few days ago I saw ""Megamind"", and thought it was just okay. I enjoyed it for what it was, but I didn't think it too spectacular. My faith in CGI entertainment was on the wane.",/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2011,thekyles99,10," Disney keeps putting these kind of films out I will be a fan in no time!
","Omg how i moaned when the daughter wanted me to sit down and watch this with her as so i finally did and yes i will not complain again about the wonders of Disney! This was such a well put together story by the team of Nathan Greyo and Byron Howard, the same team who brought us another goody from Disney ""Bolt "" They seem to like revolving their stories about young girls who dream of being either stars or princesses. This time they take on the old fairy tale classic Rapunzel with of coarse putting their very own twist on the tale. Disney movies used to turn me off as i just couldn't get by the musical numbers that usually accompanied them however I thank the TV show 'Glee' for turning my taste patterns around, it's not such a bad thing. Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore ) has been held captive due to her long magical locks of hair, in a tower, now a teenager she spends the days trying to keep herself busy amidst her tight surroundings by dreaming of stars and playing with her only friend in life a small chameleon. When a chance and surprising visit from a fleeing thief who only scaled the tower to avoid be captured by the royal guards barges into her life changing it for all the good. A great story that had me , who slowly is becoming more and more of a fan of Disney's day by day, actually wanting more as the 80 or so mins just flew by. Attention to all dad's out there... it's not that bad just give it chance!!",/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2010,maestro-20,9," Disney's back with their fairytale
","I was apprehensive, to say the least, when I went to see Tangled, after the disappointment that was Princess and the Frog. First, Disney's back with CGI animation, which hasn't really worked that great except, maybe to some extent, Bolt. Second, the trailers made it look really slapstick -- I'm rather wary of today's animation features that try too hard to be hip and fast-paced and silly.",/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2017,Hitchcoc,8," Nicely Crafted Tale
","Everyone knows the story. The girl, Rapunzel, with the golden hair, kept up in a tower. She is only visited by one person who controls her. Of course, unless she were headstrong, nothing would happen in this film. And, of course, she is. Also, we know that to fulfill her dreams a guy is going to show up. This time, however, the rules get changed a bit and the formula is broken as well. I didn't gravitate toward this one as much as previous Disney films, but it was still very good. I think the title is great. I think the plot moves along at a nice pace and Rapunzel is quite interesting. Once again, the animation is superior.",/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2012,dylanhook,10," Definitely one of the best animated films I've seen...a guy's review
","Let me start by saying that I'm an 18 year old male, and was kinda dragged into watching this by my girlfriend, who is a big fan of the Disney princess movies. I finally gave in the other day, and I've very glad that I did. ",/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2010,judywalker2,10," What all movies should be.
",Disney is back with Tangled and they have finally found themselves again. First I have to say as much as I loved Tangled it made me sad and angry that Disney could not accomplish the same thing for The Princess and the Frog. Here was there one chance to showcase a Black princess and they missed the mark by a football field. Well so much for that.,/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2011,Vincentiu,," Seductive
","A Grimm brothers old story. Mystery. Love story. Few drops of magic. And reunited family. In Disney package. Result - seductive movie about truth, beauty and power of hope. Some music and a good product. Or madlene for adults. Seed of generous business. And new clothes for small words of childhood. Crazy characters, strange horse and impressive princess in the cell of her hair. A thief as Prince Charming and new mask of Cruella. And more that. The impression that all is more than food in new plate. Air of freedom and colors of age of dreams, honey of expecting and soft humor, fights like in good times and the sacrifice for grow-up of tears. A film behind fashion. Image of impressive work - six years - , extraordinary music, hided special effects and memories of a beautiful show. That is all!",/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2012,iloveUGA123,10," Disney's princess movies are back!!
","I absolutely loved this movie!! Disney originally tried making another princess movie a few years ago, Princess and the Frog. That movie was not good at all!! Disney is known for their amazing princess movies, and that was not one of them, and I have know idea what happened with that movie! Now that Disney has made this movie, they are back on top with their incredible princess movies!! The music was wonderful, and the movie was a little different from their usual princess movies. This one was funner and more modern, but they still had the whole princess feel to it, which is what Disney is known for! Disney's other movies, that don't have music, and aren't a princess movie that have been coming out over the years are good too. They just haven't made a princess movie like this one since The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, etc. I would definitely watching this movie, no matter what age! Especially if you grew up watching their princess movie, I absolutely know that you will love this movie!",/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2011,SGuy157,9," Couldn't Have Been Better
","I will start off by simply saying that this movie is excellent. No, the word excellent doesn't even describe this movie well enough, because it is better than excellent. I could not take my eyes away movie for the hour and a half of the film. Even if the movie was seven hours long my eyes would still be glued to the screen for the whole time. Along with Up, this has to be the best animated movie ever made.",/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2010,neonboy619,10," A True Return to Disney Classics
","Tangled continues in Disney's animation legacy of timeless classics. Being Disney's first fairy tale outing done in CGI, it's easy to have doubts. The marketing for this film didn't really do Tangled any favors either. Originally titled Rapunzel, the name change to Tangled and the shift of focus onto the male co-star Flynn Ryder in the merchandising was done as a way to try to get more boys into the theater. Despite this faulty marketing move, Tangled is very much Rapunzel's story and Rapunzel is the star of this instant classic. Sticking very close to the roots of the original German Rapunzel fairy tale, Tangled's story is one about overprotective parental figures and the need to want to break free. Mandy Moore voices Rapunzel and sings for her. Yup, this a musical. This is a big grand musical in the classical Disney style with songs by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater. Alan Menken was the one who brought Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and Enchanted to life; to name only a few. Moore really gets to the heart of Rapunzel and truly owns the part, but the real surprise is Donna Murphy as our main villain Mother Gothel. A true hero is measured by it's main villain and Mother Gothel does not disappoint.",/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2010,jergasmic,10," A New Classic.
","I was very sketchy walking into this movie. I didn't know what to expect, it's Disney which is promising, but it's also Disney's first CGI Disney movie that got a PG rating, so it seemed different. It was pretty hard for me to choose between 'Tangled' or 'Burlesque' but I'm glad I made the decision to watch 'Tangled'. ",/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2011,dutchs-1,10," Best Disney Heroine Ever
","I'll never get this magic stuff. If you put a magic flower under a basket, won't it die from lack of light? And if you use it to save the queen in childbirth, why will the baby have magic powers? And why her hair? That's why I flunked out of Hogwarts. But what a fun film. Rapunzel is not just beautiful, she's seriously cute. And unlike the saintly Snow White and Cinderella, she's got a marvelous streak of spitfire in her. There's hilarious slapstick and barbed dialog. The villainess is classic Disney wicked stepmother, smarmy and selfish, whose physical beauty only serves to accentuate the evil within. She meets a most satisfying demise. The lighting of the lanterns, Rapunzel's whole motivation for leaving her tower, is breathtakingly beautiful. And on a technical note, this film got a writeup in Scientific American for advancing the frontiers of animation. Previously, extremely complicated motions of hair or clothing became rigid because the algorithms couldn't handle the complexity. The animators solved that problem. Also, a flood scene is the most lifelike CGI water I've ever seen. My only complaint, which made me consider giving the movie a 9, is that wicked stepmom has a couple of tedious musical numbers that the film could have omitted with no loss.",/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2010,slcjared,10," My Favorite Disney Movie
","I saw the finished movie at the screening before the wrap party. The movie works on every level. The Characters, the animation, the story, the score, the romance, and it's all very cute as well (in a way Disney can apparently still pull off). ",/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2011,cbluvsact,10," Get your butt to the theater and see this movie!
","I have seen this movie 3 times as of today, and possibly 4 as of next week, if that gives anyone a good idea of what a fantastic movie this is. Tangled is now my favorite of the 50 Disney animated movies out there, or any animated movie for that matter. Despite fans of the classic Disney princess being down on the CGI animation, I to the contrary found that this was a vast improvement. The scenery and basic concepts were still classic Disney, but the CGI made them movie vivid and realistic but in a cute animated way. The characters were all very deep, and all added their own humorous aspects to the movie. Repunzel was a bad ass without being violent, and more lovable than the rest of the princesses combined. The prince was actually a bandit role (Flynn) and way more dimensional than previous princes. He was a main part of the movie, and he added a great contrast to Repunzel's naive heroine. I left having a crush on Flynn, and wanting to go to the pet store to buy a pet chameleon. I predict that at the end of the movie you will leave feeling lighter at heart, and transported back to being a wide eyed youngster. Well, I did anyway.",/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2010,hayonthego,10," Incredibly fun movie
","I will start by saying that I am a 62 year old grandfather of three (9, 8, and 5) who has no connection to Disney in any way. I took the grandkids today to see this movie and they loved it, as did I. The 3D is worth going to. There is enough silliness, adventure, and romance to allow boys and girls of almost all ages to love this show. There were some funny lines in the show that kids would not understand, but adults would enjoy. I heard a gentleman laughing throughout the whole show. I am not around teenagers, so I am not sure how a teenager would respond to this show. The storyline was different but predictable. That should not discourage anyone from going to this show. I would rate it as one of the best, if not the best animation show I have ever seen. This show is a winner as a family show.",/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2011,lvilaguillen,10," One word... Disney!
","One word came to my mind when I saw this magnificent work of art: Disney. Then I just knew how was it gonna be... what a beautiful movie! what a great characters! As many of you I'm gonna sound repetitive but... it surely worths it... Disney's classics are back. And there's no Pixar in here... no mates, that was all Disney! What we have here is a real Disney Princess (not like that sad intend to go back in time with The Princess and The Frog), a real one. With a dream, with a lovely voice, and no boundaries! Who wants to go beyond and beyond... and what is most important... she takes us with her! I felt there inside from the very beginning until the end. And of course without adding the fact that there's unexpected parts: no one can say that the end (you know what I mean, not to spoiler you) was expected... TOTALLY AWESOME! (when I've got here in fact I felt like you all were reading my mind!!! All of us where in the same theater, in front of the same screen the whole movie). My speech is intended to transmit all my passion! Would you mind reading?",/review/rw2349483/?ref_=tt_urv
