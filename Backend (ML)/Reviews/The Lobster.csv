","As I was watching this movie today, I realized it's one of the most important film in mcu. It has tons of elements that are used heavily in future MCU films, eg",/review/rw3225759/?ref_=tt_urv

8 May 2016,Movie_Muse_Reviews,7," Messier, for sure, but still plenty of ""Avengers"" fun
","The task of bringing together Earth's mightiest heroes took Joss Whedon into uncharted territory with 2012's ""The Avengers,"" and, despite the weight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe on his shoulders, the results were staggeringly entertaining. The task of making a sequel to that ground-breaking, monumental event film, however, and being expected to deliver on par or better results, is an entirely different beast.",/review/rw3225759/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2020,sammielimehouse,8," Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) Review - 8.3/10
","This film isn't nearly as bad as some people make it out to be. While the story isn't as good as the first Avengers, the acting is still just as good, the action is even better, and Ultron isn't a bad villain, he's just an under-developed one. Honestly, the action makes up for most of the flaws of this movie and it also set up a lot of MCU films, or at least foreshadowed a lot. Movies like Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame, and Captain America: Civil War. Overall, this isn't a bad film, at all, but it is the weakest of The Avengers franchise.",/review/rw3225759/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2015,xamtaro,6," The son of Megatron and Skynet meets Tony Stark and his Amazing Friends
","In 2012, there came a day unlike any other day where the worlds greatest heroes were united against a common threat and THE AVENGERS blew away audiences of all ages with the first ever comic book movie crossover. In 2015, there came another day unlike any other day and this time the world is threatened by a Ultron, the cynical critical atypical child of Skynet and Megatron...... No actually he's just a wisecracking artificial intelligence with delusions of godhood and all round evil. Turning on his creators, he threatens all life on earth with his sidekicks ""illusion- woman"" and ""not-the-flash""....I mean, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, and it is up to the Avengers to take him out before he can usher in THE AGE OF ULTRON.

25 December 2020,morrison-dylan-fan,8," The Avengers:Issue 2.
","During the break I had from watching the MCU between The Avengers and Captain America: Civil War, (2012 & 2016-both also reviewed) this was the main entry I read that people had problems with. Catching up on the issues I missed in those years on Disney+,I got set to witness the age of Ultron.",/review/rw3225759/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2021,andreascaloni,7," VERY GOOD SEQUEL
","In Avengers Age of Ultron the Avengers fight Ultron, an artificial intelligence obsessed with causing human extinction. The movie is a mostly satisfying sequel. It's full of action and darker than the first one. Sometimes it has a great sense of humour, the main villain is well characterized and the final act is full of tension and emotional. However in the first half isn't always gripping and there are some ridicolous moments. It isn't as good as the first one but it's still a fun and entertaining ride to join.",/review/rw3225759/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2016,ivo-cobra8,10," Avengers: Age of Ultron is a damn good Superhero flick, excellent sequel!
","Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) is a MARVEL damn good superhero flick and an excellent sequel! Yes it is miles way better than Jurassic World and Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Terminator Genisys I have enjoyed this film much better than Jurassic World, Star Wars and Terminator the new movies.

","being a huge Marvel fan, and also Josh Whedon fan I was super excited for him to come back and do another Avengers movie. The first film was pretty brilliant. But with this film, Whedon wasn't given much air to breathe, with constant Studio interference and orders of certain shots to be re- done, or scrapped if not worse.

21 August 2015,siderite,8," Action followed by action then, surprisingly, some character development. Then some more action.
","So everybody must be asking now: ""Is it worth watching more than two hours of this just to get to the obligatory Thanos end credits scene?"" and the answer is... yes. Besides making fun of War Machine - again - and completely ignoring characters like Pepper Potts and Falcon, there was nothing that bothered me tremendously about this film. Keep in mind that it is a comic book film with superheros that dress funny, though.",/review/rw3225759/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2016,miguelneto-74936,6," Disappointing
","Disappointing, it summarizes Avengers: Age of Ultron, the film is not bad, it's cool just cool, it is frustrating because all the world expected to be better than the first Avengers Ultron which is one of the best villains of the Marvel Comics he is simply poorly executed in this movie, really the film beginning excited about the action scenes, the effects are excellent, the CGI movie is hardly exaggerated, Mercury and another character very badly used, as the scarlet witch for a future in this universe Marvel, the film is unnecessary scenes, the jokes are always in the wrong time it breaks the film's climax, and the end where the Hulk flees the ship hope to explain in the Civil War film, now the worst thing in the movie, Hawkeye it has more space than owed it gets to be ridiculous, he can tip the witch and the mercury that was really ridiculous, the final scene of the movie was good most not enough to thrill, Avengers: Age of Ultron is not even bad, far from it, more we expected so that was better than the first to disappoint.

28 April 2015,Theo Robertson,5," Never As Profound As It Thinks It Is
","I really should keep up on Superhero movies . But there's a reason I don't - I simply don't like them . They personify everything I dislike about modern Hollywood blockbusters , lots of explosions , lots of stunts and lots of CGI . It's less like watching a film and more like logging on to youtube and watching gameplay of the latest state of the art computer game ",/review/rw3225759/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Avengers raid a Hydra base in Sokovia commanded by Strucker and they retrieve Loki's scepter. They also discover that Strucker had been conducting experiments with the orphan twins Pietro Maximoff (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who has super speed, and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), who can control minds and project energy. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) discovers an Artificial Intelligence in the scepter and convinces Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) to secretly help him to transfer the A.I. to his Ultron defense system. However, the Ultron understands that is necessary to annihilate mankind to save the planet, attacks the Avengers and flees to Sokovia with the scepter. He builds an armature for self-protection and robots for his army and teams up with the twins. The Avengers go to Clinton Barton's house to recover, but out of the blue, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) arrives and convinces them to fight against Ultron. Will they succeed? ",/review/rw3225759/?ref_=tt_urv

25 July 2016,OllieSuave-007,4," A lackluster superhero flick
","This movie takes a long time to gain any steam, with a lot of all talk and no action in the first half of the movie. There is also little suspense and intrigue - just the superheroes pondering and conjuring their next mission, with Tony Stark and Bruce Banner creating a project called Ultron to act as a peacekeeping program serving as the movie's backdrop.",/review/rw3225759/?ref_=tt_urv

30 April 2015,ThomasDrufke,9," The Beginning to the End
","This is why I love going to the movies. For two hours, I can forget everything that sucks about the real world and enjoy watching earth's mightiest, (and gosh darn it funniest) heroes (you're welcome Cap for not using the other word). I've always been more of a DC guy, but Marvel movies are just pure entertainment. Joss Whedon may have given us the funniest Marvel movie yet. Whether it was the Thor hammer gag about getting 'it up' or not, Captain America's bad language issues, or Hawkeye poking fun at himself, Age of Ultron was incredibly fun. To top all that, and the first film, Ultron is loaded with action that feels like it's straight out of the comic books.",/review/rw3225759/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2015,charzhino,6," Grossly underwhelming (spoiler free)
","Spoiler free review. Let me first start of by saying that I am not a Marvel ''fanboy'' or a DC nerd. The comic book genre of films have made it to my personal top 3 favourite genres in the last decade and the MCU has been a strong contributor to that rise. I hold the first Ironman, first Avengers and Captain America 1+2 in high regard. I did not like the direction they took with Iron Man 3 (more on this below) or Guardians of the Galaxy but Winter Soldier was a gem in terms of balancing solid action, drama and levity.",/review/rw3225759/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2021,kaden_lewis,9," Avengers: Age of Ultron
","Why all the hate? I know this is isn't on the level of ""The Avengers"" but it was still really good. I enjoyed the plot and story of this movie, I liked how we were introduced to new actors, and I also liked that we sort of got s glimpse into the franchises future. I thought the plot of needing to stop a ultra peace keeping robot from trying to make the human race extinct for peace was really good, and I think James Spader did a great job playing the role. I also liked the story of the movie to go along with it. Another thing I liked was that we were introduced to Wanda and Pietro Maximoff (Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver). I also though the acting from Elisabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson was great. It sucks we had to lose Pietro, he didn't even need to die, I feel the writers were just looking for a reason to write home out. I also liked how we got a little look into the future of the franchise with the Avengers trip to Wakanda. The last thing I liked about this movie was when Wanda gave most of the Avengers their dream sequences, sure, they were a little weird, but I thought they were pretty cool.",/review/rw3225759/?ref_=tt_urv
