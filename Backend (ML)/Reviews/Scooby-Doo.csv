25 February 2022,planktonrules,6," Probably stranger than most folks will want, but Anderson groupies will surely love it.
","Wes Anderson has made many films people have loved as well as many films people are baffled by and don't understand nor like. This isn't a complaint...it just IS what Anderson's films are like to the average viewer. However, some of his movies are clearly much more approachable than others. ""The French Dispatch"" is NOT one of the more approachable films...it clearly will appeal mostly to the hard-core Anderson freaks.",/review/rw8365071/?ref_=tt_urv

23 October 2021,boblipton,8," Just Sit Back And Enjoy Yourself
","Wes Anderson's latest movie, under thinly disguised names, supposes that Harold Ross, instead of going to Manhattan to found THE NEW YORKER, had moved to France. There, with the same writers and cartoonists, he turned out essentially the same magazine, but with, understandably, more of an emphasis on France than on Broadway. We are then graced with Bill Murray as the editor dealing with his writers, as Tilda Swinton narrates her tale of insane prisoner Benicio Del Toro inventing a new movement in art; Frances MacDormand covering a student uprising while bedding leader Timothée Chalamet, while editing and writing an appendix to his revolutionary manifesto; and Jeffrey Wright covering the novelties of ""cuisine policier"" with the commissioner, which turns into a hot pursuit as the commissioner's child is kidnapped, and his chef must take the lead in the recovery.",/review/rw8365071/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2021,varun-25071997,6," Strong in Aesthetics, Weak In Content
","When one goes to a Wes Anderson film, we exactly know what to expect. In French Dispatch, Wes Anderson gives us everything we expect but he seems to have focused too much on aesthetics and less in the script. The film resembles like a spiritual sequel to Grand Budapest Hotel, but lacked it's strong characters and bullet speed screenplay.",/review/rw8365071/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2022,gbill-74877,6," Beautiful, but falls short
","Incredible cast, and Wes Anderson's style is always visually appealing, but the short stories that make up The French Dispatch fell flat for me. The attention to detail and sly references were great as a concept, but seemed overdone, to the detriment of evenness (or comprehension) in the plot and characters that I cared about. It needed a better script, one that was pruned down and had more heart. It was fantastic seeing all of these actors, though most are underused to say the least. Loved Jeffrey Wright in this though.",/review/rw8365071/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2021,eddie_baggins,5," A very Andersony film that lacks a real heart or soul
","In many ways The French Dispatch feels like the most Wes Andersony movie you could ask for but despite it possessing all the little quirks, stylings and scattered goodness's of the beloved indie director, Anderson's latest star studded affair doesn't come close to becoming a film worthy of standing alongside the likes of Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums or The Grand Budapest Hotel.",/review/rw8365071/?ref_=tt_urv

16 December 2021,CinemaClown,," This Is It. Wes Anderson Films Are Not For Me.
",I couldn't care. I just couldn't bring myself to care for anything that happens in this film or for any character who inhabits this story or for any actor who is a part of its ensemble or for any stylistic choices the director makes. A Wes Anderson film at first looked wonderfully quaint & quirky to me and I've given them the benefit of doubt over the years. But not anymore. This is it.

","The bad:
Now the beautiful and typical Wes Anderson choreography has become a gimmick. Style over content. In Wes Anderson's former films, the story was leading. Now the gimmicks of choreography are leading. The story is completely disjointed and fragmented.",/review/rw8365071/?ref_=tt_urv

","Series of short stories that felt disconnected, i.e. Like random short stories. Seemed as if the writers/directors were focused on how experimental they could be. I felt no connection or interest in the stories & their characters. I dozed off twice. Lots of screen time spent on cheap animation supposedly to help - nope.",/review/rw8365071/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2021,Horst_In_Translation,6," Still has its moments, but a massive drop in quality in the second half keeps this way below Anderson's finest career achievements
","""The French Dispatch"" is the newest film by writer and director Wes Anderson. He is in his early 50s now and is probably considered among the most overdue filmmakers in Hollywood to finally win an Oscar, especially in terms of writing. Unfortunately, this work here will not get him any closer because I believe it is inferior compared to most of the stuff he has done in the past and if it gets nominated, then for art direction or something. But first things first: This runs for briefly under 110 minutes and Anderson once again worked with Hugo Guinness, Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman and this quartet came up with the story. Basically, it is several stories in one film. We have the framework and three pretty much independent stories that are articles from the paper this is all about. The French Dispatch. The cast, as always with Wes Anderson, is packed with big names and he also has a tendency to cast people who he worked with in previous films. I will not give you all the names because you can check out the list yourself. Even some characters who had almost no screen time at all are played by very familiar faces (Henry Winkler for example, I recognized him immediately, but the name I just could not remember while watching). But some actors who get a lot of screen time are Oscar winners Benicio Del Toro and Frances McDormand. Also Timothée Chalamet is included a lot here. Jeffrey Wright gets a solid amount of minutes in the final chapter. I personally also found it nice to see Adrien Brody here as one of Anderson's regulars because I liked the actor (another Oscar winner) and I don't see him that often in other projects anymore nowadays. Tilda Swinton I must admit I did not even recognize. She is so much better usually than in this film, even if the material is to blame for the most part. Nothing to work with kinda. One of three females though exposing their breasts. Lyna Khoudri (another one) was easy on the eyes for sure. Willem Dafoe definitely did not have a lot of screen time and I would have liked him to be featured a lot more here. What can I say, I like the actor. A lot.",/review/rw8365071/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2021,ferguson-6,8," the most Wes Anderson-y to date
","Greetings again from the darkness. Few things in the cinematic world are more instantly recognizable than a Wes Anderson movie. In fact, historically speaking, perhaps only Jacques Tati comes as close to having a signature style easily spotted by viewers. This is Mr. Anderson's 10th feature film in 25 years, and I now rate 5 of these very highly, though all 10 have a certain appeal. This latest, co-written by Anderson with frequent collaborators Roman Coppola, Hugo Guinness, and Jason Schwartzman, could be considered his most ambitious to date ... and likely the most 'Wes Anderson' of all.",/review/rw8365071/?ref_=tt_urv

","A triumph of style and artistry, The French Despatch is also witty and clever, but it might leave you cold if you don't like the quirky, arty, and, frankly, sometimes quite pretentious and self-indulgent Wes Anderson approach. Like other films of his, it's marvellous to look at, there are some funny moments from the huge star studded cast, and despite the reservations mentioned, the French Despatch is classy.",/review/rw8365071/?ref_=tt_urv

19 November 2021,Solnichka,5," The worst Wes Anderson film in quite some time
","Seriously, I fell asleep twice: the first time during the Manifesto bit and the second time during kidnapping bit. This was just terrible; the artist in prison segment was the best one by far, and it's all downhill from there. And what a waste of talent! So many fantastic actors were barely on screen in this one. If you like Wes Anderson stuff like I do, maybe you will overlook the flaws and praise it anyway. But if you're being honest with yourself, this is one tenth the film MOONRISE KINGDOM was, for example.",/review/rw8365071/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2021,euroGary,8," Huge fun, mostly
","'The French Dispatch' consists of three main stories, so it is probably inevitable that one of them is less successful than the others. It is nothing to do with the actors concerned - principally Tilda Swinton, Benicio Del Toro, Adrien Brody and Léa Seydoux - simply that the story of an imprisoned artist becoming The Next Big Thing drags a bit. The other main segments - Frances McDormand and Timothée (still not sure how to pronounce that) Chalamet in a tale of student unrest; and Jeffrey Wright, Mathieu Amalric and Liev Schreiber caught up in a police operation including a kidnapped child and fine dining - are rollicking good fun.",/review/rw8365071/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2022,Pimilli,3," I couldn't. I just couldn't anymore.
","I've liked Wes Anderson in the past. The Royal Tenenbaums, The Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Grandbudapest Hotel, but this was where I jump off. It's the excessive narration and self-indulgence. After a while it gets too precious. The first vignette with Benicio was good. Then at the end of the second vignette with Frances McDormand we looked at each other, my wife and I, and we had had enough. His visual style is wonderful, the art direction should win something and possibly the cinematography, but overall the movie left me cold. With Anderson's style you need a single cast to follow. Once you throw in other things and other vignette's we don't care anymore.",/review/rw8365071/?ref_=tt_urv
