29 March 2007,GRMacE,9," Intensely Human
","If you are looking for a movie that confirms preconceived notions, don't go to this one. Rather than trotting out a character as a rooting interest in the second or third scene, the film presents four individuals who are definitely worthy of your interest and compassion.",/review/rw2735922/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2007,johno-21,9," After the Wedding
","I recently saw this at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival and of the 31 films I saw there this made my top 3. Mads Mikklesen received the festival's Best Actor award for his role as Jacob, a man who runs an orphanage in India. Jacob's been there for 20 years and is quite content in never returning to Denmark. A wealthy Danish businessman (Rolf Lassård) has contacted the orphanage expressing a desire to donate a large sum of money to keep the orphanage going. Jacob is led to believe that if he flies to Denmark and presents his business plan it will be a shake hands-smile-done deal and he will return within a week. Jørgen, the businessman has other plans however for Jacob. Sidse Babett Knudsen is Jørgen's wife Helene who has something in common with Jacob. Stine Fischer Christiansen is Anna, the daughter of Jörgen and Helene who is getting married to Christian (Christian Tafdrop) who is employed by Jörgen's company. Jacob is encouraged to attend the wedding and the real reason why he's been summoned to Denmark begins to unravel. Following the success of 2002's Open Hearts and 2004's Brother writer/director Susane Bier again collaborates with screenwriter Anders Thomas Jensen in this emotional drama. Efter brylluppet (After the Wedding) has been nominated for Best Foreign Language Film for the Academy Awards but I would believe that El Laberinto del Fauno (Pan's Labyrinth) is likely the odds-on favorite to win the Oscar. This is Denmarks 7th nomination for Best Foreign Film since 1956 and it's first nomination since 1989. Denmark has won two Oscar's for Best Foreign films in 1987 for Babette's Feast and 1988 for Pelle the Conqueror. This film is good enough that it has a chance but it would be an upset. This is a very good story and beautifully photographed by cinematographer Mørtin Soberg. I would give this a 9.0 out of 10 and recommend it.",/review/rw2735922/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2007,RagingR2,9," Incredible acting, incredible story.
","As may be expected of Susanne Bier, and as may be expected of Scandinavian films in general if you ask me, this film is really great. The acting is so good it's hard to call it acting. Mads Mikkelsen (Jacob) puts up a terrific performance with acting that is as credible as it is subtle. Not the over-the-top stuff that we are familiar with from Hollywood, but acting that actually makes you think ""yes, this is how real flesh and blood people would react"". I was also pleasantly surprised by Sidse Babett Knudsen (Helene). She has a lot of scenes with little or no dialog, but the way she tells everything with subtle face expression is simply mind blowing. And let's not forget Rolf Lassgård (Jörgen) and Stine Fisher Christensen (Anne), who both remind us what real flesh and blood emotions look like in a way that really hits you in the face.",/review/rw2735922/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2007,come2whereimfrom,9," Brilliant Ocasr contender from last year.
","I knew nothing about this film before going to see it except that it was Oscar nominated and starred Bond's 'Casino Royale' foe Mads Mikkelsen. But I'd heard good things and despite it being a day so sunny in April that you should really spend it in the park I ventured into the dark cinema. All I can say is that I am so, so glad I did as this has to be one of the best films I have seen this year. Jacob (Mikkelsen) runs an orphanage/school in India that due to funding will have to close if they don't do something quickly, cue a phone call from Denmark where a millionaire is looking to invest some money in a good cause and Jacob has no choice but to go home and try to win over the mystery funder. Cut to Copenhagen and the very rich living of Jorgen and his family, a self-made millionaire Jorgen is preparing for the Wedding of his daughter and as his family gather round the mansion we see that he has a pretty good life. Cut back to Jacob who after living in squalid conditions in India for so long is struggling to understand the swish hotel he's been booked in for his visit. When the two meet to discuss the investment Jacob is over enthusiastic but Jorgen is nonchalant and pre-occupied with the weekends approaching festivities, so much so he decides to conclude the deal on Monday and seeing as Jacob is here on his invitation with nothing to do all weekend he decides to ask him to attend the wedding. So far so seemingly normal. It is at this point that the film takes some dramatic turns and through a series of unexpected events, a few skeletons in closets, the past and emotive performances, becomes a really deep and moving piece of cinema. I don't want to spoil it by saying anymore about it except it's nothing short of brilliant. I haven't seen a film for ages that deals with such negative and positive issues with such compassion and integrity without being hammy or over the top. The direction is flawless, the music is fitting and the cinematography is almost dogma in style but with a certain crispness to it. The performances are outstanding and it's not hard to see why it was Oscar nominated and won countless awards. The way the script is superbly written it reminded of 'Secrets and Lies' by Mike Leigh in the way it captures humans acting realistically in real situations. By the time the film starts to conclude the tissues were coming out to wipe away the tears of sadness and joy, which is a very powerful position to be in for any film, and the audience left the auditorium into bright sunshine glad like me that they'd had chance to see this amazing piece of cinema.",/review/rw2735922/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2009,claudio_carvalho,9," Intense and Engaging Family Drama
","In a very poor area of India, the altruist Danish Jacob Pederson (Mads Mikkelsen) teaches and nurses children in an orphanage and has raised the eight year old Pramod since he was a foster baby. When Jacob is invited to travel to Copenhagen to meet the wealthy businessman Jørgen Lennart Hannson (Rolf Lassgård) that intends to donate a large amount to the orphanage, the reluctant Jacob is convinced by the director Mrs. Shaw (Meenal Patel) that he must travel for the good of the children, and he promises to Pramod to be back on his birthday on the next week. Jacob has a meeting with the self-made tycoon that promises a donation of one million-dollar and is invited to go to the wedding of his daughter Anna Hannson (Stine Fischer Christensen) on the next day. In the wedding, Jacob sees Jørgen's wife Helene Hannson (Sidse Babett Knudsen), who had a past with him, and discovers a family secret that will affect his and the Hannson's lives.",/review/rw2735922/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2007,herjoch,10," another example of brilliant danish film-making!
","I greatly admired the previous films by Susanne Bier ("" Open Hearts"" and ""Brothers""), so my expectations were very high.Luckily they have been fulfilled.Like the other two the film is a sociological and emotional experiment.It's about one's place in the world (the crucial phrase in the film is Jorgen's ""Can one expect from you help only on the other side of the globe"" ), about responsibility and the making of painful decisions.The film starts quite slow,but after half an hour it's getting more intensive,mostly supported by 4 extraordinary actors and actresses.While I already knew the qualities of Mikkelsen,Knudsen and Lassgard,I was really blown away by Fischer Christensen as the daughter.There were 4 real-life characters and I could follow their psychological turmoil.Some may find the script too constructed,but life turns out to be full of unexpected twists.The film is no popcorn-entertainment,but for anyone,who appreciates a human,deeply moving drama with the concentration on the characters instead of superficial action,I can only say: Go and watch this movie!",/review/rw2735922/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2014,planktonrules,10," Wow...that's a kick in the head!
","Mads Mikkelson plays Jacob--a man who has spent much of his adult life working with orphans in India. However, his program relies on money from some benefactor back in his native Denmark. Inexplicably, this benefactor insists that Jacob come to Denmark personally to talk over future funding of the program. This really makes no sense, but Jacob has no choice but to go.",/review/rw2735922/?ref_=tt_urv

","""After the Wedding"" (2006) begins on the streets of Mumbai, India, where several orphaned, homeless children are queuing up for food, courtesy 'Anand Orphanage and School', assisted by Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen) who has taken up the cause. He teaches in the school attached to the orphanage, and is a favorite with the children there. The initial scenes make one wonder if this is yet another 'poverty porn' focusing only on the dirty underbelly of India and projecting it to be a country worse than it actually is (Think ""Slumdog Millionaire"").

25 March 2010,slimtoad20,10," Secrets Secrets are so much Fun
","Who said secrets aren't fun? Susanne Bier's After The Wedding reveals a deliciously profound and emotionally-impacting conundrum that draws the audience into the story early on. As a film technique, Bier's method of storytelling is effectively engaging. In fact, it's the director's ability to manipulate our emotions as viewers that makes this film so wonderfully unique. With the inclusion of a cross-cultural perspective not typically seen in Nordic film, After the Wedding is one of the more important films to emerge from Denmark in recent years.",/review/rw2735922/?ref_=tt_urv

","It seems incredible, but 'Susanne Bier' (qv) can apparently overdo herself every time! Just when I thought that 'Brødre (2004)' (qv) would simply be the peak of her career, she comes out with this masterpiece! Brilliant actors! Every role in this film is played out so well! Particularly 'Rolf Lassgård' (qv) does a fabulous job. The film has brilliant music, brilliant cinematography and a brilliant plot! Oh yeah, and ask me if it's touching! Please! I haven't been this moved since I saw 'I Am Sam (2001)' (qv), and that's saying something! 10/10 without hesitation. I simply can't put my finger on anything bad about this film. Just go see it, or you'll miss out on one of the finest moments in film history! Well done, Susanne! Bravo!",/review/rw2735922/?ref_=tt_urv

","Mads Mikkelson is dazzling as Jacob, a Bombay orphanage worker, in ""After the Wedding."" He's so good here I'd love to see him in a more complex film. Sidse Babett Knudsen is fetchingly pretty and natural as Helene, a rich man's trophy wife, though she isn't given much to do except be pretty, supportive, and an occasional sex object.

23 March 2007,writers_reign,8," Danish Blue
","It seems that France isn't the only country in Europe where female directors turn out classy movies. Susanne Bier, a new name to me, hits one out of the park with this Art House entry. It takes its time in getting where it's going and there are those who may find the top-and-tail Indian sequences superfluous and leading man Mads Mikkelsen - the heavy in Casino Royale - doesn't do expression, which means that if you don't dig The Great Stone Face you'll be disappointed but against this is some top-drawer thesping from the likes of Rolf Lassgard as a millionaire businessman, Sidste Babett Knudsen as his wife and Stine Fisher Christensen as their daughter. Mikkelsen is a transplanted Dane now living in India, running an orphanage and possibly atoning for a mis-spent youth on the side. A Danish philanthropist shows interest in making a bequest but for reasons best known as Plot #4a; Subsection 5, he has to go to Copenhagen and cosy up to the fairy godfather. Reluctantly he agrees and when he gets there it coincides with the wedding of the businessman's daughter, to which he is invited. You could have knocked me down with a fender (thanks to Dorothy Parker, from whom I stole that) when it turns out that the businessman's wife is Mikkelsen's ex-girl friend which makes her daughter ... well, I won't spoil it for you (and if you haven't guessed WHAT it makes her then I COULDN'T spoil it for you. From then on it's angst, tears, sturm, drang, the whole nine yards but it's also Class and Style.

","I am not a huge movie watcher, and I don't tend to fall in love with the films that I do see, but After the Wedding might be my favorite film of all time. It has everything necessary to draw an audience in: a slightly unbelievable (and unpredictable!) premise, family tragedy, scenes in India, and a great ending that left me in tears. While I thought everything about the film, including the acting, directing, and cinematography was phenomenal, what really makes this film stand out is the variety and depth of the relationships found between the characters.",/review/rw2735922/?ref_=tt_urv

8 April 2014,heistad-933-254808,8," Rolf Lassgård is phenomenal in this touching film about finding your family.
","Bombay. An orphanage, filled with rambunctious kids. The striking face of Denmark's biggest star, Mads Mikkelsen, is among the few adults. His character, Jacob, has been working in humanitarian efforts in India for the past twenty years but is in desperate need of funds from Denmark in order to prevent this orphanage from closing. Much to his disliking, he must return to his native country to secure the future for the beloved children. One of the orphan boys who Jacob considers family, Pramods, asks Jacob what the Denmark is like. He replies that he does not like the people because they are all rich. If he were rich, Pramods says, then he would be happy. The scene shifts suddenly to a man in his car listening to the American hit, ""It's Raining Men,"" instantly shifting in tone from humility and worry to one of confidence and security: he is carefree. We soon find out this man is Jogen (Rolf Lassgård), one of Denmark's wealthy businessmen. Jacob's idea of selfish and coldhearted rich people, however, is soon contradicted, as Jorgen reads goofy stories aloud to his sons and then playfully slides into his wife's bubble bath, fully clothed. He appears not to be a ruthless egomaniac, but a loving father and husband. When Jacob leaves for Denmark, he plans to be business partners with Jorgen, promising Pramods that he will be back in Bombay in time for his 8th birthday. Due to a few unexpected plot-twists, however, Jacob finds himself much more intertwined in Jorgen's life than he ever imagined.",/review/rw2735922/?ref_=tt_urv
