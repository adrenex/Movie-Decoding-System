3 May 2019,Hitchcoc,8," Harsh but True
","Several reviewers have criticized this movie as manipulative. If a director or a screenwriter's work causes an emotional reaction, can't any such movie be considered manipulative. If this had been a documentary, would you have embraced it because the facts would speak for themselves. It would seem that we should only have movies about sunshine and light when it comes to people who were born into poverty. We should have a happy ending but not show the sad facts leading up to it. I found the portrayal devastating. I found the performances to be outstanding, upsetting as they were. This is no movie for children or the faint of heart. Nevertheless, those who have the open-mindedness to look at the depth of this film should see it. Movies may have themes and ideas, but agendas? I'm not so sure.",/review/rw2269979/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2017,classicsoncall,8," ""I'll be okay, I guess, 'cause I'm looking up.""
","I find it ironic with a film directed and produced by Lee Daniels, with Oprah Winfrey on board as executive producer, that some reviewers on this board would consider the film racist. What it says to me is that any treatment of an historical event or a real life situation would be considered racist if the person watching is uncomfortable with it. That's always bugged me, because how are creative artists supposed to get their message across if they can't show the way people are and the ways they strive to better themselves?

15 September 2010,Matt_Layden,7," Life is hard. Life is short. Life is painful. Life is rich. Life is....Precious.
","This is a film that might make some people a little uneasy. It deals with family abuse in the form of rape, physical and verbal violence. The one character it follows is Precious, an overweight illiterate teenage girl who is pregnant with her second child from her biological father. She is kicked out of her school because of her pregnancy and is enrolled in another educational institution called each one teach one. She wants to do better things, but doesn't have the will or motivation because of the constant abuse at the hands of her mother. She day dreams about being a big star and getting out of the hellish life she lives.",/review/rw2269979/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2009,Monotreme02,6," Stunning performances but emotionally inconsistent
","I should start out by emphasizing that I disagree with much of the criticism the film has been receiving. A common disparagement condemns the movie as ""emotionally manipulative"" and ""superficially inspirational"", much like other films that fall into the category of the ""inspirational dramas"" depicting stories of individuals overcoming obstacles and hardships that many people seem to hate. Well, I personally found that the film portrays a reality far too bleak and dismal and brutal for it to possibly be considered ""inspirational""; in addition, while the film ends on somewhat of a high note, even that is laced with misery and becomes the lesser of two evils for the protagonist. Another criticism of the film – and of the book it is based on – is from the opposite end of the spectrum, and blames the film for portraying TOO bleak a situation to the point of exploitation. I personally found the scenario portrayed in the film to be strikingly realistic, and I think that people who are too ignorant to realize that such a grim existence can feasibly be led in 21st century America need a serious wake-up call.",/review/rw2269979/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2009,ccrivelli2005,9," Once every so often...
","Once every so often a film comes along that will change your perception of things. In one way or another it will give you elements to better yourself. ""Precious"" is such a film. Lee Daniels, the director, takes things to extremes, so much so that this could easily be an opera. When you think that things couldn't be worse, you discover that they have been worse already for a long time. Precious is played by a sort of miracle. Her name is Gubarey Sidibe and I don't even know how to pronounce it but I will certainly take her in my mind from now on, always. When she stands listening to the rantings of her mother, I surprised myself by feeling tears running down my face. The mother, a standout, once in a lifetime performance by Mo'Nique, is also a character we've never seen before. Brutal, unsentimental and truthful to the core. I saw the film over three weeks ago and I can't shake it out of my system, if that in itself is not a sign of greatness I don't know what is.",/review/rw2269979/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2010,jotix100,8," Abuse
","We were bowled over reading the original novel, ""Push"" by Sapphire, when it was first published. The story of Precious, a sexually abused young woman, from her own father, an individual that must have been a monster to even think of what he was doing to an innocent child, that went on for years, is nothing short of inhuman. That Precious was also the object of physical and verbal abuse from her own mother, was a double whammy. The fact that Precious father had the HIV virus and infected his own daughter is a despicable crime that no human being should ever have to face.",/review/rw2269979/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2009,mukava991,10," a work of art
","Gabourey Sibide looks and sounds a lot like the late Hattie McDaniel; if a biopic about McDaniel is ever made, Sibide should star. Starting from this superficiality, it is clear that the character Sibide plays, an abused, obese late- 20th-century Harlem teenager three or four generations down the line from the McDaniels era, seems to embody a sadly ironic regression in the status of black women in America. Precious's very existence and her debased environment speak to a grave social disease that continues to poison our civilization – the creation and perpetuation of a dependent underclass. At one point Precious compares her self image to ""black grease that needs to be wiped away."" The horror of it all is that as dreadful as Precious's situation is, she is actually better off than many others in similar straits. She is, despite obesity, strong and healthy, drug free and has a beautiful smile. There are plenty of underclass females much closer to an early grave and utter hopelessness than she.",/review/rw2269979/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2011,Arcturus1980,8," Among my favorites of the decade
",Precious is a film that doesn't mess around. The passion of director Lee Daniels and company resonates throughout the picture. There is no better example of casting. Geoffrey Fletcher and Mo'Nique couldn't be more deserving of their Oscars. The writing and acting make for an altogether captivating experience. Paula Patton's great as Ms. Rain. I've respected Mariah Carey's ability to crossover into acting since WiseGirls. Gabourey Sidibe is heaven-sent as Precious.,/review/rw2269979/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2010,sddavis63,6," A Truly Brutal, Emotionally Wrenching Movie
","SPOILER: First of all, thank God that this doesn't claim to be ""based on"" or ""inspired by"" a true story. That would be too much to take, because this is truly the most brutal movie I have ever seen - brutal not in quality but in content. As Precious deals with her mother's ongoing and relentless abuse (both physical and verbal) you find yourself almost in tears. As she has flashbacks to the sexual abuse she endured at the hands of her father you just need to turn your head away for a while and catch your breath. It's brutal. It doesn't claim to be based on a true story. You hope it's an exaggeration. You wish it doesn't happen. And, somehow, somewhere, deep within you know there are young kids enduring this type of abuse on a daily basis. So, the movie definitely gets an emotional reaction from the viewer, and deserves credit for that. But let's think about the content.",/review/rw2269979/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2009,EUyeshima,8," Powerhouse Performances Tower Over a Harrowing Yet Enthralling Tale of Redemption
","To my surprise, this soul-baring 2009 drama is neither as painful nor depressing as the subject matter would imply. In fact, director Lee Daniels' treatment alternates so fluently between gritty realism, social uplift, and fanciful episodes of fantasy that the end result is as much enthralling as it is emotionally draining. First-time screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher does a solid job adapting the 1996 source novel by Sapphire, ""Push"", but the strength and honesty of the cast is what sears in the memory. Daniels could have been otherwise charged with stunt casting had he not drawn out such powerhouse work from the out-of-left-field likes of comedienne Mo'Nique and pop diva Mariah Carey. Granted Daniels in his second directorial effort is not the most subtle of filmmakers (his first film was the strangely exotic ""Shadowboxer""), but he does bring a level of florid passion that the subject desperately needs to alleviate the unrelenting bleakness of the title character's existence.",/review/rw2269979/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2017,Screen_Blitz,9," Heartbreaking, yet triumphant tale of hope and sacrifice, with performances that are simply rewarding
","Some people are lucky and grow up in healthy, prosperous families with good jobs, good education, and a life filled with love. Then there are some who are not so lucky, living near of the bottom of the barrel with poor income and trudging through harrowing lifestyles with parents who have seemingly nothing but darkness in their heart. That is the basis of this heartbreaking, yet unusually uplifting drama directed by Lee Daniels. Following the story of an underage with a home style that can only be described as unpleasant and with an unfair future in sight, this film strikes at your heart with gruelingly powerful storytelling with strong emotional resonance. And Daniels accomplishes the story without diving into the pratfalls of emotionally contrived clichés. Part of this is thanks to the rewarding performances by Gabourey Sidibe, who is making her feature film debut, and Mo'Nique who is firing with a performance that simply cannot be ignored. Set in the poor neighborhood of Harlem in 1987, this film follows Clareece ""Precious"" Jones (played by Gabourey Sidibe), an overweight sixteen- year old girl who is pregnant with her second child after being raped by her father. She is attending school while living a poor home life with her extremely poor excuse of a mother Mary (played by Mon'Nique) who beats her, calls her horrible names, and yells at her to quit school because she is too ""dumb"". If that's not bad enough, she doesn't even have a job, she just collects welfare checks. When she is transferred to an alternative school and enrolls in an English class taught by Mrs. Rain (played by Paula Patton), she is opened to a glimmer of hope for her future. That is if she manage to balance being a mother and excelling in school, which she manages to ask advice for by her social worker Ms. Weiss (played by Mariah Carey). ",/review/rw2269979/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2010,evanston_dad,8," Effective But Strangely Abstract Representation of Hell on Earth for Some
","I found myself strangely unmoved by ""Precious,"" director Lee Daniels' breakout film about a young black woman with just about every conceivable card stacked against her who nevertheless finds the reserves within herself to go about forging a better life. I think my reaction has largely to do with the fact that I found Precious's life and the everyday horrors it contains -- horrors that include a physically, verbally and emotionally abusive mother; rape by her father resulting in two pregnancies; and by the time the film is over a diagnosis of HIV in a time when AIDS wasn't as successfully treated as it is now -- so momentous that they remained largely abstract. All of these horrors exist in the world, and I'm sure there are people who must deal with all of them at once, but the film presents them as a kind of pile-up derby of every bad thing that can happen to someone, and they all happen to our protagonist.",/review/rw2269979/?ref_=tt_urv

","Precious: Based on the Novel ""Push"" by Sapphire (2009): Dir: Lee Daniels / Cast: Gabourey Sidibe, Mo'Nique, Paula Patton, Mariah Carrey, Lenny Kravitz: An incredible film about the value of humanity. Sixteen year old Precious lives with her abusive mother and has just been suspended from school due to her second pregnancy from being raped by her mother's boyfriend. She tries again for education and along the way receives help. Directed by Lee Daniels in documentary fashion with excellent performances. Gabourey Sidibe stars as Precious who yearns to become more after being subdued by the harsh reality of abuse and neglect. Mo'Nique as her abusive lazy welfare mother steals scenes in her unpredictable vindictive manner. Her abuse knows no limits even in the presence of children. Paula Patton is superb as teacher Miss Rain whom takes a liking to Precious and encourages her to achieve beyond her background. She sets her up with a social worker, played by Mariah Carrey who steals scenes as she helps Precious face her past including a powerful face off with her mother. Lenny Kravitz plays a nurse who shows kindness and patience to Precious. It is a powerful must-see film about rising above tremendous odds and choosing to live life. In the case of Precious, she will allow her baby the opportunities she was denied. Score: 10 / 10",/review/rw2269979/?ref_=tt_urv

","FaNTASTIC FANTASTIC FANTASTIC! I was in awe over the storyline, acting directing, omg you name it. I had just learnt while typing this that Monique won best supporting actress. All I can say is of coarse she did you have to see her in this movie her performance is so cutting edge. Shout outs to Gabourey Sidibe who was brilliant as precious in this and wishful for her to receive the actress award as well. This movie is not for the weak hearted who are bothered by reality checks that so so many children are in abusive families like this. Lee Daniels offers a brutal yet realistic look into young Precious's life which as i said earlier is not a very nice life . A lot of reviews i have read on this film state that its over the top violent and unnecessary, why is it un necessary that people will may e see this film and then go back to their jobs within child services in some of the projects and pick up their game, or politicians for that matter?
