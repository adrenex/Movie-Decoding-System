2 August 2019,ferguson-6,8," Vengeance is thy name
","Greetings again from the darkness. With only her second feature film, Jennifer Kent (THE BABADOOK) has created a near cinematic masterpiece. The only thing holding it back is the historical subject matter and the no-holds-barred approach that will surely limit its audience. From an emotional aspect, the film is extraordinarily uncomfortable and disturbing to watch; however, from a filmmaking perspective, it's a thing of beauty. The two sides of my brain were at war the entire time.",/review/rw5096364/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2020,kosmasp,9," Not a sing a long
","After Babadook, you'd be excused to expect another horror movie. But this filmmaker has other plans. And what intriguing and complicated plans they are. The story is really interesting and it does keep it real. With all the ugly faces it brings up. I am not sure about the evil character being ""humanized"", but I get what she is trying to say there too.",/review/rw5096364/?ref_=tt_urv

12 March 2021,searchanddestroy-1,10," A true masterpiece.
","When I saw this feature I thought about BRIMSTONE, made five years ago, also a western starring a strong female character seeking vengeance in a bloodthirsty odyssey, a rampage into hell. Yes, I could not prevent myself to compare both movies, a kind of dive into madness and brutality. And so powerfully acted. That's a million times better than all those action packed thrillers starring female fighters, sort of NIKITA rip offs, all lousier one than the other. No, don't miss this one. You would regret it. A real hit in the face, in the guts. In the soul.",/review/rw5096364/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2021,lee_eisenberg,10," Australia has an ugly history
","Knowing that ""The Nightingale"" is from the director of ""The Babadook"" and seeing the poster, you might think that it's a horror movie. Well, the horror is the sheer cruelty of the British towards the Irish and Aborigines. Set in 1825 Tasmania, it focuses on an Irish woman working as a servant. After a British official murders her husband and baby, she enlists the help of an Aboriginal tracker to find the officer.",/review/rw5096364/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's 1825 present-day Tasmania. Clare is a young Irish convict forced to follow colonial British soldier Lieutenant Hawkins despite his brutality. She and her husband have a baby daughter. As convicts, they need to be released from service but Hawkins refuses to release the beauty. Hawkins has been stuck leading an outpost for the last three years and is desperate to get a promotion to Captain in a town a few days north. When he does not get the expected recommendation, the situation spirals into darkness.",/review/rw5096364/?ref_=tt_urv

2 June 2019,carrythe2,8," A tough but powerful and rewarding watch
","We were introduced to the film by one of the lead actors who advised us to ""strap ourselves in"", which I think was good advice. It does depict some horrific things done by humans to other humans, and a few people walked out of the screening in the first 10 minutes because by far the worst scenes are at the start.",/review/rw5096364/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2019,OlgaGorelik,10," Shocking violence. Heartbreaking aftermath. Beautiful love story. Powerful history lesson. All in one. Worth every tear.
","I want to start by saying that I did not find The Nightingale excessively violent. And believe me, I hate movie violence. But I feel like I've seen trailers for action flicks that had more. Plenty of TV shows do as well. Maybe not rape, but still. Perhaps the reason it didn't feel excessive was because the movie doesn't dwell on it. It avoids gore, except in a few places where it really was necessary. Not only is there absolutely nothing gratuitous, each of those scenes has in it so much more than just ""oh, look, they kill"", ""oh, look, they rape."" For example, both women who are raped are mothers. Both are torn away from their very young children in the process. So, not only are they brutally violated, I was horrified thinking what must have been going through their minds knowing that the children are out there, helpless, crying, and they can't protect them.",/review/rw5096364/?ref_=tt_urv

21 August 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8," The cruelty of colonialism.
","A stark examination of colonialism in 1800s Australia, Jennifer Kent's 'The Nightingale (2018)' envisions a brutal, realistic world that never seems to relent. Constantly subverting expectation in the most natural of ways, the film is a revenge odyssey that challenges the very concept it initially relies on. Through her Journey, Clare comes to realise things about herself and her country that she never once considered before. It's during this process that a bond begins to form with Aboriginal tracker, Billy, and empathy starts to emerge in an otherwise uncaring world. There's an incredibly real feel to the film, down to its very texture. Its violence, which is often shocking in its frankness, is never glamorised or, even, made especially cinematic, instead remaining as blunt and uncomfortable as the very environment it takes place in. Though it's bleak, the story still retains a tint of hope; its focus is on preserving empathy. That's the closest thing to a theme the feature has. It isn't concerned with traditional narrative payoff or pacing, really. That's what makes it so effective, though. It's a story about people and the things that they go through. It's difficult to describe, but everyone feels layered and down-to-earth enough to almost transcend their fictional status. The picture stares you straight in the face and presents its horrors wholesale. Its exploration of racism and violence against women is still sadly still relevant today. It's a powerful, unconventional and often uncomfortable experience unlike almost any other. It's well worth a watch if you can stomach it. 8/10",/review/rw5096364/?ref_=tt_urv

29 July 2020,lwmswm,5," Acting Great, Story Weak & Frustrating
","All of the actors did an excellent job. However, the strong Intelligent female protagonist slowly devolves into a headstrong weakling who makes such bad decisions that you no longer care about her or whether she accomplishes her revenge. After a strong set up giving her the motivation for seeking revenge (think Death Wish) this movie turned into a long drawn out chase that has everyone becoming stupid with each passing minute. When it finally culminates with a ""blah"" one minute ""revenge"" that could/should have occurred 45 minutes earlier I no longer cared.",/review/rw5096364/?ref_=tt_urv

7 August 2019,GManfred,," ****** Long Trudge
","Most of this film consists of an extended slog through the forests of Tasmania as our heroine tries to hunt down her tormentor, with the help of an aborigine tracker. I wanted to like this movie much more than I did, mainly because I despair of anything worthwhile from Hollywood and indies are the only hope. The actors strive admirably and give good performances but are handicapped by the sluggish pace and extended periods when nothing of import seems to happen.",/review/rw5096364/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2019,KensaoLightbringer,7," Not for everyone
","This revenge film is not for everyone, to say the least. The story is great, but the movie is extremely violent. The first 30 minutes of the film are hard to see, and for a lot of people, even hard to tolerate. One could argue that the director needed all this violence to properly portray the abuse against women that occurred at that time. A powerful experience, from which we do not emerge unscathed",/review/rw5096364/?ref_=tt_urv
