11 April 2010,Quinoa1984,7," better, or maybe just funnier, than expected thanks to the two leads and some supporting work
","The director Shawn Levy sadly doesn't inspire a lot of enthusiasm going into one of his movies. At best he's competent at what he does, and some years back made a halfway clever and original 'movie'-comedy (Big Fat Liar), but mostly has kept to Fox studio commercialism like Cheaper by the Dozen and the Night at the Museum movies. And yet, he (or just the studio) must have had the insight to put together two of the funniest people working right now- not to mention with shows back-to-back on Thursday nights on NBC- Steve Carrel and Tina Fey, because they help elevate anyone's work by a longshot. This isn't to say that Josh Klausner's script may not have some laughs, but where exactly I can't be sure, since most of his contributions would appear to come from the super-conventional story aspects (as my own mother put it, ""I don't know, looks like The Out of Towners, or that Blind Date movie from the 80's"").",/review/rw2533821/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. Most married couples can probably relate to the grind of a life absorbed with work and parenting. Sometimes the fantasy turns into having a quiet moment of solitude. Heck, even ""date night"" can devolve into just another responsibility tacked on at the end of a long week. This is the premise for director Shawn Levy's film. The best part? It doesn't matter at all.",/review/rw2533821/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2010,DICK STEEL,8," A Nutshell Review: Date Night
","I wonder how many married couples out there can attest to their lifestyle being nothing but revolving around work, family and especially kids, with the latter just sapping whatever free time they have in their waking hours, only to find themselves stuck in a wash-rinse-repeat cycle. The film examines in a comical fashion of course, the lifestyle of the typical family with working parents and young children, and how there isn't anything known as personal time, and having routine becoming the rot in their lives.",/review/rw2533821/?ref_=tt_urv

22 August 2010,claudio_carvalho,7," Funny and Entertaining
","The suburban tax lawyer Phil Foster (Steve Carell) and the real estate agent Claire Foster (Tina Fey) have a boring married life in New Jersey. In their routine, they have once a week the ""date night"", when they hire a baby-sitter for their children and they have dinner in the same restaurant. When their best friends decide to divorce because of their routine, Phil decides to surprise Claire and have dinner in the fancy restaurant Claw in Manhattan. However, they do not have reservation and is almost impossible to get a table; when Phil overhears the waitress calling Mr. and Mrs. Tripplehorn, he lies and gets their table. Sooner two men invite them to leave the restaurant with them and they believe the invitation is because they took the reservation of a couple that has not shown up. But they discover that the couple stole a flash memory from the powerful gangster Joe Miletto (Ray Liotta) and now they have a serious problem to resolve.",/review/rw2533821/?ref_=tt_urv

3 March 2011,MLDinTN,5," I thought it failed
","I was expecting better from Steve Carroll and Tina Fey, but for me, this movie just didn't deliver. There wasn't anything that made me laugh out loud. Some scenes were amusing. Carroll and Fey play a married couple that take the reservation of another couple at a fancy restaurant. It turns out the the other couple stole a flash drive from some gangster and he's hired two goons to get it back, and the goons happen to be cops. So, these cops take Carroll and Fey and threaten them. They escape and hunt down a friend played by Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg had the best scenes, as he stands there shirtless while everyone seems to make comments about it. The 2 track down the disk and want to return it. They are still being chased by the bad cops and the good cops and have to do a semi-stripper dance at the end.",/review/rw2533821/?ref_=tt_urv

12 April 2010,ScottDMenzel,8," ""Date Night"" is a real treat for Tina Fay and Steve Carell fans!
","Before I start talking about the movie itself, I would first like to point out that I am big fans of both of the stars involved with this film. Tina Fay is not only a beautiful woman but probably one of the funniest people in Hollywood. She is an amazing writer and I absolutely adore her show ""30 Rock."" As for Steve Carell, he is one of those actors who I really enjoy watching on the big screen and small screen. I have seen almost everything he has done from ""Little Miss Sunshine"" to ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and he has been really good at ""most"" of the roles he has played. With that being said when I saw the trailer for ""Date Night"" I was very excited to see what the end result of the film would be. So when the film finally opened in theaters, I made my journey to my local multiplex and treat myself to a ""Date Night."" ",/review/rw2533821/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2010,dvc5159,6," A very funny movie with plenty of laughs. Carell and Fey are in top form.
","I never was a fan of director Shawn Levy's films. Sure, ""Big Fat Liar"" and the 2006 version of ""The Pink Panther"" did get some memorable moments, but they weren't THAT re-watchable. A good, funny movie is something that you can remember for quite some time, and I had a hard time remembering something memorable from ""Cheaper By The Dozen"" and ""Just Married"". However Levy isn't a bad director, it's just that he needs one good funny movie to really hit it off. No, the two ""Night At The Museum"" movies don't count. This one does. ""Date Night"", thus far, is the best movie Levy's directed.",/review/rw2533821/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2013,lesleyharris30,7," Nothing Outstanding,But Fun and Very Enjoyable,
","Date Night is a good movie with a pretty well developed storyline that was in all honesty a lot more promising than the movie ended up,but its still very funny and action packed at times.The movies cast is fantastic and there are a lot of fun cameos throughout,the ones that really stick out in my head are Mark Wahlberg,James Franco,Mila Kunis,J.B. Smoove and Will i Am.I really like both Steve Carell and Tina Fey and thought the idea of them working together seemed like comedy gold,it certainly wasn't but the two of them still made for a fun movie.All in all,I would recommend Date Night to anyone looking for a short and sweet comedy to watch.",/review/rw2533821/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2010,mysteriesfan,2," Talented performers, woefully weak material
","I missed the Amy Poehler-Tina Fey movie of some years ago, so I did not want to miss what promised to be another dream team of comedy talents in Date Night. Maybe the mixed reviews of both films should have warned me. Still, the idea of droll, down-to-earth comedians Steve Carrell and Tina Fey in an action-adventure farce seemed inspired. Well, they were likable and tried to bring some wit and energy to the movie. But the material let them and the audience down badly.",/review/rw2533821/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2010,chaitov,2," Predictable & Boring.
","Steve Carrel & Tina Fey are great comics on TV. I found them stilted and so predictable in this movie that my mind started to wander and I kept looking at my watch during this very short film of only 88 minutes. The script was silly, more for a 12-13 year old, if at that. There were so many ridiculous plot twists that I just tuned out. It seemed so unrealistic although the plot itself was feasible. It could have been a very smart,witty movie, but stupidity was all around,in the dialogue,the strip bar scene,their dancing,and even the car chase. Luckily,I went on a Tuesday in Toronto when the movies are $6 all day so I didn't waste too much money. The part I enjoyed most were the outtakes at the end when the credits were rolling. It's best to wait until this boring movie is out on DVD.",/review/rw2533821/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2010,girvsjoint,5," Should have been better!
","'Date Night' is a bit of a disappointment, not so much because of the two stars, who try hard, and make the most of a pretty awful script! There are a couple of quite funny scenes, but sadly not enough to hold your attention for the entire 90 minutes. Slow to get going, the pace does pick up a little in the second half! A couple of UN necessary vomiting scenes could have been left out, never funny in my book. The camera work is excellent, and the film looks good visually, I'm more familiar with Steve Carrel's work than Tina Fey's, and they certainly both have the talent, but as with all performers, it all comes down to the script, and for me, this one just doesn't cut it, it's one of those films you want to work, but sadly, just misses the mark!",/review/rw2533821/?ref_=tt_urv

20 April 2010,JoeKarlosi,5," Date Night (2010) **
","Steve Carell and Tina Fey are a married couple with kids living in New Jersey who are lacking zest in their relationship. They have a boring ""Date Night"" lined up regularly every Friday, but even that is getting routine, and so hubby decides to spice things up by taking wifey out to dinner at an expensive Manhattan restaurant. When they arrive to find out that the place is booked up for the night they pretend to be another couple who didn't show up, so they can swipe their dinner reservation. But they are in for the mess of their lives when their meal is interrupted by a couple of crooked cops who mistake them for the other couple, who it turns out just happened to be in possession of something they wanted. This just wasn't a very funny or even interesting movie, and there's not much I can say about. It wasn't well written, and Steve Carell is pretty much doing the same old nerdy guy act he's tried in all his other movies. The best I can say for Tina Fey is that she looked deliciously slutty impersonating a whore late in the movie. ** out of ****",/review/rw2533821/?ref_=tt_urv

","Date Night (2010) is a movie I recently added to our DVD collection and watched for the first time in a long time with my wife. The storyline follows a couple that has decided to break from the standard date nights and head into the city and try something new. When they get their they discover not having reservations makes it impossible to get in anywhere...so they steal someone else's reservation. Unfortunately for them a case of mistaken identity finds them hunted down by both gangsters, corrupt police officers and the actual police...

11 April 2010,jordan2240,8," Consistently funny but contrived ending
","This was one of the funnier movies I've seen in a long time, and it was entertaining throughout. Unlike some comedies that show you all of the funny scenes in the trailers, this one saved some for the actual movie. The crowd in the theatre we were in certainly seemed to enjoy it. The two stars are equally amusing, and would probably make an excellent comedy duo should they decide to continue the partnership. The only thing I didn't particularly enjoy was the ending, as it was way overdone and silly compared to the rest of the film. I think they could have kept it in better context. But, the ending aside, I highly recommend ""Date Night"" for an entertaining outing. Perhaps it will even inspire you to let your hair down and steal someone's restaurant reservation. Who knows what might happen from there.",/review/rw2533821/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie has an identity crisis. It wants to be a comedy - only it's not funny. It wants to be an action film - only we need a little more of it to make it one. It wants to be a drama - but there's not enough heartfelt moments to sell us on the characters, or the drama.",/review/rw2533821/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2010,leiser18,5," Unrealistic at best
","If you haven't seen this movie, don't read this review! Date Night could have been very funny if the story would have been more realistic. Although the film has its funny moments, the plot is mostly unbelievable and stupid. There are some real flaws in this film: 1. The bad guys take Steve Carell's character's wallet. How is the couple getting around without any money? Tina Fey's character doesn't even carry a purse. A real woman doesn't go anywhere without a purse! 2. The couple is trying to escape the goons that are trying to kill them and their clothes get all messed up by falling down and climbing over a wall. In the next scene they both looked perfectly well groomed and clean. How did they manage that? 3. In the last scenes when the bad guys are being caught, Steve Carell's character has miraculously attached a wire and recording device to his body. When exactly did he set that up with the police without his wife knowing about it? They were never apart for a moment. Also, the scenes with the interlocked cars chasing through Manhattan are simply ridiculous. If anyone finds that funny, they must be 12 years old! I would have called the movie Much Ado About Nothing, but that would be an insult to Mr. Shakespeare.",/review/rw2533821/?ref_=tt_urv
