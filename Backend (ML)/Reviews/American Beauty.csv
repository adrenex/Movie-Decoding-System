",The absolute A-team of British actors can be found in this crime series which is based on historical events in the mid-80s. Quality pays off!,/review/rw8307388/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2022,irnbru-333,8," British drama at its very best - do not miss it
",Inspired by real events this timely new drama series is set in present day Nottinghamshire where a murder seemingly has links to the miners strike of 1984 and the divisions in the local community it provoked.,/review/rw8307388/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2022,rnf100,8," Absolute class
",BBC drama at its brilliant best. A stellar cast of top notch actors and a story line that always keeps you guessing with some real jaw dropping moments. This is definitely one of the best series of the year. Not to be missed.,/review/rw8307388/?ref_=tt_urv

14 June 2022,the_venetian,10," A compelling start
","With one of the greatest TV casts put together since State of Play, this series promised to be interesting. But the first episode has surpassed my hopes -- the essential background to this drama is brilliantly sketched as we are introduced to the large range of characters, and it is beautifully written, shot and performed. It was so gripping I watched it twice, not wanting to let it go, and counting down the hours to tomorrow night. If it is half as good, the week between episodes 2 and 3 will seem an eternity.",/review/rw8307388/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2022,antide-42376,8," Good
",A lot of dramas fizzle out after a few episodes but that is not the case with 'Sherwood'. Every episode is worth watching and as a drama overall this works. Well acted and with a good story this is one of the best and most consistent dramas the the BBC has produced for a while.,/review/rw8307388/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2022,stairways,5," Really promising start, downhill thereafter
","The background to this show is fascinating and, mostly, handled well,. The notorious miners' strikes of 1984 in Britain, and the way they polarised and divided the mining communities themselves, and all of Britain, has left a black stain on British society, and particularly on the Metropolitan police force who used a very heavy hand against the striking miners.",/review/rw8307388/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,jpolywog,10," Gripping
",How refreshing to see so many top British actors coming together in this superbly written TV drama. I spent the first 2 episodes spotting some of the British greats. This has to be up there with the best of British drama. Can't wait for episode 3..Keep them coming.,/review/rw8307388/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2022,julianrosser-440-787839,8," Superb drama
","A gripping series from beginning to end and even more powerful for being based on actual events. Outstanding cast and direction, superb location filming and a poignant reminder of a terrible time in British history.",/review/rw8307388/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2022,richardkiddle,6," Great start,fizzles out.
","With such a great cast this should have been brilliant viewing. Indeed the first two episodes were dynamite & I was hooked. But then a tedious sub-plot about a police officer turned spy derails the show. I really couldn't have cared less who ""Keats"" was and the ""big reveal"" fell flat. One of the killers motives seemed random & not well explained & the show went out with a whimper not a bang.",/review/rw8307388/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,charliebutler-66875,6," Fantastic cast, boring drama
","Hearing reviews comparing Sherwood to Happy Valley and Broadchurch, I had high expectations that sadly the show could not reach. What started out as a fairly interesting whodunnit devolved into a confused and, worst of all, boring slog.",/review/rw8307388/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2022,grahamf-55542,4," Fi and Jane, you should know better....
","I was ready to dismiss this after E1. At first, it seemed like a serious drama but by the end of that first episode it was running into problems, and the arrows in Sherwood Forest pushed it into the realms of ridiculous.",/review/rw8307388/?ref_=tt_urv

",Don't waste your time if you like a decent conclusion!,/review/rw8307388/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2022,orkneyislander,3," Nah...
",Started off ok but deteriorated rapidly after episode four. Too many plot holes and implausable scenarios. And how come hundreds of police plus helicopters that would have used heat detecting apparatus cannot locate one man in an isolated woods. Let alone cordon off the boundary roads that he rode off on complete with bow and arrows on his back. Took on a decided 'soapy' feel towards the end. The constantly antagonistic attitudes of all the characters didn't make for empathy. Disappointing.,/review/rw8307388/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2022,praestandum,4," Started well then collapsed
","This started very well and lasted two episodes. It just collapsed after that, utter dribble. The final episode was just pure torture. I can only say don't waste your time. It's not worth it,",/review/rw8307388/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2022,phynesse72,3," Strong start, weak finish
","First three episodes were interesting and gripping drama then it all imploded into a contrived mess. As others have mentioned plot holes, loose ends that were never explained resulted in a very unsatisfying ending. I found myself frequently fast forwarding through the last 3 episodes.",/review/rw8307388/?ref_=tt_urv

",Contains offensive language throughout.,/review/rw8307388/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,Bilse85,6," Could be better
","I was really excited about this series. The cast alone was reason enough to watch it and they didn't disappoint. However, there are problems which are hard to ignore. First of all, although this is an interesting and poignant subject, I felt that the events described were a little bit forced. The beginning title gives us the information that the author was inspired by two murders in his home town. As I continued to watch the series I came to the conclusion that these murders were not enough to plot a whole six episode mystery. The fact that the mystery was not at all mysterious was not helping the matters. In the end, the conclusion of the only thing we the viewers were really curious about was handled badly and that left a bitter taste. My second reservation is about the tone. I can't possibly fault the acting of these finest of actors but the way the scenario is written was sometimes too didactic. I never mind a bit of a history lesson in fiction and I am glad that I got to learn about these events through this series but some lines spoken in some situations sounded unrealistic, at least to me. I can see what the writer was trying to achieve but they should have trusted the wonderful cast to convey their message. Lesley Manville needn't say a word to tell a thousand pages, she can just do that by giving us a look. Same with David Morrissey.",/review/rw8307388/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2022,bockingrg,3," Started Well
",Episode 2 had me hooked thought it was going to be really good but personally rubbish I would not recommend it the story could have been done in 4 episodes or less disappointed very disappointed.,/review/rw8307388/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2022,szweda-18555,2," Not worth the licence fee
","Was not going to waste any more of my time on this 6 hour dubiously plotted wander around the woods of Notts... Suffice to say I found it confusing, irritating, plodding and basically worthless... dead-ends, red herrings, jobbing acting, token trope players drifting around some place or other at the end of the line... and now they say there is a second series! Err, how? Maybe that explains the inexplicably dull shudder to a halt... another broken train... maybe time to shunt this heap of rusted nonsense off down some siding and actually commission something worth our licence fee please BBC. And to think I used to watch the station every day... now it is just a couple of times a month if that. Do yourself a favour get outside and make some good memories instead of 6 hours lost to this dross.",/review/rw8307388/?ref_=tt_urv

5 July 2022,lululul,1," great actors though but lazy writing sheer drivel
","It starts off with great actors and not too woke, so you do get involved, it is slow and that is always suspect because it usually means they are dragging it out and they did, the writing is awfully lazy, real drivel from episode 4 on, they could have shown more of how those infiltrators got vetted, it is all old school conspiracy, and all of us the sheople are their puppets. And they always forget to show how 'they', (mr global lol) need new blood, how they recruit and stuff, you only see the established ones, all following orders because that is what we all do, sigh.",/review/rw8307388/?ref_=tt_urv
