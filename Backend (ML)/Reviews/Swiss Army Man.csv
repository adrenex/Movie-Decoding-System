","First off, any movie that opens with a song by King Crimson should get our attention. MANDY is a hallucinatory, revenge / horror film set in the early 1980's. Red Miller (Nicolas Cage) is on a mission of bloody vengeance after a cult full of psychopaths does the unspeakable to the title character (Andrea Riseborough).",/review/rw5376400/?ref_=tt_urv

","I really enjoyed this film. Honestly, I'm really close to saying that I loved it. This movie is wonderfully inventive, beautifully shot, and totally unlike anything else I've ever seen before. Plus, you get to see Nick Cage fight with chainsaws. What's not to like?",/review/rw5376400/?ref_=tt_urv

31 October 2018,Bertaut,7," Entertainingly insane
","Equal parts psychotropic horror and grindhouse revenge thriller, Mandy is what you might get if David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick, and Andrei Tarkovsky teamed up to remake Death Wish (1974) in the style of a Giallo. The second feature from director and co-writer Panos Cosmatos, after the interesting, but not entirely convincing Beyond the Black Rainbow (2010), Mandy is a psychedelic experience in pretty much every way, and as midnight-y as a midnight B-movie could possibly be. And although it would be impossible to recommend to everyone, there is an undeniable brilliance here. An insane brilliance. But a brilliance none-the-less. Although it could (somewhat legitimately) be accused of too much style and not enough substance, Cosmatos pitch-perfectly mixes an expressionist aesthetic with horror tropes, a generic revenge narrative, and comedy beats. But let's face it, the reason most people will see the film is for Nicolas Cage, and in that sense, Mandy joins the ranks of films such as Vampire's Kiss (1988), The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans (2009), and Mom and Dad (2017) in giving Cage an organic, narratively justified reason to go full-Cage, digging deep into his reservoir of utter insanity. And that's never a bad thing.",/review/rw5376400/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2019,Tweekums,9," A brilliantly bonkers trippy revenge horror
","Red Miller and his girlfriend Mandy Bloom have a peaceful life in America's Pacific Northwest until a strange cult arrives in the area. Mandy catches the eye of the cults Mansonesque leader, Jeremiah, and he has her and Red kidnapped by the Black Skulls; a biker gang on acid with a penchant for human blood! Needless to say bad things happen. Red is left by their tormentors and the next day he sets off on his personal mission of revenge. This will involve a crossbow, battle axe and a chainsaw fight before he ultimately faces Jeremiah again.",/review/rw5376400/?ref_=tt_urv

","Nicolas Cage is very well known for going all out. There are memes out there depicting this. And you would be excused for thinking he is like that in real life. But if you watch his interviews you realize he is different. Soft spoken and so different from what he portrays. Seems like he gets it out of his system, when he plays those characters.",/review/rw5376400/?ref_=tt_urv

","This really is not for everyone and that is just fine.
Also story wasnt anything new or special, just typical revenge story.
Really liked how this looked, sounded and felt.
Visuals and colours are just outstanding and that was something that hooked me from the start, really trippy stuff in a good way.
Music and sounds were pushing this dark overall sinister feel and worked perfectly.
And also Nick have us great performance near insanity.",/review/rw5376400/?ref_=tt_urv

",This movie is an absolute trip and people complain about style over substance but that's the whole point of the movie. To give us an insane heavy metal LSD horror trip for 2 hours. It suceeds in every way. Nic Cage is goofy in this movie and it is perfect. Some of his expressions are golden.,/review/rw5376400/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2018,MrDHWong,7," A hypnotic fever dream of nightmarish proportions propelled by a reliably crazy performance from Nicolas Cage
","Mandy is an action horror film co-written and directed by Panos Cosmatos. Starring Nicolas Cage and Andrea Riseborough, it is a hypnotic fever dream of nightmarish proportions propelled by a reliably crazy performance from Cage.",/review/rw5376400/?ref_=tt_urv

","Mandy is one hell of a piece of exquisite filmmaking. Combining arthouse with grindhouse has never come together quite as flawlessly as it does in this film. I couldn't help but immediately think Tarantino upon seeing the opening credits and as it progresses, the parallels are definitely there. That's not to say that this is a knockoff, quite the contrary, I think most filmmakers take cues from others and if Tarantino's work is one of Panos Cosmatos' inspirations, I welcome it. Also thrown in are some Charles Manson vibes, a subtle sense of humor, a killer, rock 'n' roll soundtrack and a touch of the supernatural, packaging it all up nicely. Not to mention Nic Cage, I mean, wow! With the exception of Leaving Las Vegas, I've never considered myself a huge fan due to his mediocre acting abilities and slew of less than satisfactory films, but damn if the part of Red wasn't written just for him. This is probably his best performance to date and I've gained a new respect for him that I hope to nurture further. In conclusion, when I first heard about Mandy several months back, I knew I would love it and I was more than right. It's definitely not for everyone due to its subject matter and elevated level of gory violence but even the most hardened critics, or softest hearts, should at least be able to appreciate its vision, artistically and otherwise.",/review/rw5376400/?ref_=tt_urv

","Fun to c Nic Cage snort some coke n his wide eyeballs.
Nic Cage acted damn well n the film is good too.
It is slow paced but there is something hypnotic about it n Cage Rage is back.
U don't get bore. There is a surrealistic feel to it.
The colour palette n the location added to the dark nature of the film.
My only crib is the headache inducing flickering lights n some action scenes shot in the dark.",/review/rw5376400/?ref_=tt_urv

","Yes this film confirms what I have always said. Nicolas Cage is a very good, and gifted actor, one among the best of his generation, but unfortunately with big, major money issues, debts or alimony...So that put s him in a position where he has to work, work, all year long, five movies per year, anything but work, work, work, to feed his bank account, no matter the quality...;Such a shame; He can not afford to choose the best part for him....But YES, YES, YEs he is a wonderful actor. This film proves it. rememeber him in PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED, LEAVING LAS VEGAS, where he was outstanding in a role very close to Ray Milland in LOST WEEK END, JOE....What a shame for such a waste of talent.",/review/rw5376400/?ref_=tt_urv

",'Mandy' is like 'The Devil's Rejects' meets 'I Spit on Your Grave' meets... a film I have yet to see. With that said it is also one of the most unique films I've ever seen. Clear? When the credits began to roll I was left with a feeling of what the hell did I just watch?
