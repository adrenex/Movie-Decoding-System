19 December 2019,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," Perfect casting!
","I'm not a real fan of slow paced long movies... unless they are made by Mr. Eastwood. He captures every tense moment, facial expression, or still scene, and manages to fill in more about the story he is telling. Casting was perfection! Paul Walter Hauser needs awards for his performance. Kathy Bates and Olivia Wilde were on point, as was Sam Rockwell and Canadian wannabe Jon Hamm - who is awesome in his TV commercials lol! Directing was perfect, cinematography great, score in line, and the writing was good. Very enjoyable film and I recommend it. It's a well deserved 9/10 from me",/review/rw5333558/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie is a great wake up call about the media. I wasn't going to leave a review until I read the media outcry about the film. I believe in a strong and free media but for all the good can they do, they can also be a self-serving destructive force.",/review/rw5333558/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2019,thebricks,10," Excellent portrayal of the sleaziness of law enforcement
","I have experience dealing with the Feds and found this movie incredibly compelling. So much about this movie hit home for me. Just a few examples, when the Feds came to talk to Jewell and tried to make him sign shady documents, bugging his home, the slick self-righteous agent who thinks he decides who is right and wrong, cleaning out his home supposedly looking for evidence, wasting time on easy, harmless suspects instead of finding the real criminals to boost their career. It's sad. All that time spent looking at Richard Jewell as a suspect while the real terrorist got away. They knew he was innocent, all they had to do was actually do some actual investigative, science-based investigative work instead of using confirmation bias.",/review/rw5333558/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2019,flicklover,10," Thank you Clint Eastwood!
","I just came back from a prescreening of this film and just had to comment. It is a very timely and comes in a time in our country where the media picks who they want to deify and who they want to destroy without caring about who they hurt. Clint Eastwood has created an eloquent, but searing critique on our media dominated society. He isn't Oliver Stone that comes with outrageous conspiracies and makes everyone a villain. The film says that we are forgetting that in this country your are innocent until PROVEN guilty not the other way around.",/review/rw5333558/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2019,courtjes,," Upsetting but excellent.
","Even as a former prosecutor I would have liked to arrest the FBI and media people who ruined Richard Jewell's reputation, life.I wish at the end the movie clarified how he won some settlements against the offending newspaper and others. Clint Eastwood is truly amazing as an actor and a director.",/review/rw5333558/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2019,paul-allaer,8," Watch a man get mauled by overzealous FBI and frantic media
","""Richard Jewell"" (2019 release; 125 min.) brings the story of the suspected 1996 Atlanta bomber. As the movie opens, it is ""1986 Atlanta"" and Jewell is working as a supply room manager in a small law firm. He gets to know one of the lawyers,, Watson Bryant. We then go to ""1996 Piedmont College"" where Jewell is working as a security officer but he really sees himself as a law enforcer. Eventually, just months before the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, he is fired by Piedmont's President... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw5333558/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2019,JackCowart34,9," Great Movie Fueled by Great Performances
","The fact that this is based off of a true story makes it all the more emotionally impactful. A man and a hero's life is ripped apart by the media for no apparent reason other than to try and pin a heinous crime on the most convenient person. Seems to be the story of our time. All of the performances in this movie did the real life people this was based off of justice. Paul Walter Hauser was stunningly brilliant as Richard Jewell and elicited about as much sympathy as someone can on the big screen. Kathy Bates also delivered in spades as the emotional mother having to watch her son be wrongly accused by the United States government and the media. It's not often you have three stand out performances in one movie, but Sam Rockwell deserves some recognition too for the great work he did as Richard Jewell's lawyer and close friend. This was a story that holds a heavy message for this day and time, and Clint Eastwood portrays it in a way that is sure to stick with the viewers for a long time.",/review/rw5333558/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2020,boblipton,10," Life Is Complicated
","On July 27, 1996, during the Atlanta Olympics, a pipe bomb went off at the game site, killing one and injuring 111 others. The toll might have been much higher, had not a security guard, Richard Jewell, noticed a suspicious-looking package, alerted the police, and helped them partially evacuate the area. He was immediately proclaimed a hero, and sought out for interviews on television. A few days later, information was leaked that the FBI was investigating him as the bomber, and the media frenzy over his accused villainy grew wilder than before.",/review/rw5333558/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2019,blanbrn,9," Well done with detail a look at an unsung and common hero with courage who faced doubt!
","Clint Eastwood has once again done it as a director as he brings drama and emotion to the big screen so well. As this time with this drama type biography picture ""Richard Jewell"" which is based on the life and real events of the 1996 Olympic games bombing in Atlanta, GA which involved Richard who first was a life saving hero only to later be looked at upon by the media and government as a possible suspect.",/review/rw5333558/?ref_=tt_urv

","Eastwood has done it again, adding yet another wonderful film to what is a beyond legendary filmography. Based on the real-life story of a heroic security guard turned villain during the '66 Centennial Olympic Park bombing, we see the horrifying extent to which the media can vilify an individual, especially one as kind-hearted as Richard Jewell. So many incredible performances but ",/review/rw5333558/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. Imagine you are being falsely accused of a terrorist act that killed and injured people. You are the FBI's primary suspect. Your name and face are spread across every possible media outlet. Your belongings have been searched and seized as evidence - right down to your mom's Tupperware. Cameras follow your every step of every day. Now imagine all of this occurs mere days after your actions actually saved lives and you were hailed as a hero across all of those same media outlets. Richard Jewell didn't have to imagine this, as he lived this nightmare in 1996.",/review/rw5333558/?ref_=tt_urv

","What if someone decided you were guilty of a horrible crime? What if the news said you were guilty and your friends, neighbors and co-workers believed it? What if the police tried to bully you into a confession when you were completely innocent the whole time? This is the true story of Richard Jewell, an innocent man who was cancelled by the media long before cancel culture existed. Excellent acting by Paul Walter Hauser and Kathy Bates and of course directed masterfully by Clint Eastwood. If you're not frightened by this movie - you're not paying attention.",/review/rw5333558/?ref_=tt_urv

","Clint Eastwood directed such a glorious piece of drama, a remarkable experience all the way through. Paul Walter Hauser, Kathy Bates, and Sam Rockwell did so great.

15 December 2019,frank4122,10," Best Movie In A Generation
","I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE! We are all Richard Jewell. When a once storied agency can abuse it's power and take away all due process rights afforded in the Constitution, we all in grave danger. I once thought that the corruption in the FBI was limited to a few corrupt execs at the top, Jewell proves that is not the case. The program I work in is being scrapped and rebuilt as it is not very efficient. The FBI is not only totally inefficient, they are actively working to frame the innocent and destroy people's lives. FBI has lost all credibility. They knew that the entrapment they set up against an uncouth Jewell would make him a perfect patsy. The FBI had no concern of finding the actual bomb maker, they put all their energy to violating due process rights, and continued to harass a hero when they knew they he was innocent. The FBI needs to be scraped and rebuilt as an investigative agency that protects, serves and follows the Constitution.",/review/rw5333558/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2020,classicsoncall,8," ""They're all after me now.""
","I haven't been this ticked off by a movie in a long time. Well, not the movie so much as the treatment received by Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) from the FBI and an overzealous media. I'll never understand the quick rush to judgment on the part of authorities to condemn a suspect at the expense of finding out the truth. To be sure, Jewell didn't do himself any favors by being as forthcoming as he was; those scenes where he offered information to the agents raiding his home with mother and attorney present were frustrating as hell. You got the feeling he was his own worst enemy.",/review/rw5333558/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2019,wobblybike,9," Saw it, loved it.
","I always wonder why some directors make crap movies and others make great movies. Clint Eastwood has one of the greatest portfolios of smart, intelligent, interesting and well acted films. From humble beginnings as an actor he has developed into an iconic director. You know going into the theatre that your going to see an artist at work. This story, this movie is what careers are made off. Go see it.",/review/rw5333558/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2021,searchanddestroy-1,9," Is there a candidate to become another Richard Jewell?
","The most important thing I have heard in this film is the question that Jewell asks to the FBI goons who put him nearly under arrest: After all this, who would dare to declare a bomb seen among a crowd, WHO would be dumb enough to save people, to prevent a massacre, with the threat to be accused for having put the bomb, just for being a celebrity? "" These are not the exact words, but the meaning is just this. And it is obviously logic and fair to ask this relevant question. I admit that the possibility exists that a person puts a bomb and then declares to have found a bomb, just for being a hero. yes, definitely yes, that possibility exists, nothing is impossible in this world - see 11/9.... - but it is highly improbable. Me, after viewing this film, if I saw a suspect package in the subway, I would ran away and that's all. And no one could accuse me afterwards to have seen it and run away. No one. If there is no bomb, the question is not even conceivable. And if the bomb explodes, there will be no more witness to testify against the coward. Unlike no assisting a person attacked of collapsing on the sidewalk. You can be sued for this, and that's a damn good thing. How can you prove that someone saw a package or not under a subway or bus seat? Now back to this film, as usual with Eastwood, this is a pure...Jewell. Convincing at one hundred percent, in a country where everyone speaks to you with your first name, but is ready to tear you into pieces, to shred you, FOR ANY REASON at all. Eastwood is definitely a far better director than actor. As a film maker he has given us so many proofs of his skills, so many, for such a prolific and gifted movie magician. His features have something special, that many others have not.",/review/rw5333558/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Richard Jewel"" is another Clint Eastwood masterpiece. It is a factual portrayal of the Centennial Park bombing in Atlanta during the 1996 Olympics, that is timed just right for our political environment today. The movie never goes over the top.

","Full of worthy performances, infuriatingly poignant plot points, and sleek direction from Clint Eastwood, Richard Jewell is one of the best films of the year (and probably the best Eastwood film since (maybe) Mystic River?) and should be getting more recognition because of it. A heartbreaking story about a man whose life was ruined because of false reports and accusations of his involvement in the 1996 Olympic bombing. It's terrifyingly real when it needs to be, incredibly devastating when it should be, and even funny when it can be. Controversy aside, this film is fantastic.",/review/rw5333558/?ref_=tt_urv
