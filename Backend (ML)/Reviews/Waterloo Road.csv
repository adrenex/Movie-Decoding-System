29 December 2019,MOscarbradley,8," A serial killer movie like no other.
","You know that a Lars von Trier serial killer movie is unlikely to be like anyone else's serial killer movie; that it is most likely to be more gruesome and perhaps even with a streak of very black humour and ""The House that Jack Built"" certainly doesn't disappoint. What we might not have guessed was that it would take the form of a dialogue between our serial killer, Jack, (a never better Matt Dillon), and some Stygian boatman who is probably rowing him all the way to Hades, (Bruno Ganz. perfectly cast).",/review/rw4574431/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have a proposal for those who have not yet seen 'The House That Jack Built', Lars von Trier's latest film (2018). Try to forget who the director is. I know it's not easy, because we are dealing with a person and a personality who provokes and shocks, who seeks and attracts scandals and who knows that advertising is best when it's bad. My opinion, after watching this film to which the 2018 Cannes Film Festival scheduled only a premiere out of competition, is that the attitudes and reactions triggered by this film are much more extreme than the film itself. It is a dissection and a psychological analysis of a serial killer, developed with effusion over two and a half hours of screening, but I did not find in this film anything that would shock me more than what I experienced for example at the screenings of 'The Silence of the Lambs' or 'Zodiac' and the graphic visual details do not exceed what we saw in the countless films in the series 'Scream', 'Halloween' or 'Elm Street', not to mention the violent and psychological intensity of the films of Tarantino, Lanthimos or von Trier himself. Whoever manages to separate this film from the advertising shell of the image that the director is trying to build to himself will have many reasons for cinematic satisfaction.",/review/rw4574431/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2020,Draysan-Jennings,7," Trippy horror film
","This movie was definitely a roller coaster. Some very intense scenes and some very slow ones. For the most part, I enjoyed the film. I will say it was different from your average horror flick. The camera work reminded me of something you'd see in a docudrama. Matt Dillon was great in this. Based on his performance alone you should give this film a shot. I've been reading a lot of criticism towards the director. I guess I'll have to watch some of his older work. 7 stars.",/review/rw4574431/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2019,christopher-underwood,10," I am a convert
","Fabulous and remarkable film that grabs a hold of the viewer from the very start. Even though this breaks my own little 'Dogma' rules in that a film of over two hours repetition and numbered scenes should be avoided, Lars von Trier asserts his authority and as far as I am concerned holds attention and (unbelievably!) belief until the wondrous and spectacular Dante inspired ending. The performance of Matt Dillon is crucial and his opening scene with Uma Thurman vital to the film's success. As it happens the scene is utter perfection and the varied and mounting degrees of humour, frustration, anger and retribution are all present and ensure that the attentive viewer is sucked in. Brilliant film making and although I have tended to ignore the director in recent years because of length, I am a convert.",/review/rw4574431/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2020,Samyang,8," Be afraid to get scared.
","I'm not a fan of von Trier to begin with. But this movie just got in to my mind really bad. Couldn't stop thinking about it. Was it good, was it bad, if I admit I liked it does that make me half insane? It's a movie that doesn't let go of it's viewers, even though they walk away. I had to pause several times, not because of its length but because the cruelty and sickening things and the anticipation of what was going to happen. But I always came back. I had to see what was coming.. Those ambivalent feelings stuck so hard.. Oh boy. Both disgusted and fascinated. I have to admit that I know feel like a horrible person for liking the movie. It was somewhat pretentious, but imo quite better done than Lynch.",/review/rw4574431/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2018,TheVictoriousV,4," When you're so unique it becomes boring.
","Does anyone else miss pre-depression era Lars von Trier? I still give him Antichrist and even Melancholia, but the ""just because"" stylistic choices of the tedious Nymphomaniac made me yearn for a time when he had enough thought behind his unconventionality to give us his wonderful Dancer in the Dark, and enough humor to give us Riget. He was always nasty, defiant, and upsetting like only he knows how, but something has changed.",/review/rw4574431/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2018,Impatotec,8," Lars von Trier's autobiography and a narcissistic statement about art...
","As a long time von Trier fan, I believe it's pretty obvious he made this film primarily for himself, and secondly for the dogmatic fans of his own work. Sure, on the surface it is a sort of a black psychological (divine, *wink, wink*) comedy, as some of his previous films can, as well, be seen. However, there is a layer beyond the physical, even more so the psychological aspect of what is portrayed.",/review/rw4574431/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2019,tomgillespie2002,4," A stand-in for von Trier's self-satisfied smirk
","Seven years ago, Danish provocateur Lars von Trier found himself banned from the Cannes Film Festival after making a rather ill-timed joke about sympathising with Hitler during a press conference for Melancholia. For a festival that seems to inspire walk-outs and boos from audiences who have apparently never seen a film before, it was never going to be too long until von Trier wriggled his way back in. After all, for a director famous for clitoris-removal and the mocking of disabled people, the lure of free advertising from appalled cinema-goers would surely be too strong to resist. For his return, von Trier brought The House That Jack Built, a two and half hour serial killer movie that often feels like a stand-in for the director's self-satisfied smirk. Not only does the film feature animal cruelty, infanticide and open mocking of the #MeToo movement, but the anti-hero at its centre talks frequently at length about his real obsession. You guessed it: the Third Reich. This is a giant middle-finger to the Cannes board.",/review/rw4574431/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2018,kaptenvideo-89875,7," Be afraid! The bad boy of European movie industry, Von Trier is back in movie theatres after 5 year hiatus.

7 May 2019,kosmasp,9," You don't know Jack
","But that's what this movie is for, right? It is about getting to know Jack and what this abysmal person is about. How he became who he is. Calling him an anti-hero would not really cover it. A powerhouse performance from Dillon and all the other actors involved who mostly are sub-stories themselves. It will be difficult to watch for sure and that is not just because this has a lot of vivid violence included (or at least the aftermath of it), but because of the nature of the movie and the evil core of the main character.",/review/rw4574431/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2018,mageh,4," trying to be as art as it can be
","It felt like LVT was trying to create this edgy provocative art work that will address interesting subject: why people kill, what is going through their mind, how serial killer becomes serial killer, etc. However, LVT is no psychologist, he lacks the background on the subject and eventually it feels like art person is trying to give his person opinion why certain people think/behave this way.
It is kind of interesting visually, like a weird painting, however it lacks depth. It felt pretentious but didn't provoke any thoughts for further discussion. The violence in the movie was trying to create a shock that will be thoughts provoking, unfortunately it didn't, it fell flat and even silly. Although LVT did some other very unique unforgettable movies, this one is not recommended.",/review/rw4574431/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2019,deloudelouvain,8," Lars von Trier, a name you'll never forget, for better and for worse.
","Since watching Antichrist from 2009 I pledged I would never watch a Lars von Trier movie again, that's how much I absolutely hated that movie. But after years passing by you forget about that pledge and so I tried The House That Jack Built. You can say what you want about Lars von Trier but his movies are very controversial. He has an unique way to bring a story and for that you have to give him credits. The House That Jack Built is again a very special movie, but this time the story was interesting, not like Antichrist that I found utterly boring. This time you have again shocking moments but since the story was captivating they kinda fitted well in the movie. Matt Dillon did a great job playing Jack the serial killer, definitely one of his best acting. The whole movie is about this character and the rest of the cast, even though they did a good job, are just screen filling. The end was very what you can expect from Lars von Trier, a bit chaotic and maybe not the best solution, but this time his movie worked, at least for me. Visually it's all perfect, the story and acting were good, the strangeness a typical signature for a Lars von Trier movie.",/review/rw4574431/?ref_=tt_urv

28 July 2020,jamericanbeauty,10," Uncomfortable and Ugly...I'm in love.
","It's disgusting. I felt uneasy the whole time. I wanted to stop watching. I couldn't. I am in love with this movie. It was gory, gorgeous artwork or a portrait of an unapologetic serial killer and his kills. It's also educational, as it walks you through history, poetry, music, engineering principles, architecture, the afterlife and the myth of toxic masculinity (As a woman, I've been victimized by women, personally and professionally. No gender owns toxic. Anyone can be toxic). Days later, I can't stop thinking about this movie. It should be a crime that Matt Dillon wasn't nominated for an Oscar.",/review/rw4574431/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2018,ethancarmanmoore,9," The House That Jack Built (2018) Review
","I just saw Lars Von Trier's new film 'The House That Jack Built' at the Atlantic Film Festival. I'm not extremely familiar with Trier's other work (I love Antichrist and Dancer in the dark is one of the most depressing films I've ever seen), but I've still been looking forward to this one since its premiere at Cannes. The subject matter peaked my interest and the trailer looked great. The early reviews got me even more invested as everyone was saying it was Trier's most disturbing and violent film yet.",/review/rw4574431/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2021,toddlinsley-98410,9," Brutal
","This one was difficult to watch. I think it is one of the best serial killer movies out there. Perfect blend of gore, dark humor, shock value, and artsy farts stuff. I loved it. Weird and entertaining. This is the type of movie that makes you feel like you need a shower after. Matt Dillon did an amazing job. Only a certain audience will like this movie. You have been warned.",/review/rw4574431/?ref_=tt_urv

Jack, who has obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and the nickname ""Mr. Sophistication"", randomly reports five incidents to show Verge that his murders are artwork. However Verge tells that love is missing in his works to be art. Meanwhile Jack builds and demolishes the house searching for the correct material.",/review/rw4574431/?ref_=tt_urv

24 August 2020,UniqueParticle,9," Very artsy, sadistic, and captivating
","A Von Lars Trier expedition of peculiar sorts, quite bizarre, beautifully filmed and written! Matt Dillion as Jack serial killer with OCD among other traits. I see why this has mixed reviews it's not for everyone and a little boring but well worth in my opinion. I love the cinematography and how David Bowie's Fame is in it many times! I highly recommend The House That Jack Built, it's very well made.",/review/rw4574431/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2021,youngcollind,9," It's sick, twisted and often hard to watch, but if one has any familiarity with Lars von Trier, it's surprisingly one of his more accessible outings
","The theme of serial killer provides ample opportunity for some of the most disturbing segments ever put to film. However, the storytelling is good and the film often frames the titular Jack a bit comedically, which occasionally lightens the mood of the very grim subject matter. It also goes out of it's way to condemn and vilify his actions so that von Trier doesn't need to be put on a public watch list. Nevertheless, you'll need a strong stomach and taste for the macabre to find enjoyment in this gruesome tale.",/review/rw4574431/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2019,mikedegroot,3," Not Good
","I wanted to like this movie. I really did. But there are way too many things that drag it down. First off, it's slow. Reeeaally slow. Now that wouldn't be such a bad thing, but it's also really long. The dialouge is very monotone and not engaging. Honestly, I have never been so bored watching people get murdered. Even the action is derivative and difficult to pay attention to. There is some good acting and it is shot well, but that does not save it from being boring. By the time I got to the end, all I wanted was for it to finally be over with. But instead it just limps alongs even slower to a completely nonsensical finish. I'm not a huge fan of art films, and this one is the reason why. Overall, it's quite overrated and really only appeals to a small target audience.",/review/rw4574431/?ref_=tt_urv
