18 October 2015,Prismark10,8," A fix in time
",Peter Straughan condenses Hilary Mantel's award winning historical fiction novels for television. Peter Kominsky gets all the candles he needs for gloomily lit interiors but more importantly gets out great performances from his actors and a wonderful paced drama. There is little here that is stuffy or po faced.,/review/rw3205445/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2015,paul2001sw-1,9," Imagines the past, instead of merely reflecting the present
","Hilary Mantel's superb novels 'Wolf Hall' and ""Bringing Out of the Bodies' manage to execute an extraordinary balance. On one hand, they rehabilitate the reputation of Thomas Cromwell, one of Henry VIII's advisors, who received wisdom portrays as a man of viciousness and ambition; according to Mantel, this picture dates only from Victorian times, and Mantel rehabilitates Cromwell as a surprisingly humanistic working class hero. But as the same time, she never strays into the territory of ascribing modern motives to the characters she wishes she have our sympathy, and ""primitive"" attitudes to the ones we're supposed to hate. Instead, she brings us inside the morality of the times: the fact that it doesn't map cleanly onto our own is precisely what makes the books interesting. This BBC television adaption can't quite replicate the stream-of-consciousness from inside Cromwell's head provided by the novels, and almost inevitably it's a bit more Tudors-by-numbers. But it doesn't do a bad job either, avoiding the obvious clich√©s and giving us a convincing realisation of Mantel's work that captures most, if not quite all, of its inherent subtlety. Mark Rylance is simply superb as Cromwell, and most of the other actors offer a convincing interpretation of their roles, especially Claire Foy as Anne Boleyn, the minor noblewoman who punches above her weight all the way to the chopping block. What's still to come is the third (as yet unwritten) book of the trilogy, and the fall that follows Cromwell's rise. I look forward to it as novel and television alike.",/review/rw3205445/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2016,TheLittleSongbird,9," One of 2015 television's highlights

23 January 2015,Essex_Rider,10," The best BBC drama ever.....Bar none
","This wonderful drama just held me spellbound from the opening sequence to the closing shots of the first episode. Mark Rylance was just mesmerising, from the moment he appeared he held me in thrall. The atmospheric lighting, the scenery, the period clothing, all a wonder, but the acting! It was a genuine privilege to see something that will be talked about for years to come. I felt I was there, in the dark recessed corridors of power, with betrayal lurking around every dark corner. Thomas Cromwell is such a fixture in our national DNA it was almost scary to see him bought to life, but he, along with Henry, laid the foundations for a Britain that was sure of its own identity and purpose. I know I will view this for many years and never tire of the many nuances and shadows. Wonderful, simply simply wonderful.",/review/rw3205445/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2015,maria-ricci-1983,10," Exquisite production, superb acting and, at last a realistic Middle-Age lighting!

6 April 2015,donb-519-335075,9," Cromwell walks (fearless) among giants
","As a life long Anglophile - with a special passion for the Tudors, I could not wait for this series - after only the first episode, I was not disappointed. Wolf Hall is the story of a (not so well known) Tudor personage Thomas Cromwell - lawyer and confidant of Cardinal Wolsey - who at one time early in Henry VIII's reign was ""the most powerful man in England."" After Wolsey's decline (none of them stay on top forever), Cromwell worked with King Henry VIII directly. ",/review/rw3205445/?ref_=tt_urv

","A loving and faithful screen rendering of one of the most remarkable novels published in recent memory, Wolf Hall brings to life the gripping story of Thomas Cromwell, whose story unfolds in front of the backdrop of Tudor England with its mercurial personalities and ever-changing political fortunes.

23 January 2015,ianlouisiana,10," A real working - class hero.
","King Henry V111th was the last absolute monarch of England.His reign is often considered as more or less one of terror with not even the highest in the land safe from his fearful wrath and its symbol - the axe.And yet the two most powerful commoners in the land were,successively,the son of a country butcher and the son of a Putney blacksmith. In the enlightened,liberal,free - thinking 21st century the most powerful commoner in the land is an Old Etonian and former member of an elitist club at an elitist university. It seems we have progressed from a Tudor meritocracy to a New Elizabethan era of privilege and preference in 500 bloody years of struggle,revolt,civil war and political posturing. In Wolsey and Cromwell's day it was easier for a poor man to improve himself by the use of his wit and intelligence. And ruthlessness,of course. In ""Wolf Hall"",all these qualities are gradually revealed by Thomas Cromwell as portrayed by Mr M.Rylance,an actor in whose face subtlety takes on a whole new meaning. Behind the calm exterior a keen brain is all the while reckoning the odds,from playing ""Find the Lady"" with his mentor Cardinal Wolsey to a show of dumb insolence towards Mistress Boleyn at a time when she was at her most powerful. At the end of the first episode he gainsays the king in a display of moral courage which Henry is forced to grudgingly admire. This is the one great production the present BBC has always had in it but has until now lacked the raw material to match its talent roster. With Miss H.Mantel's two epic novels set in and around the Tudor Court safely in the bag all that remained was for the Corporation to do what it was once world - famous for; make the very best drama it possibly could and in this it has succeeded admirably. As beautiful to look at as it is to listen to,well - chosen settings often lit like a Holbein come to life and not relying on over - familiar actors trotting out their usual schtick,""Wolf Hall"" looks set to restore the reputation of our national broadcaster and ensure its independent future.",/review/rw3205445/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2015,tom.keller,10," Well, 9.5 anyway
","I don't like giving ratings of 10 out of 10 because it implies that it can't be improved, which is never the case, but when I see drama as well written and well performed as this I want to see ratings that reflect that and respect it, and my 10/10 aims to redress some of the, in my opinion, ludicrous ratings of 1/10 that I see have been posted here. First the imperfections: I'm not sure why Peter Kosminsky, whose work I very much rate, has gone for hand held camera work in what is essentially a static shot. I have no problem with hand-held camera work per se, but the reasons for its use in a wide shot are lost on me, and the result is a slightly irritating amount of camera shake. Secondly, the time shifts could be a little clearer - blink and you miss the captions, and that's if they've actually been included. I think on one occasion the shift was implied rather than signalled. I suppose it does keep the audience on their toes.",/review/rw3205445/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2015,negomiretsof,10," Turn your lights out!
","Before we watched the programme, I read a review which complained about the darkness of the screen. We turned all the lights out and were totally enthralled. Mr Starkey has blown his bombast again, not having read or seen the programme. This is television, and great television at that. There might not be documentary evidence that Cromwell was sad at the death of his wife and children, but it stands to reason that he might well have been! The programme is like a series of old master paintings, the people inhabiting these settings totally realistic and believable. Mark Rylance's portrayal of Cromwell is human, kind and unpretentious: an absolute tour de force. Minimalist, lacking bombast (unlike Mr Starkey!) and memorable. I love the whole thing.",/review/rw3205445/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2015,parklife7,9," Excellent series well worth watching
","Having only seen this really from Thomas More's perspective in 'A Man for all Seasons' (a brilliant film) I was intrigued to see it from the 'villain's' point of view which is what Cromwell was in the film. This has been quite an eye opener for me and I am absolutely hooked on the BBC series right now. It got off to a fairly slow start in episode 1 in setting the background for the story but it has just got better and better, the acting from Rylance and Lewis etc is superb and Mark Rylance is not too dissimilar in appearance from Cromwell's actual appearance. Another superb costume drama from the BBC and long may it continue if this is the standard we can expect for future productions.",/review/rw3205445/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2021,Laight,9," Excellent historical drama
","Anne Boleyn's story has been told countless times, but here it is from the viewpoint of Thomas Cromwell, one of the lesser known but major figures in English history. Once rather ignored, in the last fifty years or so Cromwell's reputation has been rightly resuscitated and his importance studied. Here he comes alive as a man from working class origins who rises to become the king's most reliable advisor. The story is well told, the acting superb, the sets magnificent. The only downsides are 1) the prevalent trope in TV now where a character says something important to another but there's no response--the scene ends; it's as if people in TV don't know how make a reply. Weird. The other is Jessica Raine's pouty acting style--but she's the only malfunction in another wise perfect cast, lead by the extraordinary Mark Rylance and the equally good Claire Foy, and featuring terrific smaller roles from upcoming actors (at the time) like Tom Holland and Edward Holcroft.",/review/rw3205445/?ref_=tt_urv

","Trading in superlatives can will loose you your audience quickly B U T this is one of the best things I have ever seen on television, ' never gave anything nine stars before seeing this series. The acting is superb , the writing is so well crafted and deft and the production values are as good as they get. It would not matter where it was or the what the setting was. If you watch even a minute you will see how good this is and it will not disappoint as you continue to watch. ' can't praise it enough.",/review/rw3205445/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2015,kcaprani,10," superlative drama at its best
","Wolf hall tells a tale that most watchers will already be familiar with, it is after all essentially a historical drama based around the reign of a famous English king, the fact that it never bores or fails to entertain is testament to the brilliance with which the story is told, i would compare this to another brilliant and much lauded bbc drama i Claudius, long held up as the best of British drama, the story is intelligently written and beautifully paced, the acting is perfection throughout, it is filled with political intrigue and family rivalries of the rich and powerful, this is no bawdy sexed up rendition such as the Tudors for example, it is a serious thoughtful study of the events in king Henry 8 court, and the fall out from the demands of a monarch who is at once both charming and erratically dangerous to be associated with,if you want action and fanciful dialog then go elsewhere but for deep meaningful drama with beauty and power look no further, for people who have given this drama low ratings they are of course entitled to, but i am mystified by this and really the average rating should be around 9 for this work of genius.",/review/rw3205445/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2015,portobellolinda,8," Superb
","Watching the first episode actually put me to sleep. The pace is very slow to begin with and the lighting is low, the actors voices rather drowsy but, I watched it again on catchup and am so glad I did. This is a superb piece of historical drama, not entirely factual but nonetheless, superb. Great acting from all with the one exception of the actress playing Ann's sister, whom I thought rather too modern looking for the part. Now onto the series. The lighting in this was very realistic, the acting almost faultless and the natural pauses in speech were allowed here, which on screen is something very rare indeed. The ellipsis were excellent and we really were given a flavor of what it was that made up the character from child to man, which added to a sense of congruity for me. I would have given this one a 10 star review but, for me, it seemed one episode short. The characters demise was not shown and I think this was a real error on the part of the director. However, it was beautiful to watch and overall, very enjoyable.",/review/rw3205445/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2015,mgumsley,9," Wolf Hall
","Hilary Mantel must be very impressed with the way BBC2 captured the spirit and tone of the turbulent Tudor era from the rise of Cromwell to the death of Anne Boleyn in Wolf Hall. The screenwriter condensed Bring Up the Bodies into just two episodes, but the storyline was easy to follow and did not feel rushed. All in all, I loved the series, both for the acting and the beautiful settings. Of course, Master Cromwell dominated by saying very little and conveying much with his masterful presence and quietly sympathetic character. At the same time, you had to admire the ambition and intellect he displayed in giving the king the wealth and freedom he needed to propel England into becoming a major state in Europe. Of course we know Henry's private life was marred by his obsessive need for a son, a desire fuelled by the tenuous nature of the Tudor's claim to the crown and the proliferation of Plantagenets that still existed at that time. Damian Lewis made an impressive Henry, still dashing and not yet quite a complete monster, although petulant and demanding. Mark Rylance's quiet almost withdrawn portrayal was so watchful, so intelligent, you feel this might well become his signature role. And Claire Foy made an intelligent and scheming Anne, who surely would have made a marvellous queen should she have managed to produce the sons Henry desired. All I want now is for Ms Mantel to finish the story of Cromwell's remarkable life, even though we all know it ends in tragedy.",/review/rw3205445/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2015,jane-239-715454,10," Amazing, the quality of this production is fantastic
","This production is first class, there is not one jarring note anywhere. The acting is finely drawn and deeply layered and I am transfixed from the opening to closing credits. The director and production team have done a fantastic job bringing this novel to life. I truly believe this is the best drama I have ever seen on television. It feels like I have stepped into a time machine and am witnessing these events of Tudor England first hand. I sincerely hope that the whole ensemble stay together in order to bring other productions to life and if so, I will be the first in line to watch them. In the meantime, I will be incredibly sorry when I have finished watching the end of the series. Many congratulations to all involved.",/review/rw3205445/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2016,maksim_nikiforovski,10," A magnificent character study of Thomas Cromwell, and a grandiose portrayal of the Tudor era.
","There are many shows and films about the Tudors. The dashing king Henry VIII, the mysteriously alluring Anne Boleyn, the Machiavellian Cromwell and the wise Thomas More. There are so many great characters from that era that one can choose any of them and tell a magnificent story. That was done in these books and it is done impeccably on the screen as well. This story focuses on Thomas Cromwell, who is portrayed as less Machiavellian and more sympathetic, but incredibly clever nonetheless. ",/review/rw3205445/?ref_=tt_urv

2 August 2019,dromasca,9," what the BBC does best
","A BBC historical series represents a summit meeting for history buffs and quality television lovers. The reign of Henry VIII is an inexhaustible source of historical fiction - literary or for the screens of all sizes. Few other historical periods have gathered in a few years so many exceptional historical personalities, dramas and intrigues combining faith, betrayal, eroticism, violence. Few other moments in history have represented crossroads for the character of a people and for the evolution of one of the world's great religions. Lovers of literature and historical films never seem to be satisfied with new perspectives of the characters of the saga that took place at the English royal court in the first half of the 16th century. BBC's 'Wolf Hall' directed by Peter Kosminsky is an achievement of excellent quality in this genre, benefiting as a starting point of a valuable literary source which are the novels of Hilary Mantel, winner of the Man Booker and National Book Critics Circle Awards, books received excellently by an enthusiastic audience of readers that turned them into best-sellers.",/review/rw3205445/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2021,slappysquirrel_2000,9," stellar performances
","What can I say, the brilliant Mark Rylance. I find an actor gives the better performance when it is understated, and that is what this is. I think this is one of Damian Lewis's best roles, although somewhat skinny! I've seen many, many shows about the Tudors from the beginnings. This is one of my favorites. I find it interesting that they show how people ate in this period, with their hands. Realistic. And about the lighting.....again, realistic.",/review/rw3205445/?ref_=tt_urv
