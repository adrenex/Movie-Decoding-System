20 December 2009,vip_ebriega,8," Take another trip to Del Toro's labyrinth.
",My Take: An elaborate set of imaginative creature effects and the always interesting lead character make the show worth watching.,/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2008,ametaphysicalshark,," Very good
","You know you're not watching a formulaic comic book film when one of the highlights is a drunken rendition of ""Can't Smile Without You"" by Hellboy and Abe Sapien. ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" is a more confident, assured outing than the first film and while it does not draw from Mignola's comics for its plot it is perhaps better off for it, lacking the usual burden of comparison and expectations. ""The Golden Army"" is more fantastical than the first film and is less sci-fi oriented but this is the sort of thing Del Toro does exceptionally well as a writer. He never lets the fantasy become the focus of the film, instead concentrating on characters and delivering action scenes that can only be described as, forgive the crass immaturity, kickass.",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2012,Leofwine_draca,8," A labour of love, and it shows
","HELLBOY II threatens to be nothing more than your latest CGI-laden braindead Hollywood action movie, and yet it's not, thanks to the presence of director Guillermo del Toro. Del Toro has to possess one of the most imaginative minds in Hollywood and he brings a level of creativity to the movie that's sorely lacking in most genre fare getting released these days. Del Toro's imagination comes to the fore in the myriad creatures he creates for this movie, bringing to life monster upon monster with no end to the creativity in sight.",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2008,Angelus2,10," A Christmas Fantasy/Action Movie
","Its Christmas and we find Hellboy with his dad as they wait for Father Christmas and then Hellboy is captivated by a story about a long lost empire, a hidden army and a exiled prince.",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2008,Smells_Like_Cheese,8," Visually stunning and surpasses the first Hellboy by far
","When I saw the trailer for Hellboy II: The Golden Army, I hadn't seen the first Hellboy, so before I saw the sequel, I wanted to see the first movie, so I rented it and when I watched it, I wasn't really thrilled with it. I mean, it was a decent movie, but it wasn't something I would watch again, so I was thinking that the sequel was going to be a bust and probably not do much for the story, for what they had at least. Another thing was that the people that I talked to who had seen this movie before I saw it said that it was horrible and a waste of time, but I still did want to see this movie, so I decided to go ahead and just judge for myself. After all, I do admire Guillermo del Toro's style, his visions are eye candy and his stories can be incredible, so Hellboy II: The Golden Army? It seriously was so awesome! It was a whole lot better and stronger than the first Hellboy.",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2008,DarthVoorhees,7," Visually it's outstanding, Mentally it's mediocre
","Del Torro's imagination is a beautiful thing. He has created some of the most fascinating creatures that traditional Hollywood doesn't have the guts or inclination to ever assemble. I would take Guillmero Del Torro in the director's chair any time any place, but Hellboy II shows that he is not without his flaws. Ron Perlman who is terrific as Hellboy doesn't have anything truly interesting to say or do, the world around him is magical but the plot isn't.",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2008,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,9," Del Toro cements his place as a contemporary visionary. Brilliant, stylish, hilarious, and great.
","I have long felt that the first Hellboy installment is one of the most underrated films of the 2000's. The first thing you notice about both the first film and this more than worthy successor is the passion. Everything is simply beautiful (not in the typical beautiful sense, but in that you appreciate the art that it is), and it should come as no surprise as the film's director, Guillermo Del Toro, is a long time fan of the comic stories on which the movie is based. Del Toro turned down multiple high profile projects, including multiple Harry Potter films, so he could work on the Hellboy series, which we all know will not gross as much money. Del Toro's passion for excellence is evident in this wonderful sequel, which is better than the first, and cements Del Toro's place as one of the top filmmakers of today.",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2016,sam_smithreview,9," Simply put, a well deserved sequel to its fans
","Let me start of by saying that Del Toro had one message to the fans, and it was ""I will not disappoint""",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2008,Dragoneyed363,9," Surprisingly on par with Hellboy
","This is something special; when a second film in a series is able to surpass or equal to it's predecessor. It's not just because the first Hellboy was so excellent, which it was, but they handled this second film with such care and pizazz, it's almost better, in ways, than the first.",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2008,brando647,9," Much Better than the First, IMHO...
","I honestly didn't expect much when I first saw this movie. I was a fan of the first film, though it wasn't anything spectacular and I figured this would be more of the same. Wow, no. This movie was SO much better than the first, in my opinion; it was easily one of my favorite movies from 2008. I'm not saying the first was bad, I just found myself bored a lot easier at times. But this film was just flat-out more entertaining. Hellboy and the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense find themselves caught up when an elven prince declares war on the human race and attempts to awaken the invincible Golden Army to aid him.",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2008,FosterBreadford,," Can't Smile Without You
","okay, I'll start out simple. This movie is not Gone With the Wind. It isn't Ben Hur, not even Pan's Labyrinth. it is no fantastic achievement in film that will go down in the history books. But really, it's Hellboy - does it really need to be a classic? Honestly, I loved this movie. It was pure fun. I found the first Hellboy movie to be a fun movie. . .but it lacked that certain something that was keeping it from being a great movie. This one introduces all new mythology into the series, which allows director Guillermo Del Toro to invent all sorts of new creatures that all look amazing. The visual aspect of this film is classic, nothing short of amazing. The movie has some flaws, a few strange possible plot holes, but by the end of the day, the humor rules the day, and the humor hit spot on, to make a very funny film. I can't get the song ""I can't Smile Without You"" now after seeing this film. That segment was hilarious. Hellboy succeeds in being a film with a decent story, good visual work, and great characters with great humor, all to make just an overall FUN movie where Indiana Jones couldn't. (I only mean Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) For someone who believes any film that doesn't win 11 Oscars isn't worth watching, I'll be honest, you'll hate Hellboy 2. For someone who goes in expecting only to be entertained, just to have a fun time, I 100% recommend this film to that kind of person. Go see it, it's very worth it.",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2008,claudio_carvalho,8," Power, Love and Self-Sacrifice
","At the dawn of the time, men, beasts and magic beings lived together; however, the infinite greed of men made a hole in their hearts and possession, power and knowledge were not able to fill them and they fought against the magic beings. The King Balor (Roy Dotrice) of the elf, ogres and goblins accept the offer of a powerful and invincible golden mechanical army composed of 70 times 70 soldiers; a magic crown is forged and associated to the royal blood of King Balor, he commands the army and defeats men. A truce is negotiated with the cities belonging to men and the forests to the magic beings; the indestructible golden army is locked inside the earth and the crown is split in three parts. On the present days, the exiled Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) breaks in the Blackwood's auction house in Manhattan to retrieve one piece of the crown. He uses the evil tooth fairies to destroy the auctioneer and seventy guests, and then he attacks his father to get the second part of the crown. However, his twin sister Princess Nuala (Anna Walton) escapes with the third part. Meanwhile, in the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense in Trento, New Jersey, headed by Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor), Hellboy (Ron Perlman), Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) and Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) go to Blackwood to investigate the mystery. When Hellboy is exposed to the press, the specialist in ectoplasm Johann Krauss (James Dodd) is assigned the substitute for Manning in the Bureau. The group moves to Brooklyn Bridge wearing special glasses to find the troll market and get information about the tooth fairies; however they meet Princess Nuala and discover the evil intentions of her ambitious twin brother.",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2019,CountVladDracula,10," Hellboy 2 is very underrated
","I love this film. It's brilliantly acted with some darkness and just the right amount of whimsy and heart. Abe Sapien's love story is endearing nad very well acted. Luke Goss was fantastically cast as Prince Nuada. There is a certain sense of quality, effort, and depth in the original Hellboy movies that is utterly lacking in the remake.",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2020,filipemanuelneto,3," Great look, and superb make-up work, but that's it.
","This film is the long-awaited sequel to ""Hellboy"", based on a comic and made in the wake of the fashion of comic-based films that has been a trend in the movies. The film continues the story of the son of Lucifer who came to live among us and defends humans from the dangers of the supernatural world. In this film, he is eager to feel recognized for his efforts, but his work and his very existence remain secret. However, he will have to prevent a war between humans and beings from the supernatural world, who want to control the legendary Golden Army.",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2008,g-bodyl,10," Better Than the Original!
","Hellboy 2 is such an exciting movie, visually and mentally. This is much better than the first Hellboy and I liked the first one a lot. Guillermo Del Toro is one of the better directors of our time. This movie is about an evil elf who wants to unlock the dormant golden army to dominate Earth and take back what he thinks is rightfully his. But, our favorite red action hero, Hellboy and the rest of his FBI gang including Abe Sapien, the German Johan Krauss, and Hellboy's girlfriend, Liz is not about to let that happen. The visuals are fantastic. This is one of the reasons Del Toro is a great director. He is creative designing these creatures in this movie. I really liked the Angel of Death. The acting is pretty good. Ron Perlman did a superb job playing the wisecracking Hellboy. The music is even better than the first film. I like Danny Elfman more than Marco Beltrami. This film may be a bit scary for younger children. I rate this film 10/10.",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2008,moviewizguy,9," Saving the world is a hell of a job
","In this continuation to the adventure of the demon superhero, an evil elf breaks an ancient pact between humans and creatures, as he declares war against humanity. He is on a mission to release The Golden Army, a deadly group of fighting machines that can destroy the human race. As Hell on Earth is ready to erupt, Hellboy and his crew set out to defeat the evil prince before The Golden Army can destroy humanity's existence.",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2008,MaxBorg89,9," A fantasy in comic-book disguise: beautiful, exciting and fun
","With the first Hellboy, there was a feeling that for all the good things in it (Ron Perlman especially) Guillermo del Toro wasn't allowed to do all he wanted. Now, with the success of Pan's Labyrinth, not to mention Universal instead of Sony, he has been granted complete freedom, and the result is Hellboy II: The Golden Army, the second best sequel of 2008 after The Dark Knight (Indiana Jones is a) a number four; b) a different genre, and therefore doesn't count).",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2008,brechtbug,10," Hellboy II - Back And Better Than Ever!
","I just got back from a preview screening of ""Hellboy II And The Golden Army"" and of all the films I've seen so far this summer Hellboy is the ONLY one to exceed my expectations. I love the second films of a super hero franchise (Superman II, Spiderman II, The Incredible Hulk) because the heroes have been introduced and the origins are out of the way so the story can begin from the start unfettered. This film is not just about Action, Action, Action but about character development and their interaction. I liked ""Pan's Labrynth"" but felt a little bit let down when the creature's personalities were not explored enough. This film takes the time to establish who Abe Sapien is beyond being defined as a fish man. Johann Krauss is a great uptight Teutonic addition to the old team with a few tricks up his sleeve and Hellboy & Liz's professional and personal relationship get more play in this film. The detail in the troll market is amazing and the story rings true to the Mike Mignola comics without having to lift a story arc from any one specific past issue. Bravo! Guillermo del Toro! I can't wait for Hellboy III.",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2008,LazySod,6," A mere shadow of the first
","Our red anti-hero is back. Together with the agency he's out to save the world again. And this time he's all gentle and careful about it. No, I'm kidding, he's just as rude and crude as he was the first time around.",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2008,Foolish,10," As Good as the First Hellboy!
",I took this in at the L.A. Film Festival closing night gala and really had a great time. I'm a HUGE fan of the comics and thought that the first movie was done just right.,/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2008,bkoganbing,8," Saving An Ungrateful Humanity

16 September 2018,Cool-Lion14,7," A pretty good sequel
","I was excited when I heard that the first Hellboy film was getting a sequel. And considering Guillermo Del Toro and Ron Perlman were returning, it was guaranteed to be a hit. More supernatural elements, more Abe Sapien, and more weirdness. I don't know how this movie fared at the box office or the critics, but I enjoyed it and I wouldn't mind seeing it again.",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2011,FairlyAnonymous,9," Better than the first in most ways
","Hellboy is one of those cult movies that most people will love, and other people won't get it. I am one of those people who love it. The first movie was definitely interesting because it was a bit different than most super hero movies. The first movie was a bit dark and humorous at the same time, but it had very lovable characters. well that was the first movie, let's talk about Hellboy II: the golden army.",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2008,Imrak,10," The Second is Always Best
","What is it about super-hero films (X-Men 2, Spiderman 2, Superman II, and likely The Dark Knight) that the best of them are always the middle chapter; the second episode? I personally have no clue, but Hellboy II is not the exception.",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," It's good movie to watch
","Surprisingly good funny action. Selma, girl, cute, was a nice touch. The action is all good, good efffects and a story that held together. It's a bit strange and creepy at times but all in good fun. Many good ideas.",/review/rw5503085/?ref_=tt_urv
