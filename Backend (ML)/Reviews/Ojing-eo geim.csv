18 April 2022,spookyrat1,9," Value Added Sequel!
","Cannot believe the number of people who are claiming this movie is the same as the first. Just ridiculous! I have to wonder whether they saw the same A Quiet Place Part 2 that I saw. It obviously follows similar themes but builds on the story and further develops the characters. You have to give it up to writer/producer/director and actor John Krasinski. He has delivered a sequel which really enhances the story he introduced in Part 1 but this time, is played out on a much broader canvas.",/review/rw8182595/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2021,ThomDerd,7," Nicely predictable.
","Although AQPII is not bad, it does look like an attempt to cash in. There's a few problems with it and most of them are in the storyline. Here is an overall difference with the first film:",/review/rw8182595/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2021,neil-476,7," So blind dumb aliends outwit humans?
","After a brief flashback to Day 1, this film picks up from where Part 1 left off, with newly widowed Evelyn tiptoeing away from her burning house with her kids, deaf Regan, Marcus, and strangely silent baby The Baby. They fall in with Emmett, and Regan wants to take her squealing hearing aid to an island redio transmitter in order to mess up the critters' hearing.",/review/rw8182595/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2022,tim-stjames,8," A Worthy Sequel
","If nothing else, I'm primarily impressed with how these films seem like a cinematic franchise built out of the raptors in the kitchen sequence from Jurassic Park. This is the very rare sequel that at the very least is equal to what came before and it reminded me how much I missed going to the movies.",/review/rw8182595/?ref_=tt_urv

8 June 2021,giongalini,5," I honestly thought I missed something...
","When the movie ended I was left with the distinct feeling that I must have missed something, because Quite Place Part II seemed to me the exact same film as Part I, albeit with some new characters added to the cast.",/review/rw8182595/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2022,tles7,6," Disappointing follow-up
","I liked how the story begins with how the whole invasion began. They should have spent more time on this. As a matter of fact, this should have been a worldwide view of how humanity failed against the invasion. Instead, you get a story that at times makes you wonder if you missed something (on the pier especially). Also, the son appears to have gotten stupid since the first movie. The ending is rather contrived. With all the periods of silence in the movie and the style of showing two or three parts of the story all intermingled at once, you get very aware of the director ""doing something"". It weakens the film. The ending is so contrived that you think.....""say whattttt"". The characters' decisions in this movie make for many plot holes where their actions in the original are not something you question. So is the sequel how they get the daughter's discovery out there, If you can believe no one else figured this out. For that matter, I wondered how this type of creature can create and fly a spaceship. Do they multiply here? Were they kicked off a planet like Alien Nation? These creatures don't seem to have intelligence, organization or government. It's like the dinosaurs figured out how to build a spaceship and fly through space. The movie grossed about $350 million so there will be an unnecessary sequel. Watch a movie called ""Earth vs. The Flying Saucers"" from the mid-1950s and you will see the same ""discovery"" on how to kill the monsters.",/review/rw8182595/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2021,jtindahouse,8," There's a lot to like but Krasinski's character leaves a big hole
","I always say the opening scene/sequence of a film is crucial, and even more so in a horror movie. When the title card 'Day 1' pops up at the beginning of 'A Quiet Place Part 2' you know you are in for a treat. And it is a truly great sequence. I'm not normally a huge proponent of jump-scares, however the first one in this movie absolutely got me, and I'm rarely gotten. This sequence sets the tone for the film masterfully and then everything else flows from there.",/review/rw8182595/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2022,umichjal,9," Don't listen to the foolish reviews bashing it
","3/4 of the people think this is a good movie and I do as well. Better than the first movie, and adds to the knowledge of what is going on. The writing thing s better than the first movie, and adds to the lore. Minimizes the stupid CGI and expands on the storytelling for us. Recommend.",/review/rw8182595/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2022,nathanmanson,7," Sequels to horrors never work but this did
","The first one was definitely better but this was so good. Cillian Murphy was a perfect edition to the cast. I didn't think it'd work without John Krasinski but I was definitely wrong. I very glad there's been a third one announced because I'd have hated the ending to this other wise. I think as far as horror films go these are the best of the best. There's none like it, and any that are like it just aren't nearly as good.",/review/rw8182595/?ref_=tt_urv

11 April 2022,MickyG333,7," Almost as good as the first
","Replace Krasinski with Cillian Murphy. This movie is basically more of the same thing, maybe a bit less surprising, or fresh; but you could watch these back to back and it would feel like an extension of the same movie. I found myself rooting for Murphy's character after I got acquainted with him.",/review/rw8182595/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2022,welhof1,7," Decent suspenseful sequel
","I liked this as much as the first one. It was very suspenseful at parts and very slow other parts. My main gripe of these movies is how the characters act in certain situations. You scratch your head thinking no way they would do that. Anyway, a quick action thriller and worth the watch if you are a fan of the first one.",/review/rw8182595/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2022,resteban-94540,9," A high-flying sequel with the same dose of thrills
","The second installment of ""A quiet place II"" was one of the most anticipated and delayed films due to the pandemic.

16 June 2022,rubysfavourite,4," A Disappointing Sequel
","A thoroughly disappointing continuation of the original story. It's lost all the charm of the original and lost sight of what made it special. It's not a quiet place anymore at all; the monsters are incompetent and less frightening, and pose none of the tension or suspense of the original. The characters are one dimensional and lacklustre, and the plot is essentially one big McGuffin hunt which is really unfortunate. I think the premise this world offers is still a very intriguing one and could be taken in lots of interesting directions, but this movie doesn't offer that. Hopefully any future sequels can do better if they are made. There's some good aspects (such as the backstory to the monsters; I loved that) but overall I think the plot's weak and the spark is gone.",/review/rw8182595/?ref_=tt_urv

15 June 2021,jboothmillard,8," A Quiet Place Part II
","The original film was a brilliant scary movie, one of the best I've seen in the last few years, and I was most excited when the sequel was eventually released in cinemas. Basically, it opens with a flashback, to the beginning of the alien invasion. The Abbott family are attending a baseball game, with Marcus (Noah Jupe) playing. Mid-game, the spectators are bewildered to see a flaming object in the sky hurtling towards Earth. As people leave the park and try to drive away, the town is attacked by alien creatures with armoured skin, high speed, and extraordinary strength. Father and husband Lee (John Krasinski, also writing and directing) slowly realises that the creatures are blind but have hypersensitive hearing to hunt their victims. In present day, most of the population have been wiped out by the aliens, Lee was killed sacrificing himself to save his children. His remaining family are his wife Evelyn (Emily Blunt), now adolescent Marcus, deaf teenage daughter Regan (Millicent Simmonds), and a new-born baby son. Regan, who discovered that high-frequency audio feedback is the weakness of the creatures, has found that transmitting the noise from her cochlear implant hearing aid through a microphone and speaker makes the creatures vulnerable, allowing Evelyn to shoot them dead. With their isolated home on the fame destroyed, and finding this method to kill the monsters, the family leave to find refuge and search for other survivors. They bring Regan's kit to fend off the creatures. They enter a fenced-off area, and trigger a booby-trap, and when they are forced to run, Marcus steps into a bear trap. His subsequent screams attract a creature, but Regan uses the kit to weaken it and Evelyn kills it. They free Marcus and flee into an abandoned steel foundry as another creature approaches. Inside, they stumble upon Emmett (Cillian Murphy), a former friend of Lee's, who has become a recluse. He takes them inside to hide from the creature, in a sound-proof area, and reluctantly allows them to stay in the bunker, seeing the baby. To protect the baby, and avoid his cries attracting the attention of the creatures, he is being kept inside a box, containing a breathing mask connected to an oxygen tank. Whilst hiding in the foundry, Marcus and Regan discover a radio station signal that continuously plays the song, ""Beyond the Sea"" by Bobby Darin. Regan determines it is a clue meant to lead survivors to the salvation of a group of nearby islands. She theorises that if she can reach the radio tower, the hearing aid's high-frequency noise can be transmitted for survivors to weaponize against the creatures. After telling Marcus her plan, she secretly ventures out alone to find the broadcast station. Discovering Regan is gone, Evelyn implores Emmett to bring her back. Emmett finds Regan exploring an abandoned train, containing only the corpses of victims to the monsters. After averting a creature attracted to sound made on the locomotive, Emmett wants them to return to the foundry. Emmett is initially sceptical about the plan to find the radio station, theorising that there may be no survivors at all, but he is convinced by Regan that they have a sense of duty to help others if they can. Meanwhile, Evelyn leaves Marcus and the baby at the foundry to gather needed medical supplies and equipment, including canisters of oxygen. During her absence, Marcus explores the foundry and discovers the corpse of Emmett's wife. He is startled and knocks something, creating sound that alerts a nearby creature. Marcus narrowly gets into the bunker, but accidentally locks himself and the baby inside, with breathable air and the oxygen remaining in a tank running out. At a marina, Emmett and Regan search for a boat. They are ambushed by feral people who begin to search Regan for supplies. Emmett shouts out to attract two creatures that slaughter the deranged inhabitants. Boarding a vessel, Emmett sees one creature drown and realises the aliens cannot swim. Regan secures a small boat and the two find the island where a small colony of survivors have settled, and they are living a relatively normal existence, with no need for silence. The colony leader (Djimon Hounsou) reveals that when the government discovered the creatures were unable to swim, the National Guard moved as many people as possible to the islands. Meanwhile, Marcus and the baby are still trapped in the air-tight bunker and are close to suffocating. Evelyn returns and distracts the creatures, using one of the two canisters she collected to ignite the monster, saving her children. The three continue hiding inside the bunker as the creature prowls the foundry. A creature that boarded a yacht at the marina has drifted to the island and immediately begins attacking the colonists. The colony leader, Emmett, and Regan jump into a car and lead the creature to the radio station. The creature kills the leader while Emmett and Regan make it inside. While Regan finds the source of the signal, a creature comes in to attack. The creature is about to kill Emmett, when Regan transmits the high frequency through the room's speakers, incapacitating the creature. She impales the alien's exposed head with a metal rod, killing it and saving Emmett. At the same time, the creature at the foundry has discovered the bunker. It attacks Evelyn, but before it can kill her, Regan's transmission plays through Marcus's portable radio, incapacitating the creature. Marcus shoots it dead with Evelyn's revolver. Regan leaves her hearing aid connected to the radio station's microphone, allowing anyone receiving the frequency to fight the creatures. Also starring Scoot McNairy as Marina Man, Dean Woodward as Beau Abbott, Okieriete Onaodowan as Police Officer, Zachary Golinger as Emmett's son, and Lauren Ashley Cristiano as Emmett's wife. The clever premise using the sense of sound is just about as tense as before, I was a little annoyed there was whispering in certain scenes, but the atmosphere remains eerie and immersive. The post-apocalyptic world is expanded, the survival element continues to be good, the monsters are still the stuff of nightmares, and the score by Marco Beltrami is terrific, overall, a satisfactory horror. Very good!",/review/rw8182595/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2022,matris1,8," More of the same, but still a well constructed action-horror film
","The good: The film in of itself, is well made - everything from cinematography to lighting, sound, action, pacing etc. Big props for that. And of course the acting from the leads (including the younger actors) is excellent. I also like the way the 'passing of the torch' is shot - clearly defined parallels are drawn that make it easy to see the directors vision.",/review/rw8182595/?ref_=tt_urv
