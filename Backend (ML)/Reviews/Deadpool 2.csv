9 July 1999,BratBoy-2,," . This road will never end. It probably goes all around the world.
","This movie isn't about being, or even about being a hustler.  ""My Own Private Idaho"" is about finding a home.  In his finest performance, River Phoenix plays Mike, a narcoleptic street hustler with false memories of a terrific childhood.  Mike wants to find his mother and family, but how or why he left them is never discussed. This is a movie that shows life at the lowest rung, and is very similar to Kerouac's ""On the Road"" and especially John Rechy's ""City of Night.""  (In fact the line about becoming a fairy is straight from ""City of Night""). Mike and Scott (Keanu Reeves) are both male prostitutes in Oregon.  Why either of them have drifted into this profession is anyone's guess.  Scott is clearly not gay, but Mike might be and their relationship is what holds the movie together. The film works on many levels, but does have its flaws.  It's faux-Shakespearen scenes make the film drag in the middle.  Van Sant directed the movie like a dream, which is what Mike's life basically is.",/review/rw1498082/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2004,Benedict_Cumberbatch,," ""Wherever, whatever, have a nice day, River Phoenix""
","I watched this film on TV 5 years ago, when I was only eleven years old, and I remember that I was especially impressed by River Phoenix's magnificent performance. I had already watched ""Stand By Me"" (one of my favorites), and it was very interesting to watch him older in such a daring film. I think he was the best actor of his generation but, unfortunately, he died too young. His film legacy and his magnificent aura, however, live on forever.",/review/rw1498082/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2005,Asa_Nisi_Masa2,10," A triumph of pathos and bitter poetry
","I adore this movie, have owned it on VHS long before there was anything else and have seen it an insane number of times. It isn't perfect, but with me personally, though I'm a European female and thus have no personal life experience that could resemble anything the main characters go through, it struck a chord of universality that made it heart-breaking. The pathos in it, the bitter poetry, the warped magic is just unbelievably beautiful... and painful. It is visually inventive and the casting - even Keanu Reeves's, which has been so often criticised - is top-notch. Reeves's character is a flippant, spoilt young man who goes through life acting in his own self-glorifying drama: what better actor to cast in that role than someone whose acting is so contrived? And Phoenix... well, what can I say... to me, this is THE River Phoenix role, the one that can single-handedly turn him into an immortal, a legend. The Shakespearian quotations I adored: the relationship between Prince Hal and Falstaff from Henry IV, Part II is among the most mesmerising of the Bard's dramatic repertoire - that play was like an emotional earthquake to me. My Own Private Idaho caught its spirit perfectly, and translated it into a context that was original in its own right yet more faithful to Shakespeare in feeling than a more literal transposition might have been. Also, I found the portrayal of Rome in the part in which River's character goes out there to search for his mother, refreshingly true to life and totally clich√©-free. As an Italian from Rome, it's very rare that I see a non-Italian film portraying my city of origin with so much authenticity. The FEEL of the place at a given time - the late 80s - was spot-on. In conclusion: to me, not only was My Own Private Idaho one of the best adaptations of (at least parts) of a Shakespeare play that I've seen, but also a tragedy of almost Shakespearian intensity in its own right. It had it all: the unhealthy, consuming passion (the fatal flaw), the power struggles, the young heir in his reckless, youthful days eventually maturing into the arrogance of the privileged (Keanu), the parental ghost that one of the protagonists looks to as his prophetic voice, the voice that may give his life a meaning (River's search for and the flashbacks to the memory of his mother), the intense pathos throughout, the tragic deaths at the end... that film is just pure magic to me! Just writing about it makes me want to see it again - what, for the 20th time or something?! And the tragedy at My Own Private Idaho's core is so universal, it really becomes completely secondary whether it's about and between men, women, homosexuals or heterosexuals.",/review/rw1498082/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2001,KMW2000,10," Odd, touching, River Phoenix is intensely brilliant..
","This is the movie that I sincerely hope River Phoenix will long be remembered for. His performance as the narcoleptic and confused street-hustler Mike is so perfect and touching and realistic that it makes me cry every time. Gus Van Sant's films often have a strange aura about them (see Drugstore Cowboy, To Die For) and never has it been more evident than in this oddly affecting road movie/drama. The camera shots of long horizon-spanning roads and skylines, fast-motion clouds, surreal and symbolic shots of houses and rushing rivers provide the film with a strange almost other-worldly charm. Interspersed with the gritty realism of life on the streets of Portland Oregon in the early 90's, and (stranger still) Shakespeare. Some of the plot (Bob and Scott mainly) is based on the Shakespeare play Henry IV (with Keanu Reeves playing the Prince Hal character of Scott, and William Richert playing the Falstaff-like role of ""King-Of-The-Streets"" Bob.) It's a fascinating, touching and very successful blend of styles overall. The big themes (the search for love and belonging) are conveyed in a very interesting and genuinely moving manner. I particularly enjoyed the symbolism and pathos the film flittingly suggests. The performances are uniformly excellent, and this movie remains one of my all-time favourites. One of the greatest (and most unique) indie movies of the 1990's.",/review/rw1498082/?ref_=tt_urv

","Having liked/loved some of Gus Van Sant's other work (i.e. 'Good Will Hunting'), as someone who thinks that Keanu Reeves has given good performances in his career and who absolutely adores River Phoenix in 'Stand By Me' (one of the greatest child performances ever to me), as well as being intrigued by the story's themes, 'My Own Private Idaho' quickly went on my ever growing ""to see"" list.",/review/rw1498082/?ref_=tt_urv

5 December 2007,jazzpiano-,10," My Own Private Idaho
","Mike (River Phoenix) has narcolepsy, and whenever he feels super-stressed he suffers what I interpret to be attacks of cataplexy, that is, sleep triggered by heightened emotions. His friend, would-be lover and fellow male prostitute, Scott (Keanu Reeves), has a rich dad who's going to leave him a hefty sum when he turns 21. These two characters are the main focus of ""My Own Private Idaho"" which deals with common and uncommon themes, such as home, sexual identity and love. Van Sant throws in some Shakespearean language plagiarised straight from Henry IV and a non-linear narrative and you've got one very cute surrealist indie film.",/review/rw1498082/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2013,KineticSeoul,4," Gets boring as it progresses
","This is one of those movies that starts off promising but as it progresses it just gets weird and bizarre but just not in a good way. It had my interest at first with the introduction of the characters but after the introductions and a bit of bonding between two characters it just got boring. I think the part I lost interest is when River Phoenix's character is visiting his dad in a trailer. It's basically a depressing and bitter road movie about two gay or bisexual male prostitutes on a road trip. Because they both have mother and father issues that they have to deal with. I give River Phoenix's character some sympathy but not so much for Keanu's character. Maybe because one is more in a rut than the other. And none of the characters are likable in this movie, which is fine since when it comes to the tragedy. It didn't get all that depressing. But the relationship and bonding between these two characters played by River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves seemed authentic. Maybe because they were friends in real life. It's somewhat of a artsy flick and it's watchable but just didn't really entertain me or got my interest. It got weird and some of the characters gets pretty darn bizarre. But I guess it somewhat adds to the realism to a degree. This is the first movie I seen with River Phoenix and he basically owns this character. But maybe that is cause there is quite a lot of himself in this character. And Keanu...Well I never found the guy to be a brilliant actor. But he is somewhat versatile and fits right in usually with the role he is in. Overall, this movie through me off guard but not really in a good way. Plus I couldn't connect with any of the characters at all, although that may seem a bit conceited on my part.",/review/rw1498082/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2000,BridgetMarie77,," Updated Henry IV
","Gus Van Sant, truly one of the best directors in this century, has a visionary eye that enables audiences to see life in a different/new way. In this case he takes Henry IV- usually overshadowed by Henry V, and turns it in to a heart wrenching tale that modern audiences can appreciate. The visual pictures that get layered on and on and on our eyeballs are like dance steps carefully plotted. The use of lesser known actors is refreshing, and the chemistry between River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves is overwhelming. This is a must see for any lover of independent films, for any person tired of predictable plots, or for anyone who wants to open their heart to vulnerable characters and love them. This movie gets you involved.",/review/rw1498082/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2010,mjneu59,3," much ado about nothing
","A narcoleptic hustler and his 'degenerate' (to his father) pal travel the Pacific Northwest in search of¬Öwhat? Freedom? Affection? Adventure? Gus Van Sant's follow up to his career breakthrough 'Drugstore Cowboy' is full odd stylistic tics and transparent social commentary, all of it adding up to a merely pretentious film even more aimless and unmotivated than its two primary characters. Viewers might be forgiven for wondering where the story is going after the brief detour into Idaho itself (the trailer home reunion is a highlight), when the scene shifts abruptly, and for no good reason, to sunny Rome (yes, in Italy). There's plenty to look at, but all the gorgeous imagery hides a shortage of real ideas, and Van Sant's mock Shakespearean dialogue is an annoying conceit (at least the Bard is acknowledged in the credits). Udo Kier, as 'Hans', steals the film away from its two young stars, and the brief documentary appearance of actual teenage hustlers discussing their 'dates' shows what the film could have aspired to.",/review/rw1498082/?ref_=tt_urv

","I do like the weird movies but sometimes they can go to far. This one went to far. There was never a point where I got interested. I just sort of watched until it was over with. This is a low grade Magnolia. In Magnolia, I was interested in the characters and where things would end up. There were better performances and a better understanding of what was going on. Here, I didn't know what was going on and didn't care. There never really was a story or plot and there was nothing to get interested about. The only good consistent thing about this movie is River Phoenix's performance. If this movie had been better, he might have been nominated for an Oscar. River Phoenix is truly one of the greatest actors to die before his time. His story is tragic b/c of how great a talent he was, and how we were robbed of what other things he could have done before his untimely death. If you're a fan of Phoenix, you might like this, but it just doesn't come together for me. I like Van Sant, I like Phoenix, I just don't like this movie. It happens!

Gus van Sant did a great job and created a very artistic movie with many truths about life.Both River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves give wonderful performances.I read some other comments too on this board and I have to say that the story, is not only about 2 male prostitutes that sell their bodies for the money.Try to catch that underlying message that each viewer interprets it in his own way.In the way HE feels it.The movie gets really sad at the end but it makes you realize a lot of things.In this road of life that ""...goes around the world..."" you get hurt, betrayed, you believe, you hope, you pay, you earn, you lose, you win...that road never ends.",/review/rw1498082/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 1999,vogue-3,9," The greatest Gus Van Sant's movie
","In this amazing film there are a lot of symbolic images that are the keys to understand it. Mike Waters is a young drifter who works as a male prostitute. He has had a very difficult childhood because his mother was mentally ill and he discovers, but maybe he had always known, that his brother is his father. This is probably  the cause of his narcolepsy. He don't succeed in overcoming his past and the narcolepsy, making him fall suddenly asleep, takes him away from the real life and brings him in the life he always have dreamt, exactly his own private Idaho. In fact Mike, in the beginning and in the end of the film awakens on the street for the Idaho because this is the place where all is problems have starts and from which he has to restart if he wants to go on. The street is one of the symbolic images: he can decide to cross it, going on with is real life, or ramain at the point of starting.  Another symbolic image is that of leaping fish that try to sail up a stream that reflect just his impossibility to overcome his past. This film is surely the greatest Gus Vas Sant's one , one of my favourite director. A shocking drama of uncommon strength and beauty. The actors are the best they would have been, River Phoenix is superlative (this is his greatest performance too and I am very happy that he had been rewarded with the `Coppa Volpi' just in my country, Italy), Keanu Reeves gives also a good performance in a very complex role, Udo Kier gives  great charm and charisma to his character and James Russo a strong dramatic charge. The cinematography is excellent as well as the soundtrack through which song there is the beautiful Madonna's song `Cherish' that stress the Mike's search  of a person who loves him (who cherishes him), a man or a woman this does't matters. During the films all his hope seem to be shattered but the end of the film leaves an open door to different interpretations: Make falling asleep and being bundled into a car by a stranger¬Ö..he will finally go on and find a person that cares for him or he comes back again to Idaho?",/review/rw1498082/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2006,LuckyGraveyardBoots,7," poetic and beautiful, if a bit too avant-garde
","In a very un-epic way, this movie really gets to the heart of the loneliness at the center of our being. Somebody described it as ""tender but never sentimental"" which I think describes it perfectly. It tells the story of two teenage hustlers at a specific period in their lives. Mike (River Phoenix) is somewhat of an enigma. He is dreamy, gentle, and in love with his best friend. He is also, unfortunately, a narcoleptic, and is obsessed with finding his long-lost mother. Scott (Keanu Reeves) is his best friend, who is a rich boy and only prostitutes himself as a way to be rebellious and humiliate his father. A plot is somewhat secondary, since the movie is about the inner lives of its two main characters (given Reeves' acting talent, more like one main character) but there are a few points I will mention...an older homeless guy named Bob is also in love with Scott, although it's more of a father/son thing. In the scenes with Bob, Shakespearian dialogue straight out of Henry IV is used - and unfortunately, the story has the same turnout: Scott (Henry) comes into his fortune and reforms himself, refusing to associate with any of his old friends, and ultimately breaking Bob's (Falstaff's) heart in two, and he dies. Kenneth Branaugh pulled Henry off pretty well, in part because Henry's motives are unselfish (good of the country) whereas Scott is only concerned with money and himself. When Scott and Mike go to Italy to try and find Mike's mom, she's long gone, but Scott falls in love with an Italian girl (""Sorry Mike!"") and abandons his friend to a life of prostitution, completely alone. By the end of the movie, Scott is in a three-piece suit and Mike is fast asleep in the middle of a road in Idaho. The film does a great job portraying the unending loneliness in our souls that we attempt to break up by human relationships that never end up meaning anything. Every man is an island. It also conveys a sense of there only being the past - the future never seems to enter Mike's consciousness. Overall wonderful, although uneven and slow in parts. River Phoenix is not a great actor, but he was much better than I expected him to be. He seems like he's from another planet, but he's so sweet all the time and never seems to have any hatred in him - not even when Scott deserts him. He does a great job portraying the painful plight of the gay best friend...and the guy who played Bob was also pretty good. Not Keanu, though. Scott is supposed to undergo pretty radical character development, but Reeves just goes on AutoKeanu which really isn't too exciting to watch, all considered.",/review/rw1498082/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film is almost impossible to watch, and will only be praised by either jaded film critics or people feigning artistic understanding.

It is incredibly boring, pretentious, and fantastically frustrating. It also throws the whoring homosexual lifestyle of two losers back in your face, daring you to criticize the movie and thus be branded a homophobe.
