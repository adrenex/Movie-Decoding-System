","Amanda Bynes is so funny coming from ""All That"" and she is so charismatic and enjoyable to watch. This also spawned a spin-off sitcom called ""Drake & Josh"". So many good thins about this show.",/review/rw0686164/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2003,Ericho,," I don't care what some people think, I really liked this show
","I don't really like it how a lot of people here keep saying how this show is so terrible. I think it's a good show in my opinion. One of the best live-action Nick shows since ""Kenan And Kel"". Many of the skits entertain me, especially the ones with Mr. Gullible and the hilarious two ""Survivor"" spoofs. The first was everyone stuck in a car, the second was everyone stuck in a bathtub. It was so amusing to see which character would drive the others the most craziest. ",/review/rw0686164/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2003,jdarryls,," Remember, this show is for kids
","I am a bit surprised by some of the comments from users regarding this show. This show is meant to appeal to kids, and so it is not surprising that adults might not find it amusing.  Some of it is rather silly, but the show does have moments.  I am an adult, and sometimes watch it and I think the Judge Trudy sketches can be good, I especially like when she stands up for the kids, and punishes the parents for being idiots.  And of course when Judge Trudy shouts ""BRING IN THE DANCING LOBSTERS!""  Have some fun, and don't take things so seriously.",/review/rw0686164/?ref_=tt_urv

","Okay i realise i'm going to make myself very unpopular here just for my one line summary above, but i'm not going to let most of you say bad things about this show without saying why i think it ROCKS.  This sketch style of comedy isn't usually my scene but Amanda Bynes is the most hilarious teen i have ever seen.  She has the natural ability of being funny and a truckload of talent to go with it. When she does that hillbilly sketch i completely crack up.  Infact i have laughed till my stomach was so tight i thought i would die.  The only thing i don't like about the show is the segment on Moody's Point, it seems so dull and unfunny so i find myself channel hopping until that segment is over but the rest of the show is a total scream. Teenagers would prefer this style of entertainment to older people, i'm not a teenager but i never grew out of kids shows so i can still appreciate lighthearted comedy like The Amanda Show.  Amanda portrays many diffrent characters and i think she performs great in all of them but i especially like the character of Courtney with the glasses and huge teeth.  Courtney's appearance alone is enough to make me laugh and Amanda adds so much more to make Courtney even funnier than she already is.  I'm not surprised Amanda Bynes is moving on to bigger things like her part in Big Fat Liar and i'm sure that's just the start for her.  I'm looking forward to seeing alot more of Amanda in the future.",/review/rw0686164/?ref_=tt_urv

","Good grief! I can't believe all the negativity here. This show is hilarious! I am 34 years old and my husband is even older than me. We used to sit and watch it with our kids and we would all laugh so hard. We even recorded some episodes and watched them over and over. Anyone who says Amanda has no talent doesn't know what talent is. She is a gifted actress and comedian. Watching her show reminded me of watching the old Carol Burnett show when I was younger. Sure, some of the skits are silly no-brainers, but everything doesn't have to be deep. The Carol Burnett skits were the same way. Sometimes you just have to be silly! It is a silly show but it is fun and my whole family enjoyed it. We own the movie ""What a Girl Wants"" which we've watched many times. It is a better example of how funny Amanda is and what a great actress she is. She is a beautiful young lady with a great future ahead of her. The first time I actually saw her was on the movie ""Big Fat Liar"" and I remember telling my husband, that girl is going to go places. I hadn't seen the Amanda show at that time but we started watching it and loved it. If you haven't seen it, don't listen to these people, give it chance for yourself. MAAA HAAAAA",/review/rw0686164/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2002,CaptHayfever,7," Very good show. (Yeah, I know it's not my usual witty comment, oh well.)
","Amanda Bynes is well-deserving of her own show. She's improvisationally superb, comically hilarious, dramatically gifted, vocally versatile, physically agile, personally friendly, realistically down-to-earth, and absolutely beautiful.",/review/rw0686164/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2017,snperera,8," loove this show!
",my childhood! this show is my childhood! Amanda Bynes was a comedic genius in this movie! She was so great in this show and she has such energy in the show! She really wanted to entertain you and she wanted you to have a good time. I will always love this show because it had such simple jokes and skits like the homework hotline. The other actors in the show were great as well and they really gave their all. They were really funny and they seemed like they really wanted to entertain you as well and they wanted you to have fun. I will always love this show and it will always be a classic to me! I wish there were more kid shows like this nowadays. I feel like kids show nowadays try too hard to be funny and they aren't genuine or sincere.,/review/rw0686164/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2012,CourtneyRichardson24,10," My Childhood
","The Amanda Show stars Amanda Bynes and other known Nickelodeon stars from the 90s and 00s. The Amanda Show is a spin off show from All That and is just a Saturday Night Live for kids. I loved this show so much because it was so funny and yeah, as a 16 year old, it still is. I am devastated that they do not play these shows on Nickelodeon AU anymore and it disappoints me even more that they do not make shows like these and instead they make absolute slop like: Big Time Rush, House of Anubis, Back at the Barnyard etc. This is the same as Disney AU, they have terrible shows: Kick Buttowski, Fish Hooks, Pair of Kings etc. Even when they do put the decent shows on: That's So Raven, Suite Life of Zack and Cody (NOT SUITE LIFE ON DECK), Lizzie McGuire, they are all on at midnight. But the old Nickelodeon and Disney will always remain in my childhood!",/review/rw0686164/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2006,davies-13,1," Most Rancid Show Ever!!!
","This show is the most horrible, irritating show ever! I didn't think that actors or writers could stoop so low. The acting in this show is terrible, I didn't think that acting could be this bad but I was seriously wrong. The writers must have permanent writers block while writing this show, either that or they let their 2 year old child write it. And what was the creators thinking of! Sketch shows are mostly good, but Nickelodeon need to wake up for crying out loud! Their fan base is depleting rapidly as they still think that Rancid shows like this, their stupid commentary and those gross Nick logo ads they have (you know about bogey's, that kind of stuff) are still cool. My Baby sister is more Mature than Nickelodeon are. what happened to the Classic shows like 'Kenan & Kel' or 'Sabrina: The Teenage Witch'. I warn all of you that if this show comes on to get out a bucket of paint, use a paintbrush to put a bit on a wall...And watch it Dry!",/review/rw0686164/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2001,Victor Field,," ""Amanda please""... get better material!
","From the folks who gave Nickelodeon ""Kenan & Kel"" and ""Cousin Skeeter"" (and who used to be on ""Head of the Class,"" another comedy show that had potential but never really realised it), this sketch show doesn't really make me laugh very much - okay, I am several years too old for its target audience, but the care put into Nickelodeon's animated shows is absent here; surely the viewers deserve better than hackneyed and occasionally stereotyped skits like this? (The Blickbuster video store and the Hillbilly Moments are particularly tiresome.)",/review/rw0686164/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2000,Cyprus386,," Not horrible, could be better
","At least this ""All That"" spinoff is better than that OTHER spinoff, you know, ""Kenan and Kel"".  Amanda Bynes is truly talented.  She deserves her own show.  She's probably the funniest person to fall off the ""All That"" carousel.  I'm sure many people agree with me.  I'm always right about those things, having watched things like ""All That"" since they premiered. Amanda Bynes deserves better than ""All That"".  She finally got what she deserved.",/review/rw0686164/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2002,dootuss,," Have mercy on our souls. Amanda Bynes is the sign of the appocalypse.
","This has to be the most pathetic, unfunniest, and worst comedy show i've ever seen. Who was the moron at Nickelodeon who thought Amanda Bynes deserved her own show? The person should be getting his or her butt kicked around the room. The sketches were unfunny, (especially Hillbilly moment, and The girl's bathroom) and stupid. Amanda Bynes is truly the most obnoxious, and most annoying kid on the planet, next to the Olsen Twins. The writing is pathetic, and the writers themselves were probably 8 year olds or younger (who the heck thinks dancing lobsters is funny? That's just plain stupid!). I'm glad they ditched this crap. Amanda sucks, the sketches suck, and this show sucks! Avoid at all costs!",/review/rw0686164/?ref_=tt_urv

29 April 2000,JohnnyJohnHildegaard,," Unoriginal and Overbloated
","The Amanda show is another fruitless attempt to bring All That to it's peak performance.  I'm getting really sick and tired of Amanda Bynes.  She has potential, but she can't utilize it in this other heap of Nickelodeon garbage.  It doesn't have any good ideas, and the audience is laughing at cheesy and unfunny comedy.  I don't know why they like it.  I can make better stuff than this.  Please, turn off your television set if you're watching this show, you'll live to thank me.  Finally, this show has the worst sketches of them all: Hillbilly moment!?  Penelope Taynt!?  Judge Trudy!?  It screams unoriginal all over it.  Please, don't watch this show.",/review/rw0686164/?ref_=tt_urv

","This show was amazing! It was very funny and clever. It didn't do very well on Nick (*Shuder*) because it didn't talk to down kids, as with most of Dan Shinders shows (except Zoey 101...I'm not exaggerating when I say that is one of the worst shows ever created) But this show was great it also introduced the 2 of the most underrated personalities on kids show biz, Drake and Josh. The reason I don't give it all 10 stars is because it ha it's off sketches. But when they finally release it on DVD...pick it up! From the Dancing Lobsters to Amanda Please this show was the Arrested Development of kids shows...was canned too fast and was too smart for the room.",/review/rw0686164/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2020,NickSchedules,10," One of the funniest live-action Nickelodeon shows of all time
","While Dan (Schneider) produced All That, the first official show he created for Nick was the Amanda Show which first aired on October 16, 1999. It was a sketch show starting the then 13 year old Amanda Bynes. This was my one of my favorite live action shows growing up (and this was back when I could watch whatever show was on instead of limiting myself with the same shows), and watching clips from the show will prove my point. Let's talk about the best thing of the show. Amanda Bynes herself is one of the funniest actresses in show business. Every single sketch she's in are just priceless to watch and she never fails to disappoint me. After all she did came from All That and was a cast member between seasons 3-6 and she really deserved her own show the same way Kenan and Kel did. I really don't wanna talk about her life nowadays because it's just so sad seeing her suffer the same path as some Disney Channel stars has suffered. All I hope is for her to act again once she's normal. I want to entertained by her again. On another note, the first season had two cast members that we'll never seen again. One of them is a guy named John Kassir who actually voiced Raymundo on Rocket Power. The other is a black girl named Raquel Lee, and they didn't gave her that much memorable moments (she was overshadowed by Amanda). Also worth noting that if it wasn't for this show, we wouldn't even have Drake and Josh. Yes as you can see, 3 out of 5 cast members were part of the Amanda Show: the mom (Nancy Sullivan) and the boys themselves (Drake Bell and Josh Peck). They were obviously a lot younger back then and they both had high pitched voice. So all in all, we wouldn't have all of these Schneider produced shows if it wasn't for All That and the Amanda Show. Definitely worth a watch if you want to be entertained. Dan Schneider's magnum opus imo.",/review/rw0686164/?ref_=tt_urv
