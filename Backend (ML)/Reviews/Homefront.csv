17 January 2023,richardbooth-45596,10," One of the best pilot episodes I've ever seen.
",The pilot episode is one of the best pilots I've ever seen even surpassing that of the Walking Dead. The introduction gave clarity and showed the individual struggles people had to cope with. I'm really looking forward to seeing how they build the characters and how they develop the relationships and attempt to match that of the game.,/review/rw8843331/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,GIJoel6,8," ~""I think I'm gonna love you for a long, long time""~
","I'm not here to comment on the relationship to the video game this show is adapted from, I don't play games like that and don't know or care anything about them. From a purely cinematic point of view, this show is excellent thru the three episodes I have seen so far. Art direction and set decoration is superb, as is cinematography. Performances range from adequate to damn good. Writing is topnotch, I was not expecting much from a show with this one's premise -- I don't even bother watching any of the ""Walking Dead"" shows for that reason -- but the way in which they introduced the storyline, the various backstories, the human consequences and endurance of catastrophe, are all very well constructed and detailed, dialog is appropriately sparse yet nothing important is left out.",/review/rw8843331/?ref_=tt_urv

","""The Last of Us,"" the highly-anticipated HBO series based on the critically acclaimed video game of the same name, is a truly remarkable viewing experience that will leave you captivated from start to finish. The show expertly adapts the game's powerful storytelling and characters for the small screen, delivering a thrilling and emotionally charged journey through a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by a deadly fungus.",/review/rw8843331/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2023,movicus-63513,10," The Best Adaptation Ever Made in History!
","As a huge fan of The Last of Us games, I know these games through and through. I know the storyline and have immersed myself into the games. I know it all too well. So, when I heard The Last of Us series was in the works at HBO from Chernobyl creator Craig Mazin and The Last of Us creative director Neil Druckmann in 2020, I was so excited. They worked together to write and produce this project. I was nervous because I hope they would not to fail as in another video games like Resident Evil, Tomb Raider, Mortal Kombat, Doom, and more. Many video games always fail when adapted to television or movies because they don't respect the source material, and they just want to do their own thing. They just with the name for branding. That's why. But in, ""The Last of Us"", HBO did follow the source material well. I'm relieved! I watched the first episode of The Last of Us last night. It was the best video game adaptation I've ever seen! It was historic! It was the perfect episode! As I watched the series, I felt like I was back playing the game. The series was a wonderful balance of adding a more detailed backstory while maintaining the heart of the source material. I was impressed! Minor deviations are done very nicely. The cast is awesome and played their roles as they were in the game. To all the losers that who complained about how terrible Bella Ramsey is in the character portrayed as Ellie in the Last of Us; you are ignorant. Don't watch the series then, just go play the game and stay in the game and enjoy the character in the game all you want. It's so ridiculous! Open your mind! It's an adaptation! Bella did awesome in first episode. I can't wait to see how she does in the further episodes. Now I see All the Bella haters are very quiet today! Of course, incredible cinematography and awesome shots in the car and plane crash scenes. In my opinion those were the best scenes of the year! Lastly, it was everything I had hoped for as a The Last of Us fan. It was perfect, I am confident that this season is an already a masterpiece, I know this season isn't complete but I can tell it is an already masterpiece.",/review/rw8843331/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,raphaelmarcelino,," That's how you start a TV series!
","First of all, I'd like to make it clear that I'm writing this review having only watched the episode and never having played the game or researched anything about it.",/review/rw8843331/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,henrycoles9,10," HBO's best of all time
","The best of video games meets the best of TV. What a time to be alive! I can still remember that wonderful summer ten years ago when I watched a walkthrough of The Last of Us for the first time and I could not believe how astoundingly real and genuine it felt. And now watching Joel carry his Sarah out on the streets while surrounded by Infected all over again, that was a sight for a sore eye. Naughty Dog set a precedent, probably created a whole new genre in its own right when it made The Last of Us. Now it seems the sky is the limit for how video games can guide show business, magnificent art inspiring art.",/review/rw8843331/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,tjstarr-99199,," Good So Far, But Let's Not Rate Or Give High Praise At Least Until Season 1 Ends
","The Last Of Us is off to a good start, and as far as video game adaptations go this is a solid adaptation. So far. It's too early to call this a masterpiece or give it a high 9 or 10. You cannot watch the first act of anything an say it's immediately overall a masterpiece. Remember, this might all lead into the problems and character assassinations of The Last Of Us Part II. The Last Of Us will serve as a unique test. Will HBO and the creators listen to their audience and stick very closely to adapting Part I of The Last Of Us, but win fans overwhelmingly by deviating away from the events of The Last Of Us Part II? Hopefully, but it's far to early to tell.",/review/rw8843331/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2023,destiny_west,8," Two Episodes in - Fantastic
","I haven't played the game - though I was aware of it. I was still really looking forward to this screen adaption. Anything with zombies in it, and I'm excited. I wanted to wait till at least after watching the second episode before leaving a review, reason being that I didn't want it to be a case of the first episode being a fluke.",/review/rw8843331/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,danny-altered-natives,8," GREAT THIRD EPISODE. THERE IS NO LIBERAL AGENDA.
","My favourite episode so far. I really appreciated the writers fleshing out Bill and Frank, it kinda explained why Bill we met in the game was so grumpy and isolated but unlike the game the writers removed Ellie's interactions with grumpy old Bill, by removing him and giving him this beautifully tragic romance with Frank. I love what the writers did, but I really liked Ellie teasing Bill as he led them through the town and it never dawned on me in the game that Frank and Bill ever were lovers, watching the cutscenes now it seems more obvious (duh), for me Bill's tetchy nature barking at Ellie kinda overshadowed Frank's importance or the fact he was his 'partner' or that the Bill we met in game could ever be so tender and vulnerable. But after this episode I much prefer what the show did, it needed this element of humanisation to make it more than just another 'The Walking Dead'. The Last of Us as a game was as much a humanity play over a survival horror. So for me, I appreciated this episode and how moving it was.",/review/rw8843331/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,Sergei_Maruk,8," Overrated, but good
","I liked the first episode. It has decent atmosthere, good actors and decorations, however, the score is not honest.",/review/rw8843331/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2023,anaraguilar,7," It's definitely good, but not as special as they're making out to be
","Acting is great, I love the pace of the first episode and story line is good, but just a bit predictable with the whole immunity thing. I was hoping for a more exciting secret, but hey, I dont know anything about the game so maybe there is something more to that 14 year old.",/review/rw8843331/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2023,antide-42376,6," A major flaw
","This started out great. I have played the game and thought to myself that they were doing a fantastic job of making this into a gripping TV series. Well acted, very well filmed and obviously including a very high budget, I was gripped and thinking that this was going to be brilliant but then a major flaw occurred.",/review/rw8843331/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2023,hotmasamosir,8," Over-rated by Fanboys
","I liked the 2nd episode better than the Pilot as it had more intensity in the scenes. The atmosphere and ambient sound was especially good on home theatre systems so I do advise future virwing to use surround sound. I have never played the game and I can quitr easily say that if you inserted this into an episode of The Walking Dead, many viewers would simply see it as a branch of the story-arc.",/review/rw8843331/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,hifiman-62270,7," I think 9 plus is a bit rich.
",This started off really well. Well executed. Well acted. Some good tension( I'm only talking about episode 1 here) But then it just went the same way as so many other series. A talky drama stretched out to a longer than required pilot episode. It will go one of three ways....walking Dead were u just got bored with zombies . Killings. And nothing new. Revert back to the start of episode one and be tense and we'll made or just stretch into series after series of melodramatic drama that holds no interest. I have no idea about the game it is based from but please even I suspect the game is more action based than sobby drama based.,/review/rw8843331/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,skinzilla,6," Get a Grip People, it's not that good
","So far it's a fairly generic but acceptable plot. The infected are more comical than they are fearsome. The acting is decent, but not a single performance has stood out. They also screwed up by casting the most unlikeable young protagonist to grace the screen since Dave Batista's daughter in the zombie movie he did for Netflix. The action is almost non existent, which would be fine if there was interesting dialogue, character development or the plot advances. People are so quick to heap praise on mediocrity now, that it's ridiculous. Whether it be The Peripheral, Game of Thrones prequel, Wednesday, etc. They all are worthy of a watch, but these 9/10 ratings should be rare, but people just heap praise where it isn't deserved. It's a solid 6/10, but could earn a higher or lower score by season's end.",/review/rw8843331/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,UniqueParticle,10," Masterful
","One of the most engaging series, well directed, thrilling, and has a great soundtrack! HBO at again with a huge hit a perfect example of a series based off a video game that is incredible all around instead of something else that didn't do well. The Last of Us was bound to do well with the massive amount of fans and it helps that the same composer of the game is involved among others like the director and writer pretty sure even played the video game. I'm delighted that this already has a 9.5 that's a ground breaking rating and the everything about it I can tell is a triumph in phenomenal cinema!",/review/rw8843331/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2023,andypike-22859,5," Seen it all before zombie series
","Disappointing. It's not awful, and has its good points, but it borrows heavily off all the hundreds of zombie films / series that have come before and offers nothing new.",/review/rw8843331/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,andreriosorio,7," Too much hype, nothing special

2 February 2023,noxaman,4," I am not interested in the content of this show
","I wish I could tell you the specifics of how this show has failed, but I am not allowed to broach those topics on this website.

4 February 2023,ajp2012,6," Way overrated. Absolutely nothing special.
","The amount of reviews here saying ""it's the best thing I've ever seen"" is absolutely hilarious and after the pilot episode everyone decided it was worthy of a 10/10 rating, which it is definately not. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with it as such, other than Ellie being probably one of the most irritating child characters ive seen, but there is nothing at all about the first 3 episodes that particularly stands out. Everything I've seen so far is just average and generic for this type of plot. We've seen it all before, which I have nothing against, but it is no where near as good as people are making out.",/review/rw8843331/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2023,normanhouse-15423,4," Really struggled with this
","I watched three episodes and it was a real struggle. I can't say how close it was to the game, because I've never played it. Is it a bit like every other zombie like series/film? Maybe. But that's not my problem with it. The plot is thin, the acting a bit wooden and not entertaining or intriguing. It needs to be one of the two.",/review/rw8843331/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2023,pensacolacomputer,2," Wow...really?
","As a gay guy I can say that we didn't ask or want this. We weren't looking for representation in every show. They had a complete story to go by, but no, they had to completely change everything. Why HBO? Why?",/review/rw8843331/?ref_=tt_urv
