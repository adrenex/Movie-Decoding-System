10 June 2000,jaws!,," Underrated
","To me this one is a lot better than the third one, and just about as good as the original. I don't understand why people don't like this movie. Bob Uecker is as funny, if not funnier than he was in the original. Randy Quaid (hey vile thing) is hilarious as an obsessed Indians fan who turns anti-fan. The new characters are very funny and wacky. Also The game at the end is thrilling. All in all underrated, and just about as good as the original. I give Major League II *** out of ****",/review/rw3873469/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2006,Smells_Like_Cheese,6," I thought there were just as many laughs and it was a decent sequel
","I don't know why the harsh rating, I mean, despite the fact that a few actors were replaced, I thought that Major League 2 was a decent comedy. Separated from the first, I think more people would give it a chance. How could you not laugh at the buddist out fielder? He was hilarious! I liked how they showed that most of the guys changed, it was so human and added a real story.",/review/rw3873469/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2010,Aaron1375,5," This baseball film is not as fun as the original.
","I have to say that for the most part this movie is a lot like the first film. However, now instead of a R rated movie with some bite it is a PG-13 flick that just is not as funny as the original. Also, this film is missing Wesley Snipes as he is replaced by Omar Epps which he would have been okay had he been in the first one, but after seeing Snipes in the role I did not really care for the recast. The team is back, apparently after their magical run they got knocked out very quickly in the playoffs. Somehow, Roger Dorn now owns the team and he paid way to much for it, he also brought in this free agent catcher to knock in some runs. Well that backfires as does a lot of things as Ricky the wild thang is now throwing garbage and can not get his 100 mph fastball in gear, Pedro has mellowed to a considerable degree, Jake Taylor ends up one of the managers on staff and all is not right with the world. There are some funny scenes here and there, but the original it is not. Not only are some characters simply not in the film, like Eddie the aging pitcher, some are back and just not like themselves like Dorn who seems to be playing a completely different character. The film focuses more on Charlie Sheen as Ricky and he has some funny moments as does Randy Quaid as a disenfranchised fan. Still, it probably would have been best had they not made this sequel, it is surprising they made one more after this, but I do not think that one did anything at the box office.",/review/rw3873469/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2005,Tecun_Uman,9," It is a very worthy sequel
","This movie did not have the budget or the star power of the first one, but it made up for it with sharper writing and more creative characters. The real delight of this second chapter was that of Randy Quaid, whose tortured Indians fan character was just great. Exit Wesley Snipes, enter Omar Epps, who upholds the character of Willie Mays Hayes. Charlie Sheen is given more range and better punchlines, while the character of Jack Parkman infuses a much needed new enemy into the storyline. In fact, it is David Keith's Parkman that really makes the movie. I really feel that this film kept the series at the same level as the first, if not actually bringing it up a bit. Of course the third was really bad. So, don't be nervous that this will be another ""sorry sequel"", it really is quite good.",/review/rw3873469/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2000,michaelRokeefe,," Where can winners be losers and losers be winners?
","I am usually not much on sequels, and it is hard to tell if this time out the Cleveland Indians are much better off. ""Wild Thing"" is back, but with a cleaned up look. Jake Taylor is back as a coach helping Manager Lou Brown guide the misguided. Roger Dorn is back with an even larger ego. Announcer Harry Doyle is outspoken as ever, but I think he made a bigger impact in the first movie.",/review/rw3873469/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2011,StevePulaski,5," Almost strikes out, but saved by a few minor perks
","Major League II is a lost cause at best. It's one of those films you know will have a sequel, but you don't want there to be a sequel. You want the film to leave off on a good note and not be inhabited by sequels of lesser quality. Instead, Major League did what was predicted and made a sequel that is (a) PG and not on par with the original and (b) doesn't include all of the original actors.",/review/rw3873469/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2003,kingklassy,," Separate it from the original and it's not as bad as some make it out to be...
","Okay, the original ""Major League"" (1989) was a great movie and the surprise hit of 1989. So, it's no surprise that not only did they want to sequelize it, but that they toned the humor down to PG level to reach a wider audience. Unlike alot of other sequels, most of the original crowd is back (including Charlie Sheen as Rick Vaughn and Tom Berenger as Jake Taylor), save for Wesley Snipes, whose role of Willie ""Mays"" Hayes is reprised by then-up-and-coming Omar Epps (who pokes fun at Snipes' then-rising career as an action film star in a very funny sequence with Jake Ventura).",/review/rw3873469/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2005,Shadow_Fish,7," While by no means brilliant, fun for those who enjoy stupid humor
","And I mean really stupid humor. By no means does this realistically portray baseball, nor does it make any sense at all in real life. It's just stupidly funny. In movies like this, I personally don't really care how good the acting is or how corny the plot is (cheesy romance, ridiculous comebacks, etc) so long as it remains interesting. Yes, most people would know what's going to happen from the beginning. It's what happens when getting there that's funny. While not a must-see movie, if you like comedy and you don't have much else to do, I would recommend watching it. If you prefer witty humor or more winding plots (a la Seinfeld) or developed characters, this is definitely not good for you. This might be even better for baseball fans. A very nice movie to unwind with.",/review/rw3873469/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2004,JABrown,6," Not as bad as some say

27 June 1999,Coxer99,," Major League II
","Poor follow up to the 1989 hit comedy with most of the original players returning, with the exception of Snipes. (His role was played by Omar Epps here.) Uecker still has the best lines and the best scenes. Quaid continues his string of idiot roles as a bitter, drunk fan. Followed by yet another sequel in 1998.",/review/rw3873469/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2013,SanteeFats,8," Good enough
","Not nearly as funny as Major League this is still a decent enough sequel. To9m Berenger is back as the almost washed up catcher and team leader. Charlie Sheen is back as Wild Thing, the heat throwing pitcher. Unfortunately he has become extremely corporate in his actions and his image. This is due to a marketing ploy to increase his marketability quotient. Towards the end he returns to reality and to his successful on field persona dumping the agent and her requirements. I really like the character of the manager played by Gammons. I don't know if it is just his voice and mustache but his presence his powerful. Alison Doody is back as the ogre of an owner and does it well. David Keith has a almost minor role as an irascible mercenary slugger. He gets his comeuppance when Sheen strikes him out to win the game. Dennis Haysbert is very good as the voodoo worshiping (?), superstitious, and now a pacifistic do gooder who gives it up when he realizes it doesn't work for him. Omar Epps replaces Wesley Snipes and while I like both actors Snipes was better as Willie Mays Hayes. The appearance of Tanaka is a nice touch and his samurai(?) principles eventually brings Cerrano out of his funk.",/review/rw3873469/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2002,leif.hellstrom,," Seamless
",This may not be a great movie but it is excellent craftmanship. The acting is uniformly good and relaxed and the cinematography simple but efficient. The story may be similar to the first film but it is not a copy and is quite OK for a Sunday afternoon type film.,/review/rw3873469/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2017,lovintennis,7," As hilarious as the first!!!!
","I would've rated higher but just because it's hilarious doesn't mean it's excellent. One of my gripes about this one is how Willie Hayes' ambition to go deep and the Skipper's disapproval was simply used all over again. Willie tried to be hot stuff in the first and Lou scolded him, explaining his job is to get on base, not hit homeruns, to which he responded, ""Hey :), no problem :)!"" For THIS one, he buffed up over the winter and is trying to be Babe Ruth again, and LOU, AGAIN, has the same talk with him as if they didn't go through that already in the FIRST movie. The climax is so totally ridiculous and unrealistic: no manager would ever allow the scenario at the end. If he did, regardless of whether it turns out successfully, he'd be fired and wouldn't be picked up by any other club.",/review/rw3873469/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2013,richard-1787,2," Don't bother, even if you liked the first movie

9 May 2019,mrdestroyer2001,6," Major League 2: Back to basics
","This sequel raises a rather urgent problem. We are talking about sports ""satiety,"" professional stagnation, and even a banal change of reference points in the career of our heroes. ""Savage"" Vaughn instead of his acclaimed ""bitnichesky"" lifestyle, we see an elegant young man in a black business suit, who, under the influence of his agent, gradually loses himself to the present and is no longer devoted to his business with the same zeal. Quick and easy, Hayes (unfortunately, not performed by Wesley's old days, Omar Epps replaced him here) is more concerned with his film career than with jerks on the field. Yes, and veteran Jack Taylor over the years, not younger, and already somewhere in the thoughts of a well-deserved ""sports retirement."" And how to unite a scattered team, in which everyone is for himself, and puts his own interests higher than the interests of the collective? Yes exactly. It's time to remember how it all began. It's time to go back to basics ...",/review/rw3873469/?ref_=tt_urv

3 December 2017,Uriah43,5," Didn't Quite Have the Same Energy as its Predecessor
","Having come from out of nowhere to win the Eastern Division last season, the Cleveland Indians have most of their main players back and plan to repeat their success this season. In addition, they have also acquired a veteran catcher by the name of ""Jack Parkman"" (David Keith) and a rookie at the same position named ""Rube Baker"" (Eric Bruskotter) to replace ""Jake Taylor"" (Tom Berenger) who has moved to a coaching spot. Not only that but their insufferable previous owner ""Rachel Phelps"" (Margaret Whitton) has sold the franchise to their aging third baseman ""Roger Dorn"" (Corbin Bernsen). That said, things are apparently looking good and all of the experts predict that they will go all the way to the World Series. However, things aren't necessarily as good as they seem as the players they counted on have all lost their spark and to make matters even worse Roger Dorn overestimated his investment and has had to resell the team to--of all people--Rachel Phelps. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film turned out to be a somewhat routine sequel in that it simply didn't quite have the same energy as its predecessor. I especially didn't care for two of the characters by the names of ""Isuro Tanaka"" (Takaaki Ishibashi) and the obnoxious fan named ""Johnny"" (Randy Quaid) who were quite annoying. Even so there were a couple of good moments here and there and having an attractive actress like Alison Doody (as ""Rebecca Flannery"") certainly didn't hurt. All things considered then, while it wasn't a great film by any means, I suppose it wasn't necessarily that bad and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",/review/rw3873469/?ref_=tt_urv
