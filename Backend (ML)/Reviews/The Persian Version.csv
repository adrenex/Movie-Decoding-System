14 June 2003,stamper,8," They don't make movies like that anymore
","You probably think the one line summary of this comment is a bit strange, since The Road to El Dorado isn't in fact that old, but what I meant by it is that they do not make feature films like this anymore. Sure every now and then there is a great animated film that revives the Adventure genre of film-making, but that's basically it. If you're an adventure freak like I am and you simply love Indiana Jones or Stargate or The Mummy for all I care you should definitely watch this film. I bet you'll enjoy it, disregarding your age (although very small kid's might get frightened at times). Thank you Dreamworks for providing me with a fantastic story of adventure. I appreciate it. It's been so long since I've seen any good adventure (The Mummy was last and Indy before that).",/review/rw3082800/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2013,MissSimonetta,7," Like The Emperor's New Groove, this is underrated
","The Road to El Dorado (2000), an animated cult film if there ever was one. It's interesting to compare this flick to Disney's The Emperor's New Groove (2000), which came out the same year. Both are traditionally animated. Both are wickedly funny. Both underperformed at the box office. While Emperor has gone on to be one of the most beloved modern Disney films, El Dorado is still only a cult film. That's a real shame, because it's a fun ride with snappy dialogue and cool characters.",/review/rw3082800/?ref_=tt_urv

27 August 2006,demonelipso,10," One of my favorites...
","One of the few more-modern animated films I still enjoy; maybe that's because it doesn't happen to revolve around ""The power of friendship/love/whatever"" and isn't some sappy love story, like many of Disney's drek has been (though it does have a minor, slightly sleazey love-ish story in the background). Dreamworks is a breath of fresh air in times like these, it would seem.",/review/rw3082800/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2001,Alcaminhante,," Disney take notes, THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT people !!
","First TITAN A.E., now EL DORADO. I canÂ´t believe another brilliant animation movie was trashed down by the critics. Trully unbelievable, specialy after inferior works, (in plot or character development) like TARZAN were a big sucess. Marketing realy is a powerfull thing...and being politicaly correct apparently still determines a sucess in the States.",/review/rw3082800/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2001,Elfie-5,8," A great movie for grown up animation fans
","I watched this movie with my younger brother (who is in his late teens) and we both loved it. This movie, and Titian AE, are part of an interesting new trend- animated films that appeal to teens and adults. I was stuck by how much this movie wasn't for little kids- the whole Tulio/Chel relationship notably- but since I'm not a parent, I don't have to be bothered by that. I got the impression that this movie was animated only because it is easier(ok, cheaper) to draw the elaborate settings than it would have been to constuct sets that showed as rich a setting. My only qualm with the movie is the awful musical numbers that all animated films insist on having in them- why do they all strive to be musicals? But all in all, it's a great movie. If you too find yourself drawn to such shows as Batman Beyond, you might appricate this animation that isn't geared towards small children.",/review/rw3082800/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2000,qball_82,7," The Road to El Dorado...hooked from start to finish.
","What can I say?  The Road to El Dorado kept me hooked right from the very start, proving to be an amazing adventure filled with action, comedy, color, breath-taking imagery and music. After The Prince of Egypt, I wasn't too keen on another Dreamworks animated film.  Don't ask me why, but Prince of Egypt just failed to reel me in.  El Dorado on the other hand has restored my faith in the studio.",/review/rw3082800/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2010,TheLittleSongbird,8," Visually audacious and fun film
","The Road To El Dorado is a fun film from Dreamworks. Is it the best Dreamworks film? No, I don't think it is as evocative or as stirring as Prince of Egypt, as zany or as (quite) original as Shrek, as witty or as charming as Antz, as ambitious or as mature as Spirit or as audacious or as sweet as Over the Hedge. But is it the worst Dreamworks? No, I was disappointed with Shark Tale, which was nice visually but suffered from a meandering script and an unoriginal plot line, and I think it is better than Shrek the Third, which felt tired in comparison to its first two predecessors.",/review/rw3082800/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2003,rbverhoef,8," The Man Who Would Be King
","Let me start by saying that I liked 'The Road to El Dorado'. It has some nice songs, good animations and it was very funny. I especially liked the horse Altivo. The thing that bothered me is that most of the things on screen I had already seen in other movies. Well, one in particular. Two guys come to a strange place. They are mistaken for Gods because a miracle happens by accident. They have a plan to steal the gold in that place, but one of them wants to stay. This is 'The Road to El Dorado' but also 'The Man Who Would Be King' from 1975 starring Sean Connery and Michael Caine. Here we Tulio and Miguel voiced by Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh. They have the same funny chemistry as Connery and Caine had. In 'The Road to El Dorado' we have also a love interest, Chel (voice by Rosie Perez), and a high priest named Tzekel-Kan (voice by Armand Assante) who doubts the divinity of the two men. I liked it, but not because it was very original. If you haven't seen 'The Man Who Would Be King' you are able to enjoy this movie also for the story. Anyway, you will not be bored.",/review/rw3082800/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2019,mattxrt,7," Very underrated

1 April 2000,Dkish,7," Watch out Mickey, Dreamworks is one step behind.
","As a new non-Disney animated film debuts I always find myself asking will we ever have one that can match Disney's musical timing and humorous tone. ""The Road to El Dorado"" is one of those that comes really close to being as brilliant as Disney. The films title talks about a path that leads to the mysterious Mayan ""City of Gold"". This myth has been passed down for hundreds of years. In the 1500's a lot of Spanish conquistadors went to the New World in search of this city after it seemed to be impossible to find the ""Fountain of Youth"", the other mythical discovery. This legend was screaming to be a fantasy film. In the Dreamworks interpretation of this legend, we follow the misadventures of two con-artists (voiced by Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Kline) who accidentally win a treasure map in a craps game. When the game goes sour, the cons hide out in some barrels and end up on a boat bound for the New World. To their bad luck the boat happens to be captained by the most famous of the Spanish conquistadors, Cortez. Thrown in the depths of the ship by Cortez, our two heroes plan their escape. Without spoiling anymore of the film, the two end up in the New World to follow their map. The Dreamworks animators deliver lush rich scenery and delightful characters. These characters and scenery were a lot like the brilliance found in Disney's ""Jungle Book"" and last year's amazing ""Tarzan"". If you remember back to ""Prince of Egypt"" we had that magnificent look and the celebrity voices but no real memorable relationships. The intricate relationships between the characters in this film is one more step ahead forward Dreamworks. But what the film lacked was a real memorable song. The team of Elton John and Tim Rice, who dreamed up the brilliant soundtrack of the ""Lion King"", really never deliver a solid song that your kids will be singing weeks after the film. The songs here really have no heart but instead just play during some of the weaker scenes of the film. Now all they have to do is deliver musical songs and a musical score we will want to listen to after the film closes. Disney still reins supreme as head animation studio. But watch out Mickey, Dreamworks is one step behind. (4 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.",/review/rw3082800/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2005,kmaloney7659,10," Greatest animated film ever!
","First things first, I am 56 years old and I have to say that I adored this movie. It didn't seem childish or silly at all, on the contrary it had language and dialogue that my 6 year old grandson wouldn't understand! The plot was exciting, the characters deep. Towards the end when I thought that Tulio and Chel were leaving Miguel for good, tears sprang into my watery blue eyes. I almost couldn't stand it! The part in which the chief played ball with the village children was so adorable! The movie wouldn't be complete without it.",/review/rw3082800/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2013,StevePulaski,8," It has a spirit and a heart, and those are two of the hardest things to achieve in animation
","The Road to El Dorado was birthed during the period where Dreamworks was still getting started, per say. After releasing the deeply sophisticated Antz and the cult favorite The Prince of Egypt, moviegoers still really had no true idea of what kind of film the company would give them. If Antz was sophistication, then The Road to El Dorado is anarchy - the coherent and easily-lovable kind. Filled with catchy, spur-of-the-moment songs, bright stylistic animation, and an immersing storyline, it majors in the field of uncompromising fun.",/review/rw3082800/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2006,MeloDee,8," A rather good film.
","There is nothing much that is bad that is to be said about this film. The characters, Tulio and Miguel, were fun, entertaining, and the plot itself was much the same way. I was surprised, however (though not necessarily disappointed), at how Disney-like this movie was, coming from Dream Works. Dream Works tends to go for a more ""crude"" or ""sarcastic"" humor. They don't seem to like using two scrawny, goofy men as main characters or having an antagonist that is so evil that you can hardly express how evilly evil he is. Both of these were present in the movie, as well as a scene where Tulio and Miguel *gasp* dance and sing! Verrrrry Disney-like if you ask me.",/review/rw3082800/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2000,prohibited-name-1019,8," A winner.
","This is the best animated movie (rated PG-13 or lower) since The Lion King. The story seems a bit rushed, but it is entertaining.  And the animation simply breathtaking.  The soundtrack is another winner for Elton John and the songs he performs add depth to the story.",/review/rw3082800/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2015,mistoppi,7," Was my favourite as a kid and after all these years it's still excellent
","It's not surprising why so many people loved The Road to El Dorado, whether they were a kid or an adult. The Road to El Dorado charms you right in the beginning. Even if you usually hate songs in animated films, the music of this one is amazing. And they don't ruin the dialogue by turning a conversation to a song (Apart from It's Tough to be a god, but that song was so good it didn't even matter). Instead they are planted in scenes where no words are spoken. It works very well, and is a lot better than characters singing.",/review/rw3082800/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2001,Wildkatt,8," Great movie, but not for young kids.

10 May 2000,tedg,," Sergeant Pepper Meets West Side Story
","The old TV show `Sky King' spent half its time on the adult hero flying around with the adolescent Penny scouring the landscape, with her periodic reports that she saw nothing interesting. I feel this way when I go to these mundane time-fillers. But there are a few layers worthy of attention we can see from a height.",/review/rw3082800/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2004,george.schmidt,," Animated Hope & Crosby homage
","THE ROAD TO EL DORADO (2000) **1/2 (Voices: Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, Rosie Perez, Edward James Olmos, Armand Assante, Jim Cummings, Frank Welker).  Second big-screen animated tale from SKG/DreamWorks with Disney echoes about 16th century Hope/Crosby set up with two con artists who wind up on the path to the mythical jungle city of gold en route w/Cortez and finding that there's more than meets the eye (individuality and friendship are more important than all the wealth they discover). Kline and Branagh do their best in low-key, sly witty banter and Perez provides enough feistiness to keep things afloat including the by-the-numbers forgettable musical numbers by Elton John and Tim Rice.

18 September 2015,C22Man,8," The Road to......
","The premise of The Road to El Dorado is nothing new. Two con artists, one a schemer and the other a dreamer, find their way to the ancient city of El Dorado where the locals mistake them for Gods. What sets it apart is if it can take advantage of this premise with enjoyable characters and good jokes, and El Dorado certainly does that. It knows just when to deliver the comedy, capitalise on the films adventurous aspects and when to let the characters breathe.",/review/rw3082800/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2014,rcolgan,8," An adventurous and funny nostalgic classic
","Some people often try comparing Dreamworks features to that of their biggest competitor Disney. Sometimes those comparisons are worthwhile with the likes of Antz and Bugs Life, but for the most part Dreamworks always create their own style of fun. One of the best films at showing this is Road to El Dorado, with a unique setting and a sense of adventure unlike any put to animation before.",/review/rw3082800/?ref_=tt_urv
