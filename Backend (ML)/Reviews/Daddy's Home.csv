8 February 2000,macblanc,," Great for Toddlers
","Upon perusing some of my, and my daughters' favourite t.v. programmes, I came upon a rather nasty review of The Big Comfy Couch, right here on IMDB. Unfortunately, the writer doesn't ""get"" the idea behind the show.",/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2002,tollbaby,," Kids *LOVE* this show!
","I don't know how long this show has been running, but I hope Loonette lasts until my kids are too old to watch. I have a 3.5 year old and a 1 year old, and they are rivetted to the tv during this show.",/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2002,bobbyknightmare,," A promising show that got no respect
","It's sad that Allison Court is going to be known more for doing the voice of Jubilee on ""X-Men"" (yes, that's her!) than for this show, which is one of dozens of promising and solid children's shows that never got enough of a chance to catch on. Maybe in its native Canada it gets more respect, but here on the other side of the falls, an educational show is judged more by how much merchandise it sells than how much children learn from it.",/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2001,erka_bean,," Greatest!
","I don't have children and I'm not 6 months old.  I'm 15 and one day I was flipping through and saw this show.  I was hooked.  I don't watch ""kidz shows"" but this is great.  It's nothing like Teletubbies b/c more goes on and more is learned for younger viewers because there arent as many repetetive actions.  It does teach things like values, creativity, uniquiness, and it's okay if Molly has an ""accident"" on the couch.  You have to read deeper.  Everything in the show represents something, obviously the children dont recognize this symbolism but the idea comes accross very well to them.  This show is brilliant!!",/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2003,allie1962,," This is a wonderful show which should be brought back!
","I find this to be a wonderful show, I can find it on my local PBS station on Saturdays at 8 am. My almost 4 yr old daughter has enjoyed this program since she was under a year old. The should bring it back and try it for another season. It must be good if kids are enjoying it a decade later!!!",/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2006,OmegaWolf747,10," Great for adults too
","True, this is geared toward children, but as a teenager and well into my 20s, I adored this show. It was so simple, yet so funny. I loved the repetition of it as well. Every episode would start with Loonette and Molly waking up on the couch, Loonette does her stretch, then she and Molly go outside and chat with Granny Garbanzo and Major Bedhead who always comes by with a package from Aunty Macassre. After that, she and Molly go inside and read a story, then Loonette cleans up her mess and it's off to bed. There are also daily cameos by the Dust Bunnies whom only Molly knows about. Loonette doesn't believe they exist.",/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2002,jwrowe3,," Not So Bad.....
","PERSONAL NOTES: I probably first saw this about 1996, with my then four year old daughter, Melissa.",/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2003,kellyirene2001,," Man, this was a cute show
","I wonder why it was cancelled.  Man, when I was a little girl, I loved this show.....  Mollie the doll was so cute.  I was always asking my mom for a Mollie doll.  There were some cute puns in it, too.  It was adorable. Even though I'm not 5 years old anymore, I still miss it.",/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2003,starbright2000,," A GREAT SHOW FOR KIDS & A GREAT RESOURCE FOR TEACHERS!
","I could not agree more with the comments that say this is a great show for preschoolers and toddlers.  Heck, even primary age children would learn the wonderful values of this show.  And that's the key point - VALUES!  The show's primary theme is VALUES!  But, if you watch it with your children regularly as I do, then you would also see that it does have education with ABC's, CHECK IT OUT (science & discovery), and, most importantly) morals, manners, and values.  How can you go wrong.",/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2007,samantha_shopping2010,10," I loved this show
",I am a 15 year old girl and I was looking taking quizzes online and saw one that was based on how well you know the t.v. show The Big Comfy Couch. At first I was like...the big comfy couch?? what kind of little kid show is that?? and then the theme song just popped into my head...and I remembered that I have a doll from that show and now I wonder where it is..but I really wanted to watch it again for some reason so I got on YouTube and watched an episode and wondered if the show even aired anymore. So I got on here and I guess it does. So maybe if I am ever at home and awake..I'm going to watch it.,/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2007,chaneski,8," It really is a classic
","I can appreciate the other commenter's point of view, but I would exhort him to not be so despairing. While it's not on the level of Sesame Street or Captain Kangaroo, The Big Comfy Couch sits solidly within a different circle of ""classic"" shows. These are shows that, although they have not entered the consciousness of the general public, are very well done and have become personal favorites among many, many children. The Big Comfy Couch is nearly 15 years old and even the original Alyson Courtepisodes are still being rerun all over the place, because they are-good-. I can assure you that there are 20 year old college students all over North America, with fond memories of The Big Comfy Couch, who do a ""Ten Second Tidy"" of their dorm room each day.",/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2002,desmei,," Fun stuff for kids!
","This is one of my 3 year old daughter's favourite programs, and I gladly encourage her to watch it. It's a cute little show that encourages activity (the ""clock"" stretch, dancing), storytelling, friendship, etc. while addressing common fears and concerns of small children. I like the Foley family, too! :o)",/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2019,NumberOneComfyCouchFan,10," My childhood, the best parts
","I fricking love this show and have for almost 30 years. I love all the characters, storylines and wholesome adventures. I had a Molly doll in the 90s. It was the coolest dang toy, ever. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to remind folks about the nostalgia",/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2004,Broktun,," unique, fun, kids show
",The Big Comfy Couch was on Maryland's PBS when my first daughter was born. A much better show than the kid fare norm.,/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 1999,Goon-2,," crazy kids show
","By the time this aired I was much to watch children's shows and take seriously, but I had heard comments about this show that made it sound so bizarre I just HAD to watch. Needless to say, I found this one impossible to take seriously and realized that I probably would not have been able to do so as a child. How can ANYBODY?",/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv

12 October 2006,toddrandall68,6," Not much to this show
","This show is not really very good. Granny Garbanzo is annoying as heck, and Major Bedhead is a waste. Molly the Dolly is really cute. I just wish she would speak. Loonette is pretty good. The old Loonette (Alyson Court) was really good but the new Loonette (Ramona Gilmour-Darling) is as good if not better than the first one. I really don't have much to say about this show because I really don't like it, but my kids do. The first Loonette was better at the clock stretch than the newer Loonette. The newer Loonette seems to be struggling to do the stretches. But, what do I know? I am going to finish out this line and then go. There, that is 10 lines. The rule here used to be 3 lines. At one of the other movie sites it is just 10 words. Oops, this is going to be 11, no 12 lines.",/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2003,almdudler,," Lame show with poor production value
","I have to disagree with many of the other posts, so many of which come from the show's originating country of Canada, interestingly enough. (A little national pride on the line perhaps?) Well, your options may be somewhat limited in the Great White North, but here in the States, there's simply no reason to show your child tripe like the Big Comfy Couch with so many superior options available. My daughter watched it on Sunday mornings a couple times; thankfully, it's the only time slotted by our local PBS station. Just because a toddler or small child is entranced by a show does not make it a good show (see Teletubbies and Barney for indications of this). It has the look and feel of something a family might produce in their basement for fun - hokey-looking characters with the requisite hand puppets. The worst part for me, however, is the music. It's cloying and amateurish, which really sets it apart from other PBS programs that are of obviously higher quality. I feel like wretching at least once during every episode- you can count on at least one cheesy slapstick incident where Major Bedwetter, er Bedhead, falls down, or Loonette will stare at the camera like a ditz, seemingly filling time with her clueless schtick. My least favorite of all is the doll ""Molly"". Little Molly has all the charm of that doll ""Chucky"" from the horror flicks. She sits there squirming on the couch, never making a peep. You just wonder when she's going to pull a hunting knife out of that couch and put an end to Loonette's pathetic commentary. Am I being overly harsh on the show? If this was the 70's perhaps. But as a discriminating consumer with so much to choose from, I'm glad I can offer my daughter shows that entertain AND educate.",/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2000,macgeek,," Addicting for toddlers, not so much so for adults....
","My 23 month old daughter managed to catch the last 5 minutes one night, and she was hooked right away - rather scary if you ask me. She constantly wants to watch ""Molly"", even if it's 6:30 am (it airs at 17:00 here). While the show doesn't seem to have any redeeming educational qualities (just like the ""Teletubbies""), it does keep my daughter engaged (just like the ""Teletubbies""), so I figure it can't be all bad.",/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2005,sohelpmegod13,," I used to watch this show all the time...
",I also think that the show should be brought back. I used to watch it all the time as a kid! I really think it's a good way to teach kids wrong from right and how to clean up after themselves. It's good that they learn it early so they're used to doing it growing up. It's also a good inspiration for using your imagination. Kids need that. If they couldn't imagine things then they would just be bored all the time and they would lead a boring life. I remember when I was about 2 or 3 i used to make a mess and clean it up really fast just like Loonette. It might not be effective for that long but at least they get the point! I really hope the show is brought back. I'm sure even I would watch it again!,/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2006,aabisio,," Great Show, too bad Alyson is gone
","This is a show my 2 year old and I really enjoy together. Anyone who says it is pointless is not looking very hard, or does not possess a child's heart. Values such as friendship, responsibility and self-reliance are trademarks of this imaginative show. It's too bad that some viewers don't recognize these trademarks of a good show. Sorry if you lost the child within. Don't spoil it for everyone else. Having said that, it was with a significant amount of sadness that we discovered in the last week that Alyson Court had been replaced as Loonette. The new actress I'm sure is trying very hard, but simply does not hold a candle to Alyson. Our thanks to Alyson for her unique portrayal of Loonette. You will be missed. We are hoping to find DVDs of earlier episodes.",/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2011,ravyn_moore,," A Perfect Show! :)
","At Goon-2, I think the fact that this was written for 3-year-olds I am hardly surprised that they didn't hire a Leonardo Da Vinici to draw out the little dolls thoughts (Molly). The idea of the show is not to educate but to entertain. Small children enjoy brightness, simplicity, and silliness. Clowns are enjoyed by most children so therefore kids enjoy watching ""normal"" people with crazy clothes and big red noses. Also what adults find ignorant, or obnoxious, children find amusing and comforting. I, being 14, still love this show and remember watching it through out my childhood so pardon my saying that this show may be a bit out there to us, its perfect or kids. And as was said not every show children watch need to be educational, kids are kids and they need a treat every once in a while :) ",/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2005,ummmmmmm,," I loved this show!!!
","i remember watching this show almost every day after school, and i forgot all about it until i brought it up the other day with my friends. they ALL remembered watching it too, and we spent nearly an hour talking about the fun memories we had with Loonette, Molly Dolly, and especially the dust bunnies. the entire show is fun and educational. Loonette introduced me to time, and many other scholastic experiences that i have kept with me throughout my life, all the while making me laugh. you can guarantee that all kids will enjoy this, despite the many new shows they are coming out with now. I give many hearty thanks to this show, and i am very upset that they took it off of the air. Watch this show, and you will see why.",/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2007,lil_gobs10,9," Kids love this show, I know from experience!
","i remember watching The Big Comfy Couch when i was younger. it was my favorite show of all time, and my absolute favorite part of the show was the dust bunnies. i thought they were so funny and cute. i was tickled by the fact that i had a cabbage patch doll that looked similar to Molly, and one year i was Loonette for Halloween and carried around my doll. the show is very educational, it introduces me to clocks and time, and stretched my imagination. now, about 14 years later, i am almost 16 years old, and still remember my favorite kid show. my mom is a daycare provider and i have a 3 year old sister. one day my mom found a video tape of one of the episodes at a garage sale, and the minute i found out she bought it i popped it in and watched it. i still love the show!...and i got mad at my mom for not buying more of them ha ha. i recommend this show to parents, as a kid who loved it. I agree that they should start airing The Big Comfy Couch again!",/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2005,cutensweetlilblonde,," a great television show!
","This was such a great television show. Kids learn a lot from it and they know how to be polite and they also learn things from this show. It is very upsetting that it got canceled, but they still do play it. I just don't know what time and what channel. My sister has seen it on t.v. just two days ago though. When she told me, it brought back good memories of the right thing she taught me. I will always remember Molly, Loonette, the dust bunnies, Snicklefritz, Major Bedhead, and more. It teaches kids so much on responsibility and politeness. I hope that this television show will go on for such a long time so that when I have kids, they can watch it too! The Big Comphy Couch is a great show and always will be to me. I hope that they put it on television more and make more shows of it.",/review/rw1140052/?ref_=tt_urv
