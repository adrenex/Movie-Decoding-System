18 December 2019,MOscarbradley,8," Surprisingly sobering and well worth seeing.
","Rick Wershe Jr's claim to fame, or infamy if you prefer, was that at fourteen he was the youngest ever FBI informant before becoming a kingpin drug dealer at sixteen. Yann Demange's (he made ""'71""), film ""White Boy Rick"" is a 'Serpico'-like account of how Rick got into this and it makes for surprisingly sobering viewing. It didn't help that his dad, (an absolutely terrific Matthew McConaughey), was a low-life gun dealer and his sister, (Bel Powley, brilliant), a junkie. You might say that with a family like this, a life of crime was inevitable.",/review/rw5909228/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2018,masonfisk,7," STRANGE BUT TRUE...!
","A believe it, it's true tale of the youngest drug dealer to be caught & sentenced to life imprisonment for dealing over the maximum weight allowed by law even though he was a stoolie for the Feds. Cue the early hip hop tracks & we're thrown into the depressing world of Rick, a latch key kid growing up w/a loving yet irresponsible father (Matthew McConnaughey), a drug addicted sister & some well meaning grandparents. In trying to save his dad's life, he volunteers to go undercover for the FBI & police to keep track of the players involved in the drug game. In a case of being overwhelmingly over his head, Rick tries to play both sides of the law as best he can but he's not the brightest bulb around so his days of being a player are numbered. Nothing we haven't seen before (it kinda reminded me of Donnie Brasco w/its cop/crook dynamic) but it does move when it needs to & the cast of supporting players are vivid & of the moment. The lead played by Richie Merritt, who's never acted before, acquits himself nicely & if he decides this is his life's vocation, the acting world will be better for it",/review/rw5909228/?ref_=tt_urv

22 September 2018,aciessi,6," Not That Bad.
","White Boy Rick is the cinematic equivalent of Sloppy Joes. It tastes good, but it never coalesces into something satisfying, with a solid base of support to keep it together. White Boy Rick has all the ingredients of a great film. A stellar all-star cast, excellent cinematography, razor-sharp editing and a story that keeps you invested the entire time. But something seems missing. For one, some of the story seems rushed to get to the more interesting aspects, without properly explaining how we get there. For example, how did the FBI hone into Rick and his father for an FBI investigation? The agents just appear in the beginning, and we're supposed to roll with it. Now you understand why I compared it to Sloppy Joes. The exposition, at times, is pretty sloppy. But fortunately, never once did that take me out of the film. White Boy Rick is a thoroughly good time at the movies. The performances, notably from McConaughey, are top notch. White Boy Rick himself garners sympathy as a lost soul, and that's important to clarify. Some people might write this off as a run-of-the-mill crime thriller biting off ""The Wire"". If I was so inclined to be jaded, maybe I'd agree. But always give things the benefit of the doubt. Give it a watch?",/review/rw5909228/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2018,peeedeee-94281,5," Just okay
","I was expecting a movie that showed the rise (and fall) of the youngest gangster in America, but I ended up getting a movie with an identity crisis. It didn't know if it wanted to be a crime drama or a family drama. Too many details were skipped or fast forwarded, like Rick's rise to power in the second half of the movie. Then it all comes down crashing so fast, I felt like they ran out of time trying to tell the story.
The acting was average, I didn't see any particular standout performances, and it was hard to feel empathy for any character.
Overall, an okay movie, worth streaming maybe somewhere down the road.",/review/rw5909228/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2018,jdrubnitz,8," Glad I spent the money, despite mediocre reviews.
","Yes, if you expect this to be a Hollywood ""gangster movie"" with distinctly extreme highs and lows in the plot, you'll be extremely disappointed....but if you remember that White Boy Rick is just a human being, and this is a film about human beings struggling, you'll appreciate this film.",/review/rw5909228/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2018,macinasent,8," Good but not Great Movie
","I went to see this with an open mind as the reviews were mixed. I actually enjoyed the movie. Yes, some parts were slow but this is not Infinity Wars people (the Marvel generation wants an explosion or murder every 2 minutes). I actually found the dad's character as the most believable. His struggles in life and poor decision making was the actual catalyst for most of the stuff that went on. I say go see it for yourself. May not be a date movie but definitely a guy movie for sure.",/review/rw5909228/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2018,billgamble,7," Not your typical drug dealer movie.
",I enjoyed most of this film. There were a few slow parts and its just as much a family drama as it is a crime/action flick. I thought newcomer Richie Merritt did a good job. He is likable and I found my self rooting for him throughout the movie. The setting of the film is early to mid 80's Detroit when factories are closing and the city is starting to spiral downward. This is a bit depressing but the city itself is kind of a character in the movie because of this. You understand why young men turn to a life of crime when there are no other ways to make a living. White Boy Rick was more a victim of his surroundings and environment than anything else. I can't recommend that you sprain an ankle running out to see WBR but it is worth seeing.,/review/rw5909228/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2018,boatsfra,5," Entertaining but Missing Something
","Hello-
Watched WBR last night because I love Matthew M in anything he does. I did read the reviews and have to agree with the middle of the pack here: the movie is entertaining, but the plot goes from side to side which makes for an unpleasant watch. Did it leave a mark in the annals of movies that I have seen? Yes, but only because it's based on a true story. All the actors pour it on but the acting isn't enough to save this movie from being really great. WBR is a good movie and the ending is satisfying, but for two hours it's a mishmash of story lines. I do recommend watching MM in a supporting role here, but don't get too excited.",/review/rw5909228/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2018,scott3020676,8," Quite happily surprised
","Wasn't really looking forward to seeing this film at first. I was intrigued to find from the very beginning the exposition and plot brought my attention straight to the screen. From beginning to end I love the one liners and the party scene and the whole family aspect and growth. Hated the ending, but it was the ending I could expect watching white boy rick from beginning to end.",/review/rw5909228/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2018,larryct48,7," White boy Rick transported me back to the 80s
","I like White boy rick. The casting was done correctly. Rick was believable as a teenager gangster who gets caught up in the drug business. I believe the chemistry between the Father and the son. 
 
The story progress well adding a punch of drama one after the other until we get the conclusion of his life. ",/review/rw5909228/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2021,kosmasp,9," No good guys
","Can someone be to young to be a criminal? Or a snitch? Or both? And if so, what do you need to convince him to go either way? Or both ways of course. White Boy Rick is based on a real character and a real story. It begins with a bang of sorts - though I reckon weapons still are a big draw in America. For the rest of the world it seems mental that at gun shows almost anyone (actually ANYONE) can buy automatic weapons.",/review/rw5909228/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2018,Aktham_Tashtush,7," Wasn't perfect ,, but the due of Matthew McConaughey and Richie Merritt made it really good.
","The movie is apparently based on a true story,, the script was good ,, the acting was phenomenal ,, but to be honest in here ,, i don't think of the story itself as a really good one ,, like a a Matthew McConaughey good ,, but it turned out fine at the end i think ,, the movie was good ,, emotional ,, and thrilling at times ,, one of many stories in Detroit at the end of the last century.",/review/rw5909228/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2018,tkmcc-08780,9," Gritty, intense
","This is a real roller coaster of a movie - dizzying highs and sickening lows. In all the betrayal and redemption there's a dysfuntional but compelling family story that forms the core of the movie. It's a bit choppy, some things seemed a bit unfinished and the dialogue and accents (reportedly realistic) are sometimes hard to follow. But the performances are worth watching. I'm probably going to see it again.",/review/rw5909228/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2018,stephanie-jones21,7," Pleasantly Surprised..
","White Boy Rick: This is a true story based in the 80's about a 15-year-old, Rick Wershe Jr, who worked as an undercover FBI informant. 
I hadn't read up on this story, because I wanted to watch the movie not knowing any details. I was pleasantly surprised. This movie was not what I was expecting. I went in thinking it would be a Pablo Escobar kinda movie, but it was not. It's about a teenager trying to figure out how to survive living in a low income part of Detroit. It was heart wrenching, and even had some very funny parts. It also had some parts that made you shake your head and say, ""what is he thinking?"" In my opinion, it's definitely worth the watch. Also, I was completely blown away by Richie Merritt's performance. Especially since this was the first time he's acted, ever.",/review/rw5909228/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2019,cyifly-2,5," Very Underwhelming. Wanted To Like it. Tried To Like It. It Just Wouldn't Let Me.
","White Boy Rick started off pretty well. I knew nothing about it and didn't know the background of the 'true story.' After watching the movie, I'm not sure I do now either. The movie had good people in it, but it plodded along pretty slow. When the story seemed to pick up or get interesting, it just dropped right back off and went kind of limp.",/review/rw5909228/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2018,AudioFileZ,8," Poverty, Drugs, & Questionable Law Enforcers Collide For A Tragic True Film
","White Boy Rick is about poverty and crime. That certainly doesn't make it special in any way, but the story it tells is a true one I had never heard of which seemed interesting. This is one sad story and the movie pulls no punches, it's bleak from the first. The way it unfolds has a sense of dread as to what next. In this chaotic mess there's the bond between a single father and his son which gets so turned around it could only happen in a cesspool of a dark world without hope. This movie was real enough it was painful to watch. I'd have to say the story and the director pulled no Hollywood turns for embellishment. If you're curious watch this heart wrenching unravelling of lives. The saddest thing isn't even that it's a true story. Far worse it is is just one of thousands not unlike it. It is truly heartbreaking in its sincerity and realism. Those without options often get turned into criminals and used, with false beliefs shattered, lives destroyed. This movie nails that to a fine edge. See it and be disturbed. And, BTW, newcomer Richie Merritt gives an accomplished performance as Rick Wershe, Jr..",/review/rw5909228/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2018,dpb0402,10," Heartbreaking
",White Boy Rick differs in lots of ways from most gangster style films of today for one reason. It's mainly centered as the name would imply around white people. This is a movie about a white kid in Detroit who is going through a life just as hard as any black child in any other film like this about crime and gangsters. ,/review/rw5909228/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2020,muamba_eats_toast,7," Pretty good

9 October 2018,tigerfish50,1," Dumb Boy Rick
","The interminable morality tale of 'White Boy Rick' grinds on for almost two miserable hours describing how the teenage son of a fly-by-night gun dealer becomes a bad boy in Detroit's criminal underworld. In common with almost every 'based-on-true-story' movie, fuzziness around crucial plot elements creates the strong suspicion inconvenient facts have been omitted to create a more sympathetic narrative. The script doesn't provide much background to explain Rick's acceptance into a gang of black drug dealers, nor does it reveal much detail about his role as an informant for some dubious FBI detectives. Even after Rick starts his own dealing operation, the story consistently portrays him as an innocent adrift in an ocean of sharks.",/review/rw5909228/?ref_=tt_urv

12 September 2018,kjproulx,7," A Streamlined, Yet Effective Film
","Although there is just more content being made today than in any other decade in history, it does seem like films based on a true story have become even more prominent throughout the medium. Not knowing much about this particular story, known as White Boy Rick, I went into this film not truly knowing where it would end up, but still managed to feel a little unsatisfied with it as a whole. There are many biopics out there that handle material in a unique way, but everything about this film feels safe. While the story itself is quite fascinating and the character of Rickie enjoyable to watch, I can't help but reflect on the fact that this film strayed as far away from taking risks as it possibly could have. Here's why I believe White Boy Rick is an enjoyable film to watch, but won't really surpass anyone's expectations of it.",/review/rw5909228/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2021,ethanbresnett,8," Very intense and gripping story with great performances

19 September 2018,SuperSlim451,7," Ricklantis Mishap
",The movie isn't bad. It isn't mouth dropping awesome but it is highly intriguing. Its a movie that starts off a little slow but the speed starts to pick up and it stays steady. Its not the most ideal story but its one that when you watch it you start to question why things happen the way they do. Why pick from the lower level families but then that's typical. The trailer tells enough of the story that you get the gist of it. ,/review/rw5909228/?ref_=tt_urv
