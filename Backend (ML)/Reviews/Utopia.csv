18 July 2019,RJBrez,7," Probably not a 7 but need to balance the ridiculous scores out
","Okay I'm a 34 year old male who watched this movie the other day. I'm not ashamed to admit it. I like Greg Kinnear a lot and the Hemsworth kid.
I'm not a Miley fan by any means but it's clear all of these low scores bashing this movie are in response to hating her.
It's a simple love story with teen angst and all that. It doesn't rewrite the genre by any means but it's not terrible. Has so some beautiful music and cinematography as well. Give it a watch if you're bored and keep an open mind.",/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2010,Organic_6,1," Miley's most honest display of human emotion since deleting her Twitter account.
",Most writers would sell out by repeatedly writing screenplays that are vastly different from one another. Take Christopher Nolan for example; going from a psychological thriller where the storyline is paced backwards to an Oscar-winning blockbuster in which a world renowned superhero faces off his arch nemesis. Talk about a lack of consistency. A true writer gracefully keeps revisiting the same story over and over and OVER again and a great example for that kind of writer is Nicholas Sparks.,/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2011,gradyharp,," For Nicholas Sparks Fans
",Nicholas Sparks has found a formula about teenage angst an finding love despite non- supportive parents: from the number of books and films that use his formula it would seem he has hit pay dirt. THE LAST SONG is Sparks' 14th published novel on the same theme as the preceding 13 and was published in 2009. One year later he transformed that sudsy story (with some help from Jeff Van Wie) into another of his formula films and turned it over to TV director Julie Anne Robinson to map out the predictable story.,/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv

31 March 2010,blueeyedbeauty776,1," Waste of time and money
","I'll admit I was excited at first to see this movie. I had just finished the book a couple days ago and was psyched to see such an incredible book brought to the theater. The book was amazing: funny, romantic, sad, cheerful, pretty much everything you could want in a book. Well, everything that made the book great was taken out in this appallingly horrible movie. It felt torturous to watch what with Miley Cyrus absolutely slaughtering the character of Ronnie. After finishing the book, I realized I couldn't see her as the character, but I figured she couldn't be too horrible. Oh how wrong I was.",/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2011,tsmithjr,4," A really poor storyline and poor acting
","Miley Cyrus fans might hate me for saying this, but the makers of ""The Last Song"" should have hired a real actress for the lead role. Miley obviously doesn't have the talent or know how to act. I had nothing against her, but in this, the first role I've seen her act in, it seemed like she was just playing herself and not playing any part that was written for her.",/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2010,lilholik,4," One thumb down, One as confused as Miley Cyrus
","Alright, first I shall note that I have not read the book. I hadn't even seen a trailer for this film before I had gone. I went with my mother and sister who had both read the book and more than enjoyed it. I really had no idea what this story was even about. I walked in with a completely open mind.",/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2010,TVfan,1," Where do we start...
","It's been 5 years since I've reviewed a movie on IMDb, but oh... I am compelled! Where do we start? One of the producers has the last name of Cyrus, so I guess that explains a lot. But let's forget Miley's ""acting"" and address the story itself. I've always thought Sparks overuses death to illicit emotion in his readers/viewers (even though The Notebook and Message in a Bottle are two of my favorite films). But that aside, was there a single un-contrived moment in this film? They (whoever ""they"" is) tried to squeeze every type of plot device imaginable into this movie. So many cliché conflicts going on, I laughed more times than I can count. Hope I didn't disturb the other two people (both teen-aged girls) in the theater. However, hats off to Kinnear for an honest performance.",/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2010,blackbriar246,4," It was just so..... flat
","I didn't read the book, didn't want to. A bunch of my friends went to go see this movie, and I went with them. There are a few things wrong with this movie. First, Miley Cyrus cannot act. I mean, at all. It's painful to watch. Second, there is no originality. Just mix up a bit Twilight and most of Dear John, and you've got rather predictable The Last Song. Third, the characters. Ronnie is annoying enough without Cyrus, unbearable with her. She was such a brat at the beginning that I felt no pity the rest of the movie. Will makes several idiotic mistakes that cause Ronnie to have another temper tantrum. The little brother is cute, but irritating at times. Overall, this is just a flat, overrated chick flick that has the depth of a Disney Channel movie.",/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2010,ifuseekkody,10," Goodbye Hannah Montana - Hello Miley!
",The Last Song is a great movie. It is a coming of age movie but not just a chick flick. All family members will enjoy this movie. Miley Cyrus plays a somewhat troubled teen and blames her troubles on her parents divorce. Her attitude quickly takes a turn when she falls in love and even more of a turn when she finds out that her father is dying with lung cancer. Take a box of tissues to the theatre. Miley plays this dramatic role very well.,/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2019,ifyogwude,10," This movie is amazing
",This is a lovely movie. It's a clean love story for the whole family. Yes N. Sparks uses the same formula.....yes it's not entirely original but it's damn effective and it works here. I love it. It doesn't hurt that Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are the main characters either. I love it.,/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2010,Robert_duder,4," An unbiased opinion...the movie is still not good...sorry Disney
","I am an absolute sucker for Disney films...live action or otherwise. I have also enjoyed previous Nicholas Sparks films and I, unlike many, many other adults have no hatred or dislike towards Miley Cyrus. I think she has talent and is an idol to millions of young girls and has never done anything overtly outrageous to cause scandal so my dislike of this film has nothing to do with the stupidity of hating a film just because Cyrus is in it. In fact I thought the Hannah Montana movie was cute for what it is. The fact is this is one of the most boring Sparks films and stories and this is the first one he adapted himself. Maybe it worked in book form but I won't be rushing to read it because nearly two hours of a story that really could have been told in five minutes around a camp fire is enough for me. The characters were vapid and empty, the sad ending was forced and annoying and the good performances were buried under a long rather boring story, and a love story that happens so fast your head will spin. In fact The Last Song shows why love is so convoluted given the two fall in deep ""real"" love after ten minutes of being together. Its just really silly drivel and its not Cyrus' fault but she doesn't help either.",/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2015,Gordon-11,," Can't decide what it wants to be
","This film tells the story of a teenage girl and her brother, who are forced to spend the summer with their father in a southern seaside town. She meets a charming guy and falls for him, but unfortunately life gets in the way.",/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2010,tylerkaiser,10," Seriously people?!
","Grow up. The only reason why this movie has an average of 3.1 is because of Miley Cyrus. People wont give her a chance and they feel they can only bring her down is by sitting behind a computer screen. But guess what people - I'm sure she don't care! There is people who love this movie, like myself. People are going to watch it and people are going to buy it. So you giving it a 1 star rating is no harm. This movie needs at least a 6 or 7 star rating.",/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2010,katie-joy,6," 'Last Song' hits some good notes, misses others
","Enter Veronica 'Ronnie' Miller, a recently graduated seventeen-year-old with an attitude problem, divorced parents, a fresh shoplifting arrest and combat boots. When Ronnie is sent from New York to Georgia to live with her dad for the summer, she is less than thrilled and at first resists letting anyone in.",/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2015,anaconda-40658,3," One Song Too Many.
","The Last Song (2010): Dir: Julie Anne Robinson / Cast: Miley Cyrus, Liam Hemsworth, Greg Kinnear, Bobby Coleman, Kelly Preston: A long repeated concept regarding last chances to do right. Miley Cyrus and her younger brother are spirited off to their father's beach house for the summer where she is reluctant to reconnect. Director Julie Anne Robinson is backed with fine photography but the screenplay is a cliché ridden romantic farce. Cyrus will go through a predicted up and down relationship with some meathead surfer, will mend things with dad, and save sea turtles. None of this is very interesting and it only serves as an opportunity to cash in on Cyrus's young fan base. Liam Hemsworth has the thankless role of pearly whites boyfriend who goes through a xeroxed jerk around relationship that contains all the passion of a punch to the testicles. Greg Kinnear has the one decent role as a father is is blamed for the burning of a Church. He will die, of course, but he at least has the one bit of dignity in the entire film. Bobby Coleman plays younger brother who does his best but the role is more or less a temporary companion for the Kinnear character while Cyrus is turtle sitting and nearly getting laid. Kelly Preston plays the mother who spends most of the film off screen likely trying to contact her agent and find out why her career has come down to this. The Cyrus fan base will love this film until either the fame dies down or they realize what candy coated manipulative bullshit this truly is. Hopefully the last time we'll see or hear of a Last Song screenplay but that is probably wishful thinking. Score: 3 ½ / 10",/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2011,Walter_Skinner,4," A obviously bad film.
",This is a obvious bad movie. I'm pretty sure everyone that went into the theaters went in and knew this was going to be crap. Everyone at least had doubts about it because Miley Cyrus is given the lead role. If you thought that Miley Cyrus was going to do a good job and show some acting chops then you were probably living in denial. To be fair this movie would had been mediocre even without Miley Cyrus in the lead (although she didn't help things) the reason why is that the book from Nicholas Spark's was crap so the odds were good that the movie was going to blow too. The movie even seemed like it was going to bad after the opening credits. Almost like the movie wanted to be seen as much as the reluctant boyfriends that were dragged to see it.,/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2010,jaybob,3," Cliché ridden badly directed from Disney( Touchstone)
","This is another BAD film from Touchstone. Apparently the magic that was Disney is no more. The screenplay for this mess was written by Nicholas Sparks, He wrote the novel after he did the screenplay,Hopefully he omitted all the clichés that are in the movie.",/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv

22 May 2010,jhunt709,8," At least 'The Last Song' was a good one.
","'The Last Song' (based on the eponymous novel by 'The Notebook' scribe Nicholas Sparks) appears to have received much criticism for various aspects of its running time, many of which I can respect, however it strikes me as vicious that viewers are focusing on Miley Cyrus' likability as if it were the overall staple. For a single, external aspect to polarise the audience in such a manner is extremely unforgiving to the bigger picture, and therefore I'll address the Miley factor in a neutral manner. In a leading role separating her from alter ego Hannah Montana, Miley proves she is a blossoming young actress who just needs a few more opportunities like 'The Last Song' in order to find her feet out of a Disney character's shoes. In my opinion her main fault is to play Ronnie, a troubled and troublesome teenager, with a hanging lower lip and fixed gaze for much of the first act, failing to explore why her character is broken. This issue is short-lived however, and Miley plays a happier Ronnie later in the film to a stronger degree, benefiting from her arcing character which should have been developed sooner. In my opinion, the script is at fault for striving to depict Ronnie's demeanour through conventional methods such as bratty behaviour and cocky dialogue. Some may take issue with the watered- down characters (particularly readers of the book) but this is a difficult problem for any screenplay when adapting from the written format.",/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2014,contrerassherry,4," Wake up, Miley
","I like romances and tear-jerkers but this one didn't do it for me. Along with Miley Cyrus' mediocre acting, there were little things here and there that distracted me from getting into the movie.",/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2011,TheLittleSongbird,3," Forced and predictable, but better than it could've been
","I saw this movie for two reasons. One is that it is based on a book by Nicholas Sparks. The other is the wonderful Greg Kinnear. I will be frank, the book is much more engrossing emotionally and the characters and story are far more believable. The Last Song isn't completely unwatchable. Greg Kinnear is brilliant and definitely the best asset of the film, the film does look good with pleasant scenery and cinematography and the soundtrack is tolerable.",/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2010,ajfdomingo,4," Nice Looking Foliage
","After seeing this movie, I don't think it is too harsh to say that I really do hope it lives up to its title. The Last Song is a nearly two hour cliché. An upside is the acting of Greg Kinnear who is quite moving as the ailing Steve Miller. There are moments when the drama within the Miller family is touching but you snap out of it easily as if anticipating Miley Cyrus breaking out into song. I am not even sure whether the casting is right. Miley may have her fair share of fans as a singer but as an actor, she can seem rather stiff. It's a good thing though that Georgia is scenic because there are times in the film that I did end up watching the scenery.",/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2010,DICK STEEL,2," A Nutshell Review: The Last Song
","Once in a while, I'm game for a good dose of sappy romance, and what more than one by Nicholas Sparks, who have had a number of his books, from Message in a Bottle to Dear John all being translated from page to screen. But I guess too much of anything rarely work wonders, even if you throw big name stars in the film to shore up and try and mask all the clichés, and frankly off the heels of Dear John, The Last Song just feels like the neglected twin clamouring hard for attention.",/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2010,monkey_kelstar,3," Miley Cyrus or Nicholas Sparks...
","I don't know who to complain about more. I saw this movie just for fun, not expecting anything wonderful. But I didn't realize it would be absolutely horrendous. And it wasn't just one element of the movie that was horrible; it wasn't just the acting, directing, or writing. It was a combination of all those factors. The screenplay was clichéd from the start. Ronnie, more of a brat than a troubled teen, reluctantly arrives at her dad's house along with her overenthusiastic little brother. Their divorced parents talk, ""We hurt them, you know."" Ronnie walks down to the beach with a pout on her face, ""My dad made me come down here for the summer - not like I wanna be here."" She runs into a hot local guy, who for some strange reason takes an interest in her, despite her attitude. It's already something any 15- year-old who wanted to write a book or a screenplay could think of on their own. ",/review/rw2233010/?ref_=tt_urv
