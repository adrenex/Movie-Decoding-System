21 July 2021,planktonrules,8," A tough film to explain or even discuss, as there are so many alternative explanations for what you've just seen.
","""Donnie Darko"" is a mind-bending film that is VERY hard to rate or even review. It's incredibly strange and watchable...but also confusing and open to MANY interpretations. My advice is just watch it and see what you think.",/review/rw1025429/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2016,Leofwine_draca,9," One-of-a-kind head-scratcher
","DONNIE DARKO is a film hard to classify. Some might pass it off as a routine teen flick but they'd be mistaken. It has all the trappings of adolescent movies, from soul-searching teenage talk to parent problems and plenty of intrigue and simmering violence at the local high school, but it goes a lot further than that.",/review/rw1025429/?ref_=tt_urv

","I love everything about this film! It's been among my favorites for many years. The theories that could be well in depth for hours, the soundtrack, sweet camera shots, and the brilliant writing! I'm proud of the fact that this is my 300th review on here. I'd say this is my 4th favorite film ever after Fight Club, The Matrix, and True Romance. The floating wormholes is super cool to me and the soundtrack is so damn good!",/review/rw1025429/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2006,barnabyrudge,10," Incredible film - an enigmatic treat that throws up more possibilities each time you watch it.
","""Donnie Darko"" is the very quintessence of cinema. Enigmatic, absorbing, humorous and thought-provoking - it is a film that throws up endless possibilities and debates, and ingeniously allows a whole range of interpretations that viewers might wish to pursue. There are many viewers who prefer films that provide immediate closure. In the minds of such viewers, films like ""Donnie Darko"" are unsatisfying or irritating or, worst of all, pointless. Then there are viewers who like to be challenged, perhaps even teased, by films. I would urge everyone - regardless of their usual preference - to give ""Donnie Darko"" a go. Even those who are usually dead against subjective and open-ended films of this kind will almost certainly find themselves questioning and pondering over what they have experienced. And those who revel in the mysterious, the enigmatic and the downright peculiar will absolutely LOVE this film.",/review/rw1025429/?ref_=tt_urv

16 December 2013,gogoschka-1,10," Perhaps the most relevant social commentary on U.S society ever put on screen.
","Above all, this film has a kind of flow to it like nothing I've ever experienced in any other film before. The magic sets in from the very first moment, when we see Donnie waking up (and the song 'The Demon Moon' starts), and you just go with that flow and let yourself be drawn into that world. The story unfolds like a dream and the ambiguity (at least in the theatrical cut) as well as the fantastic songs help create an absolutely unique and strangely compelling atmosphere.",/review/rw1025429/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Harvey"" meets ""The Mothman Prophecies,"" as a troubled teen starts hallucinating a horrific 6-foot-tall bunny rabbit that brings him dark forebodings about death and disaster in the very near future.  A streak of ""Heathers"" is mixed in as well, with trenchant satirical observations of high-school life in the late '80s (story set in Oct. 1988), involving a priggish teacher, a self-help guru (Patrick Swayze!), and a put-upon fat girl at the fringes of the herd.  Finally, a whiff of ""Back to the Future,"" in the form of a local eccentric who just may have discovered the secret of time travel, but a secret that has more to do with spirituality than technology.",/review/rw1025429/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2020,jtvukovich,9," Donnie Darko Shouldn't Work, But Does
","Alternate universes are a concept not often used in film because the concept itself is seen as nothing but a risky addition to a story. Despite this fact, the film Donnie Darko seeks to utilize the concept of alternate universes to tell a heartfelt and genuine story. Donnie Darko is able to successfully make a simple story turn mind boggling without making it devoid of entertainment and substance.
Set in the year 1988, Donnie Darko is a story of a teenage boy named Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) who suffers a lot of psychological problems. One night after arguing with his parents, Donnie is lured outside of his house by an ""imaginary"" humanoid bunny named Frank (James Duval) and is told that the world will end in 28 days. After being lured to a golf course and falling asleep, Donnie awakes the next morning and returns home only to find that a jet engine has fallen onto his house, specifically Donnie's bedroom. Donnie then takes this psychosis-induced threat seriously and spends the next 28 days trying to figure out how to prevent the end of the world.
Written and directed by Richard Kelly, Donnie Darko is a film that showcases immense amounts of character development and unique plot devices. Plot devices as unique as a time traveling demented bunny help make this film most effectively send its message of how one's issues can help break through the conventions of society. Considering Donnie Darko is Richard Kelly's debut film as a director, it is very impressive that he is able to create such a well rounded story with such well written characters. For instance, characters such as Donnie turn from a psychologically challenged troublemaker to a quote unquote ""superhero"" as referenced in the film. The film itself does a very good job of making Donnie a relatable character. Actor Jake Gyllenhaal has quite an amazing performance as he goes on to make viewers truly believe Donnie's struggles. Being Gyllenhaal's first starring role, Donnie Darko took a risk and rolled dice with its chances of being an enjoyable motion picture. Similar films such as Unbreakable take risks by being a serious story accompanied with a superhero narrative. Although the film proves itself to be successful, there are some characters that could have been better written. For example, characters like Donnie's love interest Gretchen (Jena Malone) don't do a great job connecting with the audience and seem rather dull. Gretchen, like Donnie, is also a troubled teen, but she fails to make her struggles adequately believable to the audience.
Overlooking certain character elements of the film, Donnie Darko proves to satisfy its audience by having very beautiful and strategic cinematography. The film's opening scene showcases Donnie waking up on a dirty mountainside road with an enigmatic swirling storm of clouds and debris on the horizon. Another scene shows the jet engine gracefully yet violently collapsing on Donnie's house. Richard Kelly overall did an amazing job of crafting each and every scene.
Though many may view such a cult classic as ""pretentious"", Donnie Darko succeeds in strongly sending an underlying message of how nonconformity in a society is not a weird but rather important thing. It tasks viewers to think differently about the so-called ""weirdos"" in society. Weirdos are special...weirdos have the power to save the world. The film suggests that Donnie lives in a tangent universe, which can be created when the fourth dimension is corrupted. A tangent universe is similar to a primary universe in every way except it is greatly unstable and can collapse in on itself in only a few weeks after being created. The idea of saving the world is brought upon Donnie by his hallucinations: Frank tells Donnie that the world will end and then guides him to help stop it. Donnie soon comes to find that he must stop the tangent universe he is living in from collapsing in on itself and swallowing the primary universe. The story does such an outstanding job of coming full circle and it really makes you sit back and think about the philosophy behind it all.
Is Donnie Darko a film that's too difficult to grasp? I would say that it is not considering all the underlying philosophical jargon that is spread between the lines of the movie. Donnie Darko is a risk taker. It proves that incorporating difficult concepts to make a great story is not impossible. It ultimately sets up its own challenge and successfully tackles these challenges beautifully.",/review/rw1025429/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2004,Jim-512,10," You can't watch it only once
","I first saw this on cable tv. Thumbing through the channels I stopped just as Donnie Darko was beginning. I thought the title was weird, and readied my thumb on the remote channel selector...pointed it at the TV...and it stayed there for the rest of the movie! I couldn't stop watching! I've never seen a movie like this. The movie has a beautiful aspect (especially the end). And there are a few chuckles as well. Contrary to the more critical commentary, there is depth and complexity to the story that kind of requires you to see it more than once. I'm no genius, but what I gathered the basis of Donnie Darko to be is about our part in the deliberate DESIGN of our destiny, and I catch more each time I watch it. ",/review/rw1025429/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2021,roujin_d,7," I didn't understand the story but I still enjoyed it.

22 February 2011,Hitchcoc,9," Worth a Second Look
","This is a film that crept up on me. It takes one time to sense the rhythms of this film and to accept the strange apparitions that dominate it. As the closing song, ""Mad World,"" typifies, the central character can only accept his demons and, in doing so, have a scintilla of joy. This is about a different kind of altruism, unstuck in time, that some of us wish we could have. Donnie is a popular guy with all kinds of possibilities. He is loving, smart, and eccentric. His family has him seeing a psychiatrist because his actions due to misunderstood visions have caused him to act violently at times. They love him and want him so badly to sort things out. He finds a soul mate, but she has her own demons and never fully understands what is going on. I can't say much because a first time viewer needs to be kept completely in the dark. I would like to watch this again to see things unfold with foreknowledge. It's one of the most intriguing movies I've ever seen.",/review/rw1025429/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'd heard that this film was ""different"" so when I saw the DVD on offer a while back I thought I'd give it a chance.

15 December 2020,christopher-underwood,7," the soundtrack is beautifully curated
","I think my main problem here is that the film is not completely serious enough for me to fully engage nor frivolous for me to just sit back and enjoy. I found it pleasant enough and remembered little from watching it on theatrical release but there had to be a reason it has taken so long to look at it again and it must be that it is ultimately unsatisfying. There is an abundance of ardent extras on my disc but I just didn't feel up to giving this any more time. On the positive side Jake Gyllenhaal does well in the lead and is convincing in a very difficult role, the film looks great all the time and the soundtrack is beautifully curated with some beautiful songs sounding batter than I remembered them.",/review/rw1025429/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2019,charbelelaro,10," Donnie Darko is wonderfully strange
","Donnie Darko directed by Richard Kelly is a drama/fantasy/teen flick/thriller/science fiction film... and some how, its actually works. It follows Jake Gyllenhaal's character, Donnie Darko, who is tormented by hallucinations of a man dressed in a bunny suit. These visions manipulate Donnie to commit a series of crimes, as repayment for being saved from a life threatening accident. The peculiar nature of this film, truly sets it apart within the world of cinema, making it one of the most memorable movie experiences I've ever had. This film is so incredibly entertaining, mainly due to the perfect line delivery and performance by Jake Gyllenhaal. The entire cast has a level of peculiarity which just makes them so compelling to watch. I particularly love the unconventional cinematography which further emphasises the bizarre tone of the film, as well as the integration of an iconic soundtrack which sets the context and tone of the fictional world. Donnie Darko is wonderfully strange. But beneath all its weirdness, its actually really emotional. Every character is completely human and at times can be very relatable. The film has an underlying tone of sadness throughout, making it such a complex story with a lot of depth. Yes you might not get all the answers by the end of the film, but I love the fact that I can invent my own theories and explanations which allows the movie to make sense to me. Donnie Darko had me fixated on the screen for the entire runtime, and had me pondering about it for a week, so therefore I give it a 10.",/review/rw1025429/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've heard so much about this "" Wonderful , mind blowing masterpiece "" . Interestingly enough most of the rave reviews of DONNIE DARKO came via this very website which goes against the grain of other reviewers . Roger Ebert only gave the movie two and a half stars while many other websites dedicated to film reviews claim this movie is confused and overrated . It should also be mentioned that if it's such a great , thought provoking piece of cinema then why did it miss out on so many nominations at the more prestigious film award ceremonies ? And don't say politics , an independent feature like IN THE BEDROOM didn't pick up any Oscars but that didn't stop it being nominated for several",/review/rw1025429/?ref_=tt_urv

","The fact that this is the Directors first film is amazing to me. The scenes dripped with style, yet that style never seemed distracting. None of it was self congratulatory or gluttonous.

He starts to see a mysterious man in a rabbit costume, who tells him that the world is going to end in 28 days.

If there is world destruction ahead based on what this film tries to tell it's viewers, it's the fact that mind control has taken over and manipulative behavioral methods are the wave of the future, and that the world is doomed because the rabbit has once again come out of his hole and turned humans into pod people willing to believe the bunk that comes out of this film.",/review/rw1025429/?ref_=tt_urv
