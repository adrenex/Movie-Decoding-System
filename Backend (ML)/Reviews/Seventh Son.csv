",Tales of the Jedi slaps. It brings the prequels energy to the table and presents a lot of context for two fascinating characters in the history of Star Wars : Dooku and Ahsoka.,/review/rw8651613/?ref_=tt_urv

26 October 2022,mataidixiong,10," Where On Earth Did This Come From?
","No joke, I had zero expectations from this and I have come away from it with my jaw on the ground, my eyes wide and tears. This was top shelf Star Wars. I am NOT going to give spoilers, just want to say that if you are a Star Wars fan, drop everything and go and watch this right now.",/review/rw8651613/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,poseyfan,10," Brings me back to Cartoon Network days as a kid
","I grew up with Star Wars the Clone Wars, the original 6 movies, the original Clone Wars series, SW music, action figures, legos, etc. So... This show brought a lot back to me.",/review/rw8651613/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,jordyreyers_8,9," The only criminal thing to do..
","Dave Filoni strikes again. Short stories in a real Star Wars manner. Maybe simple storylines, but follows the same strong story principle of the StarWars Clone wars. For people who haven't Seen Star Wars clone wars series this is a nice start to begin with.",/review/rw8651613/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,olliemarch-72638,9," Clone Wars but deeper and darker
","WOW. I really was going into this not expecting much, I'm sure most of us saw the short episode run times and were disappointed at first. But it really really works all together as complete, hour and 15 minute feature.",/review/rw8651613/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,googreus,10," Amazing
","No filler just killer!!! You got a really great storyline for a show with 6 short episodes. The action is just great, amazing animation and writing. Dave Filoni really outdone himself with this mini-show. Despite the short screentime the story that is presented throughout the 6 episodes adds a lot to the star wars franchise. This show completes the backround of Ahsoka and Dooku's backstory really well. Although i would have loved to see longer episodes the content we got is just great. I had high expectations for this show and i was still blown away by how good the 2 story arcs were. I had a great time watching this and i highly recommend it.",/review/rw8651613/?ref_=tt_urv

27 October 2022,andmikkelsen,9," INCREDIBLE Star wars experience!
","Wow this show really surprised me! I was semi excited for its realease, but ended up exceeding my expectations!",/review/rw8651613/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,metalisabot,10," Enriching!
",This show single handedly fills gaps in the Star Wars prequel era that have been missing for over a decade. Each short displays a unique encompassing idea that ties together and brings fruition to the sequel trilogy. Each short contains a good upbeat pace and an overarching theme diving deep into the important life events of essential characters of the prequel era. With amazing cinematography and beautiful score this animated show stands out as one of Dave Filoni's masterpieces. Dave Filoni has truly done it again with an amazing enriching animated series that rivals with animated series such as the Clone Wars.,/review/rw8651613/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,Engerek01,10," Clone Wars Upgraded
","I wouldn't dare to claim this show is necessarily better than the Clone Wars, the show which I believe is the heart and soul of the Star Wars Universe. I am merely suggesting that this show is for the same audience, filling in the blanks and enhancing the story, sometimes dramatically.",/review/rw8651613/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2022,TheJonipoon,5," Too short, too on the nose
","I wasn't overly excited about Tales of the Jedi, mostly because Ahsoka has been milked enough and as an audience we already know her motives, personality and struggle throughout the Clone Wars and Rebels era. But I was curious about the prospect of seeing a young count Dooku explored in a TV show. Unfortunately, there is not much to see here. The potential of the series is held back by a lackluster script and having too few episodes.",/review/rw8651613/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,Dannyboi94,6," Good, but too short
","As a big fan of the animated shows that Filoni has made, I was looking forward to this series. While it is good, there are some amazing scenes in this... it's way way too short. As soon as the episode gets going, it suddenly ends. Each episode should have been double in length, especially 3 5 and 6. They also hyped up that Nesson was returning as Jinn, but he literally only spoke about 3 lines. What?",/review/rw8651613/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2022,alindsayal,8," A Great Star Wars Show
","I feel like Star Wars animation has been pretty consistent over the last few years but Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi kind of snuck under the radar and I managed to watch the season yesterday and here is my review for the first season. The premise of the show documents two stories, it shows how Count Dooku became estranged from the Jedi Order and how Ahsoka Tano rose up and survived the events of Order 66.",/review/rw8651613/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2022,saadanathan,8," The tales of the jedi are astonishing 8/10
","As a huge Star Wars fan from a young age, I've always been passionate with star wars projects on the horizon, unfortunately these last few years were a bit mediocre to say the least. Many canceled projects and shows that were met with less satisfaction.",/review/rw8651613/?ref_=tt_urv

26 October 2022,nickstefanut,10," Best Star Wars of 2022
","Fantastic. Episode 1 start slow and had me questionning the strenght of the series and show, but after Episode 1 it was all banger after banger after banger. Dooku's story is great and provides much needed context of Dooku's reasons for turning to the dark side which was previously only available to those who'd read the legends comics. Ahsoka's story in the final 2 episodes is beautiful. I really loved Anakin training Ahsoka to basically survive Order 66.",/review/rw8651613/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2022,mrsambo-63680,10," More of THIS! (And less of... that)
","Powerfull writing, strong bound to the Star Wars we all deserve...
I read somewhere that this series was not looking good, but reading also WHO was involved in this make me watch it with no hesitation!",/review/rw8651613/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2022,Seb_3,8," Short and sweet
","The team behind one of the best animated series to date is back. 6 small episodes of Star Wars exploring the backgrounds of Ashoka and Count Doku. Amazing voice acting and the same animation style that was used for the animated series, meaning it looks absolutely outstanding, while the pacing of each episode is on point.",/review/rw8651613/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2022,MisterJxroen,9," May The Force Be With You

27 October 2022,craigs902,9," Dave feloni does it again!
","This is awesome and gives you a great story from the past. Done in the same manor as Star Wars The Clone Wars. If this is the way Star Wars is now heading under Dave Feloni, I feel it's in great hands and I therefore can't wait for another full length movie.",/review/rw8651613/?ref_=tt_urv

26 October 2022,mcmdfwf,10," One of the best star wars project
","Star wars tales of the jedi is seriously one pf the best written, acted, animated and every other aspect of cinematography you could possibly think of. And i didnt even start talking about how emotional it hit me. If you are a star wars fan and you dont even have to see the Clone Wars (which i highly recommend to) to enjoy this with maximum likability. Its not like MCU project where you have to see 30 other movies just to understand a story of one of them. Conclusion: A perfect Star Wars anthology original story with extremely good Star Wars athmosphere, great animation, voice and cinematography.",/review/rw8651613/?ref_=tt_urv
