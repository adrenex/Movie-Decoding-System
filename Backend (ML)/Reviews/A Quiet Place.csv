23 March 2005,The_Void,8," Anything but dull
","Swimming Pool is a first rate film from French genius François Ozon. This thriller makes best use of everything that makes cinema great, and it is therefore a delight to view. Swimming Pool follows Sarah Morton, a British author that travels to her publisher's dream home in France in order to have a rest while she works on her new book. However, her tranquillity is soon disturbed when her publisher's daughter; a sex-crazed, good time girl, turns up out of the blue and turns Morton's rest into something quite different. One criticism that could be, and has been, made of this film is that not a lot a lot happens. That, however, depends on your viewpoint; the action is stretched, but the relaxed tone of the film blends magnificently with the beautiful French scenery, and Ozon's attention to detail with the characters ensures that, although slow, Swimming Pool never descends into boredom and there's always something on offer for it's audience to enjoy. I, personally, was completely entranced from start to finish.",/review/rw3800049/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2004,TxMike,," Clever movie that does not reveal itself until at least 15 or 20 minutes after it is over.
","Our neighbor Donna has a knack for buying offbeat DVDs, and 'Swimming Pool' is one of the more. She asked us to see it, and explain it to her. Charlotte Rampling plays the central character of Sarah Morton, a writer who seeks new inspiration at her publisher's vacation home in the south of France. All is well and quiet until Julie (pretty and nubile Ludivine Sagnier) shows up, claiming to be the daughter that Sarah's publisher failed to mention. Sarah and Julie are like fire and ice, oil and water, acid and caustic. Everything that Julie is, carefree, bold, and over sexed, Sarah isn't. Then, what we see developing is Sarah using Julie as the inspiration for her writing. Sarah begins to encourage Julie. And Julie provides much inspiration! This isn't a movie for those put off by nudity or the French habits of liberal sleeping around. But for those who like a clever and absorbing story, that will tingle your brain cells when it is over, having you asking ""What exactly happened?"" , then you will probably enjoy this one.",/review/rw3800049/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2005,evanston_dad,7," A Mostly Effective Erotic Thriller
","Makers of erotic thrillers need to be careful, as that is a genre that, if not handled carefully, can quickly fall prey to silliness and excess (think ""Fatal Attraction""). ""Swimming Pool"" is a thriller in the style of ""The Deep End,"" and more than once I was struck by similarities between the two in their respective tones and reliance on water as a recurring visual motif. Also, both films have a middle-aged female as the protagonist who becomes involved in covering up for the actions of a child (in ""The Deep End"" a literal child, in ""Swimming Pool"" a figurative one). Also, both films are completely unpredictable. Neither goes the direction in which the viewer thinks it's going to. However, ""Swimming Pool"" is much more abstract, and its ending leaves you wanting to watch the whole thing over immediately with an entirely different perspective on the action. This gimmick always makes for a memorable ending in movies that employ it, but too often it makes the rest of the movie seem somewhat pale in comparison, and this is the case here. ""Swimming Pool"" plays tricks with your perceptions, but the finale to which the film builds seems somewhat anti-climactic when it finally comes. ",/review/rw3800049/?ref_=tt_urv

29 May 2004,big-16,," Spoiler: Sarah is a woman, not a machine
","I saw the movie today. I think Sarah feels that everybody sees her as an object, not as a woman with sexual longings and desires. (You know, the same way we think of our parents or grandparents.) I don't think she ever had an affair with John. John simply seems as the only Male (sexual) Connection she has in her life. She gets jealous of the new writer, because he is flavour of the week with the publisher John. She craves for some attention, not as a money making machine, but as a WOMAN. She leaves for France, and tries to leave the mother-side of her womanhood behind (even if just for a little while) She finds it hard (because she still phones her father to see if he is all right, but only once in the beginning.) She doesn't want to be seen as a mother, but as a woman. She feels weird getting in touch with her sexual side. Our true selves always come out if there is no one watching over your shoulder, but there always is. That is why she removes the cross from the wall, because she feels uncomfortable going on this journey with God watching over her shoulder. ",/review/rw3800049/?ref_=tt_urv

11 June 2004,claudio_carvalho,7," An Excellent Idea Wasted In a Very Disappointing Conclusion
","In London, the successful and weird middle-age writer of police and mystery novels Sarah Morton (Charlotte Rampling) is passing through a phase of lack of inspiration. Her publisher John Bosload (Charles Dance) invites her to spend some summertime days in his house in a small town in France, where there is inclusive a swimming pool. He also suggests her to make the experience of writing about a different theme. Sarah accepts the invitation and travels to the wonderful and lonely place. A few days later, she starts writing again, but her quiet rest is shaken with the unexpected arrival of Julie (Ludivine Sagnier), the sexy daughter of John. From that moment on, reality and dream blends in Sarah's world. I did not dislike this movie, but I believe it is indeed an excellent idea, wasted in a very disappointing conclusion. There are many unexplained subplots and the story is completely open to the most different interpretations, and of course I have mine. But without reading any information or clue from the writer and director François Ozon about his real intention, it is impossible to give a precise clarification. Europeans usually like this type of story, but in this situation, the film does not give necessary hints about the real intention of the plot, and the viewer can speculate only. Charlotte Rampling has a magnificent interpretation, Ludivine Sagnier has a very erotic performance, but to become an excellent film, many clarifications are missing. My vote is seven.",/review/rw3800049/?ref_=tt_urv

","An elegant puzzle of a movie, from the creative mind of Francois Ozon whom ever since his breakthrough hit SOUS LE SABLE is enjoying a major career high. SWIMMING POOL brings the viewer into the world of Sarah Morton, a writer of detective stories and close in essence to Anne Perry, Ruth Rendell, and Patricia Oornwell. She's tired of writing the same story over and over again... her favorite character is stale, and only the elderly really read her books anymore. There's no life... but a trip into the French countryside that her publisher John Bosload (Charles Dance) has her take brings forth unexpected twists when John's daughter Julie (Ludivine Sagnier) enters the picture. The two could be no more different if a wall were erected in front of them, and not just due to age: Julie is carefree, hedonistic, and a nudist who has sex with any man she can find and isn't up to apologize for her behavior. Sarah is the total opposite: restrained, spinsterish, an introspective woman who is only concerned in getting her novel done.",/review/rw3800049/?ref_=tt_urv

","Swimming Pool contained good symbolism, acting, and especially great cinematography.  The movie was really too slow for me for the first 70 mintues, however, and I kept wondering, what is the point of painting us a pictures of this dour and unhappy author's interactions with a lustful irresponsible bratty young woman?

","Don't know why some of my literate friends who are reputed movie aficionados thoroughly trash this most entertaining movie. Maybe in this day of cartoon character/techno-effects/fast-paced action flicks, this type of leisurely paced, yet focused tale, is passé. I for one, however, very much enjoyed Messr. Ozon's subtle, twisting and metaphorical story-telling. I shall not even attempt to rehash what scores of erudite reviewers have already delineated regarding the unfolding of the plot line. E.G., were there two daughters, one legit and the other out-of-wedlock?

26 September 2005,chinwag,9," Fun with the process of creation ...
","... Ozon lets us see his characters directly; and then through the mind of Charlotte Rampling's (as author) character. Two strands apply - the direct-to-Ozon's mind, and the indirect, via Rampling. And there the fun begins. We glimpse a gawky, immature, teeth-in-bands teenager (blonde) towards the end of the movie - Morton (the publisher's) daughter. But who has this blonde (Ludivine Sagnier) - who has she been? And how did she get to be in the house/novel/movie at all? Well now, let me see ... we learn at the beginning that Morton's daughter might well drop-in on the writer - as she is only borrowing Morton's house in the Luberon area of Provence. We 'accept' an idea of the incumbent blonde in all probability as that spoken of daughter. But she seems like a 15-year-old going on 35!!! She has an amazing amount of baggage for such a seemingly young girl. And she gets into such torrid, bizarre, and ghastly gargantuan fixes - all seem too improbable. The mix-and-match mode - as strand crosses strand, weaving a rich texture of reality versus illusion, fiction versus fact, and dream versus daylight - the enjoyment being in the management (in each viewer's mind) of the strands, understanding when the author's fiction is being played-out across the screen; and when we are back again inside the movie-director's mind (as opposed to one of his character's i.e the novelist). The local people encountered in the Luberon quickly become assimilated into Rampling's novel - their more outmodish acts being inventions of the novelist's mind (but being re-played inside an Ozon movie). And characters we might think are kith and kin of the 'real' people we encounter, are in fact nothing but kin to the fine imaginings of the typing hand. Ludivine Sagnier being the case in point - and she a cruel joke against Morton's dismissive inattentions towards our writerly heroine. The gawky, tooth-banded teenager has, in all likelihood, been in Provence all along - and in the projection of the novelist's mind - fashioned into a femme-fatale that makes the LuDIVINE we see on our screens, (and as the central protagonist of the Rampling novel, were it at hand to be read)!",/review/rw3800049/?ref_=tt_urv

","Okay, I hate to give so much away but after watching the film, there's no other way to review in a way that it would make sense to the people reading the review other than to tell it like it is. Nothing is real except for Charlotte Rampling's character and her publisher. The daughter character is also real but you don't see the real person until the end of the film. When Charlotte goes on the vacation to the French countryside to clear her head, she actually enters into the world of the characters she is about to write about in her new book. The daughter, the gardener, the guy at the café are all characters in her book and she is living vicariously through them and their lives. That said, this was a very bold film. The soft porn elements were very strong but the acting on the part of Charlotte Rampling was stronger. She is a great actress of her generation and should be celebrated for such a powerful performance. I applaud her for her nude scenes and her honest portrayal of a character we see too less of in Hollywood, the sexy older woman who is not threatened by us young-ins! The film is about imagination and how the author uses it to solve her real life issues. My favourite line from the film is when Charlotte says: ""Hmph! awards are like hemorrhoids, sooner or later, every arse gets them"" LMAO! Classic!",/review/rw3800049/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2006,dbdumonteil,7," Charlotte Rampling and Ludivine Sagnier stripped bare...
","In the guide of films by Jean Tulard, one of the very valuable bibles for any French cine buff, Claude Bouniq-Mercier had qualified ""Swimming Pool"" as ""an accomplished work which intrigues and fascinates"". He should have been attributed these flattering words to François Ozon's previous work, ""8 Femmes"" (2002), arguably his very seminal piece of work and one of the top five movies of 2002. In this film, the filmmaker transcended the whodunit by incorporating to a plot à la Agatha Christie other cinematographic genres like drama, comedy and especially musicals. Ozon also had had fun by peppered his film with movie-loving details and there was a strong Chabrolesque aura to unearth dark secrets of this bourgeois milieu. And, so the expectations were high for Ozon's next movie. Ozon had the guts to produce another work one year after ""8 Femmes"": ""Swimming Pool"". Did Ozon depicted himself in the character of Sarah Morton? Was he afraid not being able to renew himself and to be marooned to write another movie? Did he write and direct his 2003 film to eschew at all costs a block which could have been fatal? Anything goes but he seems to have overcome his fears and cropped a film up with several possible understandings and which isn't here to make the viewer lazy in spite of its little holiday feel because of the landscapes. At first sight, ""Swimming Pool"" is a film difficult to define and label. It could be a cross between a psychological drama, thriller with a dash of fantastic.",/review/rw3800049/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wicked, but ultimately silly little tease that floats along for a bit and finally sinks into a cinematic ocean of cliches and dry ideas. British novelist Charlotte Rampling goes to her publicist's (Charles Dance) summer home in southern France to be alone and to get some work done. Her hope is to get up from a mild writing slump and deliver another winner from the murder/mystery genre. Things turn upside down fast for Rampling when Dance's twenty-something daughter (the ultra-erotic Ludivine Sagnier) shows up unannounced. Naturally she has lots of friends (all male) and she likes to get her exercise at night. Rampling becomes nervous and agitated as she starts to drink, smoke and eat sweets uncontrollably to curb Sagnier's wild antics. They do not like each other, but both simultaneously become interested in cafe waiter Jean-Marie Lamour. The early friction between the two very different women soon turns a bit as Rampling learns about Sagnier's sad past (obviously never wondering if her tales are truth or fiction) and what happens when the youngster starts becoming an inspiration to the novelist's musings? ""Swimming Pool"" starts off so slowly and tries to come to life when Sagnier comes into the picture, but ultimately her beauty is not enough to offset a whole slew of problems found within. The fact that she is not much of an actress becomes apparent, even to most who will be entranced as she walks around topless and in string bikinis near the titled location. Rampling is moody and hard to figure out from the start (if you even care to figure out her dull character). The script by writer/director Francois Ozon (a very enigmatic young director from France) looks to put its audience to sleep and then wake them with would-be erotic situations and witty dialogue. ""Swimming Pool"" is really a pretentious and contrived work through and through. The film has more twists and turns than a water slide at a theme park and the payoff is more of a head-scratcher than anything else. Alfred Hitchcock antics get lost here on wet concepts and shortcomings several pages long. A wonderful score and super cinematography get wasted on this little flick. There is some smoke to be found, but very little fire. 2.5 out 5 stars.",/review/rw3800049/?ref_=tt_urv
