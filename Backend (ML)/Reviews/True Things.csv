5 August 2016,Red_Identity,," Chilling and effective. A slow-motion nightmare.
","This is the kind of slow-burn horror film that really, truly gets under your skin. the type of horror film that America doesn't make (although the last two years that has been changing, with flicks like The Babadook, It Follows, and The Witch). This won't be for every horror fan, especially those that want more craziness or loud jump scares. Instead, what the film does is establish its characters very well and from then on it lurks and creeps you out until you become more and more terrified by what's happening on screen. It's exactly the type of film that really lingers on the mind and I really hope more people seek it out.",/review/rw3659778/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2016,cjs6547,7," The new and improved Rosemary's Baby
","A subtle horror film not without its moments of suspense and utter creepiness. We follow Elena (accountant turned housekeeper, for some reason) who gets close to her employers (a couple who live in an isolated house without modern amenities, for some reason). She wants to save money quickly to go back to her son and so agrees to be surrogate mother for their baby.",/review/rw3659778/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2016,gavin6942,5," Better Than Average... For What That's Worth
","Louise (Ellen Dorrit Petersen) and Kasper (Peter Christoffersen) want to become parents but Louise is unable to have children. She seals a pact with her Romanian maid, Elena (Cosmina Stratan), to bear Louise's child, but things don't turn out as they planned.",/review/rw3659778/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2016,Leofwine_draca,2," Slow burning Danish horror
","SHELLEY is a Danish 'evil baby' film so obtuse as to be a really frustrating viewing experience. It's a low budget and exceptionally long winded story, in which very little actually happens in the way of action or incident throughout the lengthy story. Instead this is a film all about mood and creepy notes on the soundtrack; it's all hints and shadows and very little of anything actually concrete.",/review/rw3659778/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2016,maryann_blair,7," Eerie, dark, and effective
","Granted this film is a slow burn but the cinematography, dark atmosphere, acting, and score was top notch. Should watch when you are more relaxed and patient cause when you get there you will found it was worth the wait. I am a huge horror fan and I am sick and tired of the basic 90 min horror films that throw all the things at you in the first frame but with this director you have to have patience to fully understand the movie. There was 3 scenes I had to rewind that I missed the first time of viewing this movie. I agree with the thought of Rosemary's Baby by the way of David Lynch and I think it deserves a view. This is a solid horror film.",/review/rw3659778/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2016,manuelasaez,3," DIsturbing, but incredibly slow paced.
","Like watching a Tarantula molt, this film is incredibly fascinating, disturbing and effective. But, man, is it slow! Everything happens at a snails pace, and regardless of how thought provoking the events are, it does not excuse the pace of this supposed ""horror"" film. I am all for a slow-burn, in fact, I prefer them to teenage jump scares and other sophomoric tactics. But this movie literally made me want to watch it at 2X the speed, just so that people would pick up the f-ing pace. You know how there are movies that would have been effective if the creative teams knew how to just get to the good parts and edit themselves accordingly? This is one of those films. Had they been more overt with the horror elements, and made things flow just a bit faster, this would have been a worthy addition to the ""baby horror"" sub-genre. As it stands, it plods along, thinking it is being suspenseful, but in reality, it's just not getting there fast enough. Not recommended, as I am unsure that even the most ardent ""slow-burn"" fan will appreciate the pace of this film. That being said, the acting is superb, and the cinematography is top-notch.",/review/rw3659778/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2017,kosmasp,5," Child-less
","So it's a Horror movie and someone gets another person to carry their child for them. There could never go anything wrong now could there? Apart from the obvious and what we would expect (suspense, questions and themes of terror or at least Horror), this has some awkward acting in it. And while it may enhance the viewing experience for some, it may also feel wrong for a lot of others.",/review/rw3659778/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2016,RussHog,7," Well made - not for everyone
",Look - I cannot imagine what it takes for a group of dedicated professionals to film a horror movie like Shelley. The countless time spent to get the shots right. The lights. Makeup. Actors. For all of the effort taken to make a movie look gorgeous and haunting - one might consider a script that takes less risks to alienate the audience with artistic decisions and instead uses a story with more clarity and a stronger reversal of expectation.,/review/rw3659778/?ref_=tt_urv

3 October 2016,payamcommunication,7," good suspense
",The plot of the movie is simple but it develops fairly astonishingly. The dark atmosphere starts to appear from the beginning of the movie and turns into a not releasing stress in the middle. The suspend builds up all the way close to the ending which is the strength of this movie.,/review/rw3659778/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2016,barry-steers,3," Slow and Tedious
","Talk about slow paced! This movie just went on and on and on with no real progression. It was an hour and a half movie that could have easily been squeezed into 30 minutes with the needless scenes and repetitiveness taken out. The premise was good but due to a lack of a good script, editing and direction the film just meandered on with no real climax, pay off or closure. As it abruptly ended you thought ""Is that it?"". You could have forgiven the director if there was a great finale after the incredibly slow build up but it just whimpered out after 90 minutes of hoping that something great was going to happen. Greatly disappointing. You could see the director has seen the Omen from the numerous plagiarized snippets he randomly inserted (all the cheap ones that don't involve CGI)but it was just a very,very poor imitation to a movie that did this infinitely better. This was no horror and barely a thriller.Unfortunately the director thought broody scenes of landscapes made up for actual content.Sorry but this movie was a complete dud.",/review/rw3659778/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2016,etsenberg,1," Don't lose your time. This crap doesn't even have a plot.
","I trusted to the good reviews above, and it was a big mistake. This movie is not just slow-paced and boring - it just ends with no explanation of what was happening. The only thing you can guess - ""probably there is some evil in this baby"", but you guessed it from the very beginning and didn't need 1.5 hour for that. What kind of evil? Why? What's going to happen next? Did the husband die and appear in the house as a ghost, or did he just return home? No answers. The whole ""plot"" can be told in several phrases. A rather old woman never could carry a baby, so she and her husband ask their Rumanian worker Elena to be a surrogate mother. Elena agrees, but as her pregnancy progresses, she gets health problems and feels disgust to the baby, eventually trying to kill the girl in her womb. The doctors save the baby; Elena disappears from the plot. Then the husband begins to feel the similar disgust (for no reason) and tries to move the baby away from the house, but his wife prevents it (maybe killing him or maybe not) and returns home with the baby. Her husband is shown behind her. The end. There is NOTHING else in the whole movie, literally NOTHING.",/review/rw3659778/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2016,caiokaka,8," A film with climax.
","When I started watching this film had the idea that it would be more horror/Terror turned to psychological than to surprise, shock , it was like that , which in my view he managed to stand out in the genre , as well as The witch.",/review/rw3659778/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2021,surfisfun,5," slow in a bad way, check the fabulous ""Border"" instead.
","Like some say, slow in a bad way.
""Border"" was the same director film that made me want to watch this one.
Border was slow but in a great way.
maybe some will luv it.

3 May 2020,borgolarici,6," The obsession of motherhood
","Almost everyone compares this movie to Rosemary's baby but I don't think it's right.
Imho this movie isn't about demonic children but it's a metaphor for the obsession of motherhood (could be applied to fatherhood too tbh).",/review/rw3659778/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2017,Otkon,4," It's pretty much a silent-era Rosemary's Baby
","But while you cared about Mia Farrow, you will be hoping the demon spawn of this clunker is born prematurely and eats the Valium-popping cast. It's that foreign, art house and joyless. ",/review/rw3659778/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2019,beckyb219,7," Compelling but confusing
","A Danish couple living in the middle of nowhere can't have children, so their maid Elena agrees to be their surrogate. Once pregnant, Elena starts deteriorating physically and mentally, and becomes convinced that the baby is evil. This is a tough one to grade because it really is well-filmed and acted, but the story is all build-up and no resolution. I like ambiguous endings, but there are TOO many questions left unasked and unanswered. Is it a straightforward ""evil baby"" horror flick? Is it some kind of science vs. nature allegory? I don't know. I did enjoy it, mostly thanks to the two female leads, but I'm still confused.",/review/rw3659778/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2021,orionhi,1," Slow and pointless
",If a movie has to leave this many unanswered questions I'm inclined to think they didn't know what their own movie was about. It's very slow and boring and the end is nonsense. If I need to fill in this many blanks to explain what happened then I don't even need the movie. I'll imagine the entire thing. That way it will make sense.,/review/rw3659778/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2017,girlshopsalone,8," Slow-paced, but well-made
","Although this movie fell under ""Thriller"" on Netflix, it is more of a horror movie. I don't care for horror because they are not made-well and always seem to be the juvenile, gratuitous-skin, slasher-kind . This movie, on the other hand, I really liked. It is the kind of movie that actually scared me. It is slow, but it builds-up and is well-acted. Could have done without the vaginal scene, but loved the build-up on the scare factor. People are posting that there is no plot and they didn't understand it. Leo put a spell on Elena, who in turn transferred to the baby and in turn transferred to the father-That's it. Just enjoy the movie!",/review/rw3659778/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2016,Panos242,7," A very interesting horror film which mostly leans on building an atmosphere of dread.
","A very interesting horror film which mostly leans on building an atmosphere of dread. It makes it successfully thanks to Ali Abassi's neat direction, the exciting photography (very good work with the lighting) and the well organized editing (pay attention to the rotation of the scenes which are taking place inside the house and the shots of the environment outside of it). The story of Shelley isn't very original but is told through a very elliptical narration. This will begrudge many viewers with limited patience since most of the answers the movie puts are not answered clearly. A daring way to narrate which i appreciated. 7/10",/review/rw3659778/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2016,amichnea,1," Don't waste your time

11 March 2017,brautigan-126-784250,6," ending explained
","I'll keep it short and sweet, boneheads: the baby didn't live. The scene in the hospital was a delusion. The ""eye change"" sequence we see with the shaman is the key clue: it's the exact moment he realizes he's looking at a dead baby. Emma's dead body is hanging from a rope as a sort of punishment. There was nothing supernatural in the entire movie. Emma went nuts, that's all. Now enjoy the movie again, you're welcome.",/review/rw3659778/?ref_=tt_urv
