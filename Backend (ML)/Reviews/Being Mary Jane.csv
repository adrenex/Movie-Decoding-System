16 April 2022,Calicodreamin,6," Visually stunning, lacked depth
","No surprise that the visuals were breathtaking, some beautiful shots and immersive cinematography. However, there was no depth to the plot. Some lovely character moments.",/review/rw8045247/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2022,andrewchristianjr,7," NOTHING FELT EARNED.
","Though the style part was enjoyable on it's own; the cinematography, special effects, costumes, score, set design and much of the acting was brilliant. It felt great to lose myself into the feel of the wizarding world again. But the plot and the writing felt unanchored in anything real or relatable. Nothing felt earned. Events just happened without much anticipation or appreciation of their significance, and I didn't feel invested much in any of the plot lines or characters. I'm not expert enough to pinpoint exactly what went wrong, but I know something did.",/review/rw8045247/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2022,benjaminskylerhill,2," It puts the ""dumb"" in Dumbledore
","It's sometimes funny and often creative, and it's an improvement over its predecessor by default, simply because rather than only 5% of the plot being consequential, about 30% of the plot is consequential.",/review/rw8045247/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2022,siderite,5," Disappointing to the extreme
","The Harry Potter books achieved so much success because a dedicated writer thought about the story for years and the result, imperfect as it was, became beloved by millions of people as the effort showed. This film is perfect, though, a total and complete mess, written by people who can never come up with more than an elevator pitch and the crave for a big payout. The movie uses a plot that purposefully makes no sense, built on a previous film that no one remembers and manages to cement Dumbledore as a manipulative asshole whose value for humanity is that he looks nice compared to the genocidal maniacs he fights against. But he's gay, so that's fine.",/review/rw8045247/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2022,guskeller,6," Convoluted
","The Secrets of Dumbledore is convoluted by inconsequential plotlines and redundant characters. It's so unfocused, it doesn't have a consistent tone or protagonist. The film centers around wizarding politics, but doesn't elaborate on them. This shrinks the Potterverse and satisfies nobody. Meanwhile, Redmayne and Law's protagonist duet is equally unsatisfying. Oddly, no character feels essential (besides Grindelwald) and action sequences don't progress the story. Ultimately, the movie is overstuffed and develops nothing. Mikkelsen and Fogler excel in their limited roles, but they're sparse in this jumble. Without streamlining, The Secrets of Dumbledore is emotionally uninspired.",/review/rw8045247/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2022,Hayden-86055,2," Really, really awful
","Where do I start, Fantastic Beasts the Secrets of Dumblebore is absolutely terrible. The plot is barebones at best, makes little sense in many places (random portkey, German minister makes speech ""every gets a say"" then let's an animal pick the leader of a country, random exposition scenes just for the sake of it etc) and the acting is average. The music was ok but honestly I enjoyed barely any of this even the action was dull, had no stakes and wasn't exciting.",/review/rw8045247/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2022,sbweightman,4," Lacks the magic and awe the series deserves,
","Rather slow and boring with a politically oriented plot which throttles itself through its design choices. There's lots of spectacular looking CGI and special effects, but most of the action was in dark scenes which made it hard to see what was going on and for all the magic in the film, it had none of the awe or amazement of the Harry Potter films. Some funny moments and the acting and music was ok, but the secrets were underwhelming and although the production value was high, the entertainment level was not.",/review/rw8045247/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2022,jakethesnake-42007,4," The franchise needs to stop
","Fantastic beasts was always a good idea on paper but it turned out meh and now it's officially dead in the water. It would be interesting to see if they make another after the poor box office results and mixed reactions. I found the first movie ok not great not good but ok , the second was meh and now it's also meh but it's the worst of the series. Like the first 2 the length time is a main falter. The story is not much its most of a waste of a movie. I hope the series stops I love Harry Potter but it's just a cash grab now.",/review/rw8045247/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2022,thePopcornExplorer,6," A sad legacy to the Wizarding World
","I am from the Harry Potter generation, I grew up with the books and the movies so there's no denying that I am a massive fan of the saga, so when the first news of prequels came out I was as you might imagine expectant!",/review/rw8045247/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2022,eddie_baggins,6," Still lacking a certain magic, the newest Fantastic Beasts is a step back in the right direction
","In pleasing a result, the third entry into the Fantastic Beasts franchise (a franchise that seemingly exists with support but no dedicated fanbase or huge fanfare) is a marked improvement on the dire misstep that was 2018's The Crimes of Grindelwald, even if Harry Potter veteran director David Yates still can't find the real magic to enliven this wizarding world property to a level that would have it competing in the same space as the beloved films that came before this J. K Rowling property.",/review/rw8045247/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2022,wheatley-20230,1," Fell Asleep
","I probably managed to stay awake for less than half of this film, if you add up the bits that I endured. Perhaps that means I don't have the right to judge it. But to my mind it accurately reflects the fare on offer. A lot of the dialogue was inaudible. Nothing much happened for long periods. When action does kick in it can be visually stirring, but with so little investment in the characters and their predicament it was not exciting.",/review/rw8045247/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2022,opticuscro,3," Not good, ðŸ‘Ž
","I watched this at the cinema, I can't say I'm sorry for the money I gave for tickets, but it almost is. First of all I came to watch a fantastic beast movie, the first two parts were great for me so I thought there would be this one too. Well I was wrong, here the emphasis is on interpersonal relationships, politics, the emphasis is on promoting same-sex sexual orientations (in backgrond) and many other smaller and bigger things that have absolutely nothing to do with either genre or story, very few special effects unlike previous works and very few fantastic beast. Well mostly suppress your enthusiasm and don't expect much this movie is an below average timekiller .. blah.",/review/rw8045247/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2022,mason25,3," Jumbled mess that needed a light turned on and audio turned up
","Admittedly I forget the previous fantastic beast movies, but this seemed like a jumbled mess of disconnected scenes that didn't mesh to form much of a plot. No one cares that dumbledore is gay, it has literally zero bearing on anything. It adds nothing to the plot beyond the contrived amulet he has from between them.",/review/rw8045247/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2022,Nagitokomeda,2," Secrets of Dumb-bore
","Where to begin with this agonising experience? Its a 2 hour 20 minute film that feels like its twice that length. I think the writers must have been paid per character they introduce, because this film has so many characters they sink the ship that this franchise is.",/review/rw8045247/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2022,paul_haakonsen,4," The magic fizzled and was replaced by a political drama...
","Having recent sat through the two previous movies, I was looking forward to getting to see the third movie in the franchise titled ""Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore"". I must admit that I was having some expectations to writer Steve Kloves and author J. K. Rowling.",/review/rw8045247/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2022,xTkAx,4," It feels like the series got ruined with this one
","Here's a short little 154 character review: it was long, boring and uninspiring, lacking what the previous two films had. It's time to sunset the series.",/review/rw8045247/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2022,AdamCinelioglu,1," Send this franchise to Azkaban
",Just when I thought it couldn't get any more insulting than The Crimes of Grindelwald - Yates & Rowling outdid themselves in spectacular fashion.,/review/rw8045247/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2022,Tetrahejon,6," Its not about Fantastic Beasts Anymore
","The Fantastic Beast Movies should have been about Newt Scamander and friends going on wild and crazy adventures where they run into or face numerous mythical beasts. Imagine Newt interacting with an infant Fluffy (from HP Sorcerers Stone) or taming a Hungarian Horntail. Unfortunately, the fantastic beasts are overshadowed by the Dumbledore VS Grindelwald conflict. However, the film contained stunning visuals and great character performances; but lacked the tension and pizzaz required for a final battle. Worth a watch but falls short with the fantastic beasts being cast aside for a plot that does not entirely deliver.",/review/rw8045247/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2022,pouya-sanaei,1," A very nice cash grab
","Well what do you expect here, 0 story, nothing makes actual sense. Just pure cash grab tend to waste your time and gove you nothing back. Every second of this movie is a plot hole.",/review/rw8045247/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2022,Ruben17,6," The lack of intensity in the action scenes made this movie rather forgettable than rewatchable

23 April 2022,aalokpattnaik,1," Its a dumb movie
","No story, too slow. Harry potter series was famous for its storyline, they could able to cover a big book in 2hr movie. Now in this fantastic beast series in last 3 movies combined they havent shown 1/10th what a single harry potter movie used to be. Its like 2 page of script and they are making movie.",/review/rw8045247/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2022,yocar-97431,3," How disenchanting
","It is nothing short of magical... as to how they pulled this rubbish off. Pretty bad only augmented by the fact that this series is over. (Wand salute!) No more having to watch Nut or Newt. And I guess Johnny Depp couldn't make it again. So, just believe it really isn't Mads, it's magic. And, you're not very magical if you don't see it. Maybe the spell will lift now, but don't see how really is.",/review/rw8045247/?ref_=tt_urv

",A movie with some solid ideas for character development and a promising overall plotline that constantly loses itself in meaningless subplots and ridicoulus moments of mere fan service.
