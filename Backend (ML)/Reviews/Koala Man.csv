26 February 2018,rsvp321,," Dustin the baby ruining this show!
","This show could be an 8, 9 easily, just on its own merit, but the whiney, petulant, pouting, baby Dustin is a terrible distraction.",/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2018,smittie-07333,," Disgusting- Seconding Dustin, you suck!!
","I have watched this show twice now and am thoroughly disgusted at Dustin's behaviour. The way he speaks to people and treats people is not acceptable. Especially his father. I realize that this show, like all the other reality shows, are scripted and if this is the type of behaviour that sells a show then it is wrong. If Dustin needs to be portrayed this way then he needs some help. Who would want to be portrayed as an egotistical abusive person for money. Dustin, if you think that makes you a hero, I've got news for you. I had so hoped the son of your father's girlfriend would have smashed you in the mouth, but to his credit he didn't. You sooo deserved it! ",/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2018,cageydog,3," It's not interesting
","It's boring. Every other gold mining related show is better than this. Take away ""Gold Rush"" as it's lead in and viewership will be limited to family and friends of crew and cast members. I gave it a chance, watched the first 6 episodes, but it just isn't interesting.",/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2018,intrepidami,3," Even more about drama,break downs, failure than finding gold.
","Typical Gold Rush fare, but on a minute scale! Let me put it this way, these guys make the Kellys look like Einsteins. After what could be months(you can't really tell) they only have 2 oz of gold? There's a 73 year old that nearly dies EVERYTIME he dives.There's his prick son, who despite ALLEGEDLY owing Todd Hoffman $50,000, likes to basically say ""F him"" while holding a pistol. There's an ex Military ""expert"" diver whose third choice to dive? ",/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2018,mrcustoms,," Does anyone else thing the $50k loan from Todd Hoffman was not real?
","This series was pretty entertaining (although Dustin has become a jerk) but does anyone else think the $50K loan was just a scripted plot device that Discovery used as an excuse for Todd to make guest appearances, add drama, and boost ratings? One reason I say this is because I don't get the worker that Todd sent to ""observe"" (forgot his name)... are we supposed to assume that Todd was paying him to work for Fred? That doesn't make any sense. Second, they only seem to talk about the $50k loan during occasional (what feel like) scripted segments. It felt like the director would show up and say ""today we are going to shoot the scenes where you are worried about the loan"". Since both Todd and Tony showed up it the series, it's not hard for me to believe that Discovery had a script for Parker to show up too but it either got cut out or Parker refused to do it.",/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2018,richlpz-69753,3," Dustin, you suck!!!
","I have never written a review to any tv show in my life but after watching the latest episode of white water, I had to set up an account and leave a review of what I think was a horrible behavior (I'm been polite here) by Dustin. 
What happened to you from Porcupine times to turn you into this hater, egocentric maniac that speaks to people or better yet, to employees, the way that you do? I know better, no one does it better or how I wanted, no patience for anyone! I felt bad for you in the past while now you are coming accross as petulant know it all overgrown child. 
Shame on you for doing this to someone after it was done to you and knowing what it feels like. Between you and me... treat me like that and you might have ended up in the fire pit. Douche. 
Besides that, love the show. Fred it's coming along great.
Keep it up.",/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2020,phlexss,2," Beyond stupid!
","Season 3, Freds team: so they think the best chances for gold are directly below the bigger waterfall upstream. What do they decide? They go downstream and work slowly upstream towards the waterfall. So in stead of immediately going after the best chance for gold they decide to waste lots of precious time on the places which are less likely to have gold.
Does this sound logical to anyone?
This show is beyond stupid now.",/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2018,dja22,3," Dustin the jerk
",He wants to portray himself as a tough wannabe and a jerk? Not real entertainment value. Sorry.,/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2021,Sayitasitis212,3," Watch the last 5 minutes of each episode
","I like to see the gold that comes out, it's a testament to the advances we make as time goes on. What I can't stand is the monotonous drama week in week out. Even the actors, I mean minors don't look comfortable on the screen at times.",/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2020,brenttiefenbach,1," Terribl√©
",This show is terrible. Gets worse every episode. 2 worst characters from gold rush. Neither can gold mine. And their band of merry fools... No one's making any money gold mining. They just rely on discovery cheques.,/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,chcbleachers,3," Same story, every season
",Here is how the season goes:,/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2021,xmu367,1," Gold Rush White Water is terrible
",They act all excited when they drag out an ounce or two of gold. They constantly talk about millions of dollars of nuggets under big boulders. I don't remember ever seeing them weigh a eeeks worth of sluicing. I think the gold they get is planted by the producers,/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2019,Robertsmith76,4," Can't watch it after season 2
","No gold, I'm done. If I wanted to watch drama, I watch real house wife's of Beverly Hills. Dustin needs to chill. Poor Fred. His tough sob. But his hearts not right imo.",/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2022,howboutthisone_huh,6," I don't get it
","I love the locations and props and all that but just how far will they go to test what viewers will accept. The show basically makes no sense whatsoever. I hope they are getting paid by the tv production because the gold they come up with on the show wouldn't feed my turtle after expenses. So why are they so excited at the end of the season over 30 ounces; most times less than that. Basic primary math and common sense says that 4 people over 4 months is nothing even if all their costs are picked up by the tv production. Another, ... on gold rush, fred hurt the so-called expert, digs thru how many seasons to get to the bottom of this glory hole and all he does is dig a hole so deep and narrow that it's too dangerous to mine and we're expected to believe that they gave up and filled in the pit. Then season 4 of this series he does exactly the same thing except for the 'filling in' part. He digs a whole so deep and narrow that they have to give up. And if you notice most are wearing hats and so on with 'porcupine creek' embroidered. I googled it. You can find it on trip advisor. It's (was) a tourist attraction in haines, ak. But, what do people write about? Soap opera nonsense, not the incredible story lines.",/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2021,kandnwed,1," I'd rather watch Tony Beets floss his teeth
","This show sucks so bad. I LOVE all the Gold Rush shows so much and can't stand this White Water spin off. This spin off is one of the worst shows of all times. These guys have no safety standards, and the whole point of the show is to get Gold....in 4 seasons have they even broke 100 ounces? What a joke. Dustin is a man child, not a leader and the rest of the cast is an odd group of misfits. This show seems like a what not to do video made for OSHA. I would pay for a discovery+ subscription if it would give me a vote to cancel this terrible show.",/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2018,amoore-83969,1," As bad as it gets
",This show is no better than when they were in the north. I can see why Tod Would invest with them. All they do is find ways to disagree. I like the gold rush series but they could do better than to bring these people back. Thier ratings are going to fall,/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2019,kaphillips3,10," I love this show!!
","I have read how people don't like Dustin's behavior, BUT if you pay attention, he gives apologies when he is wrong, or kudos when jobs well done. Unlike Todd, Dustin gets in there and works hard along side his crew. And he works longer than most of the other crew members. He put everything on the line for this claim and his main thoughts are making him AND his crew rich, and SAFE!!
I love the show because it isn't always whining and yelling. They get along for most part, and seem to like what they are doing. I love the humor with these guys. All reality shows are not totally real, but they seem to genuinely like each other and work hard as a team. When I first started watching original Gold Rush I was drawn to the Dakota Boys and absolutely love their own show! PLEASE don't keep saying ""take it off air"". If you don't like it...fine, turn the channel. But don't ruin it for those of us that really like the show!",/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv

",I think you gold rush white water crews are awesome!!,/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2018,scania2230,10," Great Show.
",I love every minute of it. Watched each episode back to back and one of the other reviews say they think the $50K is scripted but in one of the last episodes when Fred calls up Todd. Todd says the gold percentage can wait but he needs the $50K back. That's probably because he paid that diver $50K to be there.,/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2019,bj-23878,2," Boring
",The show was kind of fun to watch it 1st. Now it's getting boring watching a couple of guys poor rocks out of a dam river just to get nothing. Boring boring boring I'm done watching the show.,/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2020,djdirect-45728,9," Good show , don't know why it has bad reviews
",I've watched the normal gold rush and I think this is better !,/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2018,TressaP,10," Best Gold Rush Yet
","There is excitement, suspense but most importantly, likable characters. The shows in the Gold Rush family are staple entertainment for my husband. I'll maybe catch a few minutes of a show here and there. The main reason I'm not a bigger fan is the characters themselves. As soon as I feel the need to yell at or smack someone for their attitude or stupidity I leave the room. Not so with White Water. I actually binged the whole first season with him and did not want to unleash any of my violent tendencies! Can't wait for season two!",/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2022,Jax200,3," Lot about nothing
","Really a lot of talk and no results. Like 'The curse of Oak Island', you wonder why these people keep going, until it becomes clear it's because the producers are happy!",/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2019,Runnerbikerlifter12,1," Please end
","This is the worst show out of all the gold rush series. I can't stand Dustin or Carlos. Both are arrogant camera hogs. Wes and Paul are two hillbillies who try to jimmy rig everything and have zero personality. Fred, Rich, and Casey that left were the only ones tolerable. Fred is a trooper for doing all that at his age but his son really needs to get punched in the mouth.",/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2022,icatq,10," Superb!
","God, I love this show. There's nothing better than vicariously busting a gut and freezing one's nuts off in the hope of striking it rich....all from the comfort of one's armchair! This goes for Gold Rush too, which I also enjoy, but this is by far the better of the two shows.",/review/rw7840699/?ref_=tt_urv
