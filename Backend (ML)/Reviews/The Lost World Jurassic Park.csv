","""Crash"" is a complex movie with a simple premise: set in Los Angeles it follows 8 main characters (and many, many more supporting) from all walks of life and races whose lives intersect at some point during one 24 hour period. These people are all different yet all alienated, to the point of breaking, so much so that when they come together, things explode.",/review/rw1231046/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Crash"" is a superbly made film. The actors are first rate, the camera style is engaging, and production value is tops. And despite all this, I would never recommend it to anyone. Why? I'll explain in my 4th paragraph but first let's talk about the story.",/review/rw1231046/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2005,Vitarai,9," Roller-coaster of emotions
","Like Altman's classic Short Cuts, and Anderson's Magnolia, Crash, by writer/director Paul Haggis weaves a tale of multiple characters through the web of streets we have come to know as Los Angeles. Unlike those other two films this one has a very specific theme to explore. From the opening line uttered by Don Cheadle we know this is to be a film about how people relate, and from the interchange that follows between Jennifer Esposito and Alexis Rhee (pretty sure she plays the Korean female driver who rear-ended her) how people relate tends to be ruled by first impressions or prejudice.",/review/rw1231046/?ref_=tt_urv

17 September 2020,Xstal,5," Colluded & Contrived Collisions...
","It's a shame that in order to present the diversity of racism and prejudice, the writer and director had to conjure up such a contrived set of chained circumstances, scenarios and aggregations. For the most part the presentation flows seamlessly through the lives of LA residents as incidents follow incidents over the course of twenty four hours or so, but it soon dawns on you that it's as manufactured as the cheapest plastic plaything and done so just to elicit what can only be described as a faux reaction to the events - as a result the impact is diluted and devalued.",/review/rw1231046/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2005,WriterDave,9," Bold and Compelling Treatise on Racism in Modern Society
","Take the pop-cultured infused socio-political discourse of a Spike Lee movie, the glossy grit of a Michael Mann LA crime story, and the compelling mosaic story-telling technique of a Paul Thomas Anderson film, and you'll get the ""feel"" for Paul Haggis' stunning directorial debut. To boil a film like ""Crash"" down to such terms, however, would do it severe injustice. Powerful and thought provoking, this is the most accomplished and compelling film since ""21 Grams"" premiered back at the end of 2003.",/review/rw1231046/?ref_=tt_urv

11 September 2004,Brambo,10," Review: Ensemble cast delivers top-notch performances in reflective drama
","In a drama strikingly reminiscent in style and tone of P.T. Anderson's film Magnolia (1999), the narrative in Crash shifts between 5 or 6 different groups of seemingly unconnected characters, whose relationships to each other are only revealed in the end.",/review/rw1231046/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2005,asbufra@yahoo.com,10," There is Good and Bad in All of Us
","There is good and bad in all of us. This movie explores this like no other. It will make you think about the nature of bigotry and stereotypes. The characters switch from heavy to hero in a way that is deeply moving and exhilarating. It is TV drama style writing where several different groups of characters and plots interweave (Paul Haggis) but with none of the limits of TV, it reminded me of ""Hill Street Blues"" which from me is a big compliment. I am a Don Cheadle fan and he captures the role. Sandra Bullock plays against character and pulls it off with ease. The most impressive performance to me was Ryan Phillippe's. Almost every nationality in LA was represented and they all were interesting and realistic. The ensemble cast and various plots blend together and keep your interest. Cast is great, music is haunting, writing is superb. Go see this movie.",/review/rw1231046/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a good movie if you are the type of person who needs everything spelled out for you, be taught moral lessons and have political statements preached to you. Obnoxiously slapping the audience in the face with its self-righteousness in every scene, Crash manages to be become the only film to which I have 'awarded' the lowest score to on IMDb: 2/10. I can't even believe how terrible this film is. I don't even know what the 2 is for because no redeeming aspects come to mind as I write this.",/review/rw1231046/?ref_=tt_urv

","I get the impression that I was watching a different movie to the majority of other people I know who have seen this film. It's not really that I found the film offensive or anything - just that the script was unbelievably amateurish for a film that had obviously had a bit of money thrown at it. I really respected Paul Haggis' work on the Million Dollar Baby script and was bitterly disappointed to see how bad this script was. It was clear to me that it was desperate to be the 'racism' version of Traffic, but I don't think Traffic was really a film worth ripping off in the first place. ",/review/rw1231046/?ref_=tt_urv

","The film's tagline is ""You think you know who you are. You have no idea.""

5 May 2005,the-movie-guy,10," This movies shows that we are not born with prejudices, we learn them
","People are born with good hearts, but they grow up and learn prejudices. ""Crash"" is a movie that brings out bigotry and racial stereotypes. The movie is set in Los Angeles, a city with a cultural mix of every nationality. The story begins when several people are involved in a multi-car accident. From that point, we are taken back to the day before the crash, seeing the lives of several characters, and the problems each encounters during that day. An LAPD cop (Matt Dillon) is trying to get medical help for his father, but he is having problems with a black HMO clerk who won't give his father permission to see another doctor. He in turn takes out his frustration on a black couple during a traffic stop. A socialite (Sandra Bullock) and District Attorney (Brandon Fraser) are carjacked at gunpoint by two black teenagers. Sandra takes out her anger on a Mexican locksmith who is changing the door locks to their home. Later that night, the locksmith is again robbed of his dignity by a Persian store-owner. Many of the characters switch from being bad-person-to-hero in ways that may surprise you.",/review/rw1231046/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2007,st-shot,4," Crash is a Wreck
","In Crash, Director Paul Haggis goes Altmanesque with this garbled attempt to discuss bigotry in contemporary LA. Overall it lacks Altman's energy and offers up gross clich√© characters instead of quirky originals. Crash begins to go into its spin right after Detective Weathers (Don Cheadle) sums up the ""City of Angels"" populace in the first line of the film. ""In LA nobody touches you. We're all behind glass and metal. Sometimes I think we crash into each other just so we can feel something."" We are then introduced to a full cast of impatient, ill tempered Angelinos of all stripe and persuasion connected in some way to make life miserable for each other. There's the bigoted cop, the successful ""Uncle Tom"" black, the Asian trafficking in human cargo, the hard working Latino, the misunderstood Persian and gang banger of principle. It's LA as a microcosm of the world, Hollywood style.",/review/rw1231046/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2005,hokeybutt,4," An Unrelenting Parade of Ironies
","CRASH (2 outta 5 stars) I was really expecting to like this movie... there is a lot of great acting in it and some provocative dialogue and I generally love ensemble-type movies like this. So why did this movie irk me so much by the time it was all over? Maybe it was the piling on of one contrived coincidence after another. After a while I was not having the ""oh-wow"" reaction that was surely intended... but more like ""oh-good-grief"". Plus the unrelenting parade of ironies wore out its welcome after the first thirty minutes. Okay, fine, we get it... people are not ""good"" or ""bad"" but they all have *both* goodness and badness in them... you can stop hammering that point home now! After awhile it just started to ring false... like we were no longer eavesdropping on real-life situations but viewing the work of a biased sociologist who is manipulating the facts to support his thesis. So many scenes just didn't seem very realistic: the Persian man grabbing the gun and going after the locksmith, Ryan Philippe's overwrought reaction to a hitchhiker, even Sandra Bullock's sudden realization of who her ""real friend"" is seemed false. (Aside: we really didn't need to have Sandra's character come out and SAY that her housekeeper was the best friend she's got... the weepy eyes and the the hug was enough, okay? A little more subtlety at times like this would have definitely helped the movie.) And have I mentioned the music yet? Oh please, please, please, make it STOP! That pretentious ""angelic"" score just kept grating on my nerves the more I heard it. The movie is not all bad. Ludicrous's character steals the movie... personally I think they should have just followed him and Larenz Tate around for 2 hours and ejected some of those other subplots. The bedtime scene with the locksmith and his little girl was very sweet and touching in itself but I felt it was enormously cheapened by the later confrontation with the shopkeeper... it was no longer a scene about the characters but merely a ""set-up"" for a (contrived) ""pay-off"".",/review/rw1231046/?ref_=tt_urv

28 February 2006,awalter1,3," aesthetically and intellectually offensive
","Contrived, self-conscious, obvious, repetitive, manipulative, heavy-handed, pretentious--apparently these qualities do not count against a film today, at least as far as critics and major awards organizations are concerned. Roger Ebert called ""Crash"" his favorite film of 2005, and the Academy Awards gave the film more recognition than I would have thought possible--even considering the large quotient of lowbrows in Hollywood today. To put it as kindly as possible, ""Crash"" presents us with a shockingly manipulative story and treats delicate social issues with all the subtlety of sledgehammer blows. In essence, it is a bad knock-off of John Sayles, and you would do much better treating yourself to a very fine film like the criminally-neglected ""City of Hope"" (1991) or ""The Sunshine State"" (2002).",/review/rw1231046/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2005,The_Void,4," With more cheese than a dairy farm, Crash will repeatedly slap you in the face until you swallow the all too obvious message, sideways. Racial segregation is bad. GOT IT??
","So, what do we need to make a successful movie these days? Racial themes? Check. Lots of names, including Don Cheadle? Check. A message that any idiot can understand? Check. Heavyweight performances? Check. Many intertwined stories? Check. Searing music? Check. A screenwriter with a recent hit already under his belt? Check. So then, I guess Crash is all set for an onslaught of rave reviews - which, of course, it got. Don't be expecting one here though; I'm not fooled. To be honest, I'm sick of average films like this garnering all the credit that should have been saved for real masterpieces. It seems that all you need nowadays is to make people think that you're making them think and you've got an instant hit. The message in 'Crash' isn't portrayed - it's forced. With all the subtleness of a sledgehammer in the face, writer-director Paul Haggis forces the fact that society segregates different races. In fact, despite all his forcing - there actually isn't a message here. There's people helping other races and judging them before knowing them, but never a definite message; thus suggesting that the lecturer doesn't actually know what he's talking about.",/review/rw1231046/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2005,dfranzen70,1," Avoid it - it's an insult to anyone's intelligence
","Crash is about thirty-six hours in the lives of various, disparate people in Los Angeles, told as a series of interconnecting vignettes. Some of the people are good, hardworking souls just trying to scrape by, and others are bad people bent on destruction and menacing. By the end, though, some of the good people have done bad things, and some of the bad people have done good things. And they all grew as people as a result.",/review/rw1231046/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2006,Ricky_Roma__,," A letdown (spoilers)
","I wasn't the least bit impressed by Crash. It's a film that tackles an important subject (racism) but it's a film that tackles it with two-dimensional characters, contrivances and sentimentality. In the end all it says is that we're all prejudiced in our own way and that prejudice is bad. Well, to anyone with half a brain that's hardly a revelation, but although the message is a little obvious and pap, I would be happy to embrace the film if it were well written and well directed, but it's not.",/review/rw1231046/?ref_=tt_urv

","When the lives of an L.A. cop, a half black couple, two black thugs, a rich couple, a black man whose mom favors his son, a middle easter shopkeeper, a Mexican mechanic and his daughter, and a rookie cop collide, there is no stopping the skid marks from appearing. This film was made in the style of one of my favorite films. MAGNOLIA. The different characters and they way they interact with each other just gives off that fresh cinematic feel. The film works very well.",/review/rw1231046/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2006,the_Poppuns,1," Wacky Comedy about La La Land
",And I mean to say it's about a fantasy world. I've never been to LA but I can't believe a major metropolis like the one in this movie exists in this universe or even in an evil parallel universe. The reason I describe it as a comedy is that it became that for me. Because very early in the film there are several moments that are so nonsensical that it kept taking me out of the movie. And once you begin to look at this movie sideways the whole thing becomes funny.,/review/rw1231046/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2005,marcosaguado,7," Clashing Crash In Devil's City
","Lives, ordinary lives, vital part of a city where, I'm sure, the devil has him home. Contradictory, awful, enlightened, confused. There are so many good moments in ""Crash"" that I felt the need to see it again less than 24 hours later. Matt Dillon lead us through his own contradiction with the humanity of someone who knows he carries something rotten inside. The explosive dissatisfaction that permeates Sandra Bullock's life is ferociously real and the frustration of Thandie Newton's character is a first on the screen. We've never seen it quite like that and her performance will stay with me. Larenz Tate personifies both sides of the equation, the one who understands but goes against his instincts, and still there are chilling flashes of innocence in his eyes -- his performance reminded me of the wonderful ""Seeds Of Tragedy"" were his innocence was intact. The problem with ""Crash"" and it is problem is that remains a rather shallow affair. Cleverly put together but epidermic at best.",/review/rw1231046/?ref_=tt_urv
