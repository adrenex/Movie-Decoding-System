8 October 2005,cdimdb,10," You'll never have me - but we can try
","Just watched this for the first time, and enjoyed it immensely. Some here have suggested that there's no 'real' story at all. I don't agree: Lynch doesn't work like that - no matter how bizarre and reticulated, there's a story there, all right, but you have to dig for it.",/review/rw3523430/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2005,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10," An incredibly well-done film... but not for everyone's tastes
","This is the first film directed by David Lynch I've seen, not counting The Elephant Man, which is another great film, but is an outsider in his career, since it is not surreal. This film is, however, making it the first typical Lynch film I've seen. And I'm honestly not sure what to make of it. I had heard a lot about Lynch's films before watching, but I guess I hadn't heard enough. I went into this film hoping for a good mystery, an interesting puzzle to solve. As the end credits rolled I didn't know what to make of what I had just seen. I didn't get an answer to the question I kept asking while I was watching; ""What exactly is this film about?"". As soon as the credits were over, I read a comment or two by Lynch fans... and the truth dawned on me. It's not supposed to be solved. It's not a movie where you, when you see the very end, exclaim ""Ah! Now I get it!"". This film won't provide you with some twist ending or have a character come up to the lead and explain it all. It's not supposed to make perfect sense or be easily explainable. It's not real. It's fantasy. Fiction. The whole film is like a dream, or, more appropriately, a nightmare. The film is great; it's just not for me. I won't let that affect my rating, however. This was an excellent example of masterful film-making. Lynch's direction is eminent, evidenced by the fact that I kept watching, despite not understanding half of what was going on or being able to sympathize with any character(something we are much too used to from mainstream movies). The lighting is great. Lynch really plays around with it, and it's always interesting to look at. It also really adds to the mood, nicely set by careful editing and music usage. The acting is flawless, and that is not a term I use lightly. All in all, a wonderfully well-done film, but definitely not for everyone. Wasn't in my tastes, but I enjoyed how well-made it was regardless. I recommend this to fans of art films, rather than conventional ones. Fans of Lynch should enjoy this. Very surreal and loose. 10/10",/review/rw3523430/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2018,gogoschka-1,10," Dark, Violent, Surreal, Beautiful, Hallucinatory Masterpiece
","Buckle your seat belts: this film is quite the ride. As so often with David Lynch's movies, 'Lost Highway' doesn't bother with a traditional narrative and follows its own, dreamlike (or nightmarish) logic. It is a wild, expressionist work of art, and while it starts on a slow, brooding note, the film soon explodes into a crazy, violent trip that hooks you competely and doesn't let up. My advice to people unfamiliar with Lynch's work is this: just enjoy the experience and let yourself be immersed. While it is fun to analyze Lynch's movies, especially his most surreal ones, they're not mysteries that require resolution in order to be enjoyed.",/review/rw3523430/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2004,Coventry,10," Weirdness overload!
","I believe it was the legendary Homer Simpson who once gave the ideal description on David Lynch productions. During watching a Twin Peaks'-episode he said, `Brilliantbut I don't get it'. Too trueyou love what you're seeing and you want to be a part of the mysterious Lynch universe! You actually feel the urge to search for solutions, you want to solve the riddle that is Lost Highway and you desperately try to do sountil you realize it's in fact a puzzle that cannot be solved. Therefore, my advice would be: Don't try to be Einstein and develop too many theories' just get overwhelmed by Lost Highway and enjoy the mixture of weirdness, violence and erotica you get to see. It's amazing what David Lynch pulls off here! He serves an absurd and impossible structure that involves an inexplicable metamorphosis of the protagonist and he actually gets away with it!! Meanwhile, he introduces a bunch of bizarre  but extremely fascinating  characters of which you don't know they're real or just creations of a mentally ill mind. Lynch in top-condition, in other wordsyou almost start to suspect he's laughing with his audience.  The quality of Lost Highway is brought up to an even higher level by the terrific musical score (Angelo Badalamenti), a blasting soundtrack (Rammstein!) and sublime acting. Bill Pullman and Balthazar Ghetty supply each other terrifically, even though they don't have ONE scene together. And Patricia Arquetteeither blond or brunette looks gorgeous. No wonder men in this film fall into madness over her. ",/review/rw3523430/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2010,claudio_carvalho,10," A Cult-Movie to Be Loved or Hated, but never Fully Understood
","The jazz saxophonist Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) is married with Renee (Patricia Arquette) and they live in a comfortable house. Fred is suspicious of the relationship of Renee with her friend Andy (Michael Massee). One morning, Renee finds a videotape on the doorstep of their house and when they watched the footage, they find that someone has broken in to film inside their house. They call the police, but the two detectives do not find any clue. Fred and Renee go to a party at Andy's house and Fred has a bizarre encounter with a mysterious man (Robert Blake) that tells him that they have met before and he is at Fred's house. The upset Fred calls Renee and they go back home. On the next morning, Fred finds another videotape and when he watches the film, he sees a bloodbath with Renee murdered in bed with him. He is found guilty of murder of first degree and sentenced to the electric chair. While waiting in the death row, he morphs into the efficient mechanic Peter Raymond Dayton (Balthazar Getty) and is released from the cell, but followed by two detectives. Pete fixes the car of the powerful and dangerous gangster Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia) and when he meets his mistress Alice Wakefield (Patricia Arquette), they have a love affair and the woman convinces him to escape with her from Mr. Eddy and travel to some other place.

",(Don't read this unless you want it explained). Fred found out that his Wife had done adult films in the past. She promised him she wouldn't do it again. He can't handle it. He's super stressed out about it and can only feel release through playing jazz and having frenetic sex with his Wife. His behavior freaks her out.,/review/rw3523430/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 1999,Drewski-3,10," It doesn't matter that the pieces fit.
","I started this film upon renting it one night at 11:00 PM.  I finished at about 1 in the morning.  I was so stunned and awestruck that I stayed up until 3 in the morning to watch it again.  This is one of the most spell-binding movies I have ever seen.  Each time I see it my theory of the plot thickens.  What I love about the movie is that it leaves you with the option to fill in the blanks.  You will keep asking what happened and why that happened, but that is what makes the movie so awesome.  David Lynch's skewed opinion of reality is very inspiring and I feel that my reality has changed ever since I watched it.  Having watched it 13 times I can pretty safely say that my theory of the plot is set, but I still love to ponder exactly why.",/review/rw3523430/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2019,Med-Jasta,8," Just watch it again
",The first time I watched this movie I enjoyed it but was left confused as to what was really going on. As a huge fan of Lynch I was expecting as much. So a few days later I watched it again and everything clicked and made perfect sense and seemed so obvious this time.,/review/rw3523430/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 1999,mst-2,9," An intense experience
","Clearly, as with most of David Lynch's films, Lost Highway is not for everyone.  It is, as Lynch intended it to be, a film realization of a dream. In this regard, it is comparable, in terms of artistry and raw intensity to Kurosawa's _Dreams_.  Indeed, in terms of sensory experience - cinematography and sound, for example - Kurosawa and Lynch have few rivals. However, the comparison falls away rather quickly in consideration of the film's content.  Lost Highway is really no dream, but a nightmare.",/review/rw3523430/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 1999,claybo76,9," An amazing movie experience
","This was the first time I was in anticipation of the release of a David Lynch film.  Having only discovered his movies (and Twin Peaks) in the period of 1992-1997.   I became a huge fan, owning several films on video as well as the complete Twin Peaks series.",/review/rw3523430/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2003,Troy2Slick,10," Very eerie, very disturbing, very nightmare-ish and very entertaining!
","I absolutely loved this movie. I have always loved to watch a good flick that puts my brain to the test. Maybe the film isn't suppose to make much sense, but that's what I love about it. You have to try and analyze it and make your own theories about what just took place. This movie isn't for a lot of people and I mean a lot. You have to like movies like Mulholland Drive, Memento, The Man Who Wasn't There, etc.. to even begin to like this one. I'm not necessarily a big David Lynch fan, but this movie rocked big time.

13 August 2004,knockpasheemore,9," For those, who try to understand the Movie
","First of all let me say, that it is not as serious, if you don't get the movies of David Lynch at once (or even never). Lynch is not a film maker who tries to make movies with a problem-solving message, but an artist. Moreover he started as a painter and so he tries to create an atmosphere more than to develop a story.",/review/rw3523430/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2013,Perception_de_Ambiguity,10," Cruise me, blonde - cruise me, babe
","As much as I keep thinking about the content of 'Lost Highway', every time I watch it I'm so captivated by its style and atmosphere that I never really analyze what makes it work technically, nor do I have much of a desire to dissect it. Even so I know that it is a film-experience that very much feels unlike any other, with pretty simple frame compositions that focus on faces in front of monochrome walls or black nothingness and on intricate empty spaces alike, visually beautiful because the images are impactful, and a sound design that never lets up with what almost feels like wall-to-wall music.",/review/rw3523430/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2015,asda-man,9," Dick Laurent may be dead but long live David Lynch!
","I make no secret about David Lynch being my favourite ever director. He makes films like no other by building dark worlds which draw you in by putting you in some sort of spell. I love him so much that I put off seeing Lost Highway for over a year because it was the only David Lynch film I was yet to see. I was even considering not seeing it at all just so I could always have that one new David Lynch film, but then I thought that would just be ridiculous. Also, the revival of Twin Peaks was enough to pique my David Lynch anticipation meter to breaking point so I finally gave in and stuck in Lost Highway.",/review/rw3523430/?ref_=tt_urv

14 December 2006,dcw-12,10," Why does everyone think Fred did it? *****SPOILERS*****
","Someone said that Lynch has said that Fred was a schizophrenic murderer. Well yes, he either killed or had Dick Laurent killed. I don't believe he killed his wife. We see the evil mobster Mr.Eddy showing snuff films in his house where someone apparently is murdered in it on the TV screen. Which seems to represent true images. Why not just porno, of course it makes Eddy look more menacing but is that necessary? Showing the snuff film is not an accident, it is necessary to the plot. We see Arquette with the mobster watching the snuff film on the TV late in the film. She makes films for a guy she knows kills people on film, she is embracing him and letting him have his way with her We never actually see Fred murder his wife. In fact Fred in the video before he is punched by the police Fred clearly has no weapon in his hand and is in shock. Why leave the weapon out of the video if Fred killed his wife? Given the people she was in with why isn't it a possibility that unbeknownst to her she was put in a snuff film, murdered, and then brought back to her house so as to frame the murder on Fred? Fred comes home sees the body and could have very well been forced to play in the gore by whoever was behind the camera. Tape ends up with the police, case closed. ",/review/rw3523430/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2004,popeman89,10," Possibly the strangest film ever made.
","The thing that's great about Lost Highway is there is no absolute solution to the events in the film, everything about the film is open to interpretation and after you watch it you either need to thing and talk about it for a couple of hours or watch it again. In Mulholland Drive, people say that it needs to be watched twice to be fully understood. Lost highway needs to be watched about 3 or 4 time to be slightly understood and will probably never be fully understood. All the clues are there in the film but to include all of them to make sense is very difficult. However it is very rewarding to try and find out the meaning of Lost Highway.",/review/rw3523430/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2011,Rodrigo_Amaro,9," Visually great but a little bit lost with its lack of purpose. Here's another good work from David Lynch, an artist above anything else
","A saxophonist (Bill Pullman) and his wife (Patricia Arquette) start to receive anonymous video tapes of their house, and each time as each different tapes appear the content starts to change little by little. Their story gets more messed up when they meet a strange and sinister character (Robert Blake) that seems to know more about them than themselves and can be in two different places at the same time. What is revealed after that is the wife's murder by the husband who'll later be arrested, and while waiting for his death sentence simply disappears out of his cell and in his place there's a younger guy (Balthazar Getty). And from that it's a whole different story with different characters but somehow is connected with the earlier plot. Those who love David Lynch mysterious puzzles will love this classic.

11 August 2016,Horror-yo,5," Artsy fartsy no goodzy, sorry !
","There, that title alone is enough to get fans to cringe and generate torrents of seething hatred now. This film is a Lynch film, it is therefor a mystery/crime with a very strong emphasis on the mystery...and the crime. But in both cases, an extreme version. So extreme in fact is the mystery, that it never actually unravels its coherent meaning, for simply, there is none. This sounds all very seductive to the pseudo-intellectual, but for others this comes across as clearly lacking a coherence even within the incoherence, an order in the chaos attempted. This comes across as way, way too many sex scenes, unnecessary violence to cover up strong plot work, easily too much length, and ultimately an artist abusing his status in creating lazy and complacent pudding: it's sweet, it looks good, but it's amorphic. Shape cannot entirely replace content, and if the content is to be this sort of fantastic network of vistas and concepts then it should at least provide a certain understanding to its public, some light along the dark alley.
