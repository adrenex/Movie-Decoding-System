29 September 2022,Blue-Grotto,6," In a relationship with a Narcissist
","Feeding on attention whether it is positive or negative, the need to control others, manipulation, blame, and the absence of empathy; such are the signs of narcissism. Alice's boyfriend Simon possesses such traits in large amounts. In a rare moment away from him and in the company of her friends at a cottage in Ontario, Alice reflects on her situation. Noticing her stress, doubt, depression, and shame, Alice's friends attempt to open her eyes to the emotional abuse. However, Simon is not yet ready to let go of his possession.",/review/rw8850685/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,Xstal,7," The Anguish of Alice...
","You're with a man who's very subtly coercive, in a relationship that's vile and corrosive, playing tricks with how you think, makes you wither, narrow, shrink, this is no way to spend your days, no life to live. Time with friends gives you a chance to float, reflect, of how your mind has crashed and burned, become a wreck, with their help they catch your fall, assist the break with a large maul, evict the poison from your heart, with great effect.",/review/rw8850685/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,movieman6-413-929510,5," Thanks to the beginning director and writers, the story unfortunately remains a bit on the simple side.
","Alice, Darling is a new drama thriller directed by Mary Nighy. This is the first movie she has directed and has only directed some episodes of different TV series before this.",/review/rw8850685/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,thesnowgirl147,6," Could've been so much more
","The acting was phenomenal! Anxiety and trauma oozed off Anna Kendrick and the supporting casts' was no different in their roles; the antagonist gets maybe 5 minutes of screen time, but it's all he needed.",/review/rw8850685/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,zack_gideon,5," Has something to offer but it's too slow and simple
",I like the concept here of the vast difference between actual love and narcissistic control. Narcissistic personality disorder is when someone needs to control and manipulate other people to feel like they're human. They're basically lacking a soul and feed of others in a nutshell.,/review/rw8850685/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,kevin_robbins,6," Strong performances but didn't push the envelope as far as I thought it would
","Alice, Darling (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows a group of friends who decide to go on a girl trip to celebrate one of their birthdays. One of the friends, Alice, has a psychological and verbally abusive boyfriend she needs to lie to, to go on the trip. She spends the entire trip scares to death he will find out about the trip. As her friends discover what's bothering her they will do their best to help her overcome her fears.",/review/rw8850685/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,Tactrix,6," Not truly on point
","So this is a story about a woman that's in a controlling and emotionally manipulative relationship with a man. At least that's what it appears to be. And I say that because this story is so wildly unclear, and at best you're guessing. It's like they took a story, then cut out all the stuff that would explain what actually happened. And then stuffed it full of everything that happened between the stuff that happened. And rely on you to understand the plot without telling you any of the actual story.",/review/rw8850685/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,romanprv,5," Shallow - more shallow - Alice, Darling
","Without a doubt, abusive relationships are an extremely important subject of our time. If sophisticated and served with the required depth, even movies might clear things up and maybe even change things for the better. Sadly, this is not the case here. This movie's main flaws are in it's shallowness and clearly one-sided view on a very sensitive topic:",/review/rw8850685/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,benjaminskylerhill,8," A compelling yet incomplete directorial debut.
","Anna Kendrick really does give a career-best performance as Alice, a woman in turmoil and denial over her emotionally abusive relationship. Really, the whole cast is incredible, and the highlight of this film is the interactions between the three friends as they peel back the layers of Alice's abuse.",/review/rw8850685/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2023,Jo-Cino,3," Everybody acting UNNECESSARILY weird for ninety minutes. VERY
","First off, it took FOR. EV. ER to get to the point of the movie... secondly, are we really sure this movie just isn't about some girl who is completely out of her mind who created her own angst?? Unless i missed something, they did a really poor job of making the boyfriend seem verbally or even emotionally abusive... matter of fact, most of the the interactions they show of the couple actually make the guy out to be fairly nice, mild mannered, sometimes affectionate and fairly thoughtful.",/review/rw8850685/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2023,grantarp,," One note, though Kendrick is talented
","This movie is a bit one note altogether. For example, why is the Simon character so angry? It would have been more interesting if the roots of his anger were explored and perhaps he could have been made a more sympathetic character, or at least more human. Instead, he's just an angry guy and portrayed as a villain. But anger comes from somewhere. Sure, some people in this world are just straight out evil, I can buy that. But more often than not, everyone has some humanity in them, don't you think?",/review/rw8850685/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,Silicone54,1," Mind numbing agony for the audience
",Alice is stuck in a relationship with her boyfriend Simon who has low professional esteem and he apparently takes out his frustrations on her. He's never shown to be violent so we must assume the mental and guilt manipulation.,/review/rw8850685/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,FilmFanatic2023,9," A Powerful and Thought-Provoking Exploration of Abusive Relationships
","A powerful and thought-provoking drama that delves into the complexities of an abusive relationship. The film, directed by Mary Nighy and starring Anna Kendrick, is a raw and unflinching look at how easy it can be to become caught in the undertow of a bad romance.",/review/rw8850685/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,Joker415,7," Surprisingly Moving.
",I've always been a fan of Anna Kendrick and was not sure what to expect going into this movie.,/review/rw8850685/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,lub-08057,6," The ending is great
","I felt like I had to fill in a lot while watching this, though the acting is really good. The script was missing interaction between the lead and her partner, putting the bulk of the storytelling on Anna Kendrick's performance, we're mostly only given hints. Personally, I feel it would have had more impact to show more between these two characters to really drive home how awful and insidious is that kind of abuse. We're supposed to experience this as she does though, and as her friends do - never quite sure of what is happening, which is a good idea in theory but I'm not sure it worked. The parallel storyline about the young girl was good if a little too obvious.",/review/rw8850685/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2023,wcf-24838,6," Enjoyably simplistic
","Visually this film is beautiful. Story is where the entire idea falls apart. A story of a woman breaking free of an abusive relationship ought to have more excitement in my opinion. While the story hits the high points following Alice(Anna Kendrick) realizing that her partner is emotionally abusive and manipulative it does seem to fall short of actual drama. The most drama seems to come from the interpersonal drama of Alice and Tess(Kaniehtiio Horn). While nothing is wrong with that all of that drama is merely played for filler while Alice's partner Simon(Charlie Carrick) is left in the background. Yes the film does follow Alice along a sort of hero's journey, yet I feel it could have done better in suspense. The film, to me, lacks any discernable drama except for a short sequence towards the end.",/review/rw8850685/?ref_=tt_urv
