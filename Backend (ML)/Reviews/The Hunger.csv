28 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,10," Amazing!!
","As a huge fan of Marvel I'm a little biased because I pretty much like everything they put out. My bias aside, Daredevil is terrific! It's actually my favorite Marvel show (along with The Punisher). If you don't believe me just read through the reviews here and look at the ratings. Even the critics loved this. Charlie Cox and Vincent D'Onofrio were born to play Daredevil and Kingpin. They're easily the best part of the show. This is a show that you'll want to binge as quickly as you can, it's that good. It's too bad that Netflix couldn't renew their contracts with Marvel and they had to stop making the Netflix Marvel shows because every single one of them was great! Now that they're on Disney they can bring these wonderful characters back. They already started to with Daredevil and Kingpin showing up in other shows and they just renewed Daredevil for another season. Now they have to do the same for The Punisher, Luke Cage and Jessica Jones. At least bring them back into the MCU somehow. If you're a Marvel fan then this is a must watch!",/review/rw4537237/?ref_=tt_urv

21 August 2021,Supermanfan-13,10," Absolutely Awesome!
",Daredevil was such an incredible show! Charlie Cox (Daredevil) and Vincent D'Onofrio (Wilson Fisk) led such an amazing cast who were all at the top of their game throughout the entire series! It's too bad that Marvel and Netflix had to split up because they made some pretty special shows. All of them were great but Daredevil and The Punisher were easily the best of them! It's one of the best superhero/crime shows ever made and where all 3 seasons were great! There's really not much more to say that hasn't already been said about this amazing show so just do yourself a favor and go watch it!,/review/rw4537237/?ref_=tt_urv

","Let me start by saying Daredevil season 1 was so great it was the reason I got Netflix.Daredevil season 2 for me was ok,I really liked the punisher but I didn't feel much for the main plot.but wow season 3 ..I would probably get my memory erased to relive this masterpiece again...
Every character which is introduced has a proper backstory.you actually care about each and every persons motives.you get to choose who you like.i love great villians and this show delivers not one but two.Wilson Fisk from season 1 itself was very impressive and season 3 he delivers an exemplary performance,but the person who stole the show was bullseye,his character development was amazing and the action scenes were phenomenal.usually shows have plot holes ,directors don't really care to fill them up but this show had no plot holes.It was really amazing ,they went for a bit unexpected ending which I really liked.usually multiple villains ruin movies and shows but this they did it so well.lol,this is probably how been afflecks Daredevil movie should have been.Must watch :)",/review/rw4537237/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,lockout-59506,9," Another victim of disney
","The netflix marvel series were all awesome! Especially when comparing it to the trash disney is pushing out in the name of Marvel. Disney shut down these netflix series so they could take the characters an mash them up in their hot garbage. Such a shame. This is easily one of the best marvel series to be released to date. I have watched luke cage, dare devil and the punisher from Netflix several times over. The iron fist an jessica jones were alright and Ive watched both series but those characters didn't seem to pop like the these did. Even the defenders was a pretty decent outing. I wish netflix could have kept these series going kind of like how Sony has managed to maintain the reigns on the Spider-Man universe until 2050 or something like that.",/review/rw4537237/?ref_=tt_urv

","I seriously don't understand why Netflix would cancel this show. The writing was spectacular, the acting was phenomenal, the action scenes are just perfect, and so much more. I cannot even express my love for this show. I was a fan of the Flash and thought it was a good show until I watched this.

8 May 2016,lnvicta,9," One of the best live action comic book adaptations of all time.
","Daredevil is the kind of show that, even when taken out of context, is still a great piece of work. Even if Marvel wasn't associated with this at all, Daredevil would still be one of the best crime/vigilante dramas out there. It's just great storytelling elevated by its superhero backdrop, with classic characters like Wilson Fisk and The Punisher butting heads with Matt Murdock through insanely choreographed fight sequences (the best in Marvel history) in the dark, gritty streets of Hell's Kitchen. Daredevil shows the grimier side of Marvel for sure, not quite as disturbing as Jessica Jones, but there's a fair share of graphic imagery. It's never gratuitous, though. The violence is real and raw, and you believe the wounds Daredevil gets in his numerous altercations, painfully so. Every little detail is accounted for, from the functionality of Foggy and Matt's lawyer firm to the martial arts techniques used in the many mind-blowingly impressive fight scenes. It all works so well; the writing is sharp, sometimes slow and brooding but it always pays off, and it's character-driven without delving into soap opera territory like many comic book shows do (though the Elektra storyline comes close).

","As a comic books fan, I must say he's (Daredevil) one of the most complex characters. I loved it.

28 September 2022,niamhcostello-16921,9," AMAZING show and fantastic ending
","Such a good ending!! The fight scenes were great, and I'm glad at how the show finished. It was great characterisation that Matt didn't kill Fisk (even though I kind of wanted him too), and I love how Nadeem helped even from after he got killed. It was a good redemption arc for him, and it was nice that he was the one who caused Fisk's downfall. Loved seeing Matt, Foggy and Karen back together again working together. Wished we had more of that the rest of the season. Really want another season just seeing the three of them working together, with no drama or murders, just simple cases.

7 November 2020,classicsoncall,9," ""Lawyer by day, vigilante by night. Hell does that work?""
","On the strength of the Netflix series ""The Punisher"", I decided to give ""Daredevil"" a shot and I'm glad I did. Both series have incredible writing and really dig into the character of their protagonists. I think I liked Punisher just a tad better even if I rated both series the same, that's just a personal preference. And like ""The Punisher"", this review is based only on the first season which I just finished, so I'm open to further consideration. Starting out, it didn't appear to me that actor Charlie Cox was appropriately cast in the title role, but as the chapters of Season One rolled by, he grew on me as both Daredevil and alter-ego Matt Murdock. And if you've read the Marvel comic on which this is based, you'll know there's no separating the costumed hero from his origins in New York City's 'Hell's Kitchen'.",/review/rw4537237/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2018,Here_2_Review,10," This show....
","Daredevil is some of the best I have ever seen from MCU...particularly Netflix MCU! Season 1 and 2 are good and worth your time, but season 3...omg This season is a MASTERPIECE!!!! It does everything right and even better than the first 2 seasons. This new season really fleshes out every character so much more, Matt himself, Karen, Foggy, KINGPIN, Dex, holy cow! For villainous performances, D'Onofrio was BORN to play Wilson!!! He is even a better Kingpin than in the Spiderman Ps4 game! All Netflix Kingpin has to do is sit with a straight face and still look like he will choke a person out or put a head through a table at any moment. You do not see Vincent on Kingpin at all... This is the best role of his career! Before season 3 showed up, I knew NOTHING about Ben Poindexter in the world of Marvel as far as comics or whatever.. This show gives you Pointexter's entire backstory all at once, but so cleverly well done, omg! How it does it is a long process, but NEVER drags or takes you out of the show! How Dex is portrayed in this show, when he is in the spotlight, you somewhat give a crap about him. This season gives the audience who has never picked up a comic, like myself...all the help needed to learn way more about Matt, Karen, Foggy, etc in through the best performances I have ever seen in this show.. The character development is beautiful, the tone, everything. This season is just a beautiful flawless masterpiece! Almost puts the first two seasons to shame! BETTER BE A FOURTH SEASON!!!",/review/rw4537237/?ref_=tt_urv

","You know when you watch something and someone grows on you? Vincent D'Onofrio is a great actor his turn as a villain is fantastic, his presence is felt, even when he's just shortly seen like in season 2. But the main character, Daredevil and his two sidekicks - I didn't exactly feel them too much at the beginning. There was a certain blandness there. Maybe it wasn't Ben Affleck then and it is the role that is weird to say the least.",/review/rw4537237/?ref_=tt_urv
