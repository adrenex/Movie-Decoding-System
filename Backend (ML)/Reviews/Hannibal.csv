12 August 2010,toqtaqiya2,9," An engrossing film that takes one's breath away.
","Here we have one of the best films of the last decade. A war film that succeeds in showing what it's like to be in the armed forces nowadays. It was directed be the underrated Kathryn Bigelow. The focus is on American soldiers in the Iraq war. But it's not about them being involved in assaults or shootouts. Instead we're shown the lives of a bomb squad. Jeremy Renner is commanding as Sergeant First Class William James. He provides an excellent performance. So do Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty as his partners. They really do act like real soldiers. The Hurt Locker consists of a series of bomb threats that the team have to overcome. These are all thrilling, tense. What makes the film really shine, however, is its anti-war messages. In the tradition of Apocalypse Now (1979) and Come And See (1985) The Hurt Locker shows that people get hurt and killed in wars, even if they don't deserve it. It shows that the victims are just like anyone else except that they're in a war zone. The film doesn't directly criticize the American war effort. There are no discussions about whether the Iraq war is moral or immoral. Bigelow's direction is truly impressive. She certainly knows how to work with actors. The acting is obviously superb, and this is the film's greatest strength. Also notable is the cinematography by Barry Ackroyd. The war hasn't looked this realistic or this interesting in cinema until The Hurt Locker. The images captured are thoughtful and memorable. No wonder the film was the big winner at the 2010 Academy Awards. Some films that win Best Picture don't deserve it, but The Hurt Locker sure did deserve it. It's one of the best war films ever, and I highly recommend it.",/review/rw2217500/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2010,gelman@attglobal.net,10," A Movie to See -- Not to Enjoy
","Except for the first few minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" no film I've ever seen comes closer than ""The Hurt Locker"" to portraying the randomness, senselessness, brutality and -- yes -- the excitement of battle. With the exception of Ralph Fiennes who makes a brief appearance early in the movie, there are no stars and few recognizable actors in this story about a small group of men whose mission is to defuse improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Iraq. Frequently under surveillance, though not always certain whether it is by curious bystanders or enemies in civilian clothing, these men are at risk every moment they are in the field.",/review/rw2217500/?ref_=tt_urv

17 July 2009,Chris Knipp,9," ""The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug.""""--Chris Hedges.
","Already celebrated for its breathtaking realism in depicting soldiers and explosions, The Hurt Locker is being called ""the best Iraq war movie,"" with the qualification that the genre has been weak and the public response weaker. This is Kathryn Bigelow all right: macho men in dazzling exploits, exhilarating and always a little terrifying to watch, with adrenalin and testosterone spurting off the screen. If war is a drug, this movie could give you a contact high. Bigelow was obviously born to make a war movie. The only question is why she took this long to do so. Writer Mark Boal led her into it. He embedded with a bomb squad in Iraq, and came back with remarkable stories and a character to hold them together. He's Staff Sergeant William James, who's what in the genteel days of The English Patient was more commonly called a ""sapper,"" a combat engineer who specializes in demolitions, minefields, and the like. Bigelow wisely chose Jeremy Renner, an unknown and unglamorous actor, for this pleasingly enigmatic role of a man who may be closer to bombs and timers than to his own comrades.",/review/rw2217500/?ref_=tt_urv

","American soldiers in Iraq defuse explosives while dodging sniper fire. Lather. Rinse. Repeat. And so it goes on and on and on for a mind-numbing 13 hours or so. The central character is an arrogant jerk; the other characters are stereotypes from central casting. There is no plot - just random encounters with insurgents. The most annoying aspect is the camera work. There's a scene in this film where the hero complains about the shaky camera work in an adult DVD he has purchased. Well, if he could step back he would notice that the film he's in is all shaky camera work and incessant zooming. It's nauseating. Somebody please take away Bigelow's camera.

28 June 2009,agmancuso,10," A Perfectly Shattering Film Going Experience
","Kathryn Bigelow concocts a masterpiece of a film without tricks or gimmicks, at least none to be detected and that in itself is a triumph. Realistic yet poetic like the works of the great masters. It enters and fits a genre and at the same time is unique, unexpected. It shutters, moves and alters every sense, like a powerful drug. I saw it last night and I'm going to see it again tonight. Last night Jeremy Remmer came to speak to the audience in a face to face moderated by Sam Rockwell, great idea but it change my perception of Remmer in the film, of his character. Although he praised Kathryn Bigelow, he said things like ""I don't tell her how to direct and she doesn't tell me how to act"" Watching the film I felt that childish arrogance belonged to the character by his personal appearance showed it belonged to the actor. In any case, it works on the screen. A character you warm up to almost immediately in spite of his contradictions. Remmer will remind you at times of Robert Redford and others of Michael J Pollard. He is truly terrific so try to avoid his personal appearances not to contaminate that impression. The rest of the cast works wonders and the brief cameos by Guy Pearce and Ralph Finnes are the most organic and unobtrusive cameos I've ever seen in my life. All in all extraordinary. I predict, even if we're only in June, that Kathryn Bigelow risks to be the first female director to win the Academy Award. She certainly got my vote.",/review/rw2217500/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2009,carlostallman,10," The Brilliant Explosion Of Kathryn Bigelow
","I spent the entire film grabbing the arms of my seat. I was there in Irak, steps away from my death and the death of those around me. The tension, the suspense is at times breathtaking, literally. ""The Hurt Locker"" is a miracle and the definitive consecration of a great filmmaker, Kathryn Bigelow. This is also a rare occasion in which I went to see the film without having read a single review or knowing anything about it. One should try to do that more often because the impact of the surprise translates into pure pleasure and in this case, sometimes, you have to look away from the unmitigated horror. Jeremy Renner is a real find. He is superb. A kind soul, wild man with enough arrogance to make him appear reckless and yet his humanity precedes him. People may commit the mistake of avoiding this gem thinking that it's just a war film. Don't. It isn't. It's a great, engrossing film about human emotions, not to be missed.",/review/rw2217500/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2011,qormi,," Not so great.
","The Hurt Locker won Best Picture, so expectations were high. It was a disappointment. Why Renner was nominated for Best Actor, I'll never know. His performance was bland; typical of a CSI episode on TV. Steven Seagal could act circles around him. The film had its suspenseful moments, like will he get blown up or not? They milked this to the hilt. It should have been nominated for Queasiest Motion Picture. The plot was boring - just defusing bombs and dealing with snipers. The part where they faced a sniper in the desert was dumb. They spent the entire day looking at a stone fortification half a mile away. In reality, the soldiers would have simply called for an air strike and be done with it. The scene where Renner takes off and carjacks an Iraqi civilian to do justice on the streets of Baghdad at night was dumb, as was his decision to take his crew with him to look for the person who laid out an IED in narrow alleys in complete darkness. Renner's recklessness would never have been tolerated because by flagrantly violating rules, he put his life in jeopardy as well as others. In the end, the characters were cardboard cut outs and didn't seem real.",/review/rw2217500/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2009,jaredmobarak,9," Spoken like a true wild man ... The Hurt Locker
","I was always under the impression that it would be another liberal propaganda-driven message movie like all the others coming out recently. To my great surprise, it was not. Rather than use the war to tell people already against it to protest, Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal decide to use Iraq purely as a backdrop to the real subject matter at hand—war itself. Plain and simple, war is hell, but it is also a drug each soldier feeds on, an adrenaline rush that makes him wake every morning to see what may happen. We are thrown into the action as Bravo Company's bomb team has just 38 days left in rotation. Let's just say the day doesn't end well and the final month has its ups and downs showing the world what is going on over there—the pressure, the friendships, the duty, and the loss.",/review/rw2217500/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was expecting something insanely brilliant and what ended up happening is I landed on a landmine. What a travesty that James Cameron's, ""Avatar"" the highest grossing film of all time; a film in which his direction has transcended film and technology that will effect people for years to come. I liked every movie that was nominated better than ""The Hurt Locker,"" hell I'd rather go sit at ""The Foot Locker"" trying on some shoes while watching the movie ""Up"" now that would be a much better experience. It just goes to show how stupid this whole process has become in some instances where everyone feels the need to give someone something that doesn't deserve it. I am very, very disappointed. The writing in this film was... just so, so, the acting was decent, the directing was decent... the story... was okay... but that's it; the only thing people will remember about this film is the fact that Hollyweird decided to give an award to a woman for being a woman... isn't that racist?

28 July 2009,WriterDave,9," Bigelow Detonates All the Right Marks
","Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) is the ""wild man"" team leader who has defused more than eight hundred bombs and has built his reputation on being an adrenaline junkie in order to mask his inability to cope with the emotional connections he feebly tries to make at home and on the job. Sergeant JT Sandborn (Anthony Mackie) approaches his work with a by-the-book stoicism that can't comprehend the recklessness of James. Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) is highly trained but still feels overwhelmed by his morbid thoughts on war and his role in it. These are the members of the EOD Army bomb squad stationed in Baghdad in 2004, and ""The Hurt Locker"" is their story.",/review/rw2217500/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2010,Dogwhiz,10," Strong contender for best movie of 2009
","Quite easily the best movie of 2009 and the best war movie since Black Hawk Down and maybe even beyond that, The Hurt Locker does something that few other war movies seem to be able to do. Rather than focusing on rapid-action combat scenes and the oh-so-emotional mental breakdowns that all soldiers seem to dramatically endure in Hollywood (Platoon, much?), it emphasizes the relationships of soldiers and the intensity of everyday living in Iraq– intensity that doesn't diminish when the guns are holstered. And that's where you'll see the real difference.",/review/rw2217500/?ref_=tt_urv

10 April 2010,the_wolf_imdb,1," So THIS is supposed to be the movie that beaten Avatar?
","I have read a lot of criticism from soldiers. I'm not an solider but I have some knowledge of military tactics and some common sense too. The movie is ""disconnected and detached"" as some may say. It is more collection of action scenes than story that has real sense, there is very little psychology, some bizarre lines. But it is incredibly illogical. For example the ""sniper scene"": Insurgents are hidden in the house. You are on top of the ridge. This is bad spot of course and the first US guy gets killed. The other takes the same gun on the same place and STAYS here for hours. This is very bad decision of course! The ridge is on the east, the house is on the west. You stay on the ridge until the sunset - sun shines directly into you face which means you cannot see anything but the insurgents must see reflection of your scope lens very clearly. This is very strange. In another scene you see team of three pyrotechnics searching building which has only recently been abandoned by insurgents - very dangerous! In later scene these three guys try to find insurgents in the buildings during the night - they even SPLIT and try to find them INDEPENDENTLY. This is not only risky, this is just plain stupid. Stupid. I just don't believe that US soldiers are so dumb and so badly trained. The script is unbelievable, pure B to C grade! I have no idea how this crap won so many Oscars - is it because of its ""anti war ideology""? I have been very disappointed by this movie.",/review/rw2217500/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2009,ptb-8,9," Bad title, great film.
","Well, here's my vote for what might turn out to be the best war or war related film so far this century. If you seek an Afhganistan experience that humanizes the 'war effort' and its suburban impact there and here, THE HURT LOCKER is it. Jeremy Renner is a strange new-ish actor, I have never seen him before but felt as though I had. He reminds me of Daniel Craig. Or maybe Craig's younger brother. I see today that Renner in in the running to play Max Rockatansky in MAD MAX 4 FURY ROAD. He is not suited for that but his suitability for the role of bomb defuse expert in THE HURT LOCKER is truly terrific. Strong guest appearances from Guy Pearce and Ralph Feinnes helped raise the budget cash and the international sales, I am sure even their roles are tiny but effective. Renner though is spectacular. I am not impressed with Kathryn Bigelow's previous directorial efforts but she has presented here with this film a redeeming result. Much of the hand held camera-work mars the quality and interest in the film, some of it downright irritating. However for a 2 hour war related film about the seductiveness of the adventure of war and its impact on one man with a family back home, THE HURT LOCKER is a great film. the scene in the supermarket with him searching for breakfast cereal is majestic emotional understatement. The title is terrible and will have put potential ticket-buyers off. So take my advice, and go, and then settle in for an experience in tension and emotion and humanity.",/review/rw2217500/?ref_=tt_urv
