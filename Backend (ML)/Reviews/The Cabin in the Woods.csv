15 July 2014,gogoschka-1,," I understand it's not for everyone (and I might have a slightly twisted sense of humour), but to me, this is pure cinematic pleasure
","I just can't get enough of this film. This year alone I have already watched it 4 times (and the year isn't even done yet). It works on so many levels and is so much fun; the way the conventions of the 'Horror' genre are turned upside down, while at the same time the story transcends the mere spoof and satire and becomes something new, entirely original – just: Wow!",/review/rw2579970/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2018,Bored_Dragon,8," Original cliché
","If you are a fan of art drama or you simply don't like the horror genre, I can understand if you hated this. But for every true fan of horror, with at least a basic knowledge of at least cult horrors through the history of the genre, this should be a real joy. ""The Cabin in the Woods"" is a weird movie that can not be precisely genre determined. It gathers horror ideas seen countless times and turns them upside-down. Nothing in this movie is new, but the greatest thing about it is its ability to make something very original using totally outworn horror cliches. This is a parody and homage at the same time. It is a funny-scary movie with great visuals and even better dialogues and one-liners, and its pace and twists (even the predictable ones) will not let you get bored even for a minute. And the final revelation is at the same time one of the most ridiculous and one of the most awesome things I have ever seen on the big screen. It is not a masterpiece, but it is a real gem and I loved it.",/review/rw2579970/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2012,Matt_Layden,9," I FREAKING LOVED this movie!!!!
","The Cabin in the Woods is a spin on the horror genre from writer's Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard, without giving away the spoilerish parts of the plot, I'll simply say that it involves 5 friends who fit the horror movie stereotypes (Jock, Slut, Party-Guy, Nerd, Virgin) who go to a cabin in the woods to party and get away from it all. Trouble is, its never really safe to go to a cabin in the woods is it?",/review/rw2579970/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2012,champjohnson29,8," Either you love it or you hate it!
","I'm not a horror fan. Although, films pertaining to demonic possession scare me into a four year old, it's just not my taste. I'm also pretty late in watching this movie. I found it online and decided to watch since I had nothing else to do. I was kind of intrigued after seeing Joss Whedon's name in the credits for producing and writing.

13 October 2022,funnycommentor,9," MASTERPIECE
","The plot of the movie wasn't really interesting, because it looked like a basic teen slasher horror movie. Eventually, it was one of the most UNEXPECTED movies I have ever seen! The storyline was very well written, so clever and very innovative. The filming location of the movie was basic, just a small cabin in the woods, but I really liked it. The characters weren't very interesting nor well-developed and only some of them were likeable. The killcount of the movie was HUGE, all the kills were so bloody and I really enjoyed them. Of course it wasn't a really scary movie and it didn't had many jumpscares. In my opinion, it's definitely one of the most shocking movies I have ever seen and it has too many plot twists and unexpected scenes. Moreover, that movie has some comedic scenes and they were really funny those scenes. Overall, it was a really intense movie, especially the ending scene. Last but not least, the ending of the movie was EPIC. By the way, I really hope they're gonna make a prequel, because I loved that movie.",/review/rw2579970/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2012,oldman007,10," I loved it, but I can totally understand why people would walk out of the theater and find it terrible.
",I'm a big Horror Fan. I have been since I was a young child. I've never seen anything like this movie before. It's a combination of everything. It's taken everything from every other Horror Movie and thrown it all into this movie. But what is really impressive is the fact that the movie has it's own (original) plot.,/review/rw2579970/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2012,billygoat1071,8," A New Horror Camp
","The writers of this film stated that they didn't like how the horror genre has become. Full of unlikable characters that we don't care if they live or die. Cabin in the Woods sounds like a generic horror film with a generic premise and generic horror characters. When you see it closely, it's an intriguing high concept satirical horror film. It may look absurd but it's actually brilliant and smart. It has campy scares and some good laughs. Cabin in the Woods is an enjoyable horror film with an unlikely twist.",/review/rw2579970/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2012,jdesando,," A comprehensive shocker
","In The Cabin in the Woods, five college types and their RV visit a remote cabin for a vacation of freedom and relaxation. They are stock characters: Jules (Anna Hutchinson) the promiscuous coed; Kurt (Chris Hemsworth), the athlete; Marty (an outstanding Fran Kranz), the stoner; and Dana (Kristen Connolly), the good girl. After Dana reads an old diary, the red-neck Zombies descend and with them the clichés.",/review/rw2579970/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2012,cadillac20,9," One of the best, most original horror films in years
","The horror genre for me has been pretty mediocre for the past several years, and so I have pretty much ignored a lot of horror movies that have come out, with the exception of a few. However, after the buzz surrounding Cabin, I knew it was something I had to see. And sure enough, Cabin delivers in spades. It has everything a horror fan could want, from our favorite clichés to some fantastic surprises. Suffice to say, every horror fan should go see this.",/review/rw2579970/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2022,kevin_robbins,8," One of the rare Hollywood big budget horror films worth your time
","The Cabin in the Woods (2011) is a movie that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows a group of friends that decide to rent a cabin in the woods for a getaway. Little do they know the cabin is run by a government organization that has different plans for them other than ""fun.""",/review/rw2579970/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2020,briancham1994,7," This is how to do a parody
","After the ""parody"" movies of the 2000s comes The Cabin in the Woods, a lesson in how to poke fun at a genre while still telling a compelling story. It incorporates all the clichés of the horror genre but in a clever way that all ties together. Even when you think you know what's going to happen, the film goes off the rails and goes into completely new territory.",/review/rw2579970/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2022,jrhaven,10," An absolute masterpiece homage to horror movies
","This is one of my favorite movies so this review will be a little (ok, a lot) biased. I love watching horror movies and so before I went to see this film a friend of .one said ""it isn't what you think. It will surprise you."" Now, I went to see this movie thinking I had it all figured out. Despite my friends warning, I thought I had figured out the twist and would see it coming. Boy was I wrong. Within the first 5 minutes, what I thought was the twist was already revealed and the movie still played out with more twists, humor, and deaths than I could imagine. The movie is a bit explanatory at times opting to tell us what is going on instead of us figuring it out, but I feel it works because the entire movie is really like an introductory coarse on the tropes of horror movies.",/review/rw2579970/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2013,jimbo-53-186511,2," The most frightening thing about this film is its absurdly high IMDb rating
","Oh dear! Cabin in the Woods is so bad I hardly know where to begin. The film combines elements of other films such as Night of the Living Dead (the zombies), Saw 2 (cameras hidden in the house). Unfortunately, the execution of this film is nowhere near as good as other films in the same genre.",/review/rw2579970/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2018,thomasjay-2201,8," Oddly Brilliant
","A slow starter but packed full of mystery all o can say for this film is its worth a watch. Difficult to explain but completely original this was such a fun watch once we got going, Grim, dark and unusually funny it's fantastic. Understandable characters played fantastically the twist is fantastic. A true spin on elements of horror I highly recommend regardless of your personal taste on this genre. Overall a brisk and fun watch",/review/rw2579970/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2019,Java_Joe,8," Deconstruction and subversion of horror tropes.
","But I would expect no less from the mind of Joss Wheadon, the man that gave us ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". This is a movie that, like ""Scream"" did in the 90's, deconstructs horror movies in an entertaining and rather original way.",/review/rw2579970/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2012,jaguiar313,8," A bloody fun twist on the isolated cabin sub-genre
","If anyone knows how to have fun with pop culture horror conventions, it's Joss Whedon (Buffy The Vampire Slayer, The Avengers) and he and Director Drew Goddard craft a funhouse of a horror movie by doing just that. And we are happily along for the bloody fun ride. Cabin is a movie where the less you know going in, the better. So, I'll simply say that it starts out with the classic young partiers heading up to an isolated cabin scenario and then turns this horror sub-genre into something quite different and deviously fun. Aside from a really clever script and the fact that Drew Goddard knows how to craft suspense and scares, despite letting us in early on what is going on, we also get a bunch of likable characters (including Thor himself, Chris Hemsworth) to root and care for. This is very important to make a horror flick work and so many films today makes their leads unlikable jerks who we could care less about. We are only scared when we care what happens to the antagonists and here we do. We like this bunch of characters and it adds to the film's effect that we don't want to see them suffer the fate that has befallen them. And what a clever and cruel fate Whedon and Goddard have in store for their victims. And, in turn, providing a clever and inventive blood soaked horror for us. The FX are top notch and the performances from his cast, especially leading heroine Kristen Connolly, are good and help make the scenario work. The script provides plenty of scares and gore but, also gives us some tension-relieving laughs with Whedon's trademark sly humor. Everything is blended together well by director Goddard, who gets us primed and ready for the 'all hell breaks loose' final act. A real horror movie blast!",/review/rw2579970/?ref_=tt_urv

","Remember when Scream came out? People loved it - and not because it was the most horrifying and controversial scary flick ever released. It was a huge success because it gave fans of the horror genre something new. It made them laugh because it lovingly poked fun at a genre the fans knew by heart. Cabin in the woods takes a slightly different approach. Where Scream chose to laugh about dumb things people do in horror movies, Cabin decides instead to respectfully explain...well, everything - and making you laugh/scream while it does.

13 April 2012,Chris_Pandolfi,5," A Very Loving Hate Letter to Horror
","""I love being scared."" So said Joss Whedon in an interview with Total Film regarding ""The Cabin in the Woods,"" which he produced and co-wrote with director Drew Goddard. ""The things that I don't like are kids acting like idiots, the devolution of the horror movie into torture porn and into a long series of sadistic comeuppances. Drew and I both felt that the pendulum had sung a little too far in that direction."" When I first read that quote a few weeks ago, I wished Whedon had been there with me, for I wanted to shake him by the hand and thank him for publicly reaffirming what I've felt about horror movies for quite some time. But then I actually saw ""The Cabin in the Woods,"" and I couldn't help but wonder why I wasn't seeing things as he saw them. Something wasn't quite right.",/review/rw2579970/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2012,kalibeans,8," Not at all what I was expecting
","Not at all a fan of teenage slasher movies I was extremely skeptical about seeing this movie. However, seeing all the high ratings made me wonder if perhaps there might be more to this movie than what I had expected. So with an afternoon to kill I stopped in to see it on a whim. Absolutely not your run of the mill teenage slasher movie!! Hard to say much more without spoiling the truly bizarre and unique plot of this well made film. Well shot, very well written. Every horrific nightmarish ghoul you could possibly come up with and just enough humor thrown in so you are not pushed too far over the edge. Not for the really squeamish or feint of heart. A well spent afternoon, worth the price of admission and absolutely one you want to see on the big screen. Not a movie for children under 17.",/review/rw2579970/?ref_=tt_urv

","You can't make one movie that will appeal to everyone. Even within a genre there's always going to be people hating or loving something that the majority thinks is obviously the complete opposite. This isn't ""true"" horror, it does have a lot of comedy, it also has a lot of wit. There are quite a few nods and there are many little things ""hidden"" in the subtext or out in the open for people to discover. Even simple things as the ""running upstairs"" cliché gets a spin (or at least I think it does. But with Joss Wheddon on script duties, I'm pretty sure this was no mere accident).",/review/rw2579970/?ref_=tt_urv

14 April 2012,six2561,3," Spend your money elsewhere
","My husband turned to me as the end credits started rolling and said ""That was the worst movie I ever saw."" And I agree with him. It starts off OK as any cabin in the woods movie would. But it goes somewhere incomprehensible shortly thereafter. Whatever unfolds is without explanation. And if it's supposed to be a spoof of all previous horror films ever made (as some have said in other reviews) it is still a miss. Spoiler Alert: it's not scary at all! There is slasher blood, lot's of it. And zombies (I am so over zombies). I either missed or didn't understand what the big twist is many talk about. You know from the first scene of the movie there are people in charge of overseeing the cabin and all that goes on there. There was no twist. Period. It's just a stupid movie with no plot and no horror. And I'm sorry, but if you either love, like, or recommend this movie you are smoking way too much of that stuff Marty smokes. Do not go to see this movie if you are over 20. I give it a 3 because I did LOL a few times, so I guess I was mildly entertained once or twice. PS... The cameo appearance at the end is NOT by ""a horror movie icon"" as several have stated. Those are 2 completely different genres of movies.",/review/rw2579970/?ref_=tt_urv
