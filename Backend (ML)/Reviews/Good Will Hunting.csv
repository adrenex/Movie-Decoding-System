23 October 2018,Ed-Shullivan,5," Please bring back more great seasons of........... 1. The Wire ..........& 2. Major Crimes
","I really liked Missy Peregrym in her previous telvision crime/drama series (2010/2015) Rookie Blue, and there certainly is some decent on-screen chemistry with her current co-star Zeeko Zaki who recently appeared in the military/drama TV series (2017) Six. If this new TV series FBI is to not only survive but in fact thrive, the writers need to be a heck of a lot more creative with the storylines than just bring us one hour episodes about ISIS related criminals who simply just get shot dead by FBI agents in an effort to end the episode.",/review/rw5411165/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2019,umwolves,2," Can't even finish a season...total crap
","Missy P crying, literally, all the time. She is way to emotional. And why is Jeremy Sisto yelling all the time? I made it about 10 episodes...I can't do anymore. They have the exact same process each episode, and it isn't even like criminal minds where it is kinda interesting...I stop each episode 7 min from the end because that's the sappy emotional crap.",/review/rw5411165/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2020,PartialMovieViewer,1," At First, Seemed Good. But I Was So Wrong
","Several have already zeroed in on PC so maybe I shouldn't go there? Or - maybe I should? I noticed a common theme of the current batch of mediocre shows. They all seem to concentrate on agendas and/or PC messaging over trivial stuff like storyline or plot. It gets so irritating to watch shows with potential, just roll over and tank just because the social flavor-of-the-week is injected just for PC points. Is this a horrible show? Not really horrible, but no reason to sit in front of the TV.",/review/rw5411165/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2018,mephistox2001,2," Unconvincing
","All the FBI characters were wooden, one dimensional and unconvincing. The ""civilians"" were somewhat better. It looked like it was going to be an interesting show; however, it was quite boring and rather pointless.",/review/rw5411165/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2019,sulthar-15292,1," Political beyond the limit
",Why is it that every white male is either stupid or evil? The political message is not even tried to be hidden. Its annoying as hell.,/review/rw5411165/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2018,dehdave,2," Could it possibly be worse
","Simply running along as just another boring and predictable police procedural then they started getting political. They just couldn't resist. I'm out of here, not wasting another minute on this inferior product.",/review/rw5411165/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2020,Harbsa,1," Well folks now we all know that the FBI is actually just 4 people.
","1.Big Jubal AKA captain shouter. 2. A pretty black girl who makes NASA scientists look like imbeciles. (and I kid you not, this woman finds missing people, & solves IT crimes, in LITERALLY 5 minutes. Shouting Jubal gives her 5 minutes and before then shes done it.) 3. Then theres OA, whose a cool guy, doesn't do everything.. <--Well hes a man after all. And like shouting Jubal they have now super-powers.
4.... And then there is the utterly ridiculous pretty white woman. Who ... and again Im not kidding does EVERYTHING!! Her crime solving prowess make Sherlock homes look like an idiot. She heads up breaching teams, <-(While they all wear full body armour, she wears a bikini-kevlar vest.) She is the chief hostage negotiator in the whole on NYC. She is a world expert in every crime known to man. Kidnapping, homicide, GTA, Blue collar, and white collar crime. undercover...cattle rustling.. you name it. Oh and if anyone is needed to impersonate to infiltrate, yep shes the one.
They have hundreds of ""extras"" milling about in the ""FBI office."" BUT...What the hell these people are doing is anyone's guess.
This show could be good. As the actors, ( And that includes the two ""normal"" men, and two, as usual in this age, = super powered women.) Or at least the actors and actresses who play the parts. The sets. The costumes, etc, are all great.
However.. the writing utterly sucks.",/review/rw5411165/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2018,ninja-turtle,8," Started pretty shaky, but is much improved
","I was ready to write this show off after 2 episodes, but I glad I didn't. Someone must have heard all of the negative comments (mostly between me and my wife) around Sela Ward's and Jeremy Sisto's characters and how everything they did and said was WAY over the top. Starting in episode 3 they dialed their acting way back and the dialogue became more realistic and their actions more convincing.",/review/rw5411165/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2021,edlord,2," Started out with high expectations... now the reality sucks
","This show is such a disappointment. It started out well but now has turned into one long politically correct screed. After 4 Episodes of Season 3, our family is throwing in the towel.",/review/rw5411165/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2020,blueoysterdvp,8," A Tale Of Two Seasons
","Some viewers leaving comments here appear to be watching Season 2 only. If you have CBS All Access that can be understandable since they DON'T carry S1. For $10 bucks a month it should be available. Just watching S2 can get confusing if you haven't seen the much better Season One minus the ""Most Wanted"" episode. That episode was the Pilot for ""FBI: Most Wanted"" and not very good. The First Season of FBI was more suspenseful with better writing and plots. The same could be said for the characters. Where's Ian Lim been lately played by James Chen? A much better character than what looks like his replacement Kelly Moran played by Taylor Anthony Miller. Not a good replacement so far. Hopefully Chen comes back. A big loss for the show. Sela Ward as Dana Mosier was leaving after Season One no matter what. A huge loss. Her replacement Alana De La Garza as Isobel Castile has been a hit or miss affair. Horrible in S2 E1 ""Little Egypt"", better in every show after. Still no Dana though. John Boyd as Stuart Scola has been bringing S2 down. Why his ""Barney Fife"" character hasn't been written off the show is a better mystery than some of the S2 plots. His new partner Emily Ryder played by Catherine Haena Kim has been solid so far. She has a future in acting. Why Kristen Chazel (Ebonee Noel) was taken out of the field as Scola's partner is baffling. Maybe due to the absence of Iam at headquarters? S2 is not S1 yet. It's not bad either, though uneven. Viewers that don't watch or like FBI are going to give those One Star ratings that don't make sense. If it's a bonafide 1 Star show it would've been yanked off the air after 5 shows. For those folks, don't watch this show. If you watch more than 3 episodes such a low Star rating doesn't make sense.
Anyway, I hope FBI gets back to the S1 caliber of writing and acting. After that ""Most Wanted"" episode in S1 I saw a giant Red Flag. ""Little Egypt"" S2's first episode was another flag. Hopefully they continue for the better. Maggie and OA got me interested in FBI from the start. The acting chemistry is there. Now give them the surrounding plots and characters that made S1 so good CBS. Put S1 on All Access too while you're at it!",/review/rw5411165/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2019,rudygerst,1," Congratulations! You're the 100000th show about this

29 September 2018,passuear,1," Just plain bad
","Man this show is a hard watch. The writing is so bad. Everyone's so serious too. Like there's any group of people in America who have no humor in their work. Then they have the scene at the beginning where the building is blown up a second time and the mother is blaming the FBI agent for her son dying. I had no clue why she was doing that. I know she was clearing the area, but it seemed like they were trying to create a scene with cliche lines from a mother with a dead son. The whole jgh do you have kids, well then you wouldn't understand. This whole episode felt like someone at CBS lost a bet and had to air it. No one could have purposely aired this show thinking it would get ratings if they had seen it first. Impossible.",/review/rw5411165/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2019,spokanegolfer,3," Allegince episode has no sound!! Social media bullying!
","Allegiance episode has no people sound!! It has background and supporting sound, but no people sound!! While I am willing to try to read lips, not all speakers are shown! Very disappointing! OMG!! Some guy is talking to a auditorium of college students. He says that white people shouldn't apologize for being white and that they shouldn't apologize for being male!!! Somehow, the show turns this into WW 3 with protests, demonstrations, and all out bullying of White people!! This war on white people is extremely unhealthy and evil! Celebrities and politicians call for the death of white people and the media, including this show, keep the madness going!! As a veteran, a patriot, and a hard working America, this is BS, & I've had enough!! Take your bullying elsewhere and quit spreading your lies and propaganda!! Sig 220 isn't 9mm!! Perhaps this show should stick with Nerf if they don't know anything about firearms!!!!",/review/rw5411165/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2019,Samthesham67,6," OK....but the SHOUTING!!!
","Not a bad series, started well with a reasonably strong pilot but dipped a little with the nuclear reactor story, quite boring. Characters are a little wooden and need a little more body, like interesting back stories and personal lives. With that in mind, the potential is there for an interesting series, but Jeremy Sisto has to stop shouting all the time, it comes across as very amateur and it's extremely annoying.",/review/rw5411165/?ref_=tt_urv

10 October 2018,lesliejphillips,10," ""Prey"" A Breakout Performance For FBI Characters
","Although the first two episodes of the pilot, FBI, were very good, the characters stood out more as individuals than as a team.
In ""Prey"", they played off one another much better and there was much more emotion in their performances. Especially Jeremy Sisto, who was fantastic in Law & Order, but who has a much different role as floor team leader Jubal Valentine in FBI.
Missy Peregrym has been the strongest character from the beginning, but this episode allowed her to show more emotion and humanity than the previous two episodes. Same goes for her partner, Omar Adom played by Zeeko Zaki - as well as their dependence on one another as partners.
Another standout character is analyst Kristen Chazal, played by Ebonee Noel. She is smart, quick-witted and her special talents compliment the team very well.
Looking forward to further character development on this promising new show.",/review/rw5411165/?ref_=tt_urv

14 November 2018,lovettstough,1," Terrible!
","This show is simply terrible! I see it going the same way Chicago Justice did. They'll let this season play out and it will not be back I hope. Dick Wolf other shows Law and Order SVU and Chicago Fire, Chicago PD, and Chicago Med seem much more realistic and base some or a lot of their stories from real stories from headline news. FBI is not realistic at all. The most recent and last episode I watched had a war hero with extreme PTSD and the character Maggie shamed him said all kinds of terrible things about him. The one thing she said that was not true is he did not betray his country, he served his country and was a POW and received multiple accommodations/awards and was a war hero. What he did after his time in the service is unrelated and he may have betrayed his family and friends and shamed himself but he did not betray his country.",/review/rw5411165/?ref_=tt_urv
