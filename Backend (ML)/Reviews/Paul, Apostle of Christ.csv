25 December 2010,Movie_Muse_Reviews,3," The same tired old jokes and cliché miscommunication story lines
","Quality comedies -- if they go beyond one sequel -- never come in  threes. In the case of ""Little Fockers,"" three's a Focking mess. But we  asked for it; ""Meet the Fockers"" ranks as the highest-grossing  live-action comedy in the U.S., so regardless of quality, we were going  to get whatever studios served us. And sure enough, ""Little Fockers""  cooks up tired modern gags, basically forgetting that the last decade  of comedy (including its two predecessors) ever existed and that we  could be won over by open mentions of sex (ooh!) and recycled dick drug  gags.  It's several years later and Greg and Pam Focker (Ben Stiller and Teri  Polo) live in Chicago with their twins, Henry and Samantha. Grandpa  Jack Byrnes (De Niro) has grown concerned over the Byrnes family legacy  as he's been having some heart issues lately and his first son-in- law,  Dr. Bob, has failed him after having an affair and getting a divorce.  As such, before he and wife Dina (Blythe Danner) arrive for the twins'  birthday, he tells Greg that he's ready to pass the torch to Greg,  who's eager but still scared about winning Jack's full approval and  becoming ""The Godfocker.""  The film focuses on Jack and Greg again, as expected, so among other  faults, the title ""Little Fockers"" is misleading. The kids are hardly  in the picture expect for cheap jokes and they're neither cute nor  talented. In a family dinner scene where Greg (with ""Godfather"" music  in the background) commands that Henry eat his lasagna, Henry succumbs  but then spews vomit all over his father. Whenever the film seems to  breeze about with a bit more of a sense of humor, a tasteless joke  shoots in that prompts us to do the same.   Contrivances and predictable story lines litter ""Fockers"" and damper  the occasional moments of humor. The familiarity we have with Greg and  Jack helps create that humor and some clever jokes actually do exist,  but the script leans on typical ""misunderstanding"" plot devices, most  of which were ironically used most effectively in ""Meet the Parents""  and ""Meet the Fockers."" The whole idea of ""if they worked once they'll  work again"" does not apply. The ""twists"" of this film are set up so  conspicuously that as they unfold, it's like you know what happens  because you've seen it before. And you likely have, because there was  probably something similar in it from a previous ""Focker"" film.  Outside of Jack spying on Greg, who tries to keep it a secret that he's  trying to make extra cash by pushing a new erectile dysfunction drug  for a gorgeous drug rep (Jessica Alba), all the side characters and  plots are garbage. Owen Wilson returns as Kevin and the running joke  other than him being some rich worldly hippie is that he's in love with  Pam, which never amounts to anything. Alba over-ditzifies her part,  which should have been played by a nameless attractive woman, proving  she has no idea how to shake her type.  Even Bernie and Roz Focker (Hoffman and Streisand) are out of place,  squeezed in to appease the audience who expects them to show up. It's  actually unfortunate, because neither of them totally overdo their part  or annoy us with the fact that despite the same thing happening for the  third film in a row now, no one's learned their lesson. Greg actually  catches Jack spying on him on the train and after eight years of  knowing each other, Greg doesn't confront him. Sure this was for the  sake of keeping the tension up, but at some point you can't keep  milking the same goat, or cow, or cat. Yes, Jinxie returns, also with a  convenient line of dialogue from Wilson who says ""I had her brought in  town for you when I heard about your heart,"" just to set up another pet  mischief joke that's completely out of place at the end of the film.  Basically, we're Focking tired. ""Little Fockers"" is simply another  example of a movie concept that's run its course and should have never  gone beyond two films and only did because of the money. In a sense,  there should be no surprises here. Then again, attempted jokes such as  young Henry randomly asking if girls poop from their vaginas at the  dinner table, could have been replaced with something more thoughtful  -- and tasteful.  ~Steven C",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2010,jdesando,," Let's hope the little fockers know it's time to terminate the franchise.
","Because there are no big issues at the Little Fockers house, little issues drown it in nonsense so that humor can barely breathe. Patriarch Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) thinks his problematic son-in-law, Greg (Ben Stiller), should be his heir to the ""godfocker"" role. Greg (previously in life named ""Gay' for Gaylord) accepts and spends the rest of the film showing he is not qualified for the responsibility.",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2014,SnoopyStyle,6," Not that funny and should be called 'The Godfocker'
","Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) is more successful, and drug rep Andi Garcia (Jessica Alba) is proving to be a beautiful temptation. Jack (Robert De Niro) is distressed after Dr Bob left Debra and he has a heart attack. Jack decides to anoint Greg as the Godfocker. However, the return of Kevin (Owen Wilson) and the beautiful Andi leads to misunderstandings, doubts, and conflict.",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2010,freemantle_uk,3," Oh just fock off.
","I would love to become a film writer/director, but I often suffer self-doubts on whether I can write anything good or come up with a good idea. Weirdly Little Fockers gives me hope because I know that least I try hard with an idea and do not settle for less like the writers of Little Fockers.",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2010,dtucker86,," What a FOCKED up excuse for a movie!
","This was one of the movies that I was most looking forward to seeing this year and it turned out to be the WORST movie I have seen all year! What were DeNiro and Stiller thinking? Let me rephrase, what was ANYONE thinking who had anything to do with the making of this wretched bag of dreck posing as movie. Back in 2000, Meet The Parents was looked upon as one of the funniest movies ever. I remember that the editorial page of my hometown newspaper even praised it. Here, they have just disgraced themselves. Apparently the movie makers thought it cute to show a little child being injured and someone slashing themselves cutting the turkey. Oh and also, the scene where DeNiro takes that Viagra drug and it shows him with a huge bulge in his....oh never mind. I want to tell the screenwriters that bad taste does not equal funny. DeNiro has earned his place as one of our greatest actors and he should have known better agreeing to this. He merely embarrasses himself as everyone else who made the film did. They should hang their heads in shame.",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2010,duckfeetpro,3," It just wasn't funny...
","Okay so you know the premise with these types of films, you've got your father in-law and your son in-law arguing while the rest of their family watch them get into zany situations. Being such a used formula, you can guess what's going to happen, this isn't a problem with comedies as their jokes are what hold them up, right?",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2011,paul_haakonsen,5," A notch down in speed and laughs...
","""Little Fockers"" pretty much follows in the footsteps of the previous two movies about the Byrnes and the Fockers. So if you enjoyed those two, then you will definitely enjoy this one as well.",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2010,doorsscorpywag,1," Focking awful
","What a jolly jape making another movie with Focker in the title because, hilarity upon hilarity, Focker sounds like something rude so we must laugh. Except we don't really as this series of films has dredged the barrel bottom clean for a second unfunny sequel to complement something that was not that funny first time round. The gangs all here again to perform a series of unfunny sketches unfunnily and leave the audience paralysed with laughter. Well paralysed at least if they don't get up and do something more interesting like repoint their sewage system. Robert DeNiro used to be one of the finest actors ever to hit the screen and that's all you need to know about this pile of putrid puss. As long as people troop in and titter at the Benny Hill style double entendre of people called Focker then there will be no doubt be a fourth probably called 'something something mother Focker something' which will send us apoplectic with mirth.......or not most likely. The silliest Fockers of all have to be the audience for this tripe. Luckily I saw it for free and I thought I was robbed. They may not make films like they used to but they still churn out utter garbage like this year in year out so prepare for more Focking Fockers in the near future. Makes you Focking weep!",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2011,mark.waltz,1," Pointless sequel with too many groans, not enough gags.
","Not really a fan of the first movie, I reluctantly watched ""Meet the Fockers"" because of the addition of Streisand and Hoffman as Ben Stiller's parents. Their presence for me was the saving grace of that film, and even though it was rather silly at times, I found it to be really enjoyable. When the third part of the series (and hopefully the last) came out, my friends all warned me to stay away, as did the critical bomb it received. Finally, I broke down and watched it on DVD, and I felt that I had to fumigate my DVD player for all of the gross-out gags it contained and unlikable characters. I found DeNiro's Jack a bit mellowed in the second film (still stuffy, but more human), yet in this film, he is back to the unlikable King Lear he was in the first film. How the beautiful Blythe Danner could stick with this guy is beyond me. She still radiates sophisticated gentility (the epitome of what Dixie Carter on ""Designing Women"" describes as class: making everybody feeling comfortable) and comes off unscathed.",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," The kids are alright.
","Though 'Little Fockers (2010)' is clearly the worst in its series, it certainly isn't as bad as it seems most people perceive it to be (one reviewer even signalled it as a ""depressing experience"" that evokes an ""overpowering sense of sadness""). Sure, it's contrived and derivative. However, it's also relatively fun. It's an easy-going comedy that provides a cast of charismatic characters, a heap of misunderstandings and a handful of chuckles. There may not all that much to say about the feature, but that doesn't mean it's bad. It's enjoyable and well-paced, an amiable way to pass the time. Fans of the previous two films ought to be entertained, even if it is a step down. 6/10",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2010,bassrourke,4," A sequel that shouldn't have been made
","For a start the director of American PIE should not have been put in charge of this so far so good franchise. Meet the Parents has just finished with this installment. Ben Stiller is back with his ongoing shenanigans with father in-law DeNiro, but all to no avail You will see many Godfather references and Jaws references to name a few. Just terrible and all in all rude, obscure and down right awful humour. If you see this because your a Jessica Alba fan, your forgiven, but if you expect to see legends Harvey Keitel, Barbara Streisand or Dustin Hoffman on screen for more than about 15 minutes, forget it. Leave your brain at the door, this stupid movie may get more laughs when vacant.",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2011,dvigrad1,8," It's watchable. I really mean it!
","I watched this in a theater and I didn't regret it. Before that, I saw the ratings here and read some critics, and it was bad. I went to see it anyway, expecting nothing of it. If I could stand watching 2 hours long The Limits of control, I can surely stand the Little Fockers. And guess what, I liked it! I had a few laughs, the theater was full and everyone was laughing, so, I'm a little puzzled by all this negativity on IMDb. If you liked the first two movies, you will like the third one also. You know what you can expect of the Fockers, right? The same old story. I would recommend to everyone to just watch it (if you liked the others) and then make a judgment. This ratings on IMDb are so misleading, and makes you watch bad films, or not watch the good or the perfectly watchable.",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2010,medellinrob,7," Not bad as many think, just don't expect great!
","If it was a movie with intentions of being forever remembered and awarded with Oscars I would rate it 2/10 of course, but knowing it has been made for laughing, then it's a 7. I did laugh quite a bit, but it's not an 8 or 9 because some jokes are not my kind of humor or it's the same jokes as the previous movies in the series (with the last name and so on). Also, the plot is dull, like always, things don't work out for Greg and blah blah.",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2010,stephenhinton,1," It really is that bad....!
","So the third film in the hugely successful franchise as been thrust upon on us, but it is far from a welcome addition to the family.",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2010,tavm,6," Little Fockers starts out hilarious enough before struggling to maintain that tone straight through
","Having seen the first two films in the series and liking them, I was looking forward to Little Fockers with my movie theatre-working friend. The first hour was very funny to us both what with all the risqué jokes that entailed but started to fall apart by the time the Jessica Alba character started acting real drunk and stripping when she comes on to the married Ben Stiller character but there were still some funny lines and scenes after that, just not as much. So in summation, Little Fockers was mostly enjoyable but it's obviously run out of steam as far as series entries goes. Not to mention how that the last scene seemed contrived to set up yet another sequel...",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2010,PWNYCNY,9," What a hilarious movie!
","This movie is hilarious. The laughter is nonstop as the Robert DeNiro once again proves that he is one of the great actors of American cinema. Mr. DeNiro's portrayal as Jack Byrnes is brilliant and generates lots of laughs as he projects his distorted fears onto his hapless son-in-law who is completely overwhelmed. Everyone in this movie is funny. Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand showcase their comedy skills, especially Ms. Streisand whose portrayal of a Jewish grandmother television talk-show personality cannot help but produce laughs. The actors in this movie are so funny that they steal scenes from Ben Stiller who is a great straight man for all the other funny characters. Indeed, Mr. Stiller should be nominated for a Best Straightman Award. The misunderstandings around ""Andi Garcia"" are is source of much amusement as Jack Byrnes is busy investigating what to him is evidence of betrayal of the family, one of Jack's delusions, a take off on the Godfather theme. This movie is a must watch for anyone who likes to laugh and enjoys lighthearted comedy.",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2011,Howlin Wolf,1," Fock Off!
","""Little Fockers"" is a second sequel that remorselessly treads old ground, and not only that, such an uninspired approach had the negative side effect of making me realise how much I hated the characters - with the exception of the part played by Dustin Hoffman, who wasn't in it for very long because he made a wise decision! Bernie Focker aside, they are all deeply unpleasant and downright mean to one another, which is only tolerable when all of the rancour actually yields laughs. In this case however, it doesn't.",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2010,neil-476,6," Why hasn't Jack been locked up?
","This is the mixture much as before, really - demented ex-CIA father-in-law Robert De Niro pushing son-in-law Ben Stiller beyond any reasonable limits of endurance, with the usual friends and family chipping in here and there, and the added complication of two children and pharmaceuticals saleswoman Jessica Alba throwing herself (literally) at Stiller.",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2011,kosmasp,5," Little fun
","Robert De Niro seems to have found his comfort zone. At least in movies. Which is kinda weird, because he doesn't actually like doing press and he seems to churn out big comedies once a year (haven't actually checked if that is true). And while we got used to see him in movies that almost seem to diminish his previous great movie career, you wonder how they got Harvey Keitel to do this? ",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2010,DaynaSu,8," Typical Focker Fun...NOT FOR KIDS. REALLY!
","I can't help but be annoyed by all of the reviews poo-pooing this movie. What did they expect of a Focker film? Surely this is not going to be nominated for any Oscars...but I suspect that the demographic the filmmakers were catering to are not looking for a classy, thoughtful movie. They are looking for an escape from reality. They want to laugh.",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2013,g-bodyl,9," Well, I Liked This......
","I must be one of the few people who actually enjoyed watching Little Fockers. Granted, when I saw this in this theaters, I did not enjoy it all that much. But, the second time around, I actually thought this was a nice comedy with some extremely hilarious moments. Obviously, the first two films were better but this is a good end to the Focker franchise.",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2010,DICK STEEL,6," A Nutshell Review: Little Fockers
","It's been 10 years to this date when a friend and I were jaded over an increasingly commercial Christmas period, that we decided to skip meaningless countdowns, and opted to catch Meet the Parents in the cinema instead. An excellent choice, as the film turned out to be a riot, with Robert De Niro just about embarking on a career shift in doing comedies. And who can forget how the film introduced (at least to me) the much mimicked and spoofed ""I'm Watching You"" hand sign?",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2011,witster18,6," criminally under-rated... strides better than the last one... genuinely funny
","They did a great job here with a script that addresses the fact that the joke is getting old... in fact, ""Little Fockers"" often makes fun of itself. It's a light-hearted approach that works. The second film really got lost in all the new characters and just wasn't very funny. This film IS funny. I laughed out-loud several times, and usually a chuckle is all you'll get out of me. This is a sequel that is very aware that it's a sequel, and tries very hard to keep going with what worked in the original, and not dive into the ridiculous - like so often is the case in these 3rd or 4rth installments. ",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2011,Jackpollins,6," Yay, it's stupid, but come on, you all know you laughed at least a little
","Little Fockers is the third in a series of films that star Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller & Teri Polo. First, Greg met Jack, his girlfriend Pam's dad, then Jack meant Greg's parents. Now, a random assortment of jokes have been compiled with no real plot or point. That being said, for a movie like this, this is not a bad thing. Little Fockers is like leftover cake, it feels similar and you know it's bad for you, but you just can't help but enjoy it when you're eating it. The movie consists of a set up of jokes that never stop, some funny, some bland, some in between. By far my favorite thing about these movies is Robert De Niro as Jack, Pam's father. De Niro is hilarious and does not care what other people think of him on screen. Of course, seeing both De Niro and Dustin Hoffman as Bernie, Greg's father. Two great actors such as De Niro and Hoffman sharing the screen together is just magical, no matter how stupid the movie is. The whole cast plays well off of each other and it makes for quite a funny movie. Overall, Little Fockers is a fun time at the movies regardless of how stupid it is and I think if you don't mind some stupid with your comedy, then you should definitely check it out.",/review/rw2360466/?ref_=tt_urv
