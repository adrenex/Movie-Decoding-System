",Why is this movie rated so badly? It's actually a really cute and magical little Christmas movie! Definitely has the Christmas spirit which most Christmas movies are lacking these days. Give it a shot!,/review/rw0530329/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2000,RunningFromSatan,7," Extremely underrated
","I have been resenting this movie for the longest time.  But I should have seen it before today...but I shouldn't trash what I haven't seen, right? Because it was a good movie.  I happened to catch it on HBO Plus today...it kind of dragged on a little bit, but other than that...ok, I have to admit it, it was kind of touching.  I think I saw one review trashing the special effects...come on, how low can you go?  I think the people that hate this movie had to have seen a LITTLE bit of something that they liked...it's a family movie that appeals to kids and adults, and that's what I think it did.  I will leave it as that.  A great Christmas movie. 7.5/10",/review/rw0530329/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 1998,slayer-3,7," A snowdad is better than no dad........
","Ok.. This movie seems to be getting a rash of negative reviews. 1).Bad special effects-this movie was NOT made to ""show-off"" special effects. I didn't go for the special effects 2).Lame story- why did you go to the movie in the first place when you knew it was about a deceased dad coming back as a snowman. I didn't go hoping for a realistic plot. 3) Bad acting- Did you actually expect to see an Oscar nominated performance from a talking snowman.",/review/rw0530329/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2013,lisafordeay,8," One of the saddest Christmas movies that was ever made.
","I mean seriously why the 4.9 rating?? I found nothing wrong with this movie. It had a nice story and the cast was great,I always liked Micheal Keaton from his Batman days and I thought he did a terrific job in this movie. The story is about a work-ethic musician named Jack Frost who dies of a car crash one winters night. So his son Charlie plays the harmonic that he gave him and he is magically reincarnated as a snowman. YES A SNOWMAN hilarious right?? So Jack in his new form spends the Christmas with Charlie and they spend some father/son time together.",/review/rw0530329/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2007,funky_cherry86,7," A Wonderful Heartwarming Movie
","Jack Frost, is a great holiday flick to watch around the Christmas season Michael Keaton played the role of the main character pretty well it was amazingly good. This story is about a musician whose trying to make it big in the music business and provide a good life for his wife Gabby (Preston) & their son Charlie (Cross). However he has a tiny problem keeping promises and missing out on important events. Things take an unexpected turn when Jack dies in a car accident before Christmas, one year passes and Charlie still misses him very much. After building a snowman something mysterious happens the snowman comes to life with the spirit of his father in it. Now Jack has the chance to make up for lost time and bond more with his child before disappearing forever. My favorite scene is when Charlie & his mom see Jack's spirit for the last time before saying goodbye that made me cry a bit.",/review/rw0530329/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2008,Pumpkin_Man,7," Awesome Family Fun!!!
","This is a really good family film that takes place around Christmas. To me, it's not really a Christmas movie, but more of a family film that could be watched around Christmas time. (If that makes any sense.) A musician named Jack Frost spends too much time with his music, than with his son and smokin' hot wife. He gives his son, Charlie a harmonica that he says is magic. When Jack has to leave on Christmas Eve, his son gets mad and gives him back the harmonica. Jack changes his mind and decides to go back. While driving, he has a terrible accident and dies. A year later, we see how Charlie and his smokin' hot mom deal with the pain. It's actually quite sad to think about having no dad at Christmas time. Charlie builds a snowman just for the heck of it, and later plays his dad's harmonica. Jack comes back, but in the body of the snowman. Throughout the film, Charlie and Jack have fun and get into misadventures. Until it gets hot, Charlie tries to save his dad from the heat, but Jack knows that he only came back to temporarily for a 2nd chance. If you love comedy, Christmas, and your family, including dad, you'll love JACK FROST!!!",/review/rw0530329/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2000,paul_muscat,10," 'Rocker' Keaton...
","What I thought was essentially a kids' movie turned out to be a much more pleasurable experience. I know, I may be biased a bit towards anything MK-related, however even my best friend (who was with me at the time when we saw it) liked it a lot, even if we saw it closer to Summer rather than Christmas (it came out in Malta, Europe - where I was still living at the time - like some 6 months after it came out in the US!). Anyway, Michael Keaton yet again gives a great performance as a 'snow'man trying quite desperately to make up for lost time. Kelly Preston is good too as his wife and the kid is ok-ish (we've seen much better kid actors, in my opinion). It's only Mark Addy who seems like a fish out of water and looks like he's only in it either because he's a friend of the director or something! He just doesn't seem to gel! All in all, a very cute and neat movie, with good work from Keaton and a rocking good soundtrack, with tracks from the boys Hanson, among others, and Keaton himself raunchily singing a couple of tracks penned by someone from Yes. Great for a night in with the family.",/review/rw0530329/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 1999,Decio,10," Excellent family movie.
","My daughter and I saw this movie today, and I actually say that it could as well be rated G, and that the message has been very good, specially for those whom never stop for a moment to evaluate which is more important in life: family, or work and finances. In real life we know it would be impossible to happen, however the motivation in this picture might wake some people up to reality, and more home dedication. Very well done.",/review/rw0530329/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2006,lordzedd-3,9," Family story of love and snow.
","Where to begin on this Jack Frost, you all know how I feel about the scary horror movie JACK FROST, but this is a magical family movie full of love and laughs. Michael Keaton plays Jack and he does do a great job. Of course some parents may object to the fact that Jack dies in the movie to become the snowman and some smaller children around five or six might have issues with that too. But older kids eight and up will shouldn't have a problem with Jack Frost. The effects are very impressive, it looks like the snowman is really alive and with new next Snowman technology is FROSTY THE SNOWMAN live version that far behind? That's the skinny on Jack Frost the family classic and I give it...9 STARS.",/review/rw0530329/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2009,TheLittleSongbird,5," Starts off very promisingly, but it could have been better
","Now Jack Frost is neither a bad movie or a good movie. It is fine for the family, and it certainly starts off well with a very promising 20 minutes. I also liked the premise of the film, about a musician who dies in a car accident and comes back to life in the form of a snowman to spend time with his neglected son. The soundtrack is great, and the film is nice to look at. The performances are decent from Joseph Cross and Kelly Preston and Michael Keaten while he has been better does well. However, I was not sure what the movie was trying to accomplish. What I mean by that is that it seemed as though it was striving to be a poignant father and son type film and a film full of slapstick comedy. Unfortunately due to the weak script, the film doesn't really succeed at either. The pace is also rather uneven, being slow at times, and the ending is rather schmaltzy. Plus the special effects are in general substandard. All in all, not terrible, but it could have been better. 5/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw0530329/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2000,Lee B,6," I admit it, I cried . . .
","Sorry everyone, but I liked this movie.  I even cried at the end.  My kids freaked when the snowman started to talk and move - one of them got scared by a guy in a teddy bear suit when she was about 3, and she hasn't got over it yet (2 yrs later).  They had loved the start of the movie, with the snowball fight and building the first snowman, but as soon as the second snowman came to life we had to turn the video off.",/review/rw0530329/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2001,janelglin,9," CUTENESS! all the way
","This movie is a really cute movie and a great one to watch around the holidays with your family.  It's not too cute though so that it becomes unlikable.  It was interesting to see Michael Keaton in the Dad role (I've never him as anything besides Batman) and I think he made a really good Dad. I liked the way they dealt with death, it had a very real sense about it. Which is strange, because you have the Dad come back as a SNOWMAN (hah) but once you get over that (it does take a little while, don't give up) it becomes really nice.  I like the ending - I guess I shouldn't give it away, but it was sweet without being corny.  There is a really thin line between cuteness and overkill, but this movie is still on the cute side.  (I gave it 9/10.)",/review/rw0530329/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2012,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,8," Cheesy But Very Cute
","From what I've read, critics think this film does absolutely nothing for them and that it was waste of their time. I'm really surprised that this particular film made no headway in becoming a classic. Although people would say this film is nothing like it, why doesn't anyone see the correlation between this film and John Carpenter's Starman (1984)? The only main difference is really the setting (a snowy environment). A man is lost in a tragic accident and is incarnated once more to give hope to his family members. Is that not the same?",/review/rw0530329/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2021,ivimikey,9," Underappreciated Movie
","I loved this movie as a child and still do today, rewatching it really took me back. The graphics were honestly fine and normal to me especially for a 90s movie. The overall plot and story is great and very heartwarming. This is one of those perfect Christmas family movies, plenty of humor and fun as well as plenty of messages to both kids and parents. To love, cherish one another and the time you have with each other, not to put selfishness above family/loved ones, Put more though into things, never give up/loose hope and many more.",/review/rw0530329/?ref_=tt_urv

3 December 1999,Wayne Eastwood,10," A great family film for Christmas time!
","This film definitely deserves higher marks, I don't know why anyone would give it a 1???  I was going to give it a 9, but decided on a 10 to bring up the percentage- help me out people!  There is something for everyone in this movie, fun snow action for the kids, lessons on being a good friend and sticking up for others, lessons on being a good father, and a great soundtrack including some pretty good blues tunes!  This movie also dealt with the death of a loved one in a very real way- not bad for a comedy/drama. I've always liked Michael Keaton and he doesn't disappoint me here.",/review/rw0530329/?ref_=tt_urv

","Jack Frost is a happily married man, with a son. Until, one stormy night, Jack dies and a year later he is given the chance to come back as a snowman to visit his wife, Gabby and son, Charlie. Jack Frost is a really sad film but a great one, at that. Michael Keaton, Kelly Preston, Joseph Cross and Mark Addy are just some of the brilliant cast included in this great film, which also has some really great music. I give Jack Frost a well deserving 10/10. This film is a must-see for everyone.",/review/rw0530329/?ref_=tt_urv
