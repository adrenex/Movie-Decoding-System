2 May 2022,wingman1111,10," A beautiful journey and wonderful message
",Have now completed the second season and I must say I was truly touched and astounded by the very believable characters (great casting) and quality of writing.,/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2022,tinytots2,7," A well-crafted animated tale that is simultaneously real and mystical
","Both insightful and enjoyable, Undone follows the troubled protagonist Alma as she seeks to confront and resolve family trauma while being perceived as mentally unstable by those around her.",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2019,giagal,10," Hats off to Undone
","A story that couldn't be more touching, intriguing, complicated and fascinating had to be told in a different way of narrating and describing. The whole works seamlessly. There's a touch of P. K. Dick, a hint of Gilliam, a sprinkle of Allen, a nuance of Miyazaki and no trace of Disney. Wonderful... I am at Episode 6 and felt compelled to write this.",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2022,uberdonkey6,8," Great dialogue, interesting story
","Obviously filmed with actors then effects used to make it look animated, which suits the effects and story, but obviously not like a children's animation. Indeed quite artistically beautiful.",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2019,theknownames,10," If your not sure about animation
","Find your sweet spot - At first I wasn't sure where to look, then by the third episode I focused on the eyes and the animation took in a whole new dimension By that time the story line was enough; I was thoroughly immersed .
I recommend",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2019,Pielola,9," Beautifully done
","Well written and beautifully done. Each character is strongly written and the story is compelling. Life, death, and whatever may fall in between. If you're looking for something different, this is it, and more!",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2021,Tweekums,9," Superior animation for adults
","This animated series is centred on Alma Winograd-Diaz, a young woman whose life changes after a car accident... it isn't that she doesn't recover from her injuries; instead she sees her late father who tells her that she has the power to manipulate time. He wants her to discover the truth behind his death; everybody thinks it was suicide or a tragic accident but he believes he was murdered, if they can find the truth Alma might be able to save him. Over the course of the series Alma learns more about her ability and gradually learns more about her father and other family members... her mother is convinced that she is schizophrenic, like her father and grandmother. Is she really able to manipulate time or is she mentally ill?",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2019,MichaelKamalEzzat,9," An aesthetically trippy ethereal cerebral journey through a cynical mind.
","I stumbled upon the trailer for this (experience) a while ago , It got my attention though I thought they are using the rotoscoping technique as a gimmick and boy, I was wrong.",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2022,SheHawGol84,10," A triumph in every way!!
","I have been unknowingly watching rotoscoping animation (All Dogs Go To Heaven, Mary Poppins) since I can remember and even tho I've never seen it I knew about the movie A Scanner Darkly. This show is incredibly visually appealing with the moments that go from ""real life"" suddenly jumping into another realm and the story line just sucks you in with it's concept almost right off the bat. I love the main character too!! She's funny, spunky and not afraid to be herself even tho she is sometimes considered the black sheep of the family. I love this show and I hope to see more of it!!",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2022,ukproject,9," A Beautiful, Thoughtful, Engaging and Trippy Experience
",It's no surprise that Undone uses a pretty similar Rotoscoping technique to 'A Scanner Darkly'. The technique perfectly conveys a trippy experience one might have watching a normal movie after taking some psychedelics.,/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2022,alicianora,10," Poignant and Brillant !
","Season 2 episode 7...I am overwhelmed with emotions. The 2nd season is different from the 1st but I don't mind. I think a common feeling is forgiving oneself and healing generational / familial trauma. This show is beautiful and an important reminder to be grateful for life, because what a gift.",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2022,samet-mecit-sengul,10," Don't miss out on this
","Listen,I could say that this show rocked me to my core,and say that it has a THICC plotline and animations and sound is just incredible. I could say that,but...No need. I am no cry baby no sir but this show caused me to drop too much teardrops that I can handle. So real that hurts. Just watch it,give it a chance if you are a sentimental one. Like this show has curing abilities. Incredible stuff",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2019,tqlrse-956-221500,10," I'm hoping for a 2nd season
","I loved it and can't wait for another season, the story line was great and a little different then some that are out right now and it was just refreshing to watch",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2019,hoboss2806,9," It's weird but beautiful...
","It really reminds me of a mixture between Dark, Shutter Island, the anime Kokkoku, The Science of Sleep, Forget Me Not (with Jim Carry) and some others. And it weirdly works for me.",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2022,alison-carlyle67,9," It's a trip
","Some people see this as an allegory for mental illness. I don't think it is. There are elements of processing loss. It isn't like schizophrenia, it's more like dementia where people get lost in time. We are left guessing as to reality.",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2022,nicholasriley,10," Absolutely beautiful
",This is the most unimaginably beautiful story about healing the past having parallels with real life and the ability we all have but rarely use to bring light into our past and reknow events that have happened in a more conscious way with a deeper understanding of all the surrounding circumstances. Just so inspiring to see a show that has the ability to describe something indescribable. Well done to all involved in this - an absolute triumph and one of the most enlightened productions I have ever seen. Beautiful.,/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2020,calorne,10," Hi makers please read this
","Hello, is that the makers of Undone? I'm here, I'm on my sofa, please can you send season 2. Thank you.",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2022,hj-midnightsun-278-457628,10," Season 2 - EVEN BETTER! Literally couldn't turn off
","I never write reviews, blah blah blah, but oh my goodness, what a ride! I loved the first season and feel like I've been waiting eagerly for s02 for eons. Put it on last night and couldn't help but scoff the lot.",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2019,allahamada,9," A stellar marriage of style and substance !
","Amazon's latest original title ''Undone'' manages, and magnificently so , to intricately integrate flabbergasting ''Rotoscope'' animation with surreal, thought-provoking storytelling.",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2022,Thatdudelou,10," Undone is Beyond.
","To say that this series is ""woke"" is merely fodder of ignorance. Art is not to be spoon fed it is to be experienced. There is no one way to see stories both written or animated. As much as we want our lives to be a straight line, Space and time is non-linear. Imagination is non-linear. I love this show in all its forms.",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2022,chriscox-36259,8," Fun. We need to make this point.
","Yes this show is touching, fascinating, bold, different. But these sorts of descriptions put me off watching it, because I am a very shallow person and generally avoid things described as 'profound', 'thought-provoking', 'moving' etc. What I realise having watched the first season and just starting the second, is that it is fun. Fun fun fun! Funny, fast-moving, addictive fun. This really should be said more, because it might help the show reach emotionally immature people like myself.",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2019,fciocca,7," A trip inside mental illness and processing of a personal loss, with a unique style.
","Rotoscoping is one of the best form of art, and unfortunately, because its complexity to realize from a technical perspective, there are not many movies or shows that adopt it. Also because it is not a style that you can always use: you need the right story, and Undone matches perfectly with this kind of animation. The show is visually impressive and creators put a lot of effort to create amazing, dynamic and original transitions. I think that are the strongest point, from a composition perspective.",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2021,elizrug,10," So well done and authentic
","I love this type of animation, I love the actors, the story is intriguing. I flipped it on while bored and watched the whole series in 2 days. Rosa Salazar is, well, wow.",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2019,spelunkyfrog,9," Broken People
","If you've ever suffered mental illness, felt alone, let others down, felt uncomfortable, made others feel uncomfortable, or questioned your reality, this is for you.",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2019,Dello_,7," From the peak to the collapse
","Undone is a very particular show that I loved for the first four episodes (which is the first half of them). But then I found some huge problems between the plot and world built at that point. In the last part it's like if all the rules established were ignored because ""the show is cryptic and metaphysical so everything is possible"" and this thought is used to serve the plot to be as free as possible. And that's were the show broke down for me. So there's a love/hate relationship.
In all of that Undone manages to touch very high highs, with some very poetic moments. I also appreciated the drawings and the general sense of ambiguity.
In the grand scheme of things I liked Undone but it was also frustrating because it could be so much more, and the first half surely lived up to his potential.",/review/rw5276414/?ref_=tt_urv
