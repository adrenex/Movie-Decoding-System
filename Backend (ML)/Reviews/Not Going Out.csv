2 November 2019,theenigma129,10," This was ok.
","I have a confession to make and please don't get me wrong when I say this. The only reason I watch this show is the same reason why I watch victorious in the first place: ariana grande and no one else. I still love cat, she's my most favorites (besides the other characters ariana did after Sam & cat) even though in the later seasons of her first show and coming onto this spinoff show, looks as if cat got way too high and scrambled from all the anti-bipolar meds she's been taken. But still love cat. I was very upset and mad that the show got cancelled on when cat has gone to jail for a week. Still happy that ariana loves & misses being on nickelodeon and I wish she can come back someday soon.",/review/rw2870780/?ref_=tt_urv

","It isn't as good as some other TV shows and if I'm honest, not every episode is great. Most are though. It is rather comical but when you look at the other two TV shows that kind of brings this one together, victorious and icarly, this one isn't as good. It is still funny and for everyone, even though it is aimed at younger audiences. It is definitely worth giving it a chance.",/review/rw2870780/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2013,NewOCFan,10," After watching the pilot
","Sam & Cat has gotten off to a good start. There were a couple of sweet moments and both came from Sam and Cat each. Sam is less of that girl that's getting into trouble with the law and a little more in trouble with the kids she and Cat will have to babysit. Towards the end of iCarly, after she and Freddie broke up and was suggested by him to be a little more normal, she's shown to take his advice and there are a few moments where it shows she's getting better as a person but without going 180 to the point where you don't know who this chick is that says she's Sam Puckett. I'm not sure how much Cat's going to develop as a character but considering this WAS originally going to be Jennette McCurdy's show (who is rising to fame gradually due to so much of the work she's done), I feel this show can definitely be watched for Sam. Granted, she's not the best with kids either. iCarly was proof of that in one episode (before the Seddie arc). What happens throughout the show I see will be due to how Sam and Cat are with their personalities or because the kids themselves are out of control. Considering Cat's Nona wanted to move to an elderly home after her last babysitting job, you can really see why babysitting these kids would be crazy, even for Sam & Cat. Towards the very end of the first episode do they actually babysit the kids that were visiting after saving a man's life. And even as a fan, I do admit how they saved him is pretty odd but then again, maybe they were still performing ""C-3P0"" as Cat said they should and weren't doing CPR like they thought. But the thing is, to not take what happens on the show so seriously. If Sam & Cat were amazing babysitters already, the show wouldn't be the same. It'd be boring actually, not even close to a comedy then. At this point, I have yet to see how good the character Dice is and Nona seems like a sweetheart and I'm glad she's apart of the show. The good part about the show is Sam and Cat, having already been loved in their respective shows and being wished by fans to have their own show, get to shine more as characters, as well as the actors. Unfortunately I've never seen Ariana Grande play another character. Interesting fact is she was on Broadway before television. Jennette McCurdy has had praise for her acting since she was really little, BEFORE iCarly so to see a show of hers (that was originally just hers) where she gets to be the star is a real treat to me. There's going to be a lot of crazy stories/episodes. And I mean crazy for sure. It's definitely far better than most of what's on Nickelodeon now, to me. Really, you'd have to see the first few episodes of the show yourself. With Dan Schneider's shows you see development in characters over time, and it may even be not so noticeable especially if you're really biased towards a show or the character. Kids and Ariana fans may really enjoy Cat, and Sam maybe watched by anyone who may not be fond of Cat's voice. There's nothing really to complain about with this show. It's not like some show I'm thinking of. It had a good beginning, building up the sweet friendship between Sam and Cat already (this is why I'm watching aside from the humour). Sam and Cat and their friendship are why I'll love this show.",/review/rw2870780/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2020,danieln-15525,," Brilliant and underrated
","Where to start? That's one of the best Dan Schneider's shows on Nick. Not many truly understand how brilliant this show is. Brilliant script and funny & creative writing. A homeless, Herb, who claims he is rich. A restaurant where the waiters are robots, Talented child-actors in almost every episode. And the unbelievable ending. BEST ending for children television. You CANNOT realize how absolutely brilliant this show is. Just watch it. :)",/review/rw2870780/?ref_=tt_urv

","I just saw the premiere of ""Sam and Cat"" last night, and when I saw the trailers and previews for it before it came out, I was afraid it was going to be as horrible as the disgrace to comedy that is ""Victorious."" I was really wrong. From what I saw in the pilot episode, ""Sam and Cat"" didn't disappoint me at all. This show is very funny with the most adorable moments. Jennette McCurdy shines again as Sam Puckett, Carly Shay's best friend, only this time, she meets Cat Valentine and they become roommates, while starting a babysitting service in Cat's grandmother's home in L.A.",/review/rw2870780/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2014,maxwelltron25,9," Great, but not perfect.
","Sam and Cat is an amazing show. Why? First of all, what is it about? Sam from iCarly and Cat from Victorious meeting each other, becoming roommates and starting a babysitting service. And why is this funny? Their personalities are so different, that they always bounce around and get tied in a knot of humor. The plot never gets old (okay, maybe SOMETIMES), and the kids they babysit are hilarious. But there are some bad things. Sometimes, the kids they babysit can be very annoying and naughty. Secondly, Cat's voice sometimes makes me want to never hear anything again. Yet that barely happens. Go on, watch, enjoy, and bring on season 2, Nick! Please note that this is just an opinion, so it's okay if you like it or not. I give it a 9/10.",/review/rw2870780/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2013,hblovesclemson,4," A weak Nickelodeon show through and through
","There are a few reasons why this double-spin off is a total miss: First of all, both Sam (from iCarly) and Cat (from Victorious) were foil characters on their respective shows, with the funny weird stuff to offset the more well-defined, balanced characters. Here we have two comic relief characters and no one to offset them. Look at 'Friends': The ill-advised spin off, 'Joey', was an absolute train wreck, because Joey as a character was not strong enough to occupy an entire show. Sam and Cat are just not strong enough as separates or together in this same way. Both Victorious and iCarly also had strong premises, whereas the premise of Sam & Cat is extremely weak. They're living together and they've started a baby-sitting service. That's pretty much it. There are a few throw-in characters, like a little black market-dealing kid, but none of them add anything to the already weak concept. Nickelodeon was grasping at straws trying to come up with a reason why these two girls would live together and what they would do. My biggest complaint, however, is that when you take Sam away from the iCarly cast and Cat from the Victorious cast, their characters are basically just annoying. Putting them together doesn't help anything. Sam is just a really bad person all the way around, and Cat is borderline mentally retarded. To sum it up, going from iCarly and Victorious, this is a huge step down from both. Not nearly as funny, or interesting, or relatable in any way shape or form.",/review/rw2870780/?ref_=tt_urv

23 August 2014,rjc7394,7," OMG, Ariana Grande is hilarious!
","I have not seen someone this funny (especially a young adult) in a very long time. I tuned in less than a month ago to see what Jennette McCurdy was up to and Ariana Grande's character totally shocked me. I had no idea what she was doing. At first I thought she was mentally-challenged then I read her say that she was playing dumb. She would stare into space and hesitate and wave her arms in the air and talk with an inflection that reminded me so much of Emo Phillips, the comedian (I could never understand him and I could not tolerate his inflection) or even Pee-Wee Herman to an extent. Ariana is so unique for her age and she's quick and an extremely good actor and comic. She is going to be huge at whatever she puts her mind to. (She is a better actor than any of the ""Friends"" actors were during their first two seasons.) I would give this series a ""10"" but I think the writing and themes can be poor. Producer Dan Schneider has a pretty warped sense of humor. Some of the stories and lines give bad examples to kids, imo: Sam and Cat are very materialistic, Sam's character basically hates people (eg. that part shocked me), and some of the other older characters seem very shallow. Plus, these characters do not need to be making butt jokes. (It's totally inappropriate for young kids.) But some of the stories, lines and sight gags are extremely funny! The acting and laughs sold me after the 3rd episode that I watched. This series had ""success"" written all over it due to Jennette and Ariana. (I would have replaced the writers if the series went on to a second season. I'm an adult male and I'll watch some of these adolescent shows for a change of pace just to see what they're up to. Lord knows Hollywood has been striking out with adult TV sitcoms and reality shows.) I can't believe that they couldn't bring Jennette and Ariana back together for more Sam and Cat!",/review/rw2870780/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2020,acedj,1," From the point of view of an adult
","This is rubbish. I have a kid that is 26 and one that is 7, so I have run the gambit of television directed at children. One thing I have noticed is that they are getting dumber and dumber. I love the music that Arianna Grande puts out, but the stupid affectation she adopted for her role as Cat makes me want to rip my eardrums out. I understand why the older kids (teens) like this; there are a couple of very pretty young ladies on it, but I do not understand the interest of the younger kids, because beyond Arianna's voice there is nothing even remotely funny here, not that I was saying her voice is funny. There are shows directed at kids that I can watch and not wish for myself to have a stroke, there are some that are enjoyable, this is NOT one. Nickelodeon used to have some funny shows on it, but those days are long past. Nick, get some new writers...",/review/rw2870780/?ref_=tt_urv

11 August 2013,SanteeFats,8," Pretty funny
","When I watched the first couple of episodes I was uncertain if I would keep on watching. I decided to keep watching and have seen the show improve as the actors, writers, director, and the producer all get in sync with each other. Yes this show is sophomoric overall but it is funny and the plots are getting a bit better. I am not to sure about the addition of Goomer, is anyone that stupid but can still live alone? In the last episode I saw it was nice to see that Goomer's mom is a black woman who adopted him, not as her first choice as it turns out. Usually what I have seen is the nice white folks that adopt a different ethnicity and raise them to be a super citizen. So far I am liking the series although I still wish Cat would act a little less ignorant and stupid.",/review/rw2870780/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2013,nowplaying108,4," somewhat funny but not very original
","Sam & Cat is a bit of a disappointment. It looks like every other show running on Nick right now and that's not very good. The Cat character isn't as funny as she was on Victorious and Jenny is just as dour. Together the two don't make for great comedy. The humor seems skewed for 5-8 year olds who have never read a book in their lives and don't want to. There are no original characters and no original jokes. Which doesn't mean it won't do well. It just doesn't have anything of value. The best thing that could happen to this show is lots of visits from the other cast members of iCarly and Victorious. Maybe that would spark the brains of the writers back into writing comedy. This looks like something slapped together to look like every other show on Nick. Ooops, I guess I'm repeating myself but the show looks like a repeat so it's only fitting. Seriously, how could Cat be so funny on Victorious and so boring on this show? Maybe it has to do with the fact that on Victorious the other characters were intelligent and so her ""dumb,"" ""literal"" humor worked. Here it just fits in with everyone else and isn't funny at all.",/review/rw2870780/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2014,Shopaholic35,5," Pretty weak with nothing new.
","Another low-brow, immature offering from the creators at Nickelodeon. The show generates a few laughs but continues to rely on slapstick comedy a little too much. I get it, it is a show for younger children but why must it be so brainless.",/review/rw2870780/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2013,Pintadgl26,8," Needs more adventure
","I love iCarly and Victorious. When I heard that both shows were getting a spin-off called Sam and Cat, I didn't mind at all. The series finally aired on June 8, 2013. I have seen all episodes that have aired and I must say.... I didn't think it was the best. I'm not saying the show is bad. I'm proud that Dan Schneider is not giving up on Ariana Grande and Jennette McCurdy, but I think that the show can do better. It's just not exciting. It needs more.....ADVENTURE! It would be cool if they made an episode where Sam and Cat went sailing on an ocean and they were attacked by some kind of sea monster. The show didn't have to be about Sam and Cat being babysitters. They could go on much better adventures than that. I still like the show though. I admit, it's pretty funny and it seems impossible for it to have a non-laughing audience. I just think that Dan Schneider is capable of making it more interesting.",/review/rw2870780/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2014,pentiumjs,1," iCarly II: The Sitcom That Would Not Die
","So it turns out there's a sizable base of fans who couldn't bear to see iCarly or Victorious go away; hence the televised train wreck that is Sam & Cat. This show reeks of laziness--just one cookie-cutter plot or joke after another, mostly ripped from Dan Schneider's earlier shows. Kids may cackle at getting his ""in-jokes,"" but adults will wonder who's even meant to be impressed by turning Silence of the Lambs into a slapstick. Childlike physical humor is crossed with bosom jokes and 50-year-old pop culture references, leaving a mangled mess that's ideal for nobody. Spencer is replaced with Goomer, a deranged man-child whose acting varies from creepy to imbecilic. Freddie is now Dice, a graduate of the Josh Peck School of Acting who shouts every line at maximum volume with no regard for what tone was intended. The only jokes delivered to this verbal punching bag are about his hair, yet somehow he's filler for half of each episode. The remainder is covered by Sam and Cat, each eerily old with the latter shrilling like a Bee Gee on every line and the former delivering her one-note sarcasm ad nauseum. The laugh track roars profusely enough to wake somebody from a coma, and somehow the psychopaths the titular characters babysit are even more irksome than the stars themselves. This show began with one of its actors falling into a garbage truck; frankly, it should've stayed there.",/review/rw2870780/?ref_=tt_urv

","I really REALLY hate Nick sitcoms, because they have a bunch of dumb jokes and uninteresting plot lines and characters. That's when I was introduced to Sam & Cat. Now, for those who don't know this is a spin-off in the Schneiderverse. Dan Schneider made some of Nick's popular shows like iCarly, Victorious, Henry Danger, Zoey 101, The Amanda Show and more that I can't remember at the top of my head. Which six year old me had NO IDEA in the first place that it was a spin-off. It was just one of those shows that would play in the background but something about it caught my attention so six year old me decided to give it a shot.

","This show is what you get when a senile kid show creator runs out of fresh ideas and borrows from past shows he's done. It's completely dull and unfunny. The jokes are what you'd expect from Schneider, rehashed and recycled fart and puberty jokes. The characters are retarded and make poor choices on purpose, the opposite role models of what kids should be seeing. The main characters are also constantly doing things to try to screw each other over. But the by far worst part about this show is Cat's voice. I really can't stand it, and half way through the show I want to bite the cyanide pill and end the pain. The high-pitched monotone voice Ariana Grande is making is really irritating, and will make you want to blast your TV with a shotgun.

","This show is equivalent to the Big Bang Theory of children's television.Dan Schneider has created a new show that is absolutely amazing. Ariana Grande and Jenette McCurdy are amazing actors, they play characters far from their real selves and succeed in relating and becoming their character. Both characters bring out a side of television that has never been brought out before .

","With no substantial plot, taking the worst character from Victorious, degrading the character of Sam Puckett. And introducing a freakish MMA fighter who is a pure example of regressive behaviour. All Schneider can do is go form OK (iCarly) to pretty good (Victorious) to terrible (this show). What next? A spin off where children turn into fathers and mothers and adults into pre-school children? Sam and Cat brings out the worse of any creativity. It should be cancelled immediately and have just Sam or a new character for Jennette McCurdy.
