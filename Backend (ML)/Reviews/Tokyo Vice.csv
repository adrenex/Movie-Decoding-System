15 April 2022,A_Different_Drummer,9," stranger in a strange land... on steroids
","Irony -- other shows work so hard to create a vibe of tension and potential threat. Here, if you can relate to this wonderfully relatable character, every second of every moment is filled with tension because the Japanese culture is one of the most unique on the planet. And one of the most especially unforgiving towards outsiders. (I have seen thousands of films, submitted almost 2000 reviews here, and yet the most terrifying movie I have ever seen is Japan's 1964 ""Woman in the Dunes,"" which is not even a horror movie!) Excellent and addictive series. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

30 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Really Good!
","I'm blown away by how much I enjoyed Tokyo Vice. It was created by Michael Mann (Heat, Ali, Collateral, Miami Vice, etc) and you can definitely tell because it has Mann's gritty style. It's based off a true story and shows a realistic view of Japans criminal world. It follows American journalist Jake Adelstein (Ansel Elgort) as he works with the police to descend in the criminal underworld of Tokyo.! The entire cast is great and led by especially great performances by Ansel Elgort and Ken Watanabe, among others. If you're looking for a good thriller then give this a try. I promise you won't be disappointed!",/review/rw8099501/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Excellent!
",Tokyo Vice was so much better than I expected. It looked good to me and I'm a Michael Mann fan and heard he was attached and it still exceeded my expectations. It's based off a true story and shows a realistic view of Japans criminal world. This show is exciting and will keep you on the edge of your seat from the very first episode throughout the series! The entire cast is great and led by especially great performances by Ansel Elgort and Ken Watanabe. I absolutely recommend this show!,/review/rw8099501/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2022,nbutcher-69458,9," I worked in a Japanese company in Japan
","I've walked part-way in Jake Adelstein's shoes. I used to work in a Japanese IT company in Tokyo as the only Japanese speaking caucasian employee. I took hour long trips through the crowded train stations, learning to sleep while standing up, jammed between other commuters. Finally returning home after a late night karate lesson to what can only be described as a hole in the wall. Only to get up again with little sleep and do it all over again.",/review/rw8099501/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2022,brett-76260,9," Love it
","Finally something new to get behind! I have to say I really love this series. I lived in Japan while on active duty with the Marine Corps and I fell in love with Japan, the culture, the beautiful people, the history and everything else about it. If there is any other country I could live in again, it would be Japan. The culture was so impactful on me as a young Marine, it just has never left me... Anyway This show is extremely well made and gives you a little dose of everything Japan. Great acting, great writing, solid directing it really has it all. Don't screw this up HBO and not give us another season. If you are into crime type dramas, give this a go. And Give it 3 episodes before you make any decisions. You're hooked after that. Tokyo is one of the most unbelievable cities in the world that's for sure so go visit! The city, and the people, will change your life forever! Again give the show a try. You will really enjoy it.",/review/rw8099501/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2022,bosporan,8," Enjoyable viewing, worth climbing the barrier to entry
","Enjoyed the first three episodes, invested in the main characters and keen to discover what happens next. Daunting at first with the skew toward Japanese with subtitles, though the balance has changed and this has eased significantly. Some great direction producing fine imagery through use of cinematography, wardrobe and linguistics. It is clear the story is a whodunnit exploring the contrast between conformity & self and honour & honesty.",/review/rw8099501/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2022,paul-allaer,8," Riveting look into Tokyo's (sub)culture and crime world
","As Episode 1 of ""Tokyo World"" (2022 release; 8 episodes of about an hour each) opens, we are following two reporters, one of which is Jake Adelstein. They arrive at a restaurant, only to find out that their hosts, members of the Yakoza, have moved the meeting to a private room. We then go to ""1999, Two Years Earlier"", as Adelstein is prepping to take a qualifying exam at a major Japanese newspaper, having moved there from Missouri three years earlier. At this point we are 10 min into Episode 1.",/review/rw8099501/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2022,Tweekums,9," The gripping story of an American reporter on a Japanese newspaper who worked to expose the Yakuza
","This series is centred on Jake Adelstein, an American who became the first foreigner to work at top Tokyo newspaper. He soon learns that the way they do things isn't how he imagined. He also sees that many stories connect to the Yakuza, the Mafia-like crime families that seem to have a finger in every pie in the country. Proving the involvement of anybody apart from low level members is almost impossible and the police don't seem to mind so long as they have an arrest. Intertwined with Jake's story are looks into the lives of Samantha, an American woman working at a hostess bar and Sato, an up-and-coming member of the Yakuza.",/review/rw8099501/?ref_=tt_urv

29 April 2022,mwen001-2,8," Delivered
","It took a while for this show to be made but the result is pretty cool! Michael Mann knows how to do interesting thriller and delivers again. Great atmosphere, great camera work and a great cast! Good stuff and shows that HBO is still the gold standard...not Netflix!;)",/review/rw8099501/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2022,tkdlifemagazine,9," This is Terrific Noir Television
","I can even express how much I enjoyed this 1990's period dramatic thriller based upon a book by the main character I have not read. The writing, the cinematography, and acting are movie quality. This is the story of a young American journalist working and thriving in Japan. He becomes involved in the world of the Japanese underworld and the police as he tries to find his was socially and professionally. Ansel Elgort (Jake), Rachel Keller (Samantha), Ken Watanabe (Katagiri) and Rinko Kikuchi (Eimi) are terrific in this. While this stars Ansel Elgort it is a triumph for Ken Watanabe who is excellent, and also produced this. HBO has treated this one with the seriousness it deserves but it is also endearing and that is based on the depth of the characters. Japan is an additional character in this and she is fascinating. I recommend this highly.",/review/rw8099501/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2022,lee_eisenberg,10," Japan is not what you think
","Most of the news about Japan in the mid- to late-'90s involved the country's economic problems. But that wasn't all that was happening in the Land of the Rising Sun. Jake Adelstein spent time in Tokyo as a reporter in the late '90s and wrote a book about his experiences. ""Tokyo Vice"", based on the book, shows Adelstein in Japan's capital, a world where nothing is what it seems.",/review/rw8099501/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2022,therealhman,8," Excellent show. Good story, very good acting.
","Rachel Keller really nails her character. You are drawn in by her character. Ansel Elgort, who I've never seen before, plays Jake very well. The Japanese actors also make their roles believable. When you are watching you feel like ""you are there.""",/review/rw8099501/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2022,yooniverse,10," Wow, way better than expected
","When I saw Michael Mann's name associated with this, I pictured a ""Miami Vice"" set in Tokyo. It's also based on a true story, so I didn't have high hopes, as most true-story adaptations tend to be flat. And there's is that tired old theme of a westerner in the Far East, and the history of mediocre U. S.-Japan-cast collaborative films and TV shows. I was wrong!",/review/rw8099501/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2022,visionandyouth,8," Beautiful 90's Japan.

7 April 2022,talkteav,9," Tokyo Vice Is Dark, Gritty Filled With Death Stares And Intrigue
","Tokyo Vice is a dark, gritty drama that builds intrigue from the very beginning. The criminals have deep traditions like the Sopranos. The police and the crimes committed are violent and shocking, similar to The Wire, and the cinematography is dark, like Boardwalk Empire. It's everything you want in a classic HBO Mobster/Gangster story with a very talented ensemble.",/review/rw8099501/?ref_=tt_urv

25 April 2022,jimmycoffin-751-212853,8," Best show On HBO
","It's been Along while since a Tvshow hooked me. There's an abundant , IF not Infinite throwback shows and movies that tries to capture the early 80s, 90s sprinkled neon nostalgia. So much so It almost becomes comically overdone. The 80s revival In countless Indie cyberpunk games to music where pop icons like miley curys, dua lipa and weeknd spoonfeed us 80s and 90s inspired hits on daily basis, where synthwave and synthwave movie scores has been going strong for 5 years. And tokyo revival In cinema Is almost nonstop. From Kate to bladerunner anime. But none of them has really captured the true gritty somber vibe. From stranger things, american horror story, glow and back again. Tokyo Vice doesn't care about the glossy Neon cgi crap and makes a calculated, clever and beatifully minimalistic thriller. Tokyo Vice Is my kind of jam. The Photoshop Is more toned to chungking express and old 90s japanese movies then the modern trends. Actors, music and the story Is thrilling and I was glued watching Tokyo Vice.",/review/rw8099501/?ref_=tt_urv

29 April 2022,hkstephen,7," I was expecting two more episodes ( Ep 9 & 10 ) before this season ends...
","Yes, it's based on the memoir of the reporter Jake Adelstein with his reporting life in Japan, but then you can't always copy everything into drama series, not because it's not going to be authentic, but it still needs to bring certain entertainments and interesting contents for general audiences to get into the show, which it is successfully bringing that aspect.",/review/rw8099501/?ref_=tt_urv
