17 July 2016,3xHCCH,8," Just Watched It and Liked It, Surprised with All the Hate
","The first ""Ghostbusters"" was a classic American comedy film from 1984. Written by actors Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and directed by Ivan Reitman, it was about three parapsychologists (Venkman, Stantz and Spengler) who ran a ghost hunting outfit in New York City. This year, a reboot of this film with an all-female main cast written and directed by Paul Feig is released. ",/review/rw3692863/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2017,ivan2012,7," Underrated
","It deserves better than a 5.3, which is the average user rating on the day I am writing this. Maybe fans of the original Ghostbusters films are trashing this because they don't think it measures up to the original. I have a different view. I think this female version is actually a little better. This one has more funny moments IMO and the four ladies are all likable. Wiig and McCarthy have most of the funny moments as you would expect. Kate McKinnon's character was over-the-top and a bit annoying at first but she grows on you. Leslie Jones did a fine job as well, but she's about a foot taller than McCarthy and McKinnon so it looks a little awkward when they're standing next to each other. Jones' motivation for joining as the 4th member also wasn't explained very well in the film.",/review/rw3692863/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am a 38 year old male who grew up on the first 2 Ghostbusters, and the original REAL GHOSTBUSTERS animated series. Always loved the first movie and the cartoon, merely found the 2nd movie to be ""okay"", though as an adult i find it is better then i thought it was as a kid.",/review/rw3692863/?ref_=tt_urv

",There was no need to make this. It was diabolical in many ways and after just viewing the trailer for Afterlife this pops back up with a 6.6 star rating. How?! Ghostbusters 2 has a 6.6 rating. You're telling me that people think this crap is equally good?! No! The only good thing about this disaster was one particular scene in 3D. Hopefully Afterlife will be far better.,/review/rw3692863/?ref_=tt_urv

6 December 2016,fraser-simons,7," Making the Ghostbusters relevant again
","I really enjoyed this movie. They intentionally subvert some of the tropes from the original, which, frankly is not that funny. Especially when you remember how sexist they are towards their own secretary -- oh wait, it's always like they flipped that on it's head. And guess what, it works and I found it very funny.

12 February 2017,BA_Harrison,2," Spooktacularly bad.
","Three scientists (Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, and Kate McKinnon) and a subway worker (Leslie Jones) form Ghostbusters, a team dedicated to ridding the world of unwanted spooks. The foursome have their work cut out for them when weirdo janitor Rowan North (Neil Casey) puts into motion his plan to unleash malevolent spirits on New York.",/review/rw3692863/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2016,monstermayhem32,7," The new ghostbusters
","While it has been 27 years since ghostbusters 2 which I know didn't leave a great impression with many fans myself included but I will admit that I enjoyed this reboot a lot. While many were probably hoping for an continuation for what should have been a third film but j think this is just fine even though fans had their doubts about the ghostbusters being played by the ladies. While it does have many elements that made the original film a. Classic such as the theme song, the echo one car, and plenty of ghosts including slimer and stay puff marshmallow. The film also has cameo appearances from original cast members Bill Murray, Dan akyroyd, sigourney weaver, Annie Potts, and Ernie Hudson.",/review/rw3692863/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2016,utgard14,3," No matter how much some may not want it to, this remake really does suck
","What's to say? At this point the movie is so mired in controversy that any opinion on it seems like a political statement more than a movie review. But here we go anyway - I didn't like it. It feels less like a movie with an idea (in this case a recycled one) and more like one of the many subpar comedies we have today where a few comedians who are friends in real life get together and give us two hours of smug back-patting. It offers nothing memorable of its own, just a few reworked things from the original movie, which was a classic with many iconic images and scenes. The only thing anyone will remember about this is the controversy surrounding it. I don't care much for Melissa McCarthy or Leslie Jones but I do like Kristen Wiig and I'm trying very hard to like Kate McKinnon (perhaps too hard). None of these women are impressive here. Chris Hemsworth's character is used too much. It's an obvious joke that doesn't get funnier the more you tell it. Ultimately the problem with this movie isn't that ""women aren't funny,"" so much as comedy writers today are very lazy and uninspired.",/review/rw3692863/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2016,austin0731,6," does it live up to the hate???
","So, the Ghostbusters reboot that has been hated on since before it even got a chance. The hate for this film was very evident since back when we first got to see the trailers for this film, which was of course not very good. But how is the actual film? The thing to make clear of is that there is nearly no way that this could ever surpass the originals but there is also no way that it deserves the amount of hate that it has deserved.",/review/rw3692863/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2018,Leofwine_draca,3," Should never have been made
","I admit from the start that I'm a massive fan of the original GHOST BUSTERS, although the sequel isn't so hot. Both films look like absolute classics compared to this ill-advised reboot of the series, recasting with an all-female ghostbusting team. Although the film looks similar to the original movies, it feels absolutely NOTHING like them. Gone is the character interplay and genuinely funny and droll performances that could be enjoyed by kids and adults alike; it's replaced by the kind of modern-day sarcasm and idiocy that I always end up hating. The new cast members are all unlikeable, and the likes of Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy seem to be competing as to who can be the most irritating of the lot. Yes, the new-fangled CGI effects are very colourful and pretty, but they don't have any of the character and finesse of the old effects, which you knew were hard to do thus all the more impressive. The plot is as predictable as they come, and the only person who raised the occasional smile was Chris Hemsworth. I'm afraid the new GHOSTBUSTERS should never have been made.",/review/rw3692863/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2016,abisio,10," Lots more of fun than the original

15 August 2016,jacquesdr,7," True to Ghostbusters 1984
","With all the movie doomsday prophets/critics that we have on open media these days, it becomes very easy for personal taste and offence people take to ""an old favourite"" being ""rebooted"". For some perspective: Ghostbusters was the first film I ever saw in a cinema back in 1984. I have rerun my own copy of this film (along with Supergirl which I saw in the same cinema the same season) probably more than 30 times. It sparked my interest in cinema and the performing arts of which I would eventually become a custodian. Let's immediately cut past all the fluff of reviews which tends to be full of either unsubstantiated criticism, personal preference references or elation based on their own framework. Yes, there is a lot of CGI â€“ but then again so was there a lot of CGI in Avatar. Yes, the cast and characters have been completely turned on their heads (there is more than ample reference and nods to the original) and yes, it follows a very stylized and structured formula (well, that is why it is a franchise). If you do not like any of these concepts, you would probably be better suited not to watch a sequel of any kind and it would be advised to stay away from anything that follows suite of an original idea. And please avoid Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Horror and most other genre's outside of art-house, drama and thriller. I have never been a big fan of remakes or reboot attempts of big successful classics. With the exception of Star Trek, Superman and a few others, it has seldom proved to work. My main criticism of Ghostbusters 2016 will also be that this film should have been Ghostbusters 3 and the story was perfectly believable to be adapted into a follow up of the original. Why it had to be produced under the banner of a reboot makes absolutely no sense from either a brand point of view and neither does the premise of the new cast and their journey deem it necessary. Getting to the actual movie, it would always be close too impossible to recreate the original first installment. So what do we expect from a sequel then? Definitely a little of the same, yet something a little different. So we definitely want ""something new"" but to remain true to the soul of the original. Without a doubt Ghostbusters 2016 delivers on this. Though there was ample CGI giving a really new modern feel to the film, it has absolutely no lack of gadgets and science paraphernalia that was VERY TRUE to the original in looks, style and function. The humour of Ghostbusters must be one of the elements that has always set it apart from other productions in its category. Again here the film does not let you down. There is Easter-Eggs galore and Ghostbusters 2016 definitely has the same fine, sharp and undertone humour of its original 1984 installment. I was never a fan of Ghostbusters 2 and Ghostbusters 2016 definitely delivered, for me, a better sequel to the original that the second installment ever did. The acting style is 100% spot on, the directing is fast paced with slower moments to allow the viewer to breath in just the right places. All in all, through impeccable timing, respectfully honoring the original, loads of breath-taking creative CGI and themes that have clearly made some critics uncomfortable, Ghostbusters 2016 definitely hits most of it's marks.",/review/rw3692863/?ref_=tt_urv

","Well, it's finally come. The remake that would ruin all childhoods, emasculate everyone, and bring about the complete and total breakdown of society as we know it. I've seen rants, raves, fits, and complaints leading up to the release, but was pleased to see that the critical reviews were pretty good.

","There's something strange ... in the world... and it's Ghostbusters. I'm surprised on how many mouth foaming fans of the original there are that a female remake would gather so much hatred. On that note, I grew up watching Ghostbusters and thought Ghostbusters 2 was one of the worst sequels out there.

","This is one of the worst things that has happened to the movie industry, and definitely doesn't live up to the original. Nuff said. I will admit, though, there's nice action scenes and proton weapons that the OG gang would have looked fantastic using. And speaking of the OG gang, they all cameo in the movie in the best ways possible, which I really liked. And one scene with Chris Hemsworth's character is hilarious, but apart from the cameos from the OGs, it's the only funny scene in the movie.",/review/rw3692863/?ref_=tt_urv

16 July 2016,subxerogravity,6," I answered the call, and it was worth it! Really, It was it was fun and funny!
","I do understand some geeks on this. I've been waiting for Ghostbusters 3 forever. Bill Murray is still funny and still relevant enough to lead the return of Venkman, Stantz, and Zeddemore, but tragedy hit, with the death of Spengler (Harold Ramis) in 2014. Part 3 would never be the same without all Four horsemen.",/review/rw3692863/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2017,elizy-33092,4," Holloywood needs to quit remaking classics and start something fresh
","When I heard that they were remaking the movie Ghostbusters with female cast members, I admit that I was actually looking forward to it, specially considering the four particular actresses they had chosen for the part. I understood that movie remakes are typically the greatest, but considering the fact that 3 out of the four cast members are currently or were once members of SNL, I had some hope. Unfortunately, Wigg's comedic talent wasn't able to shine with her boring character with a lack of personality, McKinnon's character was just upright stupid and unrealistic, Jones's character was just a black stereotype, and McCarthy's role lacked character as well. Many of the jokes just fell flat (Steve Higgins small role and joke with the middle finger, the won tons, Kevin's (aka. Chris Hemsworth's) logo scene, the thing with the hair dye at the end, and so on). Also, the had many references to the original ghost busters throughout the film, and yet I suppose the setting takes place in a universe where the original squad had never existed, it's like a slap to the face to the original cast. Sure they had Bill Murry and few other actors for the older version show up in a few small parts, but they play such tiny roles, and as different characters..",/review/rw3692863/?ref_=tt_urv
