","Passions is pure entertainment. Complete with witches, orangutans, secrets, forbidden loves, great couples (even if they spend way more time apart than they do together), and comedy!  There's a lot of funny moments that you just can't help but to laugh out loud over.  The cast is superb!",/review/rw0642230/?ref_=tt_urv

5 August 2020,Dabby_Johnson,10," Show Slaps!
","Fall of 2000 I was at my dirtbag homeboy Skippy's house. He was out scoring us some narcotics & I was geeked out of my mind, seriously struggling with sleep deprivation & cocaine psychosis & needless to say was just in general tripping. I hadn't watched any soaps since Days of Our Lives & Another World which I'd occasionally watch with my mom in the 70's & 80's. So I turned on the TV & figured catching up on some of these classics would help kill some time while I waited for duder to finish this important errand. I'd never seen Passions before so needless to say I was seriously freaked out to see it was full of fairies & witches & monsters & I thought I was imagining it all while wide awake. Was seriously a more terrifying experience than when I saw The Exorcist at the age of 5 & was all around a mind blowingly amazing time. Ya boy was mad stoked! Eventually duder came back & I did what I needed to do to take the edge off & went back home & told my girlfriend I was imagining a bunch of weird stuff while watching soap operas & she just laughed & said, ""Honey, that's Passions."" So on that day Passions became my favorite soap of all time & has held the top spot ever since.",/review/rw0642230/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2000,fadetodeath,," I felt Passions needed a positive comment...
","The only review for this show is one and only after it being on for a few days. Yes, I too felt the same way when ""Passions"" first came on. It was poorly acted, poorly directed, and it seemed so unreal. However as it finally caught my eye to watch the effects have gotten better, as well as the script, the direction, and the acting. And who couldn't fall in love with an adorable life-like doll named Timmy? If you haven't seen the show, go and watch! If you have seen it and disliked it the first time (believe me, I was the same way) go watch it again. You'll understand why it's stayed on for the year that it has.",/review/rw0642230/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2004,di_Notte,," Oh sweet God, why...
","...I'll tell you why. This is the perfect soap for anyone who likes Mystery Science Theater. I myself obssess over MST3K, so it fits well with me. My mom got into it after seeing Timmy and Tabitha, and she's one of the most outlandish people I've ever known so of COURSE she's going to get into this. So it's all her fault. Can I ask some really serious questions though? #1- The idea of Teresa's child being taken away. Um, this whole idea just could NOT happen. They'd need more solid proof to not even allow to see this kid, let alone take him away. #2- As in any soap these people are supposedly rich, or have jobs that MAKE them rich. Yet when do we see them working? #3- Back to the idea of Teresa... she loves her kid to death right? Then why have her mom, Pilar, watch him for two straight months (or was it 3?) while gallavanting in LA? Okay, I digress; this storyline was supposedly like what, a week? But it TOOK two or three months to get the point across. Which leads straight into #4... #4- Do we REALLY NEED 2-3 months to see if Teresa and Ethan KISS or not??? Come the flip ON. Let's get this moving. By the time the whole Sheridan getting her baby back storyline concludes, the ""baby"" will have to be technically 15 years old. #5- Luis beats up a doctor, two orderlies, and Antonio all in one day at the psych ward, and he wasn't taken to jail with huge amounts of bail?? No matter the soap ridiculousness, that was just... ridiculous. #6- On a slightly serious note, at least with the whole Sheridan&Luis/Antonio&Beth storyline, as crazed as Beth is, was it not just mean for Luis to just DUMP her butt when Sheridan came back? And as much as this kid was kidnapped, he doesn't know that and is giving her the shaft completely. Same kinda thing with everyone on the show who has a baby right now... which is just about EVERYBODY at this point. Kinda teaches guys that it's okay to fall for other chicks, or dump the ones you have and not pay attention to your baby. Nevermind the girl. Like that scene with Kay, Charity, and whatshisname (can't remember suddenly): ""Oh, the hospital called! We can take our baby home! Why don't you go home and put the crib together?"" ""But me and Charity have plans to go skating,"" Uh-huh. #7- This is just a stupid point, but I've just NOTICED it... the fact that Charity (who is just too darn goody goody for my taste) WON'T STOP LEANING FORWARD AND LOOKING ALL ""HO-HUM"", PUTTING HER HANDS IN HER POCKETS AND ROCKING BACK AND FORTH ON HER FEET. It's SUCH a stupid pointless point, but I find it annoying anyways. #8- Does anyone honestly stand around, saying out loud ""I WILL get your husband. Even if I have to kill your son and mother-in-law to do so. I just need my uncle to return from the Cayman Islands. But just you wait."" when someone leaves the room... and do you not only do it that one time, but say the SAME darn phrase everytime you feel like it???",/review/rw0642230/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2002,sibisi73,," Talk about a mindf**k!
","I caught a few episodes of this show while on holiday, and it has scarred me for life. Will I ever get it? I doubt it. I have recurring nightmares about Dorothy and Toto being attacked by a chainsaw wielding Tin Man (the estate of Baum should sue for major defamation!). Actors who can't sing burst into song, zombies burst out of graves, Juliet Mills bursts out of her tree (and straight out of Sir John's will if he's got any hope of saving the family name!) This is the most incredible piece of TV I've ever seen - you MUST see it, if only to convince yourself that NOTHING will ever be this bad ever again. Maybe I'm missing the point (?) but since I got back to the UK I just can't get it out of my head. My life will never be the same...I have ""Passions"" needling away at my brain and I NEED SOME MORE......",/review/rw0642230/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2006,tamitiafo,," What happened?
","I used to really enjoy this soap when it started out in 1999. The story lines and characters were interesting, intricate and refreshing. But after about 3-4years, the plot just went downhill. The soap was using the exact story lines when it began, the constant same struggles of the truth comes out, oh no it doesn't, and here is comes, and again no it didn't, and it goes on. The dialog and plot is repetitious,there is essentially no development in the characters, they make the same mistakes over and over, and over, they remain in the dimension that they were first portrayed or they become senseless characters the lack any senses. I understand the soaps don't really need to make sense, but certain things like ""sitting and standing"" shouldn't be too hard to do for people with legs that work. I really still love all the actors and actresses that still put up with such horrible writing. I really hope someone can come in and bring the refreshing and complex writing this soap once possessed.",/review/rw0642230/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2006,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,10," A classic NBC soap!
","Ah, yes. I can remember not too long ago. At that time, one thing I would do each weekday was watch this classic soap opera. From that moment on, I was hooked on it. In addition, If you ask me, Alistair (John D. Reilly) really is diabolical. You would have to have seen some of the things he's done if you want to know why. I also enjoyed the days when Luis (Galen Gering) was on the show. Ever since Beth (Kelly McCarty) left the show, I haven't watched it as much. You'd have to have seen the show between 1999 and 2005 if you want to know why. However, this is still a good soap opera. In conclusion, I highly recommend this classic soap opera to all you die-hard NBC fans.",/review/rw0642230/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2008,noneabve1947,1," Ed Wood could have done better
","I used to watch ""Dark Shadows"" and liked it. Of course I was a kid, it was the era of rebellion, and I thought Barnabas Collins had a great haircut. ""Passions"" is the work of morons with word processors. They hit the last straw with an orangutan in a nurses outfit!!! Sorry, if I want classy T.V. I'll go with reruns of ""Dukes of Hazzard"". (sarcasm) In all honesty, most T.V. shows ARE soap-operas. In a more refined version of the genre, the sub-plots of ""The X-Files"" went on for the entire run of the show. Same with shows like ""Boston Legal""...a nite- time ""soap"" and tons-o-fun!! Any show is cool if you get into the characters and the plot line, no matter how weird. I can't stop watching ""South Park"", for example. Well, that's my beef for the day. I just can't believe a show like ""Passions"" is still on...... Robert",/review/rw0642230/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2017,Kirpianuscus,," Tabitha and Timmy
","after decades, the basic motif for remind ""Passions"" as a good soap opera are Juliet Mills and Josh Ryan Evans performances. not only for the supernatural as spice for a series not real different by the others from the same genre, but for the science to give an open door to a huge circle- trajectories for almost each character. the black magic as element to explain, manipulate, proposing tension to plot is, in many episodes, childish but it becomes a pillar of a fragile construction. and this virtue is far to be insignificant. so, Tabitha and Timmy. and, sure, the rest of characters.",/review/rw0642230/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2006,lirpa77,," Full of laughs
","I started watching this when it first came on. It was with a group of us in college who would make sure and put our classes around the time it came on. It is classic soap format! It is goofy and funny, not at all serious. They do try, but it just turns out to be funny. And the men, have I mentioned them...they all have wonderful bodies, and a tradition with Passions is to make sure they have their shirts off at anytime appropriate (or inappropriate)! I, unfortunately, have become addicted, and know it's ridiculous, but still watch. The best part of this show is the love triangles...there is always at least two going at all times. In one case it's Gwen, Ethan, and Teresa. Teresa is almost a stalker when it comes to Ethan, and Ethan has a real passionate love for her, but because of some good lies, Gwen has him. I want Teresa and Ethan to be together, but Gwen is the one whom he is married to...what do you do?? It's these triangles that keep me watching.",/review/rw0642230/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2003,JenEyre83,," A Badly done but hysterical show!
","When this show first began in 1999 I thought it was the worst and the least intelligent thing on television. Then in 2002 I started watching it again to discover its humor.  If you look at this show as a satire of all other soap operas it is extremely hysterical.  Yes there is bad acting, inane plots, horrible special effects, but that is the joy of a show like Passions. It doesn't try and act like it is a quality show and makes fun of itself plenty to prove it.  So if you are looking for an hour lacking in mental stimulation and exceeding in laughs tune into passions.",/review/rw0642230/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2001,Angel-Marie,3," This show's too slow!!
","That's right! The storylines are way too long. I find myself watching All My Childern and Bold And Beautiful (they air at 1:00 and 1;30 in my city). The actors are great, I love their acting but the constant slow paced stories make the show about as stale as a old doughnut.

","I finally watched this show again recently for a third time and was again annoyed. Now Sheridan is still in a pit in labor. I thought the girl who plays Beth looked familiar and I came to find out show has been a in a bunch of adult late night soft core films on late night HBO and Cinamax aka (Skinamax) movies. The acting on that show keeps getting worse and with Kelly McCarty  aka ""Beth"" addition has made it worse. I felt bad for that guy who played Timmy that was awful. The show is still really bad though. I don't know why people including me from time to time watch this tripe.",/review/rw0642230/?ref_=tt_urv
