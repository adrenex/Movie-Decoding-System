14 April 2006,emma_o17,," Loved it!
","Waterloo Road is a brilliant programme which every one should watch. It is a comprehensive school in England which is right at the bottom of the league tables and the kids there are worse than you could imagine yet pretty much jokers at the same time. Jack (played by Jason Merrells) is the head of the school and yet is drinking after three minutes of being it! Kim (played by Angela Griffins) is head of pastoral care who is an adult who actually listens, and Andrew(played by Jamie Glover) is the deputy head trying to rescue the school. There are tom and Lorna (played by Jason Done and Camilla Power respectfully) who were to be married when it turns out that Tom is in love with Lorna's best friend, Izzie Redpath (Jill Halfpenny), the drama teacher! What will happen there? There is also Donte Charles and Chlo Grainger(played by Adam Thomas and Katie Griffiths; Chlo is Izzie's daughter)who are a match made in hell. Will the relationship survive or will Izzie break them up? But the ultimate question on every one's lips is will the school actually succeed in its inspection? We'll have to wait and see! Watch it...BBC 1 Thursdays 8:00pm",/review/rw8720996/?ref_=tt_urv

","I absolutely love this programme. As a 15 year girl in year 11, it really appeals to me. But to be honest, its 10 times worse than my school. But i think it is a great school for a city school.",/review/rw8720996/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2007,mizzbl,9," Excellent!
","Waterloo Road is a gritty real life school drama, which I have to say is more realistic than others on T.V lately. There are many great British actors in this show, such as Jill Halfpenny, Nick Sidi, Angela Griffin and Denise Welch. This gives the show the edge over other television school shows I believe. With dramatic and sometimes even scary story lines, I cannot think of many better programs to watch on a Thursday night, and i think that if more people would give it a chance, many more thousands of people would love it! Many of my friends love this show, but we all have to agree that the story lines can sometimes be a little rushed because the series are very short. But with this series set to be longer, and the DVD box set of series one coming out in March, I am set for watching back to back episodes!",/review/rw8720996/?ref_=tt_urv

",Here in Australia we are now being treated to four episodes of WR a week. Perhaps it is this rapidity of going through the series (we are now well into Series 3) that reveals the major problem with this offering.,/review/rw8720996/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,9," Great show!
","The show started off a little slow, but it has improved a lot over the years. It is a gritty and compelling look at pupils and teachers at a comprehensive school and the situations they get into. The series is well filmed, with excellent photography and the school itself looks imposing. The writing is engaging and well written, and the stories are compelling and well structured. And the acting is surprisingly good, not the amateurish sort of acting I have seen but it is good. Denise Welch is excellent as Steph as is Angela Griffin and the students are all quite believable with good chemistry. The music is also good, it does stick in your head and is easy to remember.",/review/rw8720996/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2006,xsally90,8," Waterloo Road - great!
",I was hooked from the first episode and hadn't missed a single one except from the second to last one of the first series! I was gutted! Waterloo Road had been compared to Channel 4's Teachers but I hadn't seen it - I had wanted to watch Waterloo Road because Jill Halfpenny was in it and I think she's a great actress after seeing her on EastEnders and Chicago in London. ,/review/rw8720996/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2017,ricardo_edm,4," Entertaining in a Scary Way
","I can see the appeal that this series had when it originally aired. I've had the chance to ""binge"" on it and at times it's been quite entertaining. However, maybe because I'm watching the episodes without the need for interruption, the plots are quite fresh in my memory from installment to installment. The series suffered a horrible lack of good writers. The plots didn't only push credibility but at times were completely wacky (a student gets expelled for cheating but one who poisons all his classmates isn't). It was also interesting to watch how none of the good guys seemed to pay any consequences associated with their actions and miraculously reappeared in the next season without a blemish. I also found interesting how the description claims that there is a school like this everywhere in Britain, which I found scary because if students are allowed to behave like this kids do it is no wonder Britain is having the myriad problems it's having",/review/rw8720996/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2007,daisyatkin123,," Well worth watching!
","I just watched the first episode of the new series last night, and I have to say that it was absolutely fantastic - a bursting start to the new series! The series this time deals with bullying as a main issue, and this, I know is close to many people's hearts. I believe that by broadcasting stuff like this, it will get people to see just what life is like in some of the more deprived schools of the UK. The series also deals with some staff and adult bullying, as well as the slimy Lorna trying to get her ex-husband back off her best friend - SHE says she's not doing anything, Izzie knows otherwise, and feels threatened. It is going to be a shaky term at Waterloo Road this year, but after the bang of the first school day, things will, er, hopefully improve!",/review/rw8720996/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2012,ethan_3000,6," Now I Don't Know What To Think
","OK I have been watching Waterloo Road for quite a long time now. Back in the day this is what everyone was watching and I could understand why. It was very entertaining with the characters having their own dedicated episode at times and other factors of school life. But from 2009 to now I don't really know what to make of the programme anymore. The characters have all changed and so had the management. The issues that came up with either too far or unrealistic. And now the programme is quite unrealistic to me. I personally don't understand why they changed so much and involved diar situations like murder, fire and freak accidents that you simply wouldn't see. Also the situations between characters are also verging on either weird or simply cheesy which I simply cannot watch because I am embarrassed for them. Overall Im still watching but I think that it is unfortunate in what is happening with the programme overall now.",/review/rw8720996/?ref_=tt_urv

","Waterloo Road is a show I've been watching since the beginning in 2006. It was about a troubled school where students were beating the living crud out of each other and the teachers struggling to cope with the students, and their own personal matters. ",/review/rw8720996/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2006,chuckewe,6," For a school, the staff don't seem to be very clever
","I like the BBC, a lot of my favorite shows over the years have been broadcast on BBC America. One of my favorite aspects of BBC productions (At least those broadcast here in the U.S.) is a series season is short, and rarely does a show outlive it's time, lingering on because the characters have become a part of our routine.",/review/rw8720996/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2021,nikesterfun,10," Amazing
","I have watched this show the whole way through once and up to season 7 twice and I'm rewatching it again. Absolutely love this show, I can rewatch it so many times. However, as the show goes on they seem to repeat story lines but it's alright because they find a way to make it interesting and different. So much drama. So much amazing plots. So many amazing characters. Best show ever. Strongly recommend.",/review/rw8720996/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2011,liamdegruchy,9," Mesmerising!!!!!
","I am so excited about the seventh series starting this Wednesday because Waterloo has captivated me for weeks. As a 14 year old school boy I feel like I can really connect with the story lines of some of these kids and really get a sense of the variety of issues facing other young people today. This show does the one thing Coronation Street, Emmerdale and all the other big soaps fail to do and that is really highlight the real problems young people face today.",/review/rw8720996/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2007,lbaldwinsmith2003,8," Waterloo Road is a drama based around a school with every day issues: in the staffroom, between teachers and students, around the school and family issues
","I gave Waterloo Road a rating of 8 out of 10 because I thought and feel it is a brilliant drama. I prefer it to all of the soaps and drama's that I have watched in the past; the drama stars better actors, it has a brilliant story line compared to the usual soap/ drama which fail to keep up a storyline. The other drama based around a school is Channel 4's 'Teachers' which was some way 'Waterloo Road'. The other TV show that is similar to 'Waterloo Road' is Channel 4's soap 'Hollyoaks' which acting is extremely unbelievable, the storyline is of a bad quality and is aimed at a younger target audience.",/review/rw8720996/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2019,xyz49271,7," Excellent but..
","As with most great long running dramas the plots get a little too absurd after the 4/5 season & WR is no exception. After Izzy's death I loved how Tom, Cho & Mika bonded as a family & grew. For the first few seasons this dynamic is the main underlying storyline that held the show together. After the girls graduate & go off to Uni the plots get lost.",/review/rw8720996/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2014,djpl-719-841133,1," What a combination of unadulterated nonsense
","As a Uni lecturer I had heard about this so call 'drama' series and most of the comments were, not to understate the desperation of the writers, so absurd as to be dangerous. OK it's fiction, the land of make believe, problem is it is being screened to impressionable youth. Some of these will believe what they are seeing and hearing. Others will see an outlet for fantasies. No school I know of and and I meet teachers and pupils from many, none come even close to this rubbish. That the UK education authorities and Govt go along with the portrayal of teachers and pupils in such a bad light is astounding. Bullying, homophobia, bad classroom behavior is already far too prevalent in classrooms and school grounds, this over emphasis of it and the blasé' approach by some teachers in this 'drama' is an indictment on the level TV Executives will go to ensure profit. Any writer worth their reputation wouldn't touch this trash with a barge pole, the actors!! obviously the scrapings from the barrel. Research shows teachers having multiple affairs with colleagues, Principals rorting school funds, being blackmailed, on drugs and one would be sex (aging) kitten, flaunts not only her over mature parts to fellow teacher but students as well. This is TV at its worst, to average 4 million viewers steadily shows there is a dedicated number of kids living in a non existent world divorced from reality.",/review/rw8720996/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2006,jeremyscholes1200,," Shaky start but worth watching
","Difficult to say whether this series set in an under-achieving inner-city comprehensive is meant to be a comedy, a drama or a comedy-drama as there are elements of all three. Jamie Glover as Andrew plays the ex fee-paying school English teacher who comes to Waterloo Road as Deputy Head and initially he's coming over as a cold fish though with indications that he will develop into the saviour of the school. Ex Coronation Street actress Angela Griffin is the pick of the bunch as the very human and humane humanities teacher and in fact the show seems to be a haven for ex-Corry actresses with Jill Halfpenny, Denise Welch and Judith Barker (the second Mrs Ken Barlow) joining Ms Griffin and I see from IMDb that Chloe Newsome will soon make it 5 unless she was in the first episode and I missed her.",/review/rw8720996/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2010,csuperman,8," Way Better Than Skins
","I've only recently discovered this series, after having been persuaded, for quite sometime, by people less intelligent than I to watch it (my younger cousin and other tweenies). It took persistent persuasion, on their part, because on the outside there appears to be absolutely nothing to this show. The circumstance is all too generic (Grange Hill, Teachers, Holly Oaks) and y'know ... you just can't trust British television anymore. But then I gave this show my time of day and, believe you me, it's the reason you're told to learn what you judge. ",/review/rw8720996/?ref_=tt_urv

","Waterloo road is a show based in a troubled comprehensive school in rochdale, just outside of manchester. Every day, there are ups and downs and twists and turns that make the show so interesting. As the seasons go by, we meet new characters that shape the show. However, some may not find the show very interesting as every episode is set in the school, which gives the show a boring one and week, low quality feel. However, i guarantee that if you watch waterloo road, you will like it to some extent, especially if you attended a comprehensive school in the mid-2000s and can relate to the themes covered by the show :))",/review/rw8720996/?ref_=tt_urv
