20 December 2022,tylerwoodrownichols,3," This is barely a documentary
","I just watched this, and it was an alright way to pass the time, but don't expect anything great. There is no clear thesis and honestly I was expecting to find out more about her ""true"" identity. Most of the people who are interviewed are only tangentially connected to her, like that one woman from Madd TV or Raven-Symoné (the latter is utterly insufferable). The only compelling storylines are the theatre she defrauded in Seattle and the attorney who was involved in suing her employers. It's a shame because it seems like there really is more to the story, but you might as well just read the Wikipedia article about her. Having said that, it served its purpose as background noise while I was working on something.",/review/rw8750703/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you were alive and aware in the 90s through the early 2000s you know who Miss Cleo is. A tv psychic that eventually was caught up in a lot of fraud charges. This documentary promised to delve in to her past let the viewer know who she really was. The problem is that it never really does that. It hints at what the truth is but never really lays it out. I assume because the movie makers don't actually know, which begs the question, why make an expose about a person you don't really know anything about? It does expose past fraud she was involved in like stealing money from a small theater group in Seattle and lying about cancer for sympathy. Then it goes on to detail how she became the face a billion dollar fraudulent psychic network that cheated countless people out of money they probably didn't have to waste on lies. The weird part is that towards the end of the documentary it seems to try and make you sympathize with her due to her activism in the gay community. I'm not saying she is Hitler but she is clearly a con artist that stole money from vulnerable people and was apparently not the least bit apologetic or willing to take responsibility for her actions. Not the kind of person someone should try to lionize in my opinion. Would have been much better if it has stuck to the premise. 4/10.",/review/rw8750703/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2022,layofthelastsurvivor,2," Quick and lazy documentary
","Parroting the other low reviews, really missed the mark. Almost no direction or attempt at trying to build any kind of interest. Just snagged the low hanging fruit.",/review/rw8750703/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,JuniorAndTwinsFanForLife,5," Outlook Not So Good
",I'm what you would call a Miss Cleo superfan. Back in grade school my friends and I used to regularly participate in all the juiciest Miss Cleo playground rumors and gossip. We also used to quote Miss Cleo's commercials all the time with our best (worst) Jamaican accents.,/review/rw8750703/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2022,sarahbuhlman,10," Put it on for background noise and was sobbing by the end
","I had no intention of being actually engaged with this but was sobbing by the end. Miss Cleo was just some hack from 90s infomercials right? Who knows, but she was also a human with a life and a soul and trauma with people who loved and cared about her. I can just hope that people in my life look back on my mistake sworn as much grace and forgiveness as the people that love her looked back on her.",/review/rw8750703/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,katiekat641,1," Don't Waste Your Time
","This documentary is just awful. Incredibly biased on Ms. Cleo's behalf. The woman was a scam artist but this film tries to make you feel sorry for her, while offering up no proof at all. Just drones on and on about meaningless things that have no real connection to the subject matter. Just another blatantly biased documentary that was cobbled together to revise history and push an agenda. Most of the people interviewed have little to no actual connection to Ms. Cleo. The ones who do are biased and there are no conflicting or contrasting views presented. Also, Raven-Symoné is absolutely intolerable in this. Why is she in it in the first place?",/review/rw8750703/?ref_=tt_urv

","I rated this a 7 because I was engaged the entire time, but wished it had went deeper.",/review/rw8750703/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,kevin_robbins,7," It's impossible to not get nostalgic watching the commercials
","Call Me Miss Cleo (2022) is a documentary my wife and I watched on HBOMAX last night. The storyline follows the 1990s infomercial icon and what little information is available about her upbringing, rise up the psychic ranks, fall from grace and life through her final days.",/review/rw8750703/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2022,imvaughn,8," Great Documentary. Call Me Now!!
",I really enjoyed this documentary. I remember Miss Cleo from my childhood but didn't know much of her story. It was interesting learning about the lawsuit and hearing from her friends. It seems like she was a really kind soul who wanted to help people.,/review/rw8750703/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2022,pdxqraj,10," Capital Theft at It's Finest
","Engaging documentary regarding an iconic Black woman that was skewered in the public arena. Heartbreaking to hear of her humble, tumultuous beginning that inconclusively led to her poor handling of affairs later in Seattle and beyond. The Miss Cleo commercials couldn't be avoided in the 1990s and early aughts, as she was an engaging being. Fallout from the scheming duo that devised the Miss Cleo brand seem to have buried the person, while leaving the business moguls unscathed. Miss Cleo, her patrons and the company employees were all used and mistreated. Glad to see that this documentary illuminates this cautionary tale for anyone with a tremendous, personal talent that can be abused.",/review/rw8750703/?ref_=tt_urv
