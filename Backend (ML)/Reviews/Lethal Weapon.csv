18 June 2022,paul_haakonsen,6," A nicely paced thriller...
","Sitting down to watch the 2021 thriller ""The Good Neighbor"" was because I had the opportunity to do so. I hadn't even heard about this movie from writer Ross Partridge and director Stephan Rick prior to watching it. But I will say that the movie's synopsis sounded interesting enough to catch my attention. And also the fact that the movie had Jonathan Rhys Meyers on the cast list helped to sweeten the deal.",/review/rw8420530/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,gab-67599,7," Ok
","Just ok, a bit long and very predictable. I myself LOVE Meyer as an actor but he just didn't mesh well with the other lead actor. His emotions and reaction at times were laughable because they felt so fake or unreal. I really only wanted to see this movie because he was in it but not that I have I wish I hadn't. Was it a good thriller? Yes, but nothing new or special. Good for a one time watch, MAYBE two, but that was it. Never found out why the girl was on her bike, on that road at night in the first place, but oh well.",/review/rw8420530/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,Xstal,4," 'I'm Sucking out the infection'...
","A hit and scum driver, with a new friend and adviser, takes you on a journey, as if you're nailed to a gurney, the acting's rather poor, absolutely nothing to adore, no method to the madness, just a pool of soiled badness.",/review/rw8420530/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2022,hampersnow-41369,4," Interesting only for the stupidity of it
","The Good Neighbor makes no sense. It's filled with wild, improbable coincidences, and worst of all stupidity. It has one likable character, the supposed villain played by Rhys-Meyers who at least comes off as a sympathetic character, while the actual lead comes across as a moron you will have problems rooting for. But mainly this movie stinks and is also worth watching, just to count how many ridiculous things take place. The lead kills a woman by accident, feels horrible guilt over it but becomes involved with her sister even though he's trying to cover for the accident ? A woman who loved her dead sister becomes involved with a newspaper reporter she turns to for help in finding out who killed her, when she could have gone to the police ? She has an affair with him even though she's grieving her dead sister ? The editor of a newspaper is murdered and no one seems to even notice he's gone ? Rhys-Meyers just kills people and this is all explained away with some line about how he never had a brother ? This movie is incredible in how ridiculous it is. The European location is very beautiful, Rhys-Meyers does a good job playing the looney neighbor and it's actually great that he turns him not only into a likable character, but one I was rooting for. I just don't think that is what the film makers intended. This is not a good movie.",/review/rw8420530/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2022,anne-13622,8," Beware of thy neighbor
","Two neighbors strike up a friendship that quickly spirals out of control when an accident happens that changes both lives. This movie, while a little predictablble in the sense, that as a viewer you know that this friendship can't end well, is straight forward, and was well done. Johnathan Rhys Meyers definetly carries it, but the other actors are ok too. Pacing sometimes a little slow, but overall good.",/review/rw8420530/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,jimbo-53-186511,5," Great performance from Jonathan Rhys Meyers, but only an average film overall
","When two newly acquainted neighbours decide to go out for a drink together their lives change for ever when they knock a cyclist down on a quiet road on the way back from the club killing her instantly. Rather than do the right thing both men flee the scene. Worse is to follow when journalist David (the driver responsible) is assigned with the task of investigating his own crime, but he also starts seeing the victim's sister Vanessa whom is unaware of David's true identity...",/review/rw8420530/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2022,cynthia-58624,8," What would you have done?
","This one of those movies that starts out with the question what any of us would have in the same situation as the protagonist. What if you did something bad and you could get away with it? Has been done before. But the performances are really strong. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is great in his mix of subtle and all out moments. Luke Kleintank does a good job, being relatable while at the same time going down a slippery slope. The film has a retro feel in its premise, and also the pacing is not superfast, but the tension rises constantly to a surprising climax.",/review/rw8420530/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,Neptune165,4," zzzz zzzz zzzzz
","This movie would have me upset with each scene cause it unrealistic. The Good Neighbor is about a budding friendship between two very different neighbours that takes a tragic turn when David runs over a young woman and causes her death. The plot start up fairly decently but the moment it reaches the second act it loses its way between trying to explore the character of David who's living in constant regret and fear of getting caught specially after the victims sisters approachs him for help and the arc of Robert his friend who slowly starts showing his true colors when he loses the grip of the situation. Even from the entire plot's perspective every move seems predictable to a point that you can relate the entire movie to different other flicks who did the same thing in a way better an inventive way. To be honest I want to like this movie a lot but can't find one reason that makes it original or entertaining at all. Intriguing at first, the plot became predictable toward the end. It had a decent premise and the acting was stellar throughout. Unfortunately this Hitchcock like drama fell apart with inconsistent character development and plot twists.",/review/rw8420530/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2022,srauly,3," It kept my attention, but there was too much wrong about it
","As stated in my title, the movie kept my attention and felt like a pre-2020 movie, albeit of middling quality (which is more than I can say about most 2020+ movies).",/review/rw8420530/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2022,arungeorge13,4," A thriller that gets progressively more uninteresting! [+40%]
","Stephan Rick's thriller starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Luke Kleintank dips heavily during the middle and doesn't ever recover. It has an intriguing Latvian setting and a somewhat contrived premise, but what keeps you initially interested is how the lead characters react to the situation(s) they find themselves in. We only get a generic sketch of who they are, what they do, and what comprises their immediate past. The script doesn't bother to give you more details, neither do the performances carry enough heft to make you care. Between the two, Meyers comes up with a much better show since Kleintank's essentially a ""tree trunk"" during the entirety of the film. As an ardent thriller-enjoyer, I'd say this one bites the dust pretty quickly.",/review/rw8420530/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2022,HumbleMensa,4," Nope
","Predictable and VERY slow at some points, although the story is handled well --but it isn't a new storyline. The jury is out on this one, but I wasn't thrilled by it -- it not good and not bad, I guess. I don't think I'll watch it ever again though and super glad I did not pay for it directly. Rhys was okay, but his character --well, seems he's just playing himself, lol. Oh, and fix the subtitles - spent five minutes during a seemingly pivotal scene fiddling with our remote and settings thinking it was just our tech.",/review/rw8420530/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2022,Vivekmaru45,3," Pointless waste of time, a very dull thriller backed by average actors.
","This is your typical ""for every action there is an equal but opposite reaction"" movie.",/review/rw8420530/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,email-70200,8," Good, tense thriller
","This is a good little thriller. Jonathan Rhys Meyers certainly knows how to play someone unhinged. You can tell there is something bubbling underneath his surface. I like how the tension slowly rises until the finale. Also the area the movie is shot in is something else. I don't know how much was shot on a soundstage but Riga as a backdrop is certainly a welcome change up. As I said, it is a good little thriller that hopefully doesn't get overlooked.",/review/rw8420530/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2022,martynspetts,5," If only we understood Latvian!!
","Just watched this. A clever and increasingly sinister plot ruined because a significant amount of the content was spoken in Latvian - especially the closing dialogue!! We tried turning subtitles on but the subtitles were not that informative (might have been our broadcaster) - e.g ""Woman speaking Latvian"".",/review/rw8420530/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,kenbo-87360,4," Poor.
","Considering this is a concept that has been done many times before, it brought nothing new or original. JRM is a great actor and he tried his best here, but it just never got going. I thought he was going to be tremendous in a menacing role but the script just wasn't good enough for it to be tested.",/review/rw8420530/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2022,andrewrye-06535,3," A serious plot hole kills it

18 June 2022,aSumuru,10," Hitchcock 2022!
","Possibly one of the best in its genre. Story was excellently paced, plot thickens and builds up to a climax that brings its audience on a roller coaster ride that is only familiar with Hitchcock fans plus a very updated feel. Well done!",/review/rw8420530/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2022,MrBass,4," Subtitles????
",How can a film with large chunks of Latvian dialect in have no English subtitles?!! It's absolutely absurd. A couple of sentences here and there that aren't relevant to the story I could understand but this film has several long conversations that leave you sitting there wondering what on earth is going on.,/review/rw8420530/?ref_=tt_urv

21 June 2022,cahidi,6," The Good Psychopath
","Jonathan Rhys Meyers is the perfect villain in any movie. He plays the wolf-in-sheep-skin parts very well. He was a creepy psychopath in this movie. Too bad the director didn't put him on screen more. They should've made the killing scenes. It would've made this thriller more thrilling. I think those murder scenes would've cranked up the ratings. I mean, what's the point of concealing them when we've already known who's the killer? The killing scenes will add more tension to the story.",/review/rw8420530/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,Leofwine_draca,5," Less predictable than expected
","This drama/thriller turned out a little better than I was expecting, although it's still not great; more average if I'm telling the truth. It starts out unpredictably enough with a relatively likeable lead and fresh scenario, and although slow-moving it does have some minimal tension and twists to keep you watching. One of the best elements is Jonathan Rhys Meyers, very strong in a supporting role and unsettling with it.",/review/rw8420530/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2022,edwardspre,5," ok - but-
","Overall it was pretty decent , but what spoilt it was the alibi of the guys getting the tram the night of the crash at 12.15 (the police accepted this alibi) the girls sister found out that the trams stopped over the weekend at 10.00pm for engineering work without much effort , surely the most inept of police would have checked this out.",/review/rw8420530/?ref_=tt_urv
