13 November 2006,ccthemovieman-1,8," Enjoyable Movie For Teens & Adults
","This is definitely teen fare, but it's very entertaining which means adults would get a lot of laughs out of it. As with any comedy, some of the stuff is really stupid and some of it is really funny. Along the way, you get some of modern Hollywood's secular plugs and a few swear words that you wouldn't want your little ones to hear, but overall, I have little to criticize with this one.",/review/rw0347375/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2007,robb4964,7," Why so harsh?
",I gave this movie a 7 on a scale of 1-10 because I took into consideration it is a kids movie and should be judged as such. When this movie came out I was 13 and of course I enjoyed it much more then as opposed to now but having watched it as a child and as an adult I do remember how much I enjoyed the film as a kid. From the harsh grade of a 4.4 average I assume people where comparing this to complex movies with great plots. Kids should not be subjected to nothing but adult theme. So when you grade the movie remember what audience it was desighned for.As a child I would have gave this movie a 7. Would you drive a metro and act as if it should perform like a porsche?,/review/rw0347375/?ref_=tt_urv

29 September 2007,marsh876,6," Good Fluff
","Sometimes, when I come home tired from work and have a brewski and want to zone out, I feel like a total fluff movie. Richi Rich fills the bill. It moves along, something most movies don't. It's harmless and doesn't require any involvement on my part. The jokes are silly. I can miss some of it on a fridge run, come back to it, and still follow it. In fact, if I don't finish the movie, it doesn't seem to matter. However, it is charming, so I usually do.",/review/rw0347375/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2018,Hollywood_Yoda,7," Underrated Family Film
","Based on the comic strip of Richie Rich, this is an underrated film starring McCauley Culkin in a non Home Alone film. The co-star cast is not so bad either with John Larroquette (Dan from Night Court), Edward Hermann (voice of the History Channel) and Jonathan Hyde (Van Pelt from Jumanji). Christine Ebersole as Mrs. Rich though, was a letdown.",/review/rw0347375/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2005,shneur,6," Not really all that bad...
","This was Macaulay Culkin's first major flop, when he was finally un-cute enough that viewers noticed he couldn't act. Other than that, compared with other mindless, shallow, hopelessly far-fetched pseudo-adventures designed for either very small or very uncritical children, it's really not worse than one would expect. Well, the comic book on which it's based is not exactly Stan Lee eitherÂ… From a pedagogical point of view, one must say that Richie takes control of his situation in the absence of his parents, makes decisions that are largely sensible and practical, and carries them out mostly without adult help. He combines emotional and rational qualities without violating his basic identity as a kid. To me, that's all good, and redeems the entertainment value of this movie for a young audience.",/review/rw0347375/?ref_=tt_urv

21 December 2005,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,9," One of the best Macaulay Culkin films I have ever seen!,
","This is one of the best Macaulay Culkin films I have ever seen. Kudos to him and everyone involved! When this was first released, I had no idea that John Larroquette was in this. If you ask me, his performance as the devious, nefarious adviser Lawrence Van Dough was delightfully entertaining. In my opinion, that was what made this film a fun little romp worth seeing. Also, I really liked the inventions of the zany Professor Keenbean (Michael McShane). Even though I thought that everyone gave a good performance and Van Dough (John Larroquette) was a bad guy, I enjoyed this film very much. Despite the fact that I liked everyone, I hate to admit it, but he was my favorite character. Anyway, I wish everyone lots of luck in the future and look forward to their upcoming projects.",/review/rw0347375/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2003,famelovingboy68,," Culkin's last movie
","Macaulay Culkins's sweet, childish cuteness is at it's climax here, cause he was 14 when it was was released, so he was 13 1/2 when they were filming it. He seemed about as close to growing from boy to man as you can get, while still being a boy. His voice was deeper than in any of his movies back then, and on the verge of growing. The Rich's own $70,000,000,000, and Richie has his own Mcdonald's, extreme roller coaster, a diversion I forget what you call that launches you up in the air and lands you on a mattress, and four wheelers to name a few! Reggie Jackson is his baseball coach and Arnold is his fitness trainer! he has Herbert Cadberry, as his very likable and proper butler. Richie Miraculously possesses all this, while still being likable and not a brat. Mac may seem like a spoiled brat in real life, but I know he's a likable person, his parents just gave him it. he's not like Brad Renfro. Richie has class with a hilarious teacher played once again by Ben Stein, in the same way he plays the economics teacher that gave him his name, only funnier here. The only thing he doesn't have is friends. He meets some sandlot kids, which makes him yearn deeply for friends, so he becomes aqquainted with them. The kids include, the Mr. COOL kid, the overweight kid that eats a lot, the jock, and one that seems stuck-up and bossy until a little later. the villain is the industries top executive, Laurence Van Dough (John Larroquette) who arranges for Richie and his parents to be killed in a plane by a bomb, but Richie wasn't even in it, and his parents survive by floating on the inflatable boat. The action is great and goes on for a long time with violence and weapons, and Cadberry dresses up like a gangster, high tech spying, fatal suspense in the science lab, and a great climax on Mt. Richmore. Profanity, one damn, and one ""s"" word.",/review/rw0347375/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2016,ironhorse_iv,5," While, Richie Rich didn't struck it rich at the box office. It was still somewhat entertaining, even if some parts were indeed poorly made.
","Directed by Donald Petrie, 1994's 'Richie Rich' tells the story of a very rich young boy, named Richie Rich (Macaulay Culkin) whom finds out that his family is being targeted by a very extreme corporate takeover by Richie's father's business partner, greedy Laurence Van Dough (John Larroquette), who seeks to gain control of their empire, plunder their famed family vault and inherit their vast treasures. Left only, with his cunning and youth, and some help from his loyal butler/companion, Herbert Cadbury (Jonathan Hyde), Richie must try to find a way to stop Van Dough, in order to save his parents, Richard (Edward Herrmann) & Regina (Christine Ebersole)'s fortune. Without spoiling the movie, too much, this film is probably best known, today, as Culkin's final film as a child actor. It's sad to see Culkin immediately withdrawn himself from the big screen after this movie, but I can understand, why. First off, the movie bombed at the box office. Somewhat killing what was left of source material of the same name; by 1994, Harvey Comics was no more. Because of that, no studio wanted, Culkin as the main lead, anymore. Another was, puberty hitting Culkin really hard. The cracking of his voice, throughout this film, really shows that. Another problem, was the backstage conflict with his personal's family life. He just started, to sue his parents to remove them as legal guardians in control of his $17 million fortune. So, it really did strain, the actor during production. It really shows in his performance, as he somehow, made the charismatic, cocky, yet eccentric, Richie Rich from the comic book, into a dull, lonely, depressing and gloomy person. I get that, half of that problem, was, due to the awful writing, but it seem like, he was phoning it, in, at times. I would rather have the charming over the top, billionaire of the comics, over this watered down version, any day. At least, that version, he has friends. It's just so weird, to see, Richie Rich, without friends, here. It's not like, he's over-protective, too greedy, fearful, or condescending to others. So, what the hell!? It seems so out of place, that he would be that lonely. I get the fact that some rich people, might get really get lonely at the top, but you would think, he would had some friends on his own, or at least, some people that would act like, they were his friends. After all, some people always love to surround themselves with people with money. So, it doesn't make much sense. It's also funny, that the film has this, ""Money can't buy friendship"" sub-plot message, with Richie. However, that subplot quickly backfires, as one of the adults, bribed some local kids to become friends with Richie. I guess, money can indeed buy you, happiness. Anyways, most of Richie's so-call friends, were kinda boring. They were so generic and one-dimensional stereotypes. First off, you got the girl/love interest, Gloria Pazinski, (Stephi Lineburg) who is somewhat based off, Gloria Glad from the comics. Then, there is the token, black guy, Omar (Joel Robinson) who does nothing, but speak in slang and talk about the projects. Then, you got the wise-guy, Italian kid, Tony (Michael Maccarone) and the fat Hawaiian kid, Pee Wee (Jonathan Hilario). None of them, really seem, like they would, honestly hang out together, in any sort. Honestly, if you think, deep about it, most of these kids, doesn't seem to like Richie, besides his riches. It never really stated out, what makes them, want to continue to help, Richie, besides that. The only character that I found to honestly care about Richie, besides his parents was Cadbury. Cadbury's appearance here was so different from the comics and the 1980's Hanna-Barbera's cartoon version. In that version, a character of Irona the Robot Maid was given, more of a parent-like role, while, Cadbury serve, more like a background character. While, her presence in this film, would had help the story, greatly, due to the fact, it shows, how lonely, Richie is, when he has robot butlers, to take care of him than people. I get why, she was replaced by Hyde's character, story wise. Cadbury is the one that drives the story, forward, following the 'so-called' deaths of Richie's parents. Plus, Hyde does a wonderful job. Who knew, he has a comedy side? It's so cool to see him, here; not being typecast, as the evil, posh British guy, like he normally plays. Another factor is the fact, that the film is already, unrealistic enough with a kid being able to run a company and a Bond's Q, like inventor, Professor Keenbean (Mike McShane). Adding a walking talking robot to that mix, would be already too distracting. I'm already, having trouble, playing attention to the story, with all the celebrity cameos and produce placement, this movie has. Adding, one more badly done 1990's CGI robot would be, too much. The CGI in this film, is already badly dated. Despite that, the movie still has good action. The 1959's ""North by Northwest"" style climatic ending mixed with the 1990's 'Home Alone' antics was fun to watch. Also, the movie does have some funny moments. Mostly with Richie's parents. Even, John Larroquette was somewhat fun to watch, as the villain. I just wish the movie, stay true to the comics, and allow Van Dough to be Richie's uncle. It would had more stakes to the story. Also, the music by composter, Alan Silvestri was pretty awesome! I also, like the fact, most of the film was filmed entirely on location at the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina. In the end, overall: I kinda enjoyed this film, despite the over glamorous lifestyle of the 1%ers. It's not the best Richie Rich adaptation, out there, however, its beats the Christmas themed direct to video sequel, 1998's 'Richie Rich's Christmas Wish', and the 2015's TV Series of the same name, any day. So check it out, if you want to.",/review/rw0347375/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2010,Aaron1375,2," It has Macualay Culkin in it, of course I hated it.
","Yes, I am not a member of his fan club and for the most part I hate nearly everything he was in. My favorite scene with him is the one in ""The Good Son"" involving the cliff. I had a nice laugh with that one. Here there is no such scene and the film might as well be called ""Home Alone 3: this time the kids rich!"" as it has almost the same premise. Granted the parents did not really leave him, but rather got into an airplane crash, but it is essentially the same as that brat is in this one too. So the story is the kid is lonely and tries to make friends, parents disappear after a plane crash, some dude is trying to get all the money for himself and there is no robot like there was in the original cartoon still trying to debate if that is a bad or good thing. All I know is that the film for the most part is cringe worthy, but as I have said I can not stand Macualay at all so I am going to tend to be against anything he is in. I did not like ""Uncle Buck"", ""Home Alone"" or any of the movies he has been in. Except for said scene, ah yes plunge to your death you spoiled sack of...ahem, the only reason I give this movie a two is that there was a joke in it that actually got me to laughing involving this laser or something blowing a chunk out of a stone statue.

","You know what, there was a lot to like in this movie. Generally, cartoons don't translate well to live action movies, but I'd say that this one wasn't too bad. Earlier in 1994 ""The Flintstones"" was a major flop, but that's because they diverged from the source material. ""Richie Rich"" stayed true to its cartoon roots.",/review/rw0347375/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2006,lee_eisenberg,2," useless
","I know, ""Richie Rich"" is supposed to be more about making friends than about wealth, but it doesn't work. The whole thing about the cabal trying to seize his money was merely an excuse for what was basically a glorification of money. I think that there's a reason that Macaulay Culkin disappeared after this movie (although that was already coming). There are some clever lines - namely the Michael Jackson comment - but there are plenty of good movies out there, so there's NO REASON to waste your time on this. Also starring John Larroquette, Edward Herrmann, Christine Ebersole and Jonathan Hyde; they probably don't wish to include this on their resumes.",/review/rw0347375/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2006,lordzedd-3,8," Interesting adaptation
","The comic is older then I am, but it still stands the test of time. The richest boy in the world facing off against villainous foes that would take that wealth away is a good one. The cartoon from my childhood still ranks one of my favorites. This live action adaptation is pretty good, but far from perfect. There is still about three complaints I have. One, Mike McShane as Keenbean, Mike is a great actor and a very funny improver. But he's not right for Keenbean. He's too large. Two, Dollar is a rare species of dog, one of a kind as far as I know, the Dollarmation. As in Dalmatian with dollar shaped spots. The dog they got was too small and didn't do all those crazy things to become a hero like in the cartoon. Lastly, no Irona the robot maid. She may be just a robot maid, but she is just as important to the cast as Richie and Keenbean. Macaulay Culkin does a great job as Richie, even though I would have liked to seen his famous sweater with the R on it. But that's minor, I give it 8 STARS.",/review/rw0347375/?ref_=tt_urv

","Richie Rich stars the charismatic, easily-lovable Macaulay Culkin in a role that basically begged for him from the first day of pre-production. Unfortunately, nothing else begged much attention in terms of how Richie Rich conducts itself as a piece of family entertainment. Is it serviceable? Absolutely. Just prepare for a rather long and tedious ninety-four minutes. Kids will appreciate it, seeing their favorite hero from Home Alone getting into more hairy little circumstances, but the true victims, the parents, will likely be contemplating better things they could be doing with their time.",/review/rw0347375/?ref_=tt_urv

","From director Donald Petrie (Mystic Pizza, Miss Congeniality), this is a film that probably got many kids saving their pocket money, I certainly wished I was rich. Basically Richie Rich (Razzie nominated Macaulay Culkin) is the richest kid in the world with unlimited wealth and everything he could ever want. There is one thing thing he doesn't have that he longs for, a normal life with some friends, but one day he sees some kids playing baseball and wants to join them, but they don't want him around. Richie manages to get them to like him however when he invites them to enjoy themselves to his mansion and all its luxuries, including a roller-coaster and a McDonald's restaurant. Meanwhile, Lawrence Van Dough (John Larroquette), the Rich family's executive is planning to kill the family and steal their fortune, so when Richie realises, he with his new friends and trusted English butler Herbert Arthur Runcible Cadbury (Jonathan Hyde) plan to stop him. Also starring Edward Herrmann as Richard Rich, Christine Ebersole as Regina Rich, Michael McShane as Professor Keenbean, Chelcie Ross as Ferguson, Mariangela Pino as Diane Pazinski, Stephi Lineburg as Gloria Pazinski, Michael Maccarone as Tony and Claudia Schiffer as Aerobics Instructor. It has its moments of slapstick for the kids, but it is nowhere as entertaining as Home Alone, especially with Culkin reaching the age of 14 and nearly an adolescent.

","Fair little production has Macaulay Culkin starring as the titled character, the popular comic book hero for the youngest of age groups. Culkin has everything, but lacks companionship from other children. When Culkin's very wealthy parents (Edward Herrmann and Christine Ebersole) are kidnapped by evil company businessman John Larroquette, it is up to Culkin, his butler (Jonathan Hyde of ""Titanic"" fame) and some inner-city youngsters he has befriended to save the day and hold on to the family's estate. ""Richie Rich"" is for younger audiences and will keep most in that group entertained and interested. However, this is far from cinematic excellence.
