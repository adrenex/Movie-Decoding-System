5 April 2018,Sleepin_Dragon,3," I wish I enjoyed it like so many did, it just bored me.
","I feel so bad giving this film a poor rating, because I feel it's important for many reasons, socially, culturally, so important to finally see a principally black cast lead the way in the year's biggest movie event.",/review/rw4062596/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2020,Hitchcoc,5," Dull
","I don't have a comic book background (well I did sixty years ago), so I go into these films without predispositions. This was highly touted because of the title black superhero. And so I embraced it because I like it when barriers are broken. The problem was that the thing was convoluted and endless. I stayed with it to the bitter end but found little to make it unique among its Marvel brotherhood. If anything, it pulled in every cliche one could think of, having a black hero. Maybe the producers will learn from this and bring the guy back. By the way, it didn't deserve all those ""One"" ratings. There were some incredible scenes. It just didn't meld.",/review/rw4062596/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2018,janmanuel2,5," I liked it at first.
",I am between a 5 and a 6 on this. It was vastly overrated by the professional reviewers. I am sure their reviews were politically motivated. I loved the cast but I agree that characters were superficial and not defined as they should have been. I also feel more humor was needed in the movie. This can't compare to other Marvel movies. It's a one shot deal for us. We don't need to hear any more preaching.,/review/rw4062596/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2019,claudio_carvalho,5," Absolutely Overrated
","""Black Panther"" is a great deception for any viewer with brains. The hype creates expectation but the film is absolutely overrated. The plot and the characters are shallow and senseless. The Wakanda society accepts the dispute for the kingdom between the outsider Erik Killmonger and T'Challa without any plebiscite. The villain defeats T'Challa is a fair fight as per the Rules. Then Tchalla´s mother, sister and girlfriend recover him using the powerful plant destined to Wakanda kings. And T'Challa returns to Wakanda in a coup d'état, destroying the aircrafts sent by Killmonger to the spies. W'Kabi and his army support Killmonger and in the end, it seems that everything is all right in Wakanda that seems to have a great division between the social classes. There is also excessive references to the ""birth of mankind"" in the view of the writer. My vote is five.",/review/rw4062596/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wanted to see 'Black Panther' for a while, one of my most anticipated films of this early half of 2018 and as somebody who likes to loves most of Marvel's films. The idea was interesting as was what the film was hyped up to be, the trailer looked great and the high ratings and critical acclaim promised even more. ",/review/rw4062596/?ref_=tt_urv

18 March 2018,anthonycciancio,2," Disappointing
","This was supposed to be the newest and best Marvel movie. It was also supposed to be deeper than a super hero movie. Well, basically all they did was put African-Americans in the role of the main characters and followed the same exact formula of every other Marvel movie ever created. The action was mediocre at best. The villain was good, but at the point when he truly started to flesh out his character, I was bored and realized I was watching a movie. I literally said what was going to happen about 30 minutes before it happened. Now if you like super hero films, which I happen to not but if you do I am sure you will have fun and enjoy this film. But, in my opinion this movie had th intensity of a haircut and was a boring commercial to sell toys.",/review/rw4062596/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2018,PatchesOHoolihan,1," Over-hyped - Not enough effort put into core aspects of a film
","With all the hype surrounding this movie (excellent trailers, Kendrick-curated soundtrack, all-African cast) I thought I was in for something special with Black Panther, as while they aren't remotely the highest quality movies, the Marvel cinematic universe movies are generally pretty entertaining. As it turns out I was wrong, Black Panther was extremely average, I have no idea what these critics/review bots are talking about when they say that it is the best Marvel movie and worthy of ""critical"" praise (as not just a super hero movie but as a movie in general.)",/review/rw4062596/?ref_=tt_urv

","Academy award nominee for best picture? All I can say is, if this is the best example of an action film that has been produced that is actually worthy of a nomination for best picture than this has to be one of the worst years (2018) ever in the history of the film making industry. I mean, as far as a Marvel action film goes, this is definitely above average. The generally anticipated saturation of CGI (Computer Graphics Interface) technology was actually bearable, but the fight scenes were dragged out far too long.",/review/rw4062596/?ref_=tt_urv

","First, this movie has a lot of pointless scenes that achieve nothing, the museum scene with pointless covert operation ending up in killing everyone anyway, that's so not Silent Assassin.

14 February 2018,livinglifing,1," Very disappointing...
","This is my second attempt to review this title. 
I was able to see a screening of this in Europe...waste of time. Predictable and laughable at points, it desperately tries to keep pace with other Marvel offerings but fails miserably. The storyline begins with an extremely promising origin for the characters but instead of capitalizing on this and building on it we move to forced action sequences that are poorly done (horrible CGI). That's where the attempt to keep pace with other Marvel and DC offerings becomes obvious...cliché phrases and over the top reaches to create new ones. Some borrowing from previous Marvel ""technology"" really tried to claim it to it's own, but was sadly obvious. Jordan did an outstanding job portraying Erik Killmonger and Whitaker was great, as always...the rest of the cast fell miles short of bringing these characters to life. It's okay to act with a chip on your shoulder because THAT'S what make hero characters pop...BUT you must act first. As the Marvel scene is beginning to become over saturated, this film at least allows us to take a break from an actual Marvel film.Not good enough to call ""cookie cutter""...",/review/rw4062596/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2019,jkmarin-03431,7," Good movie but completely overrated
","Although this is a really good movie, it has amazing costumes, they really got the essence of a African cultures, the cast, in general, did a good job, it still had some problems, including, special effects, character development, wasting such an actor as forest Whitaker and a really common narrative superheroe story. In general, this movie is fine, as I have stated earlier, but the truth is that the professional critics have judge this movie for the wrong reasons, they have let their political interests overshadow their ability to rate a movie the way it's supposed to be.",/review/rw4062596/?ref_=tt_urv

","Black Panther, directed by Ryan Coogler, tells the story of the new King T'Challa of Wakanda who must learn to handle the responsibilities of this title.

14 February 2018,rodhackenflasch,2," An Exercise In Nonsense
","This thing is being over-hyped to the max. The narrative is promising at the outset, but fails miserably as it deteriorates into the absurd, and then continues to drip like Chinese water torture from the poorly written screenplay. The acting was mostly amateurish with the exception of Forest Whitaker, who seemed out of his element, but the screenplay could very well be the culprit here. The entire production was a laughable exercise in nonsense, and the CGI was worse.",/review/rw4062596/?ref_=tt_urv
