13 January 2020,davidmvining,10," A great procedural thriller on a global scale
","Sometimes I think people just simply watch movies wrong. Looking through some of the negative reviews of Steven Soderbergh's Contagion was one of those moments. It's a procedural movie that is meant to capture the wide-ranging reality of a massive disease outbreak in the modern era, not a three act drama with character arcs. It's simply a different type of movie than a lot of people are used to, so they don't know how to process it. Anyway...",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2021,deepfrieddodo,8," A* For Accuracy
","Having watched during the COVID-19 pandemic, the accuracy of this film released almost 10 years previous is eerie. Contagion does not skip on the science, and every scene was like a dramatic recap of press conferences in reality. The level of detail the filmmakers went into is phenomenal, and they cannot be credited enough. Even beyond the science of a virus, the human reaction is spot on, notably Jude Law's character, a convincing keyboard warrior.",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2020,KoolCatReviews,8," We're only now getting to terms with how realistic this portrayal was
","A deep dive into the eventually of a pandemic. We get the story from the main point of veiw of several characters. A few of the side story's seem unnecessary but on the most part it all fits together like a jigsaw. The film is fast paced and at times can be hard to follow however it show cases its themes well and will keep you interested until the very end. The film does't really end, you just step into 2020.",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2018,perica-43151,9," Most clinical and realistic dissection of real pandemic scenario
","This is a cerebral movie. Many complain about having too many characters, but these characters serve as illustration, the main character is the pandemic, that is explored in non sensationalistic but still interesting and compelling way. The most scary thing about the movie is its realism. Yes, this is what really would happen if there were a pandemic. Not everyone would die, there would be no flashy helicopter drama, but it would not be a pleasant experience either. This is a good movie but perhaps not for the seekers of cheap thrills.",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2020,siderite,9," Realistic. As always, the virus is the least of the problems.
","This is not a zombie movie. It is not an overdramatized race to catch the carrier before it infects everyone. It is a rather realistic depiction of a fast spreading contagion with a high mortality rate. As I am watching the spread of Covid-19, I see numerous parallels with the film. OK, the virus in the movie was way too deadly and with a short incubation period, but that made it more easy to contain. The vaccine was developed incredibly fast, too. I mean, it had to all fit inside less than two hours. In other words, it is describing exactly what is happening now, but at a much faster rate. It is therefore important to note the predictions of this film: idiots spreading rumors online, violence from desperate people, supply shortages on every level.",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2020,hprashantarora,9," Scary!
","I knew this was an important movie when it came out. I had not seen anything like this before. Excellent writing, good direction, an invisible antagonist, and most importantly - a sense of realism.",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2020,cardsrock,8," Stunningly prophetic
","As I watch this film many months into COVID and at the end of my infectious disease/immunology unit in medical school, I'm in awe of how accurate of a portrayal this is of a pandemic. It's truly incredible how many things in this movie come to fruition nearly a decade later. It's a testament to the writer, director, and most of all the scientists who were consulted for this movie.",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2020,redrobin62-321-207311,7," In This Day And Age, A ""Must See"" Film.
","Okay, there's bound to be a lot of similarities with this film to the Novel Coronavirus outbreak that's now reaching around the globe with rapid speed. Of course, ""Contagion"", being a Hollywood film, the virus spread much faster than the real thing as well as caused way more fatalities. As of this writing (2.21.2020) there are 77,767 cases with 2,360 deaths and 20,833 recovered around the world. And that's pretty fast for a virus that was just recognized 12.31.2019 - not even two months ago. Some of the ideas and behaviors in ""Contagion"" seemed far fetched, but in the end, it wasn't really that bad of a production consideration the nature of virus infections tend to be mysterious and unknown in the first place.",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2021,Kirpianuscus,," the real contagion
","Before mars 2020, I saw it as a catastrophic fiction. After mars 2020, I saw it as a prediction or warning or good start point for few conspiracy theories. But the story remains significant for me. I t is Hollywood and that kind of stories are the favorites for reasonable audience. But the cast. The actors and their work are the real subject of this film about vulnerability, family, friends, hopes and death, fears and solutions. And, after a time, you see it being a film - warning about a more profound form of contagion.",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv

",Remember watching this in cinemas back in 2011 & didn't think too much of it after watching. That's not to say I didn't like the film or think it wasn't great because it is. It's more so due to the current events we find ourselves in that I can relate to it more!,/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2020,harry_tk_yung,," Chilling
","I watched this movie when it was released nearly a decade ago. At the time it was to me (just as to everybody) another addition to the genre that is best represented by ""Outbreak"" (1995).
Watching ""Contagion"" it again, I feel a cold shudder down my spine. You get the uncanny feeling that director Steven Soderbergh is one of those Biblical prophets. ""Contagion"" talks about a pandemic getting out of control, about the race to develop a vaccine, about incubation periods (in that movie thankfully less than 10 days), about people's unconscious habit of touching their faces (from 2 times to 1000 times a day, depending on the individual), about tracking down virus carriers (doctor telling such a carrier, urgently over the cell phone, to immediately leave the bus, don't talk to anyone, don't touch anyone), people in power trying to hide the truth, nurses' threat on work-stoppage, The most chilling thing: millions died worldwide.",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2021,hannahjhunter,8," Watching in the Age of Covid-19
","I never saw this film when it came out. I just watched it for the first time. It is really unsettling how similar it is to our current pandemic. Even down to the dangers of conspiracy theorists and anti vaxxers. It was obviously really well researched when it was made as expressions such as ""R number"" and ""social distancing"" which have only recently become things most of us are aware of. The whole bat thing is actually creepily prophetic.",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2021,rajitecture,9," Nailed it!
","It's amazing how close this movie nailed it. This movie probably didn't make a lot of sense back in the day, but now knowing what actually happens in a pandemic, props to the writers. This movie captured it all. I really give them credit for all the key worries related to a pandemic.",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2020,malty-185-488337,8," We're all in the 2020 sequel
","If they'd only called it coronavirus and not Contagion, decent film to watch If you're not to anxious.",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2011,KnightsofNi11,8," Very unique take on the viral outbreak subgenre
","One would think that the last thing we need is another outbreak movie. But that's not the case when the latest of the genre is directed by the always interesting Steven Soderbergh. Contagion wins for this years most ridiculously impressive cast lineup, as it is an ensemble picture about a deadly viral outbreak that affects the entire world. We follow various characters like a man who loses his wife and step son to the disease. We follow various doctors who work to stop the virus, along with CDC officials who must control the spread and influence of the virus. The whole film is a tightly woven dramatic thriller that presents a lot of characters and a lot of ideas, but keeps them all in line and pulls its story off very well.",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2011,Davor_Blazevic_1959,7," Fictional viral outbreak plausibly dramatized in docu-like fashion in an ""effort to accurately represent the science... entertain as well as educate""
","Stephen Soderbergh's latest direction, ""Contagion"" (2011), even though bringing less than expected excitement, is an absorbing movie to watch, efficient as a social and behavioural study, but no less as an accomplished collection of individual case studies, offering sufficiently thought-provoking arguments, such as the fact that--despite all the scientific advances and exhaustive efforts of the thousands of specialists--humankind still stands pretty helpless in the prevention of new viral outbreaks and their many strains occurring globally, when even seemingly well organised societies easily slip into chaos, leaving all individuals to fend for themselves in the ultimate fight for survival, all further fuelled by unstoppable leaks (however, lucrative sensationalism, as well) on an almost inevitable, mutually supportive (money and power shouldn't mix, but mostly they do) corporal and governmental cover-ups. Surely it is a disturbing reminder that even at the most difficult of times, humanity's good traits still get so easily overpowered by the seed of all evil--selfishness and greed.",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2020,the_malbogia,10," In 2011, this movie was probably meh, 2020, most important movie to date.
","Wow... just wow...
Its crazy that this movie is from 2011. It almost like the writer of this film saw it all. So the pandemic, saw the panic, saw the riots, the curfews, saw the conspiracy theories, they saw it all.",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv

9 September 2011,Smells_Like_Cheese,8," Like a tea kettle, it starts hissing, then steams and whistles like crazy, then dies down
","Since 1918 there has been a paranoid fear of a plague spreading around the world once again. It's 2011, how would things be handled? If you're smart, you know how most of the world would handle it, most people would turn into animals while the rich would benefit off the death of others. Movies have been created the past few decades on plagues hitting again, The Stand (even if it's a miniseries), 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead, etc. It's terrifying to think of, hard to grasp even. Contagion was made on a more realistic documentary type of movie on ""what if"" factors. With an all star cast, we find out how fear can spread faster than a virus and what would life be like if everything and everyone we touched could kill us.",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2011,alan-chan-158-451491,," Go and wash your hands...NOW!
","Now go and wash your hands! That's what you'll be doing after you see this film. Contagion is a frightening realistic procedural thriller about the spread of an airborne pandemic virus, its impact on an ensemble cast of characters played by a veritable 'Who's Who' of Hollywood and the subsequent race to find a cure.",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2021,gav_c,9," I never appreciated this movie until now

11 September 2011,danteism,7," Effective, thought provoking, and mis-marketed.
","Not much to say that hasn't been already the critics are right, it is an effective slick movie that may be a bit slight as far as character development but doesn't suffer too badly for it. This is a movie far more about ideas than people and that is not necessarily a bad thing. ",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2011,rgkarim,," And Epidemioligst's dream and a Germophobe's nightmare
","So what comes to mind when you think of a disaster movie? Is it gigantic alien invaders? Is it volcanoes exploding and flooding the land with lava? Or is it the world ending in some fiery, cosmic, or overpowering natural force way? Regardless we've seen various movies that have tried to destroy the human population in flashy, explosion filled ways. However, one movie that released this weekend called Contagion has decided to approach the threat of human extinction in a different way. Was it worth it? Well read on to find out.",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2020,RubyMouse,8," Based on actual epidemiology
","As an epidemiologist, I have to say this is really well put together. Like everyone else, I'm re-watching it now and struck by its prescience. We've all been saying it's a matter of when not if for years so let's hope we all get safely through this one and there is more support for preventative medicine on the other side of this!!",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2012,bob the moo,," The matter-of-fact delivery is both a strength and a weakness but mostly it works
","I came to this film off mixed work of mouth and was interested to see for myself how it plays. With loads of famous names involved, a director I like and a sobering subject, I had decent hopes for it to be at least worth seeing and I knew it wasn't going to be an Outbreak style thriller with against the clock races to catch a monkey or a helicopter standoff against a military bomber. As a result I was reasonably prepared for the film and not put off by how matter-of-fact it was in its delivery. Staying mostly away from hyperbole and false dramatics, the film takes us through the spread of the virus across the world, with the challenge of containing, managing and responding to it.",/review/rw2550384/?ref_=tt_urv
