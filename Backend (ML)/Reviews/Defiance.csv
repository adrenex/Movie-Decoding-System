10 November 2012,poolandrews,6," Enjoyable old school action flick.
","The Expendables 2 starts as ace sniper Billy the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) tells his boss Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) that he wants to leave the Expendables, a team of tough mercenaries who are for hire & take on dangerous jobs that need lots of firepower. Ross accepts his decision, however later that night the sinister CIA man Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) orders Ross & his team of expendables to carry out one last job for him, since Church can have them all jailed for life or killed Ross has little alternative but to agree. A plane has crashed with some extremely important cargo locked in a safe on-board, it's up to Ross & the expendables to find, retrieve & deliver the cargo back to him before it falls into the wrong hands. The mission at first seems easy & all goes well but after finding the cargo Ross & the expendables are ambushed by the sadistic Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme) & his men who steal the precious cargo & kill Billy the Kid leaving Ross & the rest of the expendables swearing vengeance...",/review/rw2693261/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2013,Floated2,8," Action Filled Sequel that Delivers
","Now I enjoyed the original Expendables for what it was but I was felt disappointed in the outcome because of the way it was hyped up and I felt a lot of things could have made it better, and that things were missing. Now years later, watching the Expendables 2 and not having as such high expectations I went into the film excited and thrilled for surprises. I also did not read any reviews or check critics ratings upon watching. I found this to be greater than the original for many reasons. The plot was more focused, the characters were more detailed (we got to like them more), and mainly because of the more well directed intense action scenes.",/review/rw2693261/?ref_=tt_urv

16 August 2012,DICK STEEL,8," A Nutshell Review: The Expendables 2
","The mercenaries are back! And if the response from the box office is stellar, I suppose The Expendables can build upon a formula that's established through the two films to date, that somehow follows how James Bond would have done it, with its longevity inspiring similar treatment. There's the opening big bang action sequence, followed by Bruce Willis' shady CIA operative Mr Church coming on to provide Barney (Sylvester Stallone) and his team a challenge they cannot refuse (by way of blackmail). Technology and weapons go down to bare basics with loads of guns, knives and brass knuckles, with room for a female companion somewhere, against a mob boss played by somebody well known.",/review/rw2693261/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2012,Aaron1375,9," The Expendables are back and stuff gets blown up! What else did you expect?
","I went to this film expecting another fun explosive ride and I got what I was expecting. Lots of explosions, plenty of bullets and numerous kills. I have to say I enjoyed this one a bit more than the last one, I am not sure what the critics were complaining about, but then they were harsh to Sylvester and Arnold's films back in the day too, so I guess I should not expect anything different this go around. And speaking of Arnold, it was great to see him back and part of the action this time. Probably one of the reasons I enjoyed this one a bit more than the second film.",/review/rw2693261/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2012,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,7," The Expendables 2 (2012)
","The Expendables 2 is the ultimate fan service and gives us even more than we got for the first installment. The Expendables 2 sees Barney Ross and his team having to pay back Mr. Church by going on a simple mission of retrieving an item from a downed plane. All goes well until Jean Claude Damme shows up. Van Damme is an excellent villain. He is clearly having a lot of fun and looks damn cool at the same time. The film just builds up to action set-pieces and cameos that don't always make a lot of sense, but are much appreciated. With so much going on, not everyone gets their due. Li has to leave early on to make some room, and Crews and Couture are sidelined for more A-List stars for the finale. The final action sequence what you paid your money for. Stallone, Willis, Lundgren, Norris, Schwarzenegger and Van Damme all taking part in a single action scene. It's great to finally see it but it does go too much towards comedy as the characters trade their famous catchphrases. The film has delivered on its promise even if there is a distinct lull in the second act where the dialogue is cringe worthy and it tries too hard to develop characters we don't really care about. I am now very excited for Stallone and Schwarzenegger's next projects and The Expendables 3.",/review/rw2693261/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2012,troy-manatunga,7," Better than the first movie!
","Barney Ross (Stallone) and his rivet crapping tough mercenaries are neck deep in gunpowder as they infiltrate a terrorist camp somewhere in Nepal. Shooting, stabbing, punching and frying pan fighting (yes frying pans!) gets the team to their target. The objective is to extract a rich Chinese billionaire for reasons unknown. Much like Liam Neeson in the A TEAM, Barney runs into Trench (Schwarzenegger) who has beaten him to the price. However the Terminator has been bested for the time being by the terrorists and is grateful to see his ex-comrade. Simon West and his team of explosive experts blows up the place in a million dollar fashion as the mercenaries take off to the skies in the trusty old Sea Plane. The first thumbs for this motion picture is its special effects.",/review/rw2693261/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2012,dvc5159,6," Welcome back to the '80s
","It takes a certain mindset to appreciate a movie like ""The Expendables 2"". One has to be a fan of the action genre of the 1980s and early 1990s, as well as enjoying those action heroes' persona and screen presence whenever they appear on-screen. They did not necessarily have to act well, but they had to be tough, heroic, stoic, larger than life. Realism need not really apply here - it's all about the fun factor. People paid to see these guys blow away the scum of the earth as they only know how.",/review/rw2693261/?ref_=tt_urv

4 May 2013,adam_evans14,," If you didn't like, well what did you expect?
",So with the release of the Expendables we witnessed a film that possibly can't be repeated in terms of scale. The reason lies with the over the top preoccupation with 'the action flick' in the 80's. So in bringing all these iconic figures of the action genre together the expendables evokes nostalgia among the older audiences while the ignorant can claim they want to see the new Jason Statham film.,/review/rw2693261/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2012,GOWBTW,9," Bring it on, BABY! Bring on the firepower and the mayhem. Keep it coming!
","This sequel did not disappoint! Maximum star power, maximum firepower, maximum excitement. ""The Expendables 2"" was a thrill ride that no one will ever forget. Sly is back with his crew once more, but this time they gain a new recruit: Bill the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) who's a top notched sniper, and Maggie (Yu Nan) who is smart but very gutsy in nature. They bring back all the ones who just had cameos in the first installment. It got more fun when they got Booker(Chuck Norris) "" The Lone Wolf"", and Jean-Claude Van Damme. There's one drawback, he's a villain. The action in the movie was totally non-stop, there was also a lot of humor, clichés, and one liners in the film. So long to list, I can't catch up if I tried. ""I''ll be back!"", is a classic. Sly and Van Damme? An unlikely battle in the making, however, it's a new epic battle anyone can think of. Dolph Lundgren was known for his intellectual talent back in the 80's. He really put it into good use here. If you thought the first movie was something, you haven't seen anything like this. ""The Expendables 2"" is a must see movie for years to come. All star action, all star humor, and just enough adrenaline to keep you alert at all times. Enjoy this movie! 4.5 out of 5 stars.",/review/rw2693261/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2012,Maleplatypus,7," Better than the first one
","So, if ""acting"" does not count (and in this kind of movie it really shouldn't - some deserve a free pass :), everything else is much better than the first movie. Especially the story. Don't get me wrong: it has been obviously designed for a classic black/white presentation, where good guys are always good, and bad are even worse. The are also some quotes on movie classics (you know: terrorized village graving for help, some stranger(s) come(s) and blah, blah, blah) and it is altogether fun. Nice 100 minutes (with credits). Mindless but fun nevertheless. Arnie is finally ""back"" (after so many promises), nobody beats Chuck Norris (I guess jokes about him are true; most of them) and it all looks like a nice geriatric party (only shooting, no singing). Like Space Cowboys (God forgive for comparing this two movies!) but with no space.",/review/rw2693261/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2012,brady-vallbacka,7," Yes it's cheesy, Yes it's dumb but Yes it's fun!!!
","A decent fun action flick that won't disappoint you. I hated The Expendables and was disappointed about all the hype. But this one was a way better film. There actually is a story and talking and not 100 mins of action. This film has cheesy one liners and will not win an academy award but if you're looking to ease back and relax with some buddies to a no brainer-flick this is a good one. Good action and decent screenplay and bad-ass characters featuring Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Jason Statham and more bring a solid action flick that I hope the sequel will be like this one and not like the first one. This is one of Stallone's better action flicks.",/review/rw2693261/?ref_=tt_urv

16 August 2012,omarh92,7," A reloaded *** kicker and better than the 1st one.
","I must admit, the hype for the first film was too much and in the end, we all got some intense 80s style action but with a poor story. This sequel however actually has a story, a story of revenge. The first film introduces the gang so we get to know them. The second however, we already know the gang so now we actually see how they truly are and how they work. This film is better since the rest of the team (other than Stallone) get more screen time and they have their humor moments. Van Dammne played a very very very very very AWESOME villain, and towards the end of the film, he shows even at the age of 50, he is stronger than ever. Arnie and Bruce Willis had a great screen time too with perfect humor, seriously the chemistry between those 2 and the rest is great. Speaking of chemistry, Dolph Lundgren's role is MUCH better now and very enjoyable. Chuck Norris, you'd be surprise how he is. The cast was great, the story is better, the action is MORE intense, there is great humor. In conclusion, Expendables 2 brings back the 1980s action style with it's teaspoon of humor. Enjoy the film!",/review/rw2693261/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2013,Chrysanthepop,," Mumbo Jumboy Boombo
","I wasn't expecting a great script, great acting or even great direction and I didn't get any of those from watching 'The Expendables' (although the direction wasn't terribly bad and Jean Claude Van Damme was actually quite good). Roarke's absence was quite evident (him being the best thing in the previous film). However, the over the top action sequences were entertaining to watch and well choreographed. That's one of the main reasons why such films were popular in the 80s and 90s and director Simon West and Sylvester Stallone know this. This is a homage to those films. The highlight is the final action sequence that's set in an airport where you've got former action film icons fighting alongside and against each other. Chuck Norris's cameo expectedly makes one cringe and there was too little of Jet Li. This is by no means a classic and I hardly would've have missed anything had I chosen not to see it but fans of action flicks (particularly of the 80s and 90s 'era') might consider this a worthy watch",/review/rw2693261/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2019,sauravjoshi85,10," A high octane action movie!!
","The movie is the second instalment of The Expendable series but this movie is better then the first one. The movie lacks a good plot and storyline but compensate with great great action. Sylvester Stallone is as good always, Jason statham justifies his image of a ruthless action hero, Dolph Lundgreen, Terry crews and Randy couture did their job with perfection but JCVD was a little disappointing as a villain, his Character should've been crafted with more perfection. Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Chuck Norris are treat for the eyes. Yu nan hasn't got the opportunity to perform and that's justified coz of lots of stars in the movie. Background music is good and suites according to the requirement. Screenplay could've been made more impressive. Overall a no brainier pure action movie and it'll not disappoint.",/review/rw2693261/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2012,scottedunlap,1," Quote from Billy Madison "" We are all dumber for having heard it!""
","The first thing that strikes me about this movie is, why does it look SO bad? Is it the feel or style they are going for? I dunno, it just looks bad. Maybe they are trying to Vaseline screen the aging stars, who are all in great shape by the way, or are they saving on film? Do they even use film anymore? SPOILER ALERT Virtually every action scene here is over the top and totally unbelievable except for a short scene with Jet Li. The initial escape scene makes NO SENSE! Sly gets shot while going down a seemingly infinite zip line? Statham's got his back so he stays behind while they are surround and the rest of the team continues the escape on the water high speed style. Out of nowhere Sly and Jason are rescued by fledgling team member snipers them out of the situation. Sly grunts ""Time for plan b"" back to the water chase. Jet skis, for no apparent reason appear from nowhere and the team abandons the boat. Just when all is lost, Stallone and Statham zoom overhead in the plane they arrived in. How is this plan b? Wouldn't the boats and jet ski's be plan b. Jet skis shoot into the ramp of the plane as the plane struggles get get enough lift to take off before they crash into a huge damn. Hey, since we are having trouble gaining altitude, let's head for the HIGHEST POINT on the dam! Most of the action scenes pretty much follow this level of nonsense. Oh well, maybe the writing is good? Nope! Back story for the newbie team member to make us care about him when he gets killed pretty much goes like this, ""So, how did you get into this line of work?"" "" I was in Afganistan for three years when my platoon got trapped in the oil zone. By the time we got out, four of my friends were dead. When I got back to base, they had shot the dog I was taking care of, so, I'd had enough killing for the day""! That's it? That's the best the writes of this mega budget could come up with? Also to the character, since you had enough killing you decided to become a mercenary where you would kill people all day! Speaking of death, I read a stunt man died making this POS. people die everyday, on the subway, in their sleep, lots o reasons, but honestly, I can't think of a bigger waste of life than to die for this movie.",/review/rw2693261/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2020,fernandoschiavi,7," The Expendables 2 should not be taken seriously. It does not areas responsible for the logical reasoning, but to those responsible for our affective memories of a simpler time
","The first Expandables received mixed reviews from critics and the general public, but proved to be efficient and fun at various times, in addition to having obtained a high collection at the box office, which soon ensured a sequence. The Expendables 2 is the expected continuation of the film that represented the union of some of the great names of the action films of the 80s and 90s. This time, the expectations were higher: besides Sylvester Stallone, who plays the protagonist, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren and Jet Li (who, this time, appears only briefly), the film features the participation of Jean-Claude Van Damme (in the role of villain!) And Chuck Norris, in addition to more effective appearances by two actors who had discreet appearances in the first film, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis.",/review/rw2693261/?ref_=tt_urv

29 August 2020,fmarkland32,7," Demolition Men...
","This time the rough and tumble commando squad (Stallone, Statham, Lundgren, Crews, Couture and albeit briefly, Li) take on Jean Villain (A wonderfully hammy Jean-Claude Can Damme) and his first lieutenant (up and newcomer Adkins) a brutal crimelord who is trying to get his hands on platonioum, and who has killed one of the Expendables, and while being overmatched our favorite action stars are aided by Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Chuck Norris when things look hopeless in a corny, but ultimately enjoyable entry. The action sequences are a marked improvement as this time there is no lame shaky cam, Lundgren,Crews and Couture are actually really funny, and the movie delivers as expected. In fact this is probably the best entry if only for the premise to hit it's peak .Of course Van Damme makes quite the foil and while the ending (after the final showdown) feels a little out of place, Expendables 2 is the perfect capper to the nostalgia we fans of the golden age of action starring our genre favorites. The only other observation I had, was how the movie that this feels like most, is the 5 Deadly Venom movies in which those Kung Fu movies often introduced each actor who played said venom (despite it not being a sequel) like Flag Of Iron or Crippled Avengers. All in all I enjoyed the first 2 and was so-so on 3, and doubt we will get a part 4, which is too bad cause I wanted Michael 'American Ninja' Dudikoff, Steven Seagal, Nicolas Cage (as the main baddie) and Jackie Chan in it, but I'm happy to see the majority of these genre faves all together one last time on the big screen.",/review/rw2693261/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2012,caseyx,9," Great to see they're still here!
","I saw The Expendables II this morning at a pré screening. What can I tell you about this movie. Firstly, it's really action packed. You're blasted off in the first few minutes leading up to the actual story. Obviously, this is not a film with a great script or impressive acting.However, the story works well for what it's supposed to do! It is greatly entertaining if you are looking for an action packed movie loaded with iconic action stars like Stallone,Willis and many more. The addition of Chuck Norris and van Damme to the cast worked out well. It's really good to see Chuck Norris in action again and he really pulls it off! I expect that the people who will like this movie most will be the fans of the old guard like Stallone, Schwwarzennegger and Norris and the other cast members. Someone I really liked was Liam Hemsworth who did a great job and stood his own between these action giants! Nan Yu as Maggie was also a good casting choice an did what she was supposed to do.",/review/rw2693261/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2012,bob the moo,," Distracting excess but mostly lacks actual excitement or reasons to be engaged
","I do enjoy a good action movie – indeed if I'm honest I also enjoy an average action movie as long as there is lots of noise and action throughout. This was the reason i came back for the Expendables movie even though I had no real expectations of it being any good – at very least I knew that things would explode and that the film would exist in the fantasy world of macho 80's style action movies. The opening scene of the film does leave you in no doubt as to what you are getting, as the team rescue someone from the heart of a fortified town, killing probably hundreds in the first 15 minutes alone. It isn't thrilling but it is very loud and enjoyable for what it is.",/review/rw2693261/?ref_=tt_urv

","You don't feel the testosterone in The Expendables 2 as much as immerse yourself in it, whether you like it or not. It manages to be awesome on several levels – a frantic action movie, a self-deprecating comedy, and okay, that's about it. But still! Explosions that make sense! The mocking of catch phrases! Great casting that doesn't feel forced! Stallone not in the director's chair! Yes, there's so much to like about the movie that we can overlook a lot of clichés and hammy performances. Let's look at the plot. Barney Ross (Stallone) and his team, having bilked Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) out of $5 million in the first movie, now have to make amends. No, Church doesn't have them tossed into Gitmo, and he doesn't kill them.

23 October 2012,d0wen,8," Actually much better than the first + very enjoyable!
","I disagree with some people feeling that this film was no better than the first. It is easily better than the first, which is a very hard thing to do (normally). I thought the first movie wasn't brill but it was OK, it was kind of what I expected but I did expect a bit more in the fight scenes and I felt that Jet Lei just like the story wasn't up to much. Everything Stallone is doing here is a great idea and it has a great feel to it. Expendables 2 has finally got to where the first one should've been. This one is far more enjoyable, the action / fight scenes are better, which is mainly why we watch these sorts of films, but also the characters and their relationships with each other are better. Some of the scenes are pure genius. Some of the scenes are not but hey ho. I am really looking forward to a 3rd instalment but I do feel that they will take it too far and end up with some of the most annoying and worst ones appearing like Steven Seagal and Vin Deisel... I hope not! If they do then they might as well go the whole hog and get the Heather Small bird from M People on there to just totally annoy us all!! ",/review/rw2693261/?ref_=tt_urv
