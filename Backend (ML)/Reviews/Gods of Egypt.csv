","An eerie yet gorgeous tapestry of lingering close-ups; parallels, cuts and slow-motion photography, Lars Von Trier's Antichrist is a gruelling tale of mythical grandeur: a bizarre yet beautiful film chock full of sadism and shagging, Satanic dogma and similes. Most of which, I don't understand. So you'll be pleased to know that I have no intention of harping on about the director's bent meditation on gender, nature, genocide, motherhood, misogyny and astronomy. I find all that stuff interesting, don't get me wrong, but when things get Freudian I'm way out of my league. Therefore, I'll stick to what I know.",/review/rw5550304/?ref_=tt_urv

","Some while back, the consistently atrocious Ewe Boll made a film called Seed. His self-imposed agenda was to produce a horror film that wasn't any fun. On that level he certainly achieved his objective. He managed to fashion one of the most boring, mindlessly gratuitous, unexcitingly violent, plodding, pointless, meaningless and downright time-wasting movies ever.",/review/rw5550304/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2009,Likes_Ninjas90,4," The self-proclaimed 'best film director in the world' is not interested in finding resolution for these characters through any form of character development
","Antichrist is divided into four chapters, a prologue and epilogue. During the prologue a nameless couple, who are billed as He (Willem Dafoe) and She (Charlotte Gainsbourg), are having sex, leaving their baby son unattended. The baby climbs out of its cot, reaches a window and then falls to its death. Both of the parents grieve heavily for their son but it is She who is most affected, slipping deeper into depression. He, who is a therapist, disregards her doctor and the medication given to her. Instead He decides to take her to a cabin in the woodlands, a place called Eden, where She was last with their child, trying to finish her writing. He attempts to treat her himself with a number of psychological exercises, but there is something terribly ominous brewing inside Eden.",/review/rw5550304/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2021,Coffee_in_the_Clink,1," An awfully stupid and pretentious film
","""Antichrist"" lives up to its reputation for shock-value. But it is relentlessly boring, stupid and highly pretentious. I flinched, I screamed, I looked away, so kudos for that, but I came away feeling that the film was seriously gratuitous - shocking for the sake of it. Willem Dafoe feels wasted here as when he is not in the throes of passion or getting butchered and tortured he is left spewing uninteresting and repetitive dialogue. I could not wait for this to end, and that wasn't because of the extreme violence.",/review/rw5550304/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2009,dschmeding,4," Pretentious, boring ...
","Come on, why is everybody raving about this movie... the opening scene and some of the mysterious shots in the movie look nice but everything here was done before, even in cheap perfume adverts. The movie is so damn boring and the final scenes are so pseudo provocative I get why people walked out of the movie. When everyone is writing how shocking this movie is (and that just refers to 2 scenes I guess... funny how anything mixing sex and violence still shocks people... ) and you are served such a pretentious snooze fest no wonder people walk out before they fall asleep. You can interpret the movie in many ways, thats fine... BUT just dropping in religious and psychological references doesn't make a movie smart. I think the way that many react to criticism of this movie shows a lot of self-righteousness and snobby mentality of many Von trier fans. Whatever Mr. Trier was trying to say with this movie... I think he did it in a most unentertaining way. And after all you go to the movie to be entertained in whatever way but here you get endless artsy shots, no resolution whatsoever, characters I couldn't care less about (it was some kind of relief to see him strangle her to be honest), random sex scenes at times artsy at time dirty... what the hell? If you like interpreting the mix of genital mutilation, talking animals and mysterious shots of moving leaves... have a go, but don't tell people who find movies like this annoying that they are not smart enough. I'd rather watch paint dry.",/review/rw5550304/?ref_=tt_urv

","Down the road from me is a coven of Christian filmmakers. It is a school and the purpose is to make films that evangelize. This fascinates me; generally their stories are about fighting the devil, a narrative that encompasses both what is in the film and what surrounds the making of the film. Some day, they might make engaging films and who knows what will happen.",/review/rw5550304/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've always steered clear of Lars Von Trier's movies for fear of being bored rigid by an onslaught of pretentious, artsy-fartsy garbage, but I relented with Antichrist because I had heard it was an extremely harrowing experience full of very controversial and extremely unsettling imagery, all of which sounds just like my kind of thing.",/review/rw5550304/?ref_=tt_urv

","It is with some regret that I have decided to spend time reviewing Von Trier's 'Antichrist'. I am, by nature a curious film watcher, and will, at times, succumb to temptation and reserve a couple of hours to cast my own opinion, when a film creates ample controversy. Thus far my curiosity, across the spectrum has been met with, elation and disappointment in equal measure.",/review/rw5550304/?ref_=tt_urv

",Was there a point? Perhaps it's just a pointless film. Things happened in it. Things that could have happened. It's OK to have symbology but not at the expense of belief. This is obviously a very self indulgent film someone has made for some personal reason. That reason doesn't translate to the finished product.,/review/rw5550304/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2010,GloriousGooner,9," Unforgettable
","Within a complex tapestry of theology and symbolism Lars Von Trier's Antichrist plums the depths of the human condition taking cinema to places it has never gone nor ever wanted to go before. Following the establishing tragic accident (their son falls out of a window while they make love) He and She journey out to Eden, a remote lodge in the woods, for therapy where their lives and souls are changed forever. Far from a traditional horror film LVT gives us the darkest of psychological works that starts with shock before travelling down the spiral through grief, despair and panic ending in travesty. Gainsbourg and Defoe take us there, they carry the film on their monumental performances - Gainsbourg gives everything physically and emotionally to her role, while Defoe's character's grip on intellectualism is unrelenting. With death and depression permeating every frame of the film it has to be said that much of what is seen is stunningly beautiful - i really cant overstate the quality of the cinematography; at the same time the hauntingly evocative sound design adds that much needed 3rd dimension of pure evil that finishes off the work perfectly. It says and shows many disgusting things about humanity, but does so with such purity of vision, such artistic conviction that i found it totally irresistible. Not a film i'd want to see again in a hurry but certainly one i'm thankful i've experienced - it pushes the envelope in hitherto unforeseen ways that will probably affect film as a medium for years to come. If nothing else, i hope it helped LVT's recovery.",/review/rw5550304/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2012,Leofwine_draca,7," Gruelling cabin-in-the-woods horror
","Controversial, much lauded and horrific to watch, ANTICHRIST is Lars von Trier's showpiece film. It tells the tale of an unhappy marriage that breaks down due to grief, and the extremes that follow. It's a film that plays out as a two-hander for the most part, with Dafoe and Gainsbourg acting it up in a remote woodland cabin and taking out their rage and anger upon each other.",/review/rw5550304/?ref_=tt_urv

","First I have to make a comment to cynibun from United States who wrote ""And if you look at the previous reviewers they are from Denmark, where the director is from. Perhaps you have to be Danish to appreciate the horrific torture pornography, who knows??... Americans have more sense thankfully, and do not call everything art simply because the director is foreign."" I have no idea why it should matter where the other reviewers are from. That has nothing to do with ""Antichrist"" as a film. Some like it and some don't, no matter what country they are from. If I don't like an American film I don't go out and bash on reviewers from America and then state that Danes have more sense - what's that all about? Sense of what? Personally I don't think it makes much sense making movies like ""American Pie"" or ""Hannah Montana"", but hey, they produce the films anyway - maybe because they have more sense. Hannah Montana makes a LOT of sense... And you don't have to come from Denmark to like ""Antichrist"" (though it is a very constructive statement), I'm guessing there is one or two people from Russia or Poland who likes the film also...",/review/rw5550304/?ref_=tt_urv

","Following the death of their child, a therapist insists on helping his wife through her grief himself. She conceptualizes her anxiety as fear of the woods around their summer home and her husband, a proponent of hardcore exposure therapy, takes her there to face her fears. Once isolated at their cabin, however, her mental state rapidly deteriorates into acts of extreme physical and sexual violence. ",/review/rw5550304/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2020,classicsoncall,4," ""...what the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve.""
","So this is the third Lars von Trier film I've seen following 2000's ""Dancer in the Dark"" and 2003's ""Dogville"". Both pictures are pretty dense but ultimately have a story to tell and are quite compelling given the chance. ""Antichrist"" on the other hand, comes across as nothing less than sick, perverse and depraved, and those are some of the better adjectives I could find for it. It starts out well enough, focusing on a troubled couple who lose their young child in a home accident that could have been prevented, and it bothered me that 'She' (Charlotte Gainsbourg), in a thoughtful moment stated to 'He' (Willem Dafoe), that she should have warned him about Nic's (Storm Acheche Sahlstrøm) ability to climb out of the crib on his own. If so, then why leave the apartment window open as a harbinger of potential disaster? Later on in a bit of a flashback scene, there's even a hint that She might have watched complacently as Nic made his way to the window during a love making session with He, and did nothing to stop him. You would have to watch the film again to catch that nuance.",/review/rw5550304/?ref_=tt_urv
