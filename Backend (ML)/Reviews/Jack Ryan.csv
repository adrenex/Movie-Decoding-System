","Some people will have heard about this show because of its controversy. I did myself. Admittedly, I was intrigued because of the promise of sexual content on TV - HBO, nonetheless.

30 September 2007,blah2,9," Fantastic depiction of married life in all its broken splendor
","If you are uncomfortable about therapy, this show is not for you. The marriages depicted here are all broken - as 99% of relationships are - and they're broken enough that therapy is the only way to rescue them. The characters are interesting and deep, and their problems are realistic and almost scary in their accuracy. My favorite is the comments I've seen on some boards and even in HBO's little viewer comment section after each episode - when one of the reviewers said they couldn't imagine sex becoming annoying just because you have to have a lot of it to conceive, my wife and I laughed uproariously and yelled at the screen. Clearly some people just don't understand what it's like to be married! Fortunately, the writers of this show apparently do. There's good and bad, and sometimes you need help figuring out which is which. The show presents a fascinating view of modern marriage without any of the romantic crap and idealism that underlies most of TV today. Bravo, HBO! We're addicted.",/review/rw1743997/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2007,blanbrn,9," Provocative and visually explicit very frank in nature that brings raw emotions.
","""HBO's"" new adult only drama relationship series ""Tell Me You Love Me"" clearly is unlike anything before that was shown on TV even cable for that matter. A viewer can see this series explores relationships and sexuality to new heights showing the most sensitive matters in the most frank nature leaving the viewers to feel the raw emotions of the characters. Most for sure this is the series to watch if your concerned and interested in couples with sexual problems, pregnancy issues, commitment fears, masturbation, and passionate love making. The series focuses on two couples and one young female and the relationship problems they face are all guided along by a veteran and strong female Dr. May Foster(Jane Alexander) who despite her characters age has the healthiest sex life of all. The most and best likable couple is middle class and hard working Dave(Tim DeKay) and Katie(Ally Walker) both married for years and they have two children yet all of a sudden the action in the bedroom has stopped. Is it loss of sexual desire or personal lack of security? It's very interesting to watch this couple get counseled as you just feel like rooting for them to return to a normal and active life between the sheets. Second is the business and successful career orientated couple of Palek(Adam Scott) and Carolyn(Sonya Walger) who are happy and have a very active and passionate love and sex life, yet the one little problem is the couple can't get pregnant! The issue grows on each causing many stresses and mind changing feelings as Carolyn wants desperate to become a mother and Palek losses interest. Clearly a couple that sparkles yet you wonder if the difference of interest will let them last. Finally young girl Jamie(Michelle Borth) who has a commitment fear she just doesn't want to settle down after being hurt from a previous relationship, after each and every bed she hops in and out of it's more worry on finding the right one she even wonders to satisfy herself should she be celibate? Clearly a show that any adult can relate to all the above mentioned relationship problems no matter if married or not. It proves it's okay to receive therapy for complex issues. Again I must hand it to HBO it pushes the envelope again this series should be a lasting winner for the way it deals with adult relationship problems direct and in a frank manner it really grows on viewers emotions. A final word the performances of Ally Walker and Sonya Walger are worth mention, Ally is cool calm and strong in her role, while Sonya is just as sexy as ever while dealing with her struggles as a conflicted yet successful business lady.",/review/rw1743997/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2007,bondgirl6781,9," FINALLY! An Show About Relationships For Adults
","HBO has finally won me over after canceling Six Feet Under and Deadwood. ""Tell Me You Love Me"" is a one hour show on the lives of three women and their significant others: Meet Jaime (Michelle Borth), a young chef with commitment fears and trust issues. She has ended her engagement to Hugo and tries to move on with her life. Now meet, Katie (Ally Walker, who is amazing) and Dave (Tim DeKay), a suburban married couple with two children and the passion has run out of their marriage. And then there is Carolyn and Palek, a yuppie married couple with no children and plenty of passion in their marriage and trying to have a baby. In fact, Carolyn (Sonya Walger) obsesses about getting pregnant to the point that Palek (Adam Scott) is now doubtful of his ability to be good husband and a good father. The show is very graphic in sexuality, but that is the point. It is often times painful to watch because (for myself especially) there are moments in the show that you can actually relate. From the desperation of bringing passion, joy, and fulfillment into the lives of our characters to emptiness and loneliness they feel. It is heartbreaking to see Katie and Dave become so faraway when they do love each other still. What these people have in common? They are seeing therapist, Dr. May Foster (the formidable and incredible Jane Alexander), who has issues of her own with her long time marriage to her husband but still is adult enough and knows better. The show is honest, raw, and real with amazing performances from the cast. Truly the best dramatic series HBO has put out.",/review/rw1743997/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2007,Quinoa1984,5," naturalism meets Cinemax late night programming. nice try, but it's too shallow and contrived
","I really did want to try to get into Tell Me You Love Me. It seemed like the answer to many a false-noted romantic drama on TV, certainly for soap operas. If anything though it's the total 180 of a soap- it's meant to be too realistic, but without a sense of humor to it that a weepy melodrama might dish out every now and again. In the bulk of the series I've seen so far (of the first season) I can't remember even chuckling once- yes, even with the one guy and his sometimes dipping into, color us shocked, middle aged masturbation- and while there's attempts made to get deeper into the psychology of the characters it's hard to ever really care about what any of them do.

1 September 2009,chrisliz57,8," Does any of this ring a bell?
","You see, many couples in Australia would never dream of seeing a therapist. The mere stigma of owning up to issues, issues most couples experience, is just too confronting. The worry that friends or family might find out may lead too more sleepless nights, a more important consequence than the actual saving of the marriage. Well in the privacy of ones own home comes ""Tell Me You Love Me"". A riveting drama more akin to a self - help DVD. We meet a therapist confronting her own problems, deal with the contrasting issues of three couples. The clever positioning of the drama is that the ages of each couple ranges from early 20's to early sixties (the therapist and her past) and the challenges faced by each reflect their stage of life. Sex becomes the key to the healing for each partnership. The sex scenes are explicit and may be confronting but that adds to the spice of the series. The sex experienced by all of the characters helps them to reveal where they are at emotionally. The therapist encourages sexual communication for all her clients but under prescription,and each of her prescriptions are modeled with precision. An important piece of television ...... if you have a partner, sit and watch this together. If the themes bring fresh thoughts and dialogue in your union then maybe you've saved two things. Therapist fees not covered by Medicare or maybe, but more importantly, your relationship.",/review/rw1743997/?ref_=tt_urv

23 March 2008,monsterflick,2," The Joylessness of Sex
","Written and directed by two women who apparently don't have a clue about sexuality (especially male sexuality), this embarrassing attempt at erotic honesty is neither erotic nor honest. It all comes off like a bad Lifetime TV movie, with clich√©d situations, terrible dialogue, and some of the lamest sex scenes I've ever seen. Which is a shame, because the premise has great potential and the subject deserves better. I realize a lot of people have trouble talking about sex, but focusing on inarticulate, stifled characters makes for bad TV. Why don't these people talk? I mean, REALLY TALK about sex? The series' creators are obviously afraid to get down and dirty, to dive into the nitty-gritty details of all-too-common issues like monogamy, masturbation, menstruation, orgasms, the differences between male and female sexuality, etc. Instead of honesty, depth or insight, they give us unconvincing tidbits of pathetic pop psychology straight out of ""Oprah."" For a show about human sexuality, it feels awfully uptight, politely politicized, and downright Victorian. I think they could have used a male writer to balance out the feminized perspective, or simply had the balls to address their subjects head-on. (No pun intended.) As for the sex scenes, I can't help but wonder if the actors have ever actually had sex before. It's that awkward and stiff. (Again, no pun intended.) All in all, this series is a big disappointment: simplistic, boring, and a missed opportunity to address America's complex love-shame relationship with sex.",/review/rw1743997/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2007,yuichi1989,8," character development at it's finest
","I've watched the first two episodes of this series and I truly enjoyed it, and not for the explicit scenes. The drastically different couples all have very deep character profiles that seem to parallel in unexpected ways. If you can look below the surface of being a ""glorified porno"" like jrpk1964 thinks it is, the true intentions of the show will become apparent. To portray the lives of these couples each with unique situations that all seem to share commonalities which you can relate to. ",/review/rw1743997/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2015,bjarias,8," ..this is one that should not have ended
","Guess some comments might be spoilers. Couple one.. he unquestionably loves her, and she does him. But she is an unabashed serial cheater that has had numerous sexual relationships, and has never by her own admission been monogamous in any of them, even with her now current fianc√©e. So she gets married and all that's immediately going to change.. and she's already talking to him about what if I f--k up again? Next couple.. she's been pregnant twice now and has had both go away for different reasons... so she definitely can and very seriously wants to get pregnant. But he adamantly does not want to have any kids. So really, where are they logically heading. And the last couple has discovered some form of sex again. Wither it will lead them to doing 'it' together after such a long absence is quite another matter. Their 'other-dreams' have still not changed, and she'll now be going back out into the workforce coming into contact with loads of other men. So two out of three are definitely on very shaky ground...just like the real world. It's really too bad they stopped this series after one season, it hardly got going and should have had more time. It was so well cast, written, and acted. It's very disappointing it all ended so soon.",/review/rw1743997/?ref_=tt_urv

","I like this a lot. Very new pace, daring way to go about telling stories. I am a big fan of this style,I think it is riveting and relevant to life, just my kind of thing. God I love to see sex that seems somewhat real. Good writing, true, insightful, fresh. GREAT ACTING!!! Ally Walker is brilliant, had these moment where I just sat with my mouth open, I knew exactly the inexpressible conflicting place she was at. All the choices were subtle, very right, exactly catching the moments of marriage and the pain. The pilot also was brilliantly directed, so quirky and confident. Not surprising coming from a woman who directed ""I Heard the Mermaids Singing"" Bravo Patricia! It is a show that seems to cash in on honest and patient Canadian integrity while remaining thoroughly entertaining. Note, give it more than 10 minutes before you decide it's not for you. Hope it manages to last- it is a bit risky, not what we're used to. Also, I'm not sure it will appeal to everyone, a little worrisome that I like it so much but I also am a big fan of Six Feet Under, Gray's Anatomy, House and Entourage (but I also liked John from Cincinatti) so who knows?",/review/rw1743997/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's not surprising that IMDb readers are treated to a few too many impressions of those who watch lots and lots of television. So reviews defining HBO's most recent attempt at ""breaking new ground"" with ""character development at it's finest"", and offering lectures on our ""sad"" puritanical and unsophisticated ideas about sex, come as no big surprise from these Sunday night connoisseurs of the fine art of television. Apparently sex between septuagenarians IS beautiful and if you don't think so, you're not just sad but very, very sad. (and it's probably George W. Bush's fault -- in fact you probably voted for him).",/review/rw1743997/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2022,nitestar95,4," Women disappointed that their prince turned out to be just an ordinary guy
","Like many other relationship shows and movies, the sex is perpetuated to be adequate when it lasts only a minute or two; no wonder this is why men believe that's all women ever want or need. Women grow up being told that they are princesses, and should wait for their prince to come, sweep them off their feet, and provide them with a wonderful life and remain faithful to them forever, and always make them feel adored and special. Never are they able to understand or accept that what they want out of the relationship is different from what men want. What does he get? He gets to spend his life working and if he's lucky, have sex when she deems to let him. Basically, just more tales about how women are disappointed in the men in their lives due to great, and unrealistic expectations.",/review/rw1743997/?ref_=tt_urv

The sex is really tame and unimaginative, but I appreciate the therapy sessions with Dr. May Foster, who is played by the great Jane Alexander, in a role she is perfectly suited for. Very believable, although for the most part they too (the sessions) have been a tad on the tame side thus far.",/review/rw1743997/?ref_=tt_urv

13 October 2007,cheddercaveman,9," Great Drama
","I think that this is a great show. It gets into the relationships closer and it shows more realistic life experiences. The sex scenes are not pornographic but are realistic I think. The ups and downs that everyone goes through are amazing. Also, I'd just like to point out that someone made a comment attacking the show or the woman on the show because of how shaved the girls are, and I felt that I wanted to defend that. I don't know what part of life you are currently in, but THAT is NOT just for porn, real people are like that. I've not seen a woman under the age of 30 who does not look similar to either Jamie or Caroline. However, I digress. I suggest that this is a great drama for someone who wants to take some of the clich√© out of the typical Hollywood type stuff.",/review/rw1743997/?ref_=tt_urv

","I can't stand people like this in real life. Why would I want to watch them on TV? The pace is glacial. The colors are completely washed out. The characters are all unlikable to one degree or another. Everyone is moderately well-off and, aside from the one instance of infertility, their problems are all about their vague dissatisfaction with their existences. In short, this show is one long whine. Remember when they made the Brady bunch into a drama? Okay, take that same template, but use Seinfeld as the model. The characters remain unlikable, but all the humor has been removed? Okay, now have Elaine get naked every once in a while, but occasionally throw in scenes of George's parents having sex just to throw off the casual channel surfers. Now take what you have and make it really WASPy. There. You're done. You've just created HBO's latest crime against its subscribers: ""Tell Me You Love Me"".",/review/rw1743997/?ref_=tt_urv

20 September 2007,cecileussel,," just like a french movie!
","And I'm French... Who wanna see ""realistic"" sex and relationships problems on screen when you can have lots (and lots, and lots) of them in your real life? Like in a french movie, nobody seems to have (or to need) a job or to care about anything else than their little and meaningless lives. Furthermore, in real life, relationships and sex are directly related to money and job problems and to your social background. Nothing is said in the show about the social aspects of relationships - of course, because otherwise it would never air because it would be truly disturbing. Showing explicit sex (or explicit violence) is always a cheap way for people to pretend that they are ""open mind"" and ""liberal"" (like some famous editor of adult content magazines who manages to make everybody forget he's just a pimp). We sure know that in France where 70% of the movies are just soft porn with bad lightening (well, not exactly: the characters have some books in their homes so you can tell you're seeing a ""real"" movie).",/review/rw1743997/?ref_=tt_urv
