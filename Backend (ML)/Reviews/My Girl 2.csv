16 February 2018,wildsparrow16,10," Stellar performances by everyone....pulse-pounding....
","Every actor in this is incredible. The resemblance of Koresh to Kitsch is uncanny, even the voice. This man has many movies in his future, his acting is superb and the screen loves him. This movie seems pretty accurate so far, and it really delves into the human side of every single person involved. It is almost if there are multiple protagonists - the children, Koresh, the FBI negotiator who clearly wanted to end this with no violence, and the lost souls whom we only slowly get to know. There are no dull moments. I am loving this series so far....",/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2018,kenstallings-65346,10," An historically faithful telling!
","With a complex and still controversial real life event like the standoff and assault of the Branch Davidian compound at Mount Carmel, it is vital that the producers respect history. Having seen five of the planned six episodes, it seems safe now to say that the producers have worked very hard to portray an historically fair and accurate narrative.",/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2020,AnneWLKR,," Corrects bogus portrayals praising the ATF
","This relies on extensive book info from former Mt Carmel resident David Thibodeau and the FBI negotiator, Gary Noesner, who had arranged the agreement by Koresh In the final days of the siege to surrender.",/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2020,DVK1234,8," Biased
","I remember Waco and the tragedy of how many lives were lost. Watching this series, it struck how anti-government the bias was. They portrayed David Koresh as quite ""normal"", as far as cult leaders go. In doing some research on Waco now, you hear clips of him screaming at his congregation, calling them stupid idiots. He slept with the senior citizen who was running the compound in a power play to take over Mt Carmel instead of it being left to her son. He had sex and married children as young as 11 years old. They portrayed the group as a lovely bunch. That's not how it was. There was systemic abuse in Waco, and many of the followers were also guilty of that. The ATF were called in because there were reports of grenades being delivered to the compound, and semi-automatic weapons being changed into automatic weapons without proper approval by the government. Koresh was a classic sociopath. He cared about his needs, and he loved the power. They did not portray that in the series well.",/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2018,rklemm05,8," Great show, I wish I knew how truthful it really is
","I read a few reviews of this series, and some people seem to say that the facts have been accurately portrayed. If so, not only were ATF and FBI irresponsible, but also erratic, spiteful, deplorable on every step and angle.",/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2018,smitten94,10," Best mini - series on waco tragedy yet
","Some don't agree with the facts of this series but it is based on the books of 1 of the survivors ALONG WITH the book of the FBI negotiator who were BOTH on scene as advisors for the series. So with that said, this is THEIR story to tell and I'm glad they took the time to tell it together. ",/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2020,fmwongmd,7," Exceptional
","A worthy and exceptional film about our FBI and bureau of ATF with excellent portrayals by Taylor Kitsch, Michael Shannon, Paul Sparks and David Thibodeaux.",/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2018,josephdrew-14623,9," AMAZINGLY GRAVITATING!
","All I can say is WOW. Michael Shannon and Taylor Kitsch are incredible in their roles as an FBI agent and cult leader. Although you don't want to root for Kitsch's character, you can't help but be drawn in by his outstanding deliverance from David's vision of the bible. Michael Shannon portrays his character in an exact delivery on an apposite side of what David believed, but has a severe sense of conflict with the FBI that he shows in his alone time.",/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2018,gowdey,10," Great cast
","Good dialogue, acting is top notch. I was shocked at how many known faces from some of my favorite shows are a part of this series. Don't get caught up in the politics or what you believe happened that day or you're going to miss out. It's not a documentary.",/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2018,rukstar69,8," Excellent!
","I must admit, I knew very a little about this Waco incident before seeing this. This story really points to the ATF and FBI really being the bad guys well more bullies than bad guys. I dunno how much is true but it certainly seems that way based on this portrayal. I was hooked from the start, The acting is amazing and so it the screen play. There are 6 episodes all an hour each and the felt like 5 mins each. I would recommend this mini-series to anyone.",/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2020,IonicBreezeMachine,7," It's well done on a technical and acting level, but it also bends over itself as an apologist piece for Randy Weaver and David Koresh
","Waco as a miniseries is competently made and filled with tension. The show follows the ATF/FBI standoff with the Branch Dividians that led to the deaths of the majority of the cult members and years of investigations and inquiries into the actions of the ATF. Taking its sources from two books, A Place Called Waco by David Thibodeau & Leon Whiteson and Stalling for Time: My Life as an FBI Hostage Negotiator by Gary Noesner, the series gives us a holistic view at the event from both sides of the engagement. Gary Noesner is played very well by Michael Shannon and conveys his desperation to deescalate the tensions while fighting against both Koresh's ego and the HRT team's desire to use aggressive actions to bring about a decisive end. It's a really good performance and only serves to reinforce what a fantastic actor Shannon is. Taylor Kitsch is equally good as Branch Dividians leader David Koresh and brings out the charisma of the man and from the performance you can understand why his followers would be drawn to him.",/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2020,acedj,8," Interesting, to say the least
","For anyone that was not alive in 1993, or living under a rock, this miniseries takes a look, from all sides, at the standoff in Waco Texas, led by the FBI and ATF versus one David Koresh. Fearing the amount of guns being hoarded at the retreat occupied by the religious group, the ATF tries to serve a warrant that turns into a firefight and a 51 day stand-off.",/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2022,slak96u,8," A National Tragedy
","The amount of speculation in this mini series is alarming. But, it would be impossible to tell this story without at least some bias. This show, without a doubt is skewed to look favorable on Koresh, a known child predator. A man surrounded by devotees that allowed his disgusting and vile treatment of girls.",/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2020,cathysparta,3," Very inaccurate
","I am sure from all I have read about the actual events, that the ATF made a mess of this but, Koresh was a child molesting monster. The movie idiolizes this crazy cult which brutalized women as young as 11.",/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2018,JodyKibler,4," Parts are pure fantasy
","The story told of the FBI and ATF appears to very accurate. The story of David Koresh is a work of fantasy. They have romanticized the Branch Davidian. They made it look like David is taking one for the team being the only one having intimate relations they have left off the stories of abuse. These facts are not created by the government, this was reports from witnesses inside the compound. Kids that were allowed to leave. I am very suspicious of creators that only tell a story from one side.",/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2020,brandonneicke,8," Good tv show
","Was a good tv show and even a fairly solid layout of what actually happened with great acting with it. Taylor did an amazing job playing David, anyone who finished watching the show and felt sorry for David in ways or even thought he wasn't that bad of a guy just shows how good cult leaders are. They are good at brainwashing people. However David is a terrible person and I think by episode 8 they should have showcased that a bit more. I mean the guy slept with 12 year olds so he's actually a Phedopile and at no point was that word mentioned. The downside is people Who don't know the real story will Rely on this tv show as the facts. If all you saw was the tv show you might actually think David was in the right and the fbi were in the wrong. I feel sorry for no one that died except the kids",/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2019,Gabbiadini,10," Wow!
",An absolute gem of a mini series with fantastic acting from all involved . Taylor was amazingly convincing and has proved himself as a true leading man in this heartbreaking drama,/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2020,vincent-93104,1," NOT Accurate
",Please watch the corresponding documentary Messiah or Madman which is based on all first hand accounts from BOTH sides and you will see how Netflix twisted the facts and blatantly lied to push their narrative. This is pure propaganda.,/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2018,ConsDemo,7," Gripping but some concerns about accuracy
","It has been a quarter of a century but I still remember this event well and especially the fall out after words. It's a gripping series although others have raised concerns about it's accuracy. Anyone who paid attention to this event knows that the Branch Davidians were a cult and were accused of some serious crimes such as child abuse. The FBI was accused of recklessness in their assault of the cult's compound. This series will give credence to both points of view. At times, the Branch Davidians come across as harmless and close knit and David Koresh at time seems wise and kind. However, even if the series doesn't show most serious allegations against the group, it suggests Koresh was guilty of polygamy and statutory rape, which was enough to merit the attention of the authorities.",/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2018,shcirrone,5," What about Byron Sage?!?!
","I really enjoyed this series. I think it gave a more sympathetic and detailed view of the Branch Davidians. But how is Gary Noesner getting away with inserting himself in the position it seems clear Byron Sage occupied. Many of the conversations purported to have gone on between Noesner and Koresh are conversations the world has already heard happen between SAGE and Koresh. Not Noesner. So while I did enjoy the acting and the story. It seemed to be a more fair example of the Davidians than that showed by other media, but very disappointing that Noesner clearly pretends to have done things he did not do. I have followed and watched many shows about Waco in the last 25 years and this series is the very first time I ever even heard of Noesner. And it's a fact that he was NOT at Waco for the whole 51 days of the siege. He was replaced by Clint Van Sandt after a few weeks. Very disappointing. And I wonder what Byron Sage thinks about it",/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2020,blancejr-45573,2," Great acting, but very misleading!
","I'm not sure what the motivation for portraying Koresh as a humble, understanding, all around good guy was. It's pretty disturbing that they would put this out there and give people the impression that it's factual. Koresh was a very mentally disturbed, narcissistic, evil person. That is a stone cold fact. He beat children as young as 8 months old, raped young girls and impregnated them, forced men to let him sleep with their wives. The scene where he catches the kid sneaking ice cream would've gone a lot differently in real life. He'd have beaten that kid mercilessly and forced him to sleep outside. He also provoked the fight with the ATF and FBI waaay more than is depicted in the show. He wanted a fight. In the end he lit children on fire because of his massive ego. Don't get me wrong, the FBI and ATF really screwed the pooch too, but to portray Koresh as an innocent victim just trying to live peacefully is a joke! The man was pure evil and just as, if not more, responsible for the deaths at the Waco compound as the US Government. After 3 episodes you can see it's anti government propaganda if you know the real story behind Koresh. Again, the government is not innocent by any stretch, but the story is ridiculously one sided. Great acting though.",/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2020,LightningB,3," Well that wasn't slanted at all
",The FBI and ATF made so many mistakes it could be comical if it wasn't in regards to such as serious matter. But this series paints every fed agent as a warmonger outside of Gary Noessner (Michael Shannon) and paints Koresh as overall a pretty good guy. The truth is he wasn't. Not even close. Facts about him are not in disupte. He fathered children with multiple women including underage girls. He believed he was the 2nd coming on Christ. But this series barely touches the surface on those topics and instead paints him as quite a sympathetic figure. Not sure why the creators of this show decided to go that way. What a missed mark that was. Did they not think we don't already know or can't find out what Koresh was? I still give 4 stars because of the actors. I would wager most of the 9 and 10 star ratings are people not even alive or are too young to remember this event firsthand. Koresh was\is nothing to sympathize with.,/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2018,shirejlj,3," Stellar performances but irresponsible representation of actual events...
","No one will ever know what really happened as those inside the compound are now dead, but I was shocked at the irresponsible story-telling, especially when we have a large population that considers a mini-series a worthy source of fact and take it as such.",/review/rw4079223/?ref_=tt_urv
