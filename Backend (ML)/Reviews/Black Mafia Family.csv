20 May 2004,anhedonia,," One of the best shows on TV
","The show's clever, the dialogue smart, the characters engaging and the the occasional veering into the absurd and outrageous provides a refreshing break from TV fare that is generally tepid at best these days.",/review/rw6640753/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2004,BlackX,," Brilliant. Why does Friends get the huge fan base and the overexposure and not this?

3 March 2022,Bored_Dragon,10," ""A person doesn't have to be perfect to be exactly what you need."" TV show too.
","In a sea of hospital (melo)dramas that take themselves too seriously, even though their quality is questionable, Bill Lawrence created something different, a hilarious sitcom that takes the best of both genres, placing the ""Friends"" type of sitcom in a hospital setting. ""Scrubs"" is a sitcom, with all the features of sitcoms, but it is much more than that.",/review/rw6640753/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2003,Jozxyqk,7," Great Show
","It's nice to see a show on these days that can actually make me laugh and doesn't use a truck load of toilet humour. The flashes to an inner world in Newbies mind are always fascinating and sometimes funny. Dr Cox is SO funny as is the Janitor. But what really strengthened my love for this show was the episode 'My Philosophy'. It was the first time in ages a TV show made me cry. I LOVE that ending. Great acting, humorous and a lesson learned at the end of each episode is icing on the cake. This is definately not your average show.",/review/rw6640753/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2004,Springie,10," So good, just so good...
","I always thought that Scrubs is a great TV show, not only for the great acting and the funny scripts, but also for showing what working in a hospital is really like. Every doctor will say that ""life is not like ER"", and scrubs didn't take the whole heroic position and the action-drama scenes, that frankly, is much less common in hospitals than an old man with diarrhea, reflux, colitis or other not so very ""photographic"" diseases.",/review/rw6640753/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2006,mafster,8," A real shock...
","I was very surprised to like this comedy. I am one who does not like American humour but I love this. It reminds me of a TV 'Dramedy' we have over in the UK called teachers. The characters are consistent throughout the three seasons that I have viewed and very enjoyable. To be honest, I didn't get on with it at first but given time, I'm glad I gave it an extra chance to prove itself.",/review/rw6640753/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2020,pcampionz,10," Can't believe this show came out so long ago
","Flicking around the Roku channels and I was able to start watching these from the pilot episode. This has to be one of the best sitcoms ever on television. The chemistry with all of the actors is definitely off the hook. Now that we know the actors it's a bit hard to imagine anyone else playing any of them. The bond between Zack and Turk is on par with Richie and Fonzie. And the janitor character really adds to the comedy, can't imagine the janitor not being in the series. Highly recommended",/review/rw6640753/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2004,jakebd,," Not actually a sitcom...
","Let me start off by saying that I adore this show. Really, I'm absolutely enthralled by it. Here's the thing, it's not really a sitcom. If you're a fan of straight zannyness and a brand new plot with each episode, this isn't really the show for you. ",/review/rw6640753/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2019,markq-75654,9," I'm no Superman
","I've watched through this show so many countless times. And every time it's great, it makes laugh and feel the emotions of the characters. This shows deals great with the characters and their jobs. It shows how hard it is being a doctor and a death of a patient effects them. Such as season 1 episode 4 and season 8 episode 2. Episodes that show our characters connecting to their patients.
But Scrubs can also give us over the top Hilarious moments. Like JD's day dreams and the stuff Turk and JD get into. All in all this show is not your typical comedy/drama show. It's a great deep series that offers so much.",/review/rw6640753/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2021,malcolmjohnston,9," Twenty years late to the party !!
","After getting extremely bored of the current new releases on my streaming services I decided to give Scrubs a try 20 years after it first aired and up till last week I'd never seen a minute of this show
Well I'm late to the party and boy am I glad I finally found it
I'm already through 2 & a bit seasons and I'm still roaring with laughter at the cartoonish nature and over the top clips on the smallest of points",/review/rw6640753/?ref_=tt_urv

29 July 2006,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,9," A pure definition of must-see TV!
","""SCRUBS,"" in my opinion, is a pure definition of must-see TV! Despite the fact that I've never seen every episode, I still enjoy it. My favorite one would have to be either the one that was filmed before a live studio audience or the one where Michael J. Fox guest-stars. You'll have to have seen them for yourself if you want to know why. Oh, and by the way, I especially love the theme song. Everyone always gives a good performance, the production design is spectacular, the costumes are well-designed, and the writing is always very strong. Before I wrap this up, I hope that all you die-hard fans of the show will always have it live on in syndication. In conclusion, if it becomes syndicated after it finishes its run on NBC, I strongly recommend you catch it before it goes off the air for good.",/review/rw6640753/?ref_=tt_urv

13 November 2011,kosmasp,8," Revived for a ninth season
","And that is one of its biggest downfalls. It never should have gotten this ninth season. Even if people (or producers or both) demanded it. The 8th season would have been a great ending to it all. And while the ninth feels more like a spin off (fresh faces, that might have faired better if added a couple of seasons earlier), it almost revived the show entirely. Still quite a few story lines got repeated towards the end (with even one episode completely reminiscing on old clips). There is also a ""comeback"" of a character that did not sit well with me (and apparently other viewers too, because the character had only a few appearances), for no good reason at all.",/review/rw6640753/?ref_=tt_urv

He falls for the bumbling Dr. Elliot Reid (Sarah Chalke), makes an enemy of The Janitor (Neil Flynn), is helped by nurse Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes), and worships the supervising Dr Perry Cox (John C.
