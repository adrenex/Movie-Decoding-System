","This was a really good show and I honestly know that because I'm watching it (again btw) nine years after it was on tv and it's STILL engaging! Great chemistry between characters, good story line and really good banter. It's a shame with some of the crap on today. This was definitely worth watching.",/review/rw5895211/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2012,omars1123,10," Captivating show!!
","Breakout Kings has to be one of the most well-written shows in past years. The depth of each character is played out with flawless precision. I was a bit skeptical of the show at first, but once I started watching, there was no turning back. Each episode is purely original without any repeating plot structure. Being someone with an interest in neuroscience and psychology, I find the concept of appointing Cons to catch Cons extremely intriguing. Add on the psychological expertise of one of the team members, it becomes gripping to delve into the minds of not only escaped cons, but convicts in general. ",/review/rw5895211/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2011,faithofculda,10," Actually, It's Really Good
","Breakout Kings is the show that i've been waiting for a long time. I enjoyed the prison break, first two seasons at least. And my expectations weren't that much from BK because before the show starts, i knew there's going to be a show like Prison Break but without constantly going story, after and after episodes waiting to resolve some points about whats going on and what will happen. That's why i like BK so much. ",/review/rw5895211/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2011,ariannafelidae-1,9," Totally worth it.
","The more I see of this show, the more I like it. The characters are each individual (meaning well-written and acted personalities) with diverse backgrounds and issues all their own. One of the hooks (I believe) is that each member of the team is a black sheep in some way...finding out what each of them have done (or can't do?) is probably what will keep most people watching. The actors have a wonderful chemistry, as well! ",/review/rw5895211/?ref_=tt_urv

4 July 2016,mccabe1965,4," I can see why it got cancelled
","The whole first season, no one wore bulletproof vests. The plots were weak, the story lines were unbelievable. they portrayed prison guards as disrespectful and at times abusive towards prisoners. Top notch team. One was an academy washout. One lived in a halfway house, one had a serious heart problem and three were Convicts.",/review/rw5895211/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2019,chishaacem,10," Why was this show cancelled?
","This show deserved atleast 5 seasons. The storyline was well written, each episode had its own plot with a main plot developing throughout. What's not fun about cons catching cons. It baffles me how shows like this get canned while mindless dross is left on for years. Netflix should have picked this up",/review/rw5895211/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2013,SnoopyStyle,7," US Marshall gets cons to track cons
","Deputy U. S. Marshal Charlie Duchamp leads an experimental program recruiting convicts with special skills to track down criminals on the run. He is killed to start the second season. Former Marshall Ray Zancanelli is revealed to have a criminal past and given the chance to take over after Duchamp's death.

22 May 2011,ria_j_phantom,10," Best show of 2011
","IT TAKES A CON TO CATCH A CON - Driven by the fact that there are few things more dangerous than a prisoner who has just escaped, and tired of following protocol and resorting to outdated methods of law enforcement, veteran U.S. Marshals Charlie Duchamp (Laz Alonso) and Ray Zancanelli (Domenick Lombardozzi) are taking an unorthodox approach to their work: using former fugitives (Jimmi Simpson, Malcolm Goodwin & Serinda Swan) to catch fugitives. ""Breakout Kings"" follows U.S. Marshals Charlie Duchamp (Laz Alonso) and Ray Zancanelli (Domenick Lombardozzi) as they form a special task force composed of the three most elusive convicts Ray ever captured: Lloyd Lowery (Jimmi Simpson), a former child prodigy and behaviorist/psychiatric expert whoexcels in psychoanalysis; Shea Daniels (Malcolm Goodwin), an ex-gangbanger who knows how to work the system, both in prison and on the street; and Erica Reed (Serinda Swan), a sexy expert tracker who learned her trade from her bounty hunter father. Charlie and Ray also employ the services of Julianne Simms (Brooke Nevin), a civilian who acts as the ""funnel"" for the group – all information, tips and data go through her.",/review/rw5895211/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2011,han_crazy,9," Should definitely watch this!
","There is virtually nothing wrong with this program. The cons are likable the story lines aren't recycled and the idea is creative, it's not predictable. The relationship between characters helps you connect easily, even the Marshall's have a story that in some way makes them less boring and all for the rules. Makes them as interesting as the cons who come across well, they are treated as they are suppose to as they are violent, they are real criminals they aren't in prison for petty crimes. Which makes the whole story more interesting to watch and intriguing when it gets down to what they will do. Overall it has the right amount of humour for this kind of program and the right amount of action and suspense not to make the story boring and repetitive.",/review/rw5895211/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2014,s-alba,7," Better then expected and action packed from the get go
","Its one of those series that once you start watching it, you find yourself watching episode after episode. From the start of each episode the action starts at the off set. Fully loaded you are sure to enjoy each episode from start to finish. Brilliantly written!! Good characters and very good actors. I call breakout kings the show stopper. This is due to the fact that i have stopped watching all my other series at the moment to continue watching this hence calling it the show stopper.. prison three brings T Bag back to life. T Bag is a character from Prison Break, which i might add that if you liked prison break then breakout kings is definitely the new series for you.. I have nearly finished the first season and cant wait for the second season.. Netflix is the place to find all the episodes. Enjoy",/review/rw5895211/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2011,ms-keegan-lee,5," It's got potential
",The premise of the show alone compelled me to watch it. I like the cons and find the profiler very entertaining. But the Domenick Lombardozzi character has to be softened up or written out - there is virtually nothing likable about the guy. The leader of the outfit has been given the most predictable lines of anyone and he's an almost totally useless character. They treat the cons like sh#t while asking for their help - I would think there'd be a little more compassion for them considering none of them are in for violent crimes. The US gov't has long acquired crooks to better their work force...and it's not a bad notion. This show could be developed into something a lot more than just crushing the cons and expecting the audience to feel good about it. A good premise...bad writing and mis-casting.,/review/rw5895211/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2011,hawkeye-82,10," Great!
","A great drama show. The characters are fully loaded with emotional problems and they will go far more to deal with it. It's an important aspect for this kind of drama, cause there's also a presence of action. I'm very inspired with it, so hardly wait for next episodes. I think PB producers will show us more and I believe it will be one of the best shows =) I think, that Lloyd will have to deal with something romantic between him and assistant girl. Very interesting character, Ph.D, it's so weird for the con. Shea has some sort of motivation, but I really don't understand what kind of it) Cause I think he's not like C-Note in PB, and his girl wouldn't wait him for so long, because he really looks too criminal. Philly is aт enigma for now, I really don't understand her behavior, but trailer said, that she will try to screw Ray in a while, let's just see what it will look like) Ray is great, but, he's too soft for his character representation, dunno. The head guy is just usual, don't think, that he has any issues..",/review/rw5895211/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2014,geordiesdad,3," If mindless violence with no plot is your choice...here it is.
","I had the dubious pleasure of having been given the complete series of this show and from the very first episode it felt as if it were computer designed. Start with the never-smiling black leader who, naturally has a major chink in his armor. Next are a bevy of ladies...tough, yet sensitive...capable of beating up fellow team members if necessary yet also capable of cuddling a list puppy.....GAG!!! Of course we have to have an overweight wannabee tough guy with a soft heart...and a criminal history as well. Naturally we needed a genius/nerd and there he is...I.Q. 200+..unlikely since he mispronounces at least a half dozen words in episode 1 alone. The plots as well are of the typical vanilla-computer-generated variety showing absolutely NO imagination at all. Was this TRULY a computer-generated series?? Gagging my way through series 1 I then felt I was only capable of keeping down my supper if I only 'sampled' the other seasons....but it made no difference....like cookies from a factory each and every episode was a thinly disguised clone of it's brother....cousin...uncle... If you are an attention deficit sufferer then there MIGHT be some excuse for watching this....at 42 minutes it's neither fish nor fowl. There are 2 other GOOD reasons for watching it....an I.Q. or an age in the 1 digit group....otherwise....as an intelligent HUMAN.....pass it by.",/review/rw5895211/?ref_=tt_urv

15 May 2011,ga_brandsen,9," Surprisingly Great!!!!!
","I was very shocked how good this show has become. At first it was a little shaky for the first few episodes, but it has become way more solid!!! Each episode is so creative and unique. This show has endless options on were to go!! It starts out with these cons who are catching these crazy people who escape from prison. It is weird, because even though these cons who help catch these prisoners who escape, have done some pretty awful things, you really learn to love them and get to them for who they are. The stuff they did is bad, but nothing compared to the convicts that they are attempting to catch. I think this show really keeps you at the edge of your seat. Especially since the ""good"" cons and the ""u.s. marshals"", are not that much different. I really think you should give this show a shot!",/review/rw5895211/?ref_=tt_urv

","Breakout kings managed to have me hooked 20 minutes in the pilot.a team of cops & with secrets.the bickering between the kings is one of the best parts of the show along with great character development.the cops r looking to prove themselves the cons are trying to shorten their sentences & must put up with each other to capture prison escapees such as - spoiler alert........-A a female crimeboss who killed her son,a prisoner who was raped in prison hell bent on revenge,an honest family man who collects & tortures women in his spare time & prisonbreaks Theodore t-bag bagwell.this show is addictive fun suspenseful & hilarious my my favorite show of 2011.season 2 premieres march 4th 2012",/review/rw5895211/?ref_=tt_urv

","You need a criminal to catch a criminal - It sounds good? Well, I have watched many criminal, action TV series, and I must say this one isn't up to it's level, because the idea of criminal cons catching the ones who escaped from jail is pretty awesome. ",/review/rw5895211/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2012,innocuous,3," If the first five episodes are anything to go by....
","Who is watching this series and giving it 7+ ratings? I gave up over 4 hours of my life to watch the first five episodes and this is terrible. It's boring, contrived (of course), and silly. I don't like any of the characters...no, let me rephrase that. I don't CARE about any of the characters. Go back to jail, get shot, save somebody's life...I don't care. All the police are total idiots. (""Wait. We had to release someone from prison in order to learn that we should contact the escapee's past associates? Why didn't they tell us that in US Marshal's school?"") ",/review/rw5895211/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2011,rom_6,7," good with a few plot holes
","so far the show looks good , but it has a few plot holes as the person who breaks out from prison always have a crime to commit or something bad to do when he's out .. no one escapes to be free or without motive to do something bad .. also i think that no case ever solved in more than one episode makes it a little boring after maybe 10 episodes .. bottom line that it's a good show but if you are going to compare it with prison break it will be a huge step back unless something new comes up. but if you consider it as a new idea away from prison break it's actually very creative to use cons to help finding who ever escaped from prisons .",/review/rw5895211/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2020,jbencker,8," Entertaining as long as you don't think too hard about it
","This is one of the shows where your enjoyment depends on your suspension of disbelief. Is the premise ludicrous? Yes. Of course law enforcement would not recruit convicts for a fugitive task force and let them run around without even an electronic tag. And, yes, there are some more plotholes. But if you're willing to just go with it, you will be entertained. Fortunately, the show doesn't take itself too seriously. In one episode there is a storyline threatening the positions of the cons, who then argue about how easily replaceable each of them is - clearly the writers know this is not a serious drama and are willing to make a bit fun of themselves.",/review/rw5895211/?ref_=tt_urv
