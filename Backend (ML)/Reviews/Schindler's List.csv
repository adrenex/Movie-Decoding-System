19 December 2021,Camoo,9," I guess I'm in the minority
","A lot of the reviewers here seem triggered by.. Something. I guess the subject is a lot for people to handle right now. Others angrily use the word 'woke'. It might be one of these shows where critic reviews rave, and audiences will be turned off by the quiet pacing of it all, the time jumping, and others just will not accept that the show has taken the point of view of a female artist as a main protagonist with a global catastrophe as the backdrop.",/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2022,robfollower,9," Grounded Apocalyptic Drama !
",This is first class television. The orchestration and use of sound is phenomenal. The writing while not quite avant-garde does push the envelope for creative thinking and wonderful story telling.,/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,SnoopyStyle,8," a different take on the apocalypse
","There is a pandemic and the world's population gets devastated. Only a small fraction survives. Jeevan Chaudhary (Himesh Patel) is attending a play in Chicago when lead actor Arthur Leander dies on stage. He befriends child actor Kirsten Raymonde (Matilda Lawler) who seems to have no one looking after her in the chaotic aftermath. She is obsessed with the graphic novel Station Eleven. With the deadly flu spreading, Jeevan takes the little girl back to his brother Frank's apartment. Twenty years later, Kirsten (Mackenzie Davis) is part of a traveling performing troupe called the Traveling Symphony. They make the same circular tour each year to perform for small communities around the Chicago area. Their leader and Kirsten's mentor Sarah (Lori Petty) found her alone a couple of years after the devastation but Jeevan is nowhere to be seen.",/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2021,jhester9614,7," Is it bad or is it not your genre?
","It's a slow burn, watching the before, during, and after the world ends. Fun fact: yes, art would survive the fall of civilization just like survived the birth of civilization. And yeah, drama is slow. Shakespeare is slow.",/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2021,Jack_C_,8," Get to episode 5
","The first episode was fantastic but #2 jumps years into the future with slowed down pacing and struggles to create emotional connection or a coherent storyline. If you get past it, episodes 3, 4, and 5 are major reveals that must be watched before you pass judgement on the show.",/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2021,lucaschriskowalski,10," Delivers
","Are the other reviews of the same show? The first episode was brilliant at setting up the narrative and characters. The explosive nature of the illness was on full display, the jumps forward didn't bother me. I do think timing of its release is a bit unfortunate however, when the pandemic began in 2020 ""Contagion"" was Number 1 on the iTunes Charts. People seemed to gravitate to this type of content.",/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2022,saphira_dragon-80270,10," Very special series
","This show is amazing. It is heartwarming and entertaining. It comes full circle. Great story. One of the most creative and original series we have seen in a long time. Exceptional script. Really just a very beautiful series, highly recommend.",/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2021,paul-allaer,8," Outstanding and eerily timely TV mini-series
","As Episode 1 of ""Station Eleven"" (2021 release; 10 episodes of about 45 min each) opens, we are at a Broadway show in Chicago where the lead actor of Shakespeare's King Lear suffers a heart attack on stage. Jeevan, who is in the audience with his girlfriend, tries to save the actor's life but fails. It's not long before things really go south, as a super-flu of some sort is bringing the world to a halt. We then go to ""10 Days Before""... At this point we are less than 15 min into Episode 1.",/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2022,suripat,5," Everything was good until the troupe
","It's weird to see people that liked the show trying to find excuses for those who did not liked it by pointing out to ""people that do not like female protagonists"". What a low point have we reached as a society right now. There are LOTS of great series with female protagonists and good writing. This is not one of them. Live with that, kids. 5 starts for the effort and production.",/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2021,rich-mac,9," Surreal and enigmatic
","Station Eleven (now 5 episodes in) is a slow burn, surreal, and enigmatic. It's clearly not going to be for everyone, but any review under 5 stars isn't doing justice to what is going on with this show.",/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2022,peter-laganis,5," I'll never break my rule of 3 episodes again
","Like many other reviewers already wrote:
Episode 1 is good, not exceptional or breathtaking, but good. All the other ones are (simply put) boooring. On the other hand the cinematography and acting is on high level...
I've managed to watch 5 episodes and am still angry on myself I hadn't stopped at the third one as I always do with shows that don't capture my attention.",/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2022,aratron-00391,5," tedious to watch
","The story really dragged it was so slow..... and never really got all that interesting. Yet the weirdness of it all kept me watching until the end , without much satisfaction.",/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2021,killercola,9," Ignore the one star reviews
","These one star reviews are ridiculous and a waste of peoples time. If you're not doing a serious review then get out of here. This show has a 100% rating on rotten tomatoes. That's how good it is. Three episodes in and I'm completely hooked. So far this show is wonderful and one of the best I've seen this year. Again, ignore these knuckleheads and fake reviews and give this show a go. You wont regret it.",/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2022,therapeuticsuicide,9," Utterly engrossing and unexpected.
","Here is a lot of phenomenal storytelling, world-building and theatre worthy of praise. A simple premise, and an eerily familiar one, in the form of a world-altering pandemic, it's pre-pandemic, as well as its post-pandemic, which could be described as post-apocalyptic, all of which ties in with symbolic messaging from one of its portrayed denizen's printed graphic novel, after which the series is based. Rarely do I favor the employment of a discontinuous narrative, due mostly to fear of its inept use, but here it is employed quite masterfully, both elegant and purposefully revealing, as a successful discontinuous narrative should be. Phenomenal casting, beautiful cinematography, and a magical score, with the exception of the goofy a capella bit, but it wasn't extraordinarily annoying or immersion-breaking, its simply never been a personal preference, and sounded a little silly compared to how great the rest of the otherwise traditional score actually is. Having read the book afterwards, I was amazed how faithfully the series represented a lot of the imagery and drama, not an exact replication, but properly representative of its themes and main characters, with many of the series' scenes playing almost straight off the page. Emily St. John Mandel is a lovely and engaging young writer who writes with a warmth in her breast that you can feel when your eyes pass over the words, one of the very few I can say I have thoroughly enjoyed in this millenia.",/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2022,kellyq12,6," Meandering
","I guess the book meandered, but the philosophical and visual beauty on the page made it worth it. That doesn't translate as well to the screen, so while I was a fan of the book, I found myself a bit bored with series and didn't make it all the way through.",/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2022,stafheyndrickx-490-681654,5," Goes downhill fast!
","As so many reviews are saying: episode 1 is indeed very promising, acting is good, storytelling and directing is also excellent. The main character is preparing for a serious lockdown... But then everything and everybody falls asleep.... The story picks up now and then, but ultimately it's just not worth my time anymore.",/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2022,ricochet93-369-308802,6," Symphony of Destruction
","Himish Patel and David Wilmot are both exceptional in this. While the stories of the initial collapse of society are interesting, the silliness of the ""Travelling Symphony"" really detracts from the the show and really ruin it for me. I was drawn into to flashback stories and then annoyed every time I had to endure the present story line with the Symphony.",/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2022,chris-h-3,5," Opens strongly but then...
",I enjoyed the beginning of the series and all the scenes set in the 'present' however the sections set in the future and the jumping back and forth between the two eventually became too much.,/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2022,normanemailer,4," Watched every episode ..
",I couldn't get involved in this series. It's so fragmented and messy. After a while I longed for some clarification but it never happened. Pretentious and self indulgent.,/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2021,qbswpfyrd,10," Why does everyone want realistic?
","Personally I've had enough of realistic and welcome a change. I don't know I guess there aren't any zombies so the kids are bored. I couldn't look away and became very invested in the story and the mystery to it. I have not read the books so I'm just enjoying this based on its own merits. I'm not sure why low raters think it's unrealistic. Perhaps many of them have never lived with a device in their hands and no longer value the soft arts? Where do you people think art, music and theater came from? The sky? No people went from caves to agriculture and with that came the development of the arts. Something I personally believe separates us from the apes...but whatever. The human spirit was meant to create beauty not wallow in dystopia and tragedy.",/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2022,Siddhartha14,5," Abysmal
","I read the book right before I watched the series. For those reviewers that think the series reflects the book, I heartily disagree. I really liked the book - much food for thought there. This series does a great disservice to the novel. It's simply a mess, and a boring one at that. Truly awful effort to bring this important story to the screen.",/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2022,herichey-67169,5," Odd storylines & characters don't make sense
","I did not enjoy the traveling symphony storyline. It was weird, out of place, and boring. I get art would exist post apocalypse but this was just dumb. Theater kids might love it but I did not. My husband read the book (I did not) and he said he dreaded chapters that would focus on the traveling symphony.",/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2021,bowieec,9," Ignore the day of release one and two star reviews
","I watched the first three episodes today and must have seen a different show. The reviews posted early on the day of release are all one or two stars. That's impossible. The series is well-crafted and really interesting so far with great performances and a tight script. All the criticisms and low ratings seemed similar, maybe from the same person or group. And they were uninformed. Someone mentioned how it's obviously not Chicago. The production began shooting on location in Chicago in January, 2020 and had to stop due to covid. They had two episodes in the can but had to shut down production. They had no option but to move the production to Canada when they were able to resume shooting in January, 2021. This information is readily available all over the internet. And my favorite is when people say how ""unrealistic"" it is. I'm sorry, this is based on a fictional book written before our latest pandemic. And the pandemic in the novel is completely different. Why do trolls reviewers try so hard to bring everything down immediately? I'll update my review once the series is over but please, don't go by the reviews posted the day of release, all those one or two stars ones. There's no way they watched all ofthe first three episodes. One person gave it one star and admitted they had only watched 15 minutes total. How can you possibly give a review of something after watching 15 minutes of an hour long program? It's so sad that trolls have taken over imdb member reviews.",/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2021,wildbroncgirl,8," Here's why I like it.
","I have only watched the first episode. However I liked the pace and dialogue. I'm sick and tired of over-acted, dizzying fast story lines, pointless dialogue - which I think 90% of movies have today. Maybe I'll hate this show later but so far I like it. It's not something to put on in the background while you clean the house. I think I get the premise - we survive a pandemic (or don't) and then what? We can't stay in survival mode forever. This isn't a typical apocalyptic show so move on if that's what you are expecting.",/review/rw7651296/?ref_=tt_urv
