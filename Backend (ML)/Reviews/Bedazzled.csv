17 October 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," Brilliant fun, and a near perfect film from newb filmmakers.
","This comedy-horror film is a must-see fun ride, just in time for Halloween season. Husband and wife duo Joseph and Vanessa Winter co-wrote, co-produced, co-directed, etc, with Joseph also in the starring role, and this guy is legit hilarious.",/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,kosmasp,8," Found Ghost Hunting Footage
","No pun intended - and before you shut off: yes I am wary when I read about a movie being or using the ""found footage"" genre or whatever you want to call it. The movie on hand here is quite fresh though and makes fun of the usual tropes. And achieves something that I would not think possible: making this fun and entertaining with just one lead character! Blair Witch send three people into the woods - this only needs one - an influencer, because he interacts with his followers. And some random people who just jump on his stream I reckon.",/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2022,dizznmo,8," New Generation Evil Dead
","A fun ride! Definitely brought me back to the original crazy fun Evil Dead! Not sure if they meant to pay homage to Raimi but they definitely did! Would have given a 9 but while the ending made sense just not as awesome as the rest of the movie. Hard to top Bruce Campbell as Ash but this guy playing Shawn came pretty darn close! Dang, why so many characters IMBD? I feel like I have to write an essay. Anyways to the younger generation if you enjoyed this you gotta watch Evil Dead 1981 and Evil Dead 2 which was even more campy and over the top! To my fellow Generation Xer's, who might pass it up, check it out!",/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2022,BandSAboutMovies,8," It's great!
","Shawn Ruddy (Joseph Winter, who also co-directed and co-write this with Vanessa Winter) is a disgraced internet streamer and influencer infamous for stunts like the Baby Moses challenge, in which he goes down a river in a basket, and the video that got him in trouble as he abuses a homeless person. To win back his fans, he has decided to go one on one with his greatest fear: ghosts.",/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2022,subxerogravity,7," It is a funny parody on Blair Witch!!
","That's what I see from Deadstream. This was an amazingly funny movie. I was not sure what to expect when watching this movie. I can be very indifferent about movies that ingrate contemporary technology that influences the culture...like social media, but they picked the right dude to play the semi lone person in this movie. He had a strange balance of being funny with being scared but his being scared made me fear what was about to happen to him. I love his character and how he developed and you can clearly see what type of person he is which lends to both the comedy and the horror. It does lean one way more than the other for too long but I don't need to nick pick, it was good.",/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,brandonlewissmu,7," It's Dashcam but the main character isn't awful
","The problem with Dashcam was that the girl was maybe the most unlikable idiot I've ever seen in a film. The main character here is great. He plays the obnoxious viewer-chasing blogger but in a way you genuinely like him. Also, the story uses the livestream far better. It's almost like a Who Wants To Be A Millionaire lifeline. It's an asset to the story, not just an aspect.",/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,SnoopyStyle,5," girly scream
",Disgraced YouTuber Shawn Ruddy tries to regain his audience and credibility by spending one night in a haunted house. He live-casts from inside the rundown old house when superfan Chrissy interrupts.,/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,rynrox,8," Top Tier Horror
","This had just the perfect mix of creepiness/horror, plus social commentary and humour (without the cringe factor). The main actor who also co-wrote and directed the movie does an incredible job of keeping your attention for so long.",/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,SoumikBanerjee25,6," I have mixed feelings on this one
","To tell you the truth, I don't know what to make of this whole facade! On one hand, I was pretty amused by the comedic punchlines as well as their clever use of horror-specific elements but on the other hand, the constant tonal shifts put me out of the experience not once but multiple times!",/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2022,Xstal,3," Ectospasm...
","Credit where credits due, it achieves very well what it sets out to do, an intimate account of a night inside a house, that's haunted by a ghost, who's about as frightening as a mouse, with an irritating lead, and his overzealous feed, if you make it to the end, you will be driven round the bend, with the second rate prosthetics, predictable and prosaic antics, not a scare for love nor money, exponentially gets less funny, except for when Shawn's covered in, a bucketful of his urine - at which point you wish he'd had the overwhelming urge to empty the contents of his large colon into the bucket at the same time.",/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2022,Kronenbourg16,4," Too much like watching an annoying youtuber.
","I knew a bit about this movie before watching, and was dubious because I can't bear the loud and obnoxious, screamy, soy-bearded youtubers. I had hoped that this movie would show us a break-down of one of these people. Show the progression from fake screaming and sh-- talking to real terror..This would be the most interesting thing to make of the premise, but this movie doesn't achieve that. The fake screaming and insincerity just continues to escalate to farcical proportions, and then the movie overtly becomes a farce, and then it finishes.",/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,mf2812,10," Brilliant!
","We found footage fans are a rare breed. We all fully admit that we have to trawl through many, many terrible attempts to find a good one. This is not a good one, but a great one! Shawn, (""Joseph Winter"" who is also the director), is absolutely hilarious! The film centres on a disgraced YouTube influencer who's finally allowed back on social media after a six month ban for paying a bum to fight him and hospitalising him. His next endeavour is to go into a ""supposed"" haunted house for the night on his own with hilarious and sometimes scary scenarios. That's all I'll say because it's better off going into this one blind. It's a sure-fire cult status movie in the making and deserves any awards it hopefully receives. It's original and fresh in a saturated market of meh type movies. Fun and entertaining. Highly recommended!",/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,tiskec,7," A Good Time
","This movie is actually quite fun. It's a mixture of horror, jump scares and comedy. Shawn as the main character was funnier than hell. The way that he expresses his fear just had me rolling.",/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,ian-j-williams75,8," ""The Evil Dead"" meets ""The Blair Witch project""
","I've been looking for a good horror comedy for a while and this definitely scratched that itch. If you like the idea of ""Evil Dead"" meets ""The Blair Witch project"" then this is one for you.",/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,icocleric,9," Over The Top Hilarious Gore
","I'm here for this film, even though I'm very critical of found footage films. I really enjoyed the set up of this one because its done as a stream. I liked the way cameras were set up in different locations on the house and they're clearly good cameras, and there's very little of the ""shaky cam"".",/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2022,PutneyTrope,6," A found footage haunted house horror comedy that actually works! Quite fun.
","This is a found footage/haunted house film. It's also a comedy where the humor hits at multiple levels (something for everyone). It's a film firmly rooted in 2022, so it's destined to be a more of a time capsule curiosity rather than timeless. It had a decent set-up. Only two characters. Familiarity of the nature of YouTube streaming personalities is useful, but not required (There is a lot of humor to be read onscreen as you see a live stream chat and all the comments). The horror? It was actually quite fun! Practical effects that were charming. The setting was well-chosen and especially creepy. Listening to the lead character crack wise constantly didn't detract from some decent tension building. Had a few moments that I'd call gently chilling. Clever use of body cams in a survival horror situation. If you enjoyed the Evil Dead films - you'll feel quite comfortable with this one. The humor is all over the place and does approach zany Sam Raimi levels at times. Maintaining credible humor and horror at the same time can be difficult. The movie did start to falter a slight bit (you'll have the layout of the house memorized by film's end). Would have played better at an hour long, but any filler is forgivable. If you love haunted house investigations - I'd consider checking this out. This was pretty fun.",/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2022,I_Ailurophile,10," Fabulously smart, funny, well made - a total blast!
","I'll be honest, I've been looking forward to this for a long while. It first came to my attention because of the involvement of Melanie Stone; I've seen most of her movies at this point, and I really like her as an actor. Then, in following film-making spouses Joseph and Vanessa Winter online, I saw how much they love horror, and I became further enticed with what snippets they discussed on social media. Add in excellent word of mouth, and 'Deadstream' has rather had high expectations to live up to - and in my opinion it still handily exceeds them. This is phenomenal!",/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2022,patrickkeown,1," Garbage
","Disagree with some of the reviews here, which just goes to show you that we're all so very different! It is such a terrible film. I thought the main ""actor"" was incredibly annoying to the point where I just couldn't watch it anymore. Even if being annoying is ""the point,"" he still acted in such a (bad) way that made me want nothing more than to turn the movie off. Thankfully, it wasn't in a theater and I gladly turned it off eventually...and honestly I'm not sad about it. This movie, from everything that I saw, doesn't deserve to be considered part of the horror genre nor should it have wasted anyone's time or money to get made. Don't watch this thing. Utter garbage.",/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,manuelasaez,5," More comedy than horror, and the SFX was atrocious.
","Let's keep this review short because my title says it all. It's a horror/comedy that skews VERY heavily on the comedic side with almost nothing about it that's genuinely scary. If you're into zoomer comedy that's random and nonsensical, this will be right up your alley. It's geared towards the short attention span, average IQ Twitch/streamer audience that would rather watch someone experience something than actually go out and experience anything themselves. In short, this movie was not made for people like me. I did chuckle a few times, but that was mainly because the protagonist screamed like a little girl throughout most of the movie.",/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,mattjportch-996-832071,3," Not scary. Not funny. Dumb.

9 October 2022,degrees-33365,1," Utterly terrible
",I guess it's 'nice' that he managed to get all his friends to come here and give this garbage high ratings - and it's a pretty safe bet as well as there will only ever be a handful of people watching this...'movie'.,/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,TwistedContent,8," A Fun Protagonist goes through a Great Blend of Horror and Comedy
","A great surprise of a horror movie, shudder has given us one of its best originals to date! All found-footage, haunted-house, comedy-horror fans gather 'round, because Joseph & Vanessa Winter have conjured up a low-budget nightmare that's equal parts funny and scary, original and inspired, fun and thought provoking. ""Deadstream"" is not without its flaws, but it's a hoot, I promise.",/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2022,venomtruth,7," A Fun Ride
","Made me laugh thru out the 1st half of the movie - just outstanding. The 2nd half got slightly creepier and developed the only way it could. The ending was a let down and kind of showed the cheapness of the special effects etc. But this does not take away from the actor playing a difficult role of an obnoxious but hilariously funny Youtuber. Perfect for Halloween and for fits of laughter. Not really too scary but scary enough for some nervous smiles and a perfect fit for today's world. Again Kudos to the actor who played the protagonist. He captured the irritating, bumbling, kind of obnoxious person perfectly (humorously). And this I do not take for granted..",/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2022,msvicki1224,1," DUMBSTREAM!!!
","Where do I begin??? This movie sucked and was beyond dumb, stupid and boring!!! Although it was boring for the first thirty minutes, I continued to watch it in hopes that it would get better but it never happened!!! The main character had such an annoying voice to the point where I almost stopped watching this piece of crap that they call a movie!!! It made absolutely no sense either that while he is doing his dumb live haunted house stream that no viewer called the police after seeing what was going on during the live stream!!! What kind of follower or even just a viewer watches a live video of someone being hurt and does nothing??? Even if they didn't know his exact location, by them taking their phone to the police station and showing them the live stream, the police would've been able to locate the guy. I wish I could rate this comedy a negative 0 because it was horrendous!!! The positive reviews on here are most definitely fake or from family members of the characters in this movie because there's no way that a real person would like this train wreck!!!! Lol.",/review/rw8648682/?ref_=tt_urv
