9 April 2017,Carycomic,8," Pretty good family flick! But, it's going to be overshadowed by POWER RANGERS.
","How do I know? Because I went to see both movies this weekend. And, while there only eight other people (besides myself) in the theater showing the Saban reboot, I was quite literally _the only one_ in the theater showing SMURFS: TLV!",/review/rw3672637/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2017,Bulldog1721,10," The smurfs done right, *for a change*
","This movie was a masterpiece in its own element! It was how I remembered my favorite cartoon as they ran through a forest, on an adventure, with that true Smurfs charm which really made me blush like crazy! Don't get me wrong, but the Smurfs and Smurfs 2 was pretty good and they were unique; but, this movie was the right way to do a Smurfs movie! This movie is such a treat! The family will love it! I am sure of it! And seeing it in 3D was even better! So I highly recommend seeing in 3D, it's worth the extra bucks!",/review/rw3672637/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2017,MaximeLoonatic,8," This movie is the perfect Smurfs movie
","This has all the spirit of Peyo. The bad critics are unfair, because they do not see the fact that this is made for the children and the adults that has them in their childhood. This movie has develop Smurfette's personality and role in the movie; she is more than the pretty girl who has the attention of the rest of Smurfs boys. The new smurfs girls lived in the forbidden forest creating an own culture and tradition that resembles the cult of the natives, which I found it very pleasant. And to end my positive critic, I believe this should go to a new step and make a new TV series of the Smurfs",/review/rw3672637/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2017,vasanisalim,10," Nice, clean family entertainer
","I got to see the advance screening of the move with my kids. I enjoyed the fast pace of the movie and the exciting story line. Kids did not get bored throughout the movie. Unlike some movies that are geared towards boys or girls specifically, this movie entertains both boys and girls. There was no vulgarity in the movie and no unnecessary violence.",/review/rw3672637/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2017,northfacingphotography,8," I'm letting my child write the review (except he can't write yet)
","I don't know what people are expecting from a kids movie. Its the smurfs. Its not like they were going to come out and make a new take on a classic. My son, who just turned six, said he loved it. The animation was beautiful. There were parts that did seem truly original. I enjoyed it and Frank Welker did an awesome job as always. I don't want to spoil anything, but the end credits scene was really funny to me. None of the recent kids movies I've seen have been all that original except Kubo and it was special in its blend of traditional and CG animation. See the Smurfs, or rent it, your kids will love it.",/review/rw3672637/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2017,specialo-86327,9," Fantastic Fully Animated Movie
","The Smurfs - The Lost village is a tribute to Peyo and his artistic ability in 1958 in creating the Smurfs. Great work to the director, crew, stars and of course Sony Animation to creating a lost village like no person not even some Smurfs has ever seen before. Avatar had loads of colour. The Lost village is that and more. Great movie for everyone.",/review/rw3672637/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2017,hugopulsar,10," Finally Hefty and Smurfette!
","Absolutely loved the movie :) They took the original cartoons and rebooted the whole thing in a very cool fashion. And Hefty has always been my favorite, so it was so damn cool to see the team back together again. The ending was very very emotional. Hope to see more Smurfs after this one. Way to go!",/review/rw3672637/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2017,dmartinez-52655,7," Enjoyable to some demographics
","In 2011 Sony Pictures brought a revival movie to the original comic and 80's animated TV show The Smurfs that seemed like a good idea...right? WRONG! the disastrous Live-Action Smurfs film that had high celebrity voices, Irrelevany Product Placement, and cameos that didn't help the story at all. the film and fell flat with barely making back its budget that left adults childhoods ruined. Later in 2013 was the just as bad sequel to The Smurfs that failed more than the first with the same premise of cameos, unnecessary characters and product placement, and was downright awful spawning the films to roll in peyo's grave. Later in 2017 is a fresh breath of air from the terrible Smurfs movies that Sony made, despite this new being made by Sony. Smurfs The Lost Village is Directed by Kelly Asbury, the same director behind Shrek 2, Shrek the Third, Gnomeo and Juliet, and Spirit. The Movie's plot has best friends Smurfette (Demi Lovato), Brainy (Danny Pudi), Clumsy (Jack McBrayer) and Hefty (Joe Manganiello) use a map that guides them through the Forbidden Forest and wonderland that's filled with magical creatures. Their adventure leads them on a course to discover the biggest secret in Smurf history as they race against time and the evil wizard Gargamel (Rainn Wilson) to find a mysterious village. The plot is your basic Lord of the Rings like quest where the characters are forced to handle environments and new creature that would either friend or eat them. It is a reused basic scheme that Hollywood uses, but it's the execution to the specific details of what matters. The Characters are mostly reminiscent to the creator, Peyo's vision, and maybe some changes that either compel or drag the story either feeling annoying or acceptable. I feel that most of the background Smurfs would have been more reliable and interesting rather than the main smurfs. While the acting is great with the voices not being original and rather that happy-go-lucky charm you either find endearing or redundant. The animation I will say is great though, and seeing the smurfs having more of a look to the comics did feel charming with how the other two, felt...creepy. This movie has it's feel of the Trolls film from 2016 in which they kinda stole their expedition with revealing them in a musical standard. Despite the similar impact, the movie does feel better with the movie barely spewing pop culture references and worthless innuendos. Overall, The Smurfs lost village is good movie despite the childlike humor in most scenes while giving a more character impact whether if you found the useful or useless to the plot. The Plot is executed well in which i give credit for being better than the CGI smurfs movies. This movie can be better for some demographics specifically for younger audiences while boring adults or older teens. The movie is what i call enjoyable for a Point of View whether if you are a child with a pov for thrill seeing characters going on an adventure facing many adversity and discovering a new life. You can pay respect respect for this film considering it has a lower budget than the other terrible Smurfs movies of 60 million with the others being over 100 million, that is bull. I thought the movie was good despite some concerns in the characters not being that reminiscent from Peyo's original vision. If your child or little brother wants a smile on his face, let him watch this movie, and it is a better excuse to just enjoy it better than the previous trash films. B",/review/rw3672637/?ref_=tt_urv

",I went to see this movie over the holidays and i absolutely loved it there were plenty of new friends to make and it was super fun my only gripe is that it took so long to get to the girl Smurfs when the previews made it seem like they were gonna be in the entire movie but aside from that it was good and i definitely recommend that you go see it take the family and have a good smurfiing time,/review/rw3672637/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2017,akrabbit,10," Classic Peyo
","Brilliant animation work. Smurfette looked like Peyo's Smurfette instead of the half human half smurf humonculus that was the first two movies. Seriously, the first two were a mockery of the smurfs. Hefty needed to be in them and this time he was. The voice acting was spot on and Demi Lovato voiced Smurfette perfectly and the animation captured her sweetness. People who say it is rubbish are not fans of the Smurfs and should not be taken as credible critics. The Smurfs needed to be done right and now it has. I could share this with my kids and say"" This is what I watched as a kid and learned tolerance of other's differences."" Everyone was different and that was okay, in fact it was treasured. Where is the heart in movies now days? I loved it! Brings back childhood memories.",/review/rw3672637/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2017,anthonymasson,8," A very good time with the smurfs
","Better than the ""realistics"" movies, this new Smurf adventure in 3D animation is a pleasure. New history, new characters and a new world, all ingredients for a good time with or without child ! Only one thing : if the movie was a little bit longer, and don't have a ""quick"" end, it had 10/10",/review/rw3672637/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2017,secundus-76721,10," Awesome film, true to Peyo's original comics
","The Smurfs The Lost Village is the latest offering from Sony Picture Animation, the team that brought you Goosebumps and Cloudy with a chance of meatballs. As a longtime smurf fan, it is without question that I would go to see this film. I was delighted with this latest film, its animation is beautiful, the look of the smurfs is faithfully recreated from the well loved cartoons of Peyo. The depiction of the smurf village is stunning and the detail of the characters is lovely, you can see every texture and this really adds to the movie. The new characters are a nice addition, finally Smurfette isn't the only girl in the village. The character voices are handled well and are in keeping with the feel of the film. I would recommend it wholeheartedly to everyone, children and adults alike. I hope to see more films and lots more merchandise. I would love to see more stories that include Johan & Peewit and Homnibus etc..well done Sony Pictures Animation on a glorious film",/review/rw3672637/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2017,gembayang,10," A perfect family movie! I give it 100%!
","The artwork is amazing and the visuals are a feast for the eyes. Great movie for kids to encourage their imagination. The story is entertaining and brought a lot of laughter to the audience. By the way, 3D is really worth the money! ",/review/rw3672637/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2017,foghorn_leghorn-51598,10," Great animation
","Sony outdid themselves with this movie. I have been waiting for a long time in anticipation of this movie and it definitely did not disappoint me. If you liked the first two then this is a must see movie, and is great for children and the kid at heart. I look forward to Sony making another Smurfs movie in the future but please don't take so long next time. Keep on Smurfing.",/review/rw3672637/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2017,chaserray,10," A great homage to the classic Smurf characters
","""Smurfs: The Lost Village"" is a story that fits nicely between the classic Peyo comics and the Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning cartoon. The animation is beautifully done. There is no way you can take every little detail in with just one viewing. The plot is fairly straightforward with adventure at the forefront. This film avoids the misplaced pop culture references and overused Smurf puns that many disliked about the previous movies. ""Smurfs: The Lost Village"" aims for a younger audience, but adults shouldn't have a problem remembering why they liked these characters themselves.",/review/rw3672637/?ref_=tt_urv

","Attention parents of young children. I saw Smurfs: The Lost Village on Friday night and recommend that you ignore the mostly negative reviews. This animated film features fast action, magical colors, fun music, and a whole new magical Smurf village of fire-breathing dragonflies and—girl Smurfs! Went to an 8 PM show, but there were some children there—I heard lots of laughter and saw one girl dancing in the aisle. Go, enjoy, and let your kids have fun at a movie made just for them.",/review/rw3672637/?ref_=tt_urv

","La La La La La La, sing a happy song! It's an intro will never forget for not only its ability to get stuck in my head, but also for the show it represents. The Smurfs' legacy has extended over the decades into a plethora of forms primarily in the TV shows and movies of the 80s. After a six-year hiatus from the live action movies, the blue creatures return to the silver screen to try to regain footing. Will the new style work, or does it fall much like the character Clumsy Smurf? Robbie K here with a review on the Smurfs: The Lost Village. Let's get started. ",/review/rw3672637/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2017,monstermayhem32,6," The return of the smurfs
","Four years after the second smurfs movie which didn't do well domestically but gets a reboot in this version, I will admit that I miss hearing the smurfs gags like the happy song and mentioning the word smurf but it should be enjoyable for fans of the cartoons. The film also has a new cast in which Demi lovsto takes over the smurfette role. Mandy pantankin takes over from the late Johnathan winters as papa smurf. Jack mcbayer takes over the clumsy role from the late Anton yelchin who was great in the role.",/review/rw3672637/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2017,akberry-79206,9," Peyo's cartoons come alive!
","I went to see this film with my family today. It was beautifully made and had plenty of laughs involving Gargamel and his minions. I also liked the way that the plot from the Smurfs 2 sort of carried on a little, but only having ONE human in this film made it much better. No New York or Paris. Firmly in the Smurfs world where they all belong. My only gripe is that some of the pop songs were a bit annoying. I would recommend anyone to go and see this film. Forget about Smurfs 1 and 2 and even Hannah Barbara! This is TRUE Peyo!",/review/rw3672637/?ref_=tt_urv

7 April 2017,darrellkaelin,9," Third time's the charm
","First off, I've been a smurfs fan/collector for over 30 years now and I'm going to be as unbiased as possible. Despite its flaws, I loved the first Smurfs live action movie from 2011 and unfortunately I have a hard time watching 'Smurfs 2' in it's entirety. Simply put, 'Lost Village' gets back to its roots and is the best of the Sony Pictures Animation offerings. It may not have the depth of most Pixar movies but the movie has heart and it stays true to what the Smurfs are. I'm planning on seeing it again in 3D (which I'm not a huge fan of) due to overall visuals in the movie which really popped even in 2D. The only concern I had originally is how Rainn Wilson would be as Gargamel since it's hard to top Paul Winchell's Gargamel from the classic Hanna- Barbera series but he brought something new & different and I wasn't disappointed with it. Definitely worth seeing on the big screen and be sure to stay during the credits for a little added bonus about halfway through. Overall A-/B+",/review/rw3672637/?ref_=tt_urv

",Britons of a certain age will remember the Smurfs via a very annoyingly memorable song by Father Abraham which once heard is never forgotten no matter how hard you try. In other words I'm not a fan of the blue ones but since I want to expand my film watching experience I thought I'd see what the mainstream audience are watching at the multiplex.

28 March 2017,MichaelNontonMulu,7," The First 3D Animated Movie of the Cute Smurfs
","Well this is the first time Smurfs movie was done in 3D animation. The previous 2 movies were all combined with humans with some well known actors and actresses played in the movie such as Neil Patrick Harris, Jayma Mays and Hank Azaria. The animation of this movie was done very beautifully and I am pretty sure the 3D effects are very good (although I did not see the movie in 3D, but I can imagine some scenes that would be very great seen in 3D). Furthermore, the movie was shot in 3D and not converted into 3D at later stage like other recent live action movies. So the effects would definitely be good.",/review/rw3672637/?ref_=tt_urv
