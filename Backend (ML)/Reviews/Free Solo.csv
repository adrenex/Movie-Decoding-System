17 October 2009,oOgiandujaOo_and_Eddy_Merckx,9," Ambitious, deeply mystic and provocative movie with earth-shattering FX
","Gaspar Noé's big beast of a Cannes entrant showed for the first time in the UK this week in October. Gaspar Noé was there to introduce the film, which was a great kick for me, even though he didn't do a Q&A. His intro was quite funny, because he's not a grand intellectual, he's more of a sensualist. It's clear that he had a pretty dissipated youth and he talked about his experimentation with hallucinogenics and he always wondered as a kid why nobody was making movies with the images like he was seeing whilst high in them. So this is a movie I think he's wanted to make for a very long time, perhaps a couple of decades, but only now has he been able to get the freedom and funding to do it.",/review/rw2128950/?ref_=tt_urv

6 March 2011,Jonny_Numb,4," Null and Void
","With each film, director Gaspar Noe aims to provoke, disorient, and even violate the viewer in some way; as a result, one gets the impression that he invites the vitriol of those who would slam his cinematic vision. Now, while I was compelled (if not ""entertained"") by the near-pornographic subjectivity of Noe's ""I Stand Alone"" (the tale of a sociopath butcher wandering around France with a whole lot of pent-up anger) and ""Irreversible"" (a backwards-unraveling tale of revenge and rape), ""Enter the Void"" is an agonizingly overlong tale of death and the Afterlife that mistakes neon-saturated, drug-trip informed imagery as a profound comment on a world beyond our own mortality. In its first half, ""Void"" manages to compel and intrigue, even if our grating and unsympathetic protagonists (a brother-and-sister duo living in Japan as a drug dealer and a stripper, respectively) do very little to make all the flashy neon seem like more than aesthetic window-dressing. At 90 minutes, ""Void"" is a passable (if largely empty) film, but as it crawls towards the 3-hour mark, it becomes obnoxious, intolerable, and infuriating (with Noe's pretentious excesses -- culminating in a literal orgy -- becoming the stuff of yawns rather than gasps).",/review/rw2128950/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2016,SnoopyStyle,4," original and fascinating and boring after ten minutes
",Oscar (Nathaniel Brown) and his sister Linda (Paz de la Huerta) live in Tokyo. He's a small time drug dealer. His friend Alex (Cyril Roy) gives him The Tibetan Book of the Dead about the Buddhist belief in the afterlife. Oscar goes to a club called The Void. They are raided by the police. He holds out in the bathroom trying to flush his drugs and is shot through the door. His spirit rises out of his body and witnesses his life.,/review/rw2128950/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2010,radioheadrcm,9," Relentlessly Nauseating Modern Art
","Enter the Void is exactly the kind of polarizing film that cinema needs right now. Too many films these days play it safe, being concerned with keeping the audience comfortable, safe and happy. Enter Gaspar Noe, who clearly has no regard either for the well-being of either the audience or his actors. We have antagonistically long (but brilliant) takes, beginning in an apartment and ending in a bar, several blocks over. We are given characters and are exposed to their darkest moments, but are never given a real reason to care for them, or to perceive them as anything but wretched. We are also shown some sexually discomforting things that we never really wanted to see on the silver screen (if you've seen it you probably know what I'm talking about). Also, the film is almost completely in first-person viewpoint, so you're constantly feeling confined to what Oscar is looking at, which are mostly psychedelic images. In effect, the feel and tone of the story are immediately off-putting for the viewer, but since you've already bought a ticket, what can you do but follow it through? ",/review/rw2128950/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2009,grmagne,9," Stunning...in many ways
","If the following things disturb you, then you should probably avoid this film: strobe lights, drug use, shaky hand-held cameras, graphic sexuality, sperm, spinning cameras, psychedelic imagery, blood, gay sex, abortion, breastfeeding or a graphic auto wreck.",/review/rw2128950/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2010,chaaa,7," Crazy, but technically brilliant!
","In a nutshell, Gaspar Noe's often exasperating but always visionary Enter the Void follows a man on his journey from his last hours on earth, through his death and his journey into the afterlife. The first twenty minutes or so follows Oscar as he takes a hit of DMT (a very potent hallucinogen) and goes on a visually arresting, if slightly over-long trip. He then leaves his house to give his friend a stash of drugs he owes him only to be chased and shot by police when he gets there. From there, his death and afterlife mirrors the philosophies behind the Tibetan Book of the Dead which theorises (I'm sure I'm putting this very crudely) that one's soul floats around, watching the world without them until they figure out how to leave their old life behind and move on. To recommend this film to audiences is perhaps a wrong turn, as it is bound to strike most as indulgent, immoral, needlessly vulgar and uncomfortable (particularly in Oscar's tendency to watch his sister having sex whenever possible). However, with suitably forewarning, this is a film that any self-respecting cinephile should make a point of seeing, and especially on the big screen.",/review/rw2128950/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2020,OdinsRagnarok,3," Technically and conceptually interesting... but extremely boring.
","While the concept and technical execution of the movie is very good and interesting, it's a shame it's wasted on terrible editing and pacing. This isn't an epic tale with tons of twists and turns that needs a long time to tell it all. It's a fairly simple story, but padded out to the extreme with ""sequences"" between each scene.",/review/rw2128950/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2010,dbborroughs,3," I hope the shorter American release version has less of the back and forth flying sequences because they utterly stop the film dead.

15 March 2011,tedg,," Tomorrow Never Knows
","One of our next great filmmakers, yet another South American, makes a film about French filmmaking. That once great tradition was compromised in the sixties by a burst of non-sustainable creativity that ate itself. A decent enough metaphor is that cinema overdosed on introspective drugs. Now we get a film that both chronicles that rebirth and is the product of it.",/review/rw2128950/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2009,larry-411,7," Trippy & dreamy, but be sure you're prepared
","I attended the International Premiere of ""Enter the Void"" at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Fans of director Gaspar Noé, whose film ""Irreversible"" created a significant following, will not be disappointed. At two and a half hours long, this film is definitely not for everyone. But I knew that going in and got exactly what I'd hoped for and more. It's trippy, dreamy, and mesmerizing and left me shaking my head in wonder many times. Startling and risky performances punctuate the dazzling visuals. The biggest surprise for me: ""Enter the Void"" has much more of a narrative than I was expecting. I was prepared for a cinematic acid trip, which I got, but there is an actual storyline which threads through the experimental camera-work and effects which are at the heart of the film. I highly recommend this movie but with qualifications, though. There is a great deal of drug use and some explicit sex but the film is compelling.",/review/rw2128950/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2010,Radu_A,8," The intellectual's 'Inception' - a 'Now I've seen it all' death trip back to life
","So what could I add to what has been stated in the other reviews? Yes, 'Enter the Void' is definitely a trippy mindbuster, and as such anyone who requires story or frames to enjoy a film should give it a miss. Yes, the visuals are eye-popping and the ubiquitous stroboscope effects may cause severe nausea - I watched it on BR and couldn't help but thinking what an advantage home entertainment can be over cinema exposure. This is a film which may be best enjoyed alone, somewhat stoned or drunk, and very late at night. And the pause button is definitely a life-saver.",/review/rw2128950/?ref_=tt_urv

","I tried, guys, I promise. But after 1.5 hours of not much happening except for a gazillion flashing lights, a LOT of flying overhead, and a ton of weirdness just for the sake of being weird. I feel that after an hour and half, if you're not feelin' the movie, you ain't gonna. There could be a good idea buried somewhere in this mess but I was too bored to find it.",/review/rw2128950/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2011,DonFishies,5," A unique, experimental trip that is clearly not for everyone
","There really is no way to properly review Enter the Void, the film by Gaspar Noé (of Irreversible notoriety). It premiered at film festivals around the world almost two years ago, and is only now available on DVD this week. I saw the trailer for the film last fall and was immediately intrigued, even without knowing much about the film. And now after having seen the film in all of its uncut 161 minute glory, I still am unsure if I know all that much about it.",/review/rw2128950/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2017,manisimmati,3," A Contrived Audiovisual Orgy
","""Enter the Void"" is the cinematic equivalent of an epileptic fit. Beginning with the opening credits, Argentinian director Gaspar Noé seeks to overwhelm us with frantic flickering and humming. Then we are thrown into the first-person perspective of Oscar, a drug dealer in Tokyo. But that doesn't last for long, because poor Oscar gets betrayed by a friend and ambushed by the police. He flees to the toilet of the eponymous bar ""The Void"", where he gets shot. From this point on, the camera represents Oscar's soul, whirling through Tokyo and waiting for some kind of redemption or resurrection.",/review/rw2128950/?ref_=tt_urv

","Where to start? I saw this film nearly a month ago at Melbourne International Film Festival. I haven't quite been able to shake it from my brain since!

10 October 2010,colinrgeorge,7," Enter at Your Own Risk
","One thing's for sure, you won't leave Gaspar Noé's ""Enter the Void"" with comparisons ready. More than likely, you won't want to think about it at all. Over two and a quarter hours, the film hijacks your consciousness like a potent hallucinogen, and leaves you feeling burnt out and brain-fried on the other end.",/review/rw2128950/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2014,p-stepien,4," Drifting in oblivion. With pizazz.
","Gaspard Noe big bang return misfires with the ultimate clash of style over substance. When a young American drug dealer Oscar (Nathaniel Brown) inadvertently gets gunned down by trigger-happy policemen in downtown Tokyo, a concoction of drugs and sensory overload deliver an after-life experience like no other ever presented in cinema. As Oscar drifts out of his body we view the world through his mind's eye in a collage of flashbacks, flash-forwards and overall time anachronism that would make Terence Mallick green with envy. As we weightlessly venture over Tokyo we observe the lives of those left behind, like Oscar's long lost, recently found stripper sister Linda (Paz de la Huerta), whom he promised never to leave behind or view the ordeals of Alex (Cyril Roy), Oscar's best mate, now hectically on the run from police.",/review/rw2128950/?ref_=tt_urv

19 September 2009,jaredmobarak,8," Did they hear me? Did I scream?  Enter the Void
","Words can seriously not describe the visually rich and assaulting epic tale of death and its aftermath of memories and spiritual travel that is Gaspar Noé's Enter the Void. Self-proclaimed as ""weird"" by the director himself at it's World Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, (the print screened at Cannes was a work-in-progress), he says his attempt was to create a near death experience on film. So, with stunning imagery; fullscreen frames of solid bright color pulsating at epileptic seizure-inducing rates; extended moments of seamless cutting to make long passages appear to be one take; first person camera-work spliced from straight shots merging into fish-eye lens distortion; extreme close-ups, either computer generated or otherwise, appearing as though a fly filmed the entire thing while in flight; and just the maze-like electricity of downtown Tokyo at night, one must actually sit down and experience it, letting it wash over you, to fully appreciate the work. Noé is a genius of some kind, always on the fringes of the industry, appalling some, disgusting others, and written off by the rest, yet I can't genuinely say I'd recommend anyone seeing this movie. And therein lies the problem, if words can't describe it and I couldn't in good conscience send you to see it due to the extensive drug use, realistic sex scenes, and harrowing moments of graphic brutality, what else is there to do? It definitely is an important film to the industry, though, just in the technical prowess on display. Noé has an eye for cinema, utilizing who knows what for shots that I've never seen before. He said after the screening that a lot of post-production was necessary to craft every moment into the piece of art he finished with. Aerial shots of the cities were recreated with computers, frames were meticulously darkened or lightened when needed, (the auteur is so specific and detail-oriented that when the film ended he came up and said he'd never seen it so dark, the projector must be different than his, but what could he do?), and the giant phallus that is mentioned everywhere when speaking of the movie is an interesting moment because there is no way you could put a camera where it would be needed to capture that shot. There are religious underpinnings laid throughout between a Buddhist book given to our lead Oscar to peruse or the issue of reincarnation and whether the soul traveling after his death was finding itself a new vessel to be reborn in or just a journey back, recalling his own conception. Noé mentioned that he wanted it to feel like the time he watched the Lady in the Lake on mushrooms; I can't say I've ever done hallucinogens, but I can imagine the feeling would be similar to watching this work.",/review/rw2128950/?ref_=tt_urv
