","The original FINAL DESTINATION was a smart reworking of the teen horror film . Instead of horny teenagers getting their heads lopped off by a mad axeman in a mask , the protagonists , who are composed of a cross section of society , are stalked by the worst monster in the world - death itself . FINAL DESTINATION 2 follows the same formula ",/review/rw1388579/?ref_=tt_urv

31 January 2003,Agent10,7," Creepier, gorier and better put together than the first
","I was apprehensive when I didn't Devon Sawa in the credits or this movie, but then again, this film didn't really need him. This wasn't a sequel in the purest sense, but the film makers created methods to link all of the new characters to the old ones, creating a flow which wasn't too jarring. Unfortunately, the dialogue was the only real stinker in this film. The pretentiousness, the obviousness and the downright hokiness that came out of the mouths of the characters really detracted from the tension, turning their performances into a bunch of acting class rejects. But I digress. The only thing people are looking for is how Death will get the new set of escape artists. The sheer surprise and execution of the executions made me jump and crawl. In such a desensitized world we live in, being able to jump out of my seat means this film is a winner.",/review/rw1388579/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2005,jimboduck,7," Shock Value -- 7 (Good Flick)
","You know that feeling you get when you're watching America's Funniest  Home Videos and the oblivious son hits his hapless father in the crotch  with an aluminum bat? It gets a quick reaction, like, ooh, I feel your  pain man.  FINAL DESTINATION 2 is a 90 minute or so string of those painful shots,  as each character one by one meets an unfortunate death by household  appliance. Bodies are slammed by trucks, heads are impaled, and limbs  fly through the air. When one of the characters dies when her car's  airbag explodes out of nowhere, I blurted ""Yeah! Wow, did they do  that??? Yeah, they DID do that. Right on!""  Although the film has a very serious atmosphere about it, what with the  creepy score and people sincerely freaking out and everything, it still  retains a campy humor about it buried beneath its high-budget exterior.  Many movies would shy away from smashing up plastic ketchup-filled  dummies, opting instead to avoid the gore. Not FINAL DESTINATION 2!  This movie is an honest approach to movie-making, hearkening back to  the day when you got together with friends and said, ""Okay, in this  scene we cut to the dummy falling off the building, it's run over by a  Mack truck, and it splatters chunks of blood all over that Oldsmobile  over there.""  As for the premise behind FINAL DESTINATION 2, how do I put it into  words? A.J. Cook has premonitions that people died in a nasty pileup on  the highway. Thing is, this never happened. And ... she continues to  have premonitions that those same people will die in due time. Those  people eventually die. Did I get that right? The universal law of  nature is that, well, Death sometimes misses its mark and has to fix  its mistakes (which usually involves electrical equipment getting wet  and other freak accidents of home improvement). If this all sounds  convoluted, watch the movie. You'll see what I mean.  The premise of FINAL DESTINATION 2, as much potential as it might have,  doesn't make much sense and is pretty hokey, but if you medicate your  inquisitive mind with heavy sedatives, you'll be able to look past the  flimsy premise and enjoy the movie. I'm definitely looking forward to a  Final Destination 3.",/review/rw1388579/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you liked ""Final Destination"" you'll really like ""Final Destination 2"". I remember the commercials for this one and was afraid they were ruining the thrill of this sequel.

17 May 2005,christian123,5," Very entertaining and better than the original
","Final Destination 2 is a very entertaining sequel and while the story is weaker then the first, the deaths are better. Kimberly (A.J. Cook) is a normal teen who is taking a road trip to Daytona with her 3 friends. She has a vision of a horrific traffic accident and so she blocks some of the cars from entering the highway. Sure enough they vision comes true and they have all just escaped death. Kim visits Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), the only survivor of Flight 180 who is convinced to help out the survivors of Route 23. Alex, who died between films, had been hit in the head with a falling brick. Kim, Clear and other strangers that are left must try to stick together and cheat Death again. The plot may sound stupid but its actually not all that bad. The story may not make sense at some scenes and the story is filled with holes. Its hard though to write a good story for something like this and I think they gave a good effort. The first film was very good and a lot of fun to watch. The sequel is even more fun to watch, even if it does get silly at times. Its better to watch the original before watching this so it would be easier to follow the story. Most horror films today are to silly to take serious and that's why you shouldn't really approach this one expecting an Oscar quality film. The acting was decent with the best being Ali Larter. She and Tony Todd are the only stars returning from the original film. A.J. Cook plays Kimberly and she does an okay job. The rest of the cast are mostly unknowns and aren't worth mentioning. David R. Ellis directs and he does really good job. He also directed the fast paced and exciting Cellular. The film is very gory and also very fun. Final Destination 2 was very creative when it came to killing off the characters. A couple of the death scenes do go over the top though the film delivers the goods for the most part. The film is only 90 minutes long so it's a quick film to watch. The movie also never gets boring as its always entertaining. I wouldn't say the film is to scary but there are some moments that may leave with fear. In the end, this is a very good sequel, that's better then the original and worth checking out. I just hope Final Destination 3 is just as good or even better then this film. Rating 7.8/10, check this film out as its very entertaining.",/review/rw1388579/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2020,rivertam26,9," Superior film to the original
",This really surprised me. Initially when I first saw it I thought there was no way they'd be able to do a sequel. This one in my opinion is the best of the bunch. It all starts off with the most insane scene ever. A giant accident on the highway that's let's the audience know all the different ways you can die. Like the first someone has a vision but this time around it's a young woman who ends up stopping traffic and saves a group of strangers who of course begin to die in the spectacularly gruesome ways. The death setpieces are ridiculously impressive a combination of practical and digital effects. My favorite has to be the glass kill but all of them are remarkable and hella shocking. The movie unlike the original doesn't take itself seriously and neither should you but it also impressively lays out a complex twist that brings it all together. A superior film to the first with solid performances all around.,/review/rw1388579/?ref_=tt_urv

Kirk, Justina Machado, David Paetkau, Tony Todd. On par with its predecessor this sequel to the smash horror hit continues a year later with Larter as the sole survivor who aids another group of doomed fate testers when Cook stops their predestined traffic accident (and boy is it a doozy; one for the film vault in its violently affective execution) leading Death to stalk them one by one in a variety of grisly misfortunes along the way.  Faster paced and inventively designed accidents' (thanks to screenwriters Jeffrey Reddick, Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber) make for a breathless entertainment one should be ashamed to admit yet enjoy none-the-less with its thrills and shocks aplenty.  (Dir: David R. Ellis)",/review/rw1388579/?ref_=tt_urv

7 October 2022,IonicBreezeMachine,6," Final Destination 2 doesn't break too far from its predecessor, but it is a decent follow-up
","College student Kimberly Corman (A. J. Cook) sets off on the road for Daytona Beach with her friends when she has a premonition of a multicar pileup on the freeway before exiting the on-ramp. Kimberly blocks the on-ramp with her car and tries to tell police officer Thomas Burke (Michael Landes) of the pileup but it happens anyway but not before Burke pulls her out of the way of a speeding car carrier that kills her friends. While other survivors of the pileup are dubious of Kimberly's premonition, Burke is more inclined to believe her as he was involved in the cleanup of Flight 180 one-year prior which experienced similar circumstances. As survivors of the pileup begin dying off, Kimberly seeks help of the voluntarily institutionalized Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) who has isolated herself from anything and everything since the death of Alex Browning. But Kimberly has visions that could lead to them escaping death's plan.",/review/rw1388579/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2003,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7," More gory than the first, but not as good
","The director obviously thought that when making a sequel, everything has to be bigger and heavier. But bigger doesn't equal better, and it definitely isn't the case here. The death scenes are unnecessary gory, and only that; practically no build-up to the scenes, and little to no excitement. Unless you enjoy watching extremely bloody, gory death scenes, you won't like this movie. In fact, you will most likely hate it, unless you're a big fan of the genre, or of the first Final Destination. It's a huge gore fest, and probably made for(and maybe even by) fans of the old ""body-count"" movies, from the 1980's. It has very little realism; whereas the first Final Destination had some realism in the death scenes, this had little to none at all. As many other slasher movies, it has the little ""twist-in-the-end"" at the very end, but it is very weak, considering what it could have been. The first movie is a lot better, but if you *need* to watch a gory movie where you pretty much sit around and wait for people to die, this isn't the worst you can watch. But if the choice is between this and the first, I would definitely choose the first. 7/10",/review/rw1388579/?ref_=tt_urv

14 April 2012,hnt_dnl,8," FD2 is my favorite FD sequel!
","Film franchises have become a sort of curiosity for me. Like how a new film concept comes out with an original idea and somehow it blossoms into a popular series. The Saw movies are the first ones I noticed this happening with, where the first movie was so beloved and such a surprise hit that it demanded a flurry of sequels. Harry Potter and Twilight seemed more like ""planned"" franchises, while Saw was a surprise. In the vein of Saw is the Final Destination series of movies, of which I find a major guilty pleasure. While I still think the first one is the best, I really enjoyed this 2nd film in the series FINAL DESTINATION 2 (2003), which ironically seems to be overlooked amongst the sequels, but favor it over 3, 4, or 5, actually.",/review/rw1388579/?ref_=tt_urv

","In this case, more of the same, is not a bad thing. Basically the movie its plot is just the same as in ""Final Destination"", only with different characters and settings this time. I however feel that the Final Destination franchise is one of the few horror-movie franchises that can have multiple sequels, without loosing any of its power or originality. The concept of the movie can be used over and over again; a person has a vision of an upcoming accident which will lead to the death of several people. Thanks to that vision the person prevents himself/herself and others from dying. They cheat death but the death eventually catches up with them again, as every person that should had died during the accident, dies one by one.",/review/rw1388579/?ref_=tt_urv
