8 January 2017,WeyounsLastClone,8," Won't win any awards for innovation, but will surely entertain you and warm your heart!
","Sure, this isn't the most ground-breaking series ever. But it has a lot of heart, and I loved the cast and their interaction.",/review/rw3615139/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2017,josejaviersaritmontalvo,10," A different kind of relatable sitcom
","Every once in a while a sitcom comes around that really catches audiences attention. I think One Day at a Time is one that's really needed at this point in time. I was raised with a mix of Puerto Rican and Dominican culture and I grew up with a lot of the same customs used in this show. I think the characters are relatable regardless of race or ethnicity and a lot of the issues surrounding them are broad and multicultural. Sure it has its clich√© moments, but what's a sitcom without them. I would be really disappointed if Netflix were to cancel this one. Regardless of who watches it, I believe everyone can find something in it that's relatable to their own lives. It's a win for me.",/review/rw3615139/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2017,valyinagyerzsi,10," Really great show
","I think in the last couple of years this was definitely one of the best sitcoms I have watched. The show found a great balance between being funny, and yet tackling serious topics such as PTSD, sexism or coming out, having really great heartfelt moments, while handling the transition between light and somber very smoothly. The actors' portrayal is all amazing, and so are the characters and their arcs, especially the main three women. ",/review/rw3615139/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2017,mleesouth,10," really?
","after reading reviews on here, i am just totally flabbergasted. the first review that came up was horrible. this show is amazing. it is hilarious, and heart wrenching. the comedy is well timed and funny, the serious parts are meaningful and relate to my childhood. i can say that this show is worth watching and beautiful. i don't understand why anyone would discredit it. i cant wait for more. it is so meaningful and soulful. it shows love and family and a hilarious humor. i can only imagine that if someone gives this show a bad review, that they don't understand its underlying meaning and that makes me sad for them. it is one of the best shows i have seen in a long time and i will be anxiously awaiting the next season.",/review/rw3615139/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2017,emorri-82846,10," Love this show
","I started watching this show because I was bored and wanted to just have something on TV while I worked and found myself overcome with emotions. This show is amazing and I can't wait until the next season debuts. It kept me laughing, thinking, and even crying. It is a great series and the only negative thing I have to say is that there weren't enough episodes. Netflix could help me out a lot by adding 26 episodes a season instead of their typical 13. I watched the entire serious in a few short hours and now want to make sure that this show continues. In all honesty this show was more intriguing to me than many other Netflix sitcoms as well as some other shows like George Lopez.",/review/rw3615139/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2020,Sylviastel,8," Your favorite book is the Chamber of Secrets. Why can't you keep them?
","Norman Lear always had a knack in creating bonafide hits. While I am grateful for the reboot of one of my favorite sitcoms, ""One Day at A Time,"" has Penelope Alvarez (a divorced mother) living with her overbearing mother, Lydia (Rita Moreno) and her two teenage kids. It's set in Los Angeles, California and not Indianapolis, Indiana. I was glad to see Mackenzie Phillips return to the series. The character Schneider is back as the superintendent and best friend played by Todd Grinnell. Stephen Tobolowsky played Penelope's boss and doctor and Lydia's companion. I haven't seen much of the series only the two episodes from the fourth season. While I am always grateful for a Lear series, it doesn't feel much like one. Penelope is a bit affront about everything. She's no Bonnie Franklin who was much more subdued in the role. I don't know Justina Machado's background. Rita Moreno's Lydia is almost obnoxious and overly annoying at times. I love Moreno but I just wished the writers would take it a step back. Moreno is a larger than life performer who has won every award imaginable. Stephen Tobolowsky is barely used. The kids in the series don't seem well-developed for me. They're just a one-dimensional character to me. What I enjoyed about the original was the reality and the interaction among the cast. I'll keep watching and hoping that it will get better.",/review/rw3615139/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2019,angeloukorstjens,8," One of my favorite sitcoms
","I am half way trough season three and unlike some, I actually upgraded my rating. I love how political this show is becoming, concidering it's a sitcom. It's very uncommon to have gay characters portrayed in such a natural way. It also addresses how complicated heated topics like the definition of 'concent' are. I honestly think it's important to have a little laugh, once in a while, about extremely complex political topics, without losing track of what's important. I think this show does exactly that. The characters are ridiculous.. Of course. That's the whole point! Very entertaining show. Easy to watch.",/review/rw3615139/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2017,kayleighmorganmusic,9," For a sitcom, it's brilliant!
","I think the negative reviews here are thinking about Netflix's general output instead of the genre this show is meant for. I personally have never seen the original, but I find this to breathe new life into the typical family sitcom genre. It's tackling modern issues but is steeped in traditional family values and I think that's a very important aspect for a modern sitcom. It's styled in a very old school way, but thematically it is embracing all factors of humanity without pandering or talking down to the audience, and I value that as a viewer. If you compare it to say House of Cards or OITNB then yes of course it won't stack up, but put it against 8 Simple Rules or Fresh Prince Of Bel Air and it does very well.",/review/rw3615139/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2020,myronlearn,2," Bad Remake
","I'm always dubious about remakes but on occasion they're as good if not better than the original. That's not the case with this dreadful sitcom. Moved from Indianapolis to a boring LA setting, it becomes a cookie cutter production almost from jump street. They should have kept the original venue. The writing is way below par and despite some great actors associated with 'One Day' even they can't steady this sinking ship despite their best efforts. It should be a lot better than it is.",/review/rw3615139/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2018,bettycjung,8," Great Cast, but Rita Moreno steal every scene she's in
","1/30/18. Just finished watching the 2nd season of this great sitcom about a 3-generation Cuban family dealing with life. Moreno is the mother of a divorced daughter raising a tween son and a gay teen daughter. The entire cast is great and the writing is super. Great story lines that go somewhere. But, just be aware that Moreno will steal every scene she's in because she just has the charisma to do it. At 87, this EGOT phenom still has it all.",/review/rw3615139/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2020,kzkybx,6," Entertaining, but preachy
","Good writing and a few touching and moving episodes. Funny and entertaining. Once in a while it gets on its high horse and gets preachy with abundant lefty woke moments...other than that huge negative, it's the acting and writing shine.",/review/rw3615139/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2017,tabipha,3," Seemed OK at first, but then got worse
","I wasn't even going to watch the reboot at all since things like Fuller House just sucked, but when I saw who some of the actors were, I thought I would give it a try. The first few episodes were OK, nothing great, but an OK thing to pass the time, but the whole character of Schneider was one of my favorite parts of the original series and if they were going to change the character so much, they should have changed his name like everyone else in the show!! The new one isn't funny, and he is in the show too much and the overuse of him shirtless is just annoying. I almost quit watching it cuz of all the stereotypical stuff they did with Lydia, but it really turned me off when they made Elena's life the biggest part of EVERY show after she came out, just like when Ellen came out and that was the ONLY thing ppl seemed to talk about. Alex's life became back burner to everything else that was going on and since the last few eps were all Elena-central, I am not going to even watch anymore. I kept watching cuz I thought it had to get better and it would focus some, for example, on Lupe's decision to go back to school and how that would affect the family, and the feelings and practicalities that would involve, how SHE just made the decision with no discussion when it would affect everyone and she didn't see her kids much, like she said, as it was. Instead, everyone was just totally OK with it, and IF you are going to make a show about today's issues, it would be nice to have more doses of reality in it. As for the whole quinces thing, there seems to be confusing info because I've seen and heard about them before but something was said on the show about it being a Cuban thing, but it ISN'T just a Cuban thing, which was intimated. There was a show on a few years ago called Cristela, that was about a family that originally came from Mexico, and it was written by the main character and it was FULL of stereotypes and racism, which there wasn't that much in this show except for Lydia, and thankfully ODAAT was much better than that, but it should NEVER have been called a reboot because it basically doesn't come even close to dealing with things like the original did!! Lear has let his standards go as has Netflix!! Sometimes, it takes me over half an hour to find something that is even halfway decent to watch that keeps my attention and with all the new stuff they put out, the pool is getting smaller instead of bigger. What happened to good, clean fun?!?",/review/rw3615139/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2017,kelseymolina,10," For the modern latinx
","As a Latina, it's incredible all the different ways I can see myself and my family in this show. The show is funny but also progressive. It's exactly what a Latinx show needs. These ideas aren't often portrayed in Latinx media and the fact that the show hits just about all the major topics on the head deserves so much credit. Feminism has such a bad rep, but this show puts a good face to it. It's finally a reboot that does exactly what it needs to do; It keeps the love of the original show, but adds modern changes not only physically, but also in their plot lines. It brings to light social issues that modern, popular shows don't touch upon. Truly worth the watch and features fantastic actors who take on their characters like themselves.",/review/rw3615139/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2018,ronfernandezsf,2," Too bad
","Only Rita Moreno is worth watching, otherwise skip it. The plots are stupid and the characters are dumb. How could a Doctor be so idiotic and have patients. Oh, he doesn't as none are ever seen. What kind of a practice does he have? Two dopey people work there but are only seen a couple of times. The Character of Snyder is ridiculous. So inane and unfunny. The kids do nothing but mug and are lousy actors. Everyones equity card should be revoked. The less said about our star Mother the better. Can't believe this type of programing is on the air. Had to watch the first season to see if it got better, but it all got worse. Poor Rita to be stuck in this mess.",/review/rw3615139/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2019,ronfernandezsf,2," over acted
","Situation is ok, but oh the acting is terrible. Don't know if its the characters or the writing or directing, but except for Rita Moreno, they are all over the top. Kids are atrocious, especially Elena. The Doctor is even worse. How could a professional Doctor be so stupid, inane and downright unbelievable. The less said about the Schnider actor the better. One moment he's crazy and the next very serious. If anything could be worse, it's the lousy laugh track. Come on folks, give it and me a break. Cannot watch much more of the hammy, over the top situations and acting. Hope these people save their money because they won't be doing much work in the future!!",/review/rw3615139/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2020,myronlearn,2," One Yawn At A Time
","The producers and writers 'California-ized' this show regrettably. The original, far superior series, took place in the heartland of Indiana. Why do they think that changing the venue improves the quality? Moving it to the West Coast was a major faux pax. The spark from the original series, despite the best efforts of the talented cast, sadly has been extinguished as a result.",/review/rw3615139/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2019,jtungsten16,10," This show is perfect!
","One Day At A Time really fires on all cylinders, it's entertaining with characters with real life situations and for some reason you get sucked it and really care about them. I know all shows must end, but 39 episodes of this series is not enough, I'd be satisfied with 100 but that would require the show to be on for like 8 more years considering each season only has 13 episodes. ODAAT has it all great actors, writing, directing and cinematography. Give this show a watch!",/review/rw3615139/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2019,esteban_guitierrez,1," If you can't do someting original...
","Modern films and TV shows have a recurring problem: they can't sell their liberal agenda on its own, so they take preexisting properties (Star Wars, Ghostbusters, Star Trek, Dr. Who, etc.) and ""reboot"" them using whatever cliches are hip in San Francisco and New York on that given week. This, because they know their ideas will fail unless they're associated with a beloved franchise or show. The shills will review them at 10/10 with broad-brush cliches and plenty of exclamation points!!!, which fools no one.",/review/rw3615139/?ref_=tt_urv

3 June 2020,Neko_Cat,3," For awhile, I enjoyed this show.
","At first, I was really enjoying this show. The occasional so called ""real life"" scenerio, the over the top teenage sjw, everything was okay then I got to the third season. I'm over it.

11 February 2019,Jonas2021,9," As Good as a Formulaic Sit-com Can Get
","One Day at a Time (ODAAT) is a throwback to the traditional, multi-camera sit-com of of the 70s, 80s, and 90s. Indeed, ODAAT is a reboot of the Norman Lear sitcom that debuted in the late 1970s. This reboot, however, is one of the few that may actually improve on the original (in its own way) while adapting to modern times, cultural diversity, and sexual identification politics, all the while, doing so sensitively.",/review/rw3615139/?ref_=tt_urv

","One Day At A Time, a classic Norman Lear series of the 70s and this Netflix reboot have one thing in common - the laugh track, and that is all.
