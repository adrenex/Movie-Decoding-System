10 October 2021,briancham1994,8," Great scenarios, but varies between episode
","Now that the first season is over, I can confidently say that this series has exceeded my expectations. It uses witty scripts and detailed animation to bring the fans the service they've been wanting and more. Each episode is quite varied so there are many different scenarios and you never know how it will turn out or which characters will show up. The series wastes no time explaining any of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and just gets to the point of the scenarios, and also starts to merge the scenarios without warning. This is for the fans, not casual viewers! However, the variety of episodes also means that the quality and tone also vary quite drastically. The short runtime means that many events and battles are cut short. There was a good amount of care to make everything canon and consistent, but there are still some shortcomings and the power/ability of each character seemed to be contrived based on the needs of the plot.",/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2021,ThomDerd,8," Cool series with interesting twists n tales.
",This is fun. I am enjoying every story.,/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2021,deepfrieddodo,6," Frustratingly Inconsistent
","A brilliant concept and a great way to view some alternative plots within the storylines that every Marvel fan knows, but horribly inconsistent. Some can lack any real power, Captain Carter not being too captivating although an interesting plot, T'Challa as Star Lord being a little too perfect, but others, like the murder of the Avengers are engrossing. It's just so disappointing that an episode such as Dr Strange losing his heart, which is poetic, powerful and beautiful, can be followed by the most disappointing Zombies episode imaginable. Zombies, was a particular waste.",/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2021,imperialwalkrnyr,9," Doctor Strange Episode...Wow
",Really enjoying this series & the risks they've taken so far.,/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2021,On_The_Mark,5," Amazing animation, absolutely awful writing
","Six episodes in, I have yet to be entertained by one. The concepts are awful. They're not interesting unless you're a die hard fan boy of Marvel comics. For the rest of us very casual fans, give us something. I've been bored on all six episodes I've seen so far and the seventh is what if Thor was an only child. So what?",/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2021,Swooping_Owl,10," Love it...Want More
","Now that I have seen all the episodes, I am still rating this 10 out of 10. I love the animation and different multiverse timeline stories. How it all came together in the end was brilliant. I will absolutely watch this numerous times. I really hope we get more seasons. Dr. Strange's episode was my favorite but I appreciate each episode for their brilliance, underlining meanings and symbolism.",/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2022,cjonesas,7," [7.1] Too much Disney fabric in it
","An animated series consisting of 9 nicely packed MCU ""parallel"" episodes, with two of them exceptional, episodes 4 and 8. That's a show for fans of the comics, easy on the eyes, fast-paced, some enthralling, some cringe-worthy, but overall satisfying.",/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2021,masterchibi-22046,5," This show misses its own point
",The show begins with a monologue about how single choice change events but none of the major changes were spawned by the inciting incident instead random changes were made that didn't make any sense and ultimately changed the First Avenger story into something that a crappy fanfic writer that never saw the movie but was told by a friend about it would write.,/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2022,UniqueParticle,9," Hits the spot after watching a lot of dark shows
","I barely use Disney plus but it's definitely worth it sometimes. What If...? Is magnificent for it's beautiful colors, brilliant possibilities and geeking out for the joys in life! I absolutely love the casts for the voices and everything related to Marvel universe is worth it. I can be completely satisfied for the Emmy's since I've seen a large bulk of the shows up for nominations. IMDb didn't use to require 600 characters that awkward for me since I generally don't make long reviews so stalling is fine I guess; a lot of great episodes to enjoy with the series. Perfect story with epic action to crave, the best aspect is how some of the same Marvel cast is involved in this!",/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2021,spidermonkeycoleman,8," People need to review the entire show instead of only 1 episode
",IMDB really needs to work on their audience review system. All the bad reviews are only for 1 episode and not the entire series. You can't judge an entire show on its first epiosde.,/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2021,KevinHartsRedheadedStepSon,6," Marvel, please take your cue from the original series!
","I really, really, really want to like this series! In fact, I want to love it! I love concepts that explore alternate realities and the like.",/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2021,pk1233,4," Just Not Interesting
","The concept was great, but the storylines they select are not interesting. Please tell me who on earth was wondering ""What If T'Challa were Star Lord?"" Or ""What If Hank Pym Assassinated the Avengers?""",/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2021,rghvvikas,7," Rated the first one with 6stars, increasing 1 star after each episode
","A very straight forward episode of rushing things to set those pieces right into the puzzle. And my facial expressions were also pretty straight watching this episode as there was no thrill or even a logical storytelling, I understand it's an aminated show targetted at children maybe? But only those children who are familiar with all the MCU till now might perhaps be able to enjoy it.",/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2021,Anurag-Shetty,9," Great series overall but, there's room for improvement.
","What If...? Tells the story of various Marvel Cinematic Universe films but, with 1 key twist in the tale that alters all the events that follow, leaving fans with brand new animated adventures with their favorite Marvel superheroes.",/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2021,doomedmac,7," Kinda dumb
","What If has plenty of good ideas and plenty of bad ones. The animation is quality but some of the voice acting is pretty terrible. As a Marvel fan some of the stuff really annoyed me. Still, it could be great.",/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2021,AnnaPagrati,10," Love it!
","I LOVE this show, honestly! Such interesting plot everytime, so easy to watch!",/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2021,zkmarkov,5," Poorly written for the most part
","Honestly questionable writing. Somehow if star lord was t'challa Thanos wouldn't be a villain. You're telling me that the most stubborn maniac in the universe changes his mind just because star lord is now from wakanda. I think it's just lazy writing for the most part. I know there's people that will like this a lot because it's quirky marvel stuff, and I thought I was going to like it, but honestly it's very meh.",/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2021,robertheduardoperezmachado,9," What if...what if is the best animated Marvel series ever?
","Okay, maybe it is, maybe it is not. In my opinion is the best, because it delivered in every aspect. Some episodes were quite boring, but at the end every episode had its meaning and relevancy. I loved the different stories, the sad endings and the fantastic Ultron. What a fantastic job from Marvel.",/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2021,alexglimbergwindh,5," What if.... MARVEL actually cared
",Loki.... What if.... When are they going to put in some heart in their productions?,/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2021,Wililjam,9," Animation took some getting used to...
","The animation of this show is great, though it did take some getting used to, but so far it has delivered some amazing shots.",/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2021,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,4," Um... what? (First Episode Review)
","Okay, right off the bat this episode SEEMED like it was going to work with The Watcher's opening narration, but it dissolved into fan-fiction self-indulgence the millisecond Steve Roger's Iron-Man suit came into play; that and the AWFUL dialogue being filled with one-liners that'd be in place for an action-adventure film parody like Last Action Hero and condensing Captain America's plot into a half-hour episode that felt like a network mandate rather than creative choice.",/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2021,DarkVulcan29,10," A lot better than expected
","Based on a marvel comic book series that answers the question, what if characters in the marvel universe lives went in a certain direction, and how would it affect the lives around them.",/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2021,andrewchristianjr,8," WONDERFUL.
","I really enjoyed it. Each episode was unique and interesting, the finale was wonderful. Looking forward to the next season. I like that the show explored some ideas and concepts, such as Zombies, that would not have been possible otherwise.",/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2022,iamjamalwhite,6," Meh, some good stuff but bad too
","There were high points but just as many low. And a zombie episode, that's just lazy writing. Half of them were cringe with the woke push. As someone who has read comic books since they were a dime, I wouldn't recommend this one.",/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2021,asterblasterth,5," So...after 9 episodes
","I am still not sure if I like it or not. On the one hand I like the potential of the show. On the other hand many episodes didn't satisfy me. They want to do too much in a short amount of time. They give you like a quick origins story, then some quick action around the topic of the show and then it's finished. They also wanted to be too 'woke' for my taste. In the last episode the assembled cast of characters doesn't make any sense to me for the task they had to do.",/review/rw7415704/?ref_=tt_urv
