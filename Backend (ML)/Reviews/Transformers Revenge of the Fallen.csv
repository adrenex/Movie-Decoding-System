6 March 2022,tanstorck,7," A Solid Mystery
","I've seen quite a few murder mysteries lately, so I'm glad this series does something different. By shaking up the murder mystery genre, each episode is...a different genre. Seeing a mystery unfold from different characters perspectives isn't entirely new, but the way it's presented in the show is. All the characters are pretty interesting and all have motive. The cast has great chemistry with each other. The show isn't quite excellent but it's a fun mystery to solve and I was genuinely surprised by the ending.",/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2022,adamsandel,8," The most ingenious, poorly promoted comedy of the year
","This is a funny, clever whodunnit with smart writing and an A-List ensemble of comic actors - but I had never heard of it - I am bombarded by trailers and promos for shows 24/7.",/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2022,cherold,8," Silly, hilarious murder mystery
","In The Afterparty, a murder is committed after a high school reunion and a cop tries to solve the case by listening to each suspects story, episode by episode.",/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2022,gridoon2023,8," Enjoyable, creative and offbeat series
","This series is somewhat similar to the recent ""Woman In The House Across The Street From The Girl In The Window"" in that it also has an eccentric sense of humor and marches to its own beat, switching genres from episode to episode (hint: pay attention to the opening animated sequence), not always giving the audience what they want, and sometimes ignoring the crime investigation part altogether. The quality varies from episode to episode, with 3 being thoroughly brilliant (I've watched parts of it several times; once is certainly not enough) and 7 being the weakest (perhaps the only time where a bold narrative choice does not quite pan out). Episode 1 is very sweet, episode 6 is very creative, and episode 8 proves how elaborately and carefully designed the whole mystery plot was. Overall the series is very enjoyable, and the whole cast works together beautifully: even minor characters like Indigo or Walt are great. I would 100% watch a second season made by the same people. Somewhere between a 7.5 and an 8 out of 10.",/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2022,cc0077,10," SO GOOD
","I'm still waiting for newer episodes to come out, but for now I love this show. The show just continues to get better and better throughout the episodes and I LOVE the comedic scenes. I also loved how we were able to hear every character's perspective of the story, and how scenes weren't just reused but actually filmed again depending on the character's perspective. I'm so excited for the next episodes!!!",/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2022,laqsheyo,7," Better than expected!
","This show is super fun to watch, likeable characters, detective lady is so cool y'all, no laughter track and clever jokes. Yasper (Ben) is my favourite character (for now). Ben schwartz was super awesome in Parks and Recreation too. Xavier is kinda like Justin Beiber. Can't wait for the 4th episode!",/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2022,bruno_dreamer,7," Two episodes in and i'm hooked
","It's a very specific kind of humour, and I totally get why people would find the cast annoying - and for me that's a positive point for the series. The exaggeration and campiness of it is part of the whole format, and I think it's a fresh breath of air. It's not easy to sustain a 45 minutes comedy, and I think this show does it well so far.",/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2022,ckmccabe,9," Great surprise
","This was an extremely pleasant surprise. Based on commercials this show didn't look great, but as a big fan of Lord and Miller I gave it a shot anyways. It was one of the better mystery stories I've seen: very well written, awesome cast, fantastic direction and change of genre per episode. Really enjoyed this and really can't go wrong with Christopher Miller.",/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2022,J-odishaw,8," Amusing, occasionally hilarious whodunnit comedy.
","Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, Ben Schwartz and Sam Richardson. I may be a little biased but anything these guys do has me on board. Its not for everyone, but Ben and Sam are seemingly allowed free reign with their ad libbed, improv style comedy. If this type of thing is at all your cup of tea you might enjoy it. Also Ike barenholtz is always a treat.",/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2022,DukeEman,7," A nightmare of an after party that we get to enjoy...
","The only school reunion ""after party"" I have ever been to was a boorish drunken fest. Since then I refused to attend school reunions of any sort. And this new series proves why. But at least The Afterparty is more entertaining.",/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2022,tkmce2008,8," Chris Miller gives us yet another entertainer that is extremely creative & fun to watch
","Christopher Miller's latest, The Afterparty premiered on everyone's new favourite streaming platform; Apple TV+ in January. Given its widespread acclaim, the show was renewed for a second season. This is the first time Miller is directing something solo (all of his previous work has been with Phil Lord).",/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2022,Joshumms,7," Good start!
","This show is pretty good so far! I think the strongest thing about the series is the storytelling switching genres each episode, it makes for a unique, fresh, and dynamic story each episode. The show is funny but the mystery isn't that interesting and there are some annoying characters. Sometimes the genre switching works against it and restricts how funny the episode can be. The constant flashbacks also sometimes worsen the pacing of the show but they do a decent job of building the characters. Overall the show fluctuates between interesting and funny and never really achieves both perfectly, but it's still enjoyable and worth watching. The season finale was very very good and the show is absolutely worth watching for the ending.",/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2022,lnmilne-64111,10," So Fun
",First time I've seen Tiffany Haddish and she was great. Tuned in for Ben Schwartz (Solo Bolo!) and Sam Richardson...stayed for the writing and the whole cast. Great concept and a great season!,/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2022,drpainters,8," Very solid
","Very solid series. Each episode was fresh and not redundant telling same story. Didnt know who Dunn it until the very end. Each episode had a different tone, really enjoyed the musical episode, definitely worth the watch.",/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2022,alanjohnpeach,8," Strong pilot
","Basically this ticks a lot of boxes
Murder Mystery you can't immediately know the answer to? Check
Half decent comedy love triangle (rectangle?)
Some really good comedic actors you love from other things.",/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2022,somethingreal81,2," Skip this party
","I forced myself to sit through two episodes before finally turning this off. Not only did I not laugh even once, but everything about this show is just trying waaay too hard. The result was a show that's not just unfunny, but actively annoying.",/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2022,jjworsley,10," Genuinely Surprised
","This was genuinely one of the most entertaining programmes we've seen in awhile and we watch 1000's of programmes. The comedy in it was just right and not overly stupid, the direction and scenes created and filmed were done well, with great writing to boot. Just really surprised me, compared to the ever growing rubbish dumps that Hollywood seems to be putting out these days.",/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2022,jkeitz,9," Another Apple TV Hit!
","To begin with, this is an amazing concept, not just a take on the different POV story telling, but to take each and craft it into a separate genre really makes this a hit! Every one of the characters is well crafted and extremely well acted, well except for one. The only let down here is the highly overrated Tiffany Haddish. She's not particularly bad, just she's nowhere near as good as the rest of the cast, so there is a bit of a needle scratch whenever the scene veers back to her. Still, it is a solid 9 star series which could have been a 10 with a better lead.",/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2022,dee_uson,10," Love, hate, love it
","Love the series so far (first 3 episodes down)! It's everything I thought it would be based on the previews, and I am enjoying it! I prepared myself mentally that it would be a little cheesy, theatrics with a dash of huh??? And down right silly who dun it investigative antics by Haddish and was not the least bit disappointed. Sometimes I just have to set my expectations at zero and let myself build up to it to really enjoy a film. I'm a fan!!!",/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2022,TheTruthofItIs,2," Afterparties are supposed to be memorable
","""The Afterparty"" (S01, 8 eps, 30+ mins, Apple) is just agonizing to sit through. I suppose they're trying to perform a murder mystery comedy but those two are at odds in this low-budget production. I tried to power through two eps as it beat on me with its slow pacing, stale comedy, man it was just boring! ""Game Night"" worked much better than this.",/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2022,anasnoops,8," Such fun ! A whodunnit to chill after OD on true crime podcasts !
",I have enjoyed the first 3 episodes. The use of the point of view of each character in each episode makes up for entertaining TV with so many great comedic actors in the mix. Great to chill out & enjoy the ride.,/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2022,007Waffles,1," Avoid this reunion...
","I only watched the first episode and it was rough! The first episode had this grimy, awkward feeling throughout. The premise is lame, the dialogue is terrible, and the acting is bad. I don't care about what happened or what happens next. The detective acts like she is a high school reporter working on her blog and her partner is a joke. Speaking of jokes, the jokes are stupid and not funny. The writing is bad and there isn't enough of a story to make a series out of it. Which is why the same story repeats in each episode. I wouldn't be surprised if the guy jumped just to get out of this show.",/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2022,chikken7,10," Highlight of my week!!
","This show is AMAZING. The concept is brilliant, and the whole thing is beautifully presented. I'm really enjoying watching the conversations from all the different angles, especially ones that are incidental in one story but vital in another (but not the same conversation!). The whole cast is excellent, but Ben Schwartz is simply brilliant as always.",/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2022,douglasmiller-84793,2," Ugh
",I can only imagine the producers watching the clips come in and contemplating an eternity watching this show. It's terrible. It's terrible raised to the power of unfunny garbage.,/review/rw7826554/?ref_=tt_urv
