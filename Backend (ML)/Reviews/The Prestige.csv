22 August 2019,Jester222,5," Somewhere amongst this confusing and disjointed film is a fantastic film trying it's best to get out.
",This film had so much potential. Great cast and the story could have been really good but it ended up a disjointed mess of a film.,/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2019,ferdmalenfant,8," I really enjoyed it!
","No one pays me for ratings and I can tell you that I rarely find these little gems. The acting is very solid all around. The plot is just twisted enough but not confusing and keeps you wondering right up to the end. This is definitely a ""Thriller"" worthy of the label.",/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2020,Sleepin_Dragon,6," Decent enough.
","It's not a bad thriller, it starts off well, has a decent enough ending, but the middle of the film is somehow slightly confusing. You will need to concentrate, otherwise the narrative will pass you by.",/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2019,SnoopyStyle,5," too many things
",Young women go missing in Minnesota. A serial killer is hunting. Michael Cooper (Ben Kingsley) is a retired judge who turned vigilante after the murder of his family.

Rachel (Alexandra Daddario) is the new investigator for the unit. Lara gets caught up by serial killer Simon (Brendan Fletcher).,/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2022,FlashCallahan,6," Talk about losing the plot! Both narratively and literally...
","On the hunt for an elusive serial rapist and murderer, cop Marshall crosses paths with vigilante duo Cooper and Julia as they trap online predators and deliver their own extreme methods of justice.",/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2020,deloudelouvain,8," How can you think this is a bad movie, it's the opposite, I really liked it.
","Nomis or Night Hunter, call it whatever you want, I liked it a lot. I don't get why you would have two different titles for a movie, it's not the first time that I came across that, and I always wonder why they do that, what's the point? What I don't get either is that there are people that thought this movie was terrible. Terribly good yes! I love movies where there is a lot of mystery, the kind where you try to figure out what's going on, who did what and so on. Nomis has it all, it's the kind of movie where you constantly think you know what happened or what will happen, only to discover you're completely wrong at the end. I really thought I had this one figured out so the twists and turns in this one were really good, much better than a ""normal"" good movie. The cast did a good job playing their characters, especially Brendan Fletcher and Henry Cavill. If you like psychopath crime stories with a twist just watch this one. Don't listen to the negative reviews, they have no clue what they are talking or writing about.",/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2019,confidential-67897,4," Waste of a talented cast
","Terrible directing and even worse editing, almost like it was their first job after college.
Script made no sense what so ever.
And why chose an actor to play a washed up cop who looks like he spends 4 hours a day inn the gym?",/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2019,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," Such a shame for a missed golden opportunity
","This story (premise) had such opportunity to be a great film, but I guess the budget went more towards the top-billed cast, than in the production.",/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2019,plasticanimalz,8," Suspenseful and Entertaining
","I watch and listen to a lot of true crime, and was surprised to find this, given I'd never heard of it. It not only met but exceeded my expectations. It was suspenseful, twisty, and great acting, particularly by the bad guy. Henry Cavill is surprisingly brooding, and did a good job as the cop whose seen too much. Alexandra Daddario...well, she's likable and nice to look at. All around good story, cast, suspense, directing, and kept me glued to my seat. And the opening scene was eerie and really starts the movie off creepy, sucking you in.",/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2019,michaelseither,7," Over the Top, Crazy Fun, Serial Killer Flick
","Rotten Tomatoes didn't like it much and there is talk of a hold-up in the release of this flick. I thought it was pretty good. If you like Silence of the Lambs type flicks and give it a willing suspension of disbelief, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Plenty of star actors, great production value and crazy, crazy script. There are some holes here and there but hey, it was fun. Give it a chance.",/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2019,phd_travel,2," A murky and improbable mess
",How did such a badly written and directed movie get made let alone attract such a top notch cast? I know actors have to take roles when they can get them but this is so bad. The story tries to be shocking but just seems stupid.,/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2019,brucebigelow-10873,4," Ridiculous
","One of the main protagonists goes around castrating sex offenders who haven't been convicted. Do they arrest him? Nope, apparently that's legal in... I guess they're pretending it's Minnesota. From there it's a series of totally incompetent events by the police. Oh, there's a bomb. We need to get everyone out of the building except the prisoner we're holding. And apparently if you put a tracker in a teddy bear you can pull out a wire and it becomes the tracker. Good to know in case you ever find a tracking device. Also you can sneak up on unsuspecting police officers in thin wood in the snow because... oh right, they're completely incompetent.",/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2019,redrobin62-321-207311,6," Okay Film. Brendan Fletcher As The Oddball Was Worth The Price Of Admission, Though.
","Gandhi and Superman couldn't save this movie - and they were in it! They just seemed detached and were just going through the motions for the paycheck. Plus, the story wasn't that great to begin with, so I suppose they had to make do with what they were given. The young Canadian actor I'd never heard of before, Brendan Fletcher, did a good job as the weird guy. It reminded me of the first time I saw Ed Norton in his first film, Primal Fear. He was really believable in that movie, so much so that he was even nominated for an Academy Award for it. I really thought Ed Norton was mentally challenged in real life, like Giovanni Ribisi in The Other Sister. This movie is really a '5'. The additional point was for Fletcher.",/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2019,Lejink,3," Hunt the hunters
","A confusing, contrived and ultimately uninvolving would-be thriller centring on an apparent long-term serial abducter and killer of young women. It starts off with his latest victim attempting escape in the freezing dead of night, only to end herself when he catches her up. Next, we're introduced to a pretty young girl honey-trapping a convicted rapist now out of jail, her accomplice and the calculating brains of the operation being an elderly former judge with money and clout enough to extract full retribution for the helpless perpetrator's victims by castrating him, clearing out his bank account to share the proceeds with the victims and have him sign a full waiver statement for what's happened to him.",/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2021,kosmasp,9," Hunting
",The cast of this movie is ... exceptional. And that is putting it mildly. It also feels like it has the plots of two different movies - and by combining them putting all sorts of hunters against each other. One may say there are more than you could possibly deal with (no pun intended). Sir Ben Kingsley and Tucci in one movie - that's a treat. Even if they don't really have that many scenes together.,/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2019,Fella_shibby,6," Engaging n suspenseful uptil the revelation.
","Brendan Fletcher's acting is the highlight.
Similar like Aamir Khan's from Dhoom 3.
The cat n mouse game between the inmate n the cops is thrilling like Law Abiding Citizen.
The film is about a person (Fletcher) held in police detention for the abduction n murders of several girls.
He is caught with the help of a vigilante (Kingsley), who sterilises pedophiles n rapists. They shud have focused more on the character of Ben Kingsley.
The film has shades of Dhoom 3, Primal Fear, Law Abiding Citizen, etc.
Alexandra Daddario looked way too beautiful to be a cop/profiler.",/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2019,wisemanfromtowne,2," What a mess.
","The only part in the film I want to address is why would a law enforcement officer help let a serial rapist escape from a holding cell, because his baby was abducted and second the story doesn't even address it? WTF? Overall a very incoherent mess of a film. Another depiction of how inept law enforcement really is. A very poorly written story",/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2019,lavatch,5," Kingsley Shines in Average Thriller
","""Night Hunter"" was a decent action picture, whose strength was Ben Kingsley's portrayal of a vigilante named Cooper, who works with his tag-team partner Lara to apprehend predators.",/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv

",Night Hunter (1 out of 5 stars).,/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2019,westsideschl,8," Spot On for All the Basics
","1. Creative, not seen before storyline, take on what would have been the standard serial killer of young women plot.
2. Acting was disturbingly offbeat, and spot on.
3. Interesting unique roles especially the vigilante assemblage/posse.
4. Dialogue at times intelligent; at times unexpected.
5. Sets; props; location, particularly the seldom seen Manitoba angle, were all no-nonsense edgy.
6. Twisty denouement - got me.",/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2019,ztigr,3," Great cast play dumb cops. Do these decisions make sense?
","What a waste of a solid cast. I am becoming so tired of lazy writers using dumb decisions by cops to forward the story line. Barney Fife was a character from Mayberry, not your typical homicide detective in a big city. On that note, here are the truly moronic actions of these cops you might consider for your own screenplay:
1) Never have an ambulance backing up any crime scene
2) Park your car where criminals have easy access to it
3) Have hero visit multiple crime scenes without backup
4) Don't secure a mass murderer during a bomb scare
5) Enter an interrogation room with a suspect that has physical superiority over you, uncuff him and then start prodding him into violence
6a) Despite numerous instances of cops involved with the case being targeted, don't be proactive in protecting families, just continue to react
6b) Prioritize outwitting the media and sneak the criminal out of the back of the building with only a couple of cops as escort.
6c) Make sure all the other cops are nowhere in the vicinity when your transport vehicle does get predictably ambushed, so they cannot respond in time to be of any assistance.
7a) Let your criminals consistently outflank you and get the drop on you when you are pursuing them. Though your criminals have no guns to begin with, they are able to obtain weapons and then systematically shoot every cop within striking distance
7b) and in the one instance you do get the drop on the bad guy with his back turned, allow him to turn around and shoot you dead center before you are able to even get a shot off, this with the guy standing on ice mind you, the sturdiest of footings
8) Have criminals die in the stupidest way possible of their own making, Aren't you clever for thinking of this unique way to do away with them? Bonus moron points for you!
9) Only send a handful of cops to take out the criminals even though they have killed at least 10 cops and dozens of other victims. Because we never see cops overreact in real life do we?
10) Don't really give criminals enough background story to understand why they are the way the are. Leave that to the audience to be bewildered by.",/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2019,ok-patrick,4," Disjointed and incoherent
","Quite hard to follow the script and flow of the action, jumping from scene to scene was a mess at the very least. Hardly invested in any of the characters despite the star-studded cast which was mediocre in their performances at best. Sorry director and editor, better luck next time.",/review/rw5356512/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2021,Rodrigo_Amaro,2," A Lousy Thriller
