27 March 2019,hitchcockthelegend,6," Divisive Dilemas.
","Have to be honest, I had no idea this was filmed on an iPhone 7 or that it was directed by Steven Soderbergh. I was stuck for something to watch on cable the other night and I liked the sound of the plot premise. So unburdened by expectation of a searing horror classic I settled in to see what unfolds.",/review/rw4109191/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2018,TheLittleSongbird,7," Both unsettling and uneven
","'Unsane' seemed to me like it had real potential to be a good film. It looked intriguing, it was interesting to see how it would fare being shot on an IPhone (though part of me was a little apprehensive, being concerned it would be handled amateurishly), the trailer looked great, like Claire Foy a lot and the idea was for me one of the best and most unique of the year.",/review/rw4109191/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2018,ccamp89,3," As a psychiatrist and a film lover, I was highly disappointed.
","As someone who works in the mental health field, the first act of this movie excited me. The set up seemed to suggest a film that would attempt to capture the experience of a psychotic individual who finds herself involuntarily committed; to convey the confusion and desperation of such an experience for the patient, and perhaps the callousness of the staff who have become so jaded to such a presentation that they fail to meet the emotional needs of that patient. I felt genuinely uncomfortable through the first 20-30 minutes of the film as this scenario was explored, so much so that it forced me to reflect on my own experiences with psychotic patients and how important it is not to lose that level of empathy regardless of how routine the work may become. Furthermore, I was tantalized by the possibilities of the film in blurring the line between delusion and reality, expecting it to keep me questioning what was real and what wasn't.",/review/rw4109191/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2018,Jared_Andrews,6," Plenty of Promise, but is ultimately a bit Unsatisfying
","With most of Steven Soderberg's movies, he tells stories in a way that makes viewers unsure of what exactly is going on. Unsane is like that. The title indicates that the main character might be insane but also might not be insane. ",/review/rw4109191/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8," A gripping thriller that expertly puts you in the shoes of its protagonist.
","While its grammatically-challenged title is just as likely to test your sanity as anything in the film itself (perhaps by design, I'll add), Steven Soderbergh's second return from retirement seeks to 'change the game' and prove that you don't need a proper camera or fancy lighting to make a film, just an iPhone, a decent script, a competent cast and crew and, most importantly, the will, time, money and passion to do it all. Luckily, 'Unsane (2018)' has all that in spades. It could easily pass for something shot on one of those fancy cameras and actually has a tangible and, appropriately, an almost 'followed-around-with-a-camera' stalker vibe to it. It's a wonderfully frustrating, rewardingly claustrophobic and tensely insular experience that sticks you right in the slightly off-kilter head of its protagonist and does a great job of making you feel exactly the way she does at every moment. The pace is almost perfect, as we're dealt a number of blows every time we begin to get comfortable in each new situation, and the slow descent from slightly strange to straight-up sinister is a palpable and uncomfortable one. The fact that the sanity of the hero is called into question is a great move, though it isn't pushed quite as far as it perhaps could have been, and it keeps you unsure about everything you see. The nods back to classic seventies horror, including a soundtrack reminiscent of 'Halloween (1978)', were appreciated as well. I was constantly on the edge of my seat throughout this gripping, agitating, intriguing and generally very entertaining thriller. 8/10",/review/rw4109191/?ref_=tt_urv

This is a good movie, even if some of the details are a little shady or generous in their application. Claire Foy gives a strong performance, and there is just enough haziness to make you wonder if she is, or isn't, sane. And she's got a great name:Sawyer Valentini! Good ending too!

","This review won't state anything someone else hasn't said more eloquently, but by god I have to add my own to the reviews because of my disgust with the decently high rating despite an awful , incomprehensible, and unbelievable plot. The movie starts out well with the viewer uncertain about what is real and what may be a delusion we are seeing from the protagonist's point of view. Then after a very drawn out and tedious key scene, it falls apart, combusts, and you are left with the ashes flying into your face wondering how anyone did or said any of the things they did.",/review/rw4109191/?ref_=tt_urv

30 May 2018,Max_Lucas,4," Mostly good in theory.
","Shot on iPhone, I had no idea. Acting, I felt was good. Believable truth about insurance. Being involved in those situations. I can confirm. Once your insurance runs out, BAM, you're cured, and let out.
 As for the stalker, stupid addition. Yet without it, the movie wouldn't be as good. He had no involvement in her commitment. And he happens to be the pharmacist at the psych ward? Not fired after dispensing a bad cocktail. ( And her for even taking anything her would give her. Didn't even count how many pills?) Video cameras being shut off for long periods of time. A patient gone missing all day and no one noticed? Even shoving a cell phone with a picture of a bloodied missing patient didn't raise any questions. I could go on and on. Couldn't they just spend a little more time fixing the story to be more believable? Again, not a bad movie. Just tired of watching movies that start of being realistic and believable to let's just rush this out the door and get paid. C'mon guys, take the extra step.",/review/rw4109191/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2018,Alexander_Blanchett,8," First iPhone movie with many surprises!
","Steven Soderbergh is back with a film that is shot with an iPhone camera. But it totally suited the atmosphere of the film and actually was able to show the characters closer and without any effects to make them better than they are.. it allows a much deeper look into their souls. Claire Foy is brilliant. She totally plays the opposite character to her ""The Crown"" role. And she could not have been any better. Raw. Honest. Just great. Now I am really looking forward to her turn as ""Lisbeth Salander"". She plays a woman that seemingly is wrongly put into a mental hospital. Steven Soderberghs nicely plays with the audience and permanently asks the question is she rightly there or indeed insane?
Its a stalking drama that turns into a mystery thriller until it reaches its point as a horror film. Three genres Soderbergh perfectly mixes.
Next to Foy shine Amy Irvine and Joshua Leonard. With good support by Juno Temple and Jay Pharoa.
The film is simply shot but still feels like a typical cinematic film. It has a great score and very good editing. The only problem was the screenplay, while generally good and inspired, it had a few too many holes that prevented the film from being a real masterpiece. But its good and I am already looking forward to see it again. Oh and watch out for a great surprise cameo of one of Soderbergh's regulars!",/review/rw4109191/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was probably instantly attracted to seeing this film from the unusual but clever title, I read more about it as it got closer to its release date, and then there were positive comments from critics, so hoped for something good, Steven Soderbergh (Sex, Lies, and Videotape; Traffic, Ocean's Eleven, Side Effects). Basically Sawyer Valentini (The Crown's Claire Foy) is a bright but troubled businesswoman, she has become successful in her new position and maintains healthy relationships with her co-workers. But she has become distant from her mother Angela (Amy Irving) since moving away, it is revealed that she actually moved to escape a stalker who had been terrorising her for two years. Sawyer seeks a support group for victims of harassment, she has an initial consultation at the local hospital, during which she confesses that she has contemplated suicide in the past. Sawyer is given documents to sign, she is confused when she is asked to hand over her belongings and change into a hospital gown, Nurse Boles (Polly McKie) tells her that she has signed a consent form, committing her to spend 24 hours in the hospital's psychiatric ward. Sawyer calls the police, but they are unwilling to intervene, as they get calls like hers all the time, her situation is worsened when she has an aggressive argument with fellow patient Violet (Juno Temple), and she attacks an orderly, mistaking them for her stalker, her stay is upgraded to a week. Sawyer is horrified to discover that one of the orderlies is her stalker, David Strine (Joshua Leonard), he has obtained a job at the asylum to get close to her, her outbursts and protesting cause her to be considered mentally unstable, so she is repeatedly sedated and given drugs. At one point, David intentionally gives her an overdose of pills, causing her to become disorientated and violent, the nurse notices to error, but does not recognise that it was deliberate. Sawyer is cold towards the orderlies and other patients, but she warms to recovering opiate addict Nate Hoffman (Jay Pharaoh), he knows that the hospital and its parent company are committing clinically sane people to extort money from insurance companies. Sawyer tells how she met David, it was whilst working with an Alzheimer's patient when she volunteered at a hospice facility, David was his son, when David's father died, he became obsessed with Sawyer, fanatically texting her and even breaking into her house. Nate has a smuggled cell phone that Sawyer notices him using, he allows her to use it to call her mother, Angela is determined to help her daughter get out. But the police, and her lawyer, are unwilling to help, due to the consent form, it is suggested they wait for the week to end, after which the hospital are legally obliged to release her. David notices Nate and Sawyer spending time together, during the night David knocks Nate unconscious and tortures him in the basement, before injecting and killing him with an overdose of fentanyl. The orderlies believe Nate's death was caused by his drug addiction, David taunts Sawyer, sending her images of the bloodied Nate, in another act of aggression she scolds Violet with hot coffee, she is placed in solitary confinement. While in solitary, Sawyer is repeatedly visited by David, she is initially aggressive towards him, berating and mocking him for his lack of sexual experience and unrealistic fantasies about them being together, this causes him to break down in tears, and he attempts to strangle her. On his next visit, David tells Sawyer that he hacked into the hospital's computer system with false information, they believe that she has been released, he suggests that they should run away together to a log cabin he has renovated. Seeing an opportunity to escape, Sawyer convinces David to have sex with Violet in front of her to prove himself, he drugs Violet and brings her to solitary, Sawyer grabs Violet's contraband weapon and stabs David, she flees, while David in rage breaks Violet's neck. Sawyer escapes the hospital, but David catches up, knocks her out and puts her in the car trunk, along with the corpse of Angela, who he killed earlier. Sawyer manages to break out and escape, David catches up again and breaks her ankle with a hammer, but Sawyer managed to grab her mother's crucifix, she stabs David in the eye with it, and finally cuts his throat. The police eventually show up, they realise that David had been using a stolen identity after finding the corpse of the man he killed to gain access to the hospital, and it is revealed that Nate was an undercover investigative journalist, his notebook detailing criminal activities lead to the arrests of the staff. Six months later, Sawyer has recovered and is having lunch with a colleague, but then she sees a man she thinks is David sitting at another table in the restaurant, she grabs a knife and approaches, but realises she is delusional, she runs out, she glances behind and it ends on a freeze frame, clearly her nightmares will continue. Also starring Aimee Mullins as Ashley Brighterhouse, Sarah Stiles as Jill and Matt Damon as Detective Ferguson. Foy does give a great performance and is the best thing about the film, being sarcastic and occasionally nasty, in a good way, special mention should go to the terrific support of Temple as a wild-child patient, and the cameo from Damon is a bit daft and badly timed. Mark Kermode made comparisons to the Samuel Fuller classic Shock Corridor, I can see why, being set in a mental institution, it starts out as fairly plausible and intriguing, you do feel sympathy for the leading character, then it just goes far-fetched and over the top, I wanted to like it a bit more, overall it is a very average psychological horror thriller.

","As soon as I heard about this film I was super excited. That's always the case when there is a new Steven Soderbergh film out. Definitely a solid filmmaker who is consistent and fairly innovative. Loved his recent Side Effects and Logan Lucky. This seemed like a different take in the vein of Shutter Island and a bit like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. I also liked the style of filming that was immediately visible from the trailer. After seeing this film, I'm happy to say I actually liked it a lot.

18 September 2018,rolandjordaan2,8," Unsane - Spoiler Free Review
","Surprisingly effective psychological thriller stars Claire Foy as Sawyer Valentini, a woman who moves 900 miles away from her home town of Boston to escape an obsessed stalker. While consulting a psychiatrist, Sawyer gets herself inadvertently committed to a mental clinic, the same clinic where her stalker may or may not be employed at. This movie was a lot better than I ever could have expected; although her character lacks likeability, Claire Foy does manage to create sympathy for a woman who has simply been dealt a really bad hand in life. She plays the part just right and actually manages to keep the viewers guessing whether her claims are true or just delusions of her own insanity. Joshua Leonard (from 'The Blair Witch Project') is equally effective as the man accused by her of being her stalker; he plays his character calm at all times, making him effectively creepy.
The tone of the film is extremely dark and unsettling, and makes good use of it's limited locations. The script is well written, with effective dialogue and plot elements keeping it moving at a brisk pace with enough twists and turns to keep almost anyone's interest. At the core, this does remain a stalking film, but as far as stalking films go, this is about as original as one can possibly expect. Highly recommended.",/review/rw4109191/?ref_=tt_urv

","Another 'look at me' movie from Soderbergh. This was entirely filmed and edited on his Iphone 7, but that's not really an impressive feat when he has a huge budget and Hollywood clout behind him and the likes of Matt Damon agreeing to do tiny cameos. This was shot in ten days and it looks it, with Claire Foy carted off to a fake-feeling insane asylum and forced to confront a guy who's been stalking her. I was pleased to see Joshua Leonard again some twenty years after his BLAIR WITCH debut but this ends up full of the usual tedious heart-searching conversations and feels contrived throughout.",/review/rw4109191/?ref_=tt_urv

","Unsane came out on Friday to some mixed reviews from critics and audiences all over the world and finally after lots of digging for cash, I finally got to see this anticapated film! The film follows a young woman, played by Claire Foy who is institutionalized into a sanatariom after she fills out a few therapy papers and soon enough she then finds out to make it worse that her mad stalker is now a member of staff and out to take her away so she can become his own. I was so excited to see Unsane because I loved the idea and it's awesome trailer and what did I think; weeeeell, apart from a few small differences then to what I expected, it was a awesome horror film. The acting was superb and it was very clever and very intense. Clare Foy was amazing as Valentino and so was Joshua (i forget his second name, but he played the stalker) and so was Juno Temple and of course! Amy Irving?! I mean what the hell, Amy Irving, I thought she retired like years ago so it was fun to see her again cause I never knew she was going to be in it and she was also great. Unsane is a clever, intense and very atmospheric movie with great acting that keeps it fresh!",/review/rw4109191/?ref_=tt_urv

","UNSANE (2018) **1/2 Claire Foy, Joshua Leonard, Jay Pharoah, Amy Irving, Juno Temple. Steven Soderbergh's unnerving, creepy-as-fuck psychological horror mind-f of a movie has brittle, but clever Foy (excellent in an almost unlikeable performance; no mean feat) as a young career woman whose recent past involving a stalker has her unknowingly committing herself to a clinic where she is more or less held prisoner with possibly her lurker in the midst. Shot on an iPhone (!) the nasty feeling of being too close washed over you like a film of filth and the wicked screenplay by Jonathan Bernstein and James Greer keeps one on edge even though it veers from terror to black comedy at a moment's notice (and it doesn't help that Leonard looks like every known pedophile circa the late 1970s).",/review/rw4109191/?ref_=tt_urv
