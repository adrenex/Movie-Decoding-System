4 March 2020,IndridC0ld,10," Ms. Foster's finest work, and the most thoughtful, scientifically accurate film since Kubrick's 2001
","In my 61 years, I have seen many science fiction films. Few have exceeded my expectations as this film did. I remember seeing it in a theater (something I rarely trouble myself with these days), and finding myself at times gripping the armrests in excitement. This film builds like great stories should. However, even the best stories can collapse under the weight of a bad script, poor acting, or shoddy editing. I'm happy to say that none of these issues plagued this film. Ms. Foster delivers an extremely powerful performance and is a wonderful role model for women in science. All of the other actors also deliver memorable performances, but make no mistake, it is Ms. Foster's polished performance you will be thinking about when this film ends.",/review/rw8547446/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2015,bkoganbing,9," An Awful Waste Of Space
","Although Jodie Foster has won two Oscars in her career I think her best work was done in Contact, a film where the only recognition it received was a nomination for Best Sound. She also never did a more serious film about a more serious topic. Are we in fact the only life there is in this vast universe and how do we find out.",/review/rw8547446/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2000,abettertomorrow,10," ""For Carl""
","Reading other peoples' reviews, I see a split 50/50 argument where one side loves the movie and the other hates it. I am not one bit surprised, due to the importance of the film, and I feel this is proof that Contact is one of the most powerful movies of the decade. Like the reaction from the civilians to the machine, a movie with this much heavy firepower is likely to get both loathing and praise from its viewers. I for one praise the film, for its toughness and sensitivity, symbolism and passion, and the fact that it is a rare science fiction film, a gem which was released in a time where scientific intelligence in film has become a nothing short of a joke as the wonder of the universe has been ignored and the mystery of alien life have become a neverending trail of movie villains.",/review/rw8547446/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2001,jhclues,10," Foster Makes ""Contact""
","All of the greatest work by the greatest scientists has been done while they were very young, when they were stupid enough to believe that two-plus-two-equals-five, and pursued it instead of listening to all of those who were much older and wiser who said Don't Waste Your Time. Einstein, it has been said, asked all of his important questions before the age of twenty-five, then spent the rest of his life working on them. `Contact,' directed by Robert Zemeckis, is the story of a young scientist, Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster), who like Einstein and all the greats before her, has been asking questions and seeking answers since she was very young. And now, as a member of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) team, she is able to pursue her obsession with the mysteries of the galaxies and the infinite universe that surrounds us.  Her job is to sweep the skies, using the most sophisticated equipment available, for a signal from deepest space.  It may be her job, but for Ellie it's a labor of love, for she is convinced that there is something, or someone, out there somewhere, because otherwise, she reasons, what a terrible waste of space it would be.  Ellie may be a dreamer, but she knows in her heart that it is the dreamers who over the years have been responsible for making us evolve, making us learn and grow because they are the ones who take insane, foolish ideas and pursue them.  And to her, two-plus-two will always be five.",/review/rw8547446/?ref_=tt_urv

","I had the luck of watching contact at the cinema when it came out . Being young meant that watching a movie of this grandure in a grand movie theatre with massive screen (something that was dying out at the time) means that this movie has been engraved in my mind .
But it is not due to nostalgia or corrupt memory .
Contact is a thought provoking mind bending movie ahead of its time .

","The 90's movies have a certain charm you can not replicate. It makes you belive in better things, makes you want to be better. I liket this movie because it focused on mankind, and not just America. Do not take me wrong. I dont have any problem with America, but there are a lot of things you have to consider besides that nation. I liked the how it made me think about the everlasting parallel between belief and technology. It gives you the right to choose, what you want to belive in. That is a very nice thing nowadays.",/review/rw8547446/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2002,jeeves-1,10," Different from the book doesn't mean bad.
","I am used to hearing from just about everyone who has read a book that was made into a movie that the book is always better.  I tend to agree with this opinion.  Contact, however, shows that in the arts the norm is not always the truth; opinion, no matter how often it is backed up with evidence, can never break through the barrier into be a hardened and absolute truth.",/review/rw8547446/?ref_=tt_urv

23 August 2008,alexx668,6," Contact
","""Contact"" is an interesting film, which primarily isn't about whether we're alone in space or not. Mostly it seems to examine and contrast three distinct types of personalities: the idealist scientist (Eleanor Arroway), the religious believer (Palmer Joss) and the logical strategist/ manipulator (David Drumlin or Michael Kitz). The film bridges the first two types (in the end Arroway's motivation is driven purely by faith, while Joss' faith reaches beyond religion), while the third type is the one that's really in control of mankind's destiny (the manipulative Drumlin gets the mission initially, while the cold logic of Kitz and co demands they cover up what really happened).",/review/rw8547446/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2021,andrewburgereviews,10," Religion. Science. Politics
","Robert Zemeckis' ""Contact"" can be a very flawed movie if you want it to be. Yet it avoids accruing any critics from my side because of how daring it is. It finds itself at the universal crossroads between science, religion and politics. Other movies have been there as well but no other has put the question so bluntly: ""Do you believe in God?""--if yes, why and if not why not?",/review/rw8547446/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have watched ""Contact"" at least 10x's throughout my life, it came out when I was 12yrs and we saw it in the theater. I was blown away by it then, and I still am blown away by it now, and I love the build up to the last 40 minutes, it is exhilarating. The only thing I felt was a weak point in the film, was Matthew Mcconaughey. I did not feel it necessary to the story, and in some ways, bogged it down, and I felt that way even the first time I saw it, this is not to say he is not enjoyable, he is, and I still enjoy the parts with him, but I did find his character to not be totally necessary to the story. Despite that one minor flaw, it still remains to this day one of my all time favorite films. ",/review/rw8547446/?ref_=tt_urv

12 July 2003,wisewebwoman,9," One of the best SF movies ever made
","And also a homage to the late great Carl Sagan.  I have seen this movie 3 times, the most recent being on DVD (more on that later).  I saw it originally on the big screen and it did not get the publicity it deserved. I then bought a copy of video to savour it again and was not disappointed. This is not a simplistic movie, the visuals are faultless and the clash of politics, religion and science very well done. As is the romance between the Reverend Palmer Joss (Played by Matthew McConaughy)and the atheistic Dr. Ellie Aroway (played by Jodie Foster). This issue of their sincerely held (but opposite) belief systems is never resolved but is left open. Ellie is a true scientist and even though some of the glory is withheld from her by a scheming ex-boss, somehow it all holds true, this sort of political jockeying happens and people do get away with it. The supporting cast is faultless and the special effects are incredible. Now the DVD - ""Special Edition"".  What a disappointment, mainly typewritten notes on a variety of topics, simplistic computer graphics of the sets and no interviews with the stars or even footage of Carl Sagan shown. No outtakes, deleted scenes or director commentary. A complete rip off. Keep your video. 9 out of 10 for the movie, a must-see.",/review/rw8547446/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 1998,Christof-2,10," the 2001 for the nineties
","Brilliant movie. Contact is based on the breathtaking novel written by the late Carl Sagan. It stars Jodie Foster as Ellie Arroway, a girl obsessed by what's out there. She intercepts an alien message, after which a mission is set up to go and meet the extra-terrestrials. But make no mistake, this is no Star Trek. This is a very pensive, intelligent movie that is times heartbreakingly sad. It is the 2001 for the nineties, since that movie was obviously somewhat of an inspiration. The ending may disappoint somewhat at first view, but actually turns out to be quite haunting if you give it a chance. Enjoy wonderful acting, great direction and amazing special effects. Read the book first though. You won't regret it.",/review/rw8547446/?ref_=tt_urv

","This 1997 film still packs a visceral and emotional wallop. Its treatment of serious scientific and emotional topics is exceptional. I remember seeing it soon after its opening at Century City in LA and came away totally amazed. It was also the LOUDEST film I had ever seen up to that time -- Arroway's walk through the Machine to the device must be listened to with a decent subwoofer. Plus, the destruction of the first machine is totally shocking. I recommend for anyone interested in the film to listen to Foster's commentary on the DVD/Blu-Ray. The ferocious intelligence she brought to the film is evident.",/review/rw8547446/?ref_=tt_urv
