12 April 2019,LukeCustomer2,6," Ok if you're not seeking innovation.
","I enjoyed this one but what holds it back is any sort of non paint by the numbers story. Noah Centineo plays ""Brooks Rattigan"" (come on guys come up with a real name) a good poor kid who has set his sites on Yale and the good life. While doing this he comes up with the idea for an app to be like a task rabbit for dating. (actually good idea). However, he soon finds that he is losing himself to pretending to be whomever for the app and some of his real life friends are getting tried of being stood up and ignored. My only thought on this was it didn't seem that Brooks was doing anything wrong per se. The script sort of had to twist itself around to have the ""dark moment"" and his friends came off a little selfish not to let him have this new thing in his life. Of course, he does learn that yearning after the good life and Yale has its drawbacks and isn't all it seems to be. There is a romance with Laura Marano ""Celia"" but it was definitely very BFF. I didn't get any sort of romantic vibe.",/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2019,nrppaul,9," It's the same. But the same is good for me
","It's literally the same as all other Noah Centineo movies. The same writing and plot line and storyline of all teen Netflix original movies recently. Same aesthetic, same soundtrack, same morals and same story. But, I loved it lol. If you're after something new and innovative, this isn't it. But if you're after a feel-good teen romance movie with that aesthetic and cute adorable Noah Centineo dorky smile? Then this is a nice hour and a half for you",/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2019,sketchpoetjon,8," Predictable and Cliche but overall cute
",Aside from its obvious predictability i found this film to be cute and heartwarming.The actor who plays the protagonist often plays these kinds of roles but does so quite well. The awkward quirky eventual love interest is adorable at best. Gay black friend is a nice change from the usual token black guy however i found his acting somewhat weak and his part was rather small. Perhaps if he were given a back story and some more depth to his character the movie could have shown a little more meaning. Don't get me wrong the message was a nice one but maybe a little too basic and let's face it he still has some growing up to do. He mentioned he was 18 but learning 1 lesson does not maketh man.,/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2019,heather_cloude,7," Probably a 6 but I watched it on a good day...
","This is nothing original but if you're looking for a feel good movie then this would do okay. It's actually pretty cute albeit very predictable. I really liked the character of Celia. To be honest, this would be a hit if it were an 80s movie.",/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2019,Sacotra,8," Fun, light and entertaining
","I'm very confused by all the bad reviews here, and so early after the movie's release. Almost like some kind of co-ordinated outpouring of disappointment. Hmm... What did I miss?",/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2019,giuliacypriano,5," Predictable and cringe worthy
","I almost fell asleep 3 times while watching this movie. Do yourself a favor and watch something worth your time. The characters have very little chemistry and poor personal development. Besides their storylines being shallow, it was even more unbearable having to watch another stereotypical ""I'm not like other girls/I'm sarcastic and wear combat boots"" trope on screen. Even though I like Noah Centineo, it gets tiring seeing him play the same roles over and over again. He can do better.",/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2019,colleencanada,7," Ok ""Critics"" Calm Down....
","Is this movie predictable? Yes. A little cheesy. For sure. A mashup of teen movies before it. Oh Hell Yeah. But even for a cynic like me, I have to say it was a sweet little movie. And hey, it has the right message-look after your friends and family, be true to yourself and here's a novel idea-embrace something positive.
It was refreshing to see something innocent..",/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2019,bribrown7,4," It's pretty bad.
","Netflix, you can't just throw Noah Centineo into a subpar movie and expect no one to notice. This movie was seriously rushed. Some of the characters' actions just didn't make sense. Who kisses someone literally 3 seconds after a public breakup, and asks them to a dance even though they've met like 3 times? No one! And would it kill Noah to put forth some effort? You can't play the same role in every film. Also, there was no character development for anyone except Brooks, a sorry excuse for a plot, and no chemistry between the male and female leads. Throw the whole movie away. It only got 4 stars because I managed to sit through the whole thing.",/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2019,julian_t_ward,7," Standard Rom Com formula but very charmingly done
","Yes, this is a rom com by the numbers, fully up to date with fun and games around dating apps. But the two leads have genuine charm and spar off each other with believable chemistry. Whilst probably not a film that you will remember in years to come, you will nevertheless have a very enjoyable 90 minutes watching this.",/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2019,BlueSkies765,7," Enjoyable
",The Perfect Date is a coming of age teen rom-com. For this demographic it's a relatable movie with a positive message.,/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2019,travisesmon,7," Exactly what it's supposed to be
","It was a fine movie. Predictable like every other teen movie, but fun to watch. So ignore all the nonsense reviews claiming they need their time back. My guess is their time isn't worth more than anyone else's who's chosen a Netflix teen movie for some easy watching. Plenty of funny moments and plenty enjoyable.",/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2019,foxtrotmarie,7," It is what it is and its cute
",If you go into the Netflix teen movies not expecting ground breaking then you'll be fine. They follow a predictable script and don't have many twists and turns but they are cute and interesting enough.,/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2019,mandokal,8," Great feel-good movie!
","What movie were all these naysayers watching?
Great chemistry between the main characters, predictable BUT likeable storyline.",/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2019,ginocox-206-336968,3," Tries too hard to be inoffensive
",The Perfect Date (2019) looks and feels like a television program.,/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2019,ops-52535,5," a flat story
","Without the crazy ups and downs you may expect from a comedy. its just that there are nothing here that makes me laugh, just a smile inside, and the rest is just cattanooga cho cho, with a lot of conversations with different persons in different settings",/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2019,jasminhegmann,8," Pretty good
","Okay so I don't know why Noah Centineo is in like every Netflix Original romcom..?
But from all of those that I watched, this is by far the one I liked best.
Original idea, funny.. and sure the end was not a surprise. But I guess that is why we all enjoy those movies so much, because there are days we just need a good old happy end, am I right?",/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2019,kosmasp,7," Dating can be tough
","Well this is of course not the first movie to have males offering themselves to be dated. But this takes it to the teen genre and it does quite a fine job with it. I mean it is predictable to a ""t"", but it is also lovely. We know who is meant for each the moment we see them. But it is refreshing to see that the ""others"" are not too much of a caricature of a human being.",/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2019,nehatandon0019,7," Yes...It was Predictable. No...It was not bad.
","I went with no expectations at all but it was likeable, mainly because the lead was extremely cute. Now, this movie is for a special target audience..teens who are into romcoms...so, if it fits the bill..its worth a watch!",/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2019,kateb-19665,3," It is my own fault
","I can't believe I let myself watch another Netflix teen movie and so I should not be surprised that once again the credits have started to roll and I have wondered what I could have done with my life during the last 90mins that I have wasted. We do like that Noah Centineo plays another ""Noah Centineo"" character with his charming, adorkable smile but his almost non-existent romantic chemistry with Laura Marano had me hoping they'd just stay friends by the end of the film. Also, please stop with the pop-song-montage of scenes that took place during the movie, at the end of the film - I just watched the whole movie, I don't need to watch it again.",/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2019,panda-65927,1," A huge waste of time
","This movie is a 90 minute span of nothingness where the ending felt like the sweet release of death. The plot is basically non-existent and has no clear direction and feels more like random scenes glued together badly by a toddler. The trailer gives away the whole movie while simultaneously being WAY better than the movie. If you wanted a movie about the app he made and the dates he goes on as the trailer selled it as, well too bad because you only get a 2 minute montage of that! Instead, watch two actors with absolutely no chemistry ""fall in Love"" as Laura insults Noah and they learn nothing about each other. This movie is soo boring and the trailer is so misleading but the worst thing about it is that lack of chemistry between the two leads. I would never watch this again.",/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2019,bloodworia,7," Solid mediocre flick
","The idea behind this is very nice. At times it become really cringy and the characters action actually make no sense at all other than serve the plot later on. Watched it with my gf, cant complain it was enough entertainment to not be bored, i have seen far worse. I'll give it a very casual 7.",/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2019,kerenulas,4," That was soooo bad!!
","I watched the movie only because of Noah Centineo but now I feel his whole acting career is to basically play the same guy!!!
He just copied every element of Peter Kavinsky and did it much worse.
I'm done with these Netflix movies.",/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2019,fluffset,6," so promising but...
","It start really good in the first 30 minutes, we like all the characters. But after that, it just become too predictable, all drama seems so forced. I still like it because they are cute & everything but the ending was meh....",/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2019,misswritercreates,8," Cute & funny!
","We watched the trailer and it looked like it would be pretty good and it was!! It was cute, funny and yes your typical teenage movie. Except not much on the mean kids and not the hard partying you usually see. It was light, fluffy with life lessons. Pretty great movie, our entire family enjoyed it!",/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2019,noahsmithmichael,10," DONT LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS!!!!
",Develop your own opinion on the film. I for one loved the chemistry between the two leads and the goofy antics that come along with it. Although this is a bit predictable that doesn't make it any less enjoyable or fun or spontaneous. Please don't avoid it b/c bad reviews tell you to...,/review/rw4778499/?ref_=tt_urv
