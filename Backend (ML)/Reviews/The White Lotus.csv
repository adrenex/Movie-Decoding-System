11 March 2005,Danny_G13,10," Caustic, sharp, bitter, sweet, and nigh-on perfect
","Razor sharp comedy starring Ted Danson might not appeal to everyone, given its focus on a cantankerous and highly grumpy doctor, but the script is incredibly strong.",/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2004,Bobs-9,," Goodbye, Becker
","I watched the final ""Becker"" episode last night, and will miss this series. Critics have beaten up on this show quite a lot lately, but I watched it regularly and always enjoyed it.  The characters are diverse and likeable, and I particularly admire Shawnee Smith, who played Linda, for taking a character that could have been annoying in the extreme and making her sweet and funny.  One of the funniest things I've seen in a sitcom is when Linda, in trying to fix the hanging skeleton in Becker's office, managed to crazy-glue her hand to that of the skeleton.  She ended up walking around the office all day holding hands with the skeleton, which rolled alongside her on its stand (you had to see it to appreciate it).",/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2000,Op_Prime,," Ted Danson's best work since Cheers
","This show is funny and very original. The show is like a reflection of everyday life, sort of like Seinfeld. But whereas Seinfeld gives a more positive out look to the world, Becker does the opposite. Every episode has Ted Danson complaining about something; a broken street light in front of his apartment, his annoying patients, the post office and much, much more. A very funny show.",/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2001,mattkratz,8," very funny
","I just started watching this show a few months ago, and already I love it. Ted Danson is wonderful as the title character, and I think it is refreshingly funny and good. Shawnee Smith also makes a terrific airhead in Linda.",/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2004,couchpotato100,," A unique and funny show (A)
","Well I just found out that the show has ended, which prompts me to write this review for the show. Something that I rarely do, and I am doing so now because I thought the show possessed something special.",/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2008,elshikh4,9," Becker: Where The Laughing Voices at Every Situation or Line are So Right !!
","Now this is a rare time to describe a sitcom as great. Every other show got something to do with what I call it the American comedy. But (Becker) is for all I think. That's related to what kind of characters, situations, and issues that it presents. So its cleverness comes from being humanly profound whereupon internationally effective.",/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2018,reachkiramurphy,10," Great Comedy Series
","This show is very underrated. I didn't even watch it until recently but it's a great comedy that actually has a bit of an edge to it. Ted Danson of Cheers fame plays Dr. Becker, who has kind of a negative attitude. He and his staff and patients, and family/friends, are all good characters with good actors playing them, with some well written stories and jokes to go with it. Worth checking out for sure, too bad it doesn't have more fans out there, but it did somehow last several years.",/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2006,paudio,," Used to be funny, when they still had Reggie
","I liked Becker very much, that is, until they eliminated Reggie's character and replaced her with Chris. They also kinda changed Becker's character a bit. The result: the show lost its ratings and got canceled.",/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2004,cfabar1,," Amazingly Fresh
","Becker is perhaps one of the most original Situation Comedies to arrive on television since Cheers. The original, witty, and intelligent style that it uses is very wonderful, but even more important could possibly be the character relationships. I've often considered this series to be ""friends with personalities"" It is sorely missed and I hope in time more people will grow to be a viewer through reruns. However the series is not great. Ideally the series was on top when Bob was a non-regular, Reggie was in the cast, and Dr. Carson was a recurring character. When Bob was a guest star the series would not overdo his character and once he appeared in every episode there was a lack of the power that he had in the previous episodes. This show really unwound by the final two seasons which were partially recast and just not on par with the previous years. Watch the first four seasons and you will love this television gem!",/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2003,grumpyass,10," Awesome sitcom
","I have only recently started to watch it, since i moved to Cali.  I only have antenna TV.  I watch it all the time and I laugh my a$$ off every time. I hope it last for a long while.  I am going to a live taping of the show so I am quite excited about that one.  This show is great, Becker is the kinda of guy you'd never really want to bump into but it hilarious to watch. Two Thumbs up!!!!",/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2003,opsbooks,8," What's this, an intelligent sitcom?
","Becker is everyman; he says right out what the rest of us probably think most of the time. Reggie is his female equivalent, which is why they would never get together, relationship-wise. They're just too much alike, though Reggie hides it pretty well. Here in Australia we've only just come to the Chris eps without Reggie, so I've avoided reading many of the other comments. The show works from all angles thanks to an always masterful script, much like 'Everyone Loves Raymond', the only other current US comedy I like. Margaret is a sweetie; Linda drives me crazy most of the time. Jake is one of a kind and Bob; well, we've all known a Bob in our time. Put them all together and you have one cool AND intelligent sitcom!",/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2005,FloatingOpera7,," Ted Danson Delivers Great Comedy
","From 1998 to 2004, Ted Danson played the misanthropic, in-your-face lovable cynic Dr. John Becker. Working in his clinic in New York City are the ditsy, youthful Linda and the sassy, smart and strong Margaret. The show was never as popular as The King of Queens, which it was always competing against. But Becker was a well-written show, where the strength was mostly in the characters. Becker was angry, cynical and hated sunshine, puppies, Valentines and many things, but he had a dignity of his own, and often we were angry WITH him because so many of the issues that made him made were understandably upsetting. Divorced twice, unlucky in love, and surrounded by a rather annoying group of friends- mainly at Regg's dinner, Jake and Bob, he was someone we just loved to see explode. The comedy is smart and well-written and very definitive of the 90's.",/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2005,a1e8ayer,," Great Comedy
","We love Becker here in the UK it is a really funny comedy and look forward to each hilarious episode Ted Danson Plays an excellent role as Becker He is ably supported by Nancy Travis ,Shawnee Smith,Alex Desert, and the rest of the crew There is a great rapport between the characters which blend well together We think it is one of the most original and funniest situation comedies of all time There is nothing to compare with the quality of the scripts at present here in the UK at present and the fine acting compliments the scripts well. I heard that it has ended production in 2004 I hope that it does carry on as the standard has not fallen throughout it's production run",/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2020,dbrockskk1,10," bob and reggie
",I really miss bob and reggie. hector and chris just don't do it for me especially chris. she seems to have no personality. wish bob and reggie would have come back!!,/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2019,Johnny_West,10," Becker better without Linda
","Ted Danson did a great job reacting to the characters and situations around him, and while he was grumpy, it was always light and humorous. This was a good show for the first four seasons. After Reggie (Terry Farell) left, it tried to become a romantic comedy with Nancy Travis as his love interest.",/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2004,smithster,," AKA ""Harvey Pekar, M.D.""
",This show is hilarious.,/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2011,Blueghost,," Good show.
","I watched the first few seasons of Becker. I saw the premier, and then took in the rest of the first few seasons. I lost interest thereafter for some reason.",/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2002,crash21,10," The best sitcom in history
","Becker is, in my opinion, the best sitcom of all time. You would have thought his character in this show was based on my own personality. Actually, when I introduce myself to someone, I ask them ""have you ever see the show Becker?"" Becker was also, as far as I know, the only sitcom in history to ever do holiday episodes right. Typically, nothing is lamer than a Christmas sitcom episode, but the writers for Becker did this all right. Christmas episodes are typically all about lame Christmas miracles and Santa Clause, Becker's version of Christmas episodes were actually made to be as funny as the regular episodes.",/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2010,blanche-2,8," Great performance by Ted Danson
","Ted Danson is ""Becker,"" an angry, bitter, cantankerous doctor with a heart of absolute gold. The series ran for six years and was populated with some great characters: Jake, the blind man; Reggie, who ran the coffee shop where Becker hung out; Margaret, the no-nonsense warm and funny woman who runs Becker's office; Linda, the ditsy assistant; Bob, who talks in the third person; and many others, who passed through the coffee shop and Becker's office during the show's run.",/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2003,Derrado18,," Pretty good (possible spoiler warning!)
","Overall a pretty good show, although I think it went just a bit downhill with the introduction of Chris. Reggie was far more funny. Becker however is still his moody and irritable best, Margaret and Linda are both hilarious, but Jake (and less so, Bob) seem to be less funny around Chris. Still a very good show though!",/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2006,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,9," A must-see CBS hit!
","""BECKER,"" in my opinion, is a must-see CBS hit! Despite the fact that I've never seen every episode, I still enjoyed it. My favorite one is the one where Becker (Ted Danson) went to therapy for anger management after being sued for malpractice. Also, I really loved the theme song. If you ask me, even though I liked everyone, it would have been nice if everyone had stayed on the show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, even though it can also be seen in syndication now, I strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good.",/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2006,christopherandbarb,," I love this show, but.........
","I love this show. Strong characters who interact like real people in realistic situations. Ted Danson shows the opposite side of his role in Cheers, and is still funny as he**! ",/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2017,michaelthompsonmcgill,," Becker is the smartest cookie on the block.
",Ted Danson nails Becker. And Becker is every man..,/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2005,littlekittentails,," A GREAT show that never should have been canceled
","Becker is a wonderful comedy that made its debut in 1998 six years back but very unfortunately, maybe even tragically was canceled in 2004. Thankfully reruns play so at least that's in order.",/review/rw1148890/?ref_=tt_urv
