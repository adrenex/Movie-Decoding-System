",It's always controversial to review a title like this. On one side we have the people who blindly defend something and on the other side we have the people who's blindly against something ....and everybody's blaming the other for giving unfair scores for different reasons.,/review/rw5734161/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2020,Sleepin_Dragon,3," It made me sleepy.
","I'm glad I had my phone, the first half of the film was so boring, the second part was less boring, but still not great. Margot Robbie is good in the role, and she has some great fight scenes, the trouble is that the remainder of the film is so tedious. Good visuals, the trouble is the core of the film simply isn't there to make anything meaningful.",/review/rw5734161/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2020,danielmanson,8," I liked it
","I liked it. It was entertaining and that's what I wanted for a film.
I do get why people are whining about the ""men are bad"" agenda, but meh. Just didn't bother me in all honesty.
Plot: little loose here and there. But it was interesting and kept me entertained.
Didn't particularly like the detective character, but the others were great.
Overall I liked it.",/review/rw5734161/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2020,davidmvining,2," Intentionally poorly told is still poorly told
","This movie has a single objective: to hate men. There's literally no other reason this movie exists. No male character is remotely good in the end, they're all backstabbing rapists and psychopaths while even the criminal women are all sympathetic to the extreme. So, fine. That's its ultimate theme, but what about how the movie tells its story? Well, let's judge it purely on that, never mind its rampant misandry. It's, um, it's terrible.",/review/rw5734161/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2020,kaneeddy,5," Entertaining at times, but is all over the place
","Birds of Prey: and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn, is a movie I had high hopes for but it fell flat. I will start off this review with the positive aspects first such as: Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a great casting and continues to be where I think she gives a better performance then her one in Suicide Squad, and Ewan Mcgregor plays a decent version of Black Mask. The use of colours and costumes I thought were great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences.",/review/rw5734161/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2020,Ndetzzz,4," Boring and forgettable
","While Margot Robbie is a good Harley Quinn, the character was not given enough arc. The plot was predictable and mainstream, especially due to lack of a strong antagonist. The main antagonist, played by Ewan McGregor, was not developed and hence did not add significant value to the plot story. Although some of the fight scenes were entertaining, the film as a whole was truly forgettable.",/review/rw5734161/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2020,gcarpiceci,5," A messy movie with some moments of fun
","If you are not driven by the imperative need of understanding precisely what is happening in your movie, you might enjoy this psychedelic mix of disjointed cool visuals, great music, firecrackers, fragments of good acting...
Birds Of Prey is a mess presented in a messy way, it hardly holds together as a story but it offers moments of fun.",/review/rw5734161/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2021,kevin_robbins,3," I wish DC didnt ruin this title and these characters
","Birds of Prey (2020) is a movie we saw in theatres shortly after it came out. The storyline focuses on Harley Quinn post Suicide Squad after she breaks up with the Joker, recovers from her depression from the breakup, and starts a new life of crime with a new crew of thieves known as Birds of Prey. A lunatic is not a fan of her work and sets out to hunt her and her crew down and bring them to their demise. This movie is directed by Cathy Yan (Dead Pigs) and stars Margot Robbie (Suicide Squad), Rosie Perez (White Men Can't Jump), Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting) and Jurnee Smollett (Lovecraft Country). The storyline for this is a huge step down from Suicide Squad and maybe the worst DC movie to date. The film tried to be cool and creative but everything from the title, storyline and premise was delivered poorly, which is too bad because the cast had potential, the writing and execution failed the potential though. Birds of Prey is a great DC storyline...but that team was created and led by Barbara Gordon, so why use that premise, remove Barbara and insert Harley Quinn, and think you'll be fine? Easy, to capitalize on the money from Suicide Squad. Unfortunately, it didnt work. I wouldn't recommend watching this and I wish DC didnt ruin this title and these characters (who are actually very good). I'd score this a 3/10 and recommend skipping it.",/review/rw5734161/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2020,aidanratesmovies,10," A fun, although slightly unoriginal, blast
","With some great, all out performances, and a sheer sense of fun energy; Birds of Prey makes for an entertaining comic book film that may not be totally original, but is certainly different from the rest. The film's script can be a bit average at times, containing plot points you have certainly seen before, however, where Birds of Prey shines most is its unique sense of storytelling and the ridiculously entertaining things it does with it. Margot Robbie give a 'fabulous' performance as Harley Quinn, removing all my doubts of her playing the famous character after Suicide Squad. The other women in the film also give some great performances, with the greatest stand out being Mary Elizabeth Winstead who steals every ounce of her screen time, bringing her A-game as always. Ewan McGregor also gives a fun filled performance as the film's titular villain Black Mask. The film is filled with absolutely awesome action sequences that are bound to at least put a grin on your face, and if that doesn't, then the large dose of well-timed humor will certainly do the trick. In the end, Birds of Prey isn't the best DC has had to offer, but it is certainly a blast, and certainly an experience unlike any other.
My Rating: 9.25/10",/review/rw5734161/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2020,CANpatbuck3664,9," Completely Bizarre Yet Stylish and Well Acted , DC Goes All Out With Birds of Prey
","Some movies decide to bring you along slowly, they setup the plot and bring you in by introducing you to the key players. Other movies kick the door open and grab you to take you along for the ride. Birds of Prey is decidedly one of the latter cases. We begin with an animated intro being narrated by Harley (Margot Robbie) where the audience is showered with cursing, violence and frenetic jokes. This was disarming for me and it helped me start laughing right off the bat. Its an odd choice to be sure but this isn't a movie that's ashamed or trying to hide what it is and I respected that choice. It also introduces the visual sensibility of the movie. It borrows from Suicide Squad but they do a good job cherry picking what worked from that movie and they leave behind the less desirable parts. The character cards are back with a couple of twists and the world is decidedly grimy and less glamorous which was a nice change of setting.",/review/rw5734161/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2020,iamkeysersoze-13228,7," Robbie and McGregor are brilliant even if the film suffers a tad at times

26 October 2021,Leofwine_draca,5," Merely so so
","The latest DC Comics superhero movie and once again it's rather generic and forgettable in tone. The action in this one is okay but the comedy is very poor and Harley Quinn herself is best in small doses, so making her the lead character is a bizarre choice. The deliberately adult tone just means constant swearing shoehorned into the script while Ewan McGregor's bad guy is as bland as they come. It's better than GUNPOWDER MILKSHAKE thanks to a couple of halfway decent action scenes and creatively quirky moments, but the rest is merely so-so.",/review/rw5734161/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2020,bankofmarquis,7," Better than SUICIDE SQUAD
","Did you catch the 2016 DCEU disappointment SUICIDE SQUAD with Will Smith as Deadshot and Jared Leto as the Joker? Many people (myself included) thought that that film was ""just fine, nothing special"" but were impressed with the way Margot Robbie handled the Harley Quinn character and wished for a standalone film that featured the Harley Quinn character.",/review/rw5734161/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2020,JuniorTorres720,8," Margot Robbie Does Great as Harley Quinn
","Finally got a chance to watch Birds of Prey yesterday. I thought this movie would perform better at the box office, but sadly it isn't. Margot Robbie is an outstanding actress and I hoped the movie would have greater success for her. I'm not a huge DC fan, but still had to watch this. I enjoyed it and felt like Margot was very entertaining in her role as Harley Quinn. She was tough, funny, and was multi-dimensional. This wasn't a great film in my opinion, but an enjoyable good film that I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel to.",/review/rw5734161/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2020,blanbrn,9," Birds of a different feather! High Flying kick butt action bad girl style!
","As a ""D.C."" comics fan I see most all of the movies and this latest was a kick butt action style drama with twist and turns as it is a spotlight of bad girls at their best ""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn delivers with action and story. Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie) has just split from her boyfriend ""The Joker"" so she has to spread her wings free and become a free girl! All of this is helped along by a cast of side characters like detective Renee Montoya, Huntress, and the sexy and beautiful black bra wearing Black Canary! However all are tied and wrapped up in a wild card subplot that involves defeating a crazy and sadistic crime lord in Roman Sionis(AKA ""Black Mask"") and underneath all of this lies the search for a diamond and teenager named Cass(Ella Jay Basco). Aside from all of this the film entertains with violence, action, bombs, and flashbacks that tell character story. Look at this as a bad ass female group as each fight crime and for their own way of life in a gleeful way The costumes are also an eye catch and the dialogue moves the film along well, so if a comic book fan open up to this picture as it's full of antiheroine glory.",/review/rw5734161/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2020,iamianiman,6," A great all-girls group film, Birds of Prey eases itself up in the sky though meeting some obstacles to finding its worthy predators.
","Admittedly speaking, remember there was a time when DC Universe was bashed because most of their movies were directed by Zack Snyder who decided that style-over-substance was more pivotal to making superhero films? Then, came David Ayer with a set of the best movie trailers ever created but the outcome for the anti-hero film, Suicide Squad was at best, a mediocre motion picture.",/review/rw5734161/?ref_=tt_urv

",Margot Robbie is the perfect Harley Quinn. Over all BOP was super fun. Great action and great music. Rosie Perez is meh at best. Ewan kills it per usual. I love that they made an R rated comic book film. DC has the balls to do it knowing it won't make as much $$$ which is probably why this is one of the better comic movies to come out in a while. 7/10🖤,/review/rw5734161/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2020,MR-ODIN,," Birds of Prey
","Continues a wining-ish streak for DC with a pretty solid film that is at the very least WAY better than Suicide Squad. It's messy as hell, at times crassly mean-spirited, and mostly not that funny, but for the most part it's still a great deal of fun. Harley is still a fun character, and this version of her that is more than just an oversexualized girlfriend of the Joker is a much more interesting character to follow. Her girl gang and resentful breakup is also just a very human story. Yeah it was done better in the animated series currently on DC Universe, but still, this one is fun. The other Birds are pretty good, especially Huntress, but this really is Harley's show, and she's good. I do have to give love to Ewan McGregor as Black Mask. Yeah he's done villains before, but good god, this is one helluva villain. I love the character Black Mask, and he absolutely nails the character. Charming, funny, completely psychotic, I was a happy geek watching him on screen. Not to mention McGregor is clearly having a ball in the roll, and that energy does pass on to you. Overall though Birds of Prey is a mess. It's plot is basically Snatch but not as good, and it's attitude is aggressive, but god damn does it ever have an attitude. It has an identity, a style, and a look I can't deny, and I will admit it was pretty fun. It's got some solid performances, characters I wanted to see, and a solid style. It's a wild swing, and while it doesn't totally nail it, I admire it's ambition.",/review/rw5734161/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2020,curbicon,8," Review, from someone who ACTUALLY saw the movie!
","I'll just go straight for it, if you're going to downvote this review for defending a genuinely entertaining violent film, i get that. Literally just WATCH THE MOVIE! This movie is anything but a ""men are trash"" movie. It's a fun flick about a heist where it's all knives at eachothers throats. Genuinely formulaic at times, sure, but that's practically a given for these types of films! Margot Robbie gave a fantastic performance as the Quinn herself, and the side characters had their moments as well! Gotta give a FAT shoutout to McGregor for his role. He brought just as much flame and fire as Margot gave her role. Go ahead and do yourself a favor. This is a good ass time to watch!",/review/rw5734161/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2020,westsideschl,2," For Comic Book Lovers
","I was captured to watch this in part from the DVD cover, and in part from the potential in the story. It started out as an introductory flat 2-D cheap Saturday morning cartoon intro to our main character. That was pretty snoozy but I kept waiting and waiting and ... until I noticed my brain alertness level was somewhere between watching grass grow & deep sleep.
Summation:
1. Movie is suppose to be a superhero team spoof, but so shallow flat I actually ended up not caring - just waiting for it to end.
2. 50% of screen time is like a fashion show catwalk of Robbie & her sometimes being cute by staring at the camera; just dumb & boring. Another 25% was showcasing how non-conforming her character could be which did not come across as real - actually it was comic book real.
3. Action scenes were 90% very poorly executed flying kicks & arm takedowns that a 10 year old could perform better.
4. Both dialogue & music lyrics were heavy on the obscenities; a cheap way to fake toughness.
5. Only positive, about 30 seconds worth, was Jurnee Smollett-Bell's singing a classic song.",/review/rw5734161/?ref_=tt_urv
