9 September 2019,Surecure,9," Powerful and thought provoking
","I was incredibly fortunate to have seen Sound of Metal at the Toronto International Film Festival including a Q&A after with the director and cast. Whereas a lot of films may take the storyline into melodramatic territory, Sound of Metal explores not only the reality of those who are deaf which is so poorly represented in film and television but also the destructive nature and high cost of denial and self-deception in the face of hard truths.",/review/rw5122323/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2020,Xstal,9," Profoundly Reflective, Original & Universally Relevant...
","Taking the auditory experience of film to a brand new and original level, Riz Ahmed signs an immensely authentic performance as a drummer locked from sound without warning. The film builds around the way he learns to come to terms with the challenges his disability presents, through the discovery of who he really is as life, meaning and purpose graft perspective to his being. With a great supporting cast, this is a landmark piece of cinema to be savoured.",/review/rw5122323/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2020,ferguson-6,8," Riz nails the solo
","Greetings again from the darkness. Many of us have attended concerts and experienced a ringing in our ears for a while afterwards. Have you ever thought about the musicians who are playing that music night after night? It's a risk requiring precautions ... and even then, disaster can occur. The first narrative feature from writer-director Darius Marder uses the hearing loss of a heavy metal drummer to explore what happens when the life we know is suddenly snatched away.",/review/rw5122323/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2021,kosmasp,10," The sound and the not sound
","While it does start with music and a band and performances (live), this movie is not so much about music .. it is about one of our senses! Many of us don't even realize how precious they are (our senses), because we have them and see them as a given. It is therefor quite incredible what the movie achieves by taking us on a journey.",/review/rw5122323/?ref_=tt_urv

5 April 2021,cliftonofun,9," Saving (and accepting) ourselves
","Confession: I'm a total sucker for recovery stories - maybe it is the former social worker in me. Now, some people might suggest this movie's about music or the deaf community, but I honesty believe it is about saving (and accepting) ourselves. It is about the addictions that define us, whether we're embracing or surrendering them...and the people that help heal us along the way. In other words, it IS a recovery story. And it is also flawlessly done. The performances are intimate, the sounds/silences keep drawing you in, and the moments of stillness are absolutely breathtaking. Marder's crafted something that feels so personal and authentic, an invitation into these characters' lives and experiences. When the credits rolled, I just sat there taking it in.",/review/rw5122323/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2021,Dog-River,6," Good, But Not Perfect
","While I think Riz Ahmed gave award-worthy performance in this film, the implant misinformation lowered my rating. Getting implants is not a quick process and a good audiologist would never tell a patient you're just going to have to get used to it. It takes multiple visits before and after surgery. That being said, I really enjoyed the scenes with the deaf community and him working with the children. I would give the acting 10/10. It has a great cast.",/review/rw5122323/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2020,wesley-j-lucas,10," Fantastic film; the double entendre title won't hit you til the end!
","First off, Rizwan Ahmed is one of the best actors working right now and his performance in this film is gut wrenching, believable, and absolutely stunning to watch as you can do nothing but become engrossed in his acting and ability to make you feel exactly what his character is feeling. It's hard to believe that there was ever anyone else in mind for his role!",/review/rw5122323/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2020,cansarica-34870,10," Masterpiece!
","Masterpiece! I was expecting a movie like Whiplash but this one is far better. Whiplash is a story of ""If you work hard, you succeed."" This one is ""If you work hard, you succeed, then one day you can lose everything in a second, and if you work harder, you can realize that ""everything"" is actually nothing.""

31 January 2020,emo_ville2002,9," Riz Ahmed, excellent as always!
","Riz Ahmed is one of those actors, you simply cannot take your eyes off. It's not solely because of his good looks. He's always intense and, most importantly, he always makes you care about the characters he's portraying. In this case, he portrays a rock drummer who is losing his hearing.",/review/rw5122323/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2021,RMurray847,5," Riz Ahmed is outstanding, but the rest of movie falters significantly
","Riz Ahmen is Ruben, a drummer in a hard rock ""band"" (which is just him and his girlfriend, Oliva Cooke). They share a strangely quiet, gentle existence living out of an old Air Stream and travelling the country. Their music is loud and angry; their lives are restrained. We learn that Ruben is a recovering addict and we soon learn that he is suddenly and quickly losing his hearing. It's a devastating diagnosis. To lose his hearing is to make who he thinks he is (a drummer & overall musician) nearly impossible. He is encouraged to go to a home for newly deaf adults who are also addicts. (One of the faults of the movie is that we aren't told exactly why or how this decision is reached. One day, he's just going there.) Ruben works to fit in and gradually finds a place for himself. But in the back of his mind, all this is a ""holding pattern"" while he tries to come up with the funds to get a cochlear implant to regain his hearing.",/review/rw5122323/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2021,Jeremy_Urquhart,6," Wanted to like this a lot more than I did

12 December 2020,Quinoa1984,10," A powerful story of transformation from tragic circumstance
","About how to live with the stillness of oneself, which whether you are deaf or not - and the filmmakers must know that the greater part of the audience watching and hearing this can take the movie in with all their senses - is always a massively difficult weight to bear psychically; the absolute, all-encompassing joy and power (but also the work) of being in a community that understands and accepts and in its way loves you, and visa versa, and that maybe that one two-person noise-metal group needs a hiatus now and again.",/review/rw5122323/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2021,cardsrock,9," A tremendous achievement in sound
","Sound is something you don't often see manipulated like this in film. The use of sound here is incredibly innovative and pushes this film to another level.

All of the frustration, fear, and peace that accompany such an life-altering change is seen through the eyes of Ruben.",/review/rw5122323/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2021,classicsoncall,8," ""Serenity is no longer wishing you had a different past.""
","The story here takes you into the world of the deaf and the hearing impaired and demonstrates what it's like to be without one's hearing. I have a bit of trouble in that department myself but nowhere as difficult; I'm forced to use captioning on the movies I watch because the dialog in most films sounds garbled to me. Still, I can't comprehend being totally deaf in the way it affected someone who relies on hearing for their occupation. I thought Riz Ahmed was very effective as drummer Ruben Stone, experiencing almost near total hearing loss while performing with his girlfriend while on tour with a band. Though I think anyone in the same circumstance would harbor anger and denial, it did seem that Ruben accepted his fate more quickly and agreeably than most once he came within Joe's (Paul Raci) orbit at the community for the deaf. It was heartwarming also to see how he ingratiated himself with the young school kids who helped him adjust with his signing. Where the picture skewed considerably from the story line was in the freedom Ruben had to check his emails and have access to his van after Joe set down rules for no contact with the outside world. That all seemed a bit too loose, for example, with Ruben having the keys for his vehicle after first surrendering them to Joe. The story also punted on how easily he was able to locate Lou (Olivia Cooke) in France, not to mention how he got there with no money after accounting for his surgery. Once there, I was also waiting for the shoe to drop on whether Lou found herself another boyfriend. It seemed that wasn't the case, although her reluctance with Ruben in an intimate moment suggested that may have been true. Full circle for Ruben occurs when he removes his hearing aids to contemplate the silence upon hearing the distorted pealing of the church tower bells. The look on his face suggested Joe's earlier comment about moments of stillness equating to the kingdom of God. I liked that analogy when Joe made the remark, though in that moment of silence, one is left to consider what Ruben's next move would be.",/review/rw5122323/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2020,dukecitydoors,5," Could have been better.
","My wife is and has been a ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter for over 15 years. I wrote this by her knowledge of the Deaf Community. The file does show the real struggles of someone who looses their hearing. BUT the film does it wrong in several areas. Deaf schools encourage those family members that can hear to also partake in learning sign language (Side by side). When someone gets the operation, it costs $5000-$7500 for each side. Usually it's one side at a time then six months of adjusting. About a year passed and continuous adjustments have to be done before the other side is operated on. By standard, it is encouraged for one side to only be done. The chaos of having two implants done at once has lead many to commit suicide. The movie does show the noise and craziness, but fails about the warnings. I gave this movie a five out of ten stars for not enough study and understanding for the Deaf. This film could have been amazing.",/review/rw5122323/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2019,arshadfilms1,9," Breathtaking performance from an underrated Riz Ahmed
",The Sound of Metal is definitely one of the top films this year and it has everything to do with the steak kar performances of the lead actor Riz Ahmed. With blond hair it's hard to even place him as a Pakistani playing the role. Ahmed is an intense actor and takes us into the world of a tormented drummer trying to come to terms with losing his hearing not long after overcoming addiction. This new battle takes him into an unfamiliar world where the sound design helps the audience feel what the protagonist must feel. This film selves into experimentation with the auditory experience of cinema. An absolute must-watch.,/review/rw5122323/?ref_=tt_urv
