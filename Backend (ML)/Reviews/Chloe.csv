8 December 2007,FiendishDramaturgy,9," Typically, I'm in the Minority Again. I LOVE This Movie!
","Okay, so it's a male version of the Craft...kinda. Yes, I'd have to agree with that summation; however, this features MUCH more story, more meat, more history, and a FAR better execution than the Craft. It also presents a much better developed story, characters, and production style.",/review/rw1572828/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2007,claudio_carvalho,6," Very Entertaining, But Could Be Much Better
","In 1692, in the Ipswich Colony of Massachusetts, five families of powerful witches commit to a covenant of silence to protect themselves against the witch hunters, but one of the families transgress their pact and is banished from their lands. Along the centuries, the power and the covenant are transmitted through their descendants and when the eldest son is eighteen years old, he ascends to a higher power. However, the use of magic addicts and if used in excess, ages the warlock. In the present days, four wizards teenage friends are in high school and their leader Caleb Danvers (Steven Strait) is close to his eighteenth birthday and consequently to ascend. He has just met Sarah Wenham (Laura Ramsey) and they are dating, when the appearance of darkling and supernatural dreams haunt the group. Sooner they find an evil warlock, descendant of the fifth ancient family that wants to strip Caleb's power.",/review/rw1572828/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2006,The_Defiant1,5," Don't Go With High Expectations
",This movie is essentially for teenagers. The cool boys in the school meet the cool girls. The boys have supernatural powers and it's all about being in control and appealing to the opposite sex. The plot itself is fairly shallow and offers no twists or turns.,/review/rw1572828/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2006,blackfractal,4," not as bad as expected
","Basic summary: Ipswitch used to be a community of witches and escaped the Salem witch hunts by forming a covenant of secrecy. The first born males descended from these families have supernatural powers, and must come to terms with the seductive, addictive nature of using those powers.",/review/rw1572828/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2006,adudewhoiscool,7," There are worst ways you can spend your Saturday or Sunday afternoon
","Going into seeing ""The Covenant,"" I had little expectations. I had expected this to be a big budget movie, full of action sequences and nothing else. Some parts of me believed it would be terrible, but other parts of me had hope because ""Underworld,"" the producers of ""The Covenant,"" was great. Honestly, I can say that I enjoyed it. There were flaws, but not enough for me to walk out or demand my money back.",/review/rw1572828/?ref_=tt_urv

9 September 2006,madhatterdru,6," Mindless, but Fun
","Anyone who expected this movie to be an amazing, intelligent film will be severely disappointed. However, from the trailer, I made a guess as to the general quality of the film. I was right, and I enjoyed myself.",/review/rw1572828/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2006,wimdall,7," The Idea had potential
","The idea of the movie was better than the movie itself, I thought. It did have potential, but didn't really embrace it as much as it should have. Basically, it's about four warlocks who are descent from four families from the 17th century who were able to harness the power of witchcraft. But when a fifth one shows up, stronger than all of them and seeking the power of the others, they must stop him before he kills them and everyone they care about. Think Underworld meets Highlander, and that's the basic mood of the movie. It's easy to think of this as an Underworld knock off, but it was actually better than that. The plot is predictable, and drags at times, and there is almost no character development. A lot of interesting subplots are touched upon, but never really explored, and the way they ended it, they obviously want sequels. Check it out, there's some pretty cool action scenes and an interesting story to back it up, but don't count on being blown away.",/review/rw1572828/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2006,BruddanChrist,5," Not bad for Renny Harlin
","I must admit this wasn't as bad as I expected. I've seen several Renny Harlin movies, none of which I've liked (in fact, I hated them). So, going into this one, I had little hope (if any). The story isn't the most originial thing I've ever heard of, but it's not a carbon copy of anything else. The story development is pretty straight-forward and predictable. The graphics are what you'd expect, as well. My main complaint with this film is what I call gratuitous dialogue: when people talk too much or think outloud to fill the audience in on what they're thinking. There's a lot of ""ha ha I'm so evil"" talk from the villain, as well. But, hey, if you can't have fun at the movies, why bother going? All in all, worth seeing at least once.",/review/rw1572828/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2008,PinkMascara,6," Would've been better as a TV show
","The more I watch this film, the more I like it, but the more frustrated I get at the fact that they tried to put such a complex plot into a 90-minute film.",/review/rw1572828/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2020,kosmasp,7," Star vehicle
","I guess I gave this some bonus points just because of the actors involved. I know someone who might even give this more than just one bonus point for having Sebastian Stan in it. And that is ok, overall though this is not something special. It is decent and it has some interesting effects.",/review/rw1572828/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2006,oshram-3,6," Better than you would expect
","The Covenant just goes to show that every once in a while you should take a chance on a movie you know almost nothing about. While it's isn't Shakespeare, it is a fairly well-done horror movie that doesn't rely on gore or shlock to work its 'magic.' The story follows four boys who are descended from families from the colony of Ipswich, Mass; they are the eldest son of the eldest son blah blah blah and they have inherited dark magical powers from their ancestors (who apparently were the only survivors of the Salem witch trials). The movie comes right out at the start and pretty much tells you just to accept the powers, that they aren't going to be explained, but you know, I'd rather have that than finding out it's all just a bunch of benevolent bacteria or something equally inane. Anyway, the boys are: the serious, responsible one, Caleb (Steven Strait), his slightly edgy best friend Pogue (Taylor Kitsch, looking for all the world like 7th Heaven's Barry Watson, even down to the hair), the guy who shows off with his powers, Reid (Toby Hemmingway), and a fourth guy who is sketched so briefly and says so little he's barely there at all.",/review/rw1572828/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2020,questl-18592,4," The Brotherhood of the Traveling Pants
","This is like the definition of a guilty pleasure movie. I know it's bad. Bad acting, bad graphics, the story is pure and total nonsense. There's nothing here worth the time and yet I weirdly enjoy the awfulness.",/review/rw1572828/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2007,fedor8,," This time fashion models play male witches.
","""No one really knows how the Power came to be. Not even the Book of Damnation recorded its beginning, but those who mastered it have always been hunted The families of Ipswich formed a Covenant of Silence bla bla bla"" After this intro, we suddenly see Take That. Or was it N'Synch? The Backstreet Boys, perhaps? Well, I don't know which of these they belong to, but one thing's for sure: the descendants of Salem are a boy-band. Can you tell them apart? I couldn't. If you can tell me which is which, I'd very much appreciate it. These boy-band boys looks so damn alike! Seriously now. Is this a horror movie or a film for teenie-boppers? It's sad that the (anyway weak) horror genre has been kidnapped by teens. And this is one of the teeniest I've seen so far. The movie is visually solid, but the cast is so bland, the acting so awful, that it was a trial finishing the movie. As bad as the cast was (after all, boy-bands and fashion models are rarely good actors) the absolute ""stand-out"" in this regard was the guy playing the villain, Sebastian Stan. This guy's overacting is right up there with the worst in the history of film. I have rarely seen someone make such annoying and silly grimaces in such a short space of time. What's worse, he has the most baby-face of all the boy-band baby-faces in the entire cast. I mean, it's a joke.",/review/rw1572828/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2006,DarkVulcan29,9," If you liked The Lost Boys and Charmed, then you' ll enjoy THE CONVENANT
","Some may compare this too certain shows like Buffy and Charmed, and maybe in some ways I'd compare it a little too. The movie was entertaining, it had great effects and great suspense. It starts out with group of young man led by Caleb(Steven Strait, best known as Warren Peace from Sky High(2005), who all belong to a covenant, and each one has supernatural powers. The power to do whatever your hearts desire. Three of the young men like to use the power for there personal game, except for Caleb who doesn't like to abuse his power. But now a certain someone has come to take it all away, and try to tear them apart. I'm surprised this ain't a T.V. show, But I guess after Buffy, Charmed, and Supernatural, I guess the producers thought this is better off being a movie instead. But still enjoyable non the less.",/review/rw1572828/?ref_=tt_urv

9 September 2006,kurayami_chan,5," not great, but I have seen worse...
","After seeing the previews for this, I went in expecting to see something like a slightly cheesier version of ""The Craft,"" but with boys, and I wasn't disappointed. At the most basic level, the premise is similar: four teenagers at a private school dabbling in supernatural power/magic. However, while ""The Craft"" is by no means a brilliant film, the writing and acting are both substantially better than what's seen in ""The Covenant."" ",/review/rw1572828/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2020,roxmewild,7," Not bad
","Not a lot of story to be honest it could have been developed a lot more!
However the special effects are superbly done and it is that what makes the movie watchable without them I would have given a 1 star
The acting is ok just a shame they couldn't make the story more interesting they opted for a very simple story and focussed on the special effects.",/review/rw1572828/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2007,SpookyAtTheDriveIn,1," Why are most teenagers so dumb?
","It seems whenever a mainstream film company wants to make a movies for teens it concentrates on only one thing: sex. Don't get me wrong, I'm no prude but the fact that these people seem to think getting my rocks off is all I'm interested in is highly offensive. Take The Convenant, a film that relies so heavily on you finding the main characters attractive it thinks it can get away without a plot and/or a script that wasn't written by a six year old. This is essentially The Craft with (supposedly) hot guys. And, yeah, that's it. It bored me to tears. Even my friend, who usually laps us crap films, hated it. It is really stunningly bad, to the extent where it can actually be funny. I would have laughed if it wasn't for the fact that several other females in cinema attendance seemed to be enjoying it. They were accompanied by several shifty looking guys who positively curled up and died when the (really cliché) boy on boy kiss happened towards the end. Watching them squirm really was the highlight of the film. I don't think mainstream, Hollywood cinema will ever put out good films for teenagers (or, indeed, for anyone) so I think I'll give up. Unless you're a teen who likes The Pussycat Dolls, thinks Paris Hilton is ""hot"" and watches MTV it's like some sort of wasteland. Life's hard when you're a fifteen year old who likes art house. :( P.S. Someone should have told the Director that not all teenage girls find would be boy band members ""totally HAWT LOL!!!111!!""",/review/rw1572828/?ref_=tt_urv
