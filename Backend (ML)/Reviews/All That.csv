10 October 2021,deloudelouvain,6," Rather disappointing.
","Compared to American Horror Story this one is pretty mediocre. There are only a couple stories that were worth a watch but nothing really mesmerizing. The other episodes were borderline boring and sometimes childish. I would have prefered another complete season of AHS than this one to be honest. Most of the actors were okay, but not all of them. The horror wasn't what I expected it to be, pretty lame in certain stories. I guess I will watch another season if there's one, just to see if it gets better but if it isn't then it will be over for me.",/review/rw7127249/?ref_=tt_urv

","Bad acting, bad writing. Such a waste of time!!! I love the AHS seasons but this is not even close. Just a disappointment.",/review/rw7127249/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2021,midnitepantera,2," ATROCIOUS!!! A lot of Pretty people, BADLY Acting at Acting BADLY!
","OMG!! I was thrilled to see Murder House again, but was swiftly and completely deflated by the lame story, bad writing, and Horrific acting (Which is the scariest thing about this show so far!)
The main character Scarlett, played by Sienna McCormick, is totally DEVOID of the charisma that Taissa Farmiga and Evan Peters brought to the table in AHS. Her character is a Monster, but not in a good way. It's a Blood Fest of the most Boring, Boring kind!! YAWN!!!",/review/rw7127249/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2021,avocadosrbad,2," Big no
","Thirty year old playing a teen, trying desperately to cling to the success of AHS. So you move into the murder house and find a latex sex suit. Totally try it on. Gross. I was so excited then I realized what this show is, a half a$$ attempt on the coat tails of the original. Lame.",/review/rw7127249/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2021,mr_bickle_the_pickle,5," Only 2 good episodes
","The only real good episodes are 5 titled Ba'al and 6 titled Feral. The rest have some good moments or ideas but otherwise mediocre. I think the reason why those 2 episodes i mentioned work is because they're more adult oriented stories and actually have good casts. I felt like the other episodes catered more towards a teen audience. Both in the sense of storyline but also with actors chosen, I mean seriously Kaia Gerber? She may be pretty but she cannot act if her life depended on it. And she gets way too much screen time as well. Also, can we give Murder House a rest already? It was nice seeing some characters back, but on the whole I think we can move on. I still like the overall premise of the show of having different anthology based episodes. Often times regular AHS will start off strong and quickly become muddled towards the middle when the writers clearly don't know what else to do with the storyline so this format provides a little more focus. So I think if they dropped the teen crap and didn't hire the latest Gen Z star, they could actually have a hit show on their hands again.",/review/rw7127249/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2021,rukstar69,4," Put it 2 bed.
",I used to be an Avid AHS fan. The last good thing that came from it was the Hotel season. Ever since then it has been nothing but crap...time to put this to bed.,/review/rw7127249/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2021,MustBeGus,8," Based on the first two episodes
","So far, this new series seems to lack the spark of the original series. Besides the more seasoned actors, the other acting seems robotic. It's as though I'm having a dream about American Horror Story; some of the people and scenery are familiar, but there's something off. This may be appealing to those CW fans who value style over substance, but for me I need more than just pretty people who kill. However, I want to be fair so I'll keep watching to see where this goes.",/review/rw7127249/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2021,bif-21647,1," Title of show says it all
","Horrible stories, horrendous acting! First story even had two episodes? What a joke! The actress playing Ruby in the first story is the worst acting I have watched on TV. Why come up with this when there is the original American Horror Story?",/review/rw7127249/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2021,andymaranam,1," Cheap tacky mess
","Absolutely appalling instalment to the AHS franchise. Cheaply made, poor z list acting and a script to compliment. I hope !! Season 10 is going to be alot better than this tripe. Want to watch a good series, watch twilight zone or tales of the unexpected rather than this pathetic mess.",/review/rw7127249/?ref_=tt_urv

",Title says it all. Actors who are all the same age playing parents and child. Stupid storyline. Nothing like a woman in her obviously late twenties playing a high schooler. I'd rather watch Grease.,/review/rw7127249/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2021,tlharrison-59546,1," Garbage
","Murder house has lined Murphy and Falchuks pockets 10x over. Who is asking for more murder house?? The first season of AHS was good but these guys just love to beat a dead horse. I had low expectations for this new show and those expectations were about right. No one in the first story was remotely likeable. The main girl was the absolute worst. Were we actually supposed to root for her? AHS brought some popularity to this genre when it was new and fresh but the show has been suffering in my opinion for years, especially when compared to shows like Haunting of Hill House. This new series isn't any better. Same old same old.",/review/rw7127249/?ref_=tt_urv

21 August 2021,bangel3322,," Wasted talent
","Some really talented actors in this show but unfortunately the episodes are pretty bad. Good ideas were there, just really badly executed. I really didn't see the need to revisit the murder house; they should have left it as it was. Out of 7 episodes, 3 were set in the murder house. I do like the ideas behind the storylines, they were interesting, but really lacking in the imagination that is usually brought. Of course we as an audience are going to compare it to AHS, and this seems lazy in comparison, I wonder....what was the point? I see it's been renewed but I will not be watching as I didn't enjoy it enough to continue. Best episode for me was probably Feral, followed by Drive-In. Ba'al was good but I found that to be far too predictable. The Christmas episode could have been good but ended up being complete trash.",/review/rw7127249/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2021,jlhebden-03668,2," 4 stars is a leap
","I had high expectations for this show because I love the original AHS. The only people with any acting chops were Matt Bomer, Gavin Creel and the woman who played the psychiatrist. The elderly ""teens"" were a joke. Kaia Gerber stick to modeling, I wouldn't even give her 1 star, Paris Jackson got maybe a 3. To put it bluntly, besides the three I listed, every other ""actor"" needs to go back to acting class. What is up with that? The season of Murder House on AHS was great, this was a sad rerun at best. The story was lazy and lacking any new material. Please bring back the better actors and stop being lazy with the writing. AHS fans were expecting the same quality given with the original show. If this is as good as it gets, toss it and stick with the original.",/review/rw7127249/?ref_=tt_urv

","Gosh where to start!! The acting, the story , the idea!(zero idea) , the production is cheap , immature teenagers act , it's a shame on AHS series , i finished the first 4 episodes and im not going further than that such a waste of time ,if you're a fan of AHS you won't like this one üëéüèºüëéüèº",/review/rw7127249/?ref_=tt_urv

","I cannot, for the life of me, see why there are so many reviews over 5 stars. This show, at most, is a 5/10 and that's just because they didn't film it on an Android. The acting is comical, the plot line is so confusing it's nauseating. Think Riverdale but just so much worse.",/review/rw7127249/?ref_=tt_urv
