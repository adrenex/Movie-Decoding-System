29 March 2004,tjcclarke,10," Masterful
","I have long thought that owning films on DVD or video is a waste of money - you watch them once and after that they are left to fester at the back of a cupboard. Occasionally I make an exception - some films simply cannot be fully appreciated on just one viewing. Every time I watch Leon is as gripping and enjoyable as the first. Sad, funny, violent, incredibly touching - few films manage to tick all the boxes and even fewer are about hitmen.",/review/rw8743009/?ref_=tt_urv

16 August 2016,Leofwine_draca,10," Besson's masterpiece - action cinema with real heart
","Despite having a mainly American cast and being set on the rough streets of New York, this is very much a French film, evident from the crew list at the end of the film. I'm always one to give foreign film-makers a try, as they usually offer up something a little bit more stylish and different than the usual formula. Take Lucio Fulci with his trademark 'hard' and nightmarish horror films, Dario Argento with his gory yet stylistic giallo films, or John Woo's violent, ballet-like action films.",/review/rw8743009/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2004,claudio_carvalho,10," A Perfect Chemistry
","In New York, León (Jean Reno) is an Italian professional hit-man, who loves drinking milk and has a plant as his best friend. His godfather and mentor is the mobster Tony (Danny Aiello), who loves León as if he were his own son, and his cold blood makes him a perfect killer. When Stansfield (Gary Oldman) and his gang executes the family of his twelve years old neighbor Mathilda (Natalie Portman), León lodges the girl in his place, beginning a weird friendship between a killer and a confused girl wishing revenge. When Mathilda finds who Stansfield is, she presses León to kill him. ",/review/rw8743009/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 1999,Insincere Dave,10," A shameful praise of a fantastic film.
","Leon (Jean Reno) is a tortured soul. He lives in squalor and misery, never truly happy or at peace with himself. After all, he is a hitman. He lives quietly from kill to kill, harming no-one whom he has not been paid to assassinate. He is a simplistic, childlike man who lives by his own set of morals but is troubled by them. The one thing he seems to fear above all else is change.",/review/rw8743009/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 1999,Methos-7,10," Gripping story with well-crafted characters
","Luc Besson's movie Léon (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler.  Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package.  Jean Reno plays a character named  Léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a ""cleaner"", or hit-man.  His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.",/review/rw8743009/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2004,Twinsen61,9," Visceral and intelligent - Besson's masterpiece
","Leon is one of the most emotionally intense movies ever made. French director Luc Besson uses everything: actors, music, camera angles, lighting to create an unique experience - ""It's not realism, it's not naturalism - it's heightened reality"" as Gary Oldman very well put it.",/review/rw8743009/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2003,Gjay2,7," a symphony in film
","luc besson will never top this movie. This is his benchmark, his classical composition. Look at the precise, intricate scenes. It's a symphony in cinema. Straight off, it's action. Intelligently shot, and scripted. It makes everything that follows hard to live upto. But it does so easily. It's stylish without being showy, it's deep without being sentimental. And it's just hugely enjoyable. Seeing the friendship between newly orphaned mathilda and skilled assasin leon bloom, is tenderly done. At risk of slipping into a sappy bond, besson keeps it easy on the emotions, without coming off as shallow.",/review/rw8743009/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,saikatsamanta,10," A Tale of Revenge, Love & Life...
","One of the most iconic Action films of all time, this story is about a ruthless hitman Jean Reno and his next door neighbour, 12 year old Natalie Portman who lives in an abusive household and how a tragedy makes this two tormented souls find each other, love and life again. Luc Besson directs this one with plenty of bloody and uber stylish action scenes and some really touching moments. The music is pretty damn fantastic and the editing is crisp. Jean Reno owns his role with stonecold attitude but also possess this awkward innocence. Portman gives probably the greatest performance from a Child Actor, playing a kid hungry for love but has grown up too quickly amidst crime. Gary Oldman goes off the hinges, playing a Crooked DEA cop, belting out one iconic line after another. You can watch this film again and again, a Masterpiece !!!",/review/rw8743009/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 1998,Sickfrog,10," A Brilliant Conflict
","This film, better known in the U.S. as ""The Professional"", is a wonderful and intense film. Jean Reno plays his role as a ""cleaner"" with incredible subtlety. Leon tries to keep his emotions completely suppressed, yet Matilda (in an extraordinary performance by a young Natalie Portman, who is destined to become a very powerful actress into her adult life) bring out in him a new-found joy for life that accompanies his growing paternal instincts. But, the most dynamic element of this film is undeniably Gary Oldman's performance as a wildly sadistic and crooked DEA agent with his own narcotic-induced demons. His obsessions eventually lead him to the brink of absolute madness in his hunt for the cleaner. Truly, this is Oldman's finest performance to date, worthy of Oscar glory, though sadly forgotten. And so, Luc Besson did indeed top his triumph of ""La Femme Nikita"" by far with this masterpiece. Though, I cannot exactly praise his most recent effort with the sci-fi misfire, ""The Fifth Element.""",/review/rw8743009/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2000,cdsmith-2,10," Very well executed
","This film was absolutely amazing.  I have spent hours re-watching various scenes and noticing all the perfection with which they are acted and directed.  It's not the violence or action sequences that make this movie so great (although they are well done...), but rather moments like where Mathilda knocks on Leon's door.  It would be so easy to just film the door opening, but instead we see light illuminating Natalie Portman's face, symbolizing something angelic.  And the moment has so much more meaning.",/review/rw8743009/?ref_=tt_urv

","An interview with Anne Parillaud, in the Evening Standard, 24.8.90, it was said that the message of Nikita is not one of violence but the idea is that people who are full of despair and missing love are not alone.",/review/rw8743009/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2005,rustysettler,10," Excellent, smart action film.
","Luc Besson's ""The Professional"" is sort of a companion piece to his international breakthrough hit ""La Femme Nikiti"", and in many ways it's an even better film. It raises the stakes of Besson's playful women-with-guns theme by making the heroine a 12-year-old, played by a then unknown Natalie Portman. Jean Reno is excellent as her assassin trainer and surrogate father. Oldman is completely over the top in one of his best bad-guy roles, obsessed with both Beethoven and butchery. As a gritty, suspenseful thriller, this film won't leave action fans feeling cheated, but the film is so much more than that. At the center of ""The Professional"" is a wonderful father and daughter-like relationship between two damaged strangers who find solace in each other.",/review/rw8743009/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10," Intense, gripping, stylish and poignant with one of the best feature debuts ever
","Luc Besson's film Leon:The Professional is a superb one. Visually, it is very stylish, with striking location work, atmospheric lighting and really authentic and bold cinematography. The soundtrack also does very well in enhancing the mood of each scene, and Besson's direction is faultless.",/review/rw8743009/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2005,Quinoa1984,9," A thrilling crime film, in deep touch and care with the characters- Besson and Portman's best work to date
","I sensed that Luc Besson (director of The Fifth Element and La Femme Nikita) was, like Tarantino and many, many others before him, borrowed elements from various films and genres to create their own voice in the film. With Leon, I sensed him alluding to the crime films of France (i.e. Melville), Hong-Kong (i.e. Woo), and America (i.e. Scorsese), and making it into his own special brand for the story and characters. That his style visually is as compelling helps a great deal. The international version (which is the one I saw) is a little grittier, and more suggestive, than the version most American audiences saw in 1994 and on cable. But it is also a must-see if you are planning to see the film. It's not a long movie, though it gives a good many details in its story.",/review/rw8743009/?ref_=tt_urv

14 December 2014,Horst_In_Translation,8," Great film with one of the most memorable duos in film history
","""Lèon"" is a 1994 movie written and directed by Luc Besson and named after its central character played by Jean Reno. The film went almost completely under the radar in terms of awards recognition outside of France, but its reputation steadily rose over the years and it is now pretty much considered a classic. Besson was in his mid-30s when he made this movie, but already had a respectable résumé including a French and English version of ""Nikita"". For Reno and Oldman this is probably still the most famous work (not counting Oldman's efforts in the Batman movies) and for Portman it goes right along with other blockbusters like ""V for Vendetta"" and ""Black Swan"", which gave her the Oscar. I am still a bit disappointed Reno was not present at the ceremony. For Portman, Mathilda was the first role in a movie. Also in the film is Danny Aiello as a friend to Léon. His role wasn't clear early on to me as it seemed unsure what he was doing with the money, but as the film went on it showed that he was pretty close to Léon.",/review/rw8743009/?ref_=tt_urv

","Leon is a cleaner for his boss, it's like removing bits of debris when you floss, a variety of tools, he always plays by his set rules, now he's taken in a girl he's come across. She purports to be 18 but she's a child, had to grow up quick with a family that's quite wild, now they have wounds, that won't be healed, after messing with Stansfield, that's left her quite annoyed and somewhat, slightly riled. It's a story of revenge and adolescence, of walking a fine line that may cause offence, but there's chemistry and connection, performances played to perfection, quite original, without too much pretence.",/review/rw8743009/?ref_=tt_urv
