22 February 2019,spasek,10," A Virtually Unparalleled Series in the History of Television!
","I have been watching movies and shows for over forty years. And, yes, this show is THAT good! After watching ""Descendants of the Sun"" only a couple of years ago, I was wondering how long it would be before another grand series came about; a series that resonates with the heart and soul; a series with a crisp story and fantastic performances by the actors. And along came ""Mr. Sunshine.""",/review/rw4247726/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2018,ackermanle,10," Hollywood should be envious
","Do not let the cheesy title of this series fool you. This is extraordinary from many points of view. Historically, it is based on an actual setting, something very few people in this country would know about Korea, Japan and the USA. Within that framework, the clash of cultures, where values are different and honor prevails. The aesthetics of the production are something to marvel at. And then, the characters, who behave in accordance to strict rules surely strange to us behaving in ways that are, ultimately, quite fascinating. The love relation develops strangely, slowly and far from any courtship you could ever imagine. That gets performed by the two main characters in rather fascinating fashion as well. I do not recall seeing a picture where a still face and a minimal movement could unload so much expression. Actress Tae-ri Kim packs more beauty and feeling in still silence than any actress I can recall; she deserves stardom just for such incredible skill.
I have seen five episodes, and I am mesmerized.",/review/rw4247726/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2020,wheatley-20230,10," Absolutely Captivating!
",Being British I struggled somewhat with the array of characters with unrecognisable names in episode 1 but I stuck with it and was hooked by the end of episode 2. Each further installment dragged me deeper into this enchanting love story set against momentous historical events.,/review/rw4247726/?ref_=tt_urv

","The show is set in early 20th century Korea, few years away from being occupied by the Japanese Empire. The ruling Joseon dynasty has finally opened up their ports to Western powers and modernization is happening at an unprecedented pace for historically xenophobic Koreans.

8 August 2020,ghcheese,10," Just Amazing
",I just started watching Korean shows. This one is so good. I could go on and on. I'm telling you to watch this because it is so damn good. Maybe Hollywood should start watching Korean shows. They like to steal ideas. Steal the idea of making a good movie.,/review/rw4247726/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2018,easternautumn,10," Great show with beautiful cinematography
","I am a huge fan of Korean shows, and this one is no exception. It is a beautiful story, with just as beautiful cinematography and rich characters. As others have written, the first episode kind of goes all over the place, but it is worth sticking around, because you basically figure out who is who in the second episode.",/review/rw4247726/?ref_=tt_urv

17 May 2020,alaningle7,9," This is your fight, I'm only helping you
",Very enjoyable series telling the early struggle of Korea to overcome Japanese influence and occupation. As with many Korean dramas we have lots of strong characters with fascinating back stories. All 3 male leads love a Korean noble lady who is also a freedom fighter and only one can win her heart. The series is well filmed and acted and the director wrings out the emotions very well. As it should be with all good series I was very sad to finish it.,/review/rw4247726/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2018,facesofine,10," Don't let the title fool you--watch it and be rewarded with a great show!
","Best show I've seen in a long time. Great acting, dialogue, story, scenery, cinematography, oh my! the list goes on. I'm in love with all 5 leads. They had great chemistry between each other. The characters were perfectly cast. And I almost broke my tv wanting to kill the villains (btw, played by wonderful actors who brought me to the brink of insanity). I was waiting fervently each week for the new episodes to air. It was torture not being able to binge-watch. Now that it's over, I think I'm going to have withdrawal symptoms develop soon.",/review/rw4247726/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2019,Geeta352,10," Bravo!
","The absolute best KDrama I have ever seen. Everything about it was perfect: the cast, the setting, the heart-breaking storyline, the fact that this series was based on history. I cried many, many tears watching this series - and I laughed at times too;it's just that good! What a beautiful, courageous story!",/review/rw4247726/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2018,droche-49966,10," Please get past the title and watch one of the best K-drama's ever
","I just finished watching the last episode and am already wishing it hadn't ended. The show was beautifully done, whether the acting, costumes, music or the best, cinematography. Episode 1 was a little confusing but you quickly settled into the story and characters in episode 2 and from then on, you are enthralled and transported to the turn of the century, Korea. I surely wish the title of the show was something a bit different especially as it had no real meaning. It may keep others from watching. It would be their loss. ",/review/rw4247726/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2018,kristinleanabunch,10," Gorgeous Cinematography!
","We just got done with the first episode, and my husband and I enjoyed it immensely. The cinematography work is stunning, the battle scenes are well choreographed and realistic, and there is some great acting in this show. The story line is shaping up to be an interesting one. There is a lot going on in this first episode, and you may find yourself frustrated at first, trying to figure out the timeline and characters, as there are flash forwards and more than one story line, but it looks at least for now, that they will start merging fairly quickly. I highly recommend this show.",/review/rw4247726/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2018,droche-49966,10," More like a movie than a TV series
","Beautifully filmed with a great cast and wonderful writing, even with sub-titling. Very apparent that a lot of money was spent filming this. K-dramas are so much better than most American shows now and this is a prime example of a K-drama. Intrigue, action, romance, with some comedy thrown in. Byung-Hun Lee does an outstanding job with his acting, in three languages to boot!",/review/rw4247726/?ref_=tt_urv

15 November 2020,superstore88,8," A Historical Epic Drama with Touch of Romance..
","I just finished this very long KDrama which is 1-1/2 times longer than the others. I'm not giving this show a very high score nor a low score...it's just about normal satisfaction to me. I find it quite dragging because of the long episodes.. It would have been fast paced if was reduced to the standard 16 episodes...so many scenes can be cut....There was no suspense at all that you will be eager to continue and watch the next episodes...it's tantamount to a boring show....The romance between the two stars seems to be awkward like a January-December or a father-daughter affair...the guy is 50 and the girl is very young at 30....I don't find it sweet or romantic...What I like about the show is the Cinematography, Costumes and I like the music theme Greensleeves. The show is realism and not fantasy and the use of flashbacks is limited only unlike other shows which consumes most of the time using flashbacks.....On the over-all, it's a good show and recommended if you have patience to watch 24 episodes.",/review/rw4247726/?ref_=tt_urv

",There are no words to even describe how much I loved this series. I read in some of the reviews that they didn't think the two main characters had chemistry. I couldn't disagree more. Their chemistry was mesmerizing. I thought the casting was terrific. This was the first K drama I have ever watched but it won't be the last.,/review/rw4247726/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2021,qck1,10," Quite a message
","I know a lot about history, and how imperialistic the Japanese were for the first half of the 20th century. People forget that 14 million Chinese were killed with the same sort of imperialism that is show in this series where Japan targeted Korea. I look at Japan today and I see a country that seems more western than other East Asian countries, and has more acceptance by the west than other East Asian countries. The evil of the Japanese that is shown in this film is the evil of Western imperialism from the time of Columbus to the present time with the United States. And I see a Japan today that seems to be scared and antagonistic towards China, and nervous about Korea, and maybe for good reason considering the evil the Japan perpetuated upon the region. I see the patriotism and willingness to die for country of the Korean terrorists, or are they patriots? In the US we like to call them terrorists. That Korea has managed to survive through the centuries as a fairly small country says a lot about its people, and a country that was between the extremely expansionistic Japanese and Russians, and the Chinese. The way people that have been alienated against their country of origin still surrender their lives for their country, or really their culture. The film has an Korean American officer, and shows the country of the US apathetic towards the plight Korean people, but the US was one of the significant Imperialistic powers Not much happiness in this series since pretty much everyone dies,",/review/rw4247726/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2019,winstow,10," A masterpiece on the beauty of the Joseon
","Probably the people who wrote negative reviews have misunderstood the true meaning of the story. This is not a romantic TV series, this is simply a genuine hymn to the beauty and strength of the Joseon. The romantic story between the lovers is only the frame of a splendid picture depicting the Joseon of the years 1870-1920. The real protagonists are the emotions and the ardor of those who have the strength to fight for the survival of their homeland, even at the cost of their lives.",/review/rw4247726/?ref_=tt_urv

13 August 2018,jfp661,9," Give this Korean story a chance
","Yes, this is a romance but a wonderful non-gratuitous love story. Pact with historical themes, very interesting characters, class warfare, revenge and absolution. What I enjoyed most was the pacing of the story, it rarely gets ""stuck"". Also the cinematography was outstanding, capturing the highlights of the story and the beautiful set locations. I highly recommend listening to this in its native language because the rhythms of actors voices would be ruined by any ""dub"". Cannot say enough on how much I enjoy ""waiting"" for the weekends to get the next episodes of this show.",/review/rw4247726/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2018,daybidcho,10," An epic Korean Drama not to be missed!
","This is an epic drama loosely based on the history of Korea from the perspectives of different but engaging characters. It is set in the time where Joseon (Korea) is fought over between different countries with America and Japan. The main character is played by Byung-Hun Lee, who is a phenomenal Korean actor and opposite of his role is Tae-ri Kim who is a newer actress. Byung-Hun Lee has many years of experience and is a well known Korean actor and he has appeared in numerous American films such as G.I. Joe and R.E.D. Both the actors bring fierce intensity to their roles with their well acted scenes and show such emotion through their lines, looks and even their stares. The supporting cast is also superb as they tell their own stories in this conflicted time. All in all the drama has great production value and truly keeps you mesmerized through it's weekly episodes. If you are a fan of Korean dramas or even if you aren't familiar with them, then this is a great series that you can watch.",/review/rw4247726/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2018,malucitab,9," Every frame is perfect
",This is the most beautifully done series I've ever seen. Each frame of each shot was like a painting. The story is your typical historical k drama but because the cinematography is so on point it becomes like a beautiful story book.

25 August 2018,utopianwizard-22-274383,10," Exquisite acting
","I have thoroughly enjoyed this film series. My wish would be for it to be in English. But my fear is that it would ruin the consistent poetry of the Korean language. It's eloquent even as it uses contemporary expressions in the subtitles. It would be interesting to hear the story in its historical context. For example, the series Deadwood uses such language that matches perfectly with the expressiveness of the language used during the pioneering era in the American westward expansion. The whole soul of a language is so very important and difficult, and Shakespeare proves that easily. There are long pauses in the dialogue which tries to emphasize the subtextual meanings in both the language as well as the scene itself. And the cinematography is elegant and filled with gracious wisdom, making the long pauses worth the wait/weight of the meanings between words. It is both an intellectual and spiritual experience. Some may say it is soap opera, but this is a masterpiece of historical costume drama with the most eloquent balance between all aspects of making a film work. The actors are so perfectly matched as they experience one another in character. My favorite balancing act in the project is the consistent humour that I've begun to recognize in great epic Asian film projects. Jackie Chan comes to mind when a dramatic moment astonishingly becomes the Keystone Cops and the wonder of Charlie Chaplin. The character actors are genius as their dialogues expand the story using the most powerful and long-lasting aspect of film theory/storytelling. These moments are climactic and as such get us ready for the next constellation of plot structuring. I guess I'm trying to say that I feel the intensity of effort and belief going into the project, and that alone makes it worth watching.",/review/rw4247726/?ref_=tt_urv
