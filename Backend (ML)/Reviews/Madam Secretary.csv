","I wasn't expecting much from 'Unfaithful' as I thought it would be another 'The Perfect Murder' type thriller. But 'Unfaithful' is so much more than what 'The Perfect Murder' could ever be. It's deeper. It's darker. It has so many psychological layers. It's more a character driven drama rather than than plot driven. The plot may not be exactly original but it's the influence of it on the characters is what 'Unfaithful' is about. The film is very engaging as we witness the psychological effects of the consequences of Connie's decision. Lyne deserves praise for his excellent artistic execution. I loved how he used symbolism (such as metaphors and pathetic fallacies) and shows great attention to detail as is evident in the visuals. The editing is clear cut. Biziou's cinematography is great and Kaczmarek's score sets the tone. Note that during the key moments, when the main characters are conversing, the background music is absent. Richard Gere and Olivier Martinez, though a little too old, do decent jobs. However, it is Diane Lane who gives a career-defining performance. Her sublime portrayal of the incredibly sexy Connie is awesome. She carries the film. It is Diane Lane and Adrian Lyne's film. 'Unfaithful' is a magnificent engaging artistic drama. I don't understand why some were even harsh enough to call it soft-core. Do they even know the definition of soft-core? Others seem to have a problem with why Connie, who had the perfect life, would have an affair. But I feel it necessary to stress that nobody is perfect and therefore the perfect life does not exist. Connie's affair wasn't a planned thing. Who knows why it happened? Perhaps she wanted to feel younger, perhaps she was bored, or perhaps she wanted more from her husband. I don't think it was with the intention to ruin her 'perfect' life. There doesn't have to be a clear reason...as affair's don't necessarily happen for the best reasons.",/review/rw1652497/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2004,bondgirl6781,," A film about human choices, lusts, and consequences
","Adrian Lyne is fascinated by human sexuality and he presents it in a way that is adult but without being pornographic. Unfaithful tells the story of a perfectly normal and happy couple, Edward (Richard Gere) and Connie (Diane Lane). They look ideal: he is a very successful businessman, she is a wonderful and loving wife and mother to their young son, and they live in a beautiful home. Everything is perfect until one day Connie goes into the city to shop for her son's birthday party when a wind storm makes her bump into a handsome French librarian/book collector named Paul (Olivier Martinez). She is injured and unable to get a taxi, Paul helps her and when he was unable to get her into a taxi he offers her to come upstairs to his apartment to use a telephone and bandage up her injury. Connie is immediately attracted and fascinated by the handsome stranger, but nothing happens and she goes home but she cannot stop thinking about Paul. She goes back and finds him. In the second encounter with Paul nothing happens but she still cannot stop thinking about him and it seems very obvious to Paul that he is also attracted to her. In the third encounter, Paul and Connie have sex and it is the beginning of a tumultuous affair that will set a chain reaction of guilt, jealousy, obsession, heartbreak, and murder.",/review/rw1652497/?ref_=tt_urv

11 May 2002,mattymatt4ever,8," Very intriguing!
","Is this a ""great"" film?  Is this a Oscar-winning masterpiece?  I honestly do not know.  I was so engrossed in the plot that I didn't have time to judge artistic value.  I was glued to my seat from start to finish.  This is sassy, sexy thriller that delivers the goods and then some.  But the actors make it work.  The chemistry between each of the characters is electric. ",/review/rw1652497/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2003,mppullar,10," Ludicrously underrated
","Every now and then, I read a review of a film which is so drastically different to my own reaction to it that I wonder if we have watched the same film. This is the case for almost EVERY review of ""Unfaithful"". Aside from the occasional positive comment that I have read by other IMDB users, and the glowing review given by Margaret Pommeranz on the (Australian) ""Movie Show"" (four and a half stars, if I remember correctly), this film seems to have met with either negative or ambivalent reactions from everyone. And this surprises me immensely, because I was overwhelmed by it. I expected quite a good, slightly arty film with good performances (particularly from Diane Lane, who really impressed me in Coppola's ""The Cotton Club""). What I got was a film which I think will be one of my favourites for many years to come.",/review/rw1652497/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2002,LebowskiT1000,8," Very Interesting Film
","The story in this film is pretty much exactly what I expected.  I really liked that they made Richard Gere out to be a perfect husband and a very loving husband.  You really feel for his character when he finds out about the affair.  I thought Diane Lane did a great job as always and looks better than ever, she is one gorgeous woman.  I thought Oliver Martinez did a good job too, I'd never heard of him till seeing this film.",/review/rw1652497/?ref_=tt_urv

","Early in the film a violent wind storm in Manhattan (a stunning piece of cinema) brings Connie a New York suburban house wife in collision with Paul a book seller (Olivier Martinez) He notices her knee is bleeding so he invites her up to his nearby apartment so that he can dress the injury. Uncertain at first, she relents and climbs the stairs and enters his world of books. The conversation is general. The chemistry is simmering.",/review/rw1652497/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2004,kylebengel,," Drama as Art...
","I have read alot of reviews here that expressed displeasure for this film based on the notion that this was basically ""softcore porn for housewives"" and had nothing new to offer it's audience.  Ok, granted; this is not the most original film/script ever written, but I think that many reviews (both Professional and Ametuer alike) have missed the point of this film. Behind the obvious guise of a morality tale showing what can happen if you stray from your marital vows, there is a rather amazing piece of art to be seen. This film is not about marital infedelity, but, rather, about DRAMA.  This is what we in the Theater refer to as Drama As Art, meaning that the plot is less important than the impact that the various plot points have on the characters, creating more and more and more drama as the story unfolds. As is the great ballets or stage plays ('Giselle', 'Whose Afraid of Virginia Wolf', 'Swan Lake' 'A Streetcar Name Desire'), the DRAMA is the star of the production, not the actors or the plot lines.",/review/rw1652497/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2002,DunnDeeDaGreat,8," A summer blockbuster for adults
","Adrian Lyne has succuced once again in making a film about the consquences of an affair. While the trailer leads you to belive the film is like Fatal Attraction it's nothing like it. The acting by Richard Gere is some of his best work in a long time, but the tour deforce performance in he movie belongs to Diane Lane. Lane gives an Oscar worthy performace as the wife of Gere. Diane Lane sexuality in the film is so sensual and awe insprining I would cheat with her my damn self. I highly reccomned this film.",/review/rw1652497/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2002,whirligig,8," not quite what I expected!

1 June 2002,raysond,," Something we had ALREADY seen before
","For much of his career,director Adrian Lyne has clearly had sex on the brain,or thoughts of eroticial porno,turning out huff and puff features both good(the Oscar winning Fatal Attraction and the controversial Lolita)and bad(9 1/2 Weeks and Indecent Proposal,the latter firmly cemented as one of the worst films of its decade). Happily,Unfaithful rests more toward the upper end of the spectrum;based on a 1969 French film by Claude Chabrol(La Femme Infidele),the movie sports a continental demeanor that seems wholly appreciate,but as a whole we have seen this kind of adulterated behavior several times before. Diane Lane's standout performance is what elevates the first half,which could be easily dismissed as a straight-to-cable soaper or straight-to-video softcore porno assembly. A well to do housewife seemingly content with her husband(Richard Gere,is one of his best works here and one of his finest performances since the latter part of the 80's and early 90's),her son (Erik Per Sullivan),and her home in a quaint New York(upscale Manhattan) suburb,unexpectedly enters into a torrid affair with a French book dealer(Oliver Martinez-who looks like something out of grocery store paperback novel and one of those daytime TV soap hunks). Lane's complex portrayal of a woman caught between the borders of reason and risk is simply smashing,yet eventually she's not required to carry the picture by herself,as the second half heads off in some interesting and unexpected directions that ultimately lead to the wonderful amibiguous final shot. Unfaithful works for viewers willing to put some thought into it that only works for those who want cheap thrills will probably be disappointed,but in all its a illusion of eternal bliss that will find this easily a satisfying picture.",/review/rw1652497/?ref_=tt_urv

9 June 2015,anaconda-40658,5," No Faith in This Film.
","Unfaithful (2002): Dir: Adrian Lyne / Cast: Richard Gere, Diane Lane, Oliver Martinez, Erik Per Sullivan, Michelle Monaghan: Painful yet well crafted film regarding unfaithfulness. Richard Gere and Diane Lane play a married couple whose marriage is threatened when she has an affair with a bookseller played by Oliver Martinez. Predictable and dark especially when murder factors. Even a visit from the police seems recycled and obvious. Adrian Lyne's films often address sexual consequence but the sex scenes seem more as a peep show. Better examples of his work are Indecent Proposal and 9 ¬Ω Weeks but this is not one of his better films thanks to its emphasis on being a peep show. In the first the sexual tension is high but not shown. In the second it is displayed in multiple variety to back its subject matter. Here it just seems like an excuse to place two actors in hot sexual action. Gere and Lane deliver on frustration and guilt despite being props for a dim cliffhanger. Martinez is charming and seductive and ultimately too abrupt. Other roles play for convenience over purpose. As with most Lyne films, this one is well made in terms of locations and lighting but its message might have worked more effectively had the affair been less of a peep show and more about motives and consequence. As a result it is more about steamy sex than the consequences of infidelity. Score: 5 ¬Ω / 10",/review/rw1652497/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2002,Aidan McGuinness,," Enjoyable drama/thriller helped by a great Lane performance
","This is a movie about being unfaithful. you probably guessed that. The unfaithful person is one Connie Sumner (Diane Lane), wife to Edward (Richard Gere). Edward is actually a nice guy, and a loving father to their child Frank (`Malcolm in the Middle' star Erik Par Sullivan). Nonetheless Connie is not content with her somewhat staid home life. One day - caught in a Storm of Foreshadowing! - she is thrown into the life of a Frenchman Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez). He is much younger than her and gradually tempts her into getting with them. Connie must decide whether she can live with this secret affair, or will her misdeeds strike back!! Dum dum DA!",/review/rw1652497/?ref_=tt_urv

Then the winds of change starts to blow literally, and she collides with Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) in the city. He helps her out with her skinned knee.

4 May 2002,peterpemberton1,10," A deeply haunting and provocative masterpiece. Stunningfilm-making.
","Whoever thought that director Adrian Lyne and star Richard Gere were finished needs to see this haunting and provocative film. Because this is a stunner that will put both back on the map - big time. For all their star power though, it is the female star Diane Lane who must take huge credit for making this such an effective movie.",/review/rw1652497/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2002,Buddy-51,," intriguing but flawed (spoilers)
","Like his earlier smash hit, `Fatal Attraction,' Adrian Lyne's `Unfaithful' is a cautionary tale for would-be adulterers.  More muted and less of a rabble-rouser than the previous film, this new work provides generally good, solid entertainment within the confines of its overworked genre.",/review/rw1652497/?ref_=tt_urv

","I wonder where did Mr. Lyne and Mr. Sargent live. Are they confusing Chicago, the Windy City, with Manhattan? Sorry, but as a native of this city, I've never seen anything like the wind storm at the beginning of the film. It's a very silly premise to throw the 2 would-be-lovers together. At any rate, can anyone tell me what was Connie Sumner doing in Soho buying party things that she would have been able to get (much cheaper too) at the nearest mall? It just doesn't make sense, as well as the rest of the film.",/review/rw1652497/?ref_=tt_urv

",This film is not what you expect it to be. The trailers have you thinking it's another thriller along the lines of A Perfect Murder or Fatal Attraction but it is much.much more than that. Unfaithful is a superbly directed and superbly acted character study and the tragic consequences of someone's actions. It sounds very familiar but it isn't. It's a first class and very absorbing thriller with a stand-out performance by award winner Diane Lane. In fact it is Diane Lane's unforgettable performance which lifts Unfaithful from superb to greatness. A new classic of the genre has been delivered and delivered with style and heart.,/review/rw1652497/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2002,Darkest_Rose,10," Unforgettable And Moving
","Unfaithful is a powerful story about passion, desire and trust. Connie Sumner has a pretty good life, a husband to who she has been married for 11 years and a bright kid, charlie, who is nine years old. One day Connie is downtown and the strong wind knockes her down and she hurts her knee. Suddenly, this young attractive man helps her and invites her to his house for a band-aid and a drink. This seemed kinda funny and naive to me, not most people just go up to stranger's houses like that but anyways. The young man introduces himself as Paul and that he is a bookdealer. Nothing happens yet, but you can tell there are some sparks among them, especially when Connie grabs a book and Paul tell's her to read one of the lines, which was "" be happy for this moment, this moment is your life"". Connie exits and in the further days she begins to think more and more about paul, not being able to concentrate on anything else. She calls him finally and they meet at his house and there begins their first sexual encounter. That's when the lying begins and Connie starts going to his house more often, every day even for a quick love making. Her Husband, Edward Sumner played by Richard Gere starts getting suspicious and wonders where Connie's head is at. The affair gets out of hand and then the jealousy starts and it turns out ugly. This is a very moving movie about what an affair can do to a family. Diane Lane gives an Amazing Performance, Oscar Worth. I would give Unfaithful 9/10",/review/rw1652497/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2020,cpowchuk-14765,9," Good story about the price we pay for infidelity.
","I watched this move (again) last night and really enjoyed it. The obsession the wife has with her ""younger"" lover is believable. The reaction of the husband is understandable. What annoyed me the most was the AGE DIFFERENCE.",/review/rw1652497/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2003,TxMike,," It was an ill wind that knocked over the bicycle.
","""Unfaithful"" begins with static shots of the Sumner's nice suburban home, and about 1:20 into the first scene we see the wind knock over their son's bicycle. This is, metaphorically, what the whole film is about. As the title suggests, it is a story about infidelity and guilt, observing the human condition when things, thought impossible only moments before, go in unpredicted directions. In a theme explored in different ways in films such as ""Sliding Doors"" and ""Run, Lola, Run"", this movie's story is set up by a missed connection, the failure to flag down a NYC taxi on a very windy day. Had a cab stopped, it would simply have been ""thank you"", and everything subsequent would have been 'normal' for Connie and Edward. Diane Lane as Constance and Richard Gere as her husband, Edward, are at the top of their form here. The film editing is very interesting, during key scenes cutting between what Constance and Edward are doing at the very same time, in very different circumstances. A very fine movie which examines the real concept that most of us have triggers that can turn us to a dark side.",/review/rw1652497/?ref_=tt_urv
