18 August 2021,JRH87,5," L is for lost
","I'm biased in writing this since I'm comparing the original but one can't help do that when some of the same cast members are in this one. What I loved about the first one was it's rawness, it's artiness, it's intellect. No one, besides Bette maybe, was established and you're watching this group of gay friends find their way in life with all the drama in tow. Some storylines were risqué for the time, which made it all the more interesting. Cut to now and all of our beloved characters are well established, living these high flying lives that just seems so untrue to the characters that they were and it takes away a certain quality and relatability from them. We're now expected to find this in these new characters but the writing just doesn't quite live up to that same quirky standard. I understand this is a different show and perhaps they had to sell it that way to bring it back, perhaps they felt they needed a younger generation for a younger audience to relate to. It's not a bad show and the new characters aren't terrible, but there's a certain depth missing here. There was more to the L Word than affairs, it was about power dynamics, whilst at the same time being goofy and at times off the wall. GQ seems lost in a soap opera style drama and that comedic aspect seems absent. Which for an audience still deprived of real representation in the mainstream, might not seem that bad, but for others expecting more than this, you'll likely be disappointed.",/review/rw5350944/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2019,brookevale,3," Something's wrong
","I loved the original L Word so much so that I watched all seasons three times. Something felt off from the first scene of Generation Q. Bad writing? Bad directing? Bad set design or filming? I missed the homegrown feeling of the original L Word. I just didn't feel connected to any of the new characters or the former characters reprising roles. It didn't flow like the former series. I am not a critic. I can only share my experience. I couldn't wait for the former series' new episodes. It took me five tries to finish the first episode of Genetation Q. I don't know what it will take for me to get motivated to watch episode 2. Maybe they should've kept the show's main location at Bette's sister's coffee shop. I think younger viewers unfamiliar with the original L Word might receive this new series better than those of us who tuned in for season 1, episode 1 from the day it premiered.",/review/rw5350944/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2021,roomrent,1," The Original Formula worked so well.
","I loved the ORIGINAL L. Word. I loved being transported to the beautiful lush green environment of L. A. with its sunny coffee shops and backyard swimming pools. I missed watching the day to day drama that took place between unique and relatable characters who introduced us to the creative world of magazine writers, art directors and sports figures. Everyone was so much fun to watch as they gathered in their favourite coffeehouse each with their own story.",/review/rw5350944/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2020,romanaclay,1," Sad Downward Spiral
","This is my fourth rewrite and probably my last. After season 1 of the reboot, I mused about giving it 5 or 6 stars and ended up with 7 because despite its many flaws, I couldn't turn away. Season 2 does nothing to address those flaws and only amplifies them.",/review/rw5350944/?ref_=tt_urv

6 March 2020,Herufied,1," Snoozefest

17 January 2020,plasticanimalz,3," Yet Another Bad Reboot
","While Roswell: New Mexico is one of the worst reboots (and worst TV shows I've ever seen), Gen Q is a close second, along with also being probably one of the worst shows I've seen, period. And I've seen a lot. Being a big fan of the original L Word, it pains me to see it go down in the fiery flames of a sinking ship. Basically, all I can hope for is they cancel it and maybe try it again with more competent hands than the newbie, Marja-Lewis Ryan, who has virtually almost no experience. Who in their right mind hires a women with ZERO TV experience to showrun a series? That doesn't even happen for straight white males in the industry who get everything handed to them on a silver platter, so, I have to ask, how does a women with zero TV experience and only an ounce of indie film experience end up creating a show? Showtime really must be penniless if other than three of the original cast, they're hiring virtual nobodies, as well as people with no experience. And, it REALLY shows. Painfully.",/review/rw5350944/?ref_=tt_urv

12 December 2019,toh-86045,4," Disappointed in the writing acting and directing
","Was the budget cut. Please give me a good explanation for this final product. Cheesy bad soap opera music during scenes make this feel like a cheap knock off. Where are my directors from the original show. The story line for the new characters are woefully underwhelming. I want to care about these new folks but you just didn't write a story I care about. No depth. Waiting this many years for that episode was such a let down which brings me to the acting. Oh my God, I get it. They criticized the original for not having gay actresses. I'd rather see an excellent Straight actress play gay than a mediocre gay actress play anything. I get it the crew allows you to make your check boxes but it was unnecessary. Finally let's face it. While I hate to say it, there was a lot of eye candy on the first show making it appealing to almost everyone gay or straight. I'm guessing this season is a wrap hopefully it will improve. PS, ok, second show a little better...................... hung in there and I believe it's less of bad acting because I see they all have potential but aren't given much to work with in the writing. These are definitely not the best writers and are definitely not the same writers from seasons 1-6. It feels like a narrated movie without debt and character development. Forced. I really want to care about Dani and Sophie's relationship. It's hard. Bette storyline is so far the best and I do love her relationship with Angie. I'll admit I expect her to ""win win win"" so this is different for her. The directing is only slightly better than the writing at this stage. Stop with the cliff notes or L word for dummies series. My thoughts in a nutshell. Tongue in cheek. Show me, don't just tell me so I can feel and care more. And yes, I'm not of the 140 character generation.",/review/rw5350944/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2020,kzimmerman13,5," Disappointing
","I was a fan of the original show. This new show was disappointing, to say the least. It just doesn't work. Too much emphasis on the implausible running for mayor thing, some of the acting was terrible, and Finley is just annoying. And they are all rich, except for Finley. It just ring true to any of my life experience. And Bette was never one of my favorite characters, anyway.",/review/rw5350944/?ref_=tt_urv

26 February 2022,BreeIreland,1," Depressing to watch
","This show literally portrays lesbians as immoral, lust driven, shallow human beings who can't control their desires and cheat all the time. None of them have a happy, functioning relationship. The story lines and dialogues are shallow. Does not feel like an episode but more like several TikTok stories put together. The woke agenda is also exhausting.",/review/rw5350944/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2020,allhailkingdanielicometoserve,3," Unconvincing
","An unconvincing new cast (I blame the script not the actors) in a spinoff so far from the heart of the original it could just as easily be a ""Melrose Place"" for the 21st century. The edginess is completely lost.",/review/rw5350944/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2019,bangel3322,6," It's not that bad!!!
","I'm seeing a lot of hate towards this, because of course, people are comparing it to the original show. Now, as an original fan, I would have much preferred if all the old cast had come back. I love the old cast, even crazy Jenny. However for whatever reason they haven't brought back the original cast and they've got a new cast...and I don't mind them at all. I think the girl who plays Dani is a great actress. I really like her character. I like the new blonde girl. (Forgot her name). I am not however keen on Dani's fiancée or their male roommate. But it's minor. It's still good and I'm loving the return of Bette, Alice and Shane. I'm glad they're the main characters and not background characters as there were some rumours they weren't going to be prominently featured. So 3 episodes in, I'm giving it a solid 6. I'm sure it will get better. It's worth a watch.",/review/rw5350944/?ref_=tt_urv

","I just finished season 2 episode 1. It was SO BORING I want to go and get drunk and die in the road. I usually see where the idea is and where it could go but this was so stupid and slow I don't know why it was even written down, let alone supposedly story boarded, scheduled and shot. How about all the characters die in an explosion except like 4 of them and it's a post apocalyptic world... oh wait that would be too interesting. There is no chemistry, no reason, no substance. It is like they wrote down a list of all The L Word original was about, deleted all the interesting things, then left a line ""lesbians"" and then wrote ""the stuff you regret spending your time with"" like it was meant to be a big joke but some idiot in the room thought it was a great plan. PULL THIS SHOW OFF THE AIR and put anything else in its place. Give me the money and I'll give you interesting characters and storylines!",/review/rw5350944/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2020,melissamariekrall,6," Watchable but mediocre.
","I watched the original series and I did enjoy it, but I always felt it was a little bit overrated. I do feel Gen Q is generally more surface level than the original. The plots are predictable and the show in general is a little underwhelming. I hate to say this, but I find the actress that plays Finley to be borderline unwatchable. Her acting has the subtlety of a hammer. That being said, I think most the acting in the series is heavy handed, so fault could lie with the director.",/review/rw5350944/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was so eager to keep up with Kit, Helena, Tina, Tasha, etc... and they seemed to vanish in fresh air.
I am not able to follow the plot, nor I feel connected to the new characters.
I forced myself to watch episode two to see if there was a little more connection. Nope! I didn't happen

6 August 2021,moov_e_c_er,7," What the heck?
","I watched season 1 and it was odd compared to original. New characters and new direction. But I watched it a few times to see past my own expectations as I was excited before first watch, a little disappointed at first viewing, and then second time around was better but could have been better at times. Now started season 2 and it's so boring I keep shutting my eyes and trying not to roll my eyeballs back in boredom. Is this show bad because it's produced by actors? They should know what works with all the work they've done and it's easy to see what succeeded and got positive following and what should never be done again. I'm watching the concept of the show but I could do a hell of a lot better and improve every single episode and concept. They need to hire a producer who brings in the flash, the bang, the story and character arch, the meat to the table. This entire show so far is side dish, not artsy and not interesting but it SHOULD be. NOTE TO CAST AND CREW: Wake the hell up and make this show interesting and stop feeding us slow crap.",/review/rw5350944/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2019,catsy29,7," What the F word with this backlash? The L Word is back and it's not bad at all!
","The L Word changed my life. I was a very confused 14 year Colombian girl living in a very small city with my very Catholic family. I was not old enough to watch the show but fk it, I finally understood why I felt out of place and I didn't ""get it"" when my friends talked about some ""boy being super hot"". I realized that I was, and I am, lesbian. I know the show ended up being crap.

12 October 2021,moov_e_c_er,7," When a show is written from actors
","When you are a writer and focus on your work the world written is clearer. When it is produced/idea by actors they are not writers so you get more ""I want to act that out"" vibe instead of a good story. I was super mad first episode of second season and wrote review because I watched first season before starting second and it didn't link up well. Now I'm at end season 2 and it makes more sense but every episode is still vibe ""I want to act that out"" instead of good story and characters going on an arch driven ride.",/review/rw5350944/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2020,teacothran-77612,9," Initially haters were the only reviews!
","I signed up for Showtime just to watch this new season. After the first 2 episodes I looked at reviews and it was very low. 2/10. It seemed as if people that believed it was going to be the same as the first series were highly disappointed and writing about it. They just didn't realize that times have changed. Its widely accepted and now protected. I thought they did a great job. I cancelled Showtime until next season comes out. Of course the characters have changed a lot. More than 10 years have gone by. But this series has stories to tell. Since the rating have now gone up. 7/10. I hope we get more episodes next season, and that this series runs for at least as many seasons as the first time around. Thanks Jennifer Beals for your continued representation. You are a true ally to LGBTQ COMMUNITY. I was completely blown away with Laurel Holloway's cameo appearance. It was so unexpected. Because I truly believed she would not be in this series at all. When I heard Pam Grier wouldn't be back, I did suspect that she had died in some form. So, I did see that coming. But looking forward to who else does make cameos in the future.",/review/rw5350944/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2019,Heathonistt,5," Much promise, even more problems
","First off, I was very surprised by the warm and fuzzy feelings I got watching Shane, Bette, and Alice come back to life. I didn't realize I had such L word nostalgia. They were 3 of my favorite characters from the past series. I was also excited to see the series was either filmed more in LA or shot to include more LA. The show feels similar to the past, but there are some major issues I can't ignore. Most are related to the cast, who I am JUST NOW learning are NOT all women over 35 - they picked some very mature looking 20-somethings, and I really question what they were thinking when they cast the newbies. First, Finley. UHG. The WORST. She cannot act. She dresses like a slob, to the extent I'm grossed out watching her. Her characters personality is obnoxious and reminds me of all the self-important mooches I refused to date in art school. Constantly drunk, needing a shower, wearing dirty poor-fitting clothes, expecting everyone else to pay her way through the world. Her mouth is always hanging open - I'm waiting to see drool dribble out, Plus the hairy pits - ugh, no. I don't care how anti-feminist that makes me seem, it's repulsive. If the actress doesn't shave, fine, but do you need to include multiple full pit-bush shots in the first and only sex scene she was in that didn't involve vomit? I only hated one L word character more than Finley, and that was Tina. I never met anyone who liked Tina. Even to this day, I yell ""Shut up, Tina!"" whenever I see the actress in other work. Dani is OK, but she really is just a poor copy of a mini-Bette. I also don't care to continue exploring the trauma of having a conservative latin family not accept her, as I've watched that crap hurt many people I love. I feel a better message for the new generation is to just accept that a lot of us have trash parents and getting them to accept our sexuality is not something that should fill our lives with stress and drama. I'm 35 and frankly, neither of my parents have ever known anything about my sex life other than grabbing dinner with a couple of people I was/am in long term relationships with, and I LOVE it. Never been happier. Micah is OK, too nervous and timid, but I have learned nothing about him aside from his crush on the neighbor he knows nothing about. Alice's girlfriend is SO boring. I know the actress is married to Tig Nataro, but watching her in One Mississippi was tedious and she bored the crap out of me there too. She comes off as too fake-nice to be real, like women I've known who fake meekness and femininity because that's the only way they feel lovable. I don't ever see a person like Alice dating someone so simple and vanilla. What do they even have in common? Sophie seems to only exist to add a little latina spice into scenes (almost in a cringeworthy token way, but as this character has spoken 5 lines in 3 episodes, I'll try not to judge), I know nothing about her aside from that she always is acting like she's a bit drunk or high or ready to party. She gets this look in her eyes - I used to bartend and when people would get that vacant, weak-necked look, I cut them off. The lesbian bartenders - didn't we already watch this? Dawn Denbo and her lover Cindy, right? Except Dawn and Cindy were much more colorful, exciting, and interesting characters (they weren't any of those things, but they were more than these new bartenders fighting over Shane). These two could be replaced by new actresses next week and I'd never notice. I can't really think of too many other new characters that stood out. The main missing ingredients in this series compared to the original are SEXINESS and HUMOR. The sex scenes in this reboot are all very awkward, uncomfortable, a bit gross (spoiler alert-the series opens with menstruation blood oral sex, which told me right away that I wasn't going to be able to convince anyone I knew to watch this show with me). I don't feel any chemistry between any of the couples. And the lack of humor is unfortunate. Alice is ""the funny one"" yet the funniest thing she did in the first 3 episodes was take several minutes to decide to grab a crock pot for her girlfriends kid to throw up in (yet another very gross moment). I feel like the show is a bit torn in two directions - one where they seem to be trying to appeal to the new, more fluid and colorful generation, and one where they're continuing the drama of the past. I think the show CAN work incorporating both, but we need more of a bridge between the groups. I think one or two more OG L Word cast members (or a few) need to guest star from time to time (HELENA, please, she went from the character I hated most to one of my favs in the original series, it was awesome watching her fall, and get back up, and grow. Also maybe KIT. I would have loved to see more Dana or Jenny, but they killed those two off :( What about CARMEN? Or JODI??). Also we need something to bring the generations together besides that they work for Alice. And more FUN! There are NO lesbian bars in all of Los Angeles?! REALLY??? Don't make your audience sit there and watch people in suits argue politics in office buildings for hours. That stuff really dragged on too much in the original series. Make Bette Mayor, make it fun, inspire your audience, helps them believe anything is possible. That's what we watch TV for.",/review/rw5350944/?ref_=tt_urv
