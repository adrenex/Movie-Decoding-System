27 August 2019,UniqueParticle,10," Perfect since I have ASD I know what its like to be different!
","Beyond heartwarming and funny; I absolutely loved everything about this movie! I'm thrilled that Shia Labouf is acting again, he was off the radar for awhile. Dakota Johnson is precious and Zack Gottsagen - I have only one complaint is the word retard even for someone like me with autism hurts my feelings. I smiled so much during the entire film, highly recommend to anyone!!",/review/rw5093590/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2021,Doublej20005,8," A Really Enjoyable Comedy
","A really charming adventure with well developed characters, good performances and a very strong emotional centre. All of the performances are really good, particularly from Zack Gottsagen and Shia LaBeouf, and their characters have enjoyable relationships that leads to a lot of natural humour coming from them. It's nice to see down syndrome representation in films without that big of a deal being made about it. I really like the visual feel of the film - the landscapes are great to look at and the colour palette matches the feel of the film perfectly. Most of my issues are smaller, such as some bad editing, but overall this is a fun and charming film that I would definitely recommend.",/review/rw5093590/?ref_=tt_urv

","...or get in your way if you want it hard enough; no matter who or what you are - just go for it, you'll achieve nothing if you don't. Inspirational and heartfelt stuff to be found here in spades, and while those words get overused on far too many occasions they are more than appropriate in describing the courageous and endearing Zak Gottsagen who brings a spark of magic to proceedings. A true role model to all and one to be looked up to and admired in his own right.",/review/rw5093590/?ref_=tt_urv

14 November 2019,truemythmedia,10," Simply Delightful
","The Peanut Butter Falcon is this year's feel good movie, and it might as well be this decades for all that matters. It's a perfect look at how we as a society treat people with mental disabilities, and how that needs to change, how even the most rugged battle hardened people like Tyler have the most common sense of the situation in front of him, he shows us that compassion can go a long way. And while he still has to pay for his sins, he's fully aware and ready for the confrontation. The talent here are all at the top of their games, especially newcomer Zack who is an absolute delight to watch, full of humor and emotion of which LaBeouf and Johnson meet on equal caliber. This film is perfect for family viewing at anytime, for anyone anywhere, don't miss this one.",/review/rw5093590/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2019,deloudelouvain,9," Heartwarming little gem.
","After briefly reading a synopsis I didn't really know what to expect from The Peanut Butter Falcon. I was wondering if this would be a movie that I could enjoy but I'm glad I gave it a shot as it's certainly one of the better movies I watched this year, and I watch a lot of movies. It's a simple but effective story, showing us that people with down syndrome can have dreams and a fullfilling life. The chemistry and complicity between Zack Gottsagen and Shia LaBeouf looks sincere and is what makes this movie an enjoyable and emotion rich movie. I laughed a lot whilst you would think there is not much to laugh about with a serious subject like down syndrome. Zack Gottsagen did an excellent job playing his character, he made my day. Good cinematography, an excellent cast, an easy but amusing story to follow. I will definitely recommend this movie to others and I'm sure I will watch it again in the future.",/review/rw5093590/?ref_=tt_urv

24 August 2019,nomercy1999,10," Amazing
","As the father of a son with Down Syndrome I had high hopes and expectations for this movie. I watched all the interviews and reviews and was super excited to watch this. My wife and I went to watch it this morning, first showing and first people to purchase tickets from our local movie theatre. The movie starts and we were in awe of Zak and Tyler. They're chemistry was electric. You could tell Shia truly loved being beside and being with Gotteagen. This movie made my heart happy more than anything.
I understand the movie had to tackle the dreaded ""R"" word and it hurt hearing the word tossed out by a child at the beginning but Zaks response was legendary and I will never forget it!
It did a great job of shedding light on people with Down Syndrome and the struggles SOME go through. Unfortunately there are still people out there who don't know the joy of having a person with Down Syndrome can truly bring into they're lives.
All in all an amazing movie that makes perfect sense. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who has any heart.
Hopefully this will become a series cause I would personally love to follow this story for as long as it can go on.",/review/rw5093590/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8," It's his birthday party and we're all invited.
","'The Peanut Butter Falcon (2019)' is a feel-good road movie about a young man with Down syndrome who escapes from his care-home to pursue a career as a wrestler, meeting and bonding with a guilt-ridden man on the run in the process. It's a kind-hearted, uplifting experience with a positive, anti-discrimination message and a palpable, life-affirming central relationship. The piece is sweet but never saccharine, a perfect mix of mundane realism and smile-inducing absurdity. Its world feels tangible throughout, as do all its characters, and its narrative somehow manages to milk its familiar premise for all it's worth. Even though it is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be, you can't help but go along for the ride. At the same time, it subtly subverts some of the genre's most obvious tropes. It's a great time that doesn't talk down to its audience. It's genuinely charming and it's also rather funny. It's great. 8/10",/review/rw5093590/?ref_=tt_urv

","Endearing movie. You can tell this was made far away from corrupt Hollywood. Somebody in the movie industry finally came up with a good storyline, and made a Quality movie. Maybe a couple of cuss words, but a movie that doesn't have all the evilness like most movies that Hollywood and Netflix spit out on a weekly basis. The title is not to Whippie, but if you give this movie at least 10 minutes of your time, you'll probably most likely want to watch the rest of it. Tune in and enjoy!",/review/rw5093590/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2019,roger-99-171599,8," A soul cleansing experience!
","While running away together, but for different reasons and directions, two abandoned young men are invited by a blind preacher to hear the Gospel and take a deep dive into the river. Processing an unlikely friendship, of mutual support and reliance, as well as interests and goals to find freedom, they are called to reconnect with the Creator in order to shape and strengthen themselves. The hot-headed, rebellious fisherman Tyler (Shia Labeouf) refuses the improvised baptism, convincing his runaway-partner Zak (Zack Gottsagen), a young man with Down Syndrome, to go into the river, despite his inability to swim or even to understand the ritual. After the spiritual encounter, those inspirational words continue to fill their hearts with hope, as they surrender entirely to the Almighty. It is deeply represented as they leave the preacher's territory, while reflecting on themselves; while in movement, on the road, the rays of sun shine upon them, as they touch each other's face, as a response with such grace and joy for being made accordingly to His own image. This moving spiritual experience (one that will definitely bring tears) gives them motivation to pursuit their goals: Tyler must avoid a pair of thugs (including Oscar nominee John Hawkes) with whom he had a crab-merchandise dispute, as he leaves the state in search of opportunities; Zak had always dreamt of becoming a wrestler, and plans to get trained at a school managed by an iconic wrestler (Thomas Haden Church). Their lives are suddenly connected, as they find familiar comfort to relief their disappointment and abandonment: Tyler is haunted by the tragic death of his brother, and Zak was left alone at the clinic-home, rejected by his family. Conceived by writers-directors Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz, in their outstanding feature debut collaboration, this heartbreaking, humorous, crowd-pleasing fugitive story is certainly one of the most accomplished indie films of the year. The ""Thelma & Louise"" structure works efficiently, as a road movie on the highways, on the river, or by foot, the pair is running from their realities and dangers in order to find themselves. The music, editing and stupendous cinematography, capture the hopelessness and despair of its characters (including a fine performance by Dakota Johnson as the social worker responsible to rescue Zak), and the idyllic, mysterious, remote and serene landscapes of the wilderness, creating an absorbing, poetical and insightful atmosphere.",/review/rw5093590/?ref_=tt_urv

They captured the charm of the south, while showing the even more unique charm of parts of Dare County, NC.

","Early in the picture, an elderly citizen of the retirement home (Bruce Dern), says to the story's principal character - ""Friends are the family you choose"". The rest of the picture demonstrates how that all plays out, as Zak (Zack Gottsagen), a young man with Down Syndrome, becomes a runaway to pursue his dream of becoming a professional wrestler. It appears that the story takes place in the present day, but if so, the owner of Bubba's trading post/gas stop is sorely behind the times with regular unleaded priced at a dollar nineteen, and premium at a dollar seventy five.

31 December 2019,Cineanalyst,6," Living the American Dream, Like a Mark Twain Story
","Shia LaBeouf's character, Tyler, sums up ""The Peanut Butter Falcon"" conspicuously, at one point, with the above quotation. As every reviewer with even a passing familiarity with that particular ""great American novel,"" Twain's ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"" has mentioned, this movie is similar to that river-rafting journey of Americana with the local color of its Southern settings and vernacular of its people. Instead of floating down the Mississippi River through the antebellum South, however, ""The Peanut Butter Falcon"" takes place in the present along the Outer Banks of North Carolina. There's the bromance between two fugitives: one, Zak, a young man with Down syndrome escaping his forced residency at a nursing home and the other, Tyler, a dirt-poor fisherman on the run after stealing crabs and committing arson. The ultimate destination of their adventure is a professional wrestling camp run by ""Salt Water Redneck."" Along the way. Zak comes up with his own alter ego for the ring, the titular ""Peanut Butter Falcon.""",/review/rw5093590/?ref_=tt_urv

","Took me all of 30 seconds to get hooked on the story. The actors were perfect. Shia might be weird in real life but he knows when to put his actor's face on.

1 September 2019,ThomasDrufke,9," Rule #1 = Party
","I've been watching some pretty heavy movies and TV of late, so it was nice to enjoy a light hearted and sweet film like The Peanut Butter Falcon. The story behind how this movie got made is probably worthy of its own film, see Mike Schwartz & Tyler Nilson's interviews over the last few weeks to truly appreciate the miraculous journey the film went on before it got to the big screens. Luckily, the film itself is good on its own merits, as we follow Zak (played by Zack Gottsagen), a 22 year old man hoping to fulfill his childhood dream of meeting his hero, Salt Water Redneck, and becoming a professional wrestler after escaping from his caregiver, played by Dakota Johnson. From there, he meets and travels with Shia LaBeouf, who's on his own journey of re-self discovery. From there, we have a modern day retelling of Huckleberry Finn, with its own sort of wrestling twist. And by the time you get to the final 10 minutes, they've completely earned the ending they present. It absolutely is one of the sweetest films of the last 5 years.",/review/rw5093590/?ref_=tt_urv
