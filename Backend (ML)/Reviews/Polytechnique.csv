17 December 2021,valleyjohn,8," A really good film that's not all that it seems.
","Riz Ahmed is one of those actors who rarely makes a bad movie . At the moment he is on a hot streak of really good films and Encounter is no different although I'd argue that Riz probably isn't the star of this film , it's the two actors who play his sons .",/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2022,deloudelouvain,8," Keeps you guessing for awhile, cleverly done.
","Nothing surprises me anymore. Another good movie that a lot of people hate. If this one isn't entertaining enough for some people I wonder what they find entertaining? Encounter keeps you guessing for a long time, what I found very cleverly done. Maybe the haters are not pleased with the outcome, because they were expecting something else, but it doesn't really matter. If you like a slightly mysterious story, with some good acting you can't really go wrong with Encounter. Riz Ahmed, playing the main character, was very convincing in his role, and the two kids also looked very natural in their roles. It's not easy to find good child actors but these two did a good job. I thought the story was pleasant to follow so I really don't get why this movie gets so many negative reviews. I wouldn't pay too much attention to the low scores and give it a shot, you might like it like a lot of other people did.",/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv

","Army brat here. Military kids are only allowed to cry on two occasions - the day Daddy leaves to go to war and the day the two soldiers show up to tell you he isn't coming home. If Daddy comes home crazy (or Mom goes crazy while he's gone), the kids take the beatings for it. But they don't cry.",/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2021,tsroque,9," NOT a Sci-Fi! It's a DRAMA!!!
","If you're watching this film thinking it's about aliens, you're in the wrong place! It's about a father struggling with mental health issues who kidnaps his sons thinking he's saving them from an alien invasion. Riz Ahmed's performance was OUTSTANDING!!! Those who rated this film low were rating the miscategorization of this movie. I was surprised too but I ended up loving this movie!",/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv

12 December 2021,avery_yates,7," Not a bad psychological thriller. NOT Science fiction.

19 December 2021,frankblack-79961,3," Click bait for sci-fi fans. Amazon stoops low on this one.
","This was a huge disappointment for me. If you are relying on the Amazon synopsis for the film, you will be too. I should have looked at the reviews, but I didn't. Wasted an hour before i realized this wasnt a sci-fi.",/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2021,jaimemedina-36288,3," A waste of a good premise
","There's no sci fi in this movie which would make it more of a psychological thriller if there was any real tension or suspense at all in this total miss of a production. But there isn't. Instead what we have is a completely formulaic absurdity. All the clich√©s appear: the paranoia, is it real or imagined, the annoying kid that keeps getting the group in trouble, the one dimensional point A to point B plot progression, etc etc. It's a shame because the implied premise is quite good. But It's just bait and switch. You never really believe that anyone is really going to be hurt so there is zero suspense. And there's no courage in the story to go anywhere that we haven't seen 100 times before. And there's absolutely no 3 act so there's no intelligence to the story in the end. There's no processing of tension because there's nothing there to process. As the credits role you're left with ""meh"". Which is a crime given the talent in the cast.",/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2021,ztigr,6," Another bait and switch...why?
","I never understand movies that tease one premise but deliver another. Didnt Amazon just do this with the Owen Wilson film? Is wrapping mental illness in a trojan horse costume supposed to enlighten us somehow? You order a cheeseburger and get an orange. Well maybe you should just target orange lovers instead rather tricking the cheeseburger customers. Its not clever, its not enlightening and its not engaging.",/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2021,and_shove_it_up_your_butt,4," Left me frustrated
","A ton of sizzle but no steak. The ending left me feeling disappointed and let down. I did enjoy the performances of the three main characters (Riz, Lucian-River and Aditya) however, as compelling as they were they couldn't save this movie.",/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2021,atractiveeyes,7," Pleasant Surprise
","I actually saw it because of its interesting cast and had low expectations because it seemed just like not my cup of tea but it turned out to be a fun ride. The story is interesting, it flows beautifully and unexpectedly, and tackles a beautiful topic. It has some nicely shot thrilling action scenes, it also gets emotional sometimes. All in all, it's very good and highly enjoyable but don't see it if you're looking for a typical sci-fi movie.",/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2021,kgrv2000,7," Pleasant surprise
","Along with a lot of other people, I too went into this thinking it's a sci-fi film. I have to fault Amazon for false marketing. Even the beautiful opening scenes presented that. Anyways, I couldn't get angry because the whole film was superbly made. The acting by Riz and the older boy was so good. It kept me guessing right up near the end. I kept expecting there really are alien parasites.",/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2021,frank-liesenborgs,7," No Sci-fi but the harsh reality of PTSD
","""Encounter"" tells the story of a former marine, Malik Khan (Ahmed) who is watching for signs of an alien invasion. One he thinks that is quietly overtaking the country following a meteor shower that brought a parasitic creature. The biggest mistake of the movie is the trailer. After seeing the trailer, you will expect aliens and a real Sci-fi movie. Nope. This movie deals with the harsh reality of soldiers coming back from a war and suffering mental problems. I have nothing but respect for these soldiers and this movie shows this aspect. Outstanding acting from Riz Ahmed (Malik Khan) and his two sons in the movie, Lucian-River Chauhan (Jay) and Aditya Geddada (Bobby). You will hear from these boys in the future. This is an excellent movie, well shot and nice scenery. Forget the trailer and enjoy this movie.",/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2021,Asper12,10," Emotional journey
","It was a great movie. Fantastic performance from Riz Ahmed as expected but the father-son bond was beautifully captured by the kids, especially the older one.",/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2021,grakky,3," Wrong genre
","This is definitely not a sci fi if as the genre mentions, just another movie about a guy with possible PTSD.",/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2021,Maelific71,3," This Really Bugs Me
","Is Riz Ahmed talented? Absolutely. If you haven't watched ""The Night Of"" you have to be living under a rock. Is PTSD a serious subject? Of course. So if the two are joined together, does that make it a good movie?",/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2021,Beachbum2018,3," Disturbing and a bit depressing
","Not as advertised, it's certainly not sci-fi, more psychological.",/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2021,willandcharlenebrown,4," Would be an 8 rating if not for the bait and switch
",What a Debbie downer. I need to be mentally prepared for PTSD movies. Don't bring me in for senseless cool sci-fi then drag me into mental depression and kids witnessing a fathers breakdown.,/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2021,nufc_geordie,4," Not Sci-Fi!
","This is not science fiction, nor a thriller. This is a movie about PTSD and family. However, the cast and acting are excellent and make it watchable. The few action scenes are adequately done but completely unnecessary.",/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2021,ferguson-6,6," this one bugged me
","Greetings again from the darkness. It's all in the terminology you opt to use. Secret rescue mission or kidnapping. Protective or paranoid. Alien invasion or mental illness. By opening on a meteor flashing across the night, and following that with National Geographic-style shots of bugs in nature, parasites attacking hosts, and news clips of violent rioters, we can't help but assume that writer-director Michael Pearce (BEAST, 2017) and co-writer Joe Barton want us to believe the end is near.",/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2021,creator301,7," What movie did yall watch?
",This is a fantastic commentary on american soldiers being abandoned and thrown in the garbage by their country. Then the scars of battle disgust society so much we feel theyre now too violent and we need to imprison them. Watch this movie again punks. Amazing.,/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2021,whsergent,3," Not a sci fi movie or a thriller
","Its mediocre melodrama redeemed only by Mr. Ahmeds stellar performance. He pretty much single handedly pulled this run of the mill, lifetime movie quality hunk of schmaltz out of the fire and even then its just watchable.",/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2021,skip-98756,7," An Alien Movie with No Aliens...OK
","Well anyone expecting an Invasion movie
is gonna be sorely dissapointed.. Good acting from highly rated actors in a movie whose title And description is totally misleading...Looks more like a drama about a veteran who has PTSD.",/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2021,zhivago97,10," Wonderful surprise

12 December 2021,paul_haakonsen,3," All PTSD and no aliens...
","When I sat down to watch the 2021 movie ""Encounter"" from writers Joe Barton and Michael Pearce, I must admit that I figured that I would be in for a movie with aliens in it. Especially since it is what the movie's synopsis heavily hinted at.",/review/rw7639080/?ref_=tt_urv
