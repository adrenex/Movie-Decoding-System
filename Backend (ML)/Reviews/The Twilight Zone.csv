10 January 2022,classicsoncall,8," ""Don't look for your father to save you. And don't play sports.""
","I really enjoyed this movie. Can't really say why, it just has that nifty, down home atmosphere that comes with lower and middle class values that eventually show up in the the progression of youth to adulthood. It's also a nostalgic look back in time to the Seventies and Eighties with a complementary sidetrack invoking songs from the era that fit the tenor of the story. A big surprise here is Ben Affleck portraying bar owner and all around wise man as Uncle Charlie to young JR (Daniel Ranieri), and later, the college bound youth (Tye Sheridan) that JR grows into. Uncle Charlie is the kind of presence you can relate to without being overbearing or annoying. And for a working stiff, he's a generous guy, handing young JR an autographed Tom Seaver baseball, and after he graduates, his very own first car to take him out on life's highway. Side stories of JR's unrequited first love come into play without being mawkish, and the harrowed relationship with his own father (Max Martini) is finally resolved with a cutting of the cord that proves his own maturity and independence.",/review/rw7740343/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2022,Instant_Palmer,8," An Ensemble Gem - Affleck Deserves Recognition

21 December 2021,ferguson-6,6," excellent first half
","Greetings again from the darkness. Pulitzer Prize winning novelist and journalist JR Moehringer published his memoir in 2005. Fortunately for him, it led to his being in high demand to pen the memoirs of others. Unfortunately for us, it also led to George Clooney directing a mostly listless movie version. Adapted by Oscar-winning screenwriter William Monahan (THE DEPARTED, 2006), the film does offer a surprisingly interesting performance from Ben Affleck, while also failing to capitalize on other elements that could have provided a boost.",/review/rw7740343/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's 1973. JR (Daniel Ranieri) and his mother (Lily Rabe) have to move back in with her father (Christopher Lloyd). It's a house full of extended family including Uncle Charlie (Ben Affleck). JR doesn't know his long-absent irresponsible father and Uncle Charlie who owns a local bar becomes his father figure.

17 April 2022,latinfineart,8," An excellent film. So well written
","If you like those sloppy, bulbous, bloated, fake, illiterate Marvel movies you probably won't be able to relate to this film, but if you like films that are written by adults, films that are written with a sense of lyricism and poetry, films that are about the celebration of life and characters and neighborhoods and people, then you'll probably enjoy this film.",/review/rw7740343/?ref_=tt_urv

","As ""The Tender Bar"" (2021 release; 104 min.) opens, a young boy (named J. R.) and his mom are moving back into her parents' house on Long Island in 1973. Also living is the house is Uncle Charlie, the brother of The Absent Father who is a DJ on a New York Top-40s station. Uncle Charlie runs a bar, the Dickens, where everybody knows your name...

","The movie was good. Very touching and heartwarming, with a great sense of time and place. A little uneven at times. But Affleck gives what I think is his best, most real performance. Not his usual movie star stuff. He should be nominated for an Oscar for this.",/review/rw7740343/?ref_=tt_urv

Really entertaining and beautiful movie, full of small moments that manage to make you fond of the protagonist and keep you glued to the screen.

8 January 2022,Holt344,8," The Tender Bar is a slow paced coming of age drama that leaves you emotionally invested
","The Tender Bar is a coming-of-age drama directed by George Clooney from a screenplay by William Monahan. It's adapted from the memoir of the same name by J. R. Moehringer, and recounts Moehringer's life growing up on Long Island. Tye Sheridan stars as J. R. Moehringer and Ben Affleck stars as Charlie Moehringer.

17 January 2022,madanmarwah,7," Ben Affleck shines as he plays bartender mentor to his nephew
","There is Uncle Charlie, bartender ( Ben Affleck) in a bar named ""The Dickens"" inspired by Charles Dickens and instead of liquor bottles in the cabinet he has a collection of books. Something more unusual is that he doles out serious advice to young 10 year old boy JR ( Daniel Ranieri) on how an ideal man should behave. This movie is based on the memoirs of famous journalist JR Moehringer, and chronicles his growth from a boy to a young man studying at Yale and later aspiring to be a writer.",/review/rw7740343/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2022,atractiveeyes,5," Average
",It's an average coming of age film. It has some good elements but it feels empty. The cast is interesting with very good performances. Cinematography is nice. It also tackles a beautiful topic but the screenplay is a mess. Dialogues are weak and the story flows chaotically. Editing is bad too.,/review/rw7740343/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2022,fmilder-533-34251,4," Disappointing
","The Tender Bar is a series of disconnected vignettes, first involving young JR, and then college-and-a-few-years-after JR. There's little continuity and an unexpected (and odd) jump between the two ages. In so many ways, this plays like the real JR wanting to tell you ten scenes from his life, with little regard for whether this would make an interesting, or even watchable, movie. It left me wondering who paired the book down to the movie.",/review/rw7740343/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2022,gortx,," Clooney's adaptation of JR Moehringer's memoir
","This year's entry in the poor kid who makes it as a writer awards bait entry. Like last year's HILLBILLY ELEGY, George Clooney's movie laddles on the woes and miseries while always trying to assure the audience that it will be all right in the end -- it's a memoir, after all (J. R. Moehringer).",/review/rw7740343/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2022,danieljfarthing,10," Excellent rites of passage fare
","In 80's based autobiographical drama ""The Tender Bar"" young Daniel Ranieri (then Tye Sheridan as the older version) is raised by his blue-collar family including loveable single mum Lily Rabe, farting grandpa Christopher Lloyd, & most notably bar managing cool uncle Ben Affleck. Via the likes of Affleck & the bar gang's support & wisdom, deadbeat dad Max Martini's failings, the bitter-sweetness of first love (Briana Middleton) & the forging of friendship (Rhenzy Feliz) boy becomes man (and a writer). Excellently performed (esp Affleck), solidly directed (George Clooney) & superbly written (William Monahan) it is top quality rites-of-passage fare. Excellent.",/review/rw7740343/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2022,mick-meyers,8," Enjoyable coming of age film
","An enjoyable nostalgic trip to the seventies.abley directed by George Clooney.the young boy at the beginning is very good,as the actor playing the older self Ben Affleck equips himself above the usual standard.the men in the film do come across as a sorry bunch,with women being shown as the stronger sex fatherhood comes in for a bit of a battering but there are some good guys out there.not a bad movie.",/review/rw7740343/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2022,guskeller,7," Fine but hardly a must-see
","The Tender Bar is an acceptable attempt at a solid subgenre. The coming-of-age story has merit but is overdone, making it difficult for new installments to stand out. So, even though The Tender Bar means well, it is missing a selling point to make it memorable. Ben Affleck excels in his supporting role and the soundtrack is strong, but that isn't enough to produce a hit. Primarily, this is because the story is stale. It explores ideas of manhood, self-efficacy, and success, yet not in particularly special ways. Despite some decent quotes, most of The Tender Bar is eclipsed by previous films in its class.",/review/rw7740343/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,sdiegotw,3," So very boring...
","I'm almost halfway into this movie and I'm giving up. The first half (at least) is dominated by the wooden-headed Ben Affleck delivering one of his usual powerhouse performances. I don't care at all about any of the characters or what is happening to them. The producers chose to use a very heavy, stifling warm filter on this film. I've never seen so much yellow injected into a movie's coloring. The events in this movie took place about 40 years ago. We get it. But the world wasn't more yellow back then. There's no reason for the heavy yellowing or the low contrast. The wardrobe and the vehicles are done well, and they'd be more than enough to remind us when this story takes place. Ultimately, none of that matters, though, because the movie is just plain boring.",/review/rw7740343/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2022,frank-liesenborgs,8," Ben is back!!
","""The Tender Bar"" is set in the 1970s and tells the narrative of J. R. Moehringer, a young kid whose father abandons him before he has a chance to know him. J. R.'s mother relocates the couple to her father's property in Manhasset, Long Island, where J. R. (Tye Sheridan / Daniel Ranieri) spends his time at his Uncle Charlie's (Ben Affleck) pub, The Dickens. He learns lessons about life, love, and how to be far better than his father at the bar. It feels a bit strange to get lessons in life from people who belong in AA meetings. Although Tye Sheridan is pretty good here, Ben Affleck's performance is the only one sticking out. Without him, ""The Tender Bar"" would not be the movie you are looking for. I'd go as far as to say that this is an almost impeccable movie. This next phase of Ben Affleck's career is scary good. If he keeps acting like this he will have no problem in shaking off ""The Batman"" attachment. He is aging like a fine wine as an actor and is back on the very high level he was over 20 years ago. And remember this name: Daniel Ranieri. The young actor playing the young JR who shows considerable screen presence in his acting debut. He´ll be back. This kid is acting like an Oscar winner. Remember his name! Soundtrack was amazing and starting to Love George Clooney as a director. This movie is definitely worth watching. The only negative point for me was that the movie was way too short.",/review/rw7740343/?ref_=tt_urv
