18 December 2022,MrDeWinters,5," aka In from Behind
","What a mess. Although it is nice to see gay men portrayed as being non-camp for a change, portraying them as ultra straight-acting is also not realistic. The main issue of this movie is not only the length of the movie (30 min too long) but the script. The dialogue is no different from any day time soap and the drama has a telenovela feel to it. The characters are far too old to engage in this type of teenage drama. A lot of repetitive scenes could have been cut out easily. Apart from one character all characters including the main ones are not very likeable. You don't really care about any of them which show a lack of character development. A lot has not been explained and you're left with wondering what the message was. Also, the music is over the top reminding of something you would hear in a war or historical battle movie. For a movie that rides on sexual attraction and the resulting drama, the sex scenes look staged, awkward and sanitised. Sometimes a tighter editing can help but the shortcomings of this movie are too many, unfortunately.",/review/rw8553568/?ref_=tt_urv

","A romance among gay rugby players seemed like a promising concept, but In From the Side fumbles the play at every turn. As star-crossed lovers go, Mark and Warren make for a rather lacklustre couple. Both are cheating on their long-term partners, and their reluctance to leave their established relationships and choose each other remains frustratingly vague. As affairs go, theirs is frustratingly unremarkable. There's really nothing to lift it above the mundane or add some real dramatic tension. As Mark, Alexander Lincoln is a moderately appealing leading man - sexy and suitably vulnerable and conflicted. Alexander King as Warren is less appealing. He's neither charming nor charismatic enough to compensate for Warren being, to put it mildly, a complete ass. We never really get why Mark is so besotted with him, and by the time Warren fails to stand up for Mark when their affair is exposed at a New Year's Eve Party there's really no redeeming him. When Warren subsequently shows up at a rugby match with his boyfriend - and makes a very public display of affection - it's a mystery why Mark still bothers with him. At which point there's no redeeming Mark either. In short, In From The Side suffers from a weak narrative, a fatal lack of character development, and a more-than-slightly shaky moral compass. And at around two hours and forty minutes, it's a full hour longer than any basic romance has a right to be.",/review/rw8553568/?ref_=tt_urv

24 September 2022,brentsbulletinboard,6," Nice Try
","In-depth narrative features about lesser-known segments of the LGBTQ+ community don't exactly come along every day, so it's indeed heartening when one about life in one of them - specifically the gay male rugby kinship - makes an appearance in the movie market (even if primarily only at film festivals). What's less satisfying, however, is when such a release doesn't quite live up to its potential, as is the case with writer-director Matt Carter's second offering. In following the clandestine love affair of two London ruggers who attempt to conceal their secret romance from their partners and teammates, the film explores its share of ethical matters, as well as the hard choices involved in making decisions about when it's time to hold on to or to let go of existing relationships (especially when they appear to have run their course). However, in telling this story, the film drones on far too long and seriously needs to dial back some of its melodramatic soap opera tropes. It also could stand to lose some of its heavy-handed judgmentalism about open gay male relationships, arrangements that are fairly common (and, in many cases, reasonably healthy) in the LGBTQ+ community. To its credit, though, this production features an array of fine performances (particularly among its cast of colorful supporting characters), as well as excellent cinematography of the rough-and-tumble rugby matches. Sensitive viewers, though, should beware of some sexually explicit content in deciding whether to screen this offering. But then, given the picture's unfortunate shortcomings, viewers in general might want to consider that decision carefully as well. In my view, I'd wait until it becomes available for streaming - and an occasion when you've got time to spare.",/review/rw8553568/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,dkm1981,5," Another disappointment
","Another LGBT offering that seems to divide viewers from either thinking it was amazing or it was awful. Personally I thought it was disappointing. Other reviewers have already summed up most of what I thought was wrong with it. It just doesn't seem to work. Two guys both in unhappy relationships, have a toxic affair, one leaves his partner the other goes back to his then regrets the affair ending.",/review/rw8553568/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2023,act1966,4," A Mess
","I'm giving this four stars as it was shot beautifully but that's about it. The script is a mess and its portrayal of gay relationships and gay men is perplexing. I would've liked to see the story focus more on the rugby side of things rather than the unreal histrionics of the characters and their ""relationships"". There was little to no exposition about how they all came to rugby or how they got involved with their partners. It just didn't grab me on an emotional level and, by the end, we were mocking the characters for their inane choices and reactions. It's too bad: it was obvious there was considerable money spent on the filiming but they should've focused more of the budget on making major script revisions and the director should've been working with the actors to pull back their performances from the over-the-top styles most of them were employing.",/review/rw8553568/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2022,alexmarginson-02535,4," One to many montages
","This could have been a great film - unfortunately it was too long and wallowed in its own YouTube style filler music in far too many scenes. The core actors did a reasonable job, but the acting on the periphery was really laboured and felt amateurish - perhaps the script could have been sharper, I would say that this was understandable due to the budget, but most of the production quality was otherwise good.",/review/rw8553568/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2022,laduqesa,7," Not bored for an instant
","I was absolutely horrified to see people here comparing this film with the horrendously boring and irrelevant ""Weekend"" and claiming that this film based on a rugby club and two of its members suffered in comparison. Where ""Weekend"" was an actionless dirge about nothing, ""In from the side"" explored much more and did it in the context of a group of gay guys taking on the hettie world on their own terms and winning.",/review/rw8553568/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2022,Alexanders-2,7," Too long
","Gay films usually have only 2 themes. Most often they are coming-of-age stories, otherwise everything revolves around twisted passions that end either tragically or well. In from the Side is not exactly assessable, because despite the rather light tone, this is neither a comedy nor a tragedy. The matter-of-factness with which gayness is shown here, especially the environment of a tough man's sport, namely rugby, is very pleasant and I admit that Ryan Reynolds lookalike as Warren makes it very easy to get interested in the story. The main character, however, is Mark, who is in an unhappy relationship that guarantees him some wealth but a lot of emotional emptiness that also rubs off on his best friend. That's where Warren comes in, whose open relationship seems to be going better, but who falls in love with Mark. Both experience their ups and downs during their game of hide and seek, and in the end Mark has to make the decision of what he wants to do. A lot of eye candy, not very strong characterisation of all the characters, a loose narrative tone but without much depth make this film a watchable but overall too long pleasure that could have been better with a better focus on the characters.",/review/rw8553568/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,hipps-91464,10," Excellent Movie
","An emotionally gut wrenching beautiful story, beautifully told . Highly recommend this movie. Can't say enough good things about this movie, Acting, directing, script or all spot on. It doesn't hurt that the leads are beautiful men beautifully played but the acting takes the movie to a whole new level. Both leads have every emotional scenes that they pull off in extraordinary fashion. Just enough humor and sports male bonding to keep the movie balanced and enjoyable form beginning to end. You may need a tissue or two to get through to the end but you will be glad you did.",/review/rw8553568/?ref_=tt_urv

","I don't normally review films however this film is so real to life.....for one it's so lovely every scene both the two main characters are together and you feel that love, secondly the betrayal is so honest and real to their partners, thirdly the betrayal of the team mates..... In my mind a story doesn't just end, you can make your own ending.... But the love and intensity of the characters is unreal..... I absolutely love pinky! He is a genuine friend with a welsh accent..... the passion for sport really shines through this film.... This is a romance as well as drama and sport.....

25 December 2022,Radu_A,4," Queers with Beers (and Beards)
","This was me and my partner's Xmas movie and we were expecting a butch ménage à trois, not a Hallmark movie of the week romance flick. If you are gay (or know any gay man older than 18), you will know that we don't do jealousy. A precondition of any successful queer relationship is to separate sex from love. From the onset, the story feels really off, and we went from disbelief over chuckling to genuine confusion. Who was this made for? Single ladies in their 30s like Drag Race? Single guys in their 70s who have forgotten how sex works? Well, most likely straight film critics.",/review/rw8553568/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2023,moonspinner55,4," Aside from the detailed intimacy, we've been down this road before...
","British-made drama has two rugby players from opposing gay rugby teams sharing a one-night stand even though both men already have boyfriends; meanwhile, the financial foundation for the teams is on the verge of folding its sponsorship. Written by Matt Carter (who also directed) and Adam Silver, ""In From the Side"" opens with a flurry of activity on the field and, as we're introduced visually to the men on both teams--some of them roughhewn fellows with big, booming voices--I was hopeful Carter wouldn't select the two prettiest boys to focus his attention on (I was wrong). Is there some rule in Gay Cinema that the protagonists be sculpted and shyly (or moodily) handsome? Do filmmakers think showing sweaty, stocky men in love would derail our interest? In the interim, the writers give us lots of intimate clinches, arguments and pillow talk between the clandestine lovers and--be still our hearts--we get to accompany them to a carnival! Is the passion a turn on? Perhaps, but there's nothing much else here of interest except for the rugby asides--we've been down this road before.",/review/rw8553568/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,WlfrmG,6," not good, not bad
","Gay rugby players, good acting, very handsome guys... that should do it all, at least for a gay audience. However, the story is just too long. It is filmed and performed as if we are watching a great Greek tragedy, as if somebody is dying. However, tt is just about two handsome guys in relationships having an affair. This might be sad for some partners involved, but it is really not a big drama as presented in the movie. The story itself is okaish, but another director would make it to a comedy with some thoughtful moments. There are several longer scenes showing the guys playing rugby. Again. They are oakish, but Leni Riefenstahl, did that 85 years ago much better..",/review/rw8553568/?ref_=tt_urv

18 September 2022,aishcallum,1," First ever review.
","Ive never written a review before. But i hated every second of this movie so much its all i could think about. Save yourself 2 and a half hours and never watch this film. The dialog was painful, the characters bland and unlikable. It feels lile whoever made this move has no idea about being gay or even an adult. Its just awkward and goes nowhere. I audibly laughed at some points when there was triumphant music playing in the background of a meaningless scene. Some of the acting was downright laughable. Overall the worst movie ive ever seen in my life. Im not the kind of person to leave bad reviews. I just dont want other people to have to sit through this garbage.",/review/rw8553568/?ref_=tt_urv
