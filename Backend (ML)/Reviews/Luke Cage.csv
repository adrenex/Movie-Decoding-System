",I love the fact that this series is showing two different sides of two different characters. Great acting from both lead actors. I have fun and laugh when watching this. You just have to take your time to sit down and watch it for you to enjoy it.,/review/rw8602992/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2022,cambell-bennett,9," Sweet spot
","This show is aiming for a very niche audience: our, 'detective with a burden' is battier than Monk, drunker than House, smarter than Sherlock, and doesn't seem to have a gun, although the charming Leslie Ann Warren playing his mother loves guns and is seen cleaning and oiling a vast collection of antique muskets and rifles which she uses to deter the advances of our tec's giant pet alligator. Our grounded sidekick with their own life is a single mom who is also the cop in charge of collecting enough speeding tickets to balance the city budget. A previous reviewer took issue with the scene where Bellwether (of course that's his name, but most folks call him Bell) smokes Toad but it's a bravura bit, and the show spent a bunch of FX money animating the horns and flies and stuff. As for the niche bit, it's written with the headiest post-peak-tv dialogue imaginable - ""Do you prefer hefeweizen or muscadet with oysters?"" is used as a distraction - and the metatext is the application of therapeutic practices in the damaged lives of our subjects, and how they are both going to make each other better people. Catch it now, there's no way in hell anything this far up my alley is going to be renewed.",/review/rw8602992/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2022,AfricanBro,6," Not bad for what it's worth
","I don't know what exactly made me watch this, I found this show by chance and all I knew about it was Luke Kirby from his supporting role in Marvelous Mrs Maisel. It's not top draw acting, feel like it's on par with comedy skits or tiktoks, it's bearable it's just unbelievable. The opening sequence in the first episodes basically scream Florida man and that's pretty much what you get as the series progresses, a lot about the show just seems unrealistic or far fetched but it doesn't feel like the writers are trying to convince you it is.",/review/rw8602992/?ref_=tt_urv

","Funny, complex interactions between two different personality types I did not feel i needed a degree in psychology to understand the natural empathy between these characters.",/review/rw8602992/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is the perfect combination of mystery, drama and comedy.",/review/rw8602992/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2022,kindredparadox,2," I only watch show that have chemistry with me
","The point is finding main male character's deceased wife's killer. There are many banter or scenes between main male and main female. The male cannot really go outside his house, but go out nonetheless. The female, a traffic police, tempted to step up her job to investigate. Thus leveraged by the smartness of the male and his desire to find the killer.",/review/rw8602992/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2022,yerlo,1," Well, crap!
","First episode got me. Very quirky. Well acted. Tiana Okoye was terrific! I could watch her all day. The eccentric emotionally tortured genius (a character type I usually hate), Bell Prescott, managed to do it so quirkyly that I laughed and admired his inventiveness. I looked forward to lots of fun with this show. Then, the second episode was the turd in the punch bowl. Bell smoked something that immediately knocked him into a drugged nutty land where Tah Dah his brain worked better and he figured out a puzzle. Kids, it doesn't work this way. Then the porn. We clicked off never to return. Such potential. What a waste.",/review/rw8602992/?ref_=tt_urv
