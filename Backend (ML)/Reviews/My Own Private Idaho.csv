23 April 2003,Sargebri,," Dick Van Dyke's Second Most Famous Role
","Take one part Columbo, one part E.R. and one part the Dick Van Dyke Show and you get this great show.  Dick Van Dyke proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is one of the most versatile actors in the history of television. I think that this is most definitely his best role since Rob Petrie.  Also, like the Dick Van Dyke Show, this show relied on a great ensemble. Victoria Rowell, Barry Van Dyke and Charlie Schlatter were great supporting characters in this great show.  Too bad its not on the air anymore, I miss seeing it and its wonderful cast.",/review/rw4303294/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2002,Cheese-18,," How could they ever cancel this show???
","A big fat PFOOOEY for the executives that cancelled Diagnosis Murder! As you can see the show had followers all over the world. I sure do miss it. All that is left now is to watch the reruns. But as we say in Switzerland: As soon as the money-cow can't be milked anymore it is slaughtered. Which means Dick Van Dyke and his staff have served their purpose and are now dismissed. They didn't even get a fair chance to bring their ratings back on track. Just lose some points and you're OUT - no matter who or what you are. THAT's how it works nowadays, baby.",/review/rw4303294/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2001,4-Kane,," The most underrated 'whodunit' series
","I remember seeing the pre-series TV-movie ""Diagnosis of Murder"" in 1992, but I didn't watch the Diagnosis Murder TV series until the fall of 1997 (as it was starting its fifth season), when Robert Stack made a guest appearance in the episode ""Open and Shut.""  After that, I didn't watch the show again until January of 1998. That was when I finally started watching it on a regular basis.",/review/rw4303294/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 1999,ali-37,," New fan since end of Seinfeld
",I never watched this show in prime time. Then I started watching it on Pax TV at 10pm and I was hooked. Now I watch it in prime time rather than watching Frasier. I love the plots and the tongue in cheek dialogue. I especially love their theme shows filled with old TV stars. I like Dick Van Dyke in this better than as Rob Petrie.,/review/rw4303294/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2017,By-TorX-1,8," Hugely Enjoyable, But Dr Mark Sloan Is Murdered By Nepotism In The End
","Diagnosis Murder is very enjoyable 1990s hokum with a great initial cast that has a palpable sense of chemistry, even when Charlie Schlatter joins Dr Mark Sloan's merry medical sleuthing band to replace Scott Baio. The plots are fast-paced and Dick Van Dyke and Barry Van Dyke make an appealing team, with the marvellous Victoria Rowell shining in the role of the pathologist, Amanda. Also, there are even some nice TV crossovers with Mannix and Matlock getting in on the action. And one cannot forget the appearance of a vampire and a ghost! However, for all of the show's oodles of charm, things did start to go a bit awry when more and more of the Van Dyke clan progressively showed up. I was never a fan of Shane Van Dyke, and from there brothers, daughters, and granddaughters increasingly manifest on the glowing screen, with the ultimate tipping point being an episode that seems to contain the entire Van Dyke extended family, which was a bit much. However, there is much pleasure to be had from Dr Sloan's crime fighting ways, and the show is still on TV, which is perfectly splendid.",/review/rw4303294/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10," This is just such an entertaining show!
","This, like Murder She Wrote, is one of those shows, that after a stressful day at school, I sit down in front of the TV, and watch. Why? Because I genuinely enjoy it as it so entertaining and light-hearted, and it's a shame it's not on the air anymore. Dick Van Dyke is amazing as Dr Mark Sloan, a doctor-turned-detective, who with his son, solves murders. He is joined by a largely unknown but very competent supporting cast, namely his real-life son, Barry Van Dyke. Victoria Rowell is also good, but I noticed that every series her hairstyle changes. i also liked Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter, but I particularly loved Michael Tucci as Norman, and was puzzled how he suddenly disappeared. This show is so entertaining,with great guest stars, it's a bit obvious at times, like Colombo, but in every episode, there is always something to chuckle about. In conclusion, a great series, with two thumbs up and a 10/10. Bethany Cox",/review/rw4303294/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2003,richteabiscuit,9," Wonderful Whodunnit
","Thankfully as a student I have been able to watch ""Diagnosis Murder"" for a number of years now.  It is basically about a doctor who solves murders with the help of his LAPD son, a young doctor and a pathologist.  DM provided 8 seasons of exceptional entertainment.  What made it different from the many other cop shows and worth watching many times over was its cast and quality of writing.  The main cast gave good performances and Dick Van Dyke's entertainer roots shone through with the use of magic, dance and humor. The best aspects of DM was the fast pace, witty scripts and of course the toe tapping score.  Sadly it has been unfairly compared to ""Murder, She Wrote"". DM is far superior boasting more difficult mysteries to solve and more variety.  Now it is gone TV is a worse place.  Gone are the days of feelgood, family friendly cop shows.  Now there is just depressing 'gritty' ones.",/review/rw4303294/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2002,Spooky2001,," One of The Greatest Shows Of All Time
","If you say you won't watch Diagnosis Murder because you think it is a copy of Murder She Wrote.  Then you should not dismiss this show just because of that.  It is a great show with good actors.  This show blends mystery, action, and humor.  Dick Van Dyke is excellent as Mark Slone.  Too bad the show is over but there is always repeats on Pax.  If you haven't seen Diagnosis Murder then you don't know what you are missing.",/review/rw4303294/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2001,Thor2000,," The Greatest Show That You Aren't Watching
","For the first few episodes, I thought it was wierd to see Van Dyke play a doctor,but this show has really become one of the few shows that I will watch anymore. It has gotten a lot better since Baio left the series, and the episodes just keep getting better and better. Dick and his son have a wonderful camaraderie, and the mysteries and characters work very well. The Matlock crossover was my favorite, as are the cameo episodes where all the familiar stars return. I hope this show lasts as long as Dick wants to do it.",/review/rw4303294/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2001,CLIFF-43,," Let's not forget Norman
","We in the UK have just enjoyed a summer during which I have enjoyed Hallmark TV reruns of the Diagnosis Murder series it showed earlier.  I must agree with most other commentators that this is a great series with good plots, scripts and humour in which the four leads really do 'gel' to make a thoroughly enjoyable series.  Dick van Dyke is truly one of the greats and yet never seems to outshine the other who clearly enjoy their work -- a fact that shines out of the screen in every episode.",/review/rw4303294/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2018,tles7,8," Fun show to watch. Dick Van Dyke is quite charismatic.
","I never watched the show when it was on. But now, catching it on MeTV.. Besides gaining a huge crush on Victoria Rowell, the rest of the cast is also fun to watch. As the show progressed through its run though, the stories became more far-fetched. Dr. Sloane is more of a Hercule Poirot than a doctor. So, the reality of the roles have to be forfeited. However, the show is very entertaining and some are quite suspenseful.",/review/rw4303294/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2001,Mr. OpEd,," Perhaps the best 60 minutes on TV today.
","I have to concur with the person who says it just keeps getting better. It truly does. It's gone from a good show to one that's truly running on all cylinders AND using jet fuel (usually the opposite is true of a series, no?). Sure, I like looking at the amazing Victoria Rowell as much as my wife likes looking at the manly Barry Van Dyke and we both like it when Dick Van Dyke gives the Los Angeles Times its ever well-deserved missive spanking because some sliver-nosed critic doesn't ""get it"" and starts talkin' the show trash. And of course, there's Dick Debenedictis' ever evolving theme and the other composers who make the show shine. Catch it on PAX. Catch it new on CBS. This is a class show all the way, more Rockford and Colombo than just about anything out there today.",/review/rw4303294/?ref_=tt_urv

26 May 2002,lynchboy2001,," Doctor Death
","This programme really is ""Murder, She Wrote In Hospital""! What's really funny is the amount of guff the audience has to swallow. No.1: Dick van Dyke, although a doctor, is rarely in the hospital working, instead doing tests on a murder that took place which his son is working on. He also looks after his restaurant & taught a class. 2: The hospital only has 4 members of staff, & very few patients, if it can allow their doctors to leave the hospital to investigate crime. In fact, the only time they are in surgery is to save someone involved in the case. 3: van Dyke Jr. doesnt need a partner, & his doctor father can interrogate suspects. 4: Not once does the killer question van Dyke Sr. on his authority, they just accept a crime-fighting doctor! The list goes on!! This programme is absolute nonsense, & is an old person's show. Thank god its gone!",/review/rw4303294/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2010,EdwardCarter,1," Worst series ever
","Just a stilted rip-off of the infinitely better ""Murder, She Wrote"", it is absolutely amazing that this poorly-written garbage lasted for a full eight years. I'm sure most of the people who watched this unentertaining crap were in their sixties and seventies and just tuned in because they had nothing better to do, or simply remembered its star from the old Dick Van Dyke Show. Van Dyke, who only had a decent career in the 1960s, never was much of an actor at all (by his own admission) and he was already far too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993. He looks absolutely ancient as a result of years of chain smoking and heavy drinking. His talentless real life son Barry, a wooden actor who has rarely been in anything that didn't involve his father, plays his son in the series.",/review/rw4303294/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2006,tamstrat,," Not bad considering...
","I liked the series in the early years, it leaned a little towards the geriatric set, kind of a male based ""Murder She Wrote"", but Dick Van Dyke is a great actor so I enjoyed watching him portray the amiable Dr. Mark Sloan. He worked well with his real life son, Barry Van Dyke. The series was well written in the beginning, but towards the end it got really lame. It seemed that every episode featured the whole ""Van Dyke"" clan, and sadly to say, none of them could act with the exception of Dick and Barry. I've heard of nepotism but this took the cake, and some of the story lines got really,really out there, especially ""The Blair Nurse Project"" which had the young Van Dykes searching (and yikes-finding) there is a ghost in the basement of Community General Hospital. The series was cancelled shortly thereafter and I wasn't surprised. Occasionally I will watch the reruns on the PAX network or Hallmark Channel and I do enjoy them in small doses.",/review/rw4303294/?ref_=tt_urv
