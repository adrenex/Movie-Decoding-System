22 March 2009,Coventry,8," Half Man ... Half Ant ... All Terror! Joe Dante's simply delicious B-movie tribute!
","This isn't such a very well known film (at least I never heard of it before I watched it) and actually that is a god-awful shame, as ""Matinee"" is a joyously vivid, versatile and refreshingly imaginative little comedy. ""Matinee"" is director Joe Dante's ultimate tribute to typically 50's Sci-Fi B-movies and massively promoted gimmick-laden low-budget flicks; particularly the repertoire of the legendary William Castle. In one of his most glorious roles to date, John Goodman depicts the unscrupulous and sleazy horror movie producer Lawrence Woolsey, who is practically the reincarnation of William Castle, what with his sly and shameless salesmanship techniques and continuous wide-mouthed smile. At the highpoint of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, Woolsey jaunts out to Key West  where the Navy and population hectically prepares for a bomb attack  in order to proudly present his newest and supposedly most shocking motion picture named ""Mant"". ""Mant"" is a silly shock feature about a man slowly mutating into a gigantic ant after being exposed to nuclear radiation, and for the big premiere Woolsey stuffed the film theater with horrid decorations and gimmicks to raise extra fear in the audience. With the threat of actual bombing attack going on outside the theater, Woolsey bumps into a lot of protest and resistance from the adult population in Key West, but luckily the younger and horror-crazed generation are wildly enthusiast about the upcoming matinée preview. With ""Matinee"", the still incredibly underrated director Joe Dante delivered another delicious and charming movie. The extended bits and clips from the fictional movie ""Mant"" masterfully capture the essence of 1950's B-movie cinema, with grotesque ideas and effects, cheesy nonsensical dialogs and wooden acting performances. The real William Castle actually never made such a type of monster movie, but the gimmicks and promotional stunts (like buzzers underneath the seats and guys in rubber suits running around) are right up his delightful alley! But ""Matinee"" is a terrifically clever movie on other levels as well. Apart from a wonderful homage to horror cinema, it also contains an admirable ""coming of age"" sub plot and it effectively parodies the mass hysteria going on around the time of the Cold War. Whilst the adult population of Key West practices their duck & cover bomb alarms and prepare their shelters, the teenagers are more concerned about finding a date to go see ""Mant"" on Saturday. The acting performances are fantastic (like his monster ""Mant"", John Goodman himself is larger than life!), the decors and atmosphere of the early 60's are marvelously re-enacted and  in good old Joe Dante tradition  there are multiple cameos of horror veterans, like Dick Miller, Kevin McCarthy and Robert Cornthwaite. This is truly a film meant for genuine horror movie buffs, but nevertheless a stupendously enjoyable comedy for all type of audiences.",/review/rw2325552/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2003,Infofreak,," 'Matinee' is light-hearted fare, sure, but lots of fun for movie buffs who love b-grade 1950s and 1960s monster movies.
","I have a lot of time for Joe Dante. Most of his movies are fairly light-hearted, nostalgic fare aimed at kids or the young at heart, but unlike his occasional collaborator Steven Spielberg he really pulls it off convincingly without getting too sentimental and treacly, and always has enough in-jokes and references in his movies to amuse diehard science fiction and horror film buffs. Dante is a BIG fan of film makers like Roger Corman (who gave him his big break), William Castle (a major inspiration for 'Matinee') and Mario Bava, while one has to wonder if Spielberg even knows who they are. 'Matinee' is a slight, but very entertaining picture, concerning b-grade 50s/60s horror movies, and fans of that era will absolutely love it. John Goodman ('The Big Lebowski') plays flamboyant writer/director Lawrence Woolsey. Woolsey's gimmicks and showmanship are inspired by William Castle ('The Tingler', '13 Ghosts', 'House On Haunted Hill',etc.etc.) though the fictional movie 'Mant' which is part of the plot is quite unlike Castle's output and closer to 50s paranoid monster movies like 'Them!' and 'Tarantula'. Goodman is perfectly cast and loads of fun. I also really liked Cathy Moriarty ('Raging Bull') as Woolsey's leading actress/assistant. The chemistry between the two was enjoyable and made for some nice comic touches. The young kid actors were all pretty good, and Dante regulars Dick Miller ('A Bucket Of Blood'), Kevin McCarthy ('Invasion Of The Body Snatchers'), Robert Picardo ('Star Trek Voyager') and William Schallert ('The Incredible Shrinking Man') seem like they are all having a wonderful time. Trivia buffs note that this movie includes an actor from 'The Thing From Another World' (Robert Cornthwaite) and also one from John Carpenter's remake 'The Thing' (David Clennon'). The movie within the movie 'Mant' is hilarious, but I enjoyed the whole thing. 'Matinee' is another fun movie from the underrated Joe Dante.",/review/rw2325552/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2005,lee_eisenberg,10," Ah, the Cuban Missile Crisis...
","Yes, the atomic bomb is terrible. But unintentionally funny were some of the movies about the alleged effects of atomic mutation. Hi, I want to tell you about something that could have happened. Something that does happen in a certain movie. Picture Key West, Florida: your average American town. But, if a movie about the alleged effects of atomic mutation was brought there during the Cuban Missile Crisis...the result would be hysterical indeed. For the result...would be...""Matinée"".",/review/rw2325552/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2002,Tommy-5,," A pleasant stroll down Memory Lane
","`Half Man, Half Ant, All Terror!,' screams the promotional for fictional film producer Lawrence Woolsey's newest film, Mant. Mant is the film within the 1993 film titled Matinee. 	Matinee, starring John Goodman as the William Castle-like Woolsey, is director Joe Dante's valentine to all of us who grew up in the middle of the cold war. That he has managed to combine a salute to the science fiction films of the 1950's and early 60's with a warning about nuclear power and human imperfection is quite impressive. 	The plotline is straightforward. Woolsey and his delightful lover, leading lady and all around Girl Friday Ruth, ably played by Cathy Moriarty, (who shows she could have been a great 50's sci-fi heroine), roll into Key West, Florida for a sneak preview of his latest film, Mant. The weekend of the big event, autumn of 1962, also happens to be the time of the Cuban missile crisis. Here the story gets a little stretched as we try to keep up with all that is going on. Panicky theatre managers, adolescent love and jealousy, and several amusing scenes from Mant are among the many points of interest against the sobering backdrop of the missile crisis, only 90 miles away in Cuba. This film is a bit hard to describe, the best thing to do is rent it and enjoy it for yourself. Much of it takes place in the theatre on Saturday afternoon and is a true trip down memory lane for old guys like me who lived during this era and remember very well what indoor theatres were like in 1962. 	Mant is a special treat for all of us who love the sci-fi films of that era. It has several un-credited science fiction legends in it (Kevin McCarthy, William Schallert and Robert Cornthwaite appeared with the sultry Moriarty) and numerous insider jokes. McCarthy was `General Ankrum.' Oh Brother! Is there a sci-fi fan anywhere who is not aware that the late Morris Ankrum made a career of portraying military generals in these types of films? This is only one example of a ton of fun in this film. 	There were other appearances by old time favorites, such as Jesse White and Roger Corman regular Dick Miller. It is obvious that everyone had a good time making Matinee and just about all of the performances are way over the top, especially Goodman's. He held his oversized stogie just like Castle used to. 	I've heard that there are more Mant scenes in the DVD version of Matinee but I have been unable to locate what has turned out to be a harder to obtain film that I imagined it would or should be. 	Matinee is a warm-hearted gem. By all means make the effort to see this one if you can obtain a copy. I promise, you will not be disappointed.",/review/rw2325552/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2003,sawyertom,," A Very Good Parody and Dedication of Great B Movie Memories
","I had just recently watched Matinee for the first time in a few years. I forgot how much fun and how very funny a film it was. Having grown up watching some of William Castle's and Roger Corman's hokey but very entertaining early horror films it was like a stroll down memory lane on my Saturday's. Goodman captured the essence of a movie showman who always had or wanted to have a gimmick to go with his B movie pictures. Cathy Moriarty is excellent as his favorite leading lady. I must be showing my age because I still remember the duck and cover and other little things associated with everyday life and times during the late 1950's and early 1960's that were in the movie. The movie was entertaining and a very nice parody, if not dedication to the men who made B movies as part of our culture. I have to believe this dedication to men like Corman and Castle would have to be a bit of a tongue in cheek parody for it to be a very sincere dedication. The movie does an excellent job of bring back the life and times and the performances as pretty good. Aaaahhhh the memories. The cold war and much simpler times and classic B movies. It don't get any better than this.",/review/rw2325552/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2002,a-j-zak,8," An under-rated gem
","One of those films that deserved to reach a huge audience but somehow slipped away, Joe Dante's affectionate homage to creature features and B-movie king William Castle is a joy from start to finish. This is due to both Dante's direction - and obvious love of the script - and John Goodman's delightful performance (what was he doing in crap like ""Coyote Ugly?""). Even the movie-within-a-movie - ""Mant!"" (""half man, half ant - all terror!"") is fun. The only downside is that this rarely turns up on TV and hasn't been released on DVD in the UK. A scratchy vhs is better than nothing I suppose...",/review/rw2325552/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2006,DavidSim240183,10," One of Joe Dante's most overlooked and underrated films
","Joe Dante is a true enthusiast for classic sci-fi and horror films. His affection for the genre shines through in every film he's made. Matinée may be the best example of that, because this lovingly crafted homage to classic schlock merchant William Castle not only succeeds as an entertaining feature, but also as a knowing commentary on the changing attitudes of our time.",/review/rw2325552/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2011,AlsExGal,7," Tribute to those old horror films of the 50's and 60's
","I felt that the advertising for this movie was somewhat misleading. I expected to see a film about John Goodman portraying a loose characterization of showman William Castle. Instead, the main focus of the film is a young boy, Gene Loomis, whose father is a soldier who is dispatched to active duty during the Cuban missile crisis, which is the time period in which this film is set. You have your typical coming-of-age themes revolving around Gene and his friends as they discover their own emerging adolescence, and this consists largely of tired material that has been done to death.",/review/rw2325552/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2001,Longboat88,10," Funny, Purely Cinematic and Fantastic.
","This has to be the most under-rated, under-valued and criminally under-seen film of all time. Funny, touching, nostalgic in a good way, a wonderful tribute to the very joy of film itself and, the clincher, a cast of kids that never get on your nerves. And even in any of the Coen Brother's films he has been in, John Goodman has never bettered his performance from this movie. If you love the movies, you'll love this film. See it; then see it again and again. It really is the undiscovered artistic masterpiece of the 20th Century.",/review/rw2325552/?ref_=tt_urv

","Gene Loomis is a teenager living on a naval base in Key West in 1962, just as the Cuban Missile Crisis occurs and worldwide tension mounts. At the same time, Lawrence Woolsey, a schlock moviemaker, is premiering his new monster movie, Mant!, at the local theatre. Gene meets Woolsey, who teaches him some tricks of the trade, and Gene and his friend Stan go to the premiere which involves, amongst other things, a mad beatnik in a giant ant costume, Gene getting locked in a nuclear fallout shelter, and Woolsey destroying the entire theatre.",/review/rw2325552/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2000,BaronBl00d,," You Gotta Have a Gimmick!
","Certainly John Goodman portraying Lawrence Woolsey as a film director bent on all kinds of creative devices to lure audiences in to see his sci-fi/horror movies is a homage to the King of Gimmicks himself, William Castle.  This movie is not great by any standards, but it sure is a lot of fun.  It is a trip down memory lane for many.  Although I am not old enough to remember the Cuban Missile Crisis nor William Castle movies premiering, I am given a pretty accurate feel of the times through Matinee.  The best part of the movie, however, is the movie within a movie....MANT...the story of a man that is half-man and half-ant.  The scenes of this film alone are good enough reason to see Matinee.  The one scene where the Mant character throws an ant farm to the ground and yells ""You're free, You're free"" is hilarious. The movie characters are also made up of old sci-fi stars Kevin McCarthy(Invasion of the Body Snatchers), William Shallert(Hundreds of films it seems), and Robert Cornwaithe(The Thing).  Also look for John Sayles and Dick Miller in smaller roles hamming it up.  Goodman is larger than life in his portrayal, much the same way that Castle was.  And certainly, we in the audience that are great genre fans dream what it would have been like to help William Castle...I mean Lawrence Woolsey...make a picture.",/review/rw2325552/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2016,Leofwine_draca,8," Loving recreation of a unique era
","You could well describe Matinée as Joe Dante's most mature and reflective work and also one of his very best movies. It's a criminally underrated film that only seems to be enjoyed by those who love and respect B-movies as much as the characters in the film, but for my money it's one of the most loving and respectful cinematic dedications in existence and miles ahead of overrated fare like Scorsese's HUGO.",/review/rw2325552/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2017,PredragReviews,9," ""We want Mant, we want Mant!""
","All or most of director Joe Dante's films can be considered fun popcorn movies, something that is for both the kids and the adults, for genre fans and for fans of film in general. Dante gained recognition with the huge hit Gremlins, which Steven Spielberg produced. But in 1993, Dante decided to make a rather personal film, a pseudo-biography of filmmaker and 'shock-expert,' William Castle, renamed in the film 'Matinee' as Lawrence Woolsey (played with the perfect amount of schlock by John Goodman). John Goodman has never bettered his performance from this movie. Best thing about this story is Goodman's b&w movie, Mant! It's loaded with bad puns like, (Bill's wife:) ""Oh, why can't they see Bill as a man and just put the insect aside?"" Bill, who's been transformed into a giant ant panics and says, ""Insecticide??!!??"" Goodman uses two minor fright film actors to stir up trouble (and publicity) in town by bad mouthing Mant.",/review/rw2325552/?ref_=tt_urv

17 October 2010,zetes,7," Fun, but I expected it to be better
","Not really a horror movie, per se, but a family comedy that revolves around B-horror movies. John Goodman plays a William Castle-like horror filmmaker who is premiering his new movie Mant (half-man, half-ant!) in Key West during the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Goodman has imagined Mant as a very interactive experience, with rumbling seats that can give the audience light shocks, pyrotechnics and a man wearing a Mant suit who wanders into the audience at certain points. The movie mostly revolves around the children who are going to see the movie. The film has a lot of problems. The kid characters are all pretty uninteresting, and the main plot of the film, which is about Simon Fenton, a horror fan, missing his father, who is in the military on a boat outside of Cuba, reeks of grade C Spielberg. And the screenwriters figure that they can't have a movie where people are just sitting around watching another movie, so there are a whole bunch of subplots where the kids wander off during the movie to do other stuff. Ironically, the parts where we're watching Mant are by far the best part of the movie. I've heard so much about how good this was for years, and been wanting to see it forever (it was out of print on DVD for years), so I have to say it's a pretty big disappointment. Still, I think it's an okay movie.",/review/rw2325552/?ref_=tt_urv
