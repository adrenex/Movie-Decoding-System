9 May 2022,matthewssilverhammer,8," I don't understand the disdain for this.
","Other than Crowe's singing (which isn't terrible), the musical absurdities (which is just a wavelength thing), & its extreme sincerity (which I consider a strength), it's pretty unimpeachable. There are so many powerful moments: Do You Hear?, Empty Chairs at Empty Tables, the battle on the garbage barricade, etc...and, of course, I Dreamed a Dream. Say what you will about Hathaway being a bit much at times; she was put on this earth to perform that scene.",/review/rw2729069/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2014,CalRhys,," A Well-Executed And Powerful Musical
","A well-executed and powerful musical from Tom Hooper, 'Les Misérables' stood alongside 'Skyfall' as Britain's two main entries at the 2013 Academy Awards and left with 3 Oscars. Featuring some bravura performances from an all-star cast including Anne Hathaway (Oscar winner), Hugh Jackman (Oscar nominated), Russell Crowe, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter. Set against the sweeping backdrop of 19th-century France, 'Les Mis' tells an enthralling and emotional story of passion, love and redemption, accompanied by some stunning cinematography, uplifting musical numbers and flawless direction. While it does drag on at parts, 'Les Mis' is generally an impeccably crafted musical to be enjoyed by all.",/review/rw2729069/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2012,rogerdarlington,," Even if you don't like musicals, you really should see this one
","As a massive film fan, my tastes are very wide-ranging, but I do have a problem with musicals. Nevertheless I was happy to take the opportunity of a private viewing of ""Les Misérables"" at the London office of distributors Universal - the day after the London première and a month before the UK release - because of the outstanding success of the original stage show (a run of 27 years with a total audience of over 60 million) and the surprising and impressive cast list (Russell Crowe, Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter, Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne).

21 February 2013,TheLittleSongbird,9," Simply splendid
","Despite the somewhat mixed reviews, I really wanted to see Les Miserables. I love the musical, it is not the most accessible of musicals- it is lengthy and feels very like an opera(a genre that I adore but can see why others don't)- but it never fails to give me goosebumps or move me and the music is just incredible. I wouldn't go as far to say that this movie version is completely flawless, there are occasions where the camera angles are a little dizzying and Russell Crowe has an underpowered and nasal timbre that doesn't really appeal to me(it also has a soft-grained rock-opera style that is at odds with the rest of the singing). But I found it a simply splendid film on its own merits as well as a solid adaptation of both the musical and the book.",/review/rw2729069/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2020,mikayakatnt,10," A BRILLIANT Adaptation of the Play and Novel
",A near three-hour epic that one wishes was longer. The songs and emotions will be stuck with you long after you watch this film. A brilliant adaptation of the play.,/review/rw2729069/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2021,mickman91-1,8," You need to know the history and context - Les Mis the novel and Les Mis the musical before attempting this. Then you can appreciate what they were trying to do.
","This is a really tricky one to talk about. Its place in the Les Mis repertoire is confusing to newcomers and the reviews are polarised which is also confusing, but I understand why.",/review/rw2729069/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2012,Gordon-11,," an amazing masterpiece
","This film tells the story of a man who stole a piece of bread to feed his sister's child. He was in jail for almost twenty years. He lives a fugitive life, complicated by his pledge to help raise the daughter of an unfortunate woman.",/review/rw2729069/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2012,Danusha_Goska,8," Why We Pay to Watch Others Suffer
","Les Miserables is very old fashioned entertainment. It's a series of crescendo moments with no build-up, no backstory, no pause. It's like eating just the topping of the pecan pie, and not bothering with the crust or filling. We were just ten minutes into the movie when I had to look at my watch and ask, okay, how long can they keep this up? Climax after climax, plot twist after plot twist, tearjerking scene after tearjerking scene. Oceans! Mountains! Punishment! Suffering! Religion! Redemption! Will there be a break for lunch? Will we be able to catch our breath? ",/review/rw2729069/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2012,antesdespues,10," Breathtaking - A Musical with Heart
","I went to an awards screening of Les Miserables and left the cinema speechless. Tom Hooper's direction and the cinematography, costumes, art design and editing are nothing short of genius.",/review/rw2729069/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2012,tinulthin,9," Les Misérables
","The guiding ethic of any film adaptation of a legendary source must be: ""Change as little as possible."" Those in charge of Les Miz knew precisely what they were working with. A few songs are shortened, a handful of lines altered, and a few scenarios condensed or adapted to their original literary form, but the whole remains gloriously and satisfyingly intact.",/review/rw2729069/?ref_=tt_urv

","Sing Song Talking gets real tiring. I thought I could take it, but after an hour of Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe sing talking, it really got on my nerves.",/review/rw2729069/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2013,mistabobdobolina,5," The staging was spectacular, but... the singing?
","I rented this and, as a lifelong fan of the musical who has grown up with productions and recordings, I tried to keep my expectations in check and my mind open. But, wow... I really found myself struggling to make it all the way through.",/review/rw2729069/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2014,bob the moo,," Starts strong but doesn't stay as good
","It should be said that while I do enjoy the occasional musical, I'm not really one to seek them out as they tend not to be naturally my thing; indeed my favorite musical is the South Park film, mainly because it manages to have its genre cake and mock it at the same time. So it took me a few minutes to get into the big chorus, singing dialogue thing here but early on I did. To speak of the first hour I had characters I engaged with, songs that mostly are memorable (although the singing is variable) and generally plenty of spectacle and flair in the delivery. The first hour of the film is by far the strongest and it contains a lot of the most emotionally moving aspects.",/review/rw2729069/?ref_=tt_urv

11 December 2012,Kaite927,10," Magnificent Adaptation
","This film is amazing. Absolutely incredible. I don't understand what people are saying about pacing issues, I thought it flowed beautifully. The changes made worked very well. And I didn't think there was any weak link in the cast. I honestly loved Russell as Javert. He wasn't traditional by any means, but what he did worked. ",/review/rw2729069/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2013,aharmas,2," Les Horribles
","I went into this film with high hopes since the cast has some very talented actors, and then I remember it was a musical, and most of these people can't sing. ""Phantom of the Opera"" had a similar problem with its lead performer; however the leading lady was superb, and the direction quite spectacular, and it didn't hurt that the songs were good. That's not the case with this big, horrible mess.",/review/rw2729069/?ref_=tt_urv

17 December 2012,The_Film_Cricket,4," Tom Hooper got it right, this is a very good movie.
","To even attempt a movie version of the musical ""Les Misérables"" may be an act of insanity. There are few musical productions more beloved or more memorized, and so the end result is either going to be success or a colossal failure. Seeing the finished product, it can be confidently said that director Tom Hooper, brings together a full-blooded production that is not shy. He pulls out all the stops, takes no prisoners and creates a big, lavish, garish, but always entertaining adaptation of a musical that leaves subtlety smoldering in the dust. Is it sad? Is it melancholy? Is it full of grimness and death? You bet, but hey, it's Les Misérables.",/review/rw2729069/?ref_=tt_urv

25 December 2012,DoctorNordo,10," The definitive Les Miserables movie experience!
","As someone who has been burned by every single Hollywood adaptation of Les Miserables, let me categorically state that this time it was done right! Everything from the acting to the music to the sets was borderline perfect. The only thing that could possibly be considered a negative was something that was absolutely unavoidable. That is, when you are taking a novel as voluminous as Les Miserables and condensing it into a feature length movie, some things will be cut or rushed. This is no exception. The movie moves at breakneck speed. Anyone who is fond of the Broadway musical will no doubt not be bothered by it, but people new to the story or those who have only read the novel might be put off by it.",/review/rw2729069/?ref_=tt_urv
