","This is a great follow up, this film like the first is full of great one liners, and the murders are just as amusing. The characters/cast are fun and enjoyable. You really get the feeling everyone is having a great time on set. Would recommend people to check it out if your looking for a bit of fun and nothing serious.",/review/rw7445314/?ref_=tt_urv

2 April 2021,diegocoda,5," It felt like a parody of the first one!
","I felt it very dumb and even I got some scary movie vibes in comparison to the first one that was funny and all that but interesting, this one was just a disappointment because I liked the first one and there is a way to kill the saga. After all, they feel like two different genres and styles.",/review/rw7445314/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2020,dar0417,7," Solid follow up
",The first film was great and this film didn't miss a beat. Same comedy to horror ratio with tons of laughs. The way they bring back the original dead cast was brilliant. Fans will not be disappointed.,/review/rw7445314/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2020,maanikroda,4," Man, I was disappointed by this movie.
","I loved the first one and was ecstatic to see the sequel. Unfortunately, this movie lost nearly all the charm that made the first one so good; was riddled with plot holes; and most of all, suffered from a severe lack of Samara Weaving.",/review/rw7445314/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2020,fai-90435,8," Why is he still shirtless?
","This movie was just straight up hilarious. It never got like it was getting boring or going to fast. If you liked the first one you're definitely gonna enjoy this one, maybe even more. The characters were hilarious to watch even if they had little screen time but overall one of the few Netflix movies that feels like it's done well even for a sequel.",/review/rw7445314/?ref_=tt_urv

13 September 2020,jack-39973,7," It's ok.
","Not as good as the first one, but fun enough and enjoyable. The ending saved the movie from being a disappointing sequel.
I was surprised about the cast. But I don't want to spoil yet.",/review/rw7445314/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2020,kosmasp,8," Comedy Horror up to 11
","You don't have to have seen the first movie to enjoy this one, but it does make sense. Also you will know if this is for you. The second one adds even more humor, at least at first. In the beginning this feels like another American Pie ... the humor would fit, including a father walking in on you ... or is he? And are you? Sometimes just having a certain predicament is funny, even if the truth is not that important but the perception.",/review/rw7445314/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2020,UniqueParticle,8," Different vibe but still great
","Lost it's touch I understand the hate regardless I love the movie! Glad it's by the same director McG is wonderful at his craft, I enjoy almost his films. The Babysitter:Killer Queen is more violent than the first one which I appreciate quite a bit being a huge horror fan! Beautiful cinematography and characters unfortunate that it has several flaws/ under appreciated. The soundtrack is incredible too. Also Emily Alan Lind is gorgeous eye candy which is nice.",/review/rw7445314/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2020,mrkesu,2," What happened?
","Why does this feel so different from the first? It's like they did a ""Scary Movie"" version... It's just full on nonsense.",/review/rw7445314/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2020,aidanratesmovies,4," Sigh...here we go again...
","A mostly pointless, forced, and incredibly formulaic sequel- The Babysitter: Killer Queen is not only a horror installment that didn't need to happen, but a very odd film, that bears the question all throughout, why? Besides the films many frustrating and cliche moments, it does keep a consistent enough pace to keep you entertained. For horror fans, who don't mind the content as long as it is entertaining, the film is a rather average sequel with the same flaws as the first film. Unfortunately for me, being entertaining, was simply not enough. This film is absolutely braindead, with the script having the intelligence level of a very violent 7 year old. There is nothing new about this film, nothing exciting, nothing memorable, and absolutely nothing special. It's just incredibly bland. The acting is as mediocre as the first film, and though the film does seem to finally give us a somewhat interesting character (Phobe), Jenna Ortega's performance just doesn't seem to fit the character on screen, and it ends up making her performance look a bit forced. However, there is very little about this film that isn't forced, whether it is its outlandish plot, plot twists, or incredibly lack of originality- the film doesn't feel like it should have been made, let alone attempted. In the end, The Babysitter: Killer Queen is an unneeded sequel on all fronts, and I would be completely fine with the franchise dying here before this franchise can somehow get even worse out of hand.
My Rating: 4.5/10",/review/rw7445314/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2020,MrAwesome1022,4," Someone Really Thought This Was A Good Idea
","I enjoyed The Babysitter, however, The Babysitter: Killer Queen had very little in common with the first film. The issues come down to Brian Duffield not being retained as the screenwriter. The team of McG (also Director of both films), Dan Lagana, Jimmy Warden, and Brad Morris cobbled together a film full of unrelated film references and teenage sex jokes.",/review/rw7445314/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2020,Tweetienator,3," Very Disappointed
","I liked The Babysitter (2017) but this sequel I even could not finish - it is not funny, it is not creepy, and all in all the humor (just those scenes in the school. feel like the copy of a copy of a copy and than some copy more...) felt very shallow, stale and forced - but maybe I am not the right audience for The Babysitter: Killer Queen, and all those kids born after 2k will like it more. Anyway, more and more Netflix is for me a synonym or label for mass-products and bad ""entertainment"".",/review/rw7445314/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2020,jackdeth_2006,9," Switch off and enjoy this fun film
","I was a big fan of the original, so I was quite pleased and also a little apprehensive when I saw this sequel drop on Netflix. Turns out there was no need to worry.",/review/rw7445314/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2020,lestatbesa,8," The Babysitter is Back!!!
","Its hilarious, gruesome, and fun as its predecessor with a bit of tweak. Cole Johnson is same as last time and casting is great for this genre of horror comedy.. A campy coming of age slasher horror that is entertaining and campy. The story is about the blood cult and this movie is deserved an instant cult following. It seems McG is direction is perfect for this kind of film. I believe this have double twist ending that you look out for..This deserved another sequel.",/review/rw7445314/?ref_=tt_urv

",Babysitter: Killer Queen is just a fun modern slasher with a lot of gore.,/review/rw7445314/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2020,brandonmckay8,9," Is the sequel better than the original?!
","Netflix's best film in my opinion has dropped an incredible sequel that might just be better than the original. It keeps all the things you love about the first & goes even crazier in this one! The addition of Jenna to the cast was a great casting choice. Her chemistry with Judah was perfect. I am so happy they utilised Andrew Bachelor more in this one because his comedic timing & delivery is incredible. Giving Cole's dad (Ken Marino) more scenes was a nice touch too, brilliant comedy with Chris Wylde. Hana Mae Lee didn't get as much as I would've liked but still was great in what she had. Bella Thorne is so funny in this role, I loved her news reporting back story & freak out! The deaths were so over the top it was just exactly what you want from this film! & most importantly, Samara Weaving returns with a cameo at the end that truly pushed this film from an 8 to a 9. It was great to see her again & a well kept secret of her return.",/review/rw7445314/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2020,rocketwoods,2," Rushed, ruined and horrible editing.
","The Babysitter was an underrated and guilty watch. This is the one you turn off after 15 minutes or never finish. It's cartoony, forced jokes, editing is horrible.. There's no reason this should've been made, since the first one was such a ""standalone"". if you need a movie to fall asleep on, this is the one.",/review/rw7445314/?ref_=tt_urv

13 September 2020,madonnicallysony,6," Good pace!
","Ok so this was #4 trending movie in India on Netflix. The pace is good but is purely made pf adolescents as some scenes are meh! The slasher parts are really good, cinematography is awesome but the movie has no plot. Its one of those movies you can just binge watch! Just remember : Dont use your brain :D",/review/rw7445314/?ref_=tt_urv

","First movie was awesome. And this one started off pretty good..Even though nothing made any sense, it was still fun up until the end...Which is complete garbage.

15 October 2021,kelly-gaudreau,9," WTF
","If you did not like the original there is no point in seeing this one. While watching the first I found myself yelling, ""WTF just happened!?!"" Well, this one had me yelling, ""WTF just happened...AGAIN!?!"" It's hilarious, it's gory, and it's confusing. Just sit back and wonder...WTF.",/review/rw7445314/?ref_=tt_urv
