18 December 2019,AlsExGal,9," A most unusual romance
","In early 1950's Britain, Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) is the most sought-after dress designer among the rich and powerful. He lives a regimented, almost monastic life, with his watchful sister Cyril (Lesley Manville) as his close associate. One day Reynolds meets waitress Alma (Vicky Krieps) and takes her on as his muse, model, lover, whatever he needs. Alma learns that she's not the first to fill this position in Reynolds' life, but she becomes determined to be the last.",/review/rw4377114/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2018,classicsoncall,7," ""There is an air of quiet death in this house and I do not like the way it smells.""
","This story might be considered in the realm of one getting in life what they deserve. There came a point in the film where it became completely ludicrous why Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his paramour Alma (Vicky Krieps) should have remained together. That would have been the first instance in which Alma went the poison mushroom route, and I was kind of intrigued that no one figured that out the first time around. But then, when Alma revealed the specifics of her cat and mouse game to Reynolds himself, I was convinced that these two maladjusted individuals were simply using each other for some twisted version of a relationship that in no way could have been considered love. Like a lot of reviewers here, I can appreciate the rich period detail of the picture, and the gowns designed by the House of Woodcock were elegantly exquisite. But the principal characters were not, for as one dimensional an individual as Reynolds was, Alma proved way beyond a reasonable doubt that she was a ball buster supreme in her own way. Both the 'toast scraping' scene and that loooong pour of water meant to get on Reynolds' nerves were classic in execution. There's no denying that both Day-Lewis and Ms. Krieps were brilliant in their portrayals, though in the end, the story itself came across as rather pointless.",/review/rw4377114/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2018,siderite,8," You will either like it or hate it
","This is obviously a carefully crafted film: from the scenes, the acting, the words, the clothes, the facial and body movements, the music, it is all careful and artistic. That being said, it is terribly descriptive: an obsessive dress maker finds his muse in a strange woman who wants him to be hers alone. There is nothing else, just their play back and forth, and then the film ends. If you are here for the quality of film making, then you will probably like the film. If you want some insight into human psyche, this is a good film to learn from, with actors as dedicated as Lewis, Manville and Krieps. If you are looking for an interesting story that fills you with emotion and teaches you new things, you may be disappointed.",/review/rw4377114/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2018,TheLittleSongbird,10," A divine phantom
","Have a lot of admiration for Paul Thomas Anderson and really like to love all his work, especially 'Boogie Nights' and 'There Will Be Blood', even finding a lot to admire with his weakest film ('Inherent Vice' from personal opinion). Also consider Daniel Day-Lewis a wonderful actor and that his triple Oscar wins are testament to that. ",/review/rw4377114/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2018,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,10," A shattering glamorization of the toxicity that so many of us desire
","PHANTOM THREAD just annihilated me. It's completely worthy of all the immense hype (such as, most cinephiles considering it the best film of 2017). It grows and builds in as organic a manner that a film possibly can. At first, I wasn't sure how I felt - I needed to get to know the characters, then, through most of the movie, I was cracking up at all the tension and the misery between them, then, by the last 10 minutes, I was in tears - a flow of tears which increased each minute as I processed the power and uniqueness and realness of what I had just witnessed. They were ""profound"" tears. I don't know that I've ever seen a movie that so tastefully glamorizes the toxicity of love. The poison that so many of us romanticize, the poison that we NEED in our lives. There are two types of people in the world: people who feel at home in perfectly ""healthy"" relationships, and then there's the rest of us. This film is for the rest of us. It stands in a league of it's own. I could never have expected the conclusion - the way that the ribbon is tied, the way the final thread is sewn. It hit me like a bag of bricks. It is all of the pain in love and all of the beauty, all at once. I have never seen this story told before. It's completely original, and completely shattering. The three leads are absolutely astonishing - Daniel Day Lewis and Lesley Manville are terrifying - Vicky Krieps is the most real. The writing and directing is impeccable - P.T. Anderson's legacy continues, it's fire burning brighter than ever. Yes, this is a masterpiece. I am dead.",/review/rw4377114/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2018,cliftonofun,8," Quiet and crackling
","Quiet movies are not usually my thing. I like pace and story and energy. But this film crackles in the quiet. PTA makes every scene feel like a battle, and the actors' performances rise to that challenge. It may be a quiet movie about a dress maker, but it is so much more - a battle of wills, a tension against each seam, a few characters slowly resigning themselves to something other than what they planned. If you described the plot, I would be like, ""Really? That is the story?"" After watching it, I can say it is not just a story...it is a great story.",/review/rw4377114/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2018,evanston_dad,10," Decadently Weird Love Story
","Paul Thomas Anderson started his career by making weird hot messes of movies (""Boogie Nights,"" ""Magnolia"") that I absolutely adored. Then he moved into a phase of making weird character studies (""There Will Be Blood"") that I also adored. Then he started making weird unpleasant movies that almost challenged their audiences to enjoy them (""The Master,"" ""Inherent Vice"") that I pretty much hated. His latest, ""Phantom Thread,"" brings back the PTA that I know and love, and while definitely weird, is one of the most fascinatingly weird love stories I've ever seen.",/review/rw4377114/?ref_=tt_urv

","Since this is a Day-Lewis/Thomas Anderson project, it was bound to be labelled as an ""elegant masterpiece"".

15 October 2019,blanche-2,6," Daniel Day-Lewis' final film
","If I were Daniel Day-Lewis, and I'm not, this would not be my farewell film. It is evident that he was intrigued by the character of Reynolds Woodcock, a dedicated fashion designer, seemingly devoid of any emotion except missing his dead mother. Woodcock lives a rigid, quiet life with his sister/major domo Cyril (Leslie Manville) who couldn't crack a smile if her life depended on it. He takes on young women as lovers and models, and out they go when he's through",/review/rw4377114/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2017,Wesley-Wang,10," Elegantly Crafted Masterpiece
","Intimate, delicate, and a beautifully crafted masterpiece. Paul Thomas Anderson manages to expresses an artist's creative journey through threads of fashion and romance with such subtlety that it could only be conveyed through the medium of film. An atmosphere reminiscent of Kubrick's achievements, this romantic odyssey illustrates a unique perspective of love; a perspective in which love is shaped and manipulated by the fragile strings of each character's hearts.

13 February 2018,Fella_shibby,8," A slow n non erotic version of Bitter moon with an awesome performance by Day Lewis.
","Saw this in a theatre. Movie aint that good but Daniel Day-Lewis' acting was phenomenal.
He superbly potrayed the character of Reynolds Woodcock, who is obsessed with order, symmetry n following an organised routine. DDLs mannerisms, facial expressions n costumes were spot on. Many may hate the characters controlled behaviour but Woodcocks breakfast time was superb n so was his appetite. The film does hav repetitive trope of breakfasts for foodies.
Also noteworthy is costume designer Mark Bridges incredible work, the look of Woodcocks suits n the gorgeous female dresses added a charm.
Another aspect one cannot ignore is the mesmerizing musical score.",/review/rw4377114/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2018,Kirpianuscus,," expected one
","One of films who you expect. for elegancy, delicate humour, bitter dramatism. for sophisticated beauty. for the sensation of trip in a special side of past. for the status of artistic last will of Daniel Day-Lewis and expression of the art of Paul Thomas Anderson. and for the solide balance made by the performances of Vicky 
 Krieps and Lesley Manville.a film about fashion world. at the first sigh. because it is a film abbout a man and his circles . about passion and love and decisions and refuges, frustrations and romanticism in a special form. a film about life. so soft and subtle and charming and precise. than it gives to viewer one of rare states of pure admiration. for me, it is the expected film from many years. because it is not only beautiful of brilliant example of craft. but a sort of cure against traits of near every day reality.",/review/rw4377114/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2018,george.schmidt,8," D-Day's swan song is to be seen
","PHANTOM THREAD (2017) *** Daniel Day-Lewis, Vicky Krieps, Lesley Manville. Filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson's final collaboration with D-Day (after the latter announced his 'retirement' in the midst of production) continues to be a DynamicDuo in portraits of egotistical men with a gift for one thing in their life - i.e. a world-renowned fashion designer - while being faulted for every thing else - to wit: his Svengali-like relationship with a common young, woman (newcomer Krieps) who becomes enigmatic of their entire being. Beautifully shot by Anderson, impeccable production design by Mark Tildseley and amazing costumes by Mark Bridges give a sheen to this oddly conceived portrait of a crazed genius.",/review/rw4377114/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2018,MOscarbradley,10," A masterpiece
","Short bursts of enthusiasm on Facebook aren't enough, I fear, for most people. I've seen ""Phantom Thread"" twice now within a few weeks and I stand by my claim that it's a masterpiece. Why? Well, it's a Paul Thomas Anderson film but that, in itself, means nothing. Despite my reverance for Anderson, (let's just say ""Boogie Nights"", ""Magnolia"" and ""The Master""), even the greatest of film-makers can fall flat, (Hitchcock on a couple of occasions, Antonioni with ""The Red Desert""), but this extraordinary film seems to me to be perfection. Indeed, there wasn't a frame that didn't excite me, a line of dialogue that didn't thrill me, a performance less than brilliant, (and I am speaking of the smallest of parts as well as of the three principles). Five minutes in and I knew I was watching something really special.",/review/rw4377114/?ref_=tt_urv

","I cannot, with good conscience, recommend this film to typical Americans, but will say, it would be worth it if you gave it a chance.
Because the nuance will fall on folks who want to be relieved of their lives. This film is about the social elite and their issues when it comes to a consumed artist. Most people who have made art as a profession will understand completely. The story is of a man who excelled at his craft and is forced to see the human in rough sketched lines. Does that sound interesting to people who've just stepped out of ""Jumanji""? Nope. But it is high art.
This film is artwork come to life which will fall on deaf ears of the general public who want a more visceral experience. This is atmosphere and mood. The details are exquisite and beautiful. Again, if your meals require you yell through a drive-thru squaw box, don't see this.",/review/rw4377114/?ref_=tt_urv
