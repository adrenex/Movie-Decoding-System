26 May 2012,hall895,7," Better than some people think
","Matthew Goode thinks Leap Year is a terrible movie. What's odd about that is Goode is one of the stars of the movie. What's even more odd is that it is not at all a terrible movie. Yes, it is very predictable and formulaic. But sometimes you have to remember that in life there are established formulas because those formulas work. And Leap Year, for what it is intended to be, works. No, it is not by any means a serious motion picture. But not every movie is meant to be The Godfather. There's plenty of room in the world for a light, breezy, enjoyable romantic comedy. And Leap Year fits the bill.",/review/rw3226133/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2010,claudio_carvalho,8," Always Kiss Like It Is the First Time and the Last Time
","The uptight stager Anna Brady (Amy Adams) from Boston is a planner that stages apartments for Realtors. Anna has been dating the cardiologist Jeremy (Adam Scott) for four years and they are buying a high standard apartment in Davenport together. Anna expects Jeremy to propose her in a dinner but he gives a pair of rings to her instead and travels to Dublin for a congress. Anna decides to meet him in Dublin on the February 29th and propose him in accordance with an old Irish folklore tradition from the Fifth Century of leap-year proposals by women. However, her airplane is forced to land in Wales due to bad weather and she is not able to find a connection since the Dublin airport is closed. She decides to travel in a supply vessel but she is forced to disembark in Dingle due to a storm. Anna walks to the only restaurant and inn of the area and she hires the cynical and sarcastic owner Declan (Matthew Goode) to drive her to Dublin. Declan accepts to drive her since he needs money to quit his debts and along their journey they have many incidents. But they fall in love for each other but when they finally arrive in Dublin, Jeremy proposes Anna.",/review/rw3226133/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2010,someofusarebrave,10," See this movie
","I loved this movie. It was the best romantic comedy I've seen all year, super sweet, with the right amount of sexual tension to keep the audience pegged to the screen without relying on sex to carry the thing through. First comedy I've seen in a long while that didn't somehow contrive to get the characters into bed with one another in order to further the plot along or convince the audience that they did in fact ""love"" each other. Great tale of two people who fall madly in love as one rediscovers her heritage, and one rediscovers his heart. This is the way movies should be made. Watch this movie. Well worth the watching.",/review/rw3226133/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2010,MovieZoo,7," Leap Year: nice romantic comedy
","Anna (Amy Adams) - busy, dedicated, talented, goal oriented with one track mind on life matters. Has ""what she wants and not what she needs"".",/review/rw3226133/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2021,glgabrielsen,7," This is a good romantic comedy!
","I'm a gruff kind of guy who finds romantic comedies formulaic and cheesy. I never sort of watched Pretty Woman, for goodness sake. And I'm sure the Irish hate it for all the oirishness. But as a romantic comedy, and that is what this is - not an unforgettable, epic movie, but a romantic comedy - it's pretty fine! Left me with a nice feel afterwards, I wasn't even a wee bit annoyed over inconsistencies and stereotypical characters!",/review/rw3226133/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2010,StarDragyn,9," Most fun I've had at a theater in quite a while
","I just got back from the theater under an hour ago, and am still in a good mood after having watched this. Some romantic comedies are more comedy than romance, or more romance than comedy, but this one blends the two into something especially delightful. I left the theater with more of a bounce in my step and a wide smile on my face, despite having had a not so great day.",/review/rw3226133/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2010,Gordon-11,," A beautiful romantic comedy
","This film is about an American woman who decides to fly to Ireland to surprise her boyfriend, and to propose to him because an Irish tradition allows it.",/review/rw3226133/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,chexsmate,8," A favorite!
","I've seen this movie multiple times over the years and just watched it again. Amy Adams carries the movie, she's a fantastic actress and Matthew Goode was still good looking in this movie. I have to admit watching her doing that much walking on Ireland's country roads made my feet hurt! The scenery is stunning!",/review/rw3226133/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2010,barbicane3333,10," An absolute delight
","I saw Leap Year today. Matthew Goode has been a favorite of mine since his performance in Chasing Liberty with Mandy Moore. Amy Adams was new to me. Both leads were outstanding in this film. I am 58 and single, an old softy who always looks for a good ""chick flick"" and this one is a beaut. I don't want to give away anything. Just see it. You will love the interplay between Amy and Matthew. Theirs is a very sweet romance that builds ever so slowly. For laughs, there are pratfalls and other silliness (that's a good thing). The supporting characters are also funny and charming. The Irish countryside is gorgeous. On the way out, I heard a man behind me tell his wife ""That was a good movie. I'd see it again."" So would I. Definitely!",/review/rw3226133/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2015,heartcore9,9," Fun, sweet romance w/two great actors
","This is a sweet, funny romantic comedy. It's silly at times. However, what's silly about it is the situations and some of the plot points. On the flip side, the actors are great dramatic actors and the dialogue isn't over the top silly, so the performances and moments between the two main characters bring it down to earth.",/review/rw3226133/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2015,A_Different_Drummer,8," sublime rom-com - VERY under-rated
","Sometimes after seeing (and enjoying) a particular film several times over a period of years -- which BTW is the real acid test of a film, ie, whether it holds up -- you revisit the IMDb database and discover that, for whatever reason, the critics of the day did not agree.",/review/rw3226133/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2011,Mag-13,10," Hey folks, it's a date movie.

27 June 2010,modland,10," Delightfully innocent and sweet
","I absolutely adored this movie. So much so that I watched it 6 times within one week. Not because it's anything amazing or Oscar-worthy. Don't expect anything completely awe- inspiring, complex, or brilliant. It's just a simple love story. And what I really appreciate about this movie is how innocent and lighthearted it is. Kind of a breath of fresh, romantic air. Adams and Goode have amazing chemistry and perform their personalities to a T. It was really fun to watch the steady but stubborn transformation of their relationship throughout the movie. If you're a little bored by the acting in the very beginning, don't give up on it... It gets better! And it's even better the second time around.",/review/rw3226133/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2021,salonzoperez,10," My fave romcom ever
","What I love about this film is how it portrayed a classic romcom with strangers involved in a hateful relationship but eventually fall for each other in a very cute cute way breaking myths and legends. Plus, it's wholesomeness invites audience from all ages. Such a feel good movie! This will also make you go out there and enjoy falling in love unexpectedly!",/review/rw3226133/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2019,deborahlacekelly,8," Get over the negative reviews
","Get over the negative reviews. This is a lovely film, sweet, with charming characters and a lovely setting. If you believe in the power of romance it may even make tears well up in your eyes. Not meant to change the world just meant to be a fun film. Louis, as in Louis Vuitton the suitcase, is one of the best characters right to the end of the film!",/review/rw3226133/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2019,hnhoran,9," I'll watch it again and again!!!
","You know those nights where you want to watch a movie, but a movie that you're familiar with? The kind where you can snuggle up and be sucked into the lives of the characters you've watched over and over and never get tired of? Leap Year's that kind of movie. If I need something comforting and familiar, I know I can put on Leap Year and I'll still laugh like it's my first time seeing it.",/review/rw3226133/?ref_=tt_urv

9 May 2010,Pumpkin_Man,10," An Awesome Romantic Comedy!!!
","I gave this to my mom as a Mother's Day present, and she was very happy with it. This is a great film, with a great message. Amy Adams stars as a woman named Anna who has been in a relationship with Jeremy for 4 years, and is ready for him to pop the question. She soon travels to Dublin, Ireland to propose to him because according to Irish tradition, a woman can propose to a man on February 29th during a leap year. Because of a storm, Anna must land in Wales. She hires an innkeeper named Declan to drive her to Dublin. They don't get along too well, but they slowly begin to fall in love. If you love comedies and love stories, you'll love LEAP YEAR!!!",/review/rw3226133/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2019,Before2020,10," When movies were still good
","One of the sweetest romantic comedies of all time. In a world where we only have the choice of superheroes or nauseating dramas, I really miss this type of innocent love story. This movie takes your mind to a different place, a better place. I love everything about it and so does Louie :)",/review/rw3226133/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2010,TxMike,," Mostly a silly romantic comedy but with a good message about life in the end.
","Amy Adams is Anna Brady, ultra organized, to a fault, where she wants everything important in her life to happen according to a plan. But when she ends up temporarily stranded in a small sea village in Ireland, she eventually learns to loosen up and live life the way it is meant to be experienced.",/review/rw3226133/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2010,ferguson-6,3," Aorta not make movies like this
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Anand Tucker has a couple of nice films on his resume - ""Shopgirl"" and ""Hilary and Jackie"". What attracted him to this lame project is beyond me. The best thing I can say about this film is that the preview is actually more complex than the film ... it at least left you with small hope that maybe it wouldn't be as predictable as it appeared.",/review/rw3226133/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2010,kevncarlin,8," Romantic Comedy in the Classic Mold
","It has been years since my wife and I have seen a new romantic comedy that did not offend or annoy us with some element or another. Even our favorite current director in the genre, Richard Curtis, slips in a bit of unnecessary Chaucerian vulgarity. At his best, it redeems itself, but it seems a fixation (artistic or commercial, I wonder?).",/review/rw3226133/?ref_=tt_urv

24 April 2015,anaconda-40658,3," Leap Past This Film and See a Better One
","Leap Year (2010): Dir: Anand Tucker / Cast: Amy Adams, Matthew Goode, Adam Scott, John Lithgow, Kaitlin Olson: Boring romantic comedy about pursuing goals. Amy Adams stars as a woman so desperate for marriage that she treks to Dublin to propose to her career oriented boyfriend. Along the way she is assisted by a cynical inn keeper but any moron can see that these two will bicker but eventually fall in love. Despite the ""leap"" in the title, the screenwriter certainly makes no attempt to ""leap"" above the clichés. Director Anand Tucker delivers great Irish photography but the screenplay plays viewers for idiots. Adams and Matthew Goode run around across country while viewers await their arrival at the end credits. Adams is capable of charm and wit but here the screenplay jerks viewers around with a witless scene around a table where everybody shares a kiss. Adams and Goode refuse then give in before the meaningful smooch takes place. Goode is capable of humour but stuck in a road trip that he really isn't needed on and it feels like viewers are being further jerked around. Adam Scott plays the tight ass boyfriend who shows more interest in personal status than Adams. After appearing in this film, his status will need major repair. How unfortunate that John Lithgow is wasted in one pitiful scene as her father. He joins her at a bar, says a few comic lines then is gone from memory. There is no real point to this garbage other than to tease viewers with sappy pitiful romance. This film is more corny than romantic, and its stupid situations may leave viewers leaping from their seats in the direction of the nearest exit. Score: 3 / 10",/review/rw3226133/?ref_=tt_urv
