27 November 2018,jamielireyn,2," Show that could have been good --if not for the insufferable main character
","I tried with this show. I wanted a female based drama. I short-lived quit the show twice in season two be use Mary Jane was--and is--insufferable, but gave it another try.",/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2015,MeMeTellem,5," It Had A Good Start.
","Season one, Mary Jane was likable. Sure, she had an affair with a married man but she didn't know he was married until she stepped on his ring. After the fact, she made some clueless decisions but her character was still likable. Then towards the last two or three episodes, the series got a little ridiculous. Mary Jane's character had gone from this strong, independent, love crazy, indecisive, intelligent woman to a teenager who's boy crazy and who's best friend is egging this on. This show isn't the only show to have a few hiccups so on to season two. Season two doesn't seem to have much of a story line. Mary Jane can't decide whether or not if she wants David and every time she gets him right where she wants him, she decides she can't do this anymore. The ""this"" she caused. The whole season was this long drawn out drama of Mary Jane taking shots for a news report, doing her job as a host and as a family member, wanting not wanting David, telling people off, and nagging. Her character came very close to being unlikable. Mary Jane expected her friend to put her job on the line to save her...the same friend that chose her career over her marriage. It was proved in season one that her friend loved her career the most. So what makes Mary Jane actually think she was going to do that? Mary Jane also hangs the phone up in peoples faces when they don't give her the answer she was looking for. She also told a lot of her family members what they should be doing with their lives. There was no update of the married man and his wife. So, i'm guessing they just moved on with their lives. Gabrielle Union is a good actress and for her sake I hope this show improves. However, at this rate it would be lucky to see a season 4.",/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv

",You can stop watching after season 4. She show gets messy and repetitive. I was upset when I heard this show was ending until I watched season 5.,/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2014,Tactrix,6," Mediocre at best
","Let me start by saying that I hate that they keep casting Gabrielle Union in these clich√© weak woman roles. She's a much better actress then that and to keep putting her in things where she's always having to be the beta and crushed by the far dumber male counterparts is just wrong! That is the main problem with this show, it could have been an amazing show if everyone acted like they weren't 13 and didn't make the kind of mistakes you expect to see in high school. Instead you have a show that was essentially made with teenage drama in mind for grown adults in their 30's-40s and it simply doesn't work. I've seen these actors in all kinds of different settings and they are really good so to see them in a show this poorly written is just soul crushing. 6/10 only because despite the writers attempts to make this mindless dribble good actors are still good actors.",/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2019,edgill-79430,1," Became pathetic
","This show started with promise but was soon twisted into a predictable and sad shell of its overall potential. The strong, intelligent, confident lead became the victim of society even as she becomes the star.......Sad.",/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2013,Teyanwilson,10," I loved the show! Something refreshing!!
","I loved the show!! I thought it depicted Black women family life and work life and sex life very well. Yes we try to keep everything together thats what makes Mary Jane so normal. And the above comments about no good black men being depicted. I saw her father as a loving, caring husband who instead of seeing his wife suffer by a disease he would rather her be in peace. If you have ever truly loved someone you understood his point and that is why Mary Jane is searching for love like that. Now the next good depiction of black men was the gay bi racial couple Mary Jane best friend and co anchor. He was successful and obviously happy and living his life. This show showed to me what is and can be attained. She may have sacrificed love and kids but she has everything else together. I mean as the show goes on you will see her evolve and add the other things she craved and wanted. Every woman has had a vulnerable side and done foolish things no one to judge but to put that and show it on display shows that yes we have flaws but its a working progress. This show shows every aspect of black woman from vulnerability, to strong. You cant find that on TV anywhere now . A black woman showed in a positive light without fighting and cursing. This show was brilliant and Gabrielle Union was made to be Mary Jane. Mara Brock Akil has brought back something that was missed since Girlfriends!",/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2015,abanat1,2," 1 Season was good but now its become so boring
",First Season was exciting. Also because Omari Hardwick playing Andre Daniels. I am a man and i like his acting. Mary Jane is becoming a soap and its become too depressing. Fist season brought excitement and spice. But second season is pale and stretchy.. Simply i was a fan of this show but i stopped watching after four episodes of 2nd season. 1 Season was good but now its become so boring... What i would like to suggest is stop moping around. It looks like a rich black women who has emotional issues and she cant deal with it. While rest of world dies from poverty. And Mary has so many problems than she has to cry and mope all the time. Her life is horrible compare to ours.,/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2014,TLuks005,4," Fell Short and Flat
","The best compliment I could give this show is the soundtrack. I found myself singing along and bobbing my head throughout the premier. Other than that, the show falls flat. This is a pity considering it is exciting to see the diversification of lead characters on television, whichever form that may come. The script is flat and uneventful. The plot development is slow and uninspiring. The acting is shockingly flat considering how much overacting is happening on the show. ",/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2014,hardinjudy,1," I think the Being Mary Jane is Terrible
","I watched the first episode of the show and found it pretty good. As time went on and the series began, the show was terrible! The only reason there are viewers is the married man, single woman scenes. If you take out the scenes of Mary Jane's love interest you have nothing. The show is boring and Gabrielle Union, in my opinion, is not good at serious acting. I found her acting to be very delightful in comedies. She is very good in comedy films but very bad in drama. I cannot think of one film or series that she has been in and played a dramatic role, and that film or series succeeded. Like I said, the only reason this series is still being aired is due to the steamy scenes....remove them and the series is dead.",/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2014,filmaholic33,10," All hail Gabrielle
","I am constantly scouting for new shows and I just happened across this today. I had no idea the pilot had already come out so it was a welcome surprise. One word...Fantastic. For a pilot I found myself really engaged and at the end I wanted more, which is always a good sign for a new show, so fingers crossed the show will build up on its potential.",/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2014,alf_wes,5," Flatline......
","The 2 hour movie premiere left you wanting more...an affair, dying mom, slack family, addict brother, teenage mother to be which is Mary Jane's (niece). I actually liked the original name for the show ""Single Black Female"" because I don't know one, not one African American female name Mary Jane. They could have given her a more urban name. But anyway.... The most exciting thing about the show is Gabrielle Union's affair with a married man. Every single episode has a sex scene....yep Gabrielle Union shows some skin ( well as much as cable TV will allow). Scenes of oral sex being giving or received as well. Besides Mary Jane's ongoing affair the show is a SNOOZE! Her job and the stories she covers is a bore. The family serves mild drama but not enough to keep you entertained. Veeerrrrrrryyyyyyyy slow plot building. They never really show her interacting outside of work so we really don't get to know Mary Jane, unless she's at work or on her back. I will continue to watch and support because for the first time in a long we (African Americans) are starring in shows on cable and Basic prime time TV. Hopefully it picks up the pace.",/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2013,Kml37,2," So Disappointed
","This show was so disappointing on so many levels: Jumping out of your car to confess to someone that you are sleeping with their spouse, REALLY. Who does that! Then the scene were the Dad says he wishes the mother would DIE. How is the daughter (Mary Jane) suppose to react to that? Where are the STRONG MALE figures along with an accomplished WOMAN? You don't have to sacrifice one for the other, they can co- exist together. It seemed like most of the men in the show were cheating or addicted to drugs, or weak or lazy and unemployed or just after one thing... Sex. Now this portrayal of our black men was the most disappointing aspect of the show to me. Life is real and we humans can make some bad choices that reap some bad results, but let's have episodes that try to bring some positive resolve to the issues of life that Mary Jane and the other cast members face. If the Black Male cannot be uplifted in a show that is written by a black woman SHAME ON US!!!",/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2015,cddgmm,2," Bright & Beautiful female who appears to be very broken....or maybe a master game player....
","I think she is an amazing actress....having said that....and I know it is the script and the role she is playing....but she is NOT a sympathetic character to me.....she messes with the men in her life....she plays games...one minute taunting them.....and one minute pushing them away....all the time with NO regard for the feelings of the other women in their life....sorry.....but to me....she is a game player....maybe they are as well....but would like to see her be ""higher""....to rise above and act with some integrity...and that ""ain't happening""....not to mention....killing her fish....how sick is that....sorry.... her game playing ....well, I just lost interest....will not be watching any more episodes.....so long Mary Jane....",/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2013,dninc79,5," Great show.. need a better location, got sleepy at times.
","Show was great thanks ONLY to Ms Union's acting, she saved the entire show, i only stuck around to see what she'll do next. The dialog was exhausting, i nearly fell asleep on some parts, but they slipped a few good parts in to keep me locked in every now and then.. As far as the area this all took place, i cannot remember a thing, it was a boring, sleepy, faceless town which all of Atlanta is since all they got is an Aquarium, Coca Cola museum and CNN to look at, everything looked to put together for my taste like the entire city is a fake stage set or something i don't know..",/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,jasmaiden,6," Mildly realistic but also a mini train wreck
","I watched the show to the end of season four but it did not stop being insufferable. I can appreciate that it shows mistakes and day to day realities that don't always have happy endings but this pushes the envelope. The only normalcy featured are her parents. Nicey is draining and just seems to be a glutton of punishment and Mary Jane continuously fumbles the ball when she could actually get the happiness she claims to want. And the way she was gung ho to knock her ""idol"" Ronda off air but kept rolling over and getting kicked out of her own office to beat the pavement for a story all because Justin told her so was embarrassing.",/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2014,glammab63,1," Turned after first 15 minutes (CONTAINS SPOILER)
","Thought the acting was horrible, the opening scene was almost laughable. Couldn't stomach much else after he was being hosed down. The acting was way over the top with different actors and the same old same old script. Gabrielle can do so much better and if it were on another station and not BET, it would probably be canceled after last nights showing. Some of these shows have such horrible, melodramatic acting that I don't waste my time to watch many of them. And this one, like some of the others on the air, makes you wonder if these African Americans are just taking any role thrown at them. Was this a play before turning it into a movie? It had that feel IMO.",/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2014,mytory123,1," Disgusting Image for young black women
","I am a young black woman. 24 years old with one child and I am pregnant with my second boy. I am married and I am thankful for my family and my awesome husband whom I love and fight for everyday. I work very hard for my family and for my children and I fight with God behind me. I am a mother, a wife, I work full time and I am trying to open my first business (a group home supporting other young women). I respect the idea of Mary Jane being a business focused women. But I do not respect the fact that BET makes it look okay for one black women to take what another black woman worked for. I work hard for my family everyday and I adore and love my family. Sometimes there are good days and sometimes there are bad days. But it is not okay for a woman to come in and take another woman's hard work because the truth is, she is lonely. As black women there needs to be an image of supporting one another and strength. Not tearing one another down for our own selfish desires. I have always enjoyed Gabrielle Unions strength in her movies but in this show she sold out. She sold out her strong image and her morals and she sold out the women who do not take but work really hard for what they really want in life. I tell you what, those girls who think it's okay to sleep with a married man is going to run into the wrong wife one day... then it won't be as entertaining. I just want our black women to honor one another because it seems like now on every program and TV show black women are either fighting or sleeping around or calling one another names... And I am 24 years old, this is my generation and it hurts to see them failing. Gabrielle Union chose to give the same image as most of the reality shows for a quick dollar. So, for those who are against this, don't become angry but continue to fight for the health of our women because young women (my generation) needs it more than ever right now. I remember when there was the Cosby's and Fresh Prince of Bel Air.... good shows.",/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2015,pdtp911,7," Extremely honest portrayal of being human
","Mary Jane reminds me of all the people I have been at different times of my life, and how thankful I am that I have grown out of many of them. For those who believe that money and fame are the keys to happiness, ""Being Mary Jane"" reminds us that true happiness and grinding discontent come from what we believe about ourselves. When Mary Jane feels good about herself, she is a wonderful friend, a generous sister, a caring aunt and an attentive daughter who is able to be honest with herself about what she wants. When she hates herself, she is a coward in her relationships, the self-righteous family authority on what is correct, and downright, self-destructive. Sometimes I love her, and sometimes, because she reminds me of who I have been, I'm not fond of her. This show says so many things that others fail to say. I find it extremely brave.",/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2013,lildevil561,6," Not that bad
","(Disclaimer: This review is being given only on the basis of the premiere episode.) Let it be said, I'm actually highly disappointed in the reviews written before me. The show is obviously written to relate to the ""independent black woman"" notorious in this day and age (It premiered directly after Black Girls Rock...Come on...). The woman who suffers supporting an ungrateful and continuously using family, and having to maintain that structure simply on the excuse that ""they're family"" and that's that. The woman who suffers guilt for speaking the truth to said family when they refuse to learn past lessons and must continue to turn to her for help. The same woman who is punished with the difficulty of finding an equal (and monotonous!) counterpart to match her success and goals, simply because she has already shown productivity and achievement and there is very little to match. A woman who is judged by her own race for maintaining her pride and not demeaning herself to settle with those who don't show her the simple act of respect she deserves simply to give the falsely imagined persona of ""Black Love.""",/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2015,melissajohnson-81846,1," Why is it...
","Black women are portrayed as victims and weak? Is this really the 'message' you want to send to young black girls? (really) I watched about 5 episodes of season 1...and could NOT get through the rest. The main character, Kara, is terrible...she is supposedly a professional, successful woman(I don't believe she got her job), but she's dumb, terribly dumb...and so desperate. When the two black women started being desperate over the husband (who's a loser by any normal woman's standard). This is when I stopped watching. I get it, this is supposed to be about a black woman's journey...and I just find it disturbing that ANY attractive, successful woman would behave as these women do (I know they do, and its pathetic). Past low class. And this message of all the good guys are taken is pure bullshit (and if its the black men--dump them! and try another color...that's what I'd like to see a black woman with a white man), and lets have sex like men do...because that makes it better? No it doesn't...it makes you a whore (with a lot of baby daddies). IDK...I found it pathetic, the way black women are portrayed on this program, maybe it holds truth...IDK, but all you're doing is perpetuating the behavior and stereo-type of black women being incredibly stupid and desperate...likes she's not good enough to get her own guy, she blew off the only good one who was attracted to her(just dumb) Is this really the standard you want young black girls to live up to? I found the program unbelievable...and the characters irritating to watch. Perpetuating acceptance of stereo-type that black women are stupid and desperate, black men expect to have sex with as many women as they can, with the women accepting it. Basically complete losers, yet acceptable and condoned behavior(LOL)...and did I say incredibly desperate, stupid black women?",/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2021,devonmmunn,8," A Solid Character Study
","Just finished this show. While it wasn't the greatest show I have ever seen it was a pretty solid drama with a flawed, complex lead character. I can see that the main character is polarizing, not everyone will like her but I thought she was good character wise and Gabrielle Union gave a good performance as the titular lead. I would recommend this show just be prepared to deal with a main character who you might get annoyed with.",/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2013,meebchelle,3," Disappointing
","I guess I just expected more from Gabrielle Union. The first reviewer said it best. Why were there no good men in this movie, why were all but maybe 2 African Americans depicted as bad in this movie. When is it EVER good to portray an adulterous affair as okay. We need good female black role models for our young ladies, this movie (storyline) in my opinion, not a good idea. I was so excited about this movie and the stars in it, finally Gabrielle Union was back on TV. I only hope that future shows portray men who actually work, & love their wives and family. And if this show is scheduled as a series please don't force us to watch Mary Jane sleep her way through married men. Please give us a strong black woman to model our lives after. With the right script these stars have the ability to command our attention with a weekly series. I look forward to seeing the direction this show will go in",/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2017,jenniferjen-72023,," very disrespectful !! too much explicit sex scenes
","There are various ways to represent a strong successful black woman who are challenged consistently in the workforce. Mary Jane is rude, conceited, too prideful, and promiscuous. The majority of the show is about sex. My children are not allow to watch it due to inappropriate behavior. I was so excited that we had a black show that I can support, however, it is difficult to do just that. We can enjoy sex without looking like a whore. She enjoy revealing her body parts to various men. That is not who we are. She should have more respect for her husband it is somewhat embarrassing. Money is not everything and there are a lot of black women who are respectful, strong,have ethics. We are successful,confident, committed to our career, husband, children etc. She seem depress, unappreciated, pathetic, selfish,and of course lonely that she will take advantage of anyone regardless of the consequences. What about sexual transmitted diseases? What are you saying to out young black women? Please consider these things.",/review/rw2988751/?ref_=tt_urv

","Love love love this! And so excited for the series to begin. Gabrielle Union was flawless, charming, funny, beautiful, sexy, and straight up real! Within the first 5 minutes I was hooked. I loved that it was easy to connect with her character because her life was depicted so raw, relatable, and humble. There wasn't too much dialogue with Mary. I was one with Mary Jane, her silence at times allowed you to feel her thoughts and emotion. It was produced perfectly. This show deserves the support and I'm disappointed in the low rating reviews so far, come on people?! This is Black TV and TV that anyone can enjoy!
