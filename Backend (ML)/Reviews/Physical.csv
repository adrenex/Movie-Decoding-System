30 August 2011,Bloodwank,9," A really excellent, somewhat disturbing study in family dysfunction
","Its funny that the first major notice this film got was because somebody stormed out of an early screening crying misogyny. Funny because The Woman in fact is a long way away from misogyny, in fact I'd almost be inclined to call it a feminist film. Its an account of an average American family going about their business, except for the fact that the father is a complete monster who one day brings home a feral woman from the woods, who he decides to educate. From the very start this is unusual stuff, with the titular woman hallucinating birth then slaughtering a wolf for food, and while not especially violent given its reputation some pretty heavy territory gets explored, domestic abuse, familial corruption and a visceral take on gender power conflict. The film is anchored in Sean Bridgers' performance as Chris Cleek, family man gone very, very wrong. He gives the character a constant menace, a smile, bright face and charming demeanour, a plastic outside so almost right, so not quite all there that it perfectly suggests his inner depravity, and in his depravity he is just as slick and even darkly humoured. The character is patriarchy at its most terrible extension, dedicated to control and dominance, assured of its utter superiority and quick to cruelty. It finds perfect match in the woman though, femininity in its most feral savagery. Pollyanna Mackintosh is wonderfully inhuman in the role, conveying sheer violent animalism through her body language and freakish guttural grunts and growling. The rest of the performances are strong stuff too, Angela Bettis as the meek wife of the piece, downtrodden to the point of barely having her own personality, Zach Rand as son Brian following in his fathers footsteps and Lauren Ashley Carter as daughter Peggy withdrawing into her own shell from the horror. Everyone gels well together, drawing the audience in so the punches hurt all the more. I won't go into too much of what occurs once the woman is imprisoned, but you can probably guess some of it, and the film does a great job in stirring up a sense of intense, boiling rage at the increasing dark events. The soundtrack is an important part of this, often using soft indie rock it works perfectly alongside the whitebread setting and in the way it underlines the travails of the children, but also makes a fine contrast to the nastier stuff. I must say there was almost nothing that I didn't care for in this one and it's by far the best US horror film I've seen in years. Lucky McKee directs with a sure hand, mixing jolting savagery with cruel, calculating drama and a few moments of affecting dreamlike melancholia, although the film does get somewhat melodramatic and the intense finale goes into feverish pulp territory slightly unsuited to the mostly just disturbing bulk of the film, things are always surely handled. Arguably the film could have rounded things out better, developing its themes into something more intellectually satisfying than simply bloody violence (though the bloody violence is pretty darned satisfying) but its a minor quibble really. 9/10, really great stuff.",/review/rw2576010/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2012,ZombiGurl,8," Disgusting, Perverse, and Thought Provoking
","The Woman- The movie opens with a seemingly happy family enjoying a backyard BBQ with some friends. But it is apparent very soon that this family has a lot of terrible secrets they are hiding. The wife seems to be walking on eggshells around her husband, the teenage daughter is having trouble at school, and the teenage son is showing signs of being a psychopath like his father. The father may seem like the picture of an upstanding citizen but is actually a wolf in sheep's clothing.",/review/rw2576010/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2011,HumanoidOfFlesh,8," Cannibalism and misogyny.
","Jack Ketchum's ""The Woman"" early scenes introduces a normal American middle class family in the Cleeks,a young successful lawyer father,his sympathetic wife and three children ranging from preschool age to mid teens attending a BBQ and enjoying life.The facade doesn't last too long, and soon enough Chris Cleek,while hunting stumbles across an escapee cannibal from ""Offspring"".He captures cannibal girl and puts her in the basement,where he tries to civilize her via torture and sexual degradation.The film becomes darker and darker as we see that Cleeks family has its own ugly secrets.Disturbing horror movie that mixes cannibalism with misogyny and dysfunctional hell.The acting is great,there are some upsetting shades of incest and plenty of nasty gore.The finale is extremely gory with plenty of blood spilled and guts eaten.Haven't read the novel yet,but its film adaptation by Lucky McKee is quite graphic.I wouldn't call it 'abhorrent',though.8 cannibals out of 10.",/review/rw2576010/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2011,jennifer-25-965231,9," Strange and unique
",I went into this movie expecting the worst but came out pleasantly surprised. With all of the controversy regarding this film when that guy walked out almost made me wonder if he was planted. I mean it really wasn't all that gory and certaining not the most disturbing movie out there.,/review/rw2576010/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2021,fluffchop,8," Uncomfortable to watch, ultimately rewarding viewing.
","The movie so brilliantly illustrates how absurd ""civilized"" society really is. The man? He's an absolute psycho. A disgusting human being so typical of ""respectable"" people. The son closely follows in daddy's footsteps. A junior psycho in the making. The Woman dispenses universal justice in spades.",/review/rw2576010/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2011,chicagopoetry,7," Different, That's For Sure
","What the film ""The Woman"" has going for it is that it's different than your average horror movie. Instead of a family being terrorized by some feral people in the woods (as in Wrong Turn or Hills Have Eyes), a man captures a wild woman and brings her home to his family, keeps her chained up in a cellar in an attempt to civilize her (as in Black Snake Moan), or so he says. We soon learn that all the females in his house are sort of prisoners at the hands of this abusive husband / father and his real intention is to have a girl toy so that he can go out and rape her at night while his wife is sleeping. Even though this implausible story moves along at a snail's pace, it's still pretty interesting simply because it's something different. The film does a good job of really making us hate the evil man, but it peters out in the revenge department, which happens during the last ten minutes, resorting to cheap gore effects. I would have liked to see the man suffer a bit more, would like to have seen the wild woman toy with him or hunt him down instead of killing him so quickly. In fact, I would have liked a different ending altogether, because even though the man is evil and all, he is after all a lawyer and is masterfully meticulous in his psychological and physical torture, so for him all of a sudden to turn into a total madman is out of character. Pollyanna McIntosh is fabulous as the wild woman and the rest of the casting is superb (the kids really look like the product of their parents). Lauren Ashley Carter does a fine job as the depressed, secretly pregnant daughter, and Angela Bettis is convincing as the flinching mother / wife so scared of her husband that she goes along with whatever he does, even something this absurd (although her sudden bout of bravery at the end is unconvincing, but that's the fault of the writing, not the acting). There is a good surprise at the end but unfortunately the timing and mood are off in my opinion, so it isn't nearly as scary as it should be. If you're a horror fan you'll want to check this out, because even if it's flawed it's at least something different and probably the beginning to some great careers.",/review/rw2576010/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2011,Boris_Day,10," A feminist horror masterpiece
","So far I haven't been that impressed with Lucky McKee's films, but with The Woman he has become a director who has found his voice. It's a singular and deeply personal vision and for the first time in a film of his, it all comes together. I still find it difficult to put my finger on what makes the film so upsetting and I will need another couple of viewings to completely get my head around it, but this is part of the film's brilliance.",/review/rw2576010/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2012,jonnytheshirt,7," Whew that woke me up
","This is not a movie for all people. Well I was a bit tired when I started watching The Woman by the end of it I was wide awake and a little bit stunned. I'd definitely place this in a genre with the french movies Irreversible and Martyrs, horror with an underlying social message. Now I'm not going to get into that here as some have given this movie 1 and I'm not saying it is an epiphany or revelation but I see a lot in this movie even including the music choice as being relevant even though some have scorned it as simply bad and inappropriate. How you interpret the characters are portrayed is up to the viewer but they are acted quite well. For me the characters were symbolic in many aspects and this is a superior Horror, and horror it is. It certainly sucked me in and entrapped me in it's story. As a horror fan the large majority are predictable twaddle with people who can't run straight without falling over and generally panicking and making very bad decisions to further the plot. There were a few moments in The Woman I was approaching the feeling of - this wouldn't happen - but the good performances, underlying fear and intentionally off hand portrayal of sociopath tendencies by male lead kept me reeled tight to the story, and a story is what it is. For me I believe I 'got' this movie and i think it was well made and memorable.",/review/rw2576010/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2011,ms_jade_li,9," Patriarchy and feminism in their extremes
","The Woman tells the tale of a feral woman who is captured by, at least on the surface, a traditional family man who is an attorney in a solo practice. As the movie proceeds, it is clear that the man's patriarchy goes way beyond, into that of a power-crazed maniac. The tension is palpable between the man and his captured trophy as her presence in the lives of the family members affects each differently. Be prepared for shocking and intense graphic violence and plot twists you would never expect. Not for the squeamish. The story is compelling and so are the characters in this study of human nature.",/review/rw2576010/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2020,nickpedersen,7," Its very sick twisted
","I am not sure if this is a dark comedy, og a thriller?
Its not a horror!
The film gets more and more sick, to a point where you have to laugh.
Its well made. The acting is okay. The music seems to be very loud compared to talking and other sounds....
I found it entertaining, and I still think about it, here two days after watching it :-)",/review/rw2576010/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2012,wolverinejmc,8," Dark, brutal, heart-breaking
","The Woman arrives on DVD and Bluray amidst almost a year of controversy and festival runs. The picture was accused of misogyny, horrific violence, and bad music. Two of these three things are true. Let's just say certain musical selections don't really make sense in a film of this subject, and the violence will surely have innocents running for the door. ""The Woman"" sports a deeply feminist view upon domestic violence and the domination of man over women in contemporary society. However the film does not focus it's killer's eyes on the disturbing, horrible men featured here. A crucial moment underlines the idea that we all have the power to change a lurid situation drastically, and if you do not seize that opportunity, you are just as guilty as an aggressor. My heart broke for all the women in this film, including the titular cannibal. They endure some of the worst male behavior ever seen in a suburban, or civilized, society and the violence that embeds the last half hour is blunt and brutal. Director Lucky McKee injects so much energy into this film, but he doesn't glorify the violence. It's the audience's choice, myself included, to crack a smile when certain characters get what's coming to them. Prepare to be made uncomfortable, disturbed, scared, and finally short of breath by The Woman.",/review/rw2576010/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2011,HorrorOverEverything,8," Very original and Very entertaining
","I went into this movie knowing absolutely nothing about it other than that it was based on a book. I was shocked by what I saw, but in a very good way. I watch a lot of horror movies, and while I do enjoy most of them, it does get rather boring watching the same ole plots get rehashed and redone. Finally we are given something new and just plain out insane.",/review/rw2576010/?ref_=tt_urv

29 August 2012,amazing_sincodek,6," Good but hollow ""men are evil"" movie written and directed by a couple of men
","The first hour is rock solid. Then it becomes too directly a movie about how men are evil and women are oppressed. Also at about the one-hour mark, it loses the subtle parody aspects. There's some brutal horror scenes at the end, but they're exactly what you were expecting from the beginning, and the effects are kind of comical and sloppy. Someone gets thrown in the air and it looks like they go into anti-gravity mode. There's also this sad indie music playing at random points throughout the film; it makes sense in the early scenes, but it feels haphazard towards the end.",/review/rw2576010/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2014,natashabowiepinky,5," Well, I won't be buying the soundtrack...
","The description may sound like this man who abducts this wild girl from a nearby forest to attempt to change her primitive behaviour, is a hero... but nothing could be further from the truth. He already beats his wife black and blue, has impregnated his oldest daughter, and encourages his mental case son to engage in psychopathic behaviour. And who knows what fate lies in store for his smallest girl. The bloke is nothing but a misogynistic lunatic, and just sees this 'savage' as someone else to control and abuse. She however, may be made of sterner stuff than his usual crowd...",/review/rw2576010/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2011,micalclark,," Mixed bag
","I don't write a lot of reviews but this film gained a lot of publicity after some guy at Sundance walked out (or got kicked out) for complaining about the violence and misogyny in it. He was probably right to walk out, but did so for all the wrong reasons. I didn't find the movie particularly violent for the horror genre. What it was lacking was better writing and character development. So adding the review to give people a better idea of what they were getting, since it's presently sitting at an 8.5 with no other reviews. ",/review/rw2576010/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2022,TheAnimalMother,7," A Wild Woman And A Modern Monster Collide
","I loved the mix of upbeat music with the downbeat story. It's sort of like great jazz on film, but here it's rock and horror. This film captures some pretty unique craziness. I enjoyed the film. If you love horror films, I'd say definitely don't miss this one!",/review/rw2576010/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2021,zhivago97,7," Engaging and suspenseful
","Not at all what I expected. It was rather intense at many different points throughout and the characters always had my full attention. A nice tight script, albeit with some lose ends that left me wondering why? But overall this is a really good film, if you don't mind some graphic scenes.",/review/rw2576010/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2019,dfranzen70,1," You have to be kidding me.
","I don't mind violent movies. I don't mind blood and gore and gratuitous torture. I can handle it, and in a few movies here and there, it helps move the plot. I also don't mind cringe-worthy movies. This one, however, fails on just about every possible count. The violence is fleeting, albeit shocking. Until it's not. The motives are unknown, until you realize they don't matter. Almost all of the blame can be laid at the feet of the director and writer (the poor actors feel like unwitting accomplices at times). In the hands of a pro behind the lens, this might have been quite the nasty piece of work, something that'd make you feel something - anger, revulsion, terror, hopefully - but instead it's all so badly paced and shot and edited and organized that you feel like you're watching a work in progress. Point in fact: we're supposed to be shocked, SHOCKED! that a prominent lawyer/family man is capable of such violence. Only this dude seems sketchy, even creepy, right away. And that's the main tenet of this movie, how a Good Family goes bad. What a load of crap. No, I didn't like this movie, no sir I did not.",/review/rw2576010/?ref_=tt_urv

","I saw this movie on a rented DVD in 2012. Well, i heard so much praise bah this film that i cudnt wait to play the DVD. One mistake i did. I saw this before its prequel ""Offsprings"". This movie started slow. Nothing happens. The capture of The Woman while she is out in the forest drinking water was silly. I thot how cn cannibals or feral clans still exist that too so close to civilization. Still i continued watching. Still nothing happens. To top it all the acting was bad, editing was lousy, music terrible n the screenplay sucked big time. Some may find it strange and aggressive. I found it boring n unexplained. The movie ended with a wild bloody finale. Gore hounds will b happy but they hav to wait till the end. Its a very slow movie. Thats it. I didn't recognise (or was aware) that the Woman was Pollyanna McIntosh. Her other two films which i enjoyed (Exam n Let us prey), i saw much later aft this flick.

","Gory in parts, but some cracking performances by the actors, and though a slightly predictable plot, it kept me at the edge of my seat nearly all the way through. A powerful performance from Pollyanna McIntosh. She stole the movie. She has just the right amount of masculine feral power mixed with feminine vulnerability to make her character truly believable and you root for her and the final denouement all the way through the film. The air of menace mixed with devastating elements of bullying and cruelty by the sadistic father and his effect on the psyches of his family are well handled and plausible.
