18 December 2013,shawneofthedead,6," An odd, fantastical twist on a true story - not as bad as you're expecting, though not as good as history would have it.
","It never bodes well for a film when its release date is delayed - much less when it's been pushed back a whole year, ostensibly to accommodate reshoots that would bump up Keanu Reeves' completely imaginary role in a Western blockbuster take on a classic, awe-inspiring tale right out of the Japanese history books. That way lies disaster and madness, one would think - and certainly the bland, monster-heavy trailers for 47 Ronin did the film no favours. Smack down your inner critic, however, and this epic fantasy flick - for that's what it is - turns out to be reasonably palatable fare.",/review/rw2954688/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2013,skot-21,8," Not nearly as bad as haters are making it out to be!
","The reviews for this film seem to be pretty negative generally speaking. Pivoting around the historical inaccuracies and the addition of the ""Half Breed"" character played by Keanu Reeves to this legendary tail. More on that further in.",/review/rw2954688/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2014,leonblackwood,7," An unexpected joy to watch! 7/10
","Review: I really enjoyed this movie. It had a very traditional Japanese movie feel and great action throughout. The storyline was well put together by the director and you can really see were there big budget went, with all of the glamorous costumes and amazing scenery. The love story was a bit cheesy, but it spoil the whole flow of the movie. I'm in two minds about Keanu Reeves though. He just seemed misplaced throughout the film and he looked like he didn't know what to do with himself. All the way through the movie, he's treated like an outcast, even though he keeps on saving there ass, and he never gets the recognition that he truly deserves. Being called a half breed through your whole life would make anyone turn against the people that you live and work for, but he is a loyal servant he shows that his skills are very much needed. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch and you can't help feeling touched by the amazing courage of the 47 Ronin. Enjoyable!",/review/rw2954688/?ref_=tt_urv

23 July 2020,joiningjt,9," Great movie has it all!!
",Although it doesn't follow the historical story of the 47 ronin I like how Hollywood imagined it. I've learned to judge a movie based on if it entertained me and this film did!! I liked the cinematography as well another feather in Reeves acting cap!! Supporting cast was excellent as well the 3d was marginal at best I'd buy the 4k and ignore the 3d version.,/review/rw2954688/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2020,masonsaul,8," Great fantasy adventure
","47 Ronin is a great fantasy adventure that emotional and thrilling. Keanu Reeves and Hiroyuki Sanada both give great performances. The music by Ilan Eshkeri is also great. It's well paced, well filmed and Carl Rinsch's direction is really good. The CG is consistently excellent. However, it's brought down by Rinko Kikuchi's extremely over the top performances which feels out of place with the rest of the film.",/review/rw2954688/?ref_=tt_urv

","47 Ronin is a highly fictionalized take on the story of the 47 ronin who took revenge on a court official who had the 47's leader commit seppuku. In the film, Keanu Reeves portrays Kai, a half-British Half-Japanese outcast who is called upon by Oishi, the leader of the 47. The 47 seek revenge on Lord Kira, who also has an evil witch (Rinko Kikuchi) serving under him, who killed their master.",/review/rw2954688/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2014,hkauteur,7," HK Auteur Review - 47 Ronin
","47 Ronin is a film reimagining of a popular Japanese folktale that is stuck inside its mythic contraptions. Everybody is an archetype, as opposed to a character. Love, hate or brotherhood between characters is assumed rather than shown through character development. The story starts and ends with an unknown narrator, who tells the story as if we were all listening to a old tale by a campfire. The end result is that it places a distance between the story and the audience. It is as if the story itself is matted on a frame, and we are just looking at it in a gallery with a curator recounting the story as opposed to the viewer experiencing the story from a first-person perspective.",/review/rw2954688/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2013,aharmas,9," Good Old Fashoned Samurai Fun
","I remember getting excited when I saw the previews for this film, and I was hoping it would be good. Lately I heard rumors that it was a bomb, that it wasn't good, and my heart sank. Guess what? It looks like the critics are looking for their ""Lone Ranger"" for the season, which only means this is a good movie that's getting an unfair bad rap. I saw it today, and the film delivered in every possible way: It's a big production, great action, good acting, and very cool special effects.",/review/rw2954688/?ref_=tt_urv

","My wife and I saw this movie panned by critics on Rotten Tomatoes, and the only conclusion we came to is they just were not sensitive to the culture of Japanese mythology. The movie was excellent. We had been dying to see it since the first announcements, and despite the critics reviews, we went. Thank goodness we did.",/review/rw2954688/?ref_=tt_urv

7 August 2019,classicsoncall,7," ""When a crime does unpunished, the world is unbalanced.""
","For a film dealing with forty seven ronin, there's very little in the way of martial arts action in the story. The problem I have is with the blind obedience the various provinces had to honor Shogun Tsunayoshi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) with. To my mind, the Asano Clan did the right thing in avenging the death of their Lord (Min Tanaka), but with one god-like authority calling the shots without question, the possibility that he might have been wrong is dealt with as a moot point. I also couldn't understand why the Nagato Witch (Rinko Kikuchi) made herself subservient to Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano). As powerful as she was in her various guises, she didn't need to go to all that trouble to get her way, she could have stepped right over Kira as need be. Though Kianu Reeves is the principal character Kai, a half-breed warrior raised by the Asano Clan, it seems at times that the real hero of the story is Hiroyuki Sanada's Oishi as point man for the Asano's. It's Oishi who rises to the occasion to put away Lord Kira, while Kai (Reeves) battles the dragon-witch in her final guise. I know the point of the story is honor and tradition, but what would have happened if all the Samurai at the end of the picture decided they weren't going to follow the Shogun's order to commit seppuku? I don't think I would have liked those odds if I was in his shoes.",/review/rw2954688/?ref_=tt_urv

","I remember a time when people would flock to the cinemas when a new Keanu Reeves movie came along, but these days he just does not seem to have the same pulling power as he did in the days of The Matrix and Point Break. I first became familiar with Reeves with the two Bill and Ted movies, which are still some of my all time favourite films, but these days, and this movie is a prime example, he seems to have just fallen flat. In a way I really wanted to like this movie, and for a while I was caught up in it, but as it moved along, and it wasn't slow by any means, my interest simply began to wane.",/review/rw2954688/?ref_=tt_urv
