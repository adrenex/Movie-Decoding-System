",The Apology is a dark thriller just released on Shudder starring Anna Gunn & Linus Roache. It has a promising opening and a good tense 30 minutes but ultimately loses itself in the third act.,/review/rw8753304/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2022,jmbovan-47-160173,3," Christmas, grief, and drama.
","This isn't a horror film. It's barely a thriller. This is a generally a two person play they decided to film. The main character is hosting family Christmas after 20 years. She also lost her daughter, 16, 20 years ago who simply disappeared. Her ex-brother-in-law arrives unexpectedly, and this starts the drama. Unfortunately, the drama is a two person morality play of contrived dialogue and weakest of characterizations. This film triggers a lurid reaction to watch to the end, but only to see if any truth is found. Along the way, information that is meant to shock us is disclosed, and secrets are shared. All leading to the ending that is supposed to build faith in humanity? What I found was grief that goes without processing leads to dissatisfied and unhappy lives. Could have done something better with the 90 minutes.",/review/rw8753304/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2022,fredrik-m-987-845353,3," The Apology (But not really)
","I was looking forward to watching a new movie with Anna Gunn as one of the main characters. I always thought she was absolutely amazing in Breaking Bad. However, there was not much she could do with this script. The movie is pretty short but it feels like it drags on for way too long. It started off pretty decent but the whole thing goes down the drain around the midway.",/review/rw8753304/?ref_=tt_urv

20 December 2022,cyclops_screener,2," Decent movie, tons of holes
",It happens with too many movies -- an interesting premise falls apart because a poor script cannot hold its weight.,/review/rw8753304/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2023,manuelasaez,2," Truly and unbearably dreadful.
","You've seen this movie done 100 times before. Mother's daughter goes missing, she spends 20 years looking for her, and someone from her past comes back to offer an apology for the things he's done. It's exactly what you expect seeing after reading that synopsis, nothing new, interesting or engaging even slightly deviating from the tired formula, and the whole ordeal came off as a more ""men are bad, and much worse than bad women/mothers"".",/review/rw8753304/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2022,zack_gideon,3," Turned it off with 20 minutes left
","I watched most of this film or at least tried to. It's an interesting premise I suppose, but it's also not in a lot of ways. The moment the guys (at the very beginning) car ""breaks down"" and she doesn't question it at all I knew the script wasn't going to be great.",/review/rw8753304/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2022,wisemanfromtowne,6," A decent and quick story of a missing person solid watch.
","After twenty years of sobriety a grieving mother finally learns the truth about what happened to her daughter who's has been missing as long as her sobriety by a very unlikely person who shows up at her home to confess to her everything that happened to her daughter. With a very small budget and cast, this was a decent and very quick story of a missing person reveal. I was actually ready to turn it off because I thought it was going no where but after the reveal of the daughter's demise, my interest piqued and I decided to stay engaged and watch to the end. A dialog film more than a visual meaning that you could easily just listen and not watch the film and still manage to follow the story without missing anything. Not sure why it fell under the genre of horror and thriller because it's neither. It's a suspense dialog in one place with a cast of three people done proper. And let me just add one more thing, some family members are absolute trash and sometimes end up being your worst enemy.",/review/rw8753304/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2022,jtindahouse,8," A perfect example of a minimal budget not being an issue whatsoever
","I find it so refreshing when a movie just wants to tell a good story. 'The Apology' is the kind of movie you can make on a minimal budget, with one setting and very few cast members, and if you do it right it can be infinitely more captivating than a $200 million budget film.",/review/rw8753304/?ref_=tt_urv

21 December 2022,nogodnomasters,4," I can fix all of this
","Darlene (Anna Gunn) is preparing on Christmas Eve to have family over for Christmas at her place. It has been 20 years since her daughter Sally has gone missing. The neighbor Gretchen ( Janeane Garofalo) is there with encouraging words. It is a dark and stormy night with snow thunder. Her sister Julie and her kids will be over. Unexpectantly Jack, Julie's ex-husband shows up at Darlene's door claiming his truck skidded. He had planned to surprise everyone at Christmas and to make peace with the family. The two of them had a fling a couple of decades ago. The conversation always leads back to Sally which turns into something nasty, like something you might see in a Farrah Fawcett/James Russo film, although not as intense and heart throbbing.",/review/rw8753304/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2022,pauljgunn-93232,2," Umm, last minute school project
","Started out ok enough. That is if you forgive the whole 'car broke down' thing. But still, we will give them the benefit of the doubt there. Was actually getting into it. Obviously there was no shock or surprise with the big reveal, I think we could see that one ambling down the road for some time. Again, forgivable, there are only so many stories out there and it soon becomes apparent that we aren't watching anything new. Still nice enough little story. But then.......one can only assume that whoever was writing this had left it until the last minute and it was due in the next day. The scrip falls apart completely with some cringe-worthy dialog (fair play - the two leads managed to deliver it without looking for the director to check it was actually correct). The introduction of the 'neighbour' character who was nonchalantly walking the dog was equally as contrived. I expect the writer had recently watched Fargo and thought - ""that was good - I'm going to do one of them"". It seems It isn't that easy though is it.",/review/rw8753304/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2022,elirose-96112,1," Don't bother
",The movie had so so much potential. It had a good plot and really started off amazing. The whole plot of the movie is this woman's missing daughter. Missing is the key word here. This man comes and is telling her this whole confession and there is a lot of action and had me really going. You go through this whole movie with this lady wanting to know what happened to her daughter. Finally is getting answers and then the movie just goes to poop. Let me tell you she never finds where her kid is. Yeah she gets a confession but that's it. Never even asks where her body is. So disappointed. Just no.,/review/rw8753304/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2022,mesunsan,8," Low rate reviewers did you even watch the film?
","Yeah, the scrip had some unsurprising scenes but it was about the people and their pain not about a possible twist at the end. It's not like people don't get away with crimes for decades or even a lifetime.",/review/rw8753304/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2022,lukebknmusic,10," Solid thriller good acting
","Ignore all of the bad reviews, this movie was a good enjoyable watch. Especially this time of year, around the holidays on a cold winter night. Good thriller! I thought the acting was really good. I love Anna Gunn she's really good. The pacing is good it's not too slow, and it's easy to get in to from the start. There's a lot of dialogue between the two main character and the build of of tension is paced pretty well in my opinion. I like how Anna Guns character is a recovering alcoholic it brings a good dynamic to the story and it's something I can relate too. Over all good enjoyable movie, I give it 10 stars because I think it deserves a better rating then it has been getting from bad reviews!",/review/rw8753304/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2023,Her-Excellency,5," Somewhat of a disappointment.

23 December 2022,erkanarat,4," A huge gap between the intents and actions, and the acting capabilities of the characters
",The man has intent of confessing and apology but with a gun at his hand and appears to be not a man feeling remorse. The woman has intent of killing the man who killed her daughter but she tried to hurt him and make him confess who is there to confess the murder. The scenario is really mind-bender.,/review/rw8753304/?ref_=tt_urv
