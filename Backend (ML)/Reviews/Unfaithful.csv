5 January 2022,SnoopyStyle,6," extending the franchise
","Adela (Ana de la Reguera) and Juan (Tenoch Huerta) are a couple crossing the border illegally. The Purge has been reinstated by the new government. Dylan Tucker (Josh Lucas) is hunkering down on his Texas ranch with his family; his sister Harper (Leven Rambin), his pregnant wife Cassidy (Cassidy Freeman), and his father Caleb (Will Patton). Adela and Juan join others in renting sanctuary. They all survive the night but there are those who want to extend the Purge to an everyday reality.",/review/rw7135226/?ref_=tt_urv

4 July 2021,movieman6-413-929510,2," Hopefully the Purge movies don't go on forever.
","The Forever Purge is the fifth film in the Purge film series. The movie is directed by Everardo Gout, this is only the first movie he has directed and before this he has only directed TV episodes of various TV series.",/review/rw7135226/?ref_=tt_urv

5 July 2021,haydenluz,3," The Forever Purge
","I didn't go into this film with high expectations, knowing the other four films to the series aren't the greatest, but The Forever Purge is a fat waste of time! The premise seemed to have promise coming in, but Everardo Gout straight up missed the mark, making the film way too political, rather than having political ties, and an interesting concept. The Forever Purge had cardboard cut outs for characters, cringey acting, a shallow script, with horrendously cheesy action sequences.",/review/rw7135226/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2021,gedikreverdi,2," 2 out of 10 only for that beautiful desert landscape that I got to see for a few seconds
","Extremely predictable with some preachy and crude political message. I never felt nervous when the Mexican woman got trapped because I knew she'd be saved. I didn't feel nervous when she got trapped at the back of the police van with a skinhead nazi because I knew she'd be saved. She got abducted by the racist white guy at the border in the desert and I didn't feel anything at all because guess what? I knew all along that she and her lover would be saved. No tension, no surprise, no killings but just b-action-movie shootings and no payoff; only horrible CGI and ridiculous dialogues. I'm officially done with anything related to Purge.",/review/rw7135226/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2021,UniqueParticle,9," Best Purge since Anarchy
","Despite controversy I loved The Forever Purge! I'm pretty sure it's the most violent installment, quite disturbing, and I absolutely love the masks/makeup. Josh Lucas did so great, refreshing to see him in a more action based roll most anything else wasn't as much. The Purge movies tend to get a lot of hate and I'd highly recommend this one! I really like the writing and producers as well.",/review/rw7135226/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2021,Praxhant,3," As a Purge Fan.... Disappointing
","Although i like the first 3 purge films and hated the first purge my expectations were not very high for this one and man the movie was Disappointing....first half was bad the second half was way to predictable like we knew that they will kill the Mexican guy who fell in love with the American guy's sister. Not only that, in climax when they are left with 0 ammunitions they all are hiding behind the bus in an completely open field and still they all were able to escape like watt!!??..Overall the movie had nothing new to offer, won't recommend it.",/review/rw7135226/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2022,zac-04879,3," Terrible
","""The Forever Purge"" would be much better as ""The Final Purge"". It would make complete sense, considering the completely irrational and senseless government of this terribly dystopian version of America could finally shut down the annual purge after the events of this disastrous film. Alike the previous Purge movies but focusing on a completely different story, this film revolves around the yearly purge. But instead of having the entire movie centred on these violent 12 hours of legal crime, it's set after the event when some mindless fools decide it's not over and never will finish.",/review/rw7135226/?ref_=tt_urv

27 October 2021,westsideschl,2," Crude Stereotyping
","Nothing creative just crude excessive stereotyping & clich√©s on human behavior. Very simplistic political categorizing. (Must be the Trump influence.) Americans are more divisive than ever & the ones with the bigger guns are on the rampage. Predictable who lives, who dies. Humorously, Mexico is now the destination for freedom. The usual cheap artificial looking evenly spaced burning cars/trash along with nicely placed bodies on the streets to denote rampaging killers.",/review/rw7135226/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2021,BandSAboutMovies,6," I liked it!
","Directed by Everardo Gout and written by series creator James DeMonaco, this is yet another example of ""the last Purge"" before they announce another sequel. That said, this series has gone from middling to decent to actual pretty good to middling all over again, so I was happy that this pushes the Purge in a new direction: once the killing starts, it won't stop. Sure, the series has gotten pretty heavy handed, but if the last few years have taught us anything, it's that the Purge is closer than ever before.",/review/rw7135226/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2021,benwelbourne,3," The Forever Problem
","The Forever Purge had potential to be an interesting addition in the purge universe but unfortunately fell flat with the disappointing plot and predicable jump scares. If this is the first Purge outing for you it won't be such a letdown, maybe wait until its on another platform instead of paying for a cinema ticket.",/review/rw7135226/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2021,Neptune165,3," Too much political crap
","I hate that it's no longer a horror franchise. I am a horror fan. All the politics seemed forced too. I only liked the first two Purge movies. I didn't care to see the rest because I lost interest and I was starting to hate the politics and the acting of the Franchise. Nothing ties this movie together. There no emotion for us to care about the actors. Complete snoozefest. The whole series is about wealth, race and social issues. Movie was too political , was expecting a purge film / thriller. They touched too much on ethnicity etc. This movie was straight up hateful propaganda and people don't even realize it. It was full of the most corny stereotypes possible. It was trash.",/review/rw7135226/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2021,necktienick,3," The weakest of the franchise
","Poor writting, mediocre direction and pretty lackluster performances attached to a film thats messages have all the subtly of a sledgehammer to the face make for a very poorly handled mess with more contrivances, coincidences and plotholes than you can count on both your hands. Add on to the fact it takes itself way too seriously. Much of the actiom is shakey cam and cuts away before you see anything too violent. The worst of a dying franchise.",/review/rw7135226/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2021,toddmichaelstarks,2," GOOD LORD THIS MOVIE SUCKED
","I wish I could write a better review, cause I fell asleep midway. Terrible. Even the action is boring. Absolutely no suspense. Didn't care for the western set up either. Oh well. If you're a true Purge fan, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. Can't beat the first Purge. That's about it. If you need a good nap.. be my guest. Actually, you might like it if you're 12.",/review/rw7135226/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2021,trinaboice,1," Boring and annoying
","IN A NUTSHELL:
Blumhouse Productions presents another sequel to the creepy franchise, this time with a western vibe. The setting and background are certainly timely as it takes a look at the flood of illegal immigrants crossing the U. S. border and the violence that has been prevalent during the pandemic. While the franchise has always felt like pure fiction, this one actually feels more realistic as we realize the unbridled anger and frustration at ""the system"" could actually look like this in the extreme. That's true horror.",/review/rw7135226/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2021,TharsheyN,8," The Forever Purge - A Great Effort!
","First off, before I even get into my
review for this movie I want to say that I am not American and therefore the politics in this film while they draw some parallels to the current situation in my country doesn't affect me as much as it seems to have affected my fellow reviewers.",/review/rw7135226/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2021,atractiveeyes,8," Very Good
","This is the best among the franchise, it's highly enjoyable and well made. The plot is so nice and tackles serious issues like racism, xenophobia and classism. The film also has some beautifully shot thrilling, brutal and action scenes.",/review/rw7135226/?ref_=tt_urv
