","This movie is derivative of several other gross-out movies about bachelor party shenanigans, full of dopey people doing gross, stupid things. Penis jokes, male strippers, guzzling booze, doing drugs, all a a feverish 'isn't this funny?? Isn't it? Isn't it??' by people really too OLD to be acting so stupid.....Hey, spring break is for the stupid YOUNGER crowd. It's all wearying and tiresome, been done to death, and frankly it's just embarrassing. (anyone remember the 'WOOOO! Girls' in the bar, in the TV show 'How I Met Your Mother'? WOOOOO!)

",I love TV show Broad City and was looking forward to this because two of the creatives behind that show paired up to give us Rough Night. The generic title (a switch from Move that Body which was much more suitable) should have warned me. Rough Night is forgettable and not really that funny. ,/review/rw5091746/?ref_=tt_urv

","If Bridesmaids (2011) was proof that the ladies can play just as rough in delivering truly inspired raunch-com moments, then Rough Night is incontrovertible proof that they can also deliver mediocre fair with the same lack of conviction as their coasting male counterparts. Is it funny; yeah in spurts. Can it be a little cloying; yeah at times. Is it the best version of what it could be? Perhaps that's the wrong question.",/review/rw5091746/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2017,tavm,7," Rough Night was funny enough as an adult comedy
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. This was quite a funny and raunchy comedy about a reunion of four female college friends with one of them about to get married. The last one mentioned has a friend from Australia also join in the fun. Then the night turns a little dark. I'll stop there and just say this was funny enough for recommendation. I also liked some of the true-life real stories mentioned to give ideas to some of the characters. So on that note, go for it if you're curious about Rough Night.",/review/rw5091746/?ref_=tt_urv

","Gawd, who is this movie written for? Is it just an automatic money making ""no-brainer"" (and I mean that literally) to have a female coterie reunite years later for alcohol, partying, clubbing, male stripper all at an exclusive vacation locale? Plot has been done too many times including guys' versions. Fifty years of progress in portraying intelligent resourceful women has been reduced and characterized to loud intoxicated ""b..hes"" trying to outdo each other in acting the stupidest. Oh, more dumbness in added subplot of some stranger dying which expands into a not believable, suppose to be funny, crime clean up mess which itself has been done too many times in film. Demi Moore makes a brief appearance and as in ""Blind"" shows little acting skill. In both films she basically just hangs on some guy and smiles.",/review/rw5091746/?ref_=tt_urv

28 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,7," Rough Night is a comedy I should not have enjoyed...but I did.
","For those of you who follow my reviews or know me personally would know that I just don't like comedies. I hardly ever laugh, find them cringeworthy and would rather watch a depressing film about a serial killer. But here we are, a film that has surprised me and made me laugh. Not once. Not twice. We're talking multiple occasions. What!? Gasp. Shock. Horror. I thought Rough Night was hilarious. I don't know if it's because I was hyper on confectionary goodness and sugary drinks but yes I enjoyed the hell out of this. We follow a group of girls who throw a bachelorette party for one of their friends. Clubs, drinking, drugs and the attempted removal of a guy they just killed. I shouldn't have liked this, reason being is that it's just another formulaic comedy where our characters relive the past only for the present to hit them in the face, they argue and make up. The end. So yes, it is formulaic. It also dragged towards the end and the laughs started to become inconsistent. But...but but but...the majority of the runtime was packed with hilarity and that's pretty much down to the script and charismatic performances. Scarlett Johansson was fantastic, I was slightly ""meh"" at the beginning but warmed to her comedic timing. Kate McKinnon though, stole the whole damn film. Her forced Australian accent just killed me. Yet again, her exaggerated acting and dialogue execution just made her hilarious. Demi Moore though...yikes! Good on her but...yikes! The scenarios that are characters are put under were varied, somewhat inventive and outrageously funny. Particularly scenes where they attempt to hide the body, who knew glasses with a phallic shaped object attached would make me laugh (immature...I know). I thought the script was pretty consistent throughout, there were times where jokes didn't always hit but for the most part I either smiled or laughed out loud. I needed to be cheered up, I needed a laugh, I needed a good time. This film did all that successfully.",/review/rw5091746/?ref_=tt_urv

",I watched this without looking at any reviews and actually really enjoyed it. It wasn't perfect but was still fun and entertaining and I did actually laugh out loud a good few times and felt good after watching it! Then I went on here to check out the reviews out of curiosity and they were terrible which would have made me not watch it!

",'ROUGH NIGHT': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) ,/review/rw5091746/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2017,dave-mcclain,7," ""Rough Night"" is creative, well-put together and, best of all, decadently and darkly diverting.
","The bachelorette party comedy ""Rough Night"" (R, 1:41) brings together an element that Movie Fans rarely find on both sides of the camera – women. Well, women in prominent roles anyway. In 1982's ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", female characters had what were (for that era) relatively empowered roles, but the movie was still mainly about guys who were either pursuing girls or hanging out with their buds. Still, ""Fast Times"" was a bawdy comedy directed by a woman (Amy Heckerling) who, in the spirit of equality, shot full frontal female AND male nudity although the latter had to be edited out in order to avoid the box office-killing ""X"" rating (eight years before NC-17 became an option). The next big step forward for women in R-rated comedies came 17 years later with the first ""American Pie"" in which the female characters were as sexually savvy and empowered as the male characters on that big screen.",/review/rw5091746/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2017,2001ASOfan,8," Fans of R-rated gross-out comedies: Rejoice!
","Stop reading right now if you find gross-out comedies repulsive and don't like legitimate, well-known actors doing disgusting things that could ruin you for seeing them in any more serious efforts in the future. I love seeing actors let their hair down and go for it in the spirit of having a good time themselves and (more importantly) making audiences laugh while doing so, and ""Rough Night"" is a very good example of exactly that. Everyone here clearly had a terrific time on set, I have no doubt some of the funniest dialogue was improvised, and that kind of free-spirited energy spills over for the benefit of any willing audience members who are there to go along for the ride and have a good time, too. Yes, the film could've used a quicker editing pace, does flag just a bit a few times, and cutting it to a 90-minute-ish running time would've likely made it an even tighter, funnier, zippier ride. But I mean to emphasize the most important thing: I laughed--a lot, and so did the audience around me. All of the main ensemble are a hoot, and one of the reasons I love this genre of comedy is discovering new talented comedians I didn't know before, usually in smaller supporting roles--here it's Paul W. Downs as a soon-to-be-married ""6"" (out of 10--the script's reasoning for his friends rating him a 6 are hilarious) who decides no one's going to stand him up at the altar. His efforts to fight back are easily one of the best running gags in the film. I'm a huge fan of Kate McKinnon's--sometimes just the way she facially reacts to other actors' lines can have me lost in belly laughs--and she's a standout here, but everyone genuinely pitches in and goes for it--and I love 'em for it! Good comedies are so rare these days, and I run to every one on opening weekend to pay to support them, hoping more will be made. Overall the mainstream multiplex movie fare leaves me wanting these days, and I hope all-out comedies, there for no other reason than to make us laugh and lighten our days, never go away.",/review/rw5091746/?ref_=tt_urv

15 June 2017,trublu215,5," A Mildly Funny Film That's Been Done Before and Better
","Let's be honest here...Rough Night is probably the most unoriginal idea to hit theaters this summer. It has the storyline of Peter Berg's 1998 film Very Bad Things with a Weekend at Bernie's twist. Starring Scarlett Johansson, Kate McKinnon and Zoe Kravitz, the film's star power seems to have no shortage but the film's screenplay doesn't know what it wants to be. There are far too few thrills to classify it a thriller and, as far comedy is concerned, it is severely lacking. So we're given this cookie-cutter film that does its job (more or less).

11 January 2019,tabuno,8," A Darker Edged Comedy
","18 June 2017. This female version of the raunchy wild night out genre offers up a lot that the typical storyline of past such movies have tread. Yet there seems to be a more nuanced emotional bonding and reflective, albeit drugged mindfulness or least an attempt at one than the completely dumb-witted male outings of other movies. The significantly higher IMDb ratings among young and older females over males might suggest either the pent up sexist lack of a predominant female presence in the immoral, debauchery of in past movies is being acknowledged or that there is an increased appreciation for how there might be a vague underlying morality that women continue to hold onto even when their mental faculties are diminished.",/review/rw5091746/?ref_=tt_urv
