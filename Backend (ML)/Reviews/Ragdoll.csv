12 March 2015,Leofwine_draca,9," Haunting and profound
","For me, this is Willem Dafoe's best film. The whole movie belongs to him: he's in virtually every scene, and the abstract, spare nature of the script allows the director to focus his camera on the star's craggy features, capturing the look and spirit of a haunted but determined man who must do the right thing despite the odds stacked against him.",/review/rw2643552/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2012,LOL101LOL,9," Bloody ripper!
","Damn it's not often I come across an Aussie film that I would recommend to some one, but this is by far the best Aussie film I have seen in a long long time. I have lived in Australia for just on 30 years, and most films and TV series are lame, boring and very forgettable, but not this gem! ",/review/rw2643552/?ref_=tt_urv

","As mentioned , this film is centered around a mercenary in search of a Tasmanian tiger which has a physiological toxin that is valued by a pharmaceutical multinational corporation, Red Leaf (Good vs. Evil) Pretty basic premise, but yet the story is well told in a subtle manner. Sam Neill and Frances O'Connor as locals in the Australian mountains and terrain. The cinematography is moving, beautiful and harsh at the same time.",/review/rw2643552/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2012,priyantha-bandara,7," The landscapes are amazingly beautiful and the story line keeps you going
",The Hunter speaks of humanity left in a cruel man who was sent on a different mission. This time he is to hunt down an endangered animal and then he comes in touch with a wonderful family with kids where he finds his softness in heart. Film rather starts and moves bit slow but it just gives the total freedom for the viewer to wonder about. The plot is unique and I'm sure I have not come across anything similar before. The landscapes are amazingly beautiful and the story line keeps you going. I like Dafoes performance on this. And the sweet little kids. ,/review/rw2643552/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2012,soncoman,8," An Intelligent Eco-Thriller with Terrific Performances
","Opening (coincidentally) during the San Francisco International Film Festival, ""The Hunter"" would fit right in among the 175 films being shown there. This Australian film, filmed mostly in Tasmania, stars the great character actor Willem Dafoe (in a rare leading role) as Martin David, the title character. David is engaged by a multinational corporation to track down the last surviving ""Tasmanian Tiger"" so that they may have exclusive rights to its DNA. David must do this under the noses of environmentalists trying to stop deforestation and the locals whose jobs and livelihoods rely on it.",/review/rw2643552/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2011,Manton29,7," An escape into beauty and danger
","An elite hunter secretly hired to locate the last Tasmanian Tiger (extinct but, in this film, recently sighted), get genetic samples for a pharmaceutical company and then destroy all traces of it. He soon runs into serious problems. The Hunter takes you into some beautiful country and has a great performance by Dafoe at its centre and while it does offer quite a few reasons to grumble, I am not. I was entertained, I 'escaped', and I was on the edge of my seat when the danger kicked in towards the end. Only after the credits did I really begin to take stock of the defects and by then it was a case of 'while I really enjoyed it, I must say that...'. Basically, some of the characters and their motives etc. are not very well handled, and there are threads left hanging in a slightly messy way at the end. I imagine it was a bit of a rushed underfunded job. But: beautiful landscape beautifully shot; Dafoe's craggy, haunted presence - alone in the wild forests of Tasmania and, almost like some kind of awkward alien, relating to others; a hint of romance, and some cute moments with a couple of lovely children; the compelling main theme of hunting the elusive Tasmanian Tiger; suspense, and a nail-biting final showdown; and the Tiger itself, were enough to keep me happy. All in all, The Hunter is a very good bit of entertainment.",/review/rw2643552/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2011,lasimp,9," Beautifully filmed Eco Thriller
","I live in Tasmania and I know the country well enough. When I moved here in the 70's it was still considered possible that somehow the tiger had survived in some remote part of the island . Not So. Decades of intensive forestry and clearing and no hints of survival. Still the tantalizing reports occasionally surface. The animal has moved on to pure mythology. Into that scenario comes this beautifully filmed Eco thriller that has a great story line but is also about our beautiful island. The scenes are artfully mixed from various places in Tasmania and the original footage of the tiger is reproduced again for the big screen. How thrilling it was to see that old footage of the thirties (last definite sightings) again.This is the last surviving footage of a peak predator that was not a dog or cat relative but a marsupial and very strange. The film builds slowly and carefully, William Defoe is in a great role which he carries off so well Frances O'Connor and the kids are just entirely in the role! Go see this film if you have the chance and enjoy a beautiful movie I have avoided all discussion of the final 20 minutes go see it and be so surprised!! Its a beautiful and at times tense movie.",/review/rw2643552/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2012,shroyertour,7," Good - will probably watch it again sometime
","This Adventure/Drama movie stars one of my favorite actors, Willem Dafoe. Dafoe has played a variety of roles over the years, with one of my favorites being Paul Smecker in The Boondock Saints (2000). Now this part as the hunter, Martin David, is also one of my favorites. He is a mercenary sent to hunt down what is believed to be the last remaining of a long thought extinct species Tasmanian Tiger.",/review/rw2643552/?ref_=tt_urv

","After seeing this film listed on a couple ""Top Films of the Year,"" highlighted especially for the magnificent cinematography, and feeling in the mood for a brumal, wintry film, I decided to check it out. I was expecting a visually pleasing film with perhaps a mediocre plot; this expectation reinforced by the fact that I've never been overly impressed by Willem Dafoe (though I always saw more potential than his projects tend to drawl out). Well, sometimes your expectations are completely shattered.",/review/rw2643552/?ref_=tt_urv

","I happened to find ""The Hunter"" at the local secondhand DVD store and at a price of $2 it as worth a try. A with Willem Dafoe at the helm you are already well on the way.

5 October 2011,mandalor1138,10," A hunter is contracted to track down the mythical Tasmanian Tiger.
","Best Aussie film I've seen in recent memory. Dafoe as the hunter was brilliant. The children gave faultless, endearing performances and their dialogue (or lack thereof) was totally natural without forced ""it sounds like it's coming from a 20 year-old"" lines. Frances O'Connor and Sam Neil gave nuanced, layered performances. Tasmania as a 'character' was starkly beautiful and the screenplay well served by its 10 year-development. Every scene propels the story. There were some aspects reminiscent of 'The American' (i.e. sparse dialogue, the 'professions' of the protagonists) which is not a bad thing! 10/10 or 11/10 with the extra 'Aussie' star. t: @michaelclarkin",/review/rw2643552/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2012,amnesiac_radar,10," The Hunter
","Amazing, great acting, Willem Defoe is sublime, great cinematography, emotional story, this is a must see. There's a lot of rubbish films these days, I like to watch American TV series as they have huge budgets and have time to develop story lines so things are more satisfying. I think that film making is a saturated market, and most things have been done to death, but it's rare that I see a film that has a clear vision and aim and produces such fantastic results. Willem Defoe has to be one of the greatest American actors alive today, his performance in this film is understated and powerful. There is a sub narrative that is very touching and emotional and very powerful and had me close to tears. I think this is an enigmatic film and really enjoyed seeing Sam Neil playing a part which was so unexpected considering his past performances. A fantastic film for cinema buffs.",/review/rw2643552/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2013,bicgus1,9," Great Film
","It's been long time since I came out so satisfied by a film as I have felt after seeing The Hunter. I must admit that I find Willen Dafoe a captivating actor, and this film suits him magnificently. The script is simple, still quite strong, and it will catch your attention from start to end. The Tasmanian scenery adds to something mysterious, not quite well known to most of us I guess, and indeed I found it so mesmerizing that I took the time to find its exact location on the globe and many of it's geographical characteristics. This is one of those films that although you might not find it great as I did, still will leave you comfortable enough for the time spent.",/review/rw2643552/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2012,JohnRayPeterson,8," An isolate world
","It is a thriller, no doubt, and almost in a classical sense as well. Dafoe draws you into his focused mission; not only does he do this with excellence of execution but he manages to interest you in an other character which we never see, simply by his mostly non verbal references to him. I don't want to spoil your viewing pleasure by saying more. I have rarely seen a character depicted as cold and isolate managing to reveal a caring and principled side with as much convincing result. Some critics faulted the movie for revealing its best part too late; I just don't see how the main character could have been believable otherwise. The story takes place and is actually filmed in Tasmania. How often will you get to see that? ",/review/rw2643552/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2011,BOUF,," Half-hearted outdoors drama with nice scenery but unclear purpose and lack of dramatic tension.
","I never really understood what was supposed to be at stake here. I meet a selfish, very independent hunter (Dafoe - very good) whose mission is to find the apparently extinct Tasmanian tiger, because a big company wants it. I don't know why, but I'm interested. He meets some cliché opposition from the local rednecks, and a grizzled old ham (Sam Neill), who looks predictably shifty and may have something to do with the disappearance of the last man who sought the tiger. That man's kids are needy and believable. I like them and care about them and their relationship with the hunter, but their drugged-out mother is a bore and the hunter's possible burgeoning relationship with her is, like the rest of the story so far, half-hearted. The hunter's search for the tiger is interesting, and mildly dramatic. Then I find out exactly why the big company want the tiger, but it doesn't increase what little stakes there are. There are the occasional VISIBLE threats to the hunter and his quest, but they're also half-hearted. There are the occasional moving moments, and the hunter's realisation that he loves the kids, is nice, but not enough. It's still like like a short film with padding, and an hour has gone by. There's a chance for some really tense action during a nasty confrontation in the bush, but that's bungled by incompetent direction. Then there's a tragedy involving the main characters THAT WE DON'T SEE! (this is a film!) and a sentimental wrap-up. And I'm left wondering what it was all actually about. Here is my conclusion: apart from excellent work from the children, and Dafoe, the key players were presumably unable to identify that the script is very undernourished, so they went ahead and made a film with no real spine.",/review/rw2643552/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2012,kosmasp,6," Almost extinct
","This movie is so not for everyone. The understated performance by Willam Dafoe is just incredible. The way the story turns, might not be what you expect from the beginning, or what people might want it to be. The characters are really good, though you might wish that some things might have been more detailed. There are interesting aspects that get short handed so that the story gets moving and we stay with the main character most of the time.",/review/rw2643552/?ref_=tt_urv

22 October 2011,Likes_Ninjas90,5," The Hunter is like a safari trip with no wildlife in sight
","A biotech research company hires a mercenary named Martin (Willem Dafoe) to hunt down the Tasmanian tiger in the Australian bushland. He finds the territory extremely hostile because the loggers in the area are afraid that environmentalists will endanger their work. Martin takes refuge with a family, including Lucy (Frances O'Connor), who takes sleeping pills and her two small children, one of whom does not speak. Their house is a shambles because they are reeling from the disappearance of Lucy's husband, who went missing while looking for the tiger himself. With the help of some drawings from one of the kids, Martin travels back and forth to the bush, trying to bait the tiger. Yet the ambiguity surrounding Jack (Sam Neill), a fellow bushman, lends a sense of unease to Martin's expedition. ",/review/rw2643552/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2021,sjanders-86430,10," Daniel Nattheim directed
","Willem Dafoe and Sam Neil star in this Tasmanian location film about the Tasmanian tiger. Redfin wants the samples from the almost extinct tiger. Dafoe goes there to get the samples. He becomes the hunter who finds the tiger but also his compassion. His solitary life is opened to the company of two children and their mother. Neil likes the mother who is newly widowed when her husband goes looking for the tiger. This location is the movie's main attraction besides Dafoe whose films are all unique. Here he plays a loner who changes. Neil and Dafoe have done three movies. This location fits Neil, because he grew up in New Zealand. The weather keeps changing. It rains then it snows. It looks like a terrible place to live. The terrain is rocky with low shrubs. The trees are being cut down. I heard on an interview Dafoe had 50 leaches during the shoot. He said he hired someone to teach him survival skills. The animals are different in Tasmania different from Australian animals. Wonderful location and Dafoe.",/review/rw2643552/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2018,Tweetienator,8," The Hunted Hunter

16 July 2012,barnabyrudge,6," Beautiful-looking and powerfully acted drama, searching for a more emotionally attached hook.
","The Hunter, filmed against breathtaking Tasmanian vistas, is a visual triumph throughout. It is also a triumph of acting with excellent performances all round, especially Willem Dafoe. The film is shot by long-time TV director Daniel Nettheim with a surprisingly fine eye for widescreen splendour. His approach is reminiscent of other recent dramas like The American and Winter's Bone, in the sense that the whole thing is a very character-driven piece with opaque plotting and an intentionally slow-burning narrative. Anyone expecting a roller-coaster ride of outdoor action - as suggested by the film's misleading trailer - may well end up disappointed. If, however, you allow yourself to adjust to the film's deliberate and carefully measured pace, there's quite a bit to admire.",/review/rw2643552/?ref_=tt_urv
