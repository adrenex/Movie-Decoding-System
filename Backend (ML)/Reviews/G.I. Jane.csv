19 August 2021,hillnoah-67728,7," Intense af
","I really don't understand the criticism to this film, yes I do understand it may have been a bit unrealistic at times but in life or death instances you may just be overpowered. I found this film very intense, maybe it was being lost in a country with a giant language barrier or it was the thought Of the police trying to assassinate you! It almost made me not wanna go on holiday even after being locked down for a year and my man John Washington always pulls through with the performance, please ignore the hatred and check this out if you get a chance.",/review/rw7225215/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2021,kosmasp,7," Not my vacation
",Remember this is a movie. For that there are things that are heightened. I for one thought it is interesting having some villain shadow ... whatever operate in Greece. Also our main character here is no superhero. He won't Bourne his way out of things ... he has to rely on luck (and some shoody writing on the bad guys part too of course).,/review/rw7225215/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2021,platon_mp,6," not your saturday night movie
","What i liked was the old fashioned way its filmed. Reminds me of classic greek cinema. Also as a Greek watching many beautiful locations or streets that i walked thousand times cetrainly keep my interest. Greek actors were fine, their acting felt natural. Im not a camera expert but the way its filmed feels like you re not watching a movie but events unfolding in front of you, like a documentary.",/review/rw7225215/?ref_=tt_urv

13 August 2021,Helberth_Galarga,4," The ending...
","I liked the movie, I was going to give it an 8 UNTIL Beckett jumped from 4 stories down ON TOP of the car he was chasing on foot, what timing! I guess he channeled his father Denzel Washington in that last bit.",/review/rw7225215/?ref_=tt_urv

14 August 2021,Cineanalyst,5," Delphic American Savior
","What a nauseating beginning to what turns out to be a perfectly mediocre action movie. After going on for some 10 minutes, much more of the eponymous Beckett and his girlfriend's lovey-dovey, cutesy-wootsy foreplay, and I would've been ready to run their car off the road. These American vacationers (well, I guess Alicia Vikander is Swedish, but whatever) in Greece display some of the most irritating intimacy ever filmed, I swear--talking nonsense to each other, fondling each other while driving, drawing a heart on him--grown adults acting like horny teenagers.",/review/rw7225215/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2021,drifter_74,3," Snooze Fest
",An odd pairing of lovers (Washington and Vikander) holidays in Greece. On a road trip they are involved in an accident and this sets of a series of events that forces Washington's character to go on the run.,/review/rw7225215/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2021,mphocastry,4," I usually know within the first 10 minutes if the movie is good or bad.
","This movie was not for John David Washington, they should have cast someone else. The acting was generally really bad, I felt nothing for the characters and I also didn't connect with the story. The Characters who are seemingly ""in-love"" had no chemistry between them. The camera work and editing were the biggest let down, some of the shots were out of focus....not artistically out of focus, like incompetent DP out of focus. Editing department should have cut those out. Some scenes were shot like it was a low budget student film. This movie was hard to watch because the overall quality was really poor.",/review/rw7225215/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2021,margineanvladdaniel,5," Yep. The reviews weren't wrong
","Too many things happened that in reality wouldn't happen. Felt a lot like lazy writing. The trailer got me again. C'est la vie! These great actors didn't deserve to be humiliated like this, but things we do for love. PS the jump on the car was a big turnoff.",/review/rw7225215/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2021,Leofwine_draca,2," Perfect storm
","This was incredibly bad. No wonder the studio didn't want it and I wonder why Netflix picked it up. The perfect storm of what happens when you pick a bad actor and pair him with a bad director. Washington has his dad's voice but none of his talent, so he looks like he's playing in a comedy for the most part. Even worse is the amateur director who adds no suspense, intrigue or thrills to the story, so the whole thing is predictable and to order. The only saving grace this has is the Greek locations, which make a nice change from the norm; the rest is pure trash and one of the worst mainstream films I've seen recently.",/review/rw7225215/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2021,tccandler,3," An empty, meaningless dud...
","This is marketed as a 'Hitchcockian' wrongly-accused-man thriller. Instead, ""Beckett"" is a dull fugitive-on-the-run snooze-fest with a central figure that we don't care about... and a resolution that seems intentionally absurd, so the audience won't question the logic of it all. John David Washington is a total blank in the title role. Alicia Vikander is virtually unused and killed off inside 15 minutes. Everything about this dud feels empty and meaningless.",/review/rw7225215/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2021,matthewlineham,5," Pay check? Or horrible Director
",This will be very brief but it's basically as per the title. Either John David Washington was offered a fat pay check to star in this and he phoned in his performance.,/review/rw7225215/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2021,mitchel1986,9," Ignore all negative (probably US) reviews!!
","The first thing my girlfriend and I said to each other after watching is this was ""why all the negative reviews""?? I'm guessing they either did not see this actual movie, don't care about storylines not taking place in the US or any country the US is or was in war with, or just can't stand Denzel Junior.",/review/rw7225215/?ref_=tt_urv

13 August 2021,airborne_trooper,2," Weak motive and an even weaker storyline
","So the first thing wrong with this movie is it's introduction of characters. To start, we don't know who is who, why they're in Greece to begin with and the murkiness only builds from there. People come and go. Some prove to be allies, others don't. Some things get answered along the way. But as you learn more and little pieces, the only question you keep coming back to is why are they chasing this guy Beckett so hard?! It would have been far easier to just let him go back to the US and he would have been none the wiser to what was really going on. It was only them chasing him so incessantly that put him on the path to figuring out the motive. Which was incredibly weak at best.",/review/rw7225215/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2021,terrylarosa,1," As terrible as movies get.
","The first 15 minutes consist of excruciating, tedious dialogue between the zero chemistry lovebirds. I just FF the rest. Washington stumbles around like a lost puppy ( literally ) for much of the rest though he attains skills enough to keep thwarting the bad hombres ( yes I know they're Greek but whatever ). Washington, unlike his Dad has zero presence. He always looks like he just stumbled into a scene by accident and has to improvise. He's just not a likable actor and he brings down most movies with his catatonic state. Avoid.",/review/rw7225215/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2021,alindsayal,3," A Poor Dull Film

9 December 2021,Neptune165,2," This film is the definition of forgettable
","The plot holes got me. Just wasn't logical how the cops ""always"" just showed up. They shoot him and hit him hundreds times but still alive the whole thing was a mess from the plot to him still somehow winning fights after being shot and stabbed multiple times. Terrible, leap off a cliff into the abyss of absurdly unbelievable ridiculousness. So much bad in one place that I'll only point out what was for me one of the most egregious technical errors a professional crew could make and even jumped off a building, The guy was a tank!! Movie don't make sense, he cause her death and goes back where the accident happened? For what? I'm bored. It's boring. There's no explanation of why any of this chasing and shooting is going on and this man Beckett in a European country staggering up to random steangers bleeding and asking ""do you speak English? The casting was way off. The plot was very cheesy. It was like nobody really tried with this movie. He wasn't fit to play that particular role enough to make me believe he could do all that running and climbing. I got so tired of watching this guy run. Even the way he ran was horrible. Washington had a one dimension facial expression and many of the scenes were ruthlessly disconnected to realism. He looked like a frumpy, misplaced actor struggling to pull off an action role that didn't suite his skill level nor physique.",/review/rw7225215/?ref_=tt_urv
