","FBI agent Audrey Parker (Emily Rose) is sent to Haven, Maine on a case of a prison escapee. She finds help from local cop Nathan Wuornos (Lucas Bryant) and petty criminal smuggler Duke Crocker (Eric Balfour). The town is plagued by strange occurrences.

19 July 2010,boo288,7," Haven has Unique Story lines, Beautifully Filmed
","I'll just jump right in and say SyFy has a good series with ""Haven."" The main characters of FBI Agent Audrey Parker and Haven Deputy Nathan Wournos have their own quirks. Parker is uptight, brusque and by-the-book, while Wournos is laid-back and literally feels no pain. Together, they make an interesting pair. Of course it's been done before but the stories so far have not.",/review/rw2303382/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2015,Shopaholic35,6," Used to be good but is now mediocre.
",Haven has always been the type of show that was pretty good but it never really reached its full potential. The first three seasons defined the show well but once the fourth started everything turned a little sour and it lost the spark it once had.,/review/rw2303382/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2012,MissOceanB,9," A 'Haven' for all audiences
","Haven is an excellent series for so many reasons but the most important are as follows: a) Genres; Haven crosses so many different genres, such as Thriller, some Comedy, some Romance, Mystery, Drama, Sci-Fi and Horror. There are more, but I'll stick to these as they are the ones that stand out most. b) Appeals to a mass audience; to follow up on that last point, given all that the show delivers, it's nearly (or even theoretically) impossible for any individual to enjoy SOME aspect of this show. It will draw you in for more. c) Location and Setting; The strong location backdrop and scene locations are hard to be beat with a series which relies almost entirely on a small Harbor Town...and a beautifully stunning one at that. Beaches, ocean, a marina, boardwalks, rocky Maine coastline (although filmed very close by in Canada) surrounded by thick forests makes it pleasurable to watch for the views alone. And the small harbour town, again, makes for a ""small town feel"" amongst the great cast of characters but also allows room for the outside to come in which can be good at the right time. And when this occurs, the show never fails to maintain its strong beliefs and appeal of the mysterious town of Haven. d) Great acting...a must in any TV or Film! e) Having a link to Stephen King and his novel ""The Colorado Kid"" definitely draws in even more viewers.",/review/rw2303382/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2010,zaenkney,10," Unique and Something to Look Forward to!!!
","The first thing 'Haven' has going for it is the beautiful, seaside Nova Scotian landscape which is masterfully captured for this series. As a result, I feel compelled to take a vacation to a place I have never even considered! Secondly, an eclectic cast of actors make up the core of this new SYFY series. Nicholas Campbell, (formerly of 'Da Vincis Inquest') whose persona seems to slip from the pages of an Erle Stanley Gardner novel, and Lucas Bryant, who does not feel physical pain, represent the law as a father and son duo. Just their last name, Wuornos, colors this picture eerie. Emily Rose, who I really enjoyed in 'Jericho' (a show that ended before its time), performs the role of a temporarily displaced FBI agent who just might get some answers about her own unknown past from this strange little town, should she stay. In the meantime we are torn between the two men in her life, and getting some frights, as well as kicks and giggles out of various characters. ",/review/rw2303382/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2010,Kate_Pafford,9," A fun, new Syfy show with potential
","This show caught my eye when I saw the ad for it on Hulu. I don't have cable, so I'm not really familiar with a lot of the new shows, but after seeing this is based on the Colorado Kid story by Stephen King, and by being a fan of his work, I decided to check out the show.",/review/rw2303382/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2010,mike-ryan455,7," Pleasant, like Warehouse 13 or Eureka
","If you like Warehouse 13 and Eureka, there's a pretty good chance you'll like Haven too. All in all, there's a lot of similarity. We have yet another unlikely guy and gal cop pair in another strange circumstance. It's also out of Sci Fi channel's stable of Canadian made shows.",/review/rw2303382/?ref_=tt_urv

",I am a sci-fi nut. I enjoy watching shows that take me from my meager realm of existence into another plane. I stumbled across this show purely by accident. I think Netflix recommended it based upon my past viewing.,/review/rw2303382/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2014,Vincent_B,4," Put This Back in the Barn!
","This series is pretty typical work of the Syfy network. The premise is based on a small town in Maine called Haven, where some people get supernatural powers for unknown reasons. After a while you get the feeling you are watching some version of X-Men and Heroes mixed with Buffy the Vampire Slayer. You know the show you are viewing is in trouble when they start casting pro-wrestlers in the second season. I continued to watch up to the third season on Netflix but it refused to get better.

21 December 2014,Audrey_L,7," This was a good show once
","I've been watching this show for a fairly long time and it was really interesting and intense. In the beginning, I couldn't wait to see the next episode. In season 4 the quality started to drop and during the 5th season I fell out of love with Haven. What happened to Colorado Kid, why nobody remembers the day he was killed? Why did Jennifer hear what was going on in the barn - what was her connection with the barn? They just swept her and all the unanswered questions about her under a rug since the actress left the show. Who is inspector Howard? How is Croatoan connected to Haven, why does Dave have visions of Croatoan? Why was Dave sent to Haven in the first place? What happened to William, what motivated him to join Mara in the first place? Why did Mara's mother decided to kill her off just when she started to repent and intended to give up her evil ways? That doesn't make sense. I guess Audrey had to be saved because of the fans and Nathan/Audrey shippers. Why were Mara and William capable of creating troubles but Mara's mum (who is much older and more experienced) couldn't? And what was Mara's motivation for creating the troubles? Something about her dad? That wasn't explained at all. And now, with all the troubles being released on Haven, the gang will have a lot of work sorting it all out, I'm not sure that they'll bother to answer all the questions I've written. It seems that the writers are making things up as they go along. Mara's storyline was such a waste of time. During her on-screen time we learned nothing about her past, her motives etc. Only in the last few minutes of the last episode she hinted something about her father being the motive but that was never elaborated. During this season Haven became boring, complex (not in a good way) with massive plot holes. I'm not sure that they'll be able to mend that in the remainder of the series. I give it a 7 because I liked seasons 1-4.",/review/rw2303382/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2012,moonjessica710,6," started off as a King work...
","I started to watch Haven mostly because of the fact that it is based on a Stephen King story, and at first it's what it actually did look like. At the moment I'm watching season 3 and wondering where it went, because it is now so much like any other TV show where the plot is not important as much as the relationship between the characters-four main characters at the moment.The plot has gone through the roof and not in a good direction,and too far, and actually, all that's keeping me watch it is the gorgeous scenery, this beautiful, splendid little town where they are filming the show, and to be honest, I am fond of the characters, so I find myself watching the show to look at the people and the set, because,like I said, it hardly makes any sense anymore, although it seems like it develops further on, it is simply going beyond believable even for a King fan",/review/rw2303382/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2011,JasonUsher,10," One Of The Best Ever
","The series has the suspense, action, drama, and everything else you need to keep viewers tuned in. It is very original and has very good acting. I am not usually a syfy fan, so this show really surprises me. I wasn't able to watch it when it aired so I just recently began watching. I watched all 13 episodes in less than 3 days. I just couldn't stop. Every episode is amazingly entertaining. I think that Emily Rose is a great lead with Lucas Bryant doing a great job, and Eric Balfour is as astonishing as he always has been in every role. to the point Great Cast, Great Story-lines, Great Plots, and Great Jaw Dropping Cliffhangers= Top Notch Show",/review/rw2303382/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2019,Calicodreamin,6," Haven, population: dwindling
","The show centers around an FBI agent and local cop helping to solve people's ""troubles"" sort of like dark superpowers.
The show progresses as we learn more about how the troubles were created and how to end them forever.
In the mean time, droves of people die as these troubles cause death in numerous forms. I would rival the death toll in this show against any other. Luckily they leave any main characters until near the end.
The first three seasons are really good, then the fourth and fifth become a bit ridiculous as the plot line becomes a bit distorted and baddies thwart progress. However, the ending was absolutely amazing.
Would recommend watching if you enjoy syfy shows, and focusing on emotional interactions between characters.",/review/rw2303382/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2010,idunexist-94,7," Give it time...
","Having caught every single episode of Haven up until now, i would say that Haven brings with it a rather weak plot outline in the weekly episodes. Do not expect mystery solving the likes of Fringe or humor like Stargate. Sure, it have its good lines in its episodes. However, what i felt was best in this show is the characters, actors, and that the pace of which the major plot arch in the show plays itself out. The characters are believable, the fr-enemy relationship between characters, the casual flirting, the writers did not overdo it. It clicked really nice. The actors were great, they were able to take some of the rather boring lines in the script and inject some life into them. Overall, i would give haven a chance and let it pick itself up and find its way around. At least it's much more watchable then the first season of V.",/review/rw2303382/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2021,miaalike,8," A sci fi series that draws its inspiration deep
","In the eerie east - northern atmosphere, in a small portuary town, an outside FBI agent discovers that she is capable of counteracting and appeasing the supernatural afflictions of the locals. And this is just the beginning. Haven is a long, twisting series that enthralls the viewer into its stories, and meets other series like Lost or 12 Monkeys in motives that, once you identify them, can't help but wonder a bit why these productions put them into the public conciousness again and again?! I have no answer to that. But nevertheless, this production is fascinating, the main actress is as nice, as she is troubled (her character reminds of Olivia from Fringe, in a way), and yes, the stared in the cult series JFC. Since there are a lot of episodes and from a point on the main mystery is revealed, only to spiral into more questions, I will avoid spoilers and leave it at ""start watching it, and beware that it becomes more deep than you would expect"".",/review/rw2303382/?ref_=tt_urv

16 December 2020,axxmqmcy,6," What happened?
","I'd almost rather watch a bad show than see a good show outlive its glory to the point it becomes bad...
It seems most every show based on a King novel is doomed to fail. This show is no exception. Although seasons 1-3 were a good, slow build, seasons 4-5 were a fast de line straight to the toilet.
You could tell that the writers had a good, thoughtful story line for the first few seasons, then were completely surprised when the show was picked up for seasons that outlived their story. There's almost a tangible switch, where a great story has been filled with gibberish.
It would have been better if we'd never known what happens with Audrey Parker or why she comes back every 27 years fresh as a daisy. Instead, we get some interdimensional nonsense that hopes we forget about everything prior and instead just buy into this bs about ppl from other dimensions escaping to Maine?
I see why the show ended, just 2 seasons too late...",/review/rw2303382/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2017,oliviercouriol,8," ""Haven"" It's Really Intriguing
","Only recently, I came to know about this series and started watching a bit hesitantly. Trust me, It's really intriguing. The plot moves on real quick with seriously detailed characters. Initially, as you would expect, it crawls at a slow pace, but it's really understandable as it's all about building the story.",/review/rw2303382/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2012,pratima347,9," Great opening to season 3!
","After much waiting for season 3,Haven returns with a bang! The first episode in the third season looks great,the visuals are very good and the acting of the entire cast looks believable. Emily Rose looks great and opens the third season with a mighty resolution to find out more about Lucy. Unlike the previous seasons,this one seems to move ahead faster,which works actually. Lucas Bryant looks good as usual in his chief avatar. All in all,if you haven't seen this series yet,then please watch it. I am very happy, because the third season looks worth the wait. It's stunning,with a dash of romance,friendship and cop drama. Perfect entertainment!",/review/rw2303382/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2010,sebpopcorn,," Good premise
","I like the idea of Haven, it's a good premise but I've found the stories a bit uninspired. It's pretty obvious how things will pan out in most of the episodes and the attempts to misdirect you only serve to eliminate one of the very few characters as a suspect for whatever odd things are going on. Despite the paranormal theme it's pretty run of the mill writing.",/review/rw2303382/?ref_=tt_urv
