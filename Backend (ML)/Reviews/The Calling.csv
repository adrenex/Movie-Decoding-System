6 May 2019,kosmasp,9," How to remake
","While I really liked the weirdness of the Original (you can't really put your finger on it and what it tried to tell us), this really steps up to the task. I know that just writing this or just the rating will have some fans of the Original riled up. Now I'm not trying to take anything away from your memories or your taste, so if you are reading on, I thank you for being open minded.",/review/rw4602231/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2020,UniqueParticle,10," Not sure about the hate but this is a masterpiece
","I'll probably get hate for it but I haven't seen the original, I'm sure it's incredible! Suspiria is incredibly well filmed with such a style that makes it feel old with a awesome soundtrack! Glorious eerie vibes in many parts which is nice. Very much reminds me of Black Swan just very different and more terrifying; which I love! Electrifying experience that I didn't expect, I cant't believe Suspira didn't get more praise.",/review/rw4602231/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2020,ssrw-34960,10," Not what you expect
","A lot of bad reviews on here probably from those expecting a copy of the original. I personally didn't want a copy (what's the point in that?), the original had a chilling score and beautiful visuals but wasn't all that scary. They say this movie is an art scene but in my opinion, the original focuses more on art as it does actual horror. This Suspiria delves more into the coven of witches and the substance you would want from a so called horror movie. I am a massive horror fan but I pick what I watch wisely as the horror genre as a whole is only 25% good. If you want substance then watch this film, if you want cheap jump scares, lack of story and crappy Hollywood types then look elsewhere.",/review/rw4602231/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2018,drownsoda90,9," A wild and wicked reimagining of a classic
","Luca Guadagnino's reimagining of ""Suspiria"" follows the same core plot trajectory as Argento's original film, detailing an American dancer who finds herself a fish out of water at a German dance academy run by witches. Where Argento's film was an acid-trip fairytale erring on Disney-like horror, Guadagnino's rendition of this story is an ambitious period piece underpinned by the political tumult of 1977 Germany.",/review/rw4602231/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2019,CinemaClown,," Too Long. Too Slow. And Too Far Up Its Own Ass.
","Gone is the exaggerated colour palette, the elaborate set pieces, the nightmarish soundtrack & the no-nonsense premise of the original. In fact, Luca Guadagnino's Suspiria departs from everything that made Dario Argento's horror classic unique, and is a dull, dismal & divisive remake that's exhausting, frustrating & one hell of a slog.",/review/rw4602231/?ref_=tt_urv

","I felt compelled to respond to the haters out there. This is a modern classic. One of the best horror movies ever made. If you do not like to think then this movie is not for you. If you liked the Shining then this movie is for you. It's not as scary as say Hereditary but it is more inventive, more compelling and will haunt you. Every adult should see this movie. If you're sick of the Hollywood typical tripe like the Conjuring, Halloween or terrible found footage films, then see something the likes of which you'll never see again.",/review/rw4602231/?ref_=tt_urv

","You may -- or may not -- have noticed that for all the Argento films I've reviewed, I've never spoken about 1977's Suspiria. This supernatural horror -- not giallo -- movie is hard for me to write about because it's above reproach. It is, as I've mentioned about other films, an absolute movie, one whose kaleidoscopic and sonic assault -- courtesy of Goblin -- blast you from the moment the film begins. I can't really say anything new or add anything that hasn't been said and I doubt anyone wants to read me gushing about the colors or murders in the film ad nauseam. If you haven't seen it, do so. Please watch it instead of this movie.",/review/rw4602231/?ref_=tt_urv

","An admirer of the classic Dario Argento film, director Luca Guadagnino, fresh off the major success of ""Call Me By Your Name"", elected to foolishly remake the movie, throwing out all that made the original great. No more fabulous Technicolor experiments in color, no pulsating score in the vein of Goblin, but instead a stupid decision to retain Argento and Daria Nicolodi's 3 Mothers supernatural story, the weakest element of the show.",/review/rw4602231/?ref_=tt_urv

","I sat through the entire film, and honestly do not understand any part of the plot. The film is basically a collection of bizarre scenes.

","Most people call this movie out as ""bland"" or ""pretentious"" or get upset this doesn't have any ""classic"" horror. they are dead wrong. if you are a fan of the original, you will appreciate this piece for its sheer contrast but similarity to its predecessor. It is beautifully dark, and a wonderful, nightmareish horror flick. This movie is unconventional and different with its' dynamic and cinematography.

10 March 2019,namashi_1,9," A Delicious Remake Of A Legendary Film!
","Dario Argento's 1977 Campy Horror film SUSPIRIA left an unending impression on filmmakers and film-buffs alike. I, myself, loved that film and hold it high to this day. And so is the case for Director Luca Guadagnino, who has passionately remade the classic with a frightening new vision. And Luca, a fine director, delivers a highly impressive remake of a much-loved classic. The brand new version may not surprise the buffs of the original, and may not appeal to all, but its distinctive vision is hard to ignore. This is deliciously twisted storytelling!",/review/rw4602231/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2018,preppy-3,1," Horrendous remake.
","Redo of Dario Argento's masterpiece. Susie Bannion (Dakota Johnson) goes from the US to Germany to attend a dance academy. She soon finds out it's run by witches and they want her to join them. The original was only 98 minutes long, done in super bright color, moved like lightning and had a terrifying score. This one goes OVER 150 minutes, looks drab and dreary, has terrible acting, ugly gore, gratuitous female nudity and ends up not making a lot of sense. There are pointless sequences involving politics and dull dance lessons. Also way too many dance sequences which are just laughably bad. My audience sat through it all quietly until the ending. At that point it got so stupid and OTT people started laughing! Dull, pointless and insulting. Skip it.",/review/rw4602231/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2019,jrgibson-51931,1," i need a T-shirt that says 'I watched ALL of Suspiria"".
","One reviewer said that if you liked 'The Shining"" you would love this film - I liked The Shining but found Suspiria to be tedious, pretentious, overlong and lacking a strong narrative. To make an effective 152 minute horror film would require a strong screenplay and a great director/editor and Suspiria is sadly lacking in these areas. Nearly every recent film could do with removing about thirty minutes and Suspiria does not have the content for more than 90 minutes but here we have film-makers suffering from the delusion that they are Stanley Kubrick but are closer to Ed Wood jr with a large budget. The only thing that impressed in this turkey was Tilda Swinton's make-up and like Vice, good make-up does not compensate for the multitude of shortcomings in these films.",/review/rw4602231/?ref_=tt_urv

7 November 2018,udar55,10," Welcome to the short list of good horror remakes
","When a remake of SUSPIRIA (1977) was first announced in the mid-2000s, I bristled at the thought. You can't remake one of the singularly standout artistic visions of the horror genre. You can't run with Dario Argento's style, Luciano Tovoli's cinematography or Goblin's iconic score. It would be as idiotic as someone saying, I don't know, they want to do a shot-for-shot remake PSYCHO (1960). Haha. When David Gordon Green was on as director, I had little faith (apparently the new HALLOWEEN he made proves that). When he left and Luca Guadagnino came on, my interest was piqued because all the stuff he was saying about where he wanted to take it sounded interesting. He knew he couldn't simply remake the film so instead he did his own thing. And, honestly, the end result is stunning. When the film ended I just sat there in kind of awe, amazed at how two filmmakers could have the same material and deliver two wildly different and both excellent takes. What Guadagnino and screenwriter David Kajganich are able to pull from the source material is incredible. There are themes that I don't think even Argento and co-writer Daria Nicolodi even knew they had in there, such as the idea of motherhood's path in life, the duality of man (or woman here), or what an artist (here dancers) does when they are performing the work of another artist. Fitting theme for a remake. Guadagnino wisely decided to walk next to Argento rather than try to fill his shoes and created a companion piece. Full of stunningly beautiful and surreal moments, this goes on the short list of great horror remakes. Anyway, that wraps up 2018 for me as I won't see a better film this year.",/review/rw4602231/?ref_=tt_urv

","It was impossible not to have high expectations for Luca Guadagnino's remake of ""Suspiria.""

","The original Suspiria (1977) is considered by many to be the best film from Italian director Dario Argento. I don't agree. The garish colours, the cacophonous soundtrack, the silly premise (a renowned dance school is a front for a coven of witches): apart from a couple of inventive kills, it just didn't work for me (I prefer Tenebrae and Phenomena).",/review/rw4602231/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2020,robertemerald,10," Beautifully creative and original, though I haven't seen the original movie
","One way you can rate a movie is to ask yourself how prepared you are to watch it again. There are a number of ways a movie can have return merit. As movies are pictorial art this is different to a book. One way is that the movie is such a visual splendour, and the various facets of filmmaking are so beautifully done, then it's no problem to watch it again, like having a second scoop of the same flavour ice-cream. Another way to impress is to have amazing special effects, which with cgi these days, incorporates many amazing movies. I call that a wow factor. For art-house movies, of which I consider Suspiria to be one, then one has to be so impressed by the story presentation, as through various key images, that you'd love to watch it again to gain more insight and further understand the story. This is Suspiria, with the added bonus that it also has some wow factor, particularly at moments of extreme violence. That violence is original and striking. To further explain, I recently read about captivity during WWII, and one way prisoners could record and tell their stories was by rushing off a quick sketch on a tiny sheet of paper what they had witnessed. That scrap of paper doesn't tell you the back story or specifically what lead to the scene described, nor necessarily give you exact details on the characters involved. Nevertheless it can be a powerful and magnetic image. You want to know more. That is how I see Suspiria. Suspiria is easily one of the most engaging witch coven stories ever told (that's not a spoiler, as there is a mention on the back of the dvd). I loved the way the filmmakers played with the notion that you never really know what people are really like just on their appearance. Suspiria is all about hiding in plain sight, and of unsuspecting characters being more, or less, than they let on, and of situations that are never black or white or exactly defined. There is a classy backdrop from repeated news casts that depict a hostage situation on the news, which is wonderful parallel symbolism. There's a lot of detail in this movie, in the motivations, the powers, and the dark history. Even if you don't agree with me, Suspiria must have something going for it, or 542 user reviews here at IMDb wouldn't have been written already, only two years after its release.",/review/rw4602231/?ref_=tt_urv
