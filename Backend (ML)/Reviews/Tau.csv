24 June 2022,Foutainoflife,8," Austin Butler Was Amazing!
",It's probably not the best biopic ever made but I personally loved this take on Elvis. I loved that it exposed The Colonel's abuse and gave some insight to just how much Elivs worked for the benefit of others. He took care of everyone.,/review/rw8649253/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2022,rannynm,10," Incredibly exciting and a roller coaster of emotions! Incredible performance by Austin Butler

4 July 2022,zkonedog,7," Entertaining, But Can't Get Out Of Its Own Way Enough To Be Great
","There are certainly times in which Baz Luhrmann's ""Elvis"" is an engaging and entertaining biopic of rock-and-roll's biggest star. The performance numbers are often incredible and Austin Butler inhabits all aspects/ages of the lead role adeptly. Unfortunately, Luhrmann's let's say ""unique"" style of filmmaking can't quite get out of its way long enough (especially in the early goings) for this to be a top-notch flick.",/review/rw8649253/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,slak96u,6," Big bright shiny vapidness...
","What a mess.... nearly incoherent storyline. Over 2.5 hours of film, yet after watching you know Elvis no better. It's simply a bunch scenes strung together, accompanied by music, but little to no plot and a complete lack of interesting dialog. The film feels almost like a bad fever dream, arbitrarily switching from scene to scene with little to no connection. Too much attention is put in Parker/Hanks, when he's not narrating he's the focus of every scene he's in. Thankfully Austin Butler and Olivia DeJonge do everything they can to save the train wreck, they still can only do so much, but both are fantastic with what they were given. The music varies, at times it's fantastic, others it's inappropriate and awkward.",/review/rw8649253/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2022,Draysan-Jennings,5," Totally Overrated
","For the first two hours it felt like I was watching the longest music video of all time. It was all over the place and extremely rushed. And what was up with the soundtrack? Why the hell was there a Backstreet Boys song in the film? Not to mention the Hip Hop? I didn't get it. This film was hard to get through and I couldn't take Austin Butler serious. I was glad when it was over. I guess if you're a fan of Elvis give it a shot. If not, pass on it, it's nothing special. Basic 5 star film.",/review/rw8649253/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2022,mikemars38,6," I can't put my finger on why but was a little disappointed with this movie
","Firstly Austin Butler was great , he could actually be Elvis as he looked so much like him and clearly worked hard to do Elvis justice , but I didn't really enjoy the movie but can't put my finger on why , the Main actors did a good job but I couldn't really get an emotional connection with them or the story line until the very end , I thought the legend Tom Hanks had too much of a part to play and Elvis didn't get enough , the story seemed to bounce all over the place and to me just felt and bit disjointed , Im no movie critic or expert so I recommend seeing it as lots have really raved about it but I woo the be watching it again.",/review/rw8649253/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2022,DeadMansTrousers,3," What movie is everyone else watching?
","I normally love Baz Luhrmann's films but this was a chore to sit through. When I sit down to watch a film about Elvis I expect the soundtrack of the film to be full of Elvis music or even the music that inspired him. Why they decided to have this film filled with modern day hiphop/rap music is beyond me and it totally detracts from the story. Apart from that the acting in this makes it feel like a direct to dvd film you'd rent out of the redbox, even that from Tom Hanks! I had such a hard time getting through this 3 hour film, I honestly don't understand how it has such a high score.",/review/rw8649253/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2022,Xstal,7," Shaken, Rattled & Rolled...
","A young lad from Memphis discovers early on in life the melodies that will make him shake, the tunes and the beats and the songs that will give him a break, in a world of prejudice and hate, intolerance and injustice, he will strive to jive, sing to swing, shake, rattle and roll, to relieve a generation of the mundane and prosaic, the traditions and stale rituals, the habitual and the conditional, while bringing joy, delight and happiness - all with the help of a crafty, conniving, contriving, self-serving, calculating and cunning craftsman who would swindle and trick and cheat him out of as much of his hard earned wealth as he could lay a finger on, brilliantly portrayed by Tom Hanks.",/review/rw8649253/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2022,fjk1138-731-161881,1," Elvis didn't leave the building, I did
","For the record, I'm 50 years old, been listening to Elvis since I was 5. I have box sets of all his music, been to Graceland, met his original band mates, watched every video or movie about him over the years, and read a few books. I wasn't there with him when he was alive, but suffice to say I know the man and the music at least reasonably well.",/review/rw8649253/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2022,sensorshot,6," Colonel Tom is a Better Title.
","There is a lot to unpack about what I did not like about this movie but I also feel I need to 'fess up about my love of Elvis and growing up a fan as a child. I was 11 when he died and it came as a big shock. In rural Norfolk where we lived mostly 20 years in the past so it seemed that he had only just arrived. I spent a long time after following the legend. The Kurt Russel movie, the odd ""That's the Way it is / Was"" documentaries - stylistically plundered for this movie and of course all the movies. Owning 40 Greatest Hits was pretty much issued to you growing up. Then Punk Rock and New Wave came and Elvis just became the distant past, even if he did shock his audience in a way Johnny Rotten could only dream. Occasionally American Trilogy would come on the radio and I'd crank it up and do an Elvis impersonator sing-along, ""Wisha was, inna lanna cotton"" I played it on my excited drive to see this movie I had been waiting for, saying to my partner, ""If this song is not referenced in the movie, I'll be stunned, it is definitive Elvis"".",/review/rw8649253/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2022,ethanbresnett,7," A slight let down
","Compared to other musical biopics that have hit the screen in recent years (Rocket Man, Bohemian Rhapsody), 'Elvis' is tad underwhelming. It is a solid film but Luhrmann's direction failed to fully draw me in and impress.",/review/rw8649253/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2022,hpcmakeup,2," Ugh Tom Hanks
",For me Tom Hanks looked and sounded ridiculous. His makeup was absurd and his voice was irritating. Austin looked good and the wardrobe was ok but the movie was one long muddled weird music video. For some reason they portrayed Elvis as a whiny wimpy immature baby and that was not what I had heard he was like especially from my father who did a movie with him. This movie is really terrible. The entire first 20 minutes is a total waste of time. I think putting Tom Hanks in any role in any movie is just too hard to not just see Tom Hanks! And I was way done with this movie after an hour but for some reason it just kept going on and on. Ugh really terrible!,/review/rw8649253/?ref_=tt_urv

7 August 2022,pajapan,1," Directed like a movie trailer that lasts 2 hours & 40 mins

26 June 2022,aciessi,6," The King and I
","Elvis is really something to behold. It's over-the-top, gluttonously indulgent, shamelessly embellished, dizzying, loud, flashy and in-your-face for the greater part of 2 and a 1/2 hours. But is it entertaining as hell? You betcha. Elvis Presley, somewhere, is smiling down on this gaudy, golden-encrusted tribute of his. This doesn't feel like the biopic of a man, or an artist, but rather, a mythical Greek god. If ever you wanted the King to get his epic due on the big screen, Baz Luhrmann has delivered it in spades. He may have been the best, and only director capable of making an Elvis biopic. But of course, you will need to suspend your disbelief and go for the ride that Baz takes you on. You may need to bring a barf-bag. Elvis quickly breezes through the King's life, from his childhood in Tulepo, MS, to his glory days in Memphis, to the days in captivity in Las Vegas. Shadowing him throughout is Colonel Tom Parker, his devious, greedy and fame-starved manager. He is played here by Tom Hanks. Folks, I don't even know where to begin. This is easily his worst performance ever. He's less reminiscent of the real man, and more like an Andy Kaufman character. That makeup, that accent... my god, man. What were they thinking? It takes you completely out of the movie. Luckily, Elvis is so freewheeling in that classic Baz Lurhmann style, it's easy to forget how bad Hanks is here. Austin Butler on the other hand is a fabulous Elvis. He goes above and beyond your average impersonator, let me tell you. He looks nothing like Elvis, and you still can believe him in the role. We go through his life, through every phase, and yet, we never go deep enough. Sorely underrepresented was his downfall in the 1970's, which, if explored in all of its tragedy, could have put this film on a whole other level. But perhaps that messes with the Elvis myth. Perhaps that would've reminded us that Elvis is and was as human as we all are. Lurhmann clearly disagrees. A mixed bag, but it's a blast. God love the music. The music, the music, the music.",/review/rw8649253/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,MooWoolf1,5," A huge letdown
",I'll be short here. I'm familiar with Elvis. Kurt Russel played the best Elvis on screen. The '79 movie is simply better on every level and on top of that you hear Elvis sing and you see someone on screen that looks pretty much like him. (In this movie you hear the actor sing while he doesn't even look like Elvis.),/review/rw8649253/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2022,El-Kapitoshka,5," Elvis - Heavily Embellished for the ""WOKE"" Generation
","There are elements of this film that are really good, but there is sadly more of it that is utter nonsense. That's a shame and there is a narrative hidden in here to appease the BLM/Woke generation. Elvis was no activist, but he did grow up among black people and was heavily inspired by the culture, especially gospel.",/review/rw8649253/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2022,pietclausen,1," A bad fabrication libelous to Elvis's Estate
","Having grown up in the Elvis era and having followed his career from his youth to and beyond his death, this film is insulting and a fabrication of true facts. Yes, Tom Parker was Elvis' manager from his early singing career to the end, but the relationship was never, ever as bad as this film portrays. Elvis's career flourished and they both benefited from it. Only in the latter years did Elvis start using drugs which led to his early death. But this film was not about Elvis, but about Tom Parker and his scheming business practices. Naming this film ELVIS is degrading to the Elvis name and the producers should be taken to task by Elvis's estate for this reason.",/review/rw8649253/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2022,DarkVulcan29,10," Austin Butler became Elvis Presley
","It's like Austin Butler was no more and I just saw Elvis Presley, you clearly see he did his homework on the man, and it pays off in his performance. Some say he got overshadowed by Tom Hanks who plays Colonel Parker, but I have to disagree, don't get me wrong, Hanks was good has Parker, but I never thought for a second that he overshadowed Butler in anyway.",/review/rw8649253/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2022,SamUnfiltered1979,10," Oscar Worthy
","I normally am not a fan of Baz Luhrman. I am a huge Elvis fan. I was ready to hate it based on my distaste for his other works. But I was enraptured. This movie is going to sweep the Oscars. I was crying at the end, you can tell Baz Luhrman loves Elvis. Thank you, Baz. This was a joy to experience.",/review/rw8649253/?ref_=tt_urv

9 August 2022,EAA123,4," another waste of millions of dollars.
","There are way better Elvis movies out there than this one. It almost seems cartoonish. Hell, Elvis meets Nixon blows this movies away! It seems to me the writers and producers just borrowed scenes from all the other Elvis movies and other movies like Great Balls of Fires and The Buddy Holly story which have similarities to them. There was even a great scene in Martin Scorsese's HBO series Vinyl with Elvis, The Colonel and Jerry Canavale. Don't waste your time with another waste of millions of dollars. To quote many actors in Hollywood, the budget of this movie could've ended world hunger or least fed a few million people......",/review/rw8649253/?ref_=tt_urv
