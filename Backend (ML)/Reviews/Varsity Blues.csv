26 January 2012,scooterberwyn,8," An old-fashioned ""feel-good"" movie - and there's nothing wrong with that!
","I went with friends to see JOYFUL NOISE, the film starring Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton. What can I say about it?",/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2012,tavm,7," Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah provide an enjoyable cast of musical talents in Joyful Noise
","Just watched this movie with my movie theatre-working friend. This is a musical drama with the leads of Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton in conflict over the budding romance of Latifah's teenage daughter and Parton's just-arrived troubled similar-aged grandson. Well, actually there's also the matter of the just deceased choir master played briefly by Kris Kristofferson and Latifah replacing him...I'll just say that while the story and characterizations are just devices to hang musical numbers into, they're enjoyably slight enough that one does feel some connections to them when they're showcased. All I'll say now is I had a pretty good time watching Joyful Noise especially when the Big Final Number came on. So, yeah, that's a recommendation.",/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2012,bwayluver,6," Worth Seeing
","I originally had no interest in seeing it. The reviews were bad, the trailer looked just 'ok'. But a friend of mine wanted to see it and asked me to come along. Why not? ",/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2012,mrsluggy2001,8," Not nearly so bad as some of the reviews might lead you to believe
","Yes, the script was mighty thin in places and tried to tackle way too many subjects in too short a period of time (the poor economy, marriage struggles, death, teenage angst/rebellion, teenage love, etc., etc.), but despite its flaws this movie provided some fine musical entertainment, and pretty much delivered on its goal of being an uplifting movie-going experience.",/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2012,simplyjanise,8," A Feel Good Movie!!
","I liked the movie a lot. I've always loved both Dolly Pardon and Queen Latifah. I don't know who thought to put those two together but for my money, it worked. Yes, Dolly has had a lot of work done. SO WHAT? She's a sweetheart and still feisty! The plot has some definite misses, it was predictable and cheesy at times, but it was fun! Yes it was a bit of a ""Sister Act 2"" combined with ""Footloose"" rip off but again I say: SO WHAT?? I enjoyed the movie. Is it going to win an academy award? Nope. But it was nice way to spend an afternoon. It had me dancing in my seat and left me feeling good. And that's exactly what I wanted it to do. We have a winner!!",/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2012,wcameronmartin,7," It's Contrived, but Feels Good All the Same
","My review of the Joyful Noise Movie: Every single solitary, gimmicky, tired, old, wore-out, overdone movie cliché that's ever been used in any contrived, family-targeted movie in the history of cinema... and yet, the music was solid, the characters given some genuinely funny material to work with, and therefore there are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life. It was fantastic to hear new material from one of my favorite vocalists and lyricists, Dolly Parton... but it was worth the ticket price alone, to see Dolly ""poppin' and lockin' for Jesus!""

13 January 2012,Chris_Pandolfi,6," The Gospel According to Latifah and Parton
","""Joyful Noise"" is a harmless, well-intentioned movie that was clearly made with no goal in mind apart from being uplifting. It's easy to see why the critical response has been largely negative; in its innocence, it leaves many questions unanswered, whitewashes a number of harsh realities, and repeatedly sidesteps plausibility for the sake of entertainment. While I cannot argue with these observations, and while the film is ultimately too flawed and predictable for me to recommend it, I'm not inclined to be ruthless. Writer/director Todd Graff has his heart in the right place. And because the subject is a gospel choir, he treats us to a number of well-arranged musical interludes that showcase some real talent. Regardless of whether the songs are Christian, pop, or country, passion pours off of the screen each and every time.",/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2012,nybroadus,9," Worth checking out!
",I enjoyed this movie with my 12 year old son and 17 year old daughter. The gospel music and contemporary pop made it appealing to all ages. The movie was funny and not too heavy but delivered a good wholesome message. Dolly has been a long time favorite of mine and I had almost forgotten how funny she can be. The entire family could take away a message of hope from Joyful Noise. Who knew Queen Latifia could sing so beautifully? This is an all star cast of talented young people with a witty twist and a great upbeat mood from start to finish.,/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2012,msosment,9," Great! A must see for Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah fans!
","Storyline was a bit familiar, but it is presented in a new, fresh way. There is a strong main storyline and other small background stories which link back to it. The stories are touching and show great sensitivity. Very well played. Even though it takes place in the south, there is a rich diversity in the movie. It paints a lovely picture of the new south. Dolly Parton is charming as always. Queen Latifah is perfect in this role. They play off each other beautifully. Kiki Palmer and Jeremy Jordan are fantastic and fresh. The singing and choreography are top notch. Constant flowing entertainment. Never a dull moment. Well worth my time and money.",/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2019,uberdonkey6,7," Fun, dramatic and some great singing
","Ok, so my biases out the way: I'm not into Christian films per se, but I love Queen Latifah in most of her films. She doesn't fail to disappoint, being charismatic and larger than life whilst still being humble. Her daughter in the film has a great voice (is a singer herself in real life) with a Michael Jackson cover that brought tears to my eyes.",/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2020,HotToastyRag,7," Cute, but corny
","It's no understatement to say Joyful Noise would be nothing without Queen Latifah. I know I'm partial to her anyway, but she brings a level of class and actual acting to the film that no one else does. In this ridiculously written, cheesy, Hallmark-esque comedy, she manages to get tears in her eyes when she looks at her Asberger's affected son. When she argues with Keke Palmer, her attitude-inflicted daughter, she has a great level of depth that only a mother can truly appreciate.",/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2012,chipzehnder,9," Great mix of music and comedy.
","an awesome mix of comedy and music it has a very glee feel to it and Dolly is in top form as is Queen Latifah though they are over shadowed at times by the younger stars. Touching at times and funny too! Jeremy Jordan is best known for the musical Newsies and he adds an enhance essence to the movie. yes at times there is corn in the comedy but you have to expect that with Dolly. This is a great family film if i was rating this as a family film it would get a 10+. The musical numbers are awesome with Kirk Franklin in the cast who could go wrong? Keke Palmer is just awesome as Latifahs daughter. And Jeremy Jordan is a gem as Dollys Grandson ""Randy"" Take your family or your girlfriend a great time will be had by all!!",/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2012,cmatsumoto702,1," Blehhhh
","This movie inspired me to create an IMDb account just to review it. I am so angry that a movie that should have been a sure-fire hit with Dolly, Queen, and (surprise! Kris Kristofferson in his first singing role in decades) was such an abominable dud. Not any of the actors fault, just poor directing and editing. I don't think the director understands how to tell a story. Instead of clearly defining the plot, developing characters, and building up a climax, there is just a whole lotta ""stuff"" going on that contributes pretty much nothing to the central plot. I'm not even sure what the plot is! Was it: a. The choir encounters several challenges to win a contest, b. Queen Latifah needs to spend time with her daughter and help her mentally challenged son c. Dolly and Queen need to get along, d. the supporting actress needs to stop sleeping with Asian men, e. Dolly needs to get over her dead husband and help her quasi-troubled runaway grandson, f. Grandson and Queens daughter need to get jiggy wit Jesus? Everything is so cheezily and sloppily thrown together in this movie, it doesn't really make sense. And why, Why do all the characters speak in stale platitudes??!!",/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2012,MasterChiefrei,3," Awkward
",A friend of mine and I were watching this movie together so she and I could both confirm how awkward a lot of the scenes were. We started the movie with a positive attitude and couldn't wait to see how Latifah and Dolly handled together. The beginning started out OK but got awkward fast. Spoilers start here. ,/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2017,davispittman,7," Cliché yet pretty fun and entertaining
","It is true that Joyful Noise is a cliché film, some people may call it contrived or even cheesy, maybe there's some amount of truth in those claims, but it certainly doesn't change the fact that it is still entertaining and very fun to watch. It centers around a southern church choir and them competing in a big competition between gospel choirs. All the characters fit into the movie in an important way. Queen Latifah's character has many complexities to her, she is probably the heaviest character in the whole movie. Dolly Parton plays an older widow who is a big financial supporter of the church. The younger characters, Randy and Olivia (Keke Palmer) are pretty well put together, not nearly as heavy as Parton or Latifah, but still fairly good, and they accomplished what they needed to accomplish in the movie. The writing is what I really like because sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's sad and emotional, and then other times it is very uplifting and positive. I think there's a good mixture and range. I loved the music, the hip/new gospel performances that they put on, especially in the end, is very fun and it's almost impossible not to sing along. Dolly Partons to the moon and back with her deceased husband was a great thing to have in there too, because it added to the Movies heart and the overall feeling. Overall joyful noise is an entertaining somewhat light film that almost anyone can enjoy. And it's not overly religious or preachy either. 7/10.",/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2012,sddavis63,2," At Least It Has Some Good Music
","Some of the music contained in ""Joyful Noise"" is pretty good. Which is a good thing. Otherwise there wouldn't be much - actually, there really wouldn't be anything - to make this movie worth watching.",/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2020,keepitreal60,7," Great Film to combat all the doom and gloom at present in the world.
","Excellent Gospel music, and top shelf humor. A script of depth too, touching on the human condition and the pitfalls of being young, nice to see a film where the main characters are talented woman.",/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2013,Marc_Action,2," Joyful Silence
","Horrible, horrible, horrible!!! Where to begin? It didn't take me even 5 minutes of viewing this dreadful film to see how bad it is. The acting is beyond bad, the dialog is elementary, the plot is hardly believable, and worst of all, for a movie about a gospel choir, it should be a sin for there to be such obvious lip-syncing going on during some of the singing scenes.",/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2015,SnoopyStyle,6," great singing and blah story
","In small town Georgia, Vi Rose Hill (Queen Latifah) and G.G. Sparrow (Dolly Parton) don't really get along. When the choir director G.G.'s husband dies unexpectedly, Vi takes over with the support of Pastor Dale (Courtney B. Vance). Vi is raising her kids Olivia (Keke Palmer) and Walter with Asperger while her husband returns to the military. G.G.'s rebellious grandson Randy Garrity (Jeremy Jordan) comes to town and falls for Olivia. The local choir struggles to find their sound to win the Joyful Noise Competition.",/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2012,Patmarie,5," good moments

",It's nice to see a choir feel good movie so late in 2012. These are the types of movies that you watch just to feel good. It has a cast that makes you feel good and the story itself just makes you feel like you're with them riding to the end. Very fun loving feel good movie.,/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2012,mark.waltz,4," Let He Who is Without Sin Cast the First Screenplay....
","'Cause unfortunately, that is what this ""competition comedy/drama"" is missing, along with likable characters, believable situations and a definitive moral message that should have been the subject. The story is about a small town Georgia church choir who keeps going to the final rounds of a church choir competition and loosing only to face one more after the death of their choir master. Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah, two totally likable performers, are given the unfortunate opportunity to play truly unlikable characters as they fight for control of the choir. The two characters prove that sometimes the supposed Godly church goers are even more toxic than the sinners they are trying to convert.",/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv

","A return to a Great Family film without cartoons! Lots of great music, incredibly beautiful scenery, exceptional performances, and that's all in the first five minutes! Seriously, a movie like this comes along once every couple of years, and the words ""feel good"" are usually attached to the comments made by the critics. If you can't feel good after seeing this, you need to have someone check your pulse and respiration.",/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2012,patsworld,7," Joyful Noise Is A Joy For The Ears
","Being no fan of plastic surgery, and a big admirer of people who wear their age naturally with all the beauty and grace given them, it must be said that Dolly Parton simply looks like a goofy caricature of her former self. But dang, that voice is still there! The girl can sing....as can everyone else in this movie full of foot-tapping, you-just-want-to-clap gospel-style music. A film about a church full of people brimming over with the ability to sing a rousing song, and a reason to sing it, this is the first movie I've seen in some time where I walked out thinking, ""I have to get the sound track from this picture!"" Not saying there wasn't a few slow spots along the way, for the most part this was a fine feel-good show. How refreshing not to be sujected to creatures, crashes, monsters or mayhem. If you like a movie with a positive attitude and if you like music that sets you bopping about in your seat, you're going to like this one. I did.",/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2012,TxMike,," If you like singing and cute teenagers, you might enjoy this movie.
","It doesn't have a very high rating, probably for good reason because story-wise, it is mediocre. But the story is just there to allow the actors to sing, and they do very often and very well.",/review/rw2636683/?ref_=tt_urv
