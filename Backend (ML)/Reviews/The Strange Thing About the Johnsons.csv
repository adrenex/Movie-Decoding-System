24 July 2019,charliemaddocks,8," Groundbreaking
","For a debut short, they don't get much better than this. Original idea, well written, well acted, directed well and looked gorgeous shot on silky 16mm. Aswell as that the clothes and locations really summed up suburban america so well which really aided the storyline and made us really consider the idea of what goes on behind seemingly perfect closed doors...",/review/rw5048372/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2020,triton_ogletree,10," So...this exists...
","If you saw Hereditary or Midsommar or both, well here's where the director started and boy is it messed up! The 30 minute film is very well done but the concept will boggle your mind. This film is DEFINITELY not for everyone. It is an interesting perspective that I have never seen on film before but be warned it is quite disturbing. Fortunately for me, I am a big fan of disturbing films. If you are not, you should probably avoid this one.",/review/rw5048372/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2011,drezdock,10," Blown away!
","I was amazed at this movie! It was not at all what I expected it to be. The production values, cinematography, acting, writing, directing, and editing were absolutely phenomenal. Most of the other reviewers here have given it a low rating due to how uneasy the subject material made them. One even goes so far as to say ""the content of this project is not only disgusting, but implausible and completely ridiculous."" However the very next line in the review is ""I know these things actually happen,"" So how can something be both implausible and ridiculous, yet actually happen? This movie is great. It is thought provoking and I think does a good good of presenting an often uncontemplated take on the dark motifs the movie explores. It is designed to make the audience uncomfortable so that, hopefully, they will talk about what they have just watched. My hat goes off to the filmmaker and all those involved for creating a truly unique and visionary piece of cinema.",/review/rw5048372/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2021,ronnievanrijswijk,7," Talking about daddy issues
","I'm not the kind of person to get easily disturbed by watching movies or shorts with the ""disturbing"" label on it, and this is one of those rare films that actualy managed to freak me out. I won't spoil anything but you've never seen any disfunctional family themed films like this one, it's very original. It's also quite horrifying to actualy think that something like what you witness in this short could happen in real life, if you like well made original short films which leave you gasping in terror have a look at ""The Strange Thing About the Johnsons.",/review/rw5048372/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2021,midnitepantera,7," Super Disturbing! :O

10 February 2016,Horst_In_Translation,6," Absurd at first, tragic at last
","""The Strange Thing About the Johnsons"" is a half-hour live action short film from five years ago that features a predominantly Black cast. I have no idea why this is classified as a comedy, but there is certainly nothing to laugh in this little movie, also no black humor. It is about a seemingly harmonic family, but reality is different. The family's son has been abusing the father sexually since his teenage days. This also brings up the question of realism. Is it really justification enough for the father not to talk to parents or a psychologist because he was so ashamed? I am not sure. Anyway, the longer the film runs, the more dramatic it becomes. It needs a bit to really capture your interest, but at some point it succeeds and becomes a pretty devastating watch (in a positive sense). The writer and director is Ari Aster and this is one of his earliest career efforts. Sure shows that he has some talent, some of the greats in terms of filmmaking had worse rookie efforts. I recommend this half hour. Thumbs up.",/review/rw5048372/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2015,calvinherrmann,10," A Short Film Masterpiece.
","Let's be real here... Short films don't really have a place in the world in terms of global mass media. They are usually only seen by film-aholics or by people involved in the film arena (directors, producers, cinematographers, film critics, film students & professors, etc.) Ask any 'normal person' who doesn't know who David Lynch is, or doesn't have a strong opinion on the films of Hitchcock, if they can name just ONE short film... And I'd bet a million bucks they can't. name. one. My point is...",/review/rw5048372/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2019,TuesdayThe17th,7," For Aster fans only
","This is a very good first impression from recently acclaimed new director, Ari Aster. I would call him a horror director, however, based off the core nature of his films and some things Aster has said himself including things like he didn't intentionally set out to make a horror film from the start with ""Hereditary"". Ari Aster crafts heavy, haunting, and personal dramas that have a way of creating their very own unique atmosphere. An atmosphere usually filled with gut wrenching terror. ""The Strange Thing About the Johnsons"" is just that. This is Aster's most genre film as it feels almost 100% a drama. It is reminiscent of another anthology drama/horror called ""Family Portraits"" they are both very disturbing in their nature. ""The Strange Thing"" is the story about a suburban family that where the father and son share a dark secret. The story is very engaging as it is subject matter most of us have not seen portrayed in film before. This movie also kind of reminds me of Trey Edward Shults first film ""Krisha"". Overall a nice little short film to watch for fans of ""Hereditary"" and ""Midsommar""",/review/rw5048372/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2018,timcrouch-69926,10," A Nightmare For the Whole Family
","""The Strange Thing About the Johnsons"" is a short film that employs psychological realism to tell a story for the sole purpose of shocking, offending, and frightening the audience. Horror movies do that. It's sort of like comedies trying to make people laugh. This movie succeeds brilliantly in shocking, offending, and frightening the audience so I have to say ""well done"" to the nasty little creep who wrote and directed it. Well done, Ari Aster. Please make lots more horror movies. I love them. Later, you might want to get some therapy",/review/rw5048372/?ref_=tt_urv

4 December 2022,Jeremy_Urquhart,7," It's a lot to handle
","So on Letterboxd, this is listed as a comedy drama. I'd really have to disagree about the comedy part- unless you find the disturbing story absurd enough to be funny? But I don't really know who would, because the premise is one I genuinely don't feel like I can describe if I want to post this review on Letterboxd/IMDb/Instagram.",/review/rw5048372/?ref_=tt_urv

11 August 2022,mudtitan,8," Well, the Johnsons sure are strange...
","Talk about a thrilling short film! ""The Strange Thing about the Johnsons"" is probably the most intense short I've seen. Even disturbing from the opening shots, the first twist is a jaw-dropping shock for anyone who doesn't know the plot of the film.",/review/rw5048372/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have read allot of different reviews about this short; most negative. People either have an issue about content, the race of the family (Black), or both. Allot of them contain spoilers... Lets get this out the way, the movie is very disturbing; but its very original. Originally is something you don't see these days with movie studios appearing to only be pushing movies with existing IP's. "" Good acting, writing, and again an original story.

23 April 2022,dannylee-78082,7," Disturbing film, but well worth the watch.
","This film is one of Ari Aster's first films, debuted in 2011. Ever since even 10 years ago, he knew how to disturb the viewers. I've watched hereditary and midsommar and both were equally disturbing. This film as well.",/review/rw5048372/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2022,rokutvsarecool,8," Most traumatizing movie I have ever seen
","Now, I have seen all sorts of horror films, and films to raise awareness, but I know this isn't even meant to be a horror film. I am 14 and petrified, I have no idea if the mov is rated TV-MA, but it should be. Several accounts of SA are present in this film and the worst part of it was that this movie could be anyones true story, but thank goodness this wasn't actually based on something that happened because I would cry my eyes out. The part where the father walks in on his son is just the 2nd worst part of it all, and the part in the bathtub is just by far the worst. The incest, abuse, and the SA, and I didn't finish it but I read about murder, is just something that should never be watched, although it IS a good plot and I appreciate the work that went into this movie. I feel incredibly sorry for the actors.",/review/rw5048372/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2019,alyssa257,7," Too many people not seeing the deeper meaning!!!!
","It seems people are insulted by the film because he casted a black family. I've seen many people also say something along the lines of, ""why didn't he use a different race"" as if that would justify everything (and I'm guessing they wanted it to be a white family).",/review/rw5048372/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2022,jon_pratt12345,7," Highly disturbing and stays with you
","A short film about a seemingly unremarkable family with a disturbing secret. Ari Aster's first film and, for those familiar with his work, it packs the kind of unsettling punch we've come to expect. At its centre is a subject matter too horrible to really imagine anyone putting on film and it stayed with me for weeks afterwards as I struggled to get my head around it. I would recommend this short only to those with a high tolerance for the darkest story telling.",/review/rw5048372/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2017,Quinoa1984,5," yeah... no.
","Todd Solondz wannabe short film that may or may not be a satire or melodrama or both about rape in the family. On a positive note, the actor who played the father was quite good. Everyone else were quite poor in comparison, and the father was the closest to a fleshed out character (mostly the son, the mom's passable, but it's whoever the trying-but-tone-deaf son that sinks a lot of major dramatic scenes. And... yeah, I got nothing.",/review/rw5048372/?ref_=tt_urv

","Ari Aster had gradually made a name for himself in the terms of the horror genre with his next film Midsommar coming after his 2018 directorial debut Hereditary. Before either, Aster had made several short films that would come to define his style. His most well-known short film is a little piece called The Strange Thing About the Johnsons.",/review/rw5048372/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,beatrice_gangi,8," Ari loves his family drama
","The Strange Thing About the Johnsons is the short submitted by Ari Aster for his thesis, this before he established himself as one of the most talented directors in the contemporary horror film scene. Indeed, one of the most compelling things about the film is to note how several of the elements that made his best-known films outstanding were already part of his poetics from the very beginning. Among them, the propensity to tackle really taboo subjects, so much so that the idea must have been frowned upon in a politically correct university, such as AFI. So yes, Ari Aster's university professors most certainly hated him.",/review/rw5048372/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2021,bhollidaybaldock,8," well...that was something

8 August 2019,anadani98,10," The definition of disturbing
","It would be weird and alarming to say I liked it. I didn't. But not because someone does not like a movie means it's not good. This short film is a masterpiece. It disturbed me and made me feel uncomfortable from start to finish. And I'm sure that was Aster's aim. It's brilliant, it's genius and it assured me once again that us humans are just vile monsters who don't deserve life as free as it is. I'm certain this happens around a lot and that's the scariest fact.",/review/rw5048372/?ref_=tt_urv
