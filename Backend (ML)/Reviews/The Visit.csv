10 August 2005,MaxBorg89,7," SO stupid,but SO funny!
","I have to admit it,the plot (2 guys not remembering what they did the night before and ending up in an intergalactic crisis)is every bit as ridiculous as it sounds,but the truth is, for some twisted reason , I like this movie. If people don't like this kind of stuff,why did they choose to watch it in the first place?",/review/rw0718891/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2006,sweet_angelhugs,9," Shibby-est Movie Ever!!!
","Of all the stupid (yet funny) movies out there, ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" is definitely one of the funniest.",/review/rw0718891/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2017,inkblot11,7," Before the Hangover series, there was Dude; funny but crude
","Jesse (Ashton Kutcher) and Chester (Seann William Scott) are stoner roommates with a huge problem. Unhappily, they cannot remember what happened the night before and their sorry-state-of-a-car is gone. As they go through the day, they try to piece together what happened. First, they know there was a party at their twin girlfriends' (Jennifer Garner and Marla Sokoloff) house, something which has ticked off the gals mightily as the abode is trashed. J and C realize they must make it up to these ladies, as it is their anniversary and the girls have promised a ""sweet reward"" if they come bearing gifts. But, other events in their ""lost"" day include a trip to a strip club, a major theft of funds by the lads, an encounter with a weird group waiting for aliens, and more. In fact, the nutsy group believes Jesse and Chester have stolen a magic device from the aliens that they would like back. There are others trailing the dudes, very angry about matters the lads can't remember. Can these two airheads get things squared away with everyone and move on? Can they find their car? This funny but crude film will make some laugh, others cringe. But, in truth, the Hangover owes a huge debt to the basic premise of the movie; weird events go down when you are too ""out of it"" to know what you are doing. Kutcher and Scott are terrific as the intelligence-challenged dudes and the rest of the cast if great, too. The script delivers some bonafide guffaws while the direction is lively. If you want mindless entertainment, Dude certainly bestows it.",/review/rw0718891/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2003,rbverhoef,7," Stupid, but funny
","I can understand when you think this movie is total crap. I can also understand when you think this movie is pretty darn funny. I agree with the last opinion. With this movie, they don't make them more stupid than this, I had a great time. There are some really good laughs and the stupid things are so stupid I just had to smile.",/review/rw0718891/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2010,Pumpkin_Man,10," Incredibly Funny!!!
","It had been a long been a long time since I watched this movie, and it's still very funny and awesome to me. I forgot about a couple of things. Two stoners with hangovers named Jesse and Chester wake up and can't remember anything about what happened the previous night. They receive a phone call from their angry girlfriends on their anniversary and try to find the gifts that they had gotten them. When they realize it's in a car that's nowhere to be found. Throughout the day, they must deal with hot chicks, creepy space dorks, look for the Continuum Transfunctioner, find the money for a transsexual stripper and much more. I have just one question; DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR?!!!",/review/rw0718891/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2005,craigman,8," What the hell is WRONG with all you people?!?
","This movie is funny, period. Everyone I know (and like) that saw it thought it was hilarious, including me. I don't understand what people were expecting when they saw this! It was a thousand times funnier than any recent Ben Stiller ""comedy"". There are at least a dozen scenes that made me laugh out loud. The couple of people that actually wrote a good review for this said that it was so stupid that it was funny. Well, I don't think it was any stupider than most of the unfunny ""comedies"" that have come out lately...And a lot of people compared the to ""Bill and Ted"". Why? It was nothing like ""Bill and Ted"", except for maybe there were 2 male leads, like countless other buddy comedies. You people are just... WRONG!",/review/rw0718891/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2000,dr_hollygoodhead,8," Stupid, yet entertaining...
","I love stupid movies... I live for them, in fact, and this was definitely stupid.  Spend the $5, go see it for yourself!  If you weren't interested in it, you probably wouldn't be looking at reviews in the first place unless you're a concerned parent (let your kids see it, it's not too bad), or if you hated it and wanted to see if anyone actually enjoyed it.  I did, and I recommend it to anyone who just wants to laugh at the antics of two total stoners.  Personally, I think a different ending could have made this movie a lot more enjoyable, but I don't want to give it away, so see it for yourself.  This one won't win any awards (with a name like ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" one wouldn't expect it to be a contender, anyway), but for all of us who have had a ""night to remember"" that we forgot, it's damn funny.",/review/rw0718891/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2020,mitsubishizero,7," It's enjoyably dumb
","This isn't fine art. What did you expect from this stoner comedy? It's enjoyably dumb. Two dimwits (Ashton Kutcher and Sean William Scott) wake up forgetting what they did yesterday. To do this they retrace their steps. This sets them on a bizarre adventure. From dealing with aliens, their girlfriends, a cult and an annoying Chinese woman who only ask ""and then""?",/review/rw0718891/?ref_=tt_urv

24 June 2001,sparrtacus,10," Lighten up, people!
","""Dude"" is by no means an intelligent movie, nor does it want to be one. However, it is treated as one by the public. If you don't like stupid movies, why did you go see it anyway!? I mean, personally, I love stupid movies. American Pie, Idle Hands, Evolution- all genius. But if you see any of them thinking you are going to get an intelligent comedy the problem lies within you and your lack of a sense of humor.",/review/rw0718891/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2000,Quinoa1984,7," Definitely better than I expected
","This film to me is like Dumb and Dumber with as teen mix.  It is complete dumb, silly fun and like most dumb, silly fun, I found it funny.  This film could've turned really dumb though and not turned funny, but it is.  The story (as smart as a cork) has 2 teens who need to find the one kids car (Ashton Kutcher as the one and the other one is Seann William Scott) with their girlfriend's and alien existence in the balance.  A funny comedy, one of the best ones of the year, even if there are a few flaws.  Favorite scene: a guy is working at a blind kids camp where he gets repeatedly hit in the genitals.

30 November 2003,JacFlash,," Why, Oh Why Do I Like This Movie??
","I appreciate a good film, I dig Citizen Kane, Kubrick, David Lynch..etc. There should be no feasable reason that I find this movie appealing, yet I do!  I'm not a moron, but this dumb, dumb, movie is so watchable it's a crime not to grab a tub of popcorn, a couple beers and dumb out for an hour and a half and see this one. You'll lose a few IQ points on the way, but it's worth it.",/review/rw0718891/?ref_=tt_urv

28 March 2020,bevo-13678,10," Outstanding
","Every now and then a masterpiece like this comes along to restore your faith in the cinematic art. Truly a breath of fresh air from the derivative, brainless Hollywood trash we have become accustomed to. This movie contains spot on acting, sophisticated humour (the sweet/dude tattoo gag had me in stitches) and pin point direction. That plus a compelling story line, the likes we haven't seen since Weekend at Bernies, will make this film go down in history as one of the classics. BRAVO!!!",/review/rw0718891/?ref_=tt_urv

10 August 2006,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,9," Excellent comedy about two potheads!
","DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR?, in my opinion, is an excellent comedy about two potheads! If you ask me, Jesse (Ashton Kutcher) and Chester (Seann William Scott) were very funny, even though they were potheads. In addition, all of their mishaps were hilarious. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was ideally cast, the direction was flawless, the production design was spectacular, and the performances were top-grade. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent comedy about two potheads. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Oh, yes, and don't use drugs.",/review/rw0718891/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2005,lee_eisenberg,5," This proves that movies can be stupid and funny at the same time
","My 5/10 rating is because, like any Bill & Ted movie, ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" is only targeted at a certain audience (in this case all the world's slackers). The plot - or whatever it is - of course has goof-ball stoners Jesse Montgomery III (Ashton Kutcher) and Chester Greenburg (Seann William Scott) searching for their car and having a most unusual adventure in the process. The point is that you shouldn't try to take this movie seriously; just accept it as nice stupid fun and you're sure to have a good time. Not a movie that you'll ever forget. If I remember right, Michael Moore even suggested that we should show it to Kim Jong Il in order to make peace between the two Koreas.",/review/rw0718891/?ref_=tt_urv

8 March 2015,Movie-ManDan,10," A Classic Stoner Movie For Almost Anyone!
","The only problem with Dude, Where's My Car? is that it deals with dumb burnouts. Unlike The Hangover or Cheech & Chong, Dude has virtually no offensive material. Sure there are sexual and drug references, but it's nothing that a little kid in kindergarten or first grade couldn't handle. Just having good parents is good enough. Knowing the way parents are today, it might be a bad idea.",/review/rw0718891/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2000,G-Man-25,," Totally Brainless Fun!
","This cheerfully brainless teen comedy is predictably crude and slapdash but also unpredictably funny.  Ashton Kutcher (""That 70s Show"") and Seann William Scott (Stifler in ""American Pie"") make an engaging pair of blissfully stoned-out, clueless slackers on a quest to find their missing car and make up with their girlfriends after waking up from a night of wild partying, of which they can't remember even ONE detail.  The day takes them on a series of misadventures as they try to retrace their steps the night before and meet with a bunch of bullies, babes, sci-fi cult members and other colorful characters.

2 March 2006,jlease-1,8," Duderific
","Highly entertaining the first 100 times I saw it, now not so much. The 'and then' segment at the drive thru entered my homes dialect and has not left yet. Hot chicks are sprinkled thru the movie, as well as the very disturbing she-male stripper. This movie is often thought of as the epitome of bad, but really it's funny enough. Is it formulaic? Sure. Is Ashton Kutcher a total tool? Kinda looks so. Seann William Scott is the funnier of the two by far. Great cameo appearance of Brent Spiner (knows as DATA on Star Trek Next Generation). The bubble wrap jumpsuits are also highly entertaining and original. I thought there was going to be a sequel to this, but it evidently fell thru.",/review/rw0718891/?ref_=tt_urv

They get up to go see their girlfriends and find that Jesse's car has gone missing, along with whatever anniversary gift they have for their ladies.

6 April 2011,rraa-dd,10," Incredibly hilarious
","How this is only rated at 5.1/10 and trash like The Hangover gets over 8.0/10 is beyond my understanding. As many people have pointed out, IMDb is becoming less reliable. Yes, this comedy is ""stupid"" (I don't actually like the way people on here use this adjective to describe the movie - too many negative connotations), or, as I like to put it, it is so light hearted it isn't supposed to be taken seriously at all. The plot simply proves it. But it is the ridiulousness of the plot and the fact that this would never happen to anyone in real life that make this move insanely funny. I mean, who didn't laugh at ""Dude, it's a llama!"", the ""And then"" scene, or ""My name is Zarnoff. This is Zabu, Zellnor, Zelbor, Zelmina, and, uh, Jeff.""? The movie is hilarious all the way through, there aren't any scenes that won't cause the watcher to stop laughing. If anyone wants to watch a real comedy movie, which does it's job of providing comedic entertainment, then ""Dude, where's my car?"" is the movie to watch. Although judging by the fact that people these days prefer to claim that Zach Galifianakis doing his typical ""Look at me, im fat, therefore im funny!"" is absolutely hilarious, this movie won't get the deserved rating and recognition, simply because people have a boring sense of humour.",/review/rw0718891/?ref_=tt_urv
