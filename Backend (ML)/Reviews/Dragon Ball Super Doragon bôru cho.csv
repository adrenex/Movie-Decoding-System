9 June 2005,mstomaso,6," Got all the basics of some challenging material right
","This film, and its generally poor reception is a good example of what happens when huge marketing mistakes are made. Take a look at the cover of the DVD package: ""Stallone: Judge Dredd"". The film should have been titled ""Judge Dredd"" - even in the packaging - and the emphasis for the marketing of this film should have been less Stallone, more content. On the flip-side, when the most consistent complaint you can find among IMDb psychofants is ""HE TOOK OFF HIS HELMET!"", you really have to wonder if the film is quite as bad as so many believe.

24 April 2001,mattymatt4ever,8," A damn good time at the movies!
","It's unfortunate that ""Judge Dredd"" wasn't accepted by mainstream viewers or even received a cult following.  I found it to be very entertaining.  I don't see too many movies based on comic book superheroes that I honestly enjoyed.  ""X Men"" for example went on too long, moved very slowly and took itself too seriously.  ""Judge Dredd"" is a fast-paced sci-fi-action thrill ride that delivers from start to finish and has help in the comic relief department by Rob Schneider.  Sylvester Stallone overacts throughout, but that's part of the fun.  Watching him scream out ""I AM THE LAW!!"" makes you want to scream it out along with him, which is what I do whenever I view this movie.  There are many quotable lines, which I enjoy reciting.  ""Judge Dredd"" is not a deeply intelligent, insightful film.  But it makes a great popcorn flick!  This upbeat, funny, nonstop entertainment is a real treat for me to watch over and over again.

25 April 2005,BrandtSponseller,8," Delivers thought-provoking action in a fantasy sci-fi wrapping
","Judge Dredd is based on one of the most popular characters from the UK's 2000 AD comics. It is set in the 22nd Century, when most of the Earth has been turned into a desolate wasteland known as the ""Cursed Earth"" and most humans live in highly concentrated cities, walled off from the rest of the world. Society is fairly anarchic, except there for a class of humans, known as ""judges"", who act as cop, judge, jury and executioner all rolled into one. Sylvester Stallone is the titular judge. He's notorious among the other judges, the general citizenry and the other judges for upholding the law in a harsh way. The film primarily tells the story arc from the comics known as ""The Return of Rico"", and concerns a plot to get Dredd into trouble while overthrowing what's left of the existing ""order"".",/review/rw1071855/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2003,bob the moo,," Standard blockbuster fare for people who like things that go bang  but not much more than that
","In the future the world has been scorched and is uninhabitable.  The cities are overflowing and cramped.  Violence and crime has gotten to the stages that the courts and juries of the past were unable to cope.  The Judges were planned to be police, judge and executioners  the ultimate law keepers. The strictest of these is Judge Dredd.  However Dredd's history is revealed when his long-forgotten genetic twin escapes from captivity and kills high ranking council members.  The DNA evidence points to Dredd and he is sentenced accordingly.  However he escapes with hacker Fergie and returns to the city to try and stop Rico's plan for his own laws.",/review/rw1071855/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2000,stamper,8," This is one great action flick
","This has got it all, the comic lines, the action, the story a perfect cast (especially Stallone, whom you could presume modelled for the comic character of Judge Dredd, Assante who makes a real cool bad guy and Schneider as the comic sidekick). This really never puts you back an inch, while you are on the edge of your seat. It is great, although I would have liked it bloodier (show how they rip Prochnow's arms and legs of and show how that human is barbecued). While I am at the bad stuff, I feel that the effects were pretty poor sometimes although that didn't bother me that much I still enjoyed it. What bothers me that at 93 minutes this film seems heavily cut, or why does the lab at the end just start exploding and why didn't I see one clone moving around. That's it, nope, the ending could have been better, but it is OK.",/review/rw1071855/?ref_=tt_urv

9 August 2016,Leofwine_draca,4," Big budget time waster
","More no-brain thrills and spills from Stallone, who found his popularity on the wane at around this period. On the strength of this film, I can't say I'm surprised, especially as scenes of Stallone walking around like a tree shouting ""I am the LAW!"" in a supposed-serious manner are frequently laughable and make you feel embarrassed for the actor. JUDGE DREDD is one of those movies that was possibly messed up in post-production, as the disjointed, fragmented narrative and frequently confusing action may testify to. Indeed in one scene we see a bloodless Stallone in action; in the next we see him running down a corridor bleeding profusely, suggesting that perhaps large chunks of the film were cut out due to negative audience reaction?

","In the future, most of the world has become a desolate wasteland. The population is crowded into Mega Cities. However these city states turn chaotic and a new law & order system is established. Judges become the new police, jury, and executioners. The strictest of them all is Judge Dredd (Sylvester Stallone). Meanwhile dangerous criminal Rico (Armand Assante) has escaped from the Aspen Penal Colony. Rico has a past with Dredd, and there is sinister plan afoot. Dredd is framed for murder.

18 June 2020,cardsrock,5," The Stallone Show
","I would hardly call this a Judge Dredd movie. While it starts off promising with an intriguing premise and great production design, the film quickly devolves into a typical Stallone action film. It's cliched, lacking in a good story, and missing something special. This is an interesting character that gets tossed aside pretty quickly so Stallone can take his helmet off and do his usual shtick. I don't dislike Stallone, but he seemed like an odd choice for this film.",/review/rw1071855/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2005,planktonrules,6," Does NOT suck as badly as you'd think
","Before this movie even premiered, critics almost universally panned it. Because of this, many made fun of the film and few went to see it (I was among them). However, a few years later, I saw it on cable TV (on a day I was too lazy to change the channel) and was shocked that I didn't hate the movie. While a little dopey at times, the movie kept my attention and surely didn't deserve all the bad press. Another Stallone movie that falls in the same category was Demolition Man. A decent film--and this is shocking since I am a film snob.",/review/rw1071855/?ref_=tt_urv

22 August 2003,solongsuckers,," Absolutely nothing original but shockingly good
","I'll preface this by saying that I have never read the Judge Dredd comic. That being said, I bashed this movie when my friends and I watched first watched it back in 1995 in the theater.  I am now throughly eating my words. This thing is amazingly good and entertaining throwaway cheese.  There is zero originality here.  This is Blade Runner meets Demolition Man meets Texas Chainsaw massacre meets Superman 2 meets Star Wars Trilogy.  This movie is almost a replica of Demolition Man but is tons more fun.  Stallone, like in Demolition Man, plays a supercop.  He's accused of a crime he didn't commit and is punished, like in Demolition Man.  There are other parallels along the way.  He meets a Texas Chainsaw Massacre family in his exile, with an android member who looks suspiciously like Terry Bradshaw.  Armand Assante is really great as the villain, Diane Lane excels in a role that doesn't fit her and Rob Schneider is stunningly endearing as the third wheel in a party of two.  Max Von Sydow and Jurgen Prochnow add their talents to give the movie a seasoned flavor.  Stallone's intro is pathetic but he excels along the way.  The digital effects also work themselves into the story very well.  I'm stunned at how good this thing is upon reviewing it.",/review/rw1071855/?ref_=tt_urv

3 January 2020,masonsaul,8," Ridiculous fun
","Judge Dredd is predictable but also fast paced, ridiculous fun that's also gleefully over the top. Sylvester Stallone and Armand Assante both give amazing over the top performances and plenty of perfect and cheesy one liners. Diane Lane, Max Von Sydow and Rob Schneider are all great. It also has solid production values and Danny Cannon's direction is really good. The music by Alan Silvestri is extremely bombastic and works perfectly.",/review/rw1071855/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2011,Tweekums,5," Okay but nowhere near as good as 'Demolition Man'
","In the nineties Sylvester Stallone made two films with remarkable similar plots: 'Judge Dredd' and 'Demolition Man'. In both he plays an enforcer of the law in the future, in both a corrupt official releases a particularly dangerous criminal from a maximum security prison and in both he has a race to defeat his foe before he can release even more danger unfortunately the two films are not of equal quality and this is by far the weaker of the two. Stallone plays the eponymous Judge Dredd; a man who rigidly upholds the letter of the law until one day he finds himself sentenced for a murder he didn't commit. The DNA evidence seems irrefutable but he doesn't know he and the perpetrator are clones! The other clone is Rico, a man who has no respect for Dredd's beloved law. As Dredd is being transported to jail the transport shuttle is shot down and he and a petty criminal called Fergie are the sole survivors, they are captured by a group of cannibals but manage to escape and returned to the walled Mega City where they must confront Rico.",/review/rw1071855/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2004,dolemite72,10," Highly under-rated
","Years ago, in 2000AD, they held a poll to which who could play JUDGE DREDD. With this poll taking place in 1980-81, most readers voted for CHARLES BRONSON or JAMES COBURN. To be true, either BRONSON or COBURN had the 'DREDD' look, but were getting on a bit, in years. Finally after many legal wrangles, the movie got made in 1995, and SYLVESTER STALLONE was picked to play the futuristic lawman. Once made, the fans picked holes in the movie. DREDD takes his helmet off (the fans could not forgive this) but allow Hollywood, a certain 'artistic licence'. Obviously STALLONE had to show his face (if only in the scenes were he's incarcerated, unlike the 2000AD 'JUDGE CALIGULA' stories, whereas he was bandaged up, due to a snipers wound) Now nearly ten years on, the movie is still fresh, the effects still special, and STALLONE still shines (despite what people say, STALLONE is the only 'tough-guy' i'd want to see play DREDD, right down to the comic-book 'snare') Every performance is great in this movie (especially MAX VON SYDOW) and director DANNY CANNON has come in for a lot of misguided flack. And it's also good to see that other minor 2000AD elements have been kept intact. The 'ANGEL FAMILY' are exactly as i remember them in the comics, and the set design, is MEGA-CITY-ONE come to life. So for those, who are to geeky to accept a little change, just imagine, that JUDGE DREDD had been made in 2004. DREDD would be played by either VIN DIESEL or THE ROCK..........Holly drok!!!!!",/review/rw1071855/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2006,matt19007,8," Classic Stallone action movie.
","Firstly, I am not a reader of the Judge Dredd comic books, so I have nothing to compare Stallone's Judge Dredd to, but honestly, I loved this movie and cannot imagine any other actor playing this role. I've heard people say that Dredd should not remove his helmet, but that did not bother me one bit. The action in the movie ranks along side some of Stallone's best and the movie is entertaining from start to finish. I think that Rico is a good villain, played to perfection by Armand Assante and Diane Lane is superb as Judge Hershey, providing all of the emotion and human qualities that are devoid from Judge Dredd, therefore intensifying the character of Dredd. Fergie is also a good character, played well by Rob Schneider who creates a sense of humour, making the film not just about raw action. Judge Dredd, as a popcorn movie is superb, it was never going to win Oscars, but at the end of the day, that is not the point of the film. It is intended to be pure Stallone-fuelled entertainment and on this level it is a resounding success.",/review/rw1071855/?ref_=tt_urv

17 September 2004,filmbuff1970,9," More Fun Than Xmen 2 or Spiderman 2
","This movie is far more fun than the boring Xmen 2 or Spiderman 2. Why simply because it does not have a hero constantly whining about being a super hero. The whole point of a super hero is he is super. I don't need a action movie to have less action and more character study. Action movies should entertain not bore the pants off people. I want my heroes to be like heroes, not ones that could do with a slap. This is fast paced and one of the best action movies of 1995, just compare it to Waterworld, Batman Forever and Die Hard with a vengeance. This is superior to those movies yet flopped. If Schwarzenegger had been in this it would of done well, but Stallone movies never got a fair review. The Special FX are superior to the awful Playstation 2 cgi rubbish we get now. It's a real shame there wont be a sequel.",/review/rw1071855/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2005,mentalcritic,2," Judge Dreddful...
","I just finished reading a comment with the headline ""Not all that bad! They should've edited to PG-13 though for more audience members!"". I really do not think this author has really seen Judge Dredd, because the idea that this film could not pass the MPAA with a PG-13 certificate is one of the most telling signs that the censoring of film has gone too far in America. Indeed, this conception of Judge Dredd is so watered down you could almost cuddle up to it in your sleep. The sins of this film are numerous and heavy, but by far the worst is the attempt it makes to please everyone. That old saying about trying to please everybody and winding up pleasing nobody as a result was invented for a reason. Sadly, film executives once again misinterpreted this as a sign that our films need to be more censored and watered down in order to appeal to everyone. If only they could realise that the varying nature of individual taste means that there is never going to be a film that everyone in the world will pay to see twice.",/review/rw1071855/?ref_=tt_urv
