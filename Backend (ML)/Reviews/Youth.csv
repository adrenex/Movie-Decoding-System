28 February 2002,artzau,," Great Movie and hey, THEY CAN ACT!
","This is NOT a chick flick.  True, it is rife with sentiment but is not sentimental.  It pushes the envelope in several ways but the thing that really gets me is how much better these English actors and writers are than we are.  I shudder to imagine what pablum (e.g., Ghost) would have come out of Hollywood.  The humor and imagination that has gone into this film is amazing and then, there's the Bach.  I mean, listening to Bach on the cello is worth the price of admission in itself.  The little bits and pieces of how a shattered life is put together is touching but never maudlin.  The ghosts who are always cold (well, I mean they're dead, aren't they?) and who are hooked on videos of classic movies (OK.  Is it High Noon or Fitzcarraldo?) is great.  If you can watch the closing scenes without chocking up and getting at least a little teary, you are made of pretty stern stuff.  I love this film and highly recommend you see.  I plan to watch it again and again...",/review/rw6224725/?ref_=tt_urv

","Now, I like a weepy, I'm not ashamed to admit it. I actively seek out those films that are most likely to make me cry. However, more often than not, I end up disappointed because usually this type of film is either wildly melodramatic or painfully sentimental.",/review/rw6224725/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2005,cinemaniac2002,10," The Thinking Person's ""Ghost""
","Writer-director Anthony Minghella is best known for rather large-budget literary film adaptations such as ""The English Patient,"" (which garnered the Best Director Oscar) and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley."" That is all the more reason to check out his first effort behind the camera. Originally produced for BBC television, ""Truly Madly Deeply"" genuinely demonstrates Minghella's meticulous touch with character relationships. ",/review/rw6224725/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 1999,Megabuck,8," Tears, snot, pain - what a wonderful film
","Having spent some time in the States, I got to watch the brilliant review programme starring Siskel and Ebert (rest in peace, Gene). I've now got a rather dated copy of Ebert's book, and his review of this film matches my opinions perfectly.",/review/rw6224725/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2003,jennifer-137,," touching portrait of a real relationship
","This is a beautiful little movie. Juliet Stevenson (as Nina) plays one of the most authentic female leads I've ever seen: She bawls full-out, complete with fluids; she looks like a man in bad lighting; she's passive aggressive and irritable and loveable and likeable and real. Likewise, Alan Rickman's character, Jamie, is peevish, like all of us, self-centered, like all of us, but beautiful and unique and again, real. Unlike the schmaltz we're fed here in the states, where dialogue consists of rehearsed speeches (think Jerry Maguire) and love seems skin-deep, this is a couple that seems not only to love each other but to genuinely like each other; a couple that has their own language, as long-term couples do (and it's not translated, which is so refreshing), a couple that can be silly with each other and irritated with each other within minutes; that can have spats that are not high drama or the beginning of the end or anything other than the end of a long day in a too-hot apartment. The ending broke my heart yet seemed like the most natural and right course of action. Truly stunning.",/review/rw6224725/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2006,ALauff,9," Isolation

18 February 2006,playwrite2000,10," Not ""Ghost""
","Anthony Minghella, the film director, is a sneaky guy. He sets up ""Truly, Madly, Deeply"" as a 3 hankie weeper as Juliet Stevenson mourns the death of her young husband, inadvertently asphyxiated by an endo tube after getting ""a sore throat"". She isolates herself from her friends, gets snappy with well meaning relatives, bawls at the first cords of an overheard cello (hubby played one and she accompanied him on the piano), and winds up on a therapist's couch. Ah, she had such a sweet, caring, satisfying relationship with this talented, intelligent, good looking man. How tragic that his unfulfilled life should be cut so callously short leaving this truly wonderful woman bereft and in despair. So, here we are, the audience, blowing our noses, wiping our eyes, feeling her loss and wondering ourselves how we would handle such a dreadful event. We think of the lovers, spouses, children in our lives. How close and intimate we are with them and how close all of us are to being summoned by the Grim Reaper without notice. Our sympathies are totally with this grieving young woman. Imagine our glee when out of nowhere the decedent appears, back from the beyond, in the flesh. Amazing. We vicariously feel the thrill the wife feels as she leaps into his arms, madly embracing the man she thought she'd lost forever. He's back. All of him... and there's Minghella's rub. It soon becomes evident that the husband has returned, not to haunt her or torment her, but only to be himself and with a totally unexpected agenda. He returns with his good habits (they play the word games they always used to pass the time with, they frolic, they joke and laugh and look deep into each other's eyes) but he also brings along his bad traits, and it's difficult accommodating oneself to his pushy, egotistic behavior, even if he is a ghost. Patrick Sweazy made a back-from-the-dead flick (""Ghost"") where he hovered over Demi Moore and made her widowhood bearable. She always knew he was there. And what a wonderful guy he was. Sweetness and light. But TMD is no ""Ghost"". Menghella says, instead, wait a minute. The one we grieve for was a multi-dimensional person. How soon we forget the bad and glorify the good. After the ""honeymoon"" is over, the widow in his movie begins to feel a bit crowded. Her husband's always complaining about how cold the flat is, turning up the heat, sneezing from the drafts, shoving up against her in bed with his clammy body. He's learned Spanish but his accent is atrocious. He brings back some ""friends"" with him, a motley crew, all polite, but given to watching videos (""I Vitelloni"", ""Hannah and Her Sisters"") at all hours of the day and night. The husband rearranges the furniture. Then, she meets a wonderful man in a restaurant. He works with the disabled and does magic tricks. He wants to date her. She's attracted to him. But what does she do with the living dead hubby at home? How can she entertain anyone? Must her life now accommodate his death? Her therapist is noncomittal. The denouement is absolutely spot on.",/review/rw6224725/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2006,isabelle1955,," Truly My Favorite
","If I'm ever forced to compile a list of my all time favourite top five movies, it will vary from week to week  maybe even day to day  and certainly depend upon my current mood and degree of cynicism. But I'm absolutely certain that Truly Madly Deeply will always be in there. I simply love this film. (And hate the version that Hollywood made of it, Ghost.) I watched it again recently, and it was like visiting an old friend. I must have seen this film 10 times yet I seem to be able to glean something extra from it every time. To me, that is the mark of a real work of art, to be able to revisit it and find something new; to still be moved even though the work is familiar.",/review/rw6224725/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2005,SataiDelen,10," Truly Madly Deeply A Wonderful Movie!!!
","I didn't catch this movie until it came out on cable. I don't know what I was expecting but I wasn't expecting what I saw. I cried and cried and laughed and cried from beginning to end! Alan Rickman is just the most wonderful actor. He is so talented at EVERYTHING he does! When he kissed Juliet Stevenson my heart pounded and my breath caught in my throat. It was such a beautiful, tender, loving, and yet still passionate kiss and so therefore believable of two people who loved each other so much. What I got out of this movie is the need to be able to grieve, but the necessity of being able to move on with your life while still accepting that someone you love is dead but not gone and knowing that you will always love the person you leave behind while learning that it's OK to live your life and find new love. This movie has become one of my all-time favorite movies. If you have not seen it yet, you MUST see it!",/review/rw6224725/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2005,George-441,8," Unusual and moving movie
","This one of the most memorable and touching movies about love and loss that I have ever seen. It does fall a little into the trite towards the end with some of the side plots, but the essential message is there from beginning to end. There are people who you love who leave deep and indelible pieces in you, but the essence of living is painful and individual.",/review/rw6224725/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2005,niteotaku,10," A lovely examination of grief and grieving.
","A nice look at what it means to lose someone, and to be the lost as well. All too often (as in the treacly ""Ghost"") we are treated to a fantasy version of love and loss, where you get to have your cake (looking fab in that graveside outfit) and eat it too (dead person is wonderfully available as he guides you to your next, even better for you, love). Here, we see a woman who cannot let go, who is so paralyzed with grief she cannot live the life left to her. The man she lost untimely loves her so dearly he returns, not to take up where they left off (which is all she asks), but to guide her back into life, life he can never have again. What makes this movie admirable is the deft and sensitive rendering of the act of letting go, from both the point of view of the lost and the living.",/review/rw6224725/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2016,SnoopyStyle,8," Juliet Stevenson brilliant
","Nina (Juliet Stevenson)'s life is a mess. Her apartment is falling apart and infested with rats. In her interpreter job, her boss can't speak Spanish and therefore needs her help to communicate with his son. She gets hit on by various men in her life but she can't act on them. She is still heart-broken with the lost of her love Jamie (Alan Rickman). She speaks with him and then actually directly interacts with him. It starts out as overwhelming love rekindling turns into the old problems resurfacing once again.",/review/rw6224725/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2005,Celebrian65,8," Didn't come off as ""hokey""...
","A man who comes back as a ghost to assist his grieving wife... it could have been really cheesy, but Rickman and Stevenson pull it off! I loved this movie and I'm not normally into romantic comedies. The comedy is subtle and doesn't dominate the movie. If you're looking for a happy-go-lucky, laugh a minute movie, look elsewhere. Stevenson's tears and grief are very realistic and you truly feel her desperation. Yet, though there is sadness and even the ending is bitter-sweet, you don't leave feeling depressed and there ARE laughs along the way. Rickman and Stevenson's singing scene is tremendous and a must see for all Rickman fans! It is strange to call a movie about a ghost ""realistic"", but it is. The relationship between the two leads is very realistic and the chemistry is incredible. All in all a charming little flick to watch when you feel like cuddling up and watching a good love story.",/review/rw6224725/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2004,Pamsanalyst,10," Not a chick flick, necessarily

",This film is truly (madly and deeply) one of my top 10 of all time. It shows an honest portrayal of what life must be like for someone whose lover has died.

","Excellent ghost/love story steeped in common sense with fine performances and believable characters. Juliet Stevenson plays a great Nina and her expressions of grief over losing her lover broke my heart, so when you watch this very entertaining film, I strongly suggest you keep an extra box of tissues by your side. I enjoyed this fine film quite a bit and I hope you do as well.",/review/rw6224725/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2000,Q-Man,10," A wonderful film
","I saw this film on my local public broadcasting station and was mesmerized. The lead actress was incredible. I could feel her sense of loss, and even betrayal, at the death of her partner. Her depression and withdrawal from the real world were totally believable. His reappearance and was a great plot devise for allowing her to regain her sense of self. The second time this came on, I watched it again (it is rare for me to see a film twice) and made certain that my partner watched it with me this time. It touched real emotions that someone who has experienced loss can completely understand.",/review/rw6224725/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2004,diva-25,10," Simply Sweetly Beautifully
","This film is truly remarkable. It's seemingly effortlessly acted by a stellar cast including the always fabulous Alan Rickman and Juliet Stevenson. Minghella developed this originally as a radio play (his others include the excellent ""Cigarettes and Chocolate""), and here it is excellently adapted for the screen and directed by Minghella. Alan Rickman is never disappointing, but his turn as Jamie is truly surprising and beautiful. Usually cast as a villain, he is so excellent in this very endearing role. Juliet Stevenson is equally good, and the two of them have excellent chemistry. The film is never better than in the scenes between the two of them. It cannot really be compared to GHOST based purely on subject matter. This film is infinitely more intelligent and engaging. Do NOT miss it. You can buy the DVD from Amazon for under $12! Don't miss it - you'll want to watch it again and again with the one you love. And if you pick up the DVD you get Minghella's commentary.",/review/rw6224725/?ref_=tt_urv

25 August 2012,Leofwine_draca,7," Unique take on the afterlife
","Watching TRULY MADLY DEEPLY is something of a refreshing experience after sitting through the umpteenth supernatural thriller about vengeful spirits. This film offers different kinds of ghost altogether, where the afterlife is depicted as a kind of extremely dull limbo where the spirits of the dead can't fully interact with life as they knew it.",/review/rw6224725/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2020,lee_eisenberg,10," the memories will stay
","Anthony Minghella's ""Truly, Madly, Deeply"" drew a number of comparisons to ""Ghost"". While both focus on the presence of a deceased lover, ""Truly, Madly, Deeply"" looks more at the characters' relationships. Not just between the woman (Juliet Stevenson) and her deceased lover (Alan Rickman), but also between her and her other acquaintances. To be certain, the woman has friends from outside the country, and it looks as though the English people don't consider them ""truly"" English.",/review/rw6224725/?ref_=tt_urv
