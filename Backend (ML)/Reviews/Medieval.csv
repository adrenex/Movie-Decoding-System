","This is an absolutely brilliant series with superb acting! We are fans of British crime shows & are ecstatic that there will be a season 3. I have been a Nicola Walker fan since MI5, and to see how she has perfected her craft is quite amazing. Bravo!",/review/rw6757696/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2015,ianlouisiana,10," Nice and easy does it......
","There are two ways the first episode of a new cop show can go. Bull at a gate - like the excellent ""No Offence"" or nice and easy. ""Unforgotten"" goes the second route.Introducing the characters,apparently disparate but clearly in some way connected.Then providing the catalyst - in this case the body of a young man murdered over thirty five years ago that sparks the action. The excellent Miss N.Walker is the CID officer who decides to investigate this cold case and her team quickly discovers the identity of the victim thanks to a car key found with the body. This is for a hand - made sports model which they eventually track down to a scrap yard.The car looks suspiciously like an MGB roadster to me but I guess you could hardly expect the BBC to custom build one just to scrap it. The police find a diary in the car and the story is off and running at just the right stage - the end of the first episode. Interestingly we know more about the suspects' personal lives that we do about the detective's.She is living with that nice Mr P Egan;and that's about it so far. Contrastingly we know Mr T.Courtenay is wheelchair - bound with a wife suffering from Dementia and Mr T Eve is a menacing figure(what else?) with a dodgy past. There is a nice middle - aged couple whose son tragically died that are so lovely they must be guilty of something by the first rule of TV cop shows. All these people are about to have their lives blown apart as the redoubtable Miss Walker investigates. I shall look forward to seeing what she finds out about them and what we find out about her.",/review/rw6757696/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2015,gmorgan51-158-682165,9," Touching and honest
","I am really blown away by this series. The writing is excellent, and, as a lover of mysteries, the plot is riveting. Each episode builds on the previous episode. The chronology of events and the characters make sense. Notwithstanding dramatic license, the people seem real, with strengths and weaknesses we can all recognize and relate to. The acting is phenomenal.",/review/rw6757696/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2018,thegulls1,9," Nicola Walker rocks!
","We enjoyed Ms. Walker in Spooks (Mi5) and River. She seems ageless. In some of her roles, she look like your aunt, while sometimes being very pretty (I mean that in a good way). In this entry, she leads a homicide team checking out, in the first two seasons, 2 separate cold cases. We get to know Nicola's character, and most others quite well (a Hallmark of Brit cinema).",/review/rw6757696/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2015,Tweekums,9," A very different murder mystery
",When a body is discovered in the basement of a building that is being demolished the police are called in. Investigators DCI Cassie Stuart and DS Sunil 'Sunny' Khan are initially unsure if the case is worth investigating as they have no idea how old the body is and no obvious way of identifying it. The only clue is a rusting car key amazingly this leads to the car which leads to the identity of the victim and a book containing a list of names. The body belonged to a young black man who went missing in the seventies and the names belong to a variety of people; all of whose lives are about to be thrown into turmoil along with the lives of those around them.,/review/rw6757696/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2021,nezbitkn2,8," Slow burning drama. Excellent.
",Wow. What a few years I've enjoyed watching this series. I guess after the last episode we won't be seeing Unforgotten again. Very sad ending and had me choke up a little. Did feel a tad rushed but still had the desired effect on fans of the show. Shame it has to end. Will miss it. Meh.,/review/rw6757696/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2018,FIoret,9," Nicola Walker is a gift
",Excellent series but it wouldnt be the same without Nicola Walker. Her compassion and sympathy isnt just seen its felt. Each season gets better and better.,/review/rw6757696/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2017,Sleepin_Dragon,9," Unforgotten, literally.
","Unforgotten has really struck a chord with me, as a huge fan of Waking the Dead, the cold crime genre has had a void for several years. This show has more then filled the void, the stories are very well written and engaging. Production values are particularly strong, even more so in the second series. Nicola Walker and Sanjeev Bhaskar make for a great duo, her character has a great back story, Peter Egan is delightful as her father. More is needed from Sunny, his character is still a little undiscovered. Superb performances throughout, notably Tom Courtenay and Ruth sheen from the first series, and Mark Bonnar from the second. Six part runs somehow seem so short for this great show, but Nicola Walker seems in huge demand. Unforgotten manages to be engaging, mentally and emotional, I trigging enough to keep you guessing, and paced in such a way that you don't lose any interest. This is a great show. 9/10",/review/rw6757696/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2021,SunnyDaise,8," Different cop series
","Because of personal experiences, I usually avoid brutal/graphic shows and movies, but Unforgotten handles these issues better than most so I always watch. Exploring just one case per season works well. It's such a multi-faceted show, covering a much wider range of topics and isn't stereotypical, so comes across more realistically to me. If you want something similar but real-life, watch The Pembrokeshire Murders.",/review/rw6757696/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2015,pramodsmenon,10," Simple and Thrilling!!
","May be British shows are for a specific type of audience. I cant figure how they pick any genre and just transform it into a beautiful story with emotions and personalities. The focus for most shows is on how people think and do what they do. I have to say Unforgotten hits the right mark. Starting with the pilot, they showed a hint of each character - Simple and normal people you would meet everyday and end it by making them all people of interest in a 40 year old case. And how the show has developed since then with marvelous twists and turns, powerful performances and a real and beautiful London in the backdrop. I have reached only till the fourth episode as of now, and I have to say it is easily one of the best crime dramas I've ever seen.",/review/rw6757696/?ref_=tt_urv

7 April 2021,nancyldraper,10," Truly a UK Crime Drama at its best
","(Review at the end of Season/Series 3) Nicola Walker is a brilliant actor! So it is not surprising that this is an exceptional series. Don't expect a fast paced, shoot 'em up, action car chase police drama. If that is your favourite fare, you probably won't like this drama. But if you like a well crafted story that reels you in until you are sitting at the edge of your seat, with multi-faceted performances from an excellent cast, portraying believable characters living out the consequences of their own choices, you will love this series. At the end of Series 3, I elevated my rating from a 9 (superb) to a 10 (brilliant) out of 10 and it now is on my Top 40 TV Series list. The finale of this past season felt like a series finale, but the writer (Creator/Executive Producer - Chris Lang) of the show has since teased out that, should the audience wish, there may be a 4th. Already garnering critical success and BAFTA attention, I think the audience is not ready for DCI Cassie Stuart/Nicola Walker or DS Sunil' Khan/Sanjeev Bhaskar to retire. {Police Procedural}",/review/rw6757696/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2018,bshaef,9," Excellent in all Respects
",Watched the first episode on public tv channel today and have to say this is one of the most well plotted and told shows that I have seen in a long time. I look forward to watching the remaining Season 1 and Season 2 episodes. The actors are brilliant and the writers deserve a double A+ for the story.,/review/rw6757696/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2021,mickman91-1,8," Review after series 4: a down to earth, exceptionaly well written police show about more realistic investigation proceedings than most other cop shows. Its focus is on realism
","Review after series 4:
I struggle with a lot of cop shows because they are so full of stereotypes and predictable components and overdone storylines. What makes Unforgotten the wheat separate from the chaff then? It is in the writing. The show's USP is that it doesn't aim for dramatic action (eg Luther / Bodyguard), nor emotional poignancy (eg The Missing), nor the sex lives of the coppers (eg The Fall). Its focus is on the realistic process of crime solving and the thought processes that coppers go through in order to solve crimes and also to evidence them to the prosecution service. So the writing has to be watertight, and it manages to achieve this. Every element of the case logically moves forward based on clues and theories that the viewer has been privy to, and as a viewer you can follow it all believably and enjoy this process with the coppers at a realistic pace and with realistic stumbling blocks, wrong turns, luck, and outcomes. So this is really clever and really appreciated.",/review/rw6757696/?ref_=tt_urv

9 February 2017,golo348,10," The epitome of British crime dramas; not a wasted episode
","I've become hooked on British crime drama ever since a fortuitous viewing of ""Foyle's War"" (still one of my all-time favourites). Seeing the first episode of ""Unforgotten"" (Series 1) was enough to whet my appetite for more so I was thrilled to see what they would do with another season and another plot line that slowly and methodically (but not pedantically) plays out across all six episodes. What comes across in both series is that your past can pop up at the most inopportune moments. Play it for dramatic effect and you will understand why ""Unforgotten"" is such a powerful and mesmerizing crime drama series. Above all, it's the humanity of the characters that draws you in and keeps you interested in what will happen to them when the past rears its ugly head--sometimes with disastrous consequences!",/review/rw6757696/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2021,Manunited1981,10," World Class British drama, US take notes.
","So let me tell you something. I have been watching Crime dramas for well over 20 years now and this show is up there with the very very best, like top 3. I first saw Nicola Walker in a little ITV production in 1999 called "" last Train"" and there and then I said we would be watching this fine actress for years to come and has been in some of the most loved dramas of the last 20 years(last tango in Halifax, Scott and Bailey, spooks, the split, River, collateral) not to mention a brilliant turn to win an Olivier award in 2013 for The curious incident of the dog in the night-time.",/review/rw6757696/?ref_=tt_urv

25 August 2022,lhollan,7," Excellent writing and character development
","If you are attracted to shows that draw you to characters, this is excellent. The writers weave complex plots that one can pull together emotionally and that culminate in a meaningful way. I would have given this series a higher star score, but Nicola Walker becomes a burden to watch. She grows to be an unpleasant person whose life seems to be consistently under a dark cloud--and I think the actor brings far too much angst to the character. Aside from that strain, the series is well worth it, at least through series three.",/review/rw6757696/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2018,Majikat76,9," A must see!
","The latest series has been the best yet! Each and every Actor could have led the way, was gripping from start to finish. It's hard to pick the best role for Nicola Walker as she's pretty exceptional in everything, but this one takes it for me, I could not wait for each episode.",/review/rw6757696/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2021,EversonMovies,10," Seen on BBC & Netflix for years and ignored... How I wasted part of my life
","My title seems over dramatic, but actually it is spot on. I have always seen the poster artwork on ITV and Netflix , watched the trailer a few times but never gave it ago ( i partly put this down to British TV not being the best at creating trailers). But my god this is up there (season 1 anyway) as probably the best boxset I have seen. If you are fan of the likes britishy type of dramas of, Doctor Foster, The bodyguard, Thirteen, Luther , The nest, Liar, Happy valley..
Then this is up your alley.ot is unreal. Just watch it and you can thank me later 😁",/review/rw6757696/?ref_=tt_urv

6 August 2018,gmorgan51-158-682165,9," OMG
","Just watched the fourth episode of Season 3. Chris Lang has done it again. I love this series. It's not just the wonderful story line, or the intriguing plot, or the perfect dialogue, or how easily relatable the characters are - all of those things are there for me. It's the acting! The acting is so damned good! How does Nicola Walker and Sanjeev Bhaskar and the whole cast convey so much in a look, or a shrug, or in a thousand other ways? Did they learn by experience, is it the writing, or the sets, or the directing, or whatever else goes into producing a television series? I suspect it's all these things and much, much more. I'm certainly not a critic, and not much of a writer, but Unforgotten is superior television.",/review/rw6757696/?ref_=tt_urv
