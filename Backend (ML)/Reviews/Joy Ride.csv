",I found it absolutely riveting if a little difficult to follow at times. It's certainly a convoluted plot and best seen in 2/3 sittings unless you've got a really good memory.,/review/rw4039208/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2018,averyjamesdebruyn,," I wanted to like this show
","When I first saw the commercials for this show I was so excited! Such an interesting idea. The acting is fine. My issue is with the writing. The writing in this show is honestly terrible. They clearly have no idea how trauma affects human beings. You're telling me she spent 6 years in a glass tank and survived? In total isolation, trapped, consistently drowning on/off? I'm sorry but that is not possible. EVEN IF that was possible, the amount of trauma she would then have to overcome. She would not be good to go and fight crimes after talking to a professional twice. NOT ONLY THIS but the amount of animosity that people are holding towards her. The new wife acts as if helping her find a place to stay and having visits with her son is the greatest act of betrayal from the lead male character and instantly treats her like a homewrecker and him like a traitor. People don't do this? Why would she ever have so much hate for someone who has been traumatized for 6 bloody years. Tortured for 6 bloody years. It's like the writers don't understand what motivates human behaviours. The new wife's character has so much potential for a good story line. She could be conflicted with feelings of pity and jealousy. She could be understanding to her face but behind closed doors crushed in this situation. That's how real people would handle this impossible situation. There is no way you would be flat out hostile to someone who your husband thought was dead and turns out they were just being tortured this whole time. Instead they make her a vindictive bitch and it's intolerable to watch. The main woman ""emily"" seems to wade through this show only slightly traumatized and still able to fight crime, which is ridiculous AND everyone in this show is bloody victim blaming like she just disappeared for 6 years like it was shits and giggles. I just don't get it. I feel for the actors because they did their part, they acted well. And that's probably why it's rated so high. But the writing is just garbage. I think the writers need to look at the roots of what motivates human behaviour because literally no one acts the way they portray it.",/review/rw4039208/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2020,Sleepin_Dragon,6," Did they need to make it ten episodes long!!!!
","Emily is back, after five years presumed dead, she wants her life back, but things have changed, what she wants, is to find out who's held her hostage.",/review/rw4039208/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2017,Tactrix,3," Psychological Overture
",Let me start by saying this is going to give you some serious deja vu to psychological thrillers like the SAW series and mind twisters like Kidnapped.,/review/rw4039208/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2018,SnoopyStyle,6," nice dark mystery
","It's 6 years after Conrad Harlow's conviction for FBI agent Emily Byrne (Stana Katic)'s disappearance and presumed murder. Her FBI husband Nick Durand has remarried to Alice and Emily's son Flynn has long forgotten her. Nick receives a late night call from Harlow which leads to Emily's rescue from her watery tomb. Harlow is released from prison as trial evidences are proved incorrect. Emily's original target, crime boss Robert Semerov, is found waiting in the morgue and she is implicated. Boston police detective Tommy Gibbs investigates her case as she goes on the run. Her brother Jack and father Warren are her main supporters as even Nick starts to disbelieve her.",/review/rw4039208/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2018,htttrh,4," Just wasn't good... it tried though.
","Non Spoiler - This show tried and failed to be one of those ""amazing shows"" Very forced story telling and disjointed at times and it felt like 3 to 4 of the later episodes just dragged on and nothing was happening. It felt like the writers and producers at different parts of the series came up with ideas that didn't work and forced them into the story. Trying not to bash this show but it's pretty hollow, boring, with poor story telling. My recommendation is to watch something else because you are not missing anything if you don't see this.",/review/rw4039208/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2017,newjersian,3," Pure and simple drivel
","Almost every detective story is a fairy tale. But what differs a good detective story from a bad one? In a good detective story the events are somehow possible and believable. In a bad detective story what's going on on the screen is a continuous deception of the common sense. That's exactly what happens in all ten series of Absentia. We are asked to believe that the heroine doesn't need food, clothes, money, a place to sleep. She can run and fight the next day after an abdominal operation and losing a lot of blood. Her brother can operate on her without anesthesia, without the necessary surgical instruments, and the heroine miraculously avoids any infection. The way she's making on a bus for four hours, the police crosses just in ten minutes. But enough. The story is absolutely unbelievable, implausible and false. Not worth watching.",/review/rw4039208/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2018,mikebedding,7," A little confusing
","Not a bad watch, lots of twists perhaps too many but really deterred me at times was the sound production you seem to bounce from almost unhearable whispering to crash bang wallop action sound which meant spending several minutes adjusting the volume up and down..... think I'm getting old :-(",/review/rw4039208/?ref_=tt_urv

10 July 2019,injun-83620,4," Not well written
",The show has many holes in the story and scenes that make no sense and characters that must be able to walk through walls. You will see,/review/rw4039208/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2018,JamieClay,4," This series will give you binge regret.
",This was one of those creepy weird crime dramas that fell apart in the last few episodes. The kind of binge you likely will feel regret for completing. It starts off good but by episode 6 cracks in the story and writing become more frequent until the final episode where it just disappoints.,/review/rw4039208/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2019,dussaultjulien,1," Got off to a good start, but blew it. Horrible. Don't waste your time
","I stopped watching almost 8 episode's in because this show sucked so bad. The pacing is all over the place, the story way too convoluted and downright stupid at most parts, and by episode 8 you'll bw turing it off just like me.",/review/rw4039208/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2018,thimsmot-99791,4," Distracting Amateur Sound
","The dialog, ADR, and sound mix are so bad that they take you out of the story, shot to shot. On top of that, there's far too whispering and mumbling by the male lead. Half of his dialog is completely lost. Very annoying.",/review/rw4039208/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2017,Zaffy-1,7," Overall satisfying - Katic's best performance so far
","I agree with another reviewer that Absentia had a very interesting premise, but I think that somewhere along the way it got a bit confused. However it was intriguing, quite well made show, it had suspense and Katic gives her best performance ever, she is actually carrying the damn thing on her shoulders*. ",/review/rw4039208/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2019,jquartemont-242-751784,4," Lukewarm direction

30 September 2017,mig991-1,," It just gets crazier.
","**Spoilers may be contained in this post** OK, I have made it through episode 5. It just gets worse and worse. The story is so insane. How did this woman go from being kidnapped for six years to the suspect in so many murders in like 30 minutes.",/review/rw4039208/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2018,skay_baltimore,2," So unbelievably stupid!
","This is about the stupidest thing I've ever seen, short of Vin Diesel flicks where cars magically fly off of bridges into moving trains. Good LORD this thing is insulting to any thinking person's intelligence. Believe me, career criminals EVERYWHERE are hoping that all FBI agents are as absolutely hopelessly idiotic as Nick Durand. This show utterly defies logic, the laws of physics, the laws of human physiology (and I think several laws in some southern U.S. states as well). I'm not even sure Superman himself could pull off some of the stuff that is displayed here in this series. Can you say LOW BUDGET, BAD ACTING, INSANE PLOT HOLES?!!! (Well, if you can, you can definitely say Absentia!) ",/review/rw4039208/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2018,PaulDVernon,4," MARMITE - love it or hate it.
","Okay - I have watched up to and including Episode 4 but enough is enough. Most other reviewers have covered the good and not so good points- and I am curious to know how it ends. However I can't sit through another 6 episodes of mumbling and quiet speaking or whispering. Audio is 50% of a film and it isn't working if you are straining constantly to hear what the actors are saying.
Ok - yes, I could put on the subtitles, but should I have to? No, not for an English speaking TV series. With even better and more sophisticated sound recording equipment why is it so difficult for sound engineers to get the balance correct!
So the plan is to read the plot lines of Episodes 5 to 9 and then try and watch Episode 10. Wish me luck!",/review/rw4039208/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2019,chron,4," Shark - Meet Arthur Fonzarelli
","I watched the first episode, but couldn't get past the absurdity of the plot points. They were full of the worst tropes. We have super-villans. We have psychologically super-human FBI agents. The writing is lazy garbage. It has all of the realism of a Mavel Comics movie.",/review/rw4039208/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2018,douglas-higgins,5," Drawn out
",This could have been a good series if they collapsed into 5-6 episodes. It is so drawn out that I found myself fast forwarding through superlative dialogue and scenes. Acting is passable at best with very mediocre performances. The lead investigator with the BPD and Nick from the FBI are annoying with wooden performances.,/review/rw4039208/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2018,merylmatt,5," Holes & Filler Chase Scenes

3 November 2019,Cilica,1," One should be on Herione or Meth to Watch.
","Six years kidnapped, found and in less than a week she's wanting to go driving, lead a normal life, and for her husband to choose her over his new wife...oh and yes go after the person she thinks kidnapped her. Wow great story based in some ultra universe where time has no baring on reality.",/review/rw4039208/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2018,apisano-13319,1," So bad...

21 January 2018,lunga,1," Turned it off very shortly into the first episode
","Just too far-fetched. When they arrived at the hospital after recusing her and the press was already there, I stopped watching. When a TV show work itself get out of its own contrivance in the first 15 minutes, there is no hope for it. Lazy writing.",/review/rw4039208/?ref_=tt_urv
