10 January 2021,Shhhtick,1," Over produced
","The original was a very good show, if this wasn't on Fox, it would probably be better. It is extremely over produced and the audience is as bad as an infomercial audience.",/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2021,dumluk2002,1," Ruined by the Host. No one else available?
",Couldn't get past Jane Krakowski. Why all the mugging for the camera? Sorry. Can't do it.,/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2021,rmmil,2," Really awkward
","The hosts are really awkward, watching Jane dance in episode 2 made me bury my face, and Randy's ""dog""-like response to seemingly every question should have ended on American Idol.",/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2021,jnaddor,2," Interesting concept with a horrendous execution
","The concept of a game show centered around naming a song can be great. The execution in this show was awful. The audience is very fake with how excited they get, and the attempts at building suspense are laughable. The hostess is also laughably bad.",/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2021,noladel,1," Who Is Responsible for this Mess?
","This was so bad, I could not even watch the whole show. The host is a hot mess.",/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2021,talis-briedis-79-541083,," Jane is awful at everything
","Bad actress, bad host, really bad at comedy. She just ruins everything. What were the producers thinking putting her in as a host? Oh, this show was meant to fail...",/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2021,viridel,1," Utter and absolute shlock.
","Honestly, I just don't get it. Jeopardy and Price is Right are two of the most popular and long running game shows of all time. What do they have in common? Simple approach, fast paced, NO MANUFACTURED DRAMA!",/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2021,freakineye,1," What did I just watch?
",This show was pretty bad. So so awkward to watch. The audience was so bad and over produced when trying to create suspense out of nothing. The clues were so easy they didn't need more than 1 note to guess a song? The hosts wardrobe was a bit much for a family game show. I don't plan on giving this another shot. It was just awful.,/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2021,b-05072,1," Meh
","Good concept, terrible choice of hosts.. Randy Jackson? Cringe.. Blonde woman I don't know, CRINGE.",/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2021,crushercat,2," Very Awkward
","Love the show concept, speed, skill requirement, and tension...but, Jane is SO inexperienced being #1 on stage and the show's amateur camera focus on Jane's dancing & singing are cringeworthy. Randy appears to be a head puppet on a stiff cool 88-key expert...he's way too stiff and rehearsed.",/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2021,dvtime-94372,1," Missed the mark.
","I loved the show as a kid and I am completely disappointed with this new show. The host is terrible, she looks very underdressed and cheap. Very over produced. Will not be watching again.",/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2021,atlasmb,6," I Can Name That Tune In Three Notes!
","This incarnation of the popular musical quiz show features the multi-talented Jane Krakowski as host and Randy ""Dawg"" Jackson on piano. Two contestants compete for money by displaying their talents at identifying songs by clues and musical snippets.",/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2021,jalenaaliyah,1," Jane dresses tacky
",Jane dresses like she is at a strip club and not a game show...when women get older (50+) they seem to think one size fits all ages..it doesn't..you do not have to dress with less to get attention...hang up those minis and thigh high boots...they make you look desperate for attention and the attention should be on the players..OMG who wants to see you kick your leg up with a mini dress on....please stop,/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2021,MiketheWhistle,3," OK, we got it, you're boob obsessed
","During the first half of the pilot I was a tad annoyed by the ample cleavage showing bra, but said ok. Then during the 2nd half different dress but still ample cleavage and then there was the Dolly Parton joke. I know many are obsessed with boobs, but I'm not one. Ms. Krakowski is a beautiful woman, but we don't need her flaunting her boobs. Vanna White is also a beautiful woman, and when I watched that show she wore beautiful clothes but none that basically put her wears out there for you. Perhaps if the show were a different genre I'd have a different opinion, but it does nothing for the show.",/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2021,lovesamystery32-1,2," Stick to the Classic Show
","I like Jane Krakowski usually. I admit that Randy Jackson and his ""dawg"" have always bugged me. I loved Name That Tune as a child and we occasionally watch old episodes on YouTube. I know the format and have always enjoyed the game. A modern take with modern music? I'm in!",/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2021,mgreider-73160,2," Really cringe
",It's not good at all. When watching the first episode all I was reminded of was the scene in the Hunger Games when all the contestants went on that talk show. Everything seems so disingenuous.,/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2021,toomanyfroggers,1," Fake
",Its pretty obvious that some of the contestants are actors. ..and the whole this is cringy.,/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2021,jcpatriots2010,3," Awkward
",I feel like this show could be decent if there was a better host. Jane is just extremely awkward and this isn't the right type of job for her. Get rid of Jane and get a better host.,/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2021,jbfxtmfwh,6," Not enough music
","I can hardly get through an episode. Too drawn out and too much ""fluff"" between Jane & Randy....drives me nuts. I was so excited for this show and so incredibly let down. Could have been so much better...what a waste.",/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2021,adingwell,1," Really bad in just about every way
","If you're a fan of Jamie Fox and Shazam then you're going to hate Name That Tune. If robots become game show hosts, they can be fashioned after Jane Krakowski. Jamie is funny and entertaining. And he knows music. Jane is wooden and insincere. The show premise is terrible and way too easy. The only saving grace is Randy and his band. They're pretty good. After one episode, I won't be watching any more and after season 1, I don't expect anyone else will be watching either.",/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2021,LukeCoolHand,6," Not very good
","Here is what is wrong with she show::
1. Randy Jackson acts awkward and stiff - comments are stupid
2. Randy plays the piano too soft - notes are not distinct
3. Fake laughing oohing and aweing by audience is stupid.
4. 10 notes to start? Too many
5. Needs more classic songs - rock and pop.",/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2021,NotAFilmCritic101001,3," This show is cringey dawg!
","Look, it is what it is... The show is over-produced, the thing that studios keep doing where they have two hosts is here and it's needless, the female host is cringe on bath salts.",/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2022,janderson-97364,4," Jane makes me want to punch a hole through my tv
","I love the show, but ya know how horror movies try to make you feel uncomfortable the whole time? This is what Jane does to the show, she needs a talkin to. And I just wish randy was the only host.",/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2021,chrondog18,10," I love this show. ðŸ˜€
",This show is so good. The band can sound like any band or musician. Can even do rap. Sounding exactly like the original song every time. I can't belive it when they can guess it with just one note. So impressive. Love the host's and definitely under-rated.,/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2021,benaustin-01535,6," Not too bad for a rebooted game show
","The game itself isn't too bad, similar to the original. The crowd 'oooos' all the time gets annoying quick during the bidding and trying to 'capture' reactions of the crowd seems scripted like they do on the 'Masked' shows. It's a sub par reboot... but what do you expect from prime time TV these days?",/review/rw6578555/?ref_=tt_urv
