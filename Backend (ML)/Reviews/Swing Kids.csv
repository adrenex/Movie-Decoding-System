21 September 2013,SnoopyStyle,8," Brendan Gleeson is brilliant
","A shipload of cocaine worth $500Million 'Street Value' is coming into Ireland, and the only people who can stop it is Gerry Boyle (Brendan Gleeson) and FBI agent Wendell Everett (Don Cheadle).",/review/rw2486890/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2011,ferguson-6,7," Either Smart or Stupid
","Greetings again from the darkness. Writer/Director John Michael McDonagh is the brother of Martin McDonagh, who brought us the excellent In Bruges (which also starred Brendan Gleeson). I figured it best to say that upfront because there is no way to avoid comparisons of the two films. Clearly these men grew up in the same house and were trained in a brilliant method of writing dialogue.",/review/rw2486890/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2012,gradyharp,8," 'I'm Irish. Racism is part of my culture.'
","Something there is that is charming about films set in Ireland with Irish characters speaking in beautiful brogue and THE GUARD fits into that category very comfortably. Written and directed by John Michael McDonagh this is a funny, fast-paced film that manages to poke fun at many points of bigotry (anti-American, racism, the gay lifestyle, etc) in a manner that keeps the comedy rolling. In many ways the film is comparable to the film IN BRUGES, if that helps the reader to categorize in a positive way.",/review/rw2486890/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2011,Davor_Blazevic_1959,9," Character-driven, raucously thrilling crime comedy
","Screenplay writer John Michael McDonagh's directorial debut, ""The Guard"" (2011) is really a fine movie, relying the least on the originality of its story, describing criminal proceedings of the group of cocaine drug-smugglers and their interaction with local police, set against the backdrop of small-town western Ireland, however, filled with crackling good dialogue, sparkling with wisecracks, accompanied with nice scenery and pleasant, unobtrusive music. But, what makes it the best is its protagonists' performances.",/review/rw2486890/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,markgorman,7," Gleeson commands the screen from start to finish. Hilarious.
","Michael McDonagh is the brother of one of the funniest writers in the world just now. Like him, he is a foul mouthed upstart with a unique ability to investigate Irishness with tremendous energy and vividness.",/review/rw2486890/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2011,kosmasp,10," Protecting comedy
","I really don't like those phrases but this movie deserves the ""instant classic"" tag in my book. B. Gleeson is just amazing and seeing Don Cheadle having a role where he is actually acting is a treat in itself too. He has shown so much potential (Hotel Rwanda to name but one movie), but has done quite a few awful movies too, that I always relish him in the ones that actually are good.

30 December 2013,Tweekums,9," A very funny Irish crime comedy
","Garda Sergeant Gerry Boyle works in Connemara in the remote West of Ireland; he is an unconventional cop he takes drugs, enjoys the company of prostitutes and doesn't work on his day off even if somebody might be moving half a billion dollars' worth of cocaine through his patch. When somebody is found murdered the scene suggests an occult motive but when Boyle attends a briefing given by FBI Special Agent Wendell Everett he recognises the man as one of four who are meant to be smuggling a large quantity of cocaine into the country.",/review/rw2486890/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2011,bob the moo,," Wonderfully dark humour with great characters and dialogue throughout – Gleeson owns it
","Sergeant Gerry Boyle is a rather unconventional police officer – and perhaps not as effective as he could be. When the FBI trace major cocaine players to his district, Boyle is surprised to find that none of them are black or Mexican, but ends up assisting FBI agent Wendell Everett who, for his money, cannot work out if Boyle is really smart or really dumb.",/review/rw2486890/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2018,nogodnomasters,10," YOU LOST ME AT ""WE"".
","Brendan Gleeson stars as a small town Sgt. in Ireland. In many ways he reminded me of Andy of Mayberry in that he has his own local quirky ways of doing things, but beneath it all he is quite intelligent. There are some international drug smugglers in his area and the FBI has sent Don Cheadle to work with the very frank, sometimes crass Gleeson who believes racial stereotypes and has no problems questioning Cheadle to the point of his frustration.",/review/rw2486890/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2012,planktonrules,7," Strange and uneven--but worth seeing.
","""The Guard"" is a VERY unconventional story--mostly because the character Brendan Gleeson plays is so very confusing--in some ways a horrible policeman and in other ways quite extraordinary. On one hand, he sleeps with prostitutes, breaks rules, seems to not care the least about his job and steals some weapons when a kid discovers a hidden cache--the rest he sells to the IRA!! Yet, when it comes to investigating a case involving some cut-throat drug smugglers, he's oddly one of the only men on the force who refuses to be on the take.",/review/rw2486890/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2011,bdgill12,," Understated and funny, a showpiece for Gleeson
","Despite the fact that I live in a bustling metropolis, all of the theaters that show smaller films are somewhere between 30 and 50 miles away. In ""Dallas Traffic Time"", that translates to somewhere between 90 minutes and 16 days. As a result, I don't get time to see many of these films until they come to DVD, if at all. In my experience, art house films are often the most difficult to write about and even more difficult to properly judge, particularly in the summer. When almost everything I've watched in the last three months has involved superheroes, aliens, or jokes related to bodily functions, I have a tough time transitioning to more mature and cinematic endeavors. So it is with ""The Guard, a film entirely unlike anything else I saw this summer.",/review/rw2486890/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2014,LeonLouisRicci,8," Irish Cop Pointing to a Derringer ""I guess it could be used to kill little Protestants.""
","This Film was Made in Ireland by Irishmen. The Accents are as Thick as the Profanity in this Satirical Ethnic Crime Film. There is a lot of Humor Derived from Stereotypical Racism, so if that Offends, Stay Away from this. Ditto if Four Letter Words Turn You off.",/review/rw2486890/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2012,JohnRayPeterson,8," A precious little gem of a movie (not your usual comedy)
","First you need to read the full storyline of this movie, then consider the two main characters, Sergeant Gerry Boyle and FBI agent Wendell Everett, played by Brendan Gleeson and Don Cheadle respectively, and you have yourself the makings of something special. Many of you know about Cheadle but perhaps the name of Gleeson not as much; he has a wealth of experience and you will not be disappointed by any of this actor's performances. Since I watch a fair share of Euro productions, I knew I was in for a treat. Sergeant Boyle is a character you can't help but loathe and really like all at the same time, in other words an ideal character for the screen, and he's got the physical appearance that commands attention. Cheadle plays such a different character that the pair's interaction has you hooked for the duration. It is not a gut laughing movie, but one that uses humour naturally flowing from Irish culture. Oh yeah your ears are likely not tuned for some of the dialogue which is heavy with the Irish dialect, so the pause-rewind features will come in handy (by all means, use them it's worth it not to miss the colorful dialogue).",/review/rw2486890/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2012,Mr-Fusion,7," Funny, touching, character piece
","This is a movie that would've gone unnoticed, were it not for one of the many ""Top 10 Under-appreciated Movies"" posts you see on so many blogs. And I'm glad I read that, because ""The Guard"" turned out to be hidden gem.",/review/rw2486890/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2011,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,10," The Guard (2011)
","From the brother of the director of In Bruges. In many ways the film follows a close pattern of dark comedy, fantastic characters that you love, and huge belly laughs. An FBI agent arrives in a small Irish town and must deal with Brendan Gleeson's rude and crude local cop. Gleeson's Boyle is a wonderful creation. He has heart but is such an arsehole you're surprised people can remain in his presence. He appears not to care about taking drugs and doing hookers, but when it comes down to serious matters, he's at the top of his game. What's wonderful to see is Gleeson putting up a front to appear stupid and ignorant, but then uses that to surprise both his colleagues and his enemies. Along the way we are also introduced to a trip of philosophy quoting drug traffickers that also have a sense of humour about their job. This is almost like a Lethal Weapon movie with real people, where they don't know they are in a buddy/action comedy. Bad guys aren't acting bad and good guys aren't acting good. The humour breaks the mood in many scenes, but in the best possible way. The setting only adds to the brilliance of it all. It's like a small Wicker-Man community where big drug dealing is going down. Like In Bruges, it gave me characters I cared for, action I was enthralled by, and restrained camera work that allowed me to appreciate everything that was going on.",/review/rw2486890/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2011,Philby-3,," Tale of an authentic Irish Hero
","""Welcome to Connemara"" says a roadside sign glimpsed from time to time in this entertaining movie, but this part of the west of Ireland is portrayed as being distinctly dangerous. Even prior to the opening titles there is a fatal road crash, and Guard (Irish policeman) Gerry Boyle (Brendan Gleeson) soon has a murder on his hands, a missing colleague and then a major drug- smuggling plot. In fairness to the locals the major criminals are imported, from England as well as from Dublin (almost as bad, in the opinion of the locals). Brendan is put on the case with an unlikely partner, a black American FBI agent Wendell Everett (Don Cheadle), initial animosity gradually turning to mutual respect, but they are up against bent cops as well as the ruthless psychopaths (sorry, sociopaths) of the drug gang. Just to make things more difficult for B, his mother is dying. The denouement is satisfying but there is plenty of humour along the way to offset the tension.",/review/rw2486890/?ref_=tt_urv

16 October 2017,dongwangfu,10," One of the best movies of the last decade
","I've seen this film three times, and it simply is incredibly complete. Brendan Gleeson and Don Cheadle are great in both the comedic and dramatic scenes, and especially good playing off each other. It works as a buddy cop movie and as a wry commentary on the genre, all the way until the photographer's wry meta-commentary signals the merging of the two at the end. Consistently unexpected and original, it captures the Irish penchant for deadpan humor very effectively -- and while there are some significant differences in approach, I left the theater with a respect for the director's craft that I only reliably experience with the Coen brothers.",/review/rw2486890/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2012,StevePulaski,8," Serious, funny, and seriously funny
","The Guard is funny because of how diverse the two protagonists are and the fact that we aren't sure if one of them really knows they're being a nuisance. We have Brendan Gleeson, playing an Irish policeman (Garda) named Gerry Boyle, who is a foul-mouthed, unapologetic heavy-set man, and Don Cheadle playing Wendell Everett, a strange-laced FBI agent who never lets himself go outside of the guidelines. Unlike Boyle who allows himself to have fun with the job.",/review/rw2486890/?ref_=tt_urv

","I like going to see movies. I mean it: I like going to see movies. So the bare fact that the last film I felt compelled to go out to see was Takeshi Miike's Samurai pastiche 13 ASSASSINS, well over a month ago, will give us all some idea of the paucity of quality films that have been available this summer. Largely, it's been a summer of super hero spectaculars, lame remakes of lame originals, ""bromances"", and animated dreck; nothing to which I could give a definitive answer to the question, ""Would I get more enjoyment out of seeing this movie, or sticking my tongue in a desk fan?""",/review/rw2486890/?ref_=tt_urv
