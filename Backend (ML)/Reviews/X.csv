29 March 2020,Hitchcoc,8," Lots of Nice Little Twists
","No, it wasn't perfect. No it was not Academy Award material. But it was a delightful story with lots of classic whodunnit elements. I thought we got to know each character well and, like in an Agatha Christie novel, fulfilled their roles. I thought Craig did a nice job and kept things moving along. Plummer was good in his limited screen time. Once again, I'm so fed up with people who decide that IMDB presents an opportunity to destroy a valid system by giving a movie such as this a rating of One. Do you really think this film ranks down there with Alligator Women on Venus. That's what the One ratings are for. It's usually because a film gets a little hype and those with no imagination or who are unhappy with their lives feel the need to throw everything off. Use lower ratings, but try to show some objectivity.",/review/rw5286956/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Knives out
","Knives Out is really a classic story of it's kind set in modern day with Daniel Craig even playing a very clear Hercule Poirot type character. There's a bit more humor and self-awareness than a lot of those classic stories, but never to the degree that it takes away from the twists and the mysteries. And there are some good twists. In fact one of the biggest mysteries is revealed midway through the movie which actually led me to check the time thinking ""damn, are we near the end already?"" but nope, they were just taking the movie on a left turn to Albuquerque that I did not anticipate and changed the course of the whole thing. Johnson has constructed a great mystery in the spirit of the classics. The fun of it too is how many twists there are without it ever feeling overdone. In that way also you can predict a few twists, but not another, so have fun feeling smart and still feel surprised by the others. It's just a classic fun film of its type.",/review/rw5286956/?ref_=tt_urv

18 December 2019,Coventry,8," Pimp My Agatha Christie!
","With the exception of my wife and daughter, and possibly my mother, Agatha Christie is the woman whom I love most on this planet. She truly was the most gifted and brilliant fiction writer who ever lived, and it rejoices me to see that her work still inspires other writers and filmmakers nowadays; more than forty years after she passed away. There are still many adaptations of her original work, but with ""Knives Out"", writer/director Rian Johnson attempts something entirely different. It's abundantly clear that Johnson was inspired by all of Christie's typical trademarks and hobby-horses, and he pays tribute to her most legendary characters and favorite settings, but the plot of ""Knives Out"" is entirely new and scripted directly for the screen. A good old-fashioned murder mystery/whodunit set in the enormous mansion of a wealthy family, full of eccentric people each of whom have dirty little secrets, convoluted plot twists, continuous red herrings that practically make it impossible to guess along, and a fabulous all-knowing but slightly odd sleuth slowly unravelling the clues.",/review/rw5286956/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2021,TheLittleSongbird,8," Well worth tucking into
","It was very hard to say no to watching 'Knives Out' and it was one of my most anticipated films since it came out. It was due to being busy and personal problems that stopped me from seeing it sooner. A lot drew me in to watching it. Absolutely love murder mysteries and seeing a lot of comparisons to one of my favourite authors Agatha Christie and the starry cast were reasons enough for me to see it, as well as the great reviews.",/review/rw5286956/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2019,planktonrules,9," How can this film currently have a 6.8 rating when it's one of the best pictures of the year?!
","Sometimes I am shocked when I see a great film...only to see it has an incredibly low overall score on IMDB. This is definitely the case with ""Knives Out""....a great film by writer/director Rian Johnson that I strongly recommend you see. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this one receives some Oscar nominations...it's that good.",/review/rw5286956/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2019,kamalhasnaa,9," Bravo!
","Nothing was typical about this. Everything was beautifully done in this movie, the story, the flow, the scenario, everything.
I highly recommend it for mystery lovers, for anyone who wants to watch a good movie!",/review/rw5286956/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2022,robertasmith,6," Rather Dull
","Enjoyable in patches, it just doesn't engage. Hollywood has a long history of silly accents, and the accent adopted by Daniel Craig is just plain daft and simply not needed. Why oh why do actors agree to do such things. The biggest irony for me is there is a clip of an episode of 'murder she wrote' and every episode of that Angela Lansbury series was better written and acted than this film. The director can't make his mind up whether this is comedy, pastiche or a real murder mystery. Some of the acting is appalling and none of it that good. The script is badly written and the continuity dodgy in places. There have been other films that have tried such plots with dysfunctional families and none seem to work but such stories seem to on the small screen.",/review/rw5286956/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2020,pritol,8," Refreshing revisit of the classic ""Whodunnit""
","Great movie that really does have all the hallmarks of the classic murder mystery. The story is fairly typical, there is a shocking death, everyone has their motives, and piece by piece the truth is pulled together by a sleuth, in this case Benoit Blanc (great name), who comes across as a more modern version of Hercule Poirot.",/review/rw5286956/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2022,paul2001sw-1,5," Not so cleverly constructed
","'Knives Out' is a (barely) contemporary twist on the Agatha Christie template: a country house, a rich dead man, all the family are suspects, and a famous detective is fortunately on hand to sort things out. It's always hokum, but it can be fun when done well. But I didn't find this film a success. The detective had no good reason to be present, for a start (and I didn't find Daniel Craig convincing as an American southerner either). More than that, we learn that the first explanation (the one that only exists to be proven wrong) is false at the moment it is offered to us, meaning that the grand reveal of the full truth upturns nothing of consequence. And the central plot device - a woman who can't lie without vomiting - is not only bizarre, it also means the hero and the audience alike get a pretty preposterous head start on what's really going on. It's entertaining enough; but insufficiently clever as to transcend its inherent ridiculousness.",/review/rw5286956/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2019,UniqueParticle,10," The perfect whodunnit film
",Beautifully filmed and thought out very well which to me is good enough! Great ensemble cast that did excellent acting among adding hilarious parts in many scenes. Absolutely love Daniel Craig and Ana De Amas did awesome! I'm sure Knives Out has mixed opinions but I am very glad I got to see an early screening.,/review/rw5286956/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2022,DuskShadow,5," What a ridiculous flick
","The last few years have had some stinker wannabe ""mystery"" films, especially the recent rehashes of the Hercule Poirot detective tales Murder On the Orient Express and Death On the Nile. The forer was ok, but the latter sucked so hard it was pathetic.",/review/rw5286956/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2020,markovd111,6," Not what I expected and what I saw didn't make me appreciate it any more...
","Having quality actors and good critical reception, I thought this movie will be fun, so I watched it with my mom, as we love those ""Clue/Cluedo"" style comedy movies. I expected a comedy about weird characters in a mansion trying to solve a murder. Sadly, movie takes a different turn, innovates and changes the old formula of movie like this. This is sad not because of the sole fact that the formula is changed, but because the movie felt really long and boring. It's ending is fun, but... Yeah... This is actually just a classic crime movie, with a few humorous moments. And nothing else. Having in mind the great cast, I expected so much more from this movie and can't help but to fell really disappointed. It could have been so much more! Eh... It's not a bad movie.... It's an OK movie... But not a great one for sure. 6.5/10! It can still be fun and give you a few laughs, but don't expect too much, because you simply won't find it here...",/review/rw5286956/?ref_=tt_urv

30 November 2019,grayner-2,6," Kind of overrated to me
","I have read the many glowing reviews for this film and I honestly don't get it. Yes, there were some very funny and entertaining parts. It was a very good ensemble cast. Daneil Craig does his best Kevin Spacey as Frank Underwood impression. But beyond that, I found the cast woefully underused. Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson etc. I expected Jamie Lee to play a major role but she seemed more like window dressing. She also, as the daughter, appeared to have no real motive for the murder. So the real crime here was her underuse. 1/2 of the members of the family had no motive mentioned. Then, when the ""murder"" was revealed at the half way point, it was clear Martha did not really do it and was being set up. Chris Evans conveniently shows up at the halfway point with lines, so the reveal, for the most part is painfuly obvious, or at least most of it. The give-aways were pretty obvious, like granny saying ""Random, you're back AGAIN"" or the comment on how the dogs barked only with certain people. The mention of the ""slayer"" law was very, very obvious. I understand this is a parody of the sleuth genre but shouldn't there be at least some surprises?",/review/rw5286956/?ref_=tt_urv

1 December 2019,tcasavecchia,8," Hated Last Jedi. Loved this.
","As a fan of mysteries (Sherlock Holmes, Poirot, Columbo, Monk, Psych.etc.) I was thrilled to see someone making a classic style whodunnit...and the cast! Figure you can't go wrong. Well I enjoyed it & while the cast all have time to shine it is Daniel Craig with his Southern drawl & especially Ana de Armas that steal the show. For anyone keeping away because they hated The Last Jedi...I agree, it was my least favourite of all the Star Wars films, but this is a well written film that was well acted and I can only hope this will inspire others to reinvigorate the murder mystery genre.",/review/rw5286956/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2020,RetroRick,6," Lower your expectations & you'll enjoy, raise them too much & you'll be disappointed
","Have to say I was a little disappointed by this, not because it isn't good. Arguably it is, but no doubt because so many rave reviews suggested this would be outstandingly good, which it isn't. So as with so many films your experience & enjoyment will depend on the expectations you bring with you.",/review/rw5286956/?ref_=tt_urv

",A 45 minute mystery stretched out for two hours! You can figure out who's innocent within the first 30 minutes! This story is so 'actuel' the political/social overtones are unpalatable to the plot.

","I saw the film a few months back and now that I noticed it is available for home watch decided to check the eating again, as at the time it was way too high in my opinion. I thought it would have gone down. It has not. Did I miss something spectacular about this film? Do I not have a sense of humor? I don't get it. It was ok. A bit slow. And absolutely nothing special. I think the ending was revealed too early and the twist was not suprising nor did I care about it. Weird.",/review/rw5286956/?ref_=tt_urv

28 January 2020,bigmin,4," Massively underwhelming
","Being a middle aged Englishman I've been brought up on a diet of murder mystery stories and in many respects I've been spoilt. When the stories have translated from book to screen the production value is almost always secondary to the good conjunct story. I was very excited, having read the reviews, that seemingly in the case of 'Knives Out' I would be getting a rare trinity of a good story, good actors and good production. It certainly has two of the three. Unfortunately this film thinks it's cleverer than it is. It's simply a story of a privileged family and their pettiness with a rather trivial murder mystery chucked in as a contrivance to get them all together. Rian Johnson attempts to display the worst nature of the privileged minority with all the subtlety of a man screaming 'I am woke' at the top of his lungs at anybody who'll listen. Unfortunately subtlety and nuance are what makes for a good mystery story, you need to pay attention so as not to miss anything. With this film you could miss probably the middle third of the film and you'd not be any less aware of what's happening. A bit of a shame really.",/review/rw5286956/?ref_=tt_urv

28 November 2019,masonsaul,10," Incredibly complex whodunit
","Knives Out is an incredibly complex whodunit that skillfully subverts expectations, switches between multiple genres easily and effectively and only gets better with multiple viewings. It's also surprisingly extremely funny and expertly paced. All of it's incredible cast are excellent but Chris Evans, Daniel Craig and Ana De Armas give the standout performances. Rian Johnson's direction is incredible and the film is extremely well filmed. The music by Nathan Johnson is fantastic.",/review/rw5286956/?ref_=tt_urv
