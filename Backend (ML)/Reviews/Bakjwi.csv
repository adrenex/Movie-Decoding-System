29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Already Miss It!
",Hawaii Five-0 is a pretty entertaining police that's based off the original show. It's a fun and fast paced police procedural that gives you everything you want in a cop show that can just waste some time for you. They show Hawaii to be as beautiful as ever. I never watched the original Hawaii Five-0 because it was on before I was born therefore I can't compare the two but this newer one is really good in its own right and is absolutely worth watching! The entire cast does an incredible job. The only bad part of this show is the ending. They had to rush it because of COVID so they couldn't give it the ending they intended. If you're looking for a really fun police procedural that will keep you engaged throughout the series than this is the show for you.,/review/rw4439151/?ref_=tt_urv

1 March 2011,janus-20,9," Hawaii Five- O WOW !
","I LOVE this show, LOVE it, its just the shot in the arm TV needs, its the complete antithesis of most of the other American shows we get here in the UK and its such a welcome contrast.",/review/rw4439151/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2022,eliaselnaz,8," Exciting thriller,action, but...
","Everything about this series was impressive and in most of the episodes there is a humanitarian message to be learned , but some characters are suddenly missing and it's frustrating. For example Dr. Sharp in One episode is blocked in the elavator with Danny Williams, but then Suddenly we don't see her any more, and the same happens to Leylani the first Chin Ho's girl friend after her late wife or Charli Fong,crime scene specialist who seemed very close to Five-O and even to Steve himself, but all of them disappear without giving a good reason to viewer. Apart from this lack of deep characterization every other thing about this series, story, acts, music, light, decors, special effects ,rhythm, every aspect was stunning.",/review/rw4439151/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2019,pshbhatt,1," Used to love this show
",I used to love this show and I tried to be loyal even after Danirk Dae Kim and Grace Park left the show but I could not. The original team was perfect but the show went downhill and I stopped watching it. I guess making money by cutting of characters is more important than the audience's satisfaction.,/review/rw4439151/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2010,Deana_1977,10," Best show I've seen in years!
","I was a huge fan of the original Hawaii Five-O, so when I heard about this attempt at a new show, I was excited but skeptical at the same time. Would it be just another CSI, or would it be different? Would it deserve to be called 'Hawaii Five-O'? Well, I must say...",/review/rw4439151/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2010,cdn_moviefan,," I enjoyed the pilot episode, it's got some heart to it
","Actors: Main 3 are cookie cutter, nearly identical birth years. I like that they're in their 30's and not all 90210 on viewers. Storyline: Definitely an action show, and it's done adequately. Script: Solid. Some cheesy stuff, some wow stuff, some well acted scenes. A few roll your eyes moments, but that keeps in part with the way the original was. ",/review/rw4439151/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2022,nils-65654,10," Best series ever
","By far the best series I've seen so far. 10 seasons with more than 200 episodes. Every single episode is about a new crime. A series cannot be more varied. I grew so fond of the characters. The way Steve and Dany treat each other is awesome. So entertaining, exciting and funny.",/review/rw4439151/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2010,schappe1,4," Hawaii Five-A
","Firstly, I'll identify myself, as every reviewer should: I'm a 56 year-old who was a fan of the old show. So I'm n going to inevitably view the new show from that perspective. If I were a 20 year old who didn't know there was an old show, I'm sure my perspective would be quite different.",/review/rw4439151/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2010,pensman,3," Not the O
","There can be only one Steve McGarrett and Alex O'Loughlin isn't him. I had hoped to like this series but there is nothing new or old here. Alex O'Loughlin leads a cast without chemistry. While it's nice to see Hawaii again as background, it's not enough. Scott Caan comes across as more of a poor imitation of Don Johnson's Crockett than a fleshed out Danny Williams. Instead of living on a boat with a crock, he has a kid. Big change for the worse. And plot is just shoot em up Burn Notice/N.C.I.S. Los Angeles. There is a lot of yelling, a few sob's tossed about (no doubt to prove it's an adult show), and big guns. Yawn.",/review/rw4439151/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2022,robert-14651,8," Well produced
",Admittedly a bit campy but the show is worth watching. Nothing intellectually challenging but it has character development and the story line is typically engaging.,/review/rw4439151/?ref_=tt_urv

20 December 2010,wright7700,10," ""Get them off my Island""
","I can't say enough good about this show and its actors. All four of the major characters were well chosen and show a great range of emotions, allowing for considerable character development. In one episode, we learn more about where all four of them than we did in the original series from 1968-80. Their acting ability and range would allow for big screen versions of the show.",/review/rw4439151/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2010,garrard,5," Comparing the pilots of the two ""Hawaii 5-0's""
","Now that the first installment of the ""new"" Hawaii 5-0 is history, it's time to do a little comparison to show how different it is from its predecessor, a difference that is not for the better.",/review/rw4439151/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2011,cosmic_quest,8," Highly entertaining cop show
","I have never seen an episode of the original 'Hawaii Five-O' (although I will certainly give it a go if it is ever repeated on television) so I have no preconceptions of what to expect with this rebooted version. However, I do love American cop shows and have been looking forward to this since I first heard it was being produced. For those unfamiliar with the premise, the show is set in Hawaii and centres on a newly formed police unit consisting of ex-Navy SEAL Steve McGarrett, New Jersey detective Danny Williams (who has grudgingly moved to Hawaii to be with his young daughter), wrongly disgraced Hawaiian detective Chin Ho Kelly and his rookie cousin Kono Kalakaua (who, apparently, was a guy in the 1970s version but is played by Grace Park in this version).",/review/rw4439151/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2022,Spoocus,9," HEAT SHOW
",This show is an absolute unit of media. From the action scenes to the award winning dialog you get pretty much everything with this show. One episode you are cheering for the team to take out a international terrorist the next your crying because some random person you just meet in the show dies. I've watched all 10 seasons with my family and we have never gotten old of it. By far can say dis da best cop show no cap. We got like 4 seasons of this show on disk and as a family we all watch when it do be raining when we go camping. We have also been to Hawaii where they film and seen them filming and its a sight to see.,/review/rw4439151/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2010,afijamesy2k,2," So Silly, it's a crime
","The Remake of the theme song is the only reason to see this idiotically, godawful, disjointed remake of the great 1968-80 television classic, Alex McLoughlin delivers a very bad performance, the rest of the actors are woeful, scott cann is embarrassing, the rest of the scenes are just so pointless, the action is over the top, the writing is embarrassing, the teleplay is a mess and the only things that save this disasters are the beautiful scenery of Hawaii, the theme songs and the cinematography, otherwise this is a pointless, useless exercise in stupidity that deserves to be on my list of the worst TV of 2010.",/review/rw4439151/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2010,Right-Wing-Man,10," Hawaii Five-O Nice!
","I was around for the original series, although I was only about 5 or 6 at the time, but I still watched it with my folks and liked the original series. Now as I look back, I find that the original I can't even watch anymore... how the times have changed.",/review/rw4439151/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2019,Taleann,4," Ran out of actors, hiring cardboard characters
","Have you guys run out of actors? Or the budget? Is it that bad, you had to hire one-dimensional cardboard characters? It's impossible not only to like Tani and Junior but even slightly care about them. Season 8 is an epic failure, and while I had to close my eyes on the whole disastrous Doris sideline, this time the show went from 7 to 4 stars, and who knows where it ends up. It's really disappointing and looks like it's the beginning of the end for you.",/review/rw4439151/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2019,jbredd-762-863845,3," Doris
",Why in the world did they bring Doris back on the show? She's even more obnoxious than Dano (James Caan) and that's pretty bad. Sorry have a hard time with those two.,/review/rw4439151/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2019,prabathii,4," This show sucks big time without Chin and Kono
","This show sucks big time without Chin and Kono. What were they thinking, bringing on two new unrelated characters out of the air? Failed to secure pay parity? Seriously? It's not going to last long at this rate.",/review/rw4439151/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2013,HelenMary,7," Exciting television with a fair bit of eye candy
","Love this show! I was a fan of Alex O'Loughlin in Moonlight (guilty pleasure), and he's just delicious in this; cool, calm and collected, fast, good with a gun and awesome looking in uniform. Add to that, brilliant other characters in this Hawaii-50 remake including the iconic Danno (Scott Caan) and also lovely and determined Chin Ho Kelly (Daniel Dae Kim) and gorgeous and kick-ass Kono (Grace Park). Each episode is part of a larger story arc but is an exciting and gripping adventure or case, where the bad guys are brought down, they often go undercover and use technology, contacts, and a few good smack downs to get what they need done. The scripts aren't always A1 but the dialogue is sufficient and often funny, but without the over-cheesy CSI lines that make you want to throw things at the TV, and it's not predictable or overly stylised with set pieces. There's also great stunts and car chases, it's exciting television that isn't mindless or pointless. It's also nice because despite the violence, it's not gratuitous in other ways and is good (older) family entertainment set in beautiful Hawaii with gorgeous vistas and scenery, beaches and surfing; pretty good advertising for the island actually!",/review/rw4439151/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2018,dlmvegas,1," Still Boring after Not Watching for 2 years
","I stopped watching this show a couple years ago. Got tired of the useless and stupid conversations with Danno and Steve & the lack of local people on the show. Still pissed about them screwing over Grace Park & Daniel Dae Kim. If they were to get rid of anybody it should have been Danno's character. He always seemed to be not a big fan of the locals on the islands. I don't care if his father was a big name actor or not. Grace and Daniel also made up the 4 person team as equally as the other two members. Obviously the sorry people who produce the show treated them like second class citizens in the end. Moving along, I decided to kill some time and watch the first episode of the current ninth season. Still the same stupid, waste of time conversations going on. None of them are funny. Nor do they contribute to the show whatsoever. At least they added a couple people who look like locals. Probably screwed them on the salaries as well. As it has been said, move along nothing to see here. After 10 minutes of agony of the ninth season opener I turned it off and went to bed.",/review/rw4439151/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2018,mikejade-35453,6," They argue like a married couple
