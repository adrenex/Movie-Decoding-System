16 June 2009,bkoganbing,9," Barrio Epic
","Based on the real life experiences of poet Jimmy Santiago Baca, Bound By Honor covers two decades in the latter half of the 20th century as seen through the eyes of half brothers Benjamin Bratt and Jesse Borrego and their cousin Damian Chapa. Growing up more or less together, all three start out as gang bangers, but each has a different destiny and in many ways one's destiny is caused by the actions of the others.",/review/rw4807276/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2007,felicia-blake,," Blood In Blood Out - Criminally under-rated!
","I first saw this film a few years ago when my brother stumbled across it in a bargain basement basket bin! What a travesty for a start that it had not made a bigger mark at the box office and had been consigned to a cheap basket! I'm sure if released with more fanfare this time it would reach the audience it deserves! It is a story of rival gangs, family, love, betrayal, loyalty, acceptance - every film clich√© you could think of.",/review/rw4807276/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2019,mikeadriano,10," Terribly under-rated Epic
","It's an awesome epic worth your time and patience. Some viewers complain that this an American Me rip off and its way too long, yes there are similarities but it is told in a different manner, I thought the 190 minutes(Directors cut) flew by. There are numerous cheesy lines, racial stereotypes and the acting can be over the top, sometimes wooden but its what makes this epic work and enjoyable. A must watch for those who enjoy hood/barrio movies.",/review/rw4807276/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2013,siderite,8," Surprisingly deep
","At first glance one feels this is a TV movie, starting with a sunny day somewhere in east LA and a guy coming in and greeting anyone in Spanish, with colorful Mexicans all over. You may think, based on the movie title as well, that it will be one of those gang action movies where the hero beats up everybody. It certainly starts that way, but the movie is not like that.",/review/rw4807276/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2000,jhopp21,8," Vatos Locos forever
","This is one of those most people saw by mistake, late one night on cable. I did too, and found myself talking about it for weeks.  The only thing that keeps this movie from being rated higher is its length.  At times it is too drawn out, but for the most part it is well acted, beautifully shot considering the settings, and tells a good story.",/review/rw4807276/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2000,wigz,10," probably my favorite
","I've seen this movie about twenty times and would gladly watch it again anytime.Literally.Damian Chapa has been robbed of any real recognition for what I think is one of the best performances ever to be put on film.Miklo rules.I've never seen the extended laserdisc,but I'm sure it kicks even more ass. This movie will survive the test of time.",/review/rw4807276/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2005,mrminimite,9," A ""love it or hate it"" type of flick
","Bound By Honor (BBH) is not meant to legitimize or glorify gang life, or ennoble Latino culture. It simply tells a story that faithfully paraphrases harsh reality. If you don't get the story, then it's easy to lambaste the acting and directing. If you do get the story, then the acting and directing are good enough.",/review/rw4807276/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2001,dinky26,," Interesting watch
","I've seen this movie a couple of times and its got its good points and its bad.  It's an interesting story, though generally, it perpetuates the ""East L.A. gang member"" stereotype.  However, it also addresses something I haven't seen before in a movie of this type, and something that was perfectly illustrated (unintentionally) by some of the unfavorable reviews posted here.  I'm referring to the character of Miklos, and how stereotypes within his own community about ""what is Latin"" contribute to the person he becomes.  There have been a few reviewers here who feel that the character of Miklos was not believable as Latino, as he was ""too"" white looking.  As I understand, that was exactly the point.  He was always having to prove himself as 'more latin than thou' because of his fair skin.  Somehow being 'more latin than thou' became akin to being a hardest of the hard gang member. I think that was the most compelling idea out of the movie because that sort of thing happens quite often.  Many Latinos subscribe to the stereotype that ""all latinos are a sort of medium brown"".  Forgetting that ""Latino"" is not a race.  It refers to ethnicity.  You can be of any race and still be Latino. Those who don't fit into the stereotype of appearance sometimes try to find another way to 'be more Latin', and become susceptible to other, more insidious stereotypes. I've known my fair share of blue eyed blond ""Miklos"" who felt compelled to prove their ""Latin-ness"" by being a thug. So despite what has to be a record usage of the word ""ese"", I found this movie a worthy viewing due to the addressing of this topic.",/review/rw4807276/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2007,disaia-1,10," Pleasantly Surprised.
","I saw this movie by chance and was expecting it to be some low budget flick with gang fights in it, but I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie was. I put the DVD in and was planning to only watch a few minutes before going to bed, but the movie was so good and interesting that I watched the whole thing.",/review/rw4807276/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2004,thefensk,," Mixed reviews
","I am quite often moved to comment when a movie has a wide range of good to bad reviews.  This movie is a classic case.  Several people called it the worst movie they had ever seen, or words to that effect.  Is it?  Hardly. It also isn't the best movie ever made. It is long, I'll grant the complaints about that, but one of the beauties of video is you don't have to watch it all at one time.  Over-acted?  I think that has to do with the genre.

","Not many people have seen the movie over here in Holland, but the people that have seen it, love it. the movie is complete! the story is great, the acting at some times a bit overdone but it doesnt hurt the movie at all. The movie changed the lives of many friends and myself.. It's just the best movie ever.

4 February 2011,tnrcooper,9," criminally underrated film
","This film really is a peer of The Godfather. It should be thought of in those terms. Both films track members of a family who are in mob-like organizations. ""Blood In, Blood Out"" tracks the fate of family members involved in gangs but some of whom try to go straight, while The Godfather is more concerned with the internal machinations of the criminal organization.",/review/rw4807276/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2007,tdb-8,9," great story, nice and long so one can enjoy it more than the average flick
","i believe that is one of the better movies ever to come out. a truly amazing story of what life can entail between brothers and how the choices you make defines your direction in life. OK, one might argue that it is rather cheap in the budgetary sense and consequently not a respectable director nor actors are in it makes the flick only more interesting. The acting is however quite good and the prisoners are more than realistic. In other words it gives a nice insight in US (prison-gang)life. On top of that i personally am a great fan of true stories as this is. it is a shame that bad distribution has not given this the place in movie history that it deserves.",/review/rw4807276/?ref_=tt_urv

","Rarely in my life I find myself glued to my seat for an entire movie, not to mention to one over 3 hours long one. This is one I did so twice: once 6 years years ago and the second time about a year ago.  I love the work of Taylor Heckford, he is a great storyteller and a brilliant director.",/review/rw4807276/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2005,whpratt1,10," An Amazing Film
","Recently viewed this film which was called, ""Blood In Blood Out"" and could hardly believe the great details and realistic way this film was produced. There is no doubt that it showed what Prison Life really is like among all races, Black, Brown, White and many more and how each group has to struggle to exist and at the same time have fun, make money and kill each other. If you wanted sex in prison, you had plenty of willing partners and it just might be a very difficult and hard way to deal with it, or just simply getting raped when you least expect it. A young guy gets out of jail and tries to go down the straight and narrow path and winds up losing a body part and is constantly trying to become a gang member. There is a guy who has a great ability of being an artist, drawing great paintings and he gets cut up and his back twisted like a pretzel. If you want to go to prison, watch this film and it just might change your mind completely. Plenty of action and it goes none stop through out the entire picture.",/review/rw4807276/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2019,RocknRollCEO,10," A Criminally Under Promoted Masterpiece
","There are certain movies that are made so beautifully, they move you to your core. From the opening titles to the closing lines and credits, Blood In Blood Out is a complete masterpiece. How it was overlooked and didn't get the recognition it deserves is an indication of how the movie industry operates.
Whether you enjoy the gang / prison movie genre or not, this movie will touch you, even if only from a cinematic perspective. It is a genuine work of art.",/review/rw4807276/?ref_=tt_urv

30 July 2020,shanayneigh,9," I absolutely love this movie
","This movie isn't a guilty pleasure, it's simply a pleasure to watch. Melodramatic and full of hammy acting (here's looking at you, Damian Chapa) but goddamn is it entertaining and full of amazing quotes (whenever a buddy does something weird in traffic, it's still a chicano u-turn to us).",/review/rw4807276/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2003,=G=,6," A tinseltown take on Chicano gang/prison life
","""Bound by Honor"" circles interminably around a trio of East L.A.  Chicano gang members through decades of life. Overwrought,  over acted, uninspired, and fraught with foibles and plotholes,  the film spends too much time wallowing in the numbing excesses of prison gang life and politics unable to escape the varnish and tarnish of a Hollywood contrived shock-value execution. Even if we needed another prison gang flick, which we don't, this flick accomplishes too little and runs too long wearing its characters down to nubs instead of fleshing them out with insights into familia, community, heritage, and church. Worst of all, we're not given anyone to care about leaving us with three hours of mechanical detachment. (C+)",/review/rw4807276/?ref_=tt_urv
