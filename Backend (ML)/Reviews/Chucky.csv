13 January 2008,IridescentTranquility,9," A bit rushed in places but otherwise perfect, a great-looking serial
","I very much enjoyed this adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. I believe the trick to reviewing adaptations is to compare them with the book and not to any earlier filmed offerings. While I love the 1995 version, there are some parts of this adaptation that are as good as (sometimes better than) that film.",/review/rw2423469/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2008,MOscarbradley,8," Another feather in the BBC's cap
","Praising the BBC for the quality of their costume dramas may be the equivalent of taking coals to Newcastle but in some respects it's what they do best and ""Sense and Sensibility"" is no exception. Of course, comparisons with Ang Lee's splendid film version are inevitable yet somehow the intimacy of television and the somewhat greater length that a serialized adaptation can afford gives this a deeper dimension that the albeit very entertaining film version.",/review/rw2423469/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2008,galensaysyes,8," My favorite version, especially for Elinor and Marianne
","This serial, like Pride and Prejudice and Emma by the same scriptwriter, is my favorite rendition of its novel. In the first hour it's my favorite by far; in the rest, just my favorite.",/review/rw2423469/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2008,sissoed,6," Deficient characterizations mar otherwise fine acting and production values
","One of the essentially unique and appealing aspects of Jane Austen is that the hallmark of a good person is constant awareness of the feelings others are experiencing, and the desire never to cause those feelings to be painful or embarrassing. Part I of this new ""Sense and Sensibility"" fails to capture this important quality: there are several instances in which each of the ""good"" characters are profoundly insensitive to the feelings they are triggering in others. This version doesn't realize that in Austen, good manners have moral significance, because they protect feelings. Part II is better, and avoids this problem.",/review/rw2423469/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2008,pawebster,8," Entertaining new version
","This is a good new version. I'm surprised it was made, since the one with Emma Thompson is still quite fresh in people's minds.",/review/rw2423469/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,9," Beautiful to look at and well acted, rushed at times but overall a fine mini-series
","The book ""Sense and Sensibility"" is a great one. It is beautiful, poised and poignant and just a joy to read. Out of the adaptations of the book I have two favourites. One is the 1995 film with Kate Winslet and Emma Thompson, which was visually stunning and impeccably acted by the whole cast. The other adaptation is this one. I do marginally prefer the film, but this mini-series is mighty fine.",/review/rw2423469/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2008,ligiaruscu,7," miniseries usually truer to the book than feature films; not this one
","Jane Austen sells well these days, which goes a long way towards explaining the appalling number of film adaptations let loose upon us over the past years. This miniseries, part of this and last years' (2007-2008) batch that includes a lousy Mansfield Park, an adequate Northanger Abbey and an uneven Persuasion, dwells in the long shadows of the 1995 adaptation. On the one hand, it goes to considerable lengths in trying to avoid any resemblance: it does this by including scenes that were absent there (most notably the last encounter between Elinor and Willoughby, where he explains his conduct) and excluding, where possible, scenes that were present there; by having the film begin with a steamy sex scene for which there is no reason other than the hope of whetting the appetite of the viewers; by casting as Elinor an actress as unlike the brilliant Emma Thompson as possible (and whose idea of conveying dramatic tension seems to be to open her eyes very wide and sometimes also her mouth, slightly). On the other hand though, the adaptation has been taking over ideas that occur in the 1995 film and not in the book: like turning Margaret into a well rounded and likable character, which in the book she is not (this is understandable; everybody loves cute little girls with lots of curly hair), like Edward's proposal to Elinor being received with a crying fit (which was not a very good idea to begin with). Talented actors, loving attention to period details and National Trust mansions do not by themselves a good film make. This miniseries has chosen to show Marianne falling rather early in love with Colonel Brandon. This is not only not true to the book (where it is at no point implied that Marianne holds feelings for him other than esteem and gratitude), it also waters down and distorts the core message of the story. If Marianne can overcome her feelings for Willoughby so quickly and easily, then they were not the deep love we had been hitherto led to believe, but just the trifling infatuation one (especially parents) would ordinarily expect from most seventeen-year-olds. Then, her deep distress and the illness that almost cost her life are but the tantrum of a spoiled child denied a treat. Accordingly, there is no lesson to be learned of the story, no proper appreciation of Elinor's self-control, no triumph of sense over sensibility. Admittedly, most people these days expect to be entertained, not educated by books and films (unless it were about sex), but Jane Austen deserves better treatment than this. Andrew Davies has certainly come a long way since his celebrated 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, and not all of it seems to have been good to him.",/review/rw2423469/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2008,peterquennell,10," Jolt of a lifetime...
","Truth is, my wife is (was) the family's one Jane Austen addict so I had zero inkling up-front of the two truly extraordinary story arcs. To say that this production is one wild, nail-biting roller-coaster ride is putting it pretty mildly.",/review/rw2423469/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2008,johnmcc150,7," Good looking, well -acted but over-compressed
","Perhaps we are getting used to Andrew Davies's adaptations but I think he was below par here, perhaps because of the short duration. This version had what are known as ""high production values"", ie it looked good and was well-acted. However Jane Austen's dialogue and characterisation really lost out when compressed into three episodes. Andrew Davies would rightly say that 21st century television is a very different medium from an early nineteenth century novel. In its own terms, therefore, as a TV drama it was quite good, as bonnet-fests go. However if you had never read the book, you would have probably thought that much fuss has been made over a fairly uninteresting story. I guess you could compress Sense & Sensibility still further until people would believe that Jane Austen was first published by Mills and Boon.",/review/rw2423469/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2011,runamokprods,7," Good, but not quite great version
","A solid adaptation that didn't quite match up to the Ang Lee and Emma Thompson film. That had more energy, pace, intensity and humor. This is more lyrical and gentle, which works almost as well... for a while. ",/review/rw2423469/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2008,strezise,7," wonderful cast and settings, but a poor screenplay
","I loved the look of this adaptation of the novel and thought almost all the characters were ideally cast. In fact, I can't imagine a better Elinor, and the rest of the Dashwood family was close to ideal. As usual the BBC found lovely settings, though the cottage is too basic to be believable and too close to the sea (!): Austen's concept of a cottage was a great deal more than this (four reception rooms downstairs, I believe). The problem is the screenplay, which trivialises so much of the novel, fails to understand some of its basic premises, and relies on visual titillation at the expense of the dialogue that was much more in evidence in the BBC's generally superior previous attempt. The moral of the story, both implied in this adaptation and explicit in the book, is to do with the dangers of excessive sensibility and not editing your feelings in order to conform to social conditions. It is not to do with what you do being more important than what you feel, as Marianne puts it during her sudden, Stepford-wife transformation to rationality. Her illness is not physical, and certainly has nothing to do with the ridiculous scene in the rain Davies has devised: it is in her mind. The whole point of the story is to show the danger of over-indulging one's feelings and disengaging from society. Davies: read the book again, and even if the book is to be changed, at least be consistent. The end product here was, I believe, a dumbing down of one of the most miraculous stories of the very early nineteenth century.",/review/rw2423469/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2008,inkblot11,7," It makes sense to say this was a successful miniseries but it is nowhere near the perfection of the Ang Lee-Emma Thompson version
","In newly 19th century England, a family of three daughters is put into turmoil when the father dies. You see, the young ladies are the offspring of the man's second marriage and the main inheritor of his estate is his son from the first one. This leaves poor Elinor (Hattie Morahan), Marianne (Charity Wakefield) and their much younger sister Margaret, along with their mother, with far less means of existence. They are forced to move out of the family home and seek smaller accommodations in the country. Alas, also, their prospects for a ""good"" marriage are likewise dimmed, as they have no sizeable dowries. Nevertheless, upon their move to a charming cottage in the countryside, the girls meet two marriageable men. One of them, Colonel Brandon, is a thirty-something, wealthy landowner whose still-single status is the result of a broken engagement long ago. However, he is instantly smitten with the musically gifted, outspoken Marianne. Yet, the age difference may prove to be a barrier. Elinor, too, meets a most eligible man, Edward, the brother of their catty sister-in-law but, here again, something is amiss. He becomes extremely close to the more reserved Elinor, only to remove himself from the situation, for some unknown reason. Enter Willoughby. He is a handsome man who gallops into their lives on the day he rescues Marianne from a sprained ankle. Marianne's heart is lost to this gentleman, but, he may have some big secrets to hide. Will the sisters meet a good fate or a bad one? This is a very nice miniseries, with some attractive stars and some nice settings and costumes. The actor playing Colonel Brandon, especially, bears a striking resemblance to Liam Neeson and will set hearts to flutter. Yet, to anyone who has seen the Ang Lee film, with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet, this one pales in a close comparison of the two. There is no sweeping score, no gorgeous cinematography, no amazing art direction and no Hugh Grant. That is not to say it does not have its moments or that it will not please most fans of Austen, who would be content to see a new version every year for the rest of their lives. In such light, do try to catch this new adaptation, either on Masterpiece Theatre or when it is released on DVD, if you are a devotee of Jane's works. You will hang on every word and feel great contentment as the film fades to black.",/review/rw2423469/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2008,alexlotrfan,9," A great TV mini-series.
","I totally disagree with all the negative comments about this film. I mean, it was a little rushed at times, especially at the end. However, all in all it was a great film to watch and you did not feel in any way that Elinor and Marrianne married the wrong men! In the Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant version, I think you get the impression that Elinor should marry Col. Brandon!",/review/rw2423469/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2012,orinocowomble,4," Lecter Meets Austen
","While this film was shot in stunning locations making it a visual feast, that's not enough to carry a three-hour miniseries. Particularly when Mr Davies has cannibalised whole passages from the 1995 script by Emma Thompson. I hope he had her permission to ""quote"" at least, since he lifts exact lines from her work again and again--not to mention incidents, and even camera shots that were repeated from the earlier film, almost frame for frame. It is interesting that even the voice and intonations of the actress playing Elinor resonate heavily with Thompson's own performance. ",/review/rw2423469/?ref_=tt_urv

30 June 2009,canuckteach,10," Knocked me over...!
","Caught this on a weekly PBS presentation - was glued to it at once. Had to buy the DVD, and re-watch it a few times over. It's so good, we discovered, by accident, that you could listen to the DVD with no picture, and enjoy it as a radio drama with amazing sound effects (branches waving in the breeze, birds singing). So lifelike were the performances, I started dreaming about the characters.",/review/rw2423469/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2008,didi-5,6," good points and bad points in yet another Austen

29 December 2018,skywise-47169,9," Beautifully played
","I have read the book, seen the 1995 movie adaptation, but this series was so beautifully played, the emotion conveyed was so impressive.

",I just saw this mere hours ago and I couldn't get it out of my head. I'd like to start off by saying that I read the book and then saw the 1995 version of Sense and Sensibility and couldn't imagine what could top it. It's simple: this mini-series.,/review/rw2423469/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2013,maryplayspiano,5," Not good for fans of the novel

","""Sense & Sensibility"" (2008) directed by John Alexander, is an excellent BBC version of a great novel. I have just watched--and reviewed for IMDb--the 1971 version, also done by BBC.

17 September 2018,stefaniedonaghy,8," Quite enjoyable and impressive
","I've only recently been bitten by the Jane Austen bug. Having never been interested in anything historical, I'm suddenly into all of it, Jane Austen in particular. I think Outlander was my gateway book! Anyhoo, I have not yet read this book or have I seen the 1995 film, and this is my only account of the story. So maybe that's why I enjoyed it so much, because I didn't have anything to compare it to. Other than that first weird pseudo sex scene, I thought it was wonderful. Well written, well acted, the whole bit.",/review/rw2423469/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2011,marspeach,9," My favorite version of S&S
","Although S&S 2008 is now my favorite version of Sense and Sensibility, my thoughts were very different upon my first viewing! I saw it as it was airing in the UK on a poor quality streaming video, only able to watch bits at a time between classes. I just couldn't wait for it to air here in the US. I was so disappointed and thought it was too dark and copied too much from the 1995 version, which I liked but was not entirely satisfied with (read my review to see why). It wasn't until I got the DVD this past Christmas that I noticed everything that made me like it. It was dark, yes, but it was only the bad quality of the stream that made it hard to see! I watched a behind-the-scenes video that they hadn't intended to make everything ""dark and stormy"" but there was bad weather all the time during filming and they decided to go with that look! As for the copying from the 1995 version, yes, there were some parts from it, not in the book, that Andrew Davies also included in this, and while I could definitely do without them, they don't stop me from enjoying the show! On my rewatch I noticed so many other things that made me love it! The main thing that I love about this movie is its wonderful (with a couple exceptions), more age-appropriate cast. This version really excelled in its portrayal of the relationship between Elinor and Marianne, which is really the main focus of the book. In all the previous versions, one of the sisters always left me cold. This is the only one in which I like BOTH actresses! It wasn't perfect. I wasn't a fan of the elements lifted from the 1995 version and all Andrew Davies' usual sexed up scenes, but I still love this version.",/review/rw2423469/?ref_=tt_urv
