18 February 2022,moviebender,10," Absolute Masterpiece
","Absolute Masterpiece of storytelling, gameplay and graphics! As a big fan of the first HZD game and the stellar actually very possible story of mankind I was worried how the development team would translate and link the story into the second game. Now after couple of hours into it I absolutely can tell you they did another masterpiece of game and story here. Well done Guerrilla and Sony! Absolute must have and play for this season. And let the non-gamers be jealous they will never experience this kind of story and graphics pleasure.",/review/rw8237713/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2022,Honodi,7," A good game that i just didn't really enjoy as much as zero dawn.
","Let's be very clear here, H:FW is a very beautiful game, the landscape is amazing, the character animations are great, and i could not point to something in the game that was at odds with itself (everything was coherent and made sense in the Horizon World).",/review/rw8237713/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2022,ilpo-surokivi,10," Amazing
","This game is just amazing! I would leave it at that but I just want to tell you more. Even if I don't agree with the policies of the developer and I don't support fascism that wants to make people silent based on their political opinions just because someone's emotions are hurt, I have to say that Guerrilla Games knows how to make games and amazing storytelling.",/review/rw8237713/?ref_=tt_urv

11 March 2022,bakerstreetdozen,8," Great sequel, but suffers from unnecessary additions
","I really enjoyed the first game and this was my most anticipated game in awhile. I can't say I'm exactly disappointed, it's extremely fun. But there are certain changes that they made that just...didn't need to be made. Like fixing a problem that didn't exist.",/review/rw8237713/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2022,namyers-31561,10," Worth every drop of hype
","Holy heck. This game is STUNNING. Easily the most beautiful looking game I've ever played. Brilliant story, well written and intriguing characters, challenging combat, tons of side activities, easy and fun to get lost just exploring/hunting, and just purely phenomenal. Aloy's return is glorious.",/review/rw8237713/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2022,krismancini,9," An example.
",An example of how you nail a sequel. Great game. Didn't love playing the first one. But loved this one. I don't even consider myself a single-player gamer. I just historically always play Multiplayer. But this game sucked me in!,/review/rw8237713/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2022,ruippfonseca,10," Amazing!!
","One of the best games ever! Must play to understand, unbelievable!! Love it, took 30 hours to get to the end, but it's certain I will play much more than that!! Congratulations to the studio who have made this masterpiece!!",/review/rw8237713/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,andreichirita1,10," One of the best epic sci-fi series, continued
","Waiting five long years to roam again with Aloy in one of the most original post-apocalyptic worlds ever created was certainly worth it. Just about everything is now better, and, while it was obvious that nothing could compare with Aloy's anagnorisis from the first game, the story is still a delight for the sci-fi fan.",/review/rw8237713/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2022,mbornastier,9," A stunningly beautiful sequel
","Aloy is back to try to figure how to reboot GAIA, new friends, new enemies, and lots of machines to destroy. The scenery is beautiful, the soundtrack is amazing, and the world even more expansive. I'm not even half way through the game yet, but I am in awe of this masterpiece. If you loved Zero Dawn, you'll definitely love Forbidden West. Oh, and Aloy is still my spirit animal. Now, I must go, there's a cauldron I need to make my way into.",/review/rw8237713/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2022,VeronikaWolfQueen,10," It got better, but I hated the ending
","Since this review turned out to be so incredibly long, I've gotten rid of the original review, it's not important. I've got it saved to my notes for posterity.",/review/rw8237713/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2022,saaiakani-822-89518,10," A Powerful Entry in Horizon: Zero Dawn
","With upgrades to every aspect of the game- gameplay, AI, upgrade systems, skill trees, and graphics, Horizon Forbidden West was an absolute triumph. Cauldrons are no longer wash-rinse-repeat; stories you encounter and engage in require real choices; the decisions you make will affect the way the ending plays out. In over 30 years of experience in gaming, I cannot recall any other sequel being as strong a follow up as this. I cannot recommend it enough.",/review/rw8237713/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2022,parrot007,6," Extremely Overrated and Undeniably Formuleic
","This game isnt bad but its been super overrated because we're in a drought for good triple A games right now. There is nothing here that you haven't already seen in a open world game. Graphics are a 10/10, world design is beautiful. Combat and progession are fun, but still virtually identical to the first game.",/review/rw8237713/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2022,chrisherne-47115,," Excellent sequel to an astoundingly good game
","If you like open world RPGs then there really isn't one better than the Horizon arc. It's highly immersive with third person gameplay and compared to the first game in the series, it's bigger, richer with interactions and side quests, and has far more developed gameplay interactions with respect to combat and navigating the social and physical world. The protagonist is Aloy, a clone of the main scientist that developed the means for all life on Earth to be given a second chance after a 'whoops apocalypse' mistake by the 'Old Ones', who was made as a desperate measure by the AI controlling the terraforming system when, for reasons yet unknown, the AI is destroyed and everything starts to go haywire, threatening life on Earth once again. The visible instruments of this terraforming system are machines with a wide variety of terraforming jobs and physical forms from dinosaurs to cattle, which have run amok with no AI to guide them. The machines and some other characters that she meets get in the way of Aloy's mission; and they have to be destroyed, overridden and used for transport, or circumvented by other means. If you've never played it before you're in for a long-lasting treat. If you haven't played the original game, I would recommend you start there, as it is just as enjoyable and will add context.",/review/rw8237713/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,michalklebs,9," Artistic and technical masterpiece
","New technical benchmark in open world video games. This game has the best and most cinematic cut-scenes I've ever seen, one of the best combat mechanics and world building. I would give it a 10 if not for scenario: Zero Dawn story was more impactful and compelling, probably due to surprise factor. Also Aloy became too much of a superhero instead of actually interesting character - companions are more like her fans or annoying attachments. Apart from that - amazing experience.",/review/rw8237713/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2022,carsondriller,8," Good game
","This game is great. The story is very impressive, and I'd honestly say it's better than the first, but there's one thing that it lacks in: the open world. Not the graphics or the scenery, those are both beautiful, but the actual gameplay part of the open world. There's not enough to do in it, turning the game into mindless traveling with occasional side quests, and lots of the same enemies over and over again. The open world aspect of the game is bland and repetitive, making it no greater than an 8.4 for me very similar to Shin Megami Tensei V and Assassin's Creed Valhalla. Games like this should choose quality over quantity. When you look at open world maps like Skyrim or the Legends of Zelda series as a whole, you know that the world could be so much bigger but it's still way better than a game like this because almost every foot you walk through those worlds you find something with quality to do. There's none of that here.",/review/rw8237713/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2022,scotrutherford,9," Stunning Sequel
","I've never seen a more gorgeous game. Add to that an incredible story of epic depth and breadth, as well as phenomenal voice acting. The only thing they need to fix is go less shooter and more melee. They tend to over complicate battles- my favourite example: doing well in melee enables you you to switch to a bow attack. You're in close range people. Upgrade your ram if you like this kind of silliness. Other than that some serious hard, brilliant work went into the tribes, customs and cultures Aloy encounters. It's the best game out there at present.",/review/rw8237713/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2022,powerupdenver,10," Just beat it
","I have to say, one of the best games I have ever played. From sound, lighting, story, HDR color, voice acting, environment, leveling up, side quest, weapons, stash, music, hunting,...all of it was spectacular. The art work involved is mind blowing, the fast travel made the game feel extremely progressive. The character development was great. The game made me want to complete pretty much every side mission. Do not miss out on this incredible adventure.",/review/rw8237713/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2022,vicaramelie,6," Incredible presentation and narrative, with an abundance of issues
","The core formula from the first game is here, which still works very well, but a lot has been implemented that left a bad taste in my mouth. Additionally, the way the game is played and the performance on PS4 are both subpar compared to the first game and similar titles.",/review/rw8237713/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2022,slider9499,7," Too Slow. Too Comlicated. Too Many Options, Add-ons and Very Confusing
","Way too slow
way too many cut scenes
way too complicated
massive problems with the jump button - constant falls that should never happen
way too many options, add-ons, on-screen notes & directions
very confusing
boring story
extremely hard to follow
not nearly as good as the first one
overrated.",/review/rw8237713/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2022,tommyodinsson,7," Not worth $70
","Wait until a sale comes to buy this game, or at least until the update it. The graphics are great and the world is beautiful but my immersion is always ruined by the various bugs this game has to offer, and and overall bland side quests. Another issue I have is that the gameplay is way too similar compared to Horizon: Zero Dawn, they barely added anything new if there is anything. The story here is great so I'll give it a 7.3, but fans shouldn't be blinded by the new release to see the flaws that hide within it. You'll get a lot more out of games like Persona 5 Royal, Skyrim, or if you're looking for new releases, Lost Judgement.",/review/rw8237713/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2022,frankie-smales,6," Great premise but way too much cliches
","This game has an great premise sadly it has way too
Many cliches that's been done to death like spoiling
The reveal way to early like how Aloy explained to
Varl fan favourite from the original game that she
isn't created at birth but as some genetic experiment
and the only hope of survival from the DNA of scientist
Elisabet sobeck and how Aloy isn't the only clone but
another one it sounds like you see in other science
fiction stories about cloning others including way to
Heavy on doing fetch quests then doing the main
objective and relying on cartoon humour and yes
Expect stereotyping of characters in this game and
An long start for the story to kick off but very
Disappointing story narrative great for Friday night

14 June 2022,justjayreid,9," Fantastic, frustrating, frickin good!
",I'm not doing the franchise a service since I haven't played the first. Truth is my girlfriend brought me a PS5 and this game (is never heard of the franchise properly) and I thought screw it I'll bite. And BOY WAS THAT A MEAL. I'm stuffed.,/review/rw8237713/?ref_=tt_urv
