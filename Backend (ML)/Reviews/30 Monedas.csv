23 April 2018,subxerogravity,7," Worth taking a look at
","So much more than what I was expecting. If you saw the trailer to this movie, not only does it barely scrape the surface of what's going on but it's a little misleading to what the film is really about. It's not the best movie in the world, as it's a little too obviously being used as a vehicle for Paula Patton (who also produced it) to show how well she can do in the driver's seat as a leading lady, but the overall direction it's heading down was very satisfying to see.",/review/rw4337025/?ref_=tt_urv

3 May 2018,zardoz-13,1," An Inept Human Trafficking Melodrama
","Laudable though their intentions, ""Supremacy"" writer-director Deon Taylor and star-producer Paula Patton have forged a half-baked abduction opus ""Traffik"" about domestic and international sex slavery rings out of a second-rate romantic thriller. Just because a movie tackles a prominent issue of social relevance, such as human trafficking, doesn't make it appropriate as a cheap thrills melodrama for an evening's entertainment. Despite some familiar actors and actresses, this 96-minute, R-rated, Lionsgate/Summit Entertainment release is something you can wait for until it shows up on a streaming service for a quarter of the cost of tickets and concession at a theater. The problem with Taylor's amateurish screenplay is it meanders without purpose when he should have narrowed its focus on the theme and abandoned all other the contrivances that slow everything down. Some characters could have been eliminated from the start as well as many of the complications that together generate one convolution after another. Moreover, Taylor introduces things that raise expectations, and then he dispenses with them as if they lacked significance. If you've seen better movies or television shows about human trafficking, such as Steven Soderbergh's ""Traffic"" (2000) or the Liam Neeson ""Taken"" trilogy, you'll know what to expect long before this earnest, but inept thriller unfolds. One of the biggest ""Traffik"" flaws is its incoherence. The villains are presented casually without any level of ranking or classification. Never do we learn who is in-charge beyond the foot soldiers who do the abducting. Furthermore, the protagonist is a naïve journalist with little sense of urgency or spontaneity about what constitutes professional journalism. ""Traffik"" starts out as a romantic thriller and then abruptly shifts gears and turns into a human trafficking expose. The villains seem hopelessly shortsighted and easily conquered, while the heroine reaps the benefits of too many lucky breaks. Sometimes, in a film about an incandescent topic like trafficking, the filmmakers can enhance the impact of the subject matter if they ordain the deaths of the heroes and/or heroines. Consequently, audiences struggle with the bitter taste of defeat that accentuates the magnitude of abolishing this vile business.",/review/rw4337025/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2018,shirleyanthonynow,8," Traffik was Terrific
","This film captured the story line brilliantly it kept you on your guard and had at some points in the movie on the edge of your seat waiting for justice.

29 April 2018,bnemec-929-478125,1," Be Careful They Manipulated the Ratings on this one. It is really about a 4.
",Not sure what is going on here but the votes went way up but they aren't in the demographics. This movie is really bad. Fine for MoviePass but don't pay even a matinee price for this trash.,/review/rw4337025/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2018,Stars-and-popcorn,2," 'Traffik' is an Hour and A Half of People Making Dumb Decisions
","You ever watch a horror movie and wonder why anyone would make the stupid choices the main characters always seem to make in them? Well, 'Traffik' is over an hour and a half of that. Of course, most movie plots can't really progress unless the heroes are dumb as stumps. To make matters worse though, the characters in Traffik are so unlikeable that it's hard not to hope the bad guys get them, and those bad guys are racist, white trash, sex traffickers. So, that's really saying something.",/review/rw4337025/?ref_=tt_urv

",I would like to think I don't scare easily. This movie had unexpected twists & I loved it. I hated Paula's make-up & dingy ways in the beginning but I got over it. Really enjoyed the characters & story line.,/review/rw4337025/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2018,chengcheng202,," Regardless the movie quality, I recommend all girls should watch the movie
","This movie is based on a real case happened in North Cal, which is where I'm currently living. I used to think this kind of criminal - human traffic - would only take place in the area where it's far and less developed. However, this movie made me realize the hidden danger. I became more cautious like double check the front and back door lock every night before going to bed. I also began to avoid going to places in the middle of no where by myself (which I did a lot before). ",/review/rw4337025/?ref_=tt_urv

20 April 2018,GManfred,," *** Bad Vacation
","When I left the theater I tried to think of something positive to say about ""Traffik"", a banal 'slasher' flick now in theaters. But I couldn't. The screenplay is hackneyed, the script is awful and the acting ranges from average (Omar Epps) to below (Paula Patton). ""Traffik"" just doesn't have much going for it, but I went to the first matinee which is low-priced where I go.",/review/rw4337025/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,5," Sub-par directing, cheesy screenplay and mainly bad acting flop the potential this film had
","This film holds the record for the most fake reviews and ratings - even over a thousand likes on the fake reviews, which is impossible any of them saw this movie for an honest review.

","Home break-in, human trafficking, based on true story...blah. blah, blah. Same film, different back story. Two couples at a get away location owned by a sports agent. Bikers, Luke Goss bad guy and a twist we saw coming. Go watch a Liam Neeson film again instead. ",/review/rw4337025/?ref_=tt_urv

18 July 2018,bettycjung,6," Patton kicks butt
","7/17/18. This suspense thriller was slightly above average. That's because Patton did a good job of playing a can-do woman who can kick butt. Patton plays a somewhat disgruntled journalist who feels she is being passed over on the job probably for being a female reporter. While on a romantic getaway with her boyfriend (Epps), she is caught up in what appears to be a trafficking ring being run by some local bikers and others in town. She decides to turn investigative reporter and try to uncover what's going on, to the detriment of her boyfriend and a couple of friends who came along for the weekend. Alonzo's character was extremely annoying, and some of Patton's actions were not too swift. The action was pretty good though. Like I said, Patton knows how to kick butt.",/review/rw4337025/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2018,Damone82,2," Movie about sexploitation spends most of it focused sexualizing Paula Patton
","There's a new wave of great brothas out there writing and directing. As a black man, it's exciting to see brothas (and sistas) making moves and comin up. But this is another sad example of the mediocrity and drivel that gets funded and marketed, and then in turn sets black directors and writers back a few steps. The movie is boring. Nothing about this is tense or interesting. All the characters are one-dimensional, and predictable. Still not sure how an international sex trafficking ring really played that much into this. Oh, and what's with spelling it TRAFFIK? Traffick would have worked, and made more sense. But just like the title spelling, the rest of the movie didn't make sense. Omar Epps is straight to Blu Ray now, and they just went and found the most stereotypical white boys they could get. But Paula Patton....daaaymn. That girl is hot! But it's not worth the $$ just to see a few scenes with her in little clothing. The writer/director of this movie is the same dude that made other embarrassments like Chain Letter and Nite Tales. OH, and if you read his bio...dude lies. He didn't play at SDSU, he was there for one year and left because he wasn't a starter. He didn't get a degree there, either. And he didn't play pro ball. Everything about this movie, just like the director, is straight bulls**t. Don't waste your time, bruh.",/review/rw4337025/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2018,Tee_Espolon,," Just Awful
","This movie had the potential to really shed light on the serious issue of sex trafficking had it been provided with better direction/storyline. Instead it comes off as a cheesy teeny bopper ""let's go to my uncle's cabin in the woods"" b list horror film. There is nothing good about this film with the exception of Omar Epps acting. You will not be attached to any character in this film. You will find yourself yelling at the scream yelling ""Come On"" and wanting to slap and shoulder shake the main character from start to finish. Nothing in this movie is realistic. Watch this movie when you need a good laugh, feel like being frustrated or need a guide on everything absolutely not to ever do ever about anything.",/review/rw4337025/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2018,davesgordon,1," Cringeworthy acting. Impossible to watch
","It is rare with an undoubtedly over-saturated acting pool to draw from, but the talent for this film is definitely sub par. To be more blunt, this movie is unwatchable due to the lack of acting ability displayed by key roles. ",/review/rw4337025/?ref_=tt_urv
