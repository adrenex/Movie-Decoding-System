18 May 2021,fraser-simons,8," Gets better every episode
","I was on the fence for the first episode but it quickly won me over. The finale was alright. Interesting idea, not totally sure what that looks like for season 2, if it gets renewed. Whedon has been outed for pretty deplorable behaviour, who knows what that means.",/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2021,mysticnox,," I'm loving this show
","And the fact that it's headed up by Laura Donnelly just makes it all the better. She was awesome in Outlander, now she's awesome in this.",/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2021,UniqueParticle,9," Wasn't expecting to enjoy this so much
",Love the line about being civil and how wild the show starts out! Happy to see Joss Whedon directed/wrote this he's a legend in action plus being part of one of the best horror movies Cabin in the Woods. On and off have seen the previews for The Nevers for awhile I was iffy about it but it's awesomeness!,/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2021,fatfil-414-451797,9," Not for the narrow minded
","This series is hard to categorise. Kind of fantasy, science fiction, with some semi-lame X-men type super powers thrown in. It's set in Victorian times, add some graphic violence, a touch of profanity, and a huge dose of humour. Classic Joss Whedon. I am bewildered by the negative reviews, and definitely refute the accusations of poor acting. If you don't enjoy this, you should probably be watching The Fast and the Furious 12, or 13, whatever the latest action abomination Hollywood has vomited up.",/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2021,martink1767,9," Dont hate because Josh Whedon isn't in vogue.
","This is a superb supernatural drama. Well acted, great characters and superbly produced. Well worth a watch, so you can make up your own minds . I hoping its found its audience and gets a 2nd season. Love it.",/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2021,rblamanna,9," A very enjoyable Victorian sci-fi.
","I am astonished at the negative ""professional"" reviews for this series. It's well-produced, well-written, well-acted, and overall a very engaging series. Four episodes in and I find myself looking forward to the next installment. All of the criticisms I've seen are petty and/or absurd. ""The super powers are unrealistic."" That is a near verbatim line. ""All the bad guys are rich white men."" Another near verbatim criticism from the same review. Irony levels of an Onion article.",/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2021,scanlonjg,10," Don't pay any attention to the naysayers!!
","Ye gads, the critics really came down on this series because of Joss Whedon's involvement. But give it a chance. It's got an interesting storyline, steampunk influences, and a really great cast. Yes, the storyline is mostly about women, but they are all shapes, sizes, ages, etc. There are male and female heroes and villains. People with unnatural abilities, yes, that's been done before. And will be done again and again. There's nothing wrong with using that as a base. The show is great!",/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2021,sambriant1975,10," So original
","Have just binge watched the first six parts, I am totally hooked. This is a very original series that is really refreshing. It has great characters who you become really attached to. Some of the best television I've seen for a long time.",/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2021,kimmock-55731,9," Every Episode Needs to Be Watched Twice
","This isn't a lazy show- there is so much work put into the scenes, characters and acting and it shows in the finished product. So much better then reviews gave it. The episodes are so dense that to catch everything I've found myself rewatching every show. It's a wonderful, escapist, smart show. Can't wait to see where it takes me.",/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2021,briellejoymarshall,10," Amazing world and story telling.
","I am officially done reading the ""critic"" reviews.",/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2021,j_ryberg,10," Joss Whedon has written, produced and directed yet another fantastic series
","This is my kind of sci-fi fantasy; Sort of like James West and Artemis Gordon, except it's in 1899 London, and the heroes are women. Some reviewers don't like creativity, fantasy, and great production. This has all of those. I've always loved good science fiction, and at age 77, I still do. ""The Nevers"" has a mystery, and a couple of very smart, creative, ""touched"" women to solve it. I look forward to the next five episodes, and an S2.",/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2021,facesofine,9," Clever, Innovative, Engaging and Fun
","What a treat to see this fun, action fantasy drama featuring strong female characters!! It won't be the next GOT, but it has action, humor, heart and a crisp dialogue that keeps the momentum at an engaging speed. Some of the fight sequences are fresh takes on old maneuvers, beautifully choreographed!! Hope there'll be more seasons to flesh out the main characters and each of their stories.",/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2023,ukgreek,9," Cancelling was a huge mistake
","Maybe this show had the misfortune of happening during the pandemic. It was one of the most inventive shows in the past several years. Really crisp, sharp writing, excellent acting, and a highly entertaining story. They never took the easy way out. Laura Donnelly, Ann Skelly, Olivia Williams, James Norton, Amy Manson... all brilliant. Maybe the show was too female-centric and too progressive for these times. Too many strong women in one show? Not enough men doing manly things for the wider audience? It's really a shame, because this was a stunningly good show. That they pulled it after six episodes, not even airing the full 12, is just a crime and doesn't bode well for other shows that aren't afraid to be this compelling with so many powerful women at the centre.",/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2021,john-lancia-1,4," Why shouldn't I listen to the naysayers?
",Nothing says desperate studio like a bunch of 9 and 10 star reviews talking about not listening to the naysayers. All of them read like astro turf from studio secretaries and PA's using a list of talking points to write bs reviews for this mess of a show.,/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2021,cherold,9," Ignore the naysayers, this is great
","This series began with a real bang. After an intriguing, mysterious intro, it quickly moves into a slam-bang chase seen that's full of surprises, introduces you to old-timey superpower folks, and shows you the dark forces aligned against the primarily female touched sheltering downtown.",/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2023,ammonraa,10," Of course
","Finally an interesting and original concept that was well directed, shot and acted, and they in their infinite wisdom, cancel the show after one season.",/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2021,kriscahill,8," So unique and well written
",Like s Victorian X-Men meets Penny Dreadful.,/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2021,Wango-65681,4," Yawn
","Is there anything out there that hasn't been done to death already? They simply take existing gimmicks, through in some social justice fantasy on it and call it a wrap! In this case; the alphabet women vs. An assortment of evil white men. Add in a dose of Childhoods End against a backdrop of Penny Dreadful and, Presto! More JUNK!",/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2021,MrCods,9," Loved it
",Absolutely loved the pilot and if they keep it going like this then they will have a winner with this show. Cannot understand why some others didnt like it. I thought it was very well directed and acted. It is not a history lesson so leave that at the door with this serious action comedy.,/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2021,A_Different_Drummer,10," the king is back
","The man who gave us Buffy and Angel, who changed the way series' scripts were designed, and who single-handedly saved the Marvel empire from implosion, offers a series that is a delight to the eye, the ear and the intellect.",/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2021,diescobarmdq,8," One of the best shows I've watched in 2020
",Excellent show. After watching the first 6 episodes I can say it is more of a science fiction than fantasy show.,/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2021,lambiepie-2,4," What the heck Happened?
","The premiere of ""The Nevers"" started out like gangbusters-- and I was looking forward to where this was going. Then it starting going somewhere alright - somewhere that didn't make a darn bit of sense by the ""two part first season ending"".",/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2021,cmstultz,8," Intriguing new series
","Quirky and rife with mystery (based on the 1st episode), it drew me in. Fine performances by all the leads; lots of fun details and invention. I'll be watching more. And BTW, could someone please tell the reviewer who rated it ""1"" that this is a steampunk-infused fantasy/SF series? It's no more a rewrite of Victorian history than ""Lovecraft Country"" was a rewrite of American race relations in the 1950s, or ""Penny Dreadful"" an historical documentary about this same era.",/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2021,zendatrim,10," An exhausting journey of six episodes. AMAZING
","I have just binge watched this for 2 days. I would never have normally watched this type of series, but I quite like the idea of women with super powers so gave it ago. I didnt even know who the production guy was Joss Whedon. I rarely ever watch sci fi and didnt even now steampunk lol. Ah well at nearly 70 maybe its a time to have a change. I must admit i enjoyed Sweet Tooth, so why not this.",/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2021,AfricanBro,8," There's more to it
","I'm a sucker for anything involving magic during the Victorian times. 19 century Britain, supernatural powered women against powerful men in politics. Is it aliens, magic or is it God given? While watching each episode, I'm subconsciously convinced I know what's going on, then I watch the behind the scenes interviews after the credits and there is so much more to the story than you think.",/review/rw6935397/?ref_=tt_urv
