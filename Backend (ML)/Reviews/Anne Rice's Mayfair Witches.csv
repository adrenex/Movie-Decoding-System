19 March 2006,ccthemovieman-1,8," Call It What You Will, But It IS Entertaining!
","Many people see ""Jean-Claude Van Damme"" in the lead and think this another stupid, no-brainer action flick and guess what? It is! BUT, it is also a very entertaining film, kind of ripoff of the old ""Most Dangerous Game"" storyline....and, if you can suspend belief for 90-100 minutes, you'll be vastly entertained....and that's the name of the game, folks.",/review/rw3186512/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2018,ivo-cobra8,10," One of the greatest my personal favorite best action John Woo-Van-Damme action style movie!
","Hard Target (1993) is one of the greatest and the best action packed movie in a John Woo-Van-Damme Style! Of all Van Damme movies this one of his, is the best of Van Damme ever and I absolutely love it to death. Like the title says Don't hunt what you can't kill. It is my John Woo's number 1 personal favorite action flick of all time, that I love to death. It is also one one of my personal favorite action films of all time. ",/review/rw3186512/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2003,uds3,," Don't watch what you can't enjoy!
","Typical of the absurd criticism comes the way of most any Van Damme film is a reviewer I noticed below, who protractedly raves on paragraph after paragraph about nothing more incidental than the credibility-challenging motor cycle sequence. Jesus wept, what the hell does it matter whether such is possible or not? Is the freeway chase in THE MATRIX or TERMINATOR 3 likely? We go to the movies primarily to be entertained....to take a step into a world where reality takes a rain-check half the time! HARD TARGET is right up there with Van Damme's best work, and yes he DOES work. Personally I consider it his best film. Being Woo's first American outing, he creatively put a lot into this. Although scaled down, I found it equally as entertaining as FACE OFF, which like BROKEN ARROW, offered insane, impossible but FUN action sequences.",/review/rw3186512/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2002,martymaster,," Van Dammes best action movie ever.
","This is Van Dammes best action movie,and by action I mean a movie where there is shooting and acting,not just fighting. The movie is directed by John Woo which is one of the best action directors out there. The movie is entertaining from beginning to end.",/review/rw3186512/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2007,ma-cortes,7," First American film by John Woo with a tough and athletic Van Damme
","Jean Claude Van Damme is a seaman with no employment prowling around New Orleans,Louisian and stumbling onto mysterious and strange nasties. He spontaneously aiding a beautiful woman(Yancy Butler) when is attacked and taking on megalomaniac villains,(Lance Henriksen and Arnold Vosloo) who hunt human beings.He's only helped by a Bayou old man,(Wilford Brimley). This is a ¨Sui generis¨ version from ¨The most dangerous game¨,it's a vivid recounting of Richard Connell's famed novel ,adapted previously in the 1932 classic(Joel McCrea,Fay Wray) by Ernest B Schoedsack and by Robert Wise titled¨Game of death¨ and by Boulting titled ¨Run for the sun¨with Richard Widmark and Jane Greer.This theme has been filmed many times since and utilized as a plot for countless television and cinema argument.",/review/rw3186512/?ref_=tt_urv

","Very enjoyable, amazing stunts, the hero is badass, the villains are awesome...
It's one of my favorite movies from my childhood!",/review/rw3186512/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2018,phanthinga,9," Van Damme is a Hard Target
","How often do you see Van Damme rocking a ridiculous mullet and sucker punch a rattlesnake then bites off it tail ?Chances are small cause he only does all that in Hard Target his best movie in my opinion and directed by John-woo a master of action cinema who bring his own style of action""gun-fu"" to Hollywood for the first time ever.This movie is really awesome with all the bullet flying,fire blazing and Van Damme in his prime giving all his strengh to flip over anything that possible while also dual-wielding guns out of a horde of bad guys hunting homeless people for sport lead by Lance Henriksen.The final shoot-out at the abandoned werehouse is my favorite for how over the top it is with the violence and gun-fight",/review/rw3186512/?ref_=tt_urv

",This is probably the only movie of Van Damme where I dont find his acting ridiculous:) Classic,/review/rw3186512/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2018,bboygringo,10," Critics must be high.
","This has got to be the best van damme movie out of all of them, such a great directing, filming, good plot, awesome action, a badass van damme out of all his other films, people criticising this must be unhappy with life because there's no way this could be a low rated movie, imbd should have rated this at least 7.0",/review/rw3186512/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 1999,crewcut6,," Guns, blood, Woo, Van Damme, oh my!!
","This is basically raw John Woo: bullets flying, fire blazing, good guys, bad guys, this movie has the whole ball of wax! In Woo's 1st American flick, Jean Claude Van Damme high-kicks and shoots as many baddies as he can trying to find the killers of the father of Yancer Butler's character right in the heart of the deep South.

8 February 2019,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,10," Don't hunt what you can't kill - Hard Target is my number 1 favorite action film of all time
","Jean-Claude Van Damme is ""Hard Target"" one of my personal number 1 action favorite films of all time. Hard Target, RoboCop (1987), Aliens (1986), Predator 1 and 2, ra,mbo: First Blood Part II, Rambo III, Die hard, Die Hard: With a Vengeance, Hard Boiled are equally favorite action films of mine. This is John Woo's best film in my opinion he made it in the USA. My favorite number 1 Jean-Claude Van Damme film his best one. I love the action scenes, the gory kills, Van Damme with two guns love his line: Give it a rest, pal and bang bang he shoots the bad guy in the motorcycle suite. ""Hunting season... is over"" and he launches grenade in to the bad guy. John Woo directed this film and he directed great.",/review/rw3186512/?ref_=tt_urv

19 April 2000,JohnnyPHreak,8," John Woo and Van Damme make a pretty good team
","Right here and now I'll say this is Van Damme best movie and he picked the right director for it. It an action adventure about a team of killers are who paid to hunt by rich people. The movie is not action filled as the video box may tell you. But it does have enough to make your mouth water. If you know John Woo than you know that his films spread out the action and put space of acting between them. The acting is not top notch but it is believable. But what makes this movie is the action sequences. They have remnants of Woo's other movies like Broken Arrow, Hard Boiled, The Killer and the final scene looks like it was plucked straight out of Face/Off. You have to see it to believe it. Van Damme does his normal tough guy not talking much thing but it is great to see him with two pistols in his hands. It's a 7 for total movie but gets a 10 for action. Action movie junkies will love Hard Target. John Woo and Van Damme makes for great action.",/review/rw3186512/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2016,Leofwine_draca,10," A masterpiece of heavily stylised action in John Wood's much-imitated slow-mo style
","To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this thriller, especially after I'd read so much negative press about it over the Internet. But, despite it being much maligned, I thought this was a great action film. One of the best I've seen, in fact, ranking right up there with the DIE HARD and UNDER SIEGE series. I do agree that the story is basically just an excuse to string together the numerous set pieces and ripping off THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME. But thankfully, most of the screen time is given to these set pieces, so there's nothing really to complain about that much. Much of the acting is also pretty bad, but done in a strange tongue in cheek way, so I was enjoying this and laughing along at the things happening.",/review/rw3186512/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2001,SPaS,," Beats the s**t out of M:I-2!
","Now I'm a fan of all Woo films; even the worst of his works, such as ""Broken Arrow"", are at least 'standard fare' in Hollywood-terms; this, however, does not apply to the few sad TV-attempts he made (The ""Once a thief""-cable flick is just dreadful...). ""Face/Off"" and even the 'funny' ""M:I-2"" are both action-packed showdowns which demonstrate well what Woo can do. But his first Hollywood-attempt still remains the best of them- at least, to date! ""Hard target"" was shoot with very little time and then re-edited 7 times (count'em- seven!) to finally pass the censorship (yes, I'd call it that!) and STILL, after assumably at least half (?) the flavour taken out, it's still one tough cookie! Maybe frustrated at the censorship, Woo has later on stayed on the safe R-rated waters in Hollywood, not even trying to top himself (And again, STILL remaining the best bet when it comes to directing some serious action!)",/review/rw3186512/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2000,Sharkey360,10," The best Van Damme film...thanks to John Woo!
","Jean Claude Van Damme has many, many and many action films all in all...but none of them comes close to the art, fast-pace, intensity and entertainment of Hard Target. And the factor behind these? John Woo! John Woo has proven himself the answer on providing greatness to Van Damme, and it's obvious that Van Damme's films that followed, simply lacked goodness.",/review/rw3186512/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2009,Ziya90,10," Face/Off looks like a soap opera in comparison with this
","Hard Target is a perfect action film. As the director himself said in an interview, this movie is like a modern Western. Like John Carpenter, John Woo is also a Western movie fan. In his first debut in Hollywood, I disagree with the claim that he disappoints. He delivers again like his most entertaining Hollywood film Broken Arrow. There are two parts in this movie which are my favorite. The sequence takes place in a deserted street in the middle of the movie and the sequence which takes place in another deserted area as final showdown. The action scenes in this movie are amazing! There is a great bike chase scene in the middle, he shot a similar scene in Paycheck, but it was nothing. In another scene, Van Damme and Pik Van Cleef are in a Mexican standoff which is even better than Face/Off. This is a movie which is imitated several times by his own director! You might interpret this as he likes that or as he imitated Hard Target, because it was his peak. Arnold Vosloo and Lance Henriksen are terrific villains and especially Vosloo as the main henchman becomes one of the most memorable bad guys in movie history. Probably his best character so far! Lance Henriksen is another story. He defines the term villain. Since that year, I have not forgotten the still he puts his pump-riffle on his arm and takes aim or the still that Van Damme breathes the dusty pump-riffle. Van Damme with long hair is also cool. John Woo uses slow motion, even if too much sometimes and he zooms the arrows which the key object of the movie. A triumph! And may be Uncle Douvee character makes the movie cliché, a back up for the main action character and his romance with the lady is another cliché, but just ignore it. By the way, Yancy Buther is so cute in this film and she was my love in this film when I was a kid. Van Damme and John Woo don't make such movies anymore. Perfect story, perfect villains, perfect action, perfect editing, perfect story line, my personal favorite Van Damme film ever.",/review/rw3186512/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2000,richalexh,10," Up there with Die Hard a true action classic
","John Woo's first u.s film is a hugely underrated hugely enjoyable action thriller beautiflly shot and bursting with style this is certainly Van Damme's best film and in my books is at the top of the action genre. It's a sort of updating of 1930's thriller The Most Dangerous Game. It centres around a women searching for  her father in New Orleans who enlists the help of tough cajun chance boudreux i don't wanna say any more about the plot cos i don't wanna give to much away.this is the part of Van Damme's career when his acting wasn't too bad, the rest of the cast are mostly a solid bunch of unknowns who prove they've got what it takes to make this a tight well made thriller. Lance Henriksen is great as Fouchon and Arnold Vosloo equally as good as accomplice Van cleef. Even though in my opinion this is Woo's best u.s film it took him 2 more attempts to breakthrough into the Hollywood mainstream in which he finally struck gold with Face/Off. Hard Target comes out a dark action thriller packed with a superb blend of martial arts shootouts and explosions. I recommend this to any 1 weather your an action junkie, die hard van damme fan or just a general film buff. Up there with Die Hard this is a true action classic",/review/rw3186512/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 1999,keefy,10," A very tight, well made film.
","Many people say that this film could be marked down as a cobweb in John Woo's closet. It is far from this, but only if you see the full uncencored version, which is available in the UK for people who own PAL video machines. I think that this is John Woo's best American made work. Better than Face / Off, which was well filmed but lacked the Woo stylised violence to keep your interest up. But Hard Target has plenty. Certain people believe that the end gunfight in the Mardi Gras graveyard is among Woo's best visually. The flurry of quick bloody violence is overwhelmingly adrenaline pumping, Van Damme pumps the bad guys with more bullets in 15 minutes than Desperado did in two hours! The American Version is quite mediocre compared to the UK version, the US version contains less violence and if you look in the goofs section most of the stuff ups are due to the violence being edited out. I do know where you can get your hands on a rough cut of the 116 minute version but it is a bit of a waste of time, due to the fact that there is no colour (except a greeny tone) and most of the 20 minutes extra are just talking.",/review/rw3186512/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2021,lukem-52760,10," Probably my favourite Action Movie from the Awesome 90's!!!! An Action CLASSIC
","Van Damme was an action legend during the late 80's to early 90's & i grew up watching him like i did Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Snipes & Seagal, from young & loved the Action genre so much & John Woo's HARD TARGET was definitely one of my favourites & it's definitely one of Van Damme's best movies!!!!",/review/rw3186512/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2012,DaRick89,6," Competent action thriller
","As with many action movies, Hard Target's strengths and weaknesses are fairly simple to analyse. It's a competent action thriller, notable for some stylish action scenes that have John Woo's touch; one particularly memorable example is when Chance Boudreaux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) quite literally blasts a bikie thug out a window with a shotgun and a petrol can! These moments pretty much make the film worth seeing by themselves, despite the usual weaknesses in the plotting and JCVD's ever wooden countenance. As JCVD himself noted however, viewers paid the money to see him waste bad guys and he does plenty of this - sometimes in more inventive ways than expected (using snake traps). It very much makes the film worth seeing for action buffs, even though I'm reluctant to give a really high rating based on this alone.",/review/rw3186512/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2006,buzznzipp1995,10," Before the storm, it still wasn't calm...
","I believe at this point in time that John Woo, should either change his Asian-dance number in every movie he makes and every single fight sequence!! Today! Take on a new and different approach. If you don't know what that means, John studied Dance, the flowing Asian style dancing and has used it, (I guess like football players study Ballet) using it in the shoot-outs and fighting scenes to add an element of grace and flowing movement to the stories's scene.

13 June 1999,Gustav-8,10," john woo RULES
","This is no doubt one of Hollywood's best action movies, and it's all thanks to John Woo. This Hongkong director is the master of visual action scenes. But not only Mr. Woo did a good job, but Lance Henriksen, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Arnold Vosloo also perform incredibly. This is one of my all-time favorites. If you liked this one, you should see Woo's old Hongkong movies. You won't know what'll hit you. And for you Evil Dead fans: look how Van Damme uses that pistol in the final action scene.",/review/rw3186512/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 1999,DaWHo,," ...miles better than most Hollywood action fare.
","Action master John Woo's first (and best) American movie is somewhat of a disappointment to his Hong Kong movie fans--see ""Hard Boiled"" and ""The Killer"" for comparison--but still miles better than most Hollywood action fare.  A good introduction to Woo's directing style with plenty of show-stopping action sequences, incredible stunt work and a solid performance by Van Damme.  Despite a very impressive ending set piece and lots of awesome slow motion gun play, the movie (as released) seems to be missing something.  Seek out the unrated, uncut version if at all possible--you won't regret it!",/review/rw3186512/?ref_=tt_urv
