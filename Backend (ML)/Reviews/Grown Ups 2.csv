21 March 2005,BrandtSponseller,10," Great action, great suspense, great cultural satire, and a great mind-bender
","Set during an unspecified future era, Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a construction worker who longs for a trip to Mars. His wife, Lori (Sharon Stone) isn't so keen on it--she'd prefer a trip to Saturn, or a space cruise. Riding on the subway one day, Quaid notices a television advertisement for a company named Rekall, which specializes in memory implants of vacations. Quaid checks into it as an alternate means of having a ""Mars vacation"". While at Rekall, he chooses an alternate personality upgrade of a secret agent. However, while undergoing the procedure, something goes wrong. He learns that his Quaid identity was a memory implant and he really _is_ a secret agent. Now that he has his real memory back, he's on the run and he escapes to Mars. But why is everyone after him? ",/review/rw0288902/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2020,Fella_shibby,8," A true science fiction action extravaganza.
","I first saw this in 1990 on a vhs i used to own.
Revisited it recently.
The three boobs n the comedic bulging eyes stayed with me from a tender young age.
The film has lots of action, some violent scenes, good one liners n Arnie's fine acting at display.
Surprisingly, this time he doesn't get to go shirtless or in a vest.
The mutants mayb disturbing for some viewers.
This was one of the earliest one to deal with a secret agent losing memory and all. Way before Bourne Identity and Jackie Chan's Who am I.",/review/rw0288902/?ref_=tt_urv

","The worker Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) dreams on Mars for many consecutive nights. He invites his wife Lori (Sharon Stone) to spend vacation on Mars, but she does not agree, since the planet ruled by the tyrant Vilos Cohaagen (Ronny Cox), who sells oxygen for the population, is facing resistance movement and terrorist acts leaded by the mutant Kuato. Douglas decides to go to the Rekall Company to implant virtual vacation memories of Mars for his own satisfaction, using a special program with the identity of a secret agent. While in the process, something goes wrong and Douglas becomes aggressive, and the process is interrupted. While returning home, the life of Douglas turns upside down, and he travels to the red planet trying to disclose who he is.",/review/rw0288902/?ref_=tt_urv

","In 2020, Douglas feels he needs a break from the day to day life and goes to Total Recall  where memories are planted in your head to make you think you are someone else for a while  a holiday in your head if you will.  However before he can be injected he begins to have flashbacks and suddenly finds that people are trying to kill him and that somehow he must get to Mars to uncover the reasons.  However what is truth and what is fake and is the whole thing really happening or not?",/review/rw0288902/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2006,Quinoa1984,8," one of the most enjoyable of the Arnold action vehicles
","Total Recall has little, if any,by way of passing itself as being 'art'. It is, but more in the sense of it being pop-art, of the director Paul Verhoven paying tribute in visuals to the story by Phillip K. Dick. And it's also one of the more exciting and quotable of those shameless examples of how to do an action film. In this case, however, because it is a P.K. Dick-based story there are some good social bits made in the process. If it isn't as astute or consistent as Blade Runner or Minority Report, it's probably more due to it having to be a vehicle for Arnold Schwarzenegger than it being a full-on thought-provoking work of science fiction on film. But this does rank up high with the other works of the star, as he is in a complex situation in the film- his mind is scrambled, at first, and everything he thought was right as dickens is not. So he's told by 'himself' on a screen he happened to save for himself that he has to get to mars to find out the truth.",/review/rw0288902/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2021,Sleepin_Dragon,10," Still an incredible film.

30 May 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8," See you at the party.
","'Total Recall (1990)' is both an interesting, layered, concept-driven science-fiction film and a squishy, one-liner-filled, Arnold Schwarzenegger action romp, essentially, in equal measure. It's concerned just as much with its special effects and filled-to-the-brim squibs as it is with its twisty narrative and heady ideas. This contrast is, in practice, cohesion. It's what sets the piece apart from almost all others in its genre. It's enjoyable on all levels. It provides breathless, balls-to-the-wall action and an intriguing, ultimately fulfilling narrative filled with well-rounded characters and genuinely clever concepts. The world is incredibly creative and the tone is spot on, in typical Verhoeven fashion. The characters are also great, though, and the way they interact with the central conceit is brilliant. I won't spoil the main twist of the piece but it really is fantastic, something that you'll still be pondering - as a concept - long after the credits have rolled. On the whole, this is a really great film. It's tangible, exciting, inventive and, generally, just entertaining. 8/10",/review/rw0288902/?ref_=tt_urv

21 June 2002,Agent10,7," Classic Verhoeven
","One of the best mind trips ever, I could only wish this movies was made ten years later. Even for 1990, this film had some of the most imaginative make-up I've ever seen in a movie. While it had Paul Verhoeven's classic shallowness, the film really touched new ground not only with science fiction but also with special effects. Talk a good few years for a director, he not only changed sci-fi with Robocop, he did it again with Total Recall. Verhoeven will never, ever win an Oscar for best director, but his movies will at least be entertaining in most respects.",/review/rw0288902/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2016,Leofwine_draca,10," Amazing sci-fi action adventure just keeps on giving
","Much like his other hit movies ROBOCOP and STARSHIP TROOPERS, Dutch director Paul Verhoeven here delivers another exciting, entertaining and wholly fun slice of science fiction, packed to the brim with violence and gore. The premise on which the film is based is taken from a Philip K. Dick short story, We Can Remember It For You Wholesale, and provides an engrossing look at the question of ""what is reality?"". Throughout the film, we are never sure if the events taking place are real, or a simple dream, and the ambiguity of the situation makes it all the more interesting.",/review/rw0288902/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2017,stormhawk2021,10," Awesome P.K. Dick adaptation
","Loosely inspired by one of Philip K. Dick's stories, this is a superb sci-fi action thriller set in a dystopic 2084 about a construction worker named Quaid who decides to go on a 'vacation' by having memories of a secret agent fantasy implanted into his brain, only for things to go horribly awry...or maybe not. Despite a few silly and cheesy moments, this is a wonderful, if violent action thriller that is both entertaining, and rather thought provoking. It really toys with that oft-used concept of blurring the line between what's real and what isn't, and this is one of the few films that actually does it quite well, with enough evidence to support multiple theories, with the true ending of the film dependent upon each viewer's own opinion. Like many of Verhoeven's American films, it's got a lot of violence, but provides a lot of thought provoking ideas and material, often satirical, as well. It's all presented with some groundbreaking special effects (almost all of them done practically or in camera as opposed to CGI), a terrific score by Jerry Goldsmith, and some decent, if sometimes silly, but still fun performances. And let's not forget about the most memorable thing this film has to offer: a three-breasted mutant prostitute! Definitely give this one a watch. It's not flawless, but it is remarkably strong, and easily one of both Verhoeven and Schwarzenegger's best films.",/review/rw0288902/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2016,Tweekums,8," Arnie has an adventure on Mars
","In the year 2084 protagonist Douglas Quaid is apparently an ordinary construction worker but he has recurring dreams about events on Mars involving a woman who is not his wife. He has no idea why he has the dreams; he has never stepped foot on Mars and has not met the woman or so he thinks. One day he decides to visit 'Rekall'; a company that implants the memories of a perfect holiday. Naturally he selects a holiday on Mars during which he will have a fantasy adventure as a secret agent. As the procedure starts something goes wrong and he starts ranting about having really been to Mars and how his life is in danger. He flees and is chased by people determined to kill him. He gets home and learns that his wife isn't the person he thought she was apparently his whole life up to this point is a false memory. Managing to evade his captors he heads to Mars to discover the truth. Here he meets the woman from his dreams, gets involved in a rebellion against the tyrannical authorities and learns of a plot to hide the discovery of alien technology but is it real or has something gone horribly wrong at Rekall?",/review/rw0288902/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2019,bowmanblue,10," Premium Arnie
","Ignore 'Terminator: Genysis' and those recent 'straight-to-DVD' films that Arnold Schwarzenegger is - sadly - repeatedly churning out. Once upon a time (or at least in 1990, anyway), he ruled the Box Office with impunity. His 'highpoint' probably came a year later with 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day,' but - in my opinion - 'Total Recall' comes a close second.",/review/rw0288902/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2020,briancham1994,7," Mind-bending and funny
","This film is quite aware that it's trying to be a serious mind-bender while also being a cheesy Schwarzenegger action film and combines the two styles deftly. Paul Verhoeven is probably the best director for this project, as he had proven himself with science fiction action with comedic elements. It really pays off. There are lots of twists and turns here, as well as a constant sense of paranoia.",/review/rw0288902/?ref_=tt_urv

","Total recall is a typical sci-fi movie packed with action and of course Arnie.

9 December 1998,SuperVHS,," Action sci-fi at it's best..
","Total Recall is without doubt Arnold Schwarzenegger's best movie since The Terminator. Arnold fits perfectly in the role of Doug Quaid (definitely his best acting in a movie to date) the confused construction worker and Ronny Cox provides his usual evil plotting arch bad-guy. The impressive visual effects are worth the movie's $100million price tag, and Paul Verhoeven proved that, as with Robocop and Starship Troopers, sci-fi is where he does his best work.",/review/rw0288902/?ref_=tt_urv
