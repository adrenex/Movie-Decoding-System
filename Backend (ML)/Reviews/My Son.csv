","I love you, you can not spend time with me, but it is taboo to look down on my dreams. You don't look at yourself, indulge in fame, forget the original intention, you have no reason to lose temper with me.
I love you when you talk about your dreams, and I do n't love you. I am busy, and I have my dream to work hard.
I love you, so let me go.
Sebastian let her go after her dream because he loved Mia. Because only he knew where her brightest eyes, the most gorgeous smile, and the most energetic look of the whole person came from.
Because I love you, I am not qualified to imprison you by my side. I can never tolerate you doing anything wronged for me.
""About us, just wait for the answer."" Sebastian said as he sat on the bench on the top of the mountain, Mia nodded in conscience.
Even the farewell is full of tacit understanding, and at a glance everything is understood. There is no bitterness and hatred, no complaint.
These are two independent personalities who hold the right to choose. In the bright future, there will be no more lovers like you who appreciate me, but I have a complete dream and myself.
After maturity, Mia became a big star, with a mansion, children, gentleman husband. Sebastian opened a jazz club, the venue was full, the name she gave was the same. Love is the most regrettable, the most indecent, the most shining, the most incomprehensible, the sweetest, and the most grievous, making life in your hands trivial.
Reluctant to say something later, miss is to miss.
We have a calmer and more mature life at the cost of losing each other. But if we did not choose to say goodbye, we will not arrive safely on this shore now.
Dreams seem to be the killer of love, but without dreams, she will not be attracted by the piano sound until the downfall of genius falls into her arms.
It is a dream to make the two lives full of life and make all the lost things meaningful.",/review/rw6886712/?ref_=tt_urv

4 April 2020,IreneWatsonC,8," Loving you is like loving part of my life
","This movie is infinitely close to when we were young: arrogant, romantic, dreamy, longing for love, but lack of money. Then when we have tasted the hardships and pains of society and finally achieved something, is the person around you still the one you love the most? Only when you have thoroughly pained and loved, can you understand how difficult it is to be innocent love. Only when you let go can you support your dream and fulfill your pursuit. In the end, Mia's fantasy surprised all the audience. This is the fantasy of all sweet love, and it is the most exciting meaning of this movie. I dare say that if there is no final fantasy, or the hero and heroine are together again, this movie will eventually become a second-rate love song and dance drama. Only if you can't get it, can you fully understand the bitterness and sweetness of youth. After all, the most beautiful love is just a flash in the pan. I love you, but I can only wish you happiness. This is the supreme love. This love becomes a part of life and a belief. LA LA LAND, loving you is like loving part of my life.",/review/rw6886712/?ref_=tt_urv

",Not a lot to say but what a joy to watch and listen to. The vivid colors and brilliant choreography just had me in a trance.

27 January 2017,marcosaguado,9," For The Love Of Movies
","Damien Chazelle is a young director who loves and knows movies, from Federico Fellini to Jacques Demy. Hallellujah! Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone go back to inspire us forward. What's more surprising than anything else is the feel of amateurishness in the dancing in the singing. So refreshing not to have a sleek but empty experience. Damian Chazelle' Whiplash was a brilliant preview of forthcoming attractions. I would love to see a thriller directed by Chazelle, something like Shadow Of A Doubt or even a glossy damsel in distress story like Midnight Lace. That's what happens when we discover a new and startling talent. You want to see him do everything. I have a feeling this young artist will.",/review/rw6886712/?ref_=tt_urv

","A little film. Not sure whether you might have heard of it yet?

10 August 2019,wgerhardt,10," A true ode to the Golden Era of Hollywood
","The vibrant colors and use of musical scores to set the mood for scenes transported myself back in time. This movie feels not only like a beautifully nostalgic nod to Hollywood of yesteryear, but also that of a timeless love story. Gosling and Stone have a charm to their chemistry on screen during the musical and dance numbers. All these aspects lead to a raw portrayal of love that many experience in life, with still providing a sense of hope and wonder to the viewers. I was entranced from the opening scene until the final note played by Goslings piano. I absolutely recommend this film to any and everyone!",/review/rw6886712/?ref_=tt_urv

",What is everyone in this film singing and dancing about? Our story starts off in a traffic jam on a freeway and suddenly everyone does a song and dance number that sets the tone that this film is a colorful original musical about ambitious young people who pursue their dreams in LA.

7 January 2017,Hitchcoc,9," A Really Pleasant Experience
","It's so nice that someone was willing to produce an original musical that wasn't animated. Emma Stone and Ryan Goslin light up the screen. The songs are very well written and fit well within the parameters of the romance that develops. I think the people that are so angry about the hype this film has gotten forget that the musicals it mimics had pretty basic plots. Oh, so it's the worst film of the year! Really? This is a story about dreams and hopes and trying to achieve them in an environment where the chances are really slim. The production numbers are sappy to be sure, but that's what this kind of offering puts to us. It tells us that we can just have fun and root for the characters.",/review/rw6886712/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2020,Dello_,10," Heart warming, highly poetic and gorgeous
","""La La Land"" is a fantastic movie, better than what I could have expected before watching and it has rapidly became one of my favourite movie ever. I loved Whiplash (Damien Chazelle's previous work) but this one is something special. ""La La Land"" is about a couple and their love story, which I have to admit isn't something too particular or too original, even if I liked a lot the ending because it was something different but nothing that was never seen. The real merit of this movie is the way in which everything is portrayed, starting from the magnificent direction by Chazelle to the score by Hurwitz, including the great cinematography and all the cast. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were both exceptional (in particular in the last 20 seconds) considering they also had to dance and sing, in which they were pretty amazing. Generally I don't like musicals but ""La La Land"" is different because first of all I found more contextualised the dancing and singing scenes than a usual musical, secondly they are gorgeous. And all the movie in particular is highly poetic because of its bright colours that warms the heart, of the music which is fantastic and so thoughtless that brings you away from your dimension to make you live two hours in this pocket universe in which you feel light and without any mass. And you look around to the bright colours and you listen to the music played and you elevate yourself like the protagonists in a memorable scene. I know that it seems like a very good trip but I wasn't high, it was just the movie that provoked me all these feelings and emotions. For this reason I loved every single moment of it and it's one of my favourite movies ever. So if you haven't watched ""La La Land"" yet, be sure to check it out. It's unlikely that everyone loves it as much as I do, but the poetic aspect of it really touched some cords in my heart, maybe will do this even for you. And if not it is however visually stunning, sweet to hear and it has an enjoyable story, so it is worth watching anyway.",/review/rw6886712/?ref_=tt_urv

",Did someone say last year's Oscars were too white ? So let's award most of this year's Oscars to something that looks like an explosion in a paint factory where every primary colour is splashed across the screen . LA LA LAND was being touted as the film to beat even before most of the other contenders were announced and its domination at the Golden Globes confirmed everything .

7 May 2021,SimonJack,5," This ""hardly musical"" can't compare with the great song and dance films of the past
","After watching this movie in early 2021 on DVD, I was puzzled by its very high IMDb rating. With more than half a million ratings, ""La La Land"" had an average of 8.0. I am a long-time fan of musicals of all varieties, so the high rating of this film seems strange. How could so many people think this film is equal to the best musicals of all time? Do they really think it is better than all but a few musicals? Musicals with a dozen or more songs? With hit tunes? With great compositions by famous composers? With singing by the best and most popular singers? With dance numbers and choreography by the greatest hoofers of all time?",/review/rw6886712/?ref_=tt_urv
