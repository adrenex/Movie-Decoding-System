4 April 2014,TxMike,," Not a 'pretty' movie, gets down and gritty in the Rust Belt.
","The ""rust belt"" - the informal description for a postindustrial steel region referring to economic decline, population loss and urban decay due to the shrinking of its once powerful industrial sector. Previously it was known as the industrial heartland of America and includes parts of states such as New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and New Jersey. Those are some of the areas depicted in this movie.",/review/rw3087361/?ref_=tt_urv

","All star cast, probably one of the best that have come together in a film. Ever. Every one at the top of their game. Score fit perfectly. It's not a Hollywood action, Not over the top and not boring either. It doesn't fixate too much on anything in particular and just tells it's story coherently. You can't get too much better than that. A script with touch of sincerity, with a director whom knew exactly where to take it, and actors and actresses able to sink into the roles and bring it to life. It's not the most amazing movie I've ever seen but it's a masterpiece of sorts, for sure.",/review/rw3087361/?ref_=tt_urv

21 November 2013,trublu215,9," In the vein of The Deer Hunter, Out of the Furnace captures the hopelessness of a nation
","Scott Cooper wowed us with Crazy Heart, his directorial debut that nabbed Jeff Bridges his long awaited Best Actor Oscar in 2009. Cooper has waited 4 years to bring us something that is very much so in the vein of his last film. Out of the Furnace tells the bleak story of Russell Baze and his determination to discover the truth about his little brother, Rodney, after he goes missing without a trace. The strength of this film relies on the performances, hands down. There is no real plot twist, there is no memorable camera work, this is a film that is built upon the strengths of its lead actors, especially Christian Bale and Woody Harrelson. This is a throwback to 1970 style cinema where story and acting trump anything technically. The story is generic but it never feels quite as stale when you're watching it because no matter how many times we've seen this story, we get lost in Christian Bale's performance. He is a man of many facial expressions and very few words and that really plays to his benefit in this film. It shows that, while Bale can be as goofy as Dickie Ecklund in The Fighter, he can also be as dark and ominous as Russell Baze. We really see that Christian Bale is becoming one of the best actors of this generation and with Out of the Furnace, he solidifies that. While Bale delivers a dark and gritty portrayal of a man with nothing to lose, it is Woody Harrelson that plays Curtis DeGroat, a sick, backwoods, meth- dealing, brute and Harrelson plays him perfectly. Without giving any spoilers away, there are a couple scenes (one of which involves a prostitute) that are so unflinchingly brutal that features DeGroat at his most nefarious. These are the roles that Harrelson relishes in, and this film goes to show that nobody can play a villain quite like Harrelson. He's the guy you love to hate and in Out of the Furnace, I have to say he plays DeGroat with a pitch-perfect tone that it makes you wonder where the line is drawn in his mind. You lose yourself in the scenes with Harrelson because he is just that good at playing a sadistic psychopath with murderous tendencies. The rest of the cast, including Casey Affleck, are outstanding. However, this film showcases Bale and Harrelson as definite Oscar hopefuls and it uses that to its advantage. While we see enough of Affleck, Saldana and Whitaker, the film belongs to Bale and Harrelson. This is a bleak and brutal film with fantastic performances across the board. It is far from the feel good movie of the year, quite the opposite, it is probably the most depressing next to Prisoners, but just because you won't leave the theater with a grin doesn't mean you should skip this.",/review/rw3087361/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2013,FilmMuscle,7," A Promising Start That Leads to Run-Of-The-Mill Fare
","An all-star cast, comprising Christian Bale, Casey Affleck, Woody Harrelson, Forest Whitaker, Willem Dafoe, and Zoe Saldana (wow!), is cast into the cavernous of troubles. Two brothers- one a former solider who served in Iraq (Rodney, played by Casey Affleck) and the other an impoverished factory worker (Russell, played by Christian Bale) - embark on vastly disparate paths. Their relationship has lost its bygone flare, considering Rodney's extensively damaged psyche and his desire to stray away from standard work, instead choosing to make money off of brutal street fighting and gambling. When he asininely involves himself with ruthless wagering criminals (led by Woody Harrelson), all circumstances invert and numerous lives are consequently affected. ",/review/rw3087361/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2013,A_Different_Drummer,8," not a movie it's an acting clinic
","Look at the producer credits and you will see some of the biggest names in the biz. Which is of course a pre-requisite to get some of the biggest names in front of the camera too. Bale, as much a chameleon as an actor. Harrelson who does bad guys and sociopaths so well he should trademark it. Shepard? There was a time you could build an entire movie around this guy, he was testosterone on wheels. Ditto for Whitaker and Dafoe, if you print off their IMDb credits, have an extra laser cartridge handy, because you will run out. Affleck is young but he's a comer. He has already done some extraordinary work especially in KILLER INSIDE ME. He is not there for the second half of the film (spoiler) but his portrayal is haunting. So, that said, is this film a keeper? It's slow. Parts of it are like watching paint dry. It is possible to be hypnotically interesting (because of the acting) and yet plodding (because of the script and the direction). I loved it, but I am a film guy. As a revenge flick, it has issues. TAKEN it ain't. So bottom line it depends on what your expectations are...",/review/rw3087361/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I saw the cast list, I knew there would be some wonderful performances, but I was surprised at how they uniformly surpassed my expectations.

6 December 2013,twcrossman,10," Still an accurate portrait of many towns in America today
","Weeks before I took the time to see Out of the Furnace on its opening day today, I saw an interview with the cast where star Christian Bale made a comment about how the script and the character really stuck with him before he'd ever agreed to take the role. While I normally hate to see a film based on something ANY of the actors involved have said (because really, who WOULDN'T give their film a nice push to the press?), I had a gut feeling I'd want to see this one. It's a good thing I tend to go with my gut, because if you watch for two hours with an open mind, Out of the Furnace is certainly filled with dilemmas people across America STILL face on a daily basis -- and that alone is why it will hit too close to home. It is why some people will say it is ""too"" gritty, ""too"" depressing, ""too"" much of something. ",/review/rw3087361/?ref_=tt_urv

28 July 2016,Leofwine_draca,6," All-too-familiar mood piece
","OUT OF THE FURNACE is a simmering story of revenge, betrayal, and murder, brought to life via a couple of volatile performances from the leading actors. Altogether it's rather familiar story and one which has been done time and time again in the cinemas, but then this film isn't really about the story at all but rather the mood, the ambiance of the thing. The director's goal is to realise some of the simmering tension of the likes of BADLANDS, charting a ruthless small town America where death and destruction are just around the corner and people are happy to turn a blind eye to such events in their midst.",/review/rw3087361/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2019,tiffmasters,10," Better Every time
","With a cast like this, what could go wrong? Answer, nothing. The melodramatic tale of two brothers caught on the difficult side of life shows eloquently and brutally, shows us how easy it is to lose everything, good, bad, or otherwise intended actions having been made. Christian Bale is a hard working man, who adores his girlfriend, brother and the rest of his downtrodden family. Casey Affleck, with no less amount of love or devotion, returned from the military a little more shattered than expected. While the brothers' patriarch is bed ridden and failing in health, one accident seemingly destroys all of the good in a man. Difficult, under appreciated work; a violent, unpredictable brother; multiple losses one can hardly handle when life is good, Bales story reminds us of how quickly we can lose it all, and the suffering we can be set up for. While most of his life's trials are beyond his control, the action which takes him fully under, is made by choice, to the viewers, but out of necessity to the man. The script is well written, the characters beyond well acted, the subplots epic, and the always accompanied ugly-crying, takes viewers into an abyss we may never know otherwise. I recommend this movie to everyone. You can either relate and realize suffering is conquerable; or you will see how much worse it could be.",/review/rw3087361/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2022,reddiemurf81,7," I got a problem with everybody.
","Harlan Degroat (Harrelson) is mean spirited sociopath. The opening scene shows him terrorizing the woman with him, beating a guy senseless, and challenging any onlooker to take him on. On top of his lunacy, he's also addicted to meth, and heads up his own illegal fighting matches near the mountain community where he lives. No one dares to speak a word against him, and the law won't go near him. He's basically a backwater kingpin, you could say.",/review/rw3087361/?ref_=tt_urv

Out of the Furnace is incredibly well filmed and acted I don't know why I didn't watch sooner cause it's very worth it! All the deals, money stuff, drugs, fights and other scenes are astounding!

14 December 2013,matthewssilverhammer,4," An authentic and good-looking film that rings completely untrue in its characterizations and script
","It's unfair to label ""Out of the Furnace"" a bad film. It's well shot. The setting is effectively imposing and formidable. The performances are nuanced and engaging. The sense of time is easily understood. Unfortunately, the positives end there. While it's an authentic and good-looking film, the lazy, heavy-handed script offers very little originality and rings mostly untrue. ""Furnace"" could be accurately described as ""gritty"", a genuine look at blue-collar, lower-middle class people. It's a fairly simple ""good guys vs. bad guys"" revenge film that avoids melodrama by instead opting to be boring. As it slowly plods along, it becomes increasingly clear that it has no interest in allowing us to infer anything about the subtler points of the story. The emotions it forces on us are manipulative and unnatural, and the dialogue is so heavy-handed and full of clichés I felt I was watching a student film. And the score.ugh. Is there a more uninspired way of saying, ""THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT NORMAL FOLK"" than to have Pearl Jam playing throughout? The high-points are the performances, making this film more than a waste. Bale continues to prove he is our generation's Deniro, deftly bringing subtlety and gravitas to every role. Affleck is proceeding to best his more famous brother, Ben, in every role. Saldana is great, and hopefully will be given better material someday. Unfortunately, there is very little for any of these guys to work with here. So no matter how powerful the movie seems to think it is, the mediocre writing and poor direction prove otherwise.",/review/rw3087361/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've seen this movie a couple of times and I think it's great. I heard one reviewer say that it was just despair and ugliness - welcome to the real world buddy. It is that sense of despair and revenge that makes it good. I can only imagine that there is a part of society that lives in that world all the time. It's dark, depressing, and in your face. So it's completely contrary to the artificially happy, sappy movies that seem to be so popular right now. The filmography is good - great lighting, good soundtrack, great setting",/review/rw3087361/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2013,edm-the_red,9," Very Well Done
","Revenge is hardly a fresh concept in film-making. This basic theme, however, here takes a backseat to the styled execution of ""Out of the Furnace."" Told through an all-star cast, the story unfolds slowly, but powerfully. Set in a rural, present-day America, the cinematography captures a beautiful country and glory that is seemingly fading under the weight of war and the economy. The cast skillfully fleshes out the various characters, establishing believability and giving them a rare level of depth. This makes the atmosphere tangible and arguably makes the element of human drama the actual star of the film. The entire cast is excellent and essential, however Christian Bale and Woody Harrelson absolutely steal the show. As the bad-to-the-bone ""villain"" of the script, Harrelson is awesomely despicable, his mere presence on the screen inciting anxiety. Alternately, Bale plays a good but troubled man, condemned to watch his life disintegrate one piece at a time. I caught the director, Scott Cooper, in an interview segment on Carson Daly. He mentioned a desire to impact and ""immerse"" the audience in his movies. In that regard, I would judge this effort to be an undeniable success. During certain scenes, I found myself echoing the actions and emotions depicted on screen, such as dread, liberation, uneasiness, tension, and particularly, a relieved breath of serenity. More drama than action, the tone for me was reminiscent of ""The Place Beyond the Pines"", another well-executed drama with a definite crime flavoring. Also, I felt that the Pearl Jam number that opens and closes the film was a perfect choice for the intended vibe, and deserves a special mention. Overall, this movie is very well done, despite lacking the glamour and flash of an action flick. As a drama, I highly recommend it to fans of the genre.",/review/rw3087361/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2013,bain0038,8," Hard punching and straight forward film delivers
","Scott Cooper takes a sharp turn from the school book tone of his last film Crazy Heart and brings us to a more dismal world in Out of the Furnace. Our hero, Russel Baze, (played smartly by Christian Bale), is a well intentioned and responsible man who in trying to protect his brother meets cruel and cold irony and is sent wayward in this ruined world. Meanwhile his brother returns from deployment with a terrible case of post traumatic stress disorder and brings his chaos into the ""imbred"" and lawless hills of New Jersey, led by the degenerate Harlan Degroat, (Woody Harrelson).",/review/rw3087361/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2013,cyberstud87,8," Bale at his best...
","To be honest, after watching the trailer, i watched this movie only cause it had Bale in it. But it turned out to be surprisingly good with strong performances from everyone involved. Casey Affleck and Zoe Saldana deliver good work on screen. Woody Harelson is also very convincing as the Red neck villain. The director has managed to paint a pretty vivid picture of the environment that he wanted to portray. The storytelling is very engaging. Thumbs up to the director and his team for this effort. In the end, no review can be complete without praising the man who continues to amaze with each performance, Christian Bale. Believable and heart warming in this one. He manages to accomplish the one thing which was most needed from anyone who played this character and that is being able to get the audience to empathize with it. Bale succeeds and then some. Clearly one of his best works till date, and he has an impressive resume already to choose from. A must Watch movie of 2013.",/review/rw3087361/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2013,AaronWidera,5," Fine cast, failure of a script
","The fine cast assembled for this film makes me wonder what they saw in the script. Was it a matter of one actor signing on, and others wanting to work with him (I say him because the only female in the film is Zoe Saldana, in a one-dimensional and thankless role). Was it that the director used to be an actor and knows all these people? Was it because he had success with Crazy Heart?",/review/rw3087361/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2014,kevandeb,8," Like A Meal Without Wine
","Firstly, Christian Bale, like Sean Penn cannot really put a foot wrong in my book, having said that, I was disappointed with his character, far too much focus on mood shots and little on character development. Unlike other reviewers, a slow burn when cast correctly is a joy to watch and for the first hour I thought we had another 'Deerhunters', 'Nil By Mouth', 'Mystic River' & 'North Country' gritty realism of real life, not some $1M bonus farce created by selling hedged funds that 99% of people cannot relate to. However, cracks appeared quickly in how fast Bale was jailed, how quick his woman left him and how little their relationship mattered to the plot. I want to care for the characters and Saldana got zero screen time to care for her, so much so that when she announced her 'big' news, who really cared? Sam Shepherd was woefully underused and in my honest opinion, I felt sorry for the talent not utilized, again showing no respect to the role or character, he may as well have not been there. Whitaker was OK, but again, lack of promotion of the character, why would Saldana choose him over Bale? why would she not visit prison? Prison time was a joke and may as well not have been there. Affleck, whose voice irritates, really stepped up as did Willem Dafoe, who I am really enjoying of late in his roles and finally Woody Harrelson was on fire in this role. What you have here is a film that concentrates its focus in the wrong areas, relying far too much on a good cast list to carry it through and considering it is nearly 2 hours long seems rushed at the end. I still recommend this film simply as watching Bale & Harrelson is like watching Tiger Woods or Ronaldo.....even if they have a bad day, they are worth the entrance fee alone.",/review/rw3087361/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2014,Horst_In_Translation,8," Two hours edge-of-seat stuff
","I would not say that the writing was revolutionary or that any of the acting performances from ""Out of the Furnace"" were particularly outstanding, but you know when a film has Christian Bale, Forest Whitaker and Woody Harrelson in its cast, you will get an expert approach. And it is true. This is a truly great thriller that had me on the edge of the seat from start to finish. Especially that final chase scene with Bale and Harrelson, the last 15 minutes or so, were incredibly intense. There's probably not many out there who can do badass villains as great as Woody. The introduction scene nails it right away and we see who the bad guy in this film is in impressive manner. This helped the movie a lot as it takes quite a while before Harrelson's character reappears again as the film early on focuses on the relationship between the two brothers.",/review/rw3087361/?ref_=tt_urv
