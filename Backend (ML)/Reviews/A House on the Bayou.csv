23 April 2014,vchimpanzee,," Cute fantasy
","Katharine McPhee does a very good job. She's confident and determined and so easy to like. We want her to succeed in everything she wants to do. Plus I know her from ""Smash"". The one negative is her bangs. She's not Zooey Deschanel, who can make that look work. But she is pretty, and her hair looks better later on.",/review/rw8846737/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2017,stevewyzard,8," Hallmark Twilight Zone bliss!
","I was not looking for this movie, but only stumbled across it by accident. Once I figured out the premise, I was hooked. It's a magical fantasy, almost like a modern-day episode of Twilight Zone, yet without any of that show's morbidity. In My Dreams doesn't take itself too seriously, and it's clear that everyone involved had fun with the production.",/review/rw8846737/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2020,mammamia701,7," A Great Fairy Tale
","Katherine McPhee and Mike Vogel star in this movie as the pair looks for their true love via their dreams. I realize that finding your true love through ones dreams is like a science fiction movie. Be assured this movie is a great fairy tale. The backstory of their dreams, which unfolds in the beginning of the movie, begins at a fountain. I don't want to ruin this review with spoilers, therefore I recommend you pop some popcorn and watch. The chemistry between the characters was believable and you keep hoping they will find each other. Of course, being Hallmark, you know they will. It's HOW that makes your heart pound.",/review/rw8846737/?ref_=tt_urv

",This is a different approach to bringing true loves together. A wish in a magic fountain allows Nick and Natalie to occupy each others' dreams. For three nights they blissfully fall in love yet outside their dreams they have never met. But then doubt creeps in which leads to the struggle that occurs in the rest of the movie.,/review/rw8846737/?ref_=tt_urv

23 April 2014,ShariHappenstance,7," Well it wasn't completely bad...
","Before watching the movie, I had read a review (I forget which one exactly) that said McPhee and Vogel had really good on-screen chemistry. It was NO LIE. I literally could not stop smiling as I watched them interact in their dreams. Sure it kind of felt that the relationship was progressing really quickly, but I'll just chalk that up to the fact that neither was certain that the other was real (or if they would meet again) and also the soul mate card. The script itself wasn't anything spectacular but for some reason that didn't stop my heart from pounding every time when... ",/review/rw8846737/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2014,juneebuggy,4," Nothing special in this star crossed lovers story -nothing wrong with it either
","This is one of those Hallmark Hall of Fame movies with the great commercials. I've watched quite a few of them over the years and some are better than others. This one, not so much. I did like the premise but ultimately there was just nothing special or outstanding in this star-crossed lovers story. There wasn't anything particularly wrong with it either though, it's cute, light and will pass a couple hours without any bloodshed. ",/review/rw8846737/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2014,tavm,3," I thought In My Dreams was mostly contrived too much for my taste...
","You know, I like romantic movies if the leading characters are charming enough and the story is believable enough. And maybe the situations and supporting players are also believable enough. But not if things seem contrived enough that I can predict what can happen or think ""How convenient!"" like when this Mario character suddenly declares he's not in love with the leading lady and instead he's into her assistant! And this thing about the Katharine McPhee and Mike Vogel characters actually ""meeting"" each other in a dream and seeing how ""perfect"" they are for each other in Real Life because of those dreams did not completely hold butter or water for me, either! It was nice to see JoBeth Williams, who I long remember from Stir Crazy, Poltergeist, and Switch, on screen again, so there's that. And this wasn't a complete waste of time for me or my mom. It's just if the story doesn't seem real enough for me, I can't completely get into it. But I respect anyone who falls for such trifle...",/review/rw8846737/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2018,westsideschl,2," Dentist
","Seven to ten star reviews seem to use the word ""sweet"" a lot in describing this movie, not to be gender age sensitive, but please grandma you've seen this storyline a thousand and one times already. There was no creative writing, great acting, or thoughtful dialogue to challenge us. What was on the menu here was bad for your health as you would have learned if you had been reading anything lately other than romance novels. It was just another excessive, syrupy ""sweetness"" w/no nutritional value movie. OK, they did add superstitious fountain penny wish fulfillment along w/paranormal dream scenes to the script to make it different. Well, dumb different! After watching this I now have to see the dentist. Oh, that it took four years after TV showing to release on DVD says something about quality.",/review/rw8846737/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2022,skpn123,10," Unique, Inspiring and oh so sweet
",This movie is a standout in the genre - weaves together all the elements so creatively. And beautifully - it is quite an ambitious project but the outcome is lovely - this movie is total fantasy and fun and Katherine McPhee and Mike Vogel have lovely understated chemistry - I hope they work together again.,/review/rw8846737/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2017,kmccabe-,4," Uninspired
","Cheesy rom-com minus the com. Fantasy premise sets the plot in motion (not necessarily a problem) but derailed by failure of the two star-crossed lovers to do or say the obvious things. I believe TV writers call this the ""idiot plot"" - The entire movie could be short-circuited by one or the other of them giving the other a phone number or address, or even just by following up on the numerous hints dropped all over the place. But they're morons, so they don't. ",/review/rw8846737/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2021,athompsonblue,8," Hallmark Inception!

3 March 2022,bryanwoolman,8," Nice Departure
","This is a very late review, however I found this movie to be a very nice departure to the Hallmark cookie cutter formula. Perhaps that is why it is one I never saw before and it is so different.",/review/rw8846737/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2016,Ana_Banana,4," Too good a premise for that crew
","When they start from a most unpredictable and intriguing premise (a perfect match only in lucid dreams) and end it in an epitome of especially thin rom-com formulas, we must admit that the result deserves a special mention as an achievement in spoiling a theme. Everything in this was painfully predictable and clich√©, convenient and mushy. The actors weren't impressive at all, nor particularly likable, the script and directing are boring, and so on. Everything is overplayed, even the lucid dreams thingy, a state which could not occur so mechanically and regularly every night to anyone. There is an excellent novel with a similar twist (a parallel life in a, well, let's say in a lucid dream, not to spoil it for potential readers): 'Comfort and Joy', by Kristin Hannah. That book would be captivating if set on screen, because it's really surprising and well written, unlike this lame trifle of a flick.",/review/rw8846737/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2014,Sparta2k22,8," In my Dreams - 8/10 !
",That was a pretty enjoyable movie to watch. it makes you wonder what happens next until they catch up together. Watch it when you are bored/ have nothing to do or even with your partner/family etc.,/review/rw8846737/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2022,bebelinha-66296,3," The lack of chemistry between the protagonists is impressive
","I only knew they were interested in each other because the movie told me so a hundred times. If it hadn't, I would assume they are brother and sister separated at birth. Every scene with them is awkward and forced, in some of them it even looks like the actors are annoyed.",/review/rw8846737/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2021,cgvsluis,5," The legend says you toss a coin and for seven nights you dream of your true love.""
","This film has a very romantic premise. Two strangers, draftsman Nick and restaurant owner Natalie, begin seeing each other in their dreams. They walk, talk and get to know one another all the while dreaming night after night.",/review/rw8846737/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2023,yearningandlearning,7," Good romance movie
","I think this has the workings of a great romance movie, but the ending feels a bit incomplete. I wish they'd have shown more scenes of the couple together in reality, so that we have a sense of how they fit in with each others' families and friends. The whole selling point is that they're perfect for each other, so it'd have been great if we saw how that works compared to before they met.",/review/rw8846737/?ref_=tt_urv
