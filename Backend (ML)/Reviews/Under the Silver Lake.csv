10 August 1998,Keyser-15,," A tale of two films
","I was a little disappointed when I left this film, but not because of the overall result. I was disappointed because of the wonderful way in which the story was laid out and unfolded itself in the beginning, then seemed to fall away during its 2nd act. The reverse theme of bad kids turning good was fascinating, and the paranoid performance by Nick Stahl was worth watching and intrigued me. But then, as soon as Stahl was converted, the film started to fall apart. For one Stahl was the only character I found to be truly worth watching. Marsden and Holmes were just two pretty faces noticeably void of much talent; I never believed the two as a couple, and I never found any reason to invest myself in hoping for their well-being other the fact they were the lesser of two evils. But most noticeably, I grew disinterested because of the change in aim by the makers. The first half of the film, which by itself I would have given an 8 or 9 out of 10, was more of a grown-up horror movie, where the situation and plot rather than actions dictated the fear of the audience. But after Stahl disappears to the dark side, the film changed into a teen slasher film almost, where blood, violence and screaming is used in a vain attempt to induce fright. This 2nd half was worth a 4 or 5 out of 10. The length did not bother me as much as others (I've seen plenty of effective movies that were under 90 minutes). What bothered me more was the lack of development in some key plot points. I think the entire conspiracy plot behind the conversion of the teens needed to be fleshed out much more, characters needed to be drawn more distinctly, and so on. So I balance out the two halves and come up with a 6 out of 10. Worth renting, but could have been something special.",/review/rw3411170/?ref_=tt_urv

","After the suicide of the teenager Allen Clark (Ethan Embry), his family decides to move from Chicago to the quiet Cradle Bay Island seeking a peaceful life for the siblings Steve (James Marsden) and Lindsay Clark (Katharine Isabelle). When Steve joins the local high-school, the outcast Gavin Strick (Nick Stahl) befriends Steve and introduces his also rejected friend Rachel Wagner (Katie Holmes) to the newcomer. Gavin exposes to Steve in the refectory the punks, the nerds and the different tribes of the school and he defends the weird theory that a sinister force changes the behavior of the annoyingly perfect ""Blue Ribbons"", a group of good students that wear identical jackets and gather in the Yogurt Shoppe. Further he tells that he had witnessed the blue ribbon Andy Efkin (Tobias Mehler) killing their schoolmate Mary Jo (Natassia Malthe) that is missing and the local Officer Cox (Steve Railsback) covering the murder. Steve does not believe on Gavin words, but when his friend is submitted to the treatment of Dr. Edgar Caldicott (Bruce Greenwood) and immediately changes his behavior, joining the Blue Ribbons, Steve and Rachel decides to investigate the mystery discovering the dark secret of the perfect behavior.",/review/rw3411170/?ref_=tt_urv

","A sci-fi/horror flick aimed at the ""Scream"" crowd, ""Disturbing Behavior"" concerns at idyllic coastal town where everything seems just a bit too peachy. The local high school is populated by picture perfect teens who, despite their wholesome love of yogurt, tend to get a little trigger happy when the hormones start flying.

17 October 2003,one4now4,," Very sadly underrated
","This is a very sadly underrated film. This is a film that I believe was intended to wake kids up. It's no artistic venture, I know. It's all laid out in a very simple fashion, and was made for the MTV kids to be able to understand it. Still, the point is a great one, and was carried out well. After reading someone's review of this, I have to say I was enraged. The good guys sometimes smoke pot in this. Would it be worse if they were on crack? Yes, it would. The good guys look a little freaky most of the time. Would it make them better people if they wore ""nice clothes""? No, it wouldn't. They cuss a lot and talk their weird, poetic jive. Would they be more interesting if they didn't? No, they would be LESS interesting. The good guys like rock music. Does that make them bad, scary kids? Absolutely not, because you can't judge a person solely on their tastes. And as for the brainwashed psycho kids that even a lot of kids nowadays would root for, they break people's necks because they're ashamed to be sexually aroused. Is that less scary than a kid who just wants to get laid and can't because he's viewed as a monster by society? If your answer is ""yes"", you are obviously very disturbed yourself. This movie is about the underdogs, those people who are good people but have no choice other than to fight when so many would rather oppress them for being who they really are. This hardens and depresses them considerably, and why shouldn't it? The world is not a ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"", and, though that is a nice fantasy, this movie, despite any fantastic contexts it might have, is full of harsh realities. If there's a world full of Blue Ribbons, things wouldn't be exciting to you unless you're totally brainwashed. If you're not, that makes it scary. That's why this movie sends chills up my spine, no matter how simple and MTV-styled it might be. This is one of the best horror films of the 1990s. At least it's not junk like ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". This film has something to say, something only severely distorted people would see as completely negative and wrong. NOT FOR BLUE RIBBONS!",/review/rw3411170/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2007,disdressed12,8," Disturbing behavior-to say the least
","Disturbing behavior is the tale of a small coastal town where once unruly teens are transformed into academic geniuses.even stranger is that they all dress the same,join the same clubs,act the same.like soulless automatons.when Steve Clark(James Marsden)moves into town,he makes friends with the three misfits:Rachel Wagner(Katie Holmes),Gavin Strick(Nick Stahl) and U.V(Chad Donela).once the three realize the reason for the abrupt behavior changes,they must find a way to stop it,before they are next.Bruce Greenwood,(Thirteen Days,Deja Vu)William Sadler,(The Green Mile,Hard to Kill,Ethan Embry(Harold and Kumar go to White Castle,Sweet Home Alabama)and Katherine Isabelle(Earthsea,Insomnia)also have roles in the film.i thought this was a pretty good film.the premise is not original,but so what.the movie is very dark and will be thought provoking for some,while others will simply enjoy it for it's entertainment value.either way,it's worth watching. 8/10",/review/rw3411170/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2005,bigwig_thalyi,8," stepford children on acid
","This is basically a modern take on the Sepford children but with added sexual content and more graphic detail. The premise is this.After the death of his brother ,young teen Steven Clark, played by James Marsden, X Men,moves to the seemingly innocent town of Cradle Bay with his family.At first everything seems normal.The children are typical teens but when they get a red light in their eyes they become totally different. Steven makes friends with a weird group of outsiders including Katie Holmes who warn him that something is going on.He remains sceptical till he gets beaten up by a group of the teens and realises that something is terribly wrong. In this film you are never quite sure who is what and look out for the seemingly retarded janitor whose role is pivotal in the outcome of the movie. This film reminded me of the film The Faculty in many respects but wasn't as good. I saw this at 9.00 on channel 5 so it was probably cut but it still an enjoyable romp into the world of mind control and the scene in the hospital sticks in the memory. The cast did well but William sadler, as the janitor, did especially well and James Marsden and Katie Holmes show good chemistry. This film is not in my top ten fave movies but good for an hour and a half of escapism. Good film but the twist can be seen a mile away. My score 8/10",/review/rw3411170/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2005,Coventry,2," Cute looking teen-idols are hardly disturbing...
","The makers of ""Disturbing Behavior"" proudly call this a horror film, but anyone who has the slightest bit of experience with this (usually) wonderful genre will only label it as childish, pitiful nonsense. The plot is obviously stolen from ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", only it's severely simplified so that fans of dud high-school shows like ""Beverly Hills 90210"" can get some thrills out of it. The evil school psychiatrist (!) of Cradle Bay island plants computer chips into the brains of mediocre students and, overnight, they mutate into grade-A model adolescents. New arrival Steve Clark teams up with pothead Gavin and hottie Rachel to prevent this from happening to them. Not a single storyline in the script is adequately explained (the reason behind Steve's brother's suicide, the flaws of the 'good behavior'-program, the connection with rodents, etc...) and whenever the film threatens to become too incoherent, the camera quickly zooms in on Katie Holmes sexy belly in order to distract your attention. The attempts to create suspense and mystery are laughable, the use of clichés and stereotypes is dreadful and many lines are vaguely offensive. The climax is hilarious, though. Good actors, like William Sadler and Steve Railsback, make fools out of themselves in the supportive cast. High-school horror was inexplicably popular near the end of the 1990, but this film is the absolute low point of them all. Better watch ""The Faculty""...or even ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"".",/review/rw3411170/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2004,swayland7,7," Easy to Dismiss, but Worth a Look
","Disturbing Behavior is a difficult film for a serious movie critic to defend, primarily because of a long-standing prejudice to both the teen and horror genres. Granted, few teen movies are designed to treat their subjects with any degree of seriousness. And of all the film genres, horror is kept alive with only the slightest bit of effort, accompanied by even slighter expectations. But director David Nutter tackles both these obstacles in a rare attempt to sophisticate Hollywood's offerings to teen audiences and bring dignity to the maligned horror genre. Despite a screenplay written contrary to his vision, Nutter succeeds in creating a dramatic, moody, and entertaining sci-fi/horror yarn far more difficult to dismiss than its contemporary equivalents. That is, until MGM destroyed it.",/review/rw3411170/?ref_=tt_urv

Nick Stahl plays Steve's new friend, Katie Holmes a potential girlfriend and Katharine Isabelle his sister.

","Steve and his sister are moved with to this sleepy little coastal island community after the suicide of his older parents. Soon it becomes apparent that the 'popular' click involving bake-sale throwing straight A'ers are actually programmed zombies and Steve is next in line. But when several 'incidents' threaten to destroy the program can Steve and his sister (with a few ragtag friends) get out of there with their own minds. 'Disturbing Behavior' is a solid 'Stepford Wives' like thriller directed by David Nutter who cut his teeth on episodes of 'The X-Files' and 'Millennium' does a good job with the material. The acting by the core (James Marsden, Katie Holmes and Nick Stahl) cast is very good, also keep and eye out for Bill Sadler and Steve Railsback in scene-chewing supporting rolls. Better than your average teen thriller / horror 'Disturbing Behavior' is also a solid retelling of 'The Stepford Wives'.",/review/rw3411170/?ref_=tt_urv

",First I want to say I love Katie Holmes to death and I really miss the actress. She was so great in the 90's until 2005 when Tom Cruise turned her around and mess her career. Katie Holmes is a wonderful actress beautiful sexy babe and talented in this movie that is one of the reason's why I think this movie is so good and it is not because of James Marsden but because of Katie Holmes. She was so great in Dawson's Creek I watched that show mainly because of Katie. She was damn good in Go and she was a bad-ass in Teaching Mrs. Tingle. I haven't seen her in Pieces of April but I am sure it must be a good movie. I miss the actress after Batman Begins I don't see her on screen time anymore it feel's like she disappeared. In this movie she was so damn awesome and she had such a charm and she was hot.

21 September 2000,EdgarST,9," Stepford Kids in Parallax Land
","This tight little horror film tells a very simple story in 84 minutes, with remarkable narrative economy, relying on information that the viewer already knows (from many genres: horror movies, science-fiction, thrillers, teen flicks) to fill the gaps. It reminded me of the old Hammer films: effective and to the point, while at the same time ""The Stepford Wives"", ""The Parallax View"" and even ""The Pied Piper of Hamelin"" came to mind. With all those references and its clever satire on patriotism, it is plausible that the movie does not take itself too serious and does not have the ridiculous grave tone of bad films like ""The Craft"". Fortunately, the writers don't even try to elaborate on characters that are the classic elements of the horror genre: mad scientist, monster(s), good boy, bad girl turned good, good boy turned bad, good girl in danger, a ""hunchback"" (who reads Vonnegut); and director Nutter, with an extensive experience in television, delivers fast and efficiently.

","This movie had me hiding in the other room for most scenes. It was absolutely terrifying! I loved the part where they befriend the janitor at the end and all get in his car and drive. Such a wholesome ending! I also loved the part right at the end when Gavin shows up and becomes a teacher. I was on the edge of my seat! Will he kill them? Will he teach them? I sadly never get an answer to my question as the film is cut short. I suspect the ending was too good they had to cut it. I think an extra 2 hours would have been a sufficient way to end this masterpiece. The best part of the movie though, was when Steve sits down with the rat people. I was so scared I had briefly turn off my tv and take a break from the film. The suspense was too much!
