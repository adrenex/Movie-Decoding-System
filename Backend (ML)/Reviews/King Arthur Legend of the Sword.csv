27 July 2005,Sulla-2,," Dalziel may not be real but this is how a senior Policeman should be
","This is easily one of my favourite UK Police series. Although it is called Dalziel & Pascoe, Superintendent Andy Dalziel, played effortlessly by the experienced Warren Clarke is easily the star of the show. He may not be real, but he is how senior Detectives should be. Hard drinking, perhaps a bit uncouth/crude, but also clever and someone who really does care. He is also a bit of a comedian, who has an habit of calling his staff by well known Nicknames. DC Harris is Bomber, DS Milligan is Spike, DC Novello is Ivor and WPC Jackson is Janet. The programme is set is Yorshire but because it is produced by the Birmingham studios a lot a scenes are shot in the West Midlands. There are now over 30 episodes and the early episodes also chronicle the progress of DS Pascoe's ( Later Detectective Inspector) family. An other regular, who has been absent for the past few episodes is DS Edgar Wield. The rugged Sergeant Wield is gay, but this is only occasionally referred to.",/review/rw1660796/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2010,TheLittleSongbird,9," Edgy, well acted and well written show
","I love detective shows and have done for as long as I can remember. Dalziel and Pascoe is no exception. I agree to some extent it is not quite as good as it was, with the introduction with the somewhat bland Kim Spicer, but on the whole it is well acted and well written, and while it has lost its edge a bit it is quite intense still. The photography and locations are excellent and the music is haunting(courtesy of genius Barrington Pheloung), while the writing is both humorous and intelligent and the stories and episode ideas gritty, edgy, complex and incredibly engrossing. The characters in general are likable and interesting, with Dalziel unorthodox but clever and quite funny sometimes and Pascoe loyal but sticks to the book. The acting is great, with Warren Clarke easily stealing the show, then again I don't know about you but Dalziel is for me the better character of the two but they're both great. Overall, great show. 9/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw1660796/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2011,pensman,9," Solid stories with great actors
","A great series. Warren Clarke is great as DS Andy Dalziel (literally DL);his character is tough, hard as nails, earthy, and brilliant. He is the show. Obviously a self-made detective who without an ""education"" has been promoted up the ranks to superintendent and somehow missed the refinements he might have been expected to pick up. He is paired with Colin Buchanan as DI Peter Pascoe, a well educated college man who I find a bit of a prat and a snob who believes he is better than his boss. He is paired with a wife, Susannah Corbett, who really dislikes Dalziel. To be honest, I hoped her character would be murdered at some point during the series as I find her totally obnoxious which might be a tribute to her acting. ",/review/rw1660796/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2010,b_clerkin,," Not Quite Like the Novels, But Worth Watching
","I love Reginald Hill's novels upon which these shows were based and having read the lot, I have to agree with others in saying that the cast is less than accurate, though Warren Clarke and David Royle come closer in spirit to their book counterparts, if not physically. Colin Buchanan is too insubstantial to make Pascoe as strong as he is in the books and Susannah Corbett, while getting Ellie's smug self-satisfied know-it-allness down pat, looks and acts too hard - she fails to relay the bits of vulnerable sweetness of the book Ellie that makes it clear why Pascoe adores her. That being said, the stories remain fairly true to the novels, if far less bawdy and they retain much of the dark Northern humor that makes the books so enjoyable. With Clarke lacking the sheer bulk and crudity of the book Fat Andy, the scenes demonstrating his brilliance as a detective and perspicacity about the human condition are far less surprising than when they emerge in the novels. Even after you've read several of the stories, Hill makes Dalziel so obnoxious and primitive, you can visualize the scrapes on his knuckles from dragging them on the ground, when his genius and sensitivity lead to the truth - and that is what Dalziel is all about, getting to the truth - it still startles. However, judging the TV versions without considering the novel versions, the series is a cut above the standard fare in the UK, let alone the US, and is literate, funny, intriguing and thoroughly enjoyable. The acting, direction, pacing and scenery are completely credible and it is a treat to suspend reality to watch this - and the other UK coppers like Barnaby, Frost, Morse, et al.",/review/rw1660796/?ref_=tt_urv

1 September 2007,korvexe,10," Better than Midsomer Murders
","We are in the middle of season 7 at the moment in Sweden, and I've been watching it since season 4. And I must say that I've liked what I've seen so far. Every summer they show Midsomer Murders on Swedish television, and I USED to enjoy that show until I found this masterpiece. Here the characters and environments are more realistic, the plots are more complex and interesting, and the endings are not alway crystal clear, which, for the thriller-interested viewer, is quite satisfying. The ongoing Dalziel-Pascoe relationship is probably the best in its genre, and Dalziel's one-liners sometimes make you laugh your head off! I hope they will continue to show Dalziel and Pascoe in Sweden, although I don't think it's well known here. It's as good as Frost, and much better than the latest seasons of Midsomer Murders. UK can certainly make my evenings a lot more fun.",/review/rw1660796/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2018,qui_j,8," Brilliant cast but shoddy editing and writing
","Finally got around to watching the first 7 seasons on Britbox here in the US. Love the cast and hope that the channel will have all the seasons at some point as I hated to let go of the characters. My only complaint was to do with the editing, which seemed to stick scenes together in an unrelated manner that was very confusing at times. The endings of a few of the episodes were also not very defined as there did not seem to be a proper explanation given throughout each episode as how it all fitted together! Left me wondering what the point of the story was. Even with its not so positive points, it's a great series to watch, especially if you know the Yorkshire area well.",/review/rw1660796/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2005,roberts-alex,," A truly classic detective drama
","'Dalziel and Pascoe' is one of the greatest television programmes of all time. Based on the books by Reginald Hill, the show follows the work of Superintendent Andy Dalziel (Warren Clarke) and DI Peter Pascoe(Colin Buchanan), as they investigate and solve murders. Despite their obvious differences in personality and outlook, Dalziel and Pascoe soon become an effective partnership, and good friends. The show has certainly evolved over the many years it's been on our screens, with most of the early episodes being close adaptations of the books, whereas recently the writers have thought up original, and often superior story lines for the show. What really sets this series apart from other modern detective dramas is its gritty realism and complex plotting. With every episode of 'Dalziel and Pascoe' you are guaranteed an unpredictable and intelligent mystery, played out by excellent actors in atmospheric and realistic locations.",/review/rw1660796/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2014,candidcamel,10," Adore! *In My Top 5 Crime Series (New Tricks is First, this 2nd.)
","RIP Warren Clarke November 2014. I am finishing watching this series this Holiday Season in a tribute to Warren's recent passing. Warren Clarke is absolutely BRILLIANT in this series. I first found it via Masterpiece Mysteries on my US PBS channel back in the 90's. After that, it was hard to find, until nice folkes uploaded episodes. I have watched Series 1-11 at least once a year for the past 5 years. I have waited for it to be available in the US and now you can order via Walmart.com...wonderful site. Will be purchasing for my birthday in January 2015. This, New Tricks and my other favourite UK Series will be added as $ allows. Back to Dalziel & Pascoe. I am 62, a film/TV buff since a wee child. Soupy Sales comes to mind when thinking of Andy Dalziel. Out of thousands of TV Characters seen over the years. Andy is truly in my Top 10. His thick Gaelic Brogue and his ""true-to-reality"" male behaviour are EPIC. You must watch a few episodes to realize Andy's HEART...some may be appalled with his ""nose-picking"", ball-scratching, lip-smacking"" humouristic, characteristics. This is perhaps THE MOST REAL CHARACTER ever seen on TV. He is not your typical ""Lovable Barnaby"" DI, and not for fans of ""Nicely Nice"" DIs, calmly moving toward the obvious suspects. Dalziel will venture wild accusations, then apologize if he's wrong, and ""gloat"" as Peter Pascoe chides him, when he is found to be right. Dalziel is not a Politically Correct PC, he is unapologetically irreverent and brash. However, if you watch long enough, you will see Dalziel CRY soft sobbing tears in the face of loss and tragedy. I have never seen Barnaby cry. I guess the best way to put it, is...(Midsomer Murders which I love, finds an Adorable 1 Dimensional Barnaby) ANDY DALZIEL, is a MULTI-faceted character, a 3F man with flaws, failures & foibles. I have found him to be an admirable character. He is WISE, LOYAL, ""A Dog With A Bone (me too)"" and KIND with consideration. The Dalziel & Pascoe Series teaches that some crimes are resolved with ""FATE"" and lives lived with melancholy, instead of ""booty"". I love the supporting characters as well, although I hated ""Ellie"", Peter's wife...She was stunning to watch, beautiful and acted well, however, sad to watch her belittle Peter. Wieldy, the big silent softy, is a joy to watch and he provides a great supporting character to the mix. The female supporting cast members were fairly great as well...currently watching Posh Spicer, and she is good in her part and plays in 20 episodes. I haven't said much about Peter, sometimes I love Peter and sometimes, I simply want to smack him...His character is much more flawed than Andy's...While Andy loyalty is constant, Peter vasillates and has periods of doubt and suspicions. He is a brooding character, quite melancholy, but no Dalziel & Pascoe without Pascoe. There have been several characters that I have hated they killed off. Well enough...A QUITE WORTHY WELCOME Series and again, Andy stands alone with Alum Armstrong as Brian Lane in New Tricks as the MOST OUTSTANDING UK characters EVER! and to the person dissing this for A Touch Of Frost...I love that show as well...and the character FROST...he might be my 3rd., 4th or 5th. favourite DI.. WATCH IF YOU DARE! Not a sugar cookie, but a MACAROON!",/review/rw1660796/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2007,gtbarker,4," Oh dear what have the BBC done?
","This used to be a great TV series, until the 'reformers' got their PC focus group mits on it. Regular viewers will know what I'm talking about: when they changed the excellent original theme music (moody saxophone solo from the pen of Barrington Pheloung) and that accompanied a change in line-up. Out went the brilliantly under-played character of DS Edgar 'Wieldy' Wield (played by the excellent David Royle) and in came the 'I can't act for toffee and I've even got an annoyingly grating accent' Jennifer James in the role of WPC Kim Spicer and the inconsequential Wayne Perrey as DC Parvez Lateef. The show started out broodingly edgy and is now a faint shadow of its former self with the team now seeming more like the Scooby Gang than the hard-bitten original version. So come on BBC - less of the Kim Scrappy-Doo Spicer and let's get back to the original idea I used to love. The old show would get an 8 from me, but this incarnation struggles to get a 4.",/review/rw1660796/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am an avid fan of Reginald Hill's Dalziel and Pascoe series (I own all the books, most in hardback; I even know the correct way -- Andy's way, at least -- of pronouncing Dalziel...""Dee-al"") and have been able to view a few -- a VERY few -- episodes of the British series here in the USA. But certainly not 12 seasons' worth -- even if they had only 2 or 3 episodes per season. And I can understand -- from comments made by contributors to IMDb -- that once they ran out of Hill's stories the writing very well may have suffered. But does anyone know if more ever will be broadcast in the USA; and whether the DVDs (in appropriate formatting for the USA) ever will be offered for sale here? Please...someone help me.

","Watching this Cop Duo Of "" Superintendent Andy Dalziel"" (Warren Clarke) and 'DI Peter Pascoe' (Colin Buchanan) together Is A Joy and a pleasure to watch! Many Cop dramas are cliches and pure fiction, that it also makes them laughable & unwatchable. This Superb written Cop Drama is interesting and more true to life, due to the shenanigans and intelligence of Superintendent Dalziel...spoken..Dee-el. He can be obnoxious, crude and irritating; but doesn't he do well..😊 He is hilarious and those one liners are hysterical. The show grips you and keeps you in suspense, and each of the storylines are intriguing and exillerating. Each episode is completely different from the previous one, and the supporting cast are always great too. Pascoes' character is one of a friend as well as a partner, and they both work well together, even though Dalziel is the 'Boss unquestionably 😄 If you get the chance to watch this Classic Drama...Please Do So, as you Will become hooked.!!!
12 series that evolved with each (although I did miss the character of 'Sgt Weildy'.. what happened?) He seemed to fit in and blend well with the Cop duo..A real shame his character dissapear.
I Recommend You Try & Watch if you can.!!!

","This series is the epitome of the concept that you have to scoff, abuse, badmouth, down talk, jeer and deride your inferiors to get the best out of them. Clues are handed to Dalziel and his team without any proper investigation and usual by people who get scoffed at by Dalziel. Not a word of thanks will ever pass his lips. What Dalziel actually does for a living is unknown because he just follows the trail of corpses to find the perpetrator. Not very difficult because with each death the circle of suspects diminishes. Lucky for D and his team the baddie get's whacked off at the end or confesses his guilt because none of the evidence or methods used to acquire them would stand up in court. The investigation general sees D and his trusty sidekick Pascoe talk to various people who talk and talk and then say something that doesn't fit the story of others. ""Aha"" they will say! The two investigators will drop the hint to the public so they will know if they had missed it.

11 June 2018,mdjedovic,5," An uneven series eventually winds up trudging the mud of formulaic-procedural cliches
","Reginald Hill is one of the most inventive, original, and unusual crime-writers that have ever lived. In fact, he's so good he's managed to twist the genre he's operating in around so much that I hesitate to even call him a crime-writer at all. Most of his novels are actually clever exercises in genre-twisting and metatextuality with tons of references to obscure classic literature, self-parody, and real, well-developed, three-dimensional characters. It's crime-writing for people who don't like crime-writing or mystery fans with philosophy diplomas. He's a genius.
This is why it was so surprising to hear that BBC were planning to mount an adaptation of his works. Yes, he's successful and his novels sold well but could his style be carried over to television? How can something so genre-bending, rule busting, and metatextual be carried over to a format whose audience demands a level of cosines not provided by an author of Hill's standing?
Well, the answer is unpredictably but decidedly odd as watching the first four series of ""Dalziel and Pascoe"" is like listening to someone retell the plots of the novels after having skimmed them some years back. Sure, the plots are there, and so are the characters, but they have been sanitised beyond recognition so there's barely any traces left of Hill's unique style at all. Oh sure, the show WAS good. It had engaging mysteries, good humour, and the characters were still three-dimensional and likeable, but what made the novels so unique and so beloved was their originality which was now gone. Thus the first series proceeds quite by-the-book, in a manner interchangeable with some of those bland ITV crime dramas of the time (with the sole exception of ""Morse"" which was always and will always be singularly and unexpectedly brilliant). I enjoyed all three episodes for their humour, I played along with the mysteries, but as I type this I have trouble remembering them very well. I do know that out of all three I enjoyed ""An Advancement of Learning"" the most as it had a little of that Reginald Hill sparkle left somewhere in it.
The second series, however, was a huge surprise as among the other three rather bland and forgettable episodes comes ""Deadheads"". The only episode of ""Dalziel and Pascoe"" that nails the feel of a Reginald Hill novel exactly. Hilarious, uncomprosing, and genre busting it must have done the author very proud as it stands head-and-shoulders (and any other extremity you can think of) above the other episodes. This is probably because it was written by Alan Plater, a genius in his own right and the author of the equally bendy ""The Beiderbecke Affair"". Sadly, ""Dalziel and Pascoe"" never reclaims the glory of ""Deadheads"".
Series three is slightly better than the other three episodes of series two but after ""Deadheads"" seems curiously bland. ""Child's Play"" is a very fine mystery episode and it could even rank with some of the better ""Morses"" and ""Bones and Silence"" is a good adaptation coming close to but not quite achieving the greatness of ""Deadheads"".
Then something telling happened. Halfway through series four the producers abandoned Reginald Hill's novels in favour of writing original scripts which brought about the show's failure. Up until this point it sort of hung on a thin thread as its terrific characters at least had interesting plots to work through. From series five onwards, however, all this would be gone and everything from that point on is pure, plodding procedural stuff without wit or imagination. Oh sure, a good episode would sneak in from time to time, but even those (like Glenn Chandler's ""Guardian Angel"") are merely formulaic stuff with a little glimmer of unusual wit (for this show at least) thrown in. The show eventually winds up trudging the mud of formulaic-procedural cliches to such an extent I can't really remember even the episodes I watched recently. I tend to get them mixed up with other dull procedurals such as ""Silent Witness"", later seasons of ""Vera"", or ""Waking the Dead"". And, to think that, had the BBC played their cards right, ""Dalziel and Pascoe"" could have been their ""Midsomer Murders"" only with a philosophical edge to it.
Funnily enough, series four contains an episode that comes the closest to a Reginald Hill novel besides ""Deadheads"". It's called ""The British Grenadier"" and it's an involving and unusual story of a hostage situation in a pub brilliantly directed by Maurice Phillips , a TV great gone too soon. What's so funny about it is that it is an original script. It's the only ""Dalziel and Pascoe"" original to reach any sort of greatness.
A few years down the line, another Hill adaptation would be attempted in the form of ""Dialogues of the Dead"", but the result was a stodgy, hopelessly boring, and plodding procedural with such an appalling lack of wit and imagination I'm sure Mr Hill would have rather had his name off it. Penultimate series' episode ""Houdini's Ghost"" was likewise adapted from a Hill novel but so loosly and badly that the less said of it the better.
The real tragedy of ""Dalziel and Pascoe"", however, is the fact that it had the perfect cast. The always brilliant Warren Clarke was spot on as the vulgar, grumpy, overweigth Andy Dalziel and Colin Buchanan provided a worthy foil in the form of the wiry. politically correct DI Pascoe. Also wonderful was David Royle as DS Wield, easily one of the most interesting characters ever to show up on a procedural. Susannah Corbett was an excellent Ellie too, treading that fine line between annoying and likeable with staggering ease.
Overall, ""Dalziel and Pascoe"" proves that old adage about producers having no balls. Its a saddening mainstream-isation of a series of enchantingly oddball books that had wit, smarts, and originality, three things to be avoided on consumerist television
Still, ""Dalziel and Pascoe"" is fine entertainment for a rainy day if you can stomach heavily formulaic procedurals. If your into more edgier stuff (and if you like Reginald Hill) you probably are. Go watch ""Deadheads"" and then transition to ""The Beiderbecke Affair"". You'll find it to be more of your cup of tea.",/review/rw1660796/?ref_=tt_urv
