6 August 2019,elizabethcaroline,10," Best Seth Rogen Movie Yet
","I actually downloaded this movie, but avoided it for a long time, thinking it would be awful. It is the best movie I've seen in a very long time. An environmentalist and presidential hopeful employs a neighbor from her childhood as her speechwriter. If you know Seth Rogen, you know his comedy. It is both raunchy and witty, and altogether surprising that I fell in love with it. This is a love story of the strangest, and most authentic caliber.",/review/rw4854100/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2019,bjpafa,8," Eight for a forgotten genre
","Congratulations.
Romantic comedy, serious derivatives.
Nice cast, hilarious and moving scenes, not a shallow piece of art.
Because it's a fairy tale, and we want to belive. Even when one denies it all.
Try it again.
I was lucky to have chosen to watch.
We have to insist on this kind of midfull, light approach to serious issues.
Au revoir.",/review/rw4854100/?ref_=tt_urv

25 March 2021,athena24,7," Good writing
","Really nice romantic comedy carried mostly by good cast and clever writing. The balance between romance and comedy works and leans slightly towards the latter having enough funny jokes to hold the movie. The writing is witty and somewhat original. Not everywhere, but for the majority it feels so. It's not that all jokes land well, but there are enough that do, which kept me entertained through the whole movie. And while non of them made me grab my belly, they were certainly funny. Somehow, the writers also managed to avoid the obvious territories, such as sex and toilet jokes. The cast makes the movie work. Charlize Theron is exceptional. She just gets better and better with every role she plays. Always so delightful to watch her. June Diane Raphael was also a great casting choice. Seth Rogen is certainly not my cup of coffee but he fits the role. It is more mature than the usual Seth Rogen role/movie - which I think is a good thing.",/review/rw4854100/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2020,swordsnare,7," It was a Long Shot, but I enjoyed it.
","Surprisingly enough, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. But to be honest, who wouldn't want to play Charlize Theron's love interest in a film. Typical unrealistic romcom scenario, but it doesn't really matter that much.",/review/rw4854100/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2019,SnoopyStyle,7," fine rom-com
",Far-left journalist Fred Flarsky (Seth Rogen) quits his job when his paper gets bought out by right-wing media mogul Parker Wembley (Andy Serkis). His best friend Lance (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) brings him to a party featuring Boyz II Men. There he runs into Secretary of State Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron) who happens to be his childhood crush and former babysitter. She decides to hire him as her speech writer for her impending Presidential run. President Chambers (Bob Odenkirk) is a former TV actor who only wants to be a movie star rather than run for re-election. Maggie Millikin (June Diane Raphael) and Tom (Ravi Patel) are Charlotte's ever-present assistants. James Steward (Alexander Skarsgård) is the hot Canadian Prime Minister.,/review/rw4854100/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2019,flinx-52179,8," This movie isn't for everyone, but it was for me. It honestly made me laugh
","I actually don't understand all the highly negative reviews. There isn't enough things in the world to laugh about and this comedy is one of them. It wasn't perfect, but it had a reasonable message and definitely had some funny scenes",/review/rw4854100/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2019,rehmankhilji,7," Beautiful, perfect, humor filled movie
","A must watch, a treat altogether. Charlize Theron and Seth Rogen, actors way too different in their acting has really made their roles entertaining. Comic timings of Seth as always is perfect and Charlize has performed equally well.
It has everything an entertaining movie requires and at no point you will feel any boredom.",/review/rw4854100/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2019,asifahsankhan,8," Theron is a movie star of indefatigable range. Hell, I'd vote for her.
","Politics is a game of appearances and navigating mass appeal, of course, and it's doubly hard for a woman, no matter how beautiful, how solid her policy positions; early focus groups score Charlotte in the 90th percentile, but ""if you were a man, you'd be in the '190s,"" Lisa Kudrow's press manager admits. The key to ensuring her electability? To bring her 'humor' factor up a few points, to make her seem more relatable to the American public. After all, a woman can't just be smart and capable - she has to be one of the guys, as well. On top of that, she has to be fodder for romantic gossip, whether with Fred or the gormless Justin Trudeau-like James Steward (Alexander Skarsgård), with his toothy grin and inoffensive good looks.",/review/rw4854100/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2019,cardsrock,8," Hilarious and topical
",It's fun to root for the underdog. It's also fun to watch Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron try to one up each other in vulgar jokes and funny antics. This film doesn't try to surprise you. It's more focused on sweeping you up in its layered story and sharp humor. I enjoyed seeing a seemingly one-sided film like this try to put forth a good message about compromising with those who have different views than you. You honestly have to be pretty jaded and bitter to not find some enjoyment in a feel-good story like this.,/review/rw4854100/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2020,aidanratesmovies,10," Hilarious and absolutely heartwarming
","Hilarious without ever seeming like too much, Long Shot is yet another modern comedic classic from director Jonathan Levine, and is easily the best comedy of the year. Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron make for a surprisingly great pair, and the two share a chemistry on screen that is greater than either of them have received with another actor for quite some time. The film can take a bit to start going, but once it does, its mindlessly entertaining, and very sweet in all the right ways. The film is often shot well, its jokes and dialogue executed almost perfectly on screen, and the music choices are surprisingly very well thought out and very appetizing. In the end, Long Shot is one film I never expected to enjoy as much as I did, but it didn't leave me just with a smile on my face, but a full heart as well- as all rom-coms should.
My Rating: 9.75/10",/review/rw4854100/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2019,masonsaul,9," Heartwarming romantic comedy
","Long Shot is a slightly predictable but also consistently really funny and heartwarming romantic comedy. Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron give incredible performances and have perfect chemistry. The majority of the jokes work, Bob Odenkirk, Andy Serkis and June Diane Raphael are all great and O'Shea Jackson Jr. gives a scene stealing and extremely funny supporting performance. It's also well paced and Jonathan Levine's direction is really good. The soundtrack is fantastic and the music by Marco Beltrami and Miles Hammond is good.",/review/rw4854100/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2019,spenserpollard,9," Haters Gona Hate
","Legitimately one of the best rom coms I have ever seen. This is coming from a person who sways with republicans. The performances are exceptional. Both Seth and Charlize are playing their strong suits. And hooyah was it awesome to see such very different actors get a chance to be on screen together. The witty and even sometimes scary realistic nature of the writing in this film gave me chills. Yes, the stoner guy who was incredibly intelligent, honest, and wasn't afraid to stand for what he believes in...Guess what? Makes the SECRETARY OF STATE who possesses the same qualities fall for him. It isn't about oh look at the nerdy guy get the pretty girl. NO?!!! This is simply a man and woman who find one another and fill in the gaps in their own lives. I thought it executed the political climate in our country beautifully and fairly. One of the most ground breaking scenes I have ever seen in a hollywood film. All in all if you're super liberal or super conservative, you'll hate it and won't be able to take it for the true love story that it is. But if you are the person that is truly able to talk and break down barriers, this is a story for the ages and one that I hope will play on and on. Can't believe they were able to pull off this in a rom com. Funny as hell, pure of heart, Brilliant.",/review/rw4854100/?ref_=tt_urv

18 July 2019,MovieIQTest,," Seth Rogen is not qualified for anything
","This movie is just too absurd to review. Seth Rogen's exaggerations and completely unbelievably pretentious performance only made it worse than an average bad farce. This is not a comedy or dramedy, it's garbage not even worth recycling. He played a role so annoying, so dirty and so shallow. A ridiculous screenplay, so ridiculous that pained me to see Charlize Theron would accept to play a role and having sex with this dirty, crazy, non-talent yo-yo, it just made me sick. This pathetic movie wasted a lot of budget on so many localities with so many manpower for what? Nothing. Terrible scenarios, plots, dialog, supporting actors around this guy only made it become on of the worst movies in motion picture history. Rating over 7? There obviously got lot of viewers and reviewers as silly and annoying like Seth Rogen. I didn't finish it, just bailed out after 40 painful minutes. Rogen is a poisonous element, only making Hollywood look even pathetic.",/review/rw4854100/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2020,imseeg,3," NOT really funny. Nowhere near credible. I mean, Charlize Theron falling in love with Seth Rogen? Who can believe such ridiculous nonsense? You can? Go watch it then...
","The bad: this is a politically correct story about politics. Trump fans probably wont like it (because a Trump lookalike gets ridiculed constantly) and although Trump haters could like this story, even they will have to deal with many TEDIOUS politically correct themes, which simply aint good material for making jokes.",/review/rw4854100/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2019,bopdog,1," Disgracefull rip-off. BAD. Also seems studio PR stooges stuffed the ratings - not cool
","This movie was so bad it was a disgrace. No single character was endearing or likeable. No pairings of characters were in the least ""real"" (movies are fake, of course, but good ones, even silly ones, FEEL authentic). Not a single plot point made sense, or was in the least bit relatable to the audience (or at not to least me, anyway).",/review/rw4854100/?ref_=tt_urv

","As a life-long Democrat, one must concede that there are those among us who are so smug in their contempt for the ""other side,"" that they lose sight of a crucial political dictum: respect your opponents (even if you don't agree with them).

14 May 2019,Danusha_Goska,2," Lousy Script, Obnoxious Character, Zero Chemistry
","2019's ""Long Shot"" starring Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron is an attempt at a romantic comedy crossed with a gross-out schlub movie. Average guy Fred Flarsky meets and falls in love with presidential candidate Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron). We've seen similar movies before, like ""The American President"" with Michael Douglas and Annette Benning, and ""Dave"" with Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver. Those movies were mildly pleasant. ""Long Shot"" is wretched.",/review/rw4854100/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2019,UniqueParticle,9," Made me smile, which should be good enough
",Seth Rogen as always a silly party animal with a bit more wits this time around and Charlize Theron a political comedy genius in my opinion. Nice charismatic endearing romantic comedy cleverly written & a ridiculous amount of profanity/crudeness! Solid fun time. Jonathan Levine's films are fairly enjoyable.
