2 September 2019,Sleepin_Dragon,8," It doesn't get much love, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.
","This kept reminding me of A Christmas Carol, with the central figure visited by three ghosts, our central figure, namely Will Smith, is visited by three beings, all sent, to turn his life around.",/review/rw3820443/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2020,dragoncherie,10," A beautiful film
","I wanted to see this movie And I finally did. I was outvoted to see it when it first came out due to it's bad reviews. I can say now with full certainty, that I can not fathom why those reviews even exist. This is not a perfect movie, but everything it does it does well and with grace. The personification of these abstract things, love, death and time show how sometimes we need to confront and see these things for what they are: a part of life. it is because of death that our time should be spent on love...yes I cried repeatedly.and please like I always say if you had it on your list watch it now and just decide for yourself.",/review/rw3820443/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2017,jasonperronesr,9," Critics need to get a life
","Negative reviews kept me out of the theater. Thankfully my mom talked me into watching this. What a beautiful, heartbreaking, well written nearly perfect movie. And the soundtrack is gorgeous and rips your heart out. There is nothing negative to be said. The performances are splendid across the board.",/review/rw3820443/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2016,easkeen,9," I'm glad I didn't listen to negative reviews....
","Because I really liked this movie. Its a drama...and it was slow to unfold but the message was beautiful. It makes you sad, angry, question...but in the end you learn that ALL those emotions are life and love and I thought the performances portrayed that perfectly. I think you either get that message or you don't. The acting was phenomenal including some real surprise performances. Don't go in expecting cheesy happy ""Christmas miracle"" endings. Don't expect a block-buster big bang edge of your seat thriller....expect a beautiful film that is taking a difficult topic(s) and turning it into a thing of beauty.",/review/rw3820443/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2020,williamalantz,10," One of the most underrated movies of all time
","Yes, the story can feel a little sappy, but I think the cast does really well with what they are given. The story is sweet and we watch it at home every Christmas time",/review/rw3820443/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2017,Alanrad,10," Did I see the same Collateral Beauty movie?
","My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. Unlike some of the reviewers. I thought the acting was excellent, the story asked some questions, the theatre audience chuckled in the right places and people were carrying their tissues as they left the movie. So I guess for audiences (at least the audience I watched this with) - a success. Of course this more sensitive category of movie lays itself open for cynicism and I would not go to see this with a bunch of mates, but with this type of movie I try to sit back and let it gently flow. And it flowed nicely for my wife and I. And we were rewarded with what we thought was an excellent, satisfying ending. If Need For Speed is your favorite franchise this is not for you. But I would give it a chance if I were you, it's a better movie that some of the other reviewers claim but get the tissues ready.",/review/rw3820443/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2017,subxerogravity,7," Think this could be a Christmas Classic, someday.
","So I read somewhere that Collateral Beauty does not have what it takes  to be a Christmas Classic. I'm not sure about that, you be surprise how  many Christmas Classic don't have what it takes to be Christmas  Classics.   It took a While for It's a Wonderful Life to become an X-mas Classic  Smith plays a man who is shocked to the core with the lost of his  daughter and can't do anything else, but in an attempt to wrap his head  around it he starts writing letters to Time, Love, and Death and things  get crazy when they respond to these letters.  I think we were all expecting something more form big Willie and he did  not deliver. They can't all be magical ones, but we were expecting pure  magic.  I got to admit though, this movie should have been magic not just  because of the Fresh Prince. He lead a very stellar cast of fine as  wine actors. With such power houses at Ed Norton, Kate Winslet and  Helen Mirren leading the charge   So it's not a bad movie at all, possibly not as good as the cast that's  in it, you'd expect more but you never known sometime down the line  this could be a new Christmas Classic. Let's see how many people stream  it on Netflix.",/review/rw3820443/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2017,TheLittleSongbird,5," Hardly an ugly duckling, lacking in too many areas to be considered a beauty
","'Collateral Beauty' is one of those films that was critically derided, critical reception was not kind to it, but has garnered a more polarising reaction from people commenting on this site.",/review/rw3820443/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2017,WhimsicalVonia,6," Cheesy & Quotable. Works For Me.
","Cheesy, clich√©, contrived, overdone? Yes, yes, yes, and yes. I know it, but I still loved it. Liked the twist. Loved the quotable quotes. Serious matters addressed, but the comic relief was there. Without Will Smith, I probably would have given this an 8. A 7/10. To me, this is a great film that I would watch many times again. ""I thought you couldn't afford therapy anymore."" ""I can't. It was my Uber driver."" ""Wait. They have a CSI Cleveland now?"" ""Be sure to notice the collateral beauty. It is the profound connection to everything."" ""You lived right, my friend. But you are not dying right."" "" I realized that I was not feeling love. I had become love."" Fascinating to learn the actual statistic that 79% of couples divorce after losing a child. Makes sense. My favorite: ""I am love. I am the fabric of life. I am the only 'why'... I was there in her laugh but I am also here now in your pain. Do not try to live without me.""",/review/rw3820443/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2017,michellesalter,9," A great film with a fantastic cast
",Yet another occasion that I'm glad I didn't listen to the critics. This film had everything in it for me and Will Smith once again showed what a fantastic actor he truly is. It has a great cast of award nominees (including Dame Helen Mirren) who make this film a real roller-coaster of emotions. Each actor having their own unique part to play giving the film great depth. This is my first ever review on IMDb and it's because I enjoyed the film so much and I believe the critics got it so very wrong on this occasion! I felt I had to stand behind the film and great actors to prove this is not the underdog of films but can stand side by side with many great films.,/review/rw3820443/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2016,wisal-albulushi,8," Every tragedy is accompanied with beauty...
","Every tragedy is accompanied by beauty. However, as we are steeped in grief and sorrow, we tend to overlook the beauty that is caused by the tragedy. The term ""collateral"" is often followed by the term ""damage"". It is so familiar to keep an eye on the collateral damage of anything we do. We don't tend to look for beauty. This movie is so deep, and it is one of those type of movies that make you think! It illustrates the three big why's that drives us; love, death, and time. These three constructs are not absolute; they are not fixed and they don't diminish. They are so sensitive to things, events, and people surrounding us. They change forms, and accordingly change our lives. In the midst of all the tragedies you face during your life, all the bitterness, keep an eye on the collateral beauty.",/review/rw3820443/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2016,Chris12985,10," Emotional from start to end... worth every moment in it.
","I'm going to keep this short since there are already so many other great reviews here to read... to sum it up though, this is a Very well put together film, with Many great elements, some of which are Very unexpected. I usually HATE dramas, and am more of a fun action / suspense / adventure kind of film guy... but every so often, a film such as this comes out, and its one that someone can easily break their usual style and enjoy.",/review/rw3820443/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2018,neil-476,8," Much to recommend it
","Howard (Will Smith) is a high-powered and committed ad executive, driven by the interaction between Love, Time and Death. When his daughter dies, there is nothing left in Howard's life. He writes letters to Love, Time and Death, but doesn't function at work any more, leaving his three partners at a loss as to how to save the business crashing. When Death, Time and Love turn up in person and respond to Howard's letters, will this provide him with a way out of his grief?",/review/rw3820443/?ref_=tt_urv

","Beautifully portrayed movie about love, hope and life. These critics are unbelievable and useless. These meta scores on IMDb are dumb and useless. Its just 1 useless person doing the review job and he does not represent the entire world audience. Ignore these critics. Movie is emotionally brilliant and strong. A brilliant movie about life told in a emotionally satisfying way. The film is so pleasant to watch which portrays human emotions in a wonderful way. ",/review/rw3820443/?ref_=tt_urv

26 February 2017,yoyo_hamblen,10," It's on point in all the right places
","We need a movie like this from time to time. It's written so well. I wish I had read the book first. These movies help is to take a step off the fast wheel and just take a moment to think. I think the movie demonstrates a certain feeling that we all become quite numb in our lives. Numb to other people's feelings, numb to our own needs and numb to our pain and to the needs of others. It doesn't surprise me that someone would write a dreadful review about this movie. I ask for what motive? Movies are not for everyone. There are many movies that I don't like but I don't feel compelled to scrutinise what was bad or wrong about it. ",/review/rw3820443/?ref_=tt_urv

","Not terrible. Just OK, but nothing special. I could see that there was a nice message in there somewhere, it just ends up being a bit mixed. It is kind of harmless for the most part though. So I can see this being an OK travel film or something like that.",/review/rw3820443/?ref_=tt_urv

1 October 2017,archyros-30909,10," An Amazing Film
","The story is deep. The acting is amazing. There are so many great moments. And if I watch it again, I may cry. Will Smith shows what it is like to lose a child, and how his life has ground to a halt. He lives every day, but he cannot move forward. Until his friends decide to try to prove that he is too upset with life to be allowed to continue to run his ad agency into the ground. Their brilliant idea is to hire three actors to portray Love, Time and Death, because he has been writing letters to those cosmic concepts as if they are persons. Their intention is to capture video of him arguing with those entities to show that he is out of his mind. But he, along with his friends, gets help from those entities. Excellent writing, great scenes, I just finished watching it, and I have to go now. All I can say is Goodbye!",/review/rw3820443/?ref_=tt_urv
