28 October 2011,Rockwell_Cronenberg,9," Six years later, it hits even harder.
","I've always admired this film to a certain extent, but I think the thing that always kept me from loving it was that it never resonated with me emotionally. I would get attached while watching it, but all of those feelings would leave me fairly soon afterward. It had been about five years since I'd seen the film, and in that time I have grown up a lot, fallen in love, had my heart ripped to shreds and fallen back in love again and I think this growth personally has really opened me up to a place in my mind and heart to embrace this film more than most other screen romances that exist. Almost immediately it hit me harder than it had before and after a day since I watched it, the pain and heartache I experienced during it still remains at my core.",/review/rw1964409/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2007,blanbrn,10," Unpredictable and uncommon love that last the times, and remains even when it ends in tragedy.
","This for sure is not your typical cowboys story as it may seem when it starts out, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is something much more special. Starting out in 1963 in rural Wyoming a simple summer friendship is formed by two innocent cowboys by the name of Ennis Del Mar(Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist(Jake Gyllenhaal) only this summer encounter will turn into a lifelong connection of love and friendship. After the summer course of work ends, both return back to their old grounds and each begin new directions. Jack returns to Texas to enjoy the life of a rodeo cowboy and falls in love and marries a sexy and wealthy female(Anne Hathaway) and he begins a family. Ennis stays in Wyoming and marries his old school love(Michelle Williams) and a family of children begins right away, and Ennis has to continue to work hard as a ranch hand. Ennis then four years into his normal world receives a postcard, then him and Jack revisit and again start to have wonderful encounters every so often at Brokeback, this finally costs Ennis his wife. Anyway this strong bond continues year after year as each man goes along with the changes joys and heartbreaks so commonly associated with everyday life. When tragedy strikes and Ennis finds out about the fate of Jack, the emotional love lasts and you get an emotional feel at the tribute that Ennis gives to Jack at the end. I must say great movie and well done especially good acting from Ledger and Gyllenhaal who make both Ennis and Jack such likable characters that you feel emotions for and you feel their hurt. Also way to go for director Ang Lee for having the courage to take on the topic of gay cowboy love, especially the way he directed in the setting of a conservative Wyoming in the 1960's. Lee really proved that love is possible for anyone and that any human being can love another human being no matter who they are.",/review/rw1964409/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2006,nycritic,10," Finally A Film Which Gets it Right
","It was only time before a film about two men in love would get the treatment it gets in Ang Lee's BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, since up to now, films had either skirted the subject, reduced it to a peripheral, sanitized version of itself or given it the eye-candy treatment only meant at making a quick impression in the ""Gay-Lesbian"" category. The simple yet deceptive story of two people who meet, fall in love, but are unable to fulfill their love has been done over and over again from the male-female perspective (i. e. IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE, THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, BRIEF ENCOUNTER), but never involving two men, and never this brutally honest.",/review/rw1964409/?ref_=tt_urv

","The 2006 Best Picture Oscar was contested, primarily, by two 'issue' pictures  one dealing with race, the other dealing with homosexuality.

11 February 2006,nobbytatoes,10," a rare gem
","In 1963, two strangers, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist are looking for work. Both find work herding sheep for Joe Aguirre on Brokeback Mountain. Both men are completely different from each other, Ennis is extremely introverted and emotionally isolated, not connecting to others through his mumbled words. Jack is open and self confident, with inspirations of glory on the rodeo scene. Over the days stuck in the isolated mountain range, their friendship makes a strong connection between them, soon becoming a highly intimate and emotionally charged relationship. When the season is over, returning to humanity, they both go their separate ways. Ennis marries his fiancé Alma and have two girls, while Jack tries the rodeo with little success, though soon meets Lureen both marrying with a baby boy soon to follow.",/review/rw1964409/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2005,marcosaguado,10," The Heart Of The Matter
","I didn't believe for a moment that the film could live up to the hype, or to some of the comments posted here, some of them read like love letters to the film, to the director and the actors. Well, now, after seeing the film, I feel like writing a love letter myself. The film took over my senses and transported me. The tragedy that envelopes the lives of Ennis and Jack is caused by an ancestral ignorance that is part of our DNA and if you don't believe me read some of the hateful comments posted here alongside the love letters. That's the heart of the matter. After the summer in Brokeback Mountain, Ennis and Jack go their separate ways and Ennis hits a wall with his fists crying, trying to destroy his longing, self loathing, guilt, horror. Imagine in a world without ignorance and therefore without hatred, Ennis and Jack could have celebrated their love and attempt an honest life together. Imagine also if things were the other way and heterosexuals were the dark minority, imagine falling in love with a girl and having to keep it secret, never been able to tell or to show publicly your love for her. Men like Ennis, and there are many, have to curve their own emotions and conform, entering and developing unhappy marriages and why? Read some of the comments here and you'll understand why. There is one that condemns the movie and what the movie may do for his kid and his vision of cowboys without actually having seen the movie! That's the heart of the matter. I will go and see the film again tomorrow, if I can get tickets, I'm taking with me a group of people that hate the movie already without having seen it. I won a bet so they will have to. I'm taking them to diner later to talk. I intend to report the results if you let me. But for the time being let me tell you, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is an extraordinary film. Jake Gyllenhaal, Ann Hathaway and the magnificent Michelle Williams give superb performances but it's Heath Ledger's film. He gives us something that nobody could possibly have expected because what he gives us is not only, honest and moving and powerful but totally and utterly new.",/review/rw1964409/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have just heard so much about ""Brokeback Mountain"", it is crazy. People were either excited to see it or protesting against it's homosexuality theme and all the awards this movie is going up for, the girls at my work and I had to see it and saw this movie last night. You know, I really liked it. I've said it before and I'll say it again, 2005 wasn't the best year for movies, and I'm not just saying this, but I felt that Star Wars, King Kong, and now Brokeback Mountain so far are the only real decent movies to see.",/review/rw1964409/?ref_=tt_urv

","Here's my challenge: Watch Casanova and Jarhead (both now showing in local theaters) before watching Brokeback Mountain, to appreciate and to keep fresh in your mind, the acting range of both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. One plays a king of lovemaking, while the other plays an army grunt, in which both are alpha-males roles. Then when you watch Brokeback Mountain, you'll probably be wide-eyed at how these two have a go at each other.",/review/rw1964409/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2007,Howlin Wolf,8," Things sure do change when you're up on 'Brokeback Mountain'...
","I have to say what really impressed me the most was the scope of it all. I expected it to focus by and large on the immediate aftermath of Jack and Ennis' first coupling, but to my welcome surprise the whole film had a real sweeping, epic quality to it. When the bond that they shared survives such change in their circumstances it made the whole tale that much more evocative. It shows that regardless of your gender or your approach to relationships, love is like a tick that gets under your skin and won't ever stop affecting your mental processes throughout all of your time on earth (and don't I know that that sure is the truth... !!)",/review/rw1964409/?ref_=tt_urv

1 July 2006,Phantasm01,10," A Masterpiece of Modern Cinema
","Spectacular! There are no words to describe just how moving and honest and real this film is. The bottom line here is a message that transcends all barriers; gay or straight, male or female, rich or poor. The message is that love comes in many forms and if you are ever lucky enough to find a love so deep and strong, you must hang onto it regardless of all other outside factors. And when you don't, you very well could end up with nothing just as Ennis DelMar does. This is not a gay cowboy movie. It is an honest look at love and how two people who have the world against them try to follow their hearts but succumb to the pressures of a society that doesn't understand that love must transcend all.",/review/rw1964409/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2007,Isaac5855,9," An Epic Cinematic Masterpiece
","BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a masterpiece of storytelling that takes some uncomfortable topics and situations and places them in the context of a moving and beautiful story. This is the story of Ennis Delmar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal), two cowboys whose isolated summer sheepherding assignment turns them from strangers to friends to lovers in the matter of couple of months. After their assignment is over they are separated for four years, in which time they both marry and have children. They are then reunited and it's like no time has passed at all. Unfortunately, Ennis' wife, Alma (Michelle Williams)witnesses their passionate reunion and chooses to live with the secret instead of confronting Ennis. What we then see is two people who seem to genuinely love each other, kept apart by circumstance. The word love never passes between Ennis and Jack. Ennis calls it ""this thing."" The men claim to be straight after their first encounter (though I have my doubts about Jack). The words ""gay"" or ""homosexual"" appear nowhere in the screenplay, though the word ""queer"" is used once. What we see more than the passion these men share when they're together is the passion they long for when they are apart. Ang Lee's sensitive and detailed Oscar-winning direction captures every nuance of emotion and passion between these two men without preaching to us or taking a stand on the underlying issues here. Ledger and Gyllenhaal give breathtaking, Oscar-worthy performances and receive solid support from Williams as Alma and Anne Hathaway as Jack's wife, Lorene. For me, this movie is above everything else, a love story, a beautiful, moving, emotionally charged love story where the protagonists just happen to be men.",/review/rw1964409/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have to admit, when I first heard this movie was getting made (December 2003, on Italian TV), I never thought I would see it, as the idea of watching a ""gay Western"" wasn't that appealing (actually, I wasn't a big fan of the Western genre in general back then, but that was before I saw Dances with Wolves and The Searchers). Then I heard it had won the Golden Lion in Venice, whereas everyone thought the award would go to Good Night, and Good Luck. And now it has won four Golden Globes and will most probably get this year's Best Picture Oscar. Yes, it is that good, and I don't regret I finally went to see it.",/review/rw1964409/?ref_=tt_urv
