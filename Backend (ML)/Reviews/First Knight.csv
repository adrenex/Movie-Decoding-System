21 January 2023,sinahaase-960-743497,5," Is this a Disney channel show
","This show's script and acting is very similar to that of a Disney channel show from the 2000's. Like wizards if waverly place sort of acting and humor. The only cool parts were of kelso, Eric, Donna, and Jackie. But since they're not the stars of the show and only cameos, the show is doomed. It's not funny like that 70's show...it's literally just like I said: a cheesy Disney channel show full of forced laughing. The scene with the beer drinking was super uncomfortable and I don't know why lol i know they drank and smoked weed in that 70's show but for some reason it didn't feel so weird like watching these kids drink and find weed. Maybe cuz they look so young? I dunno it just seemed different in an uncomfortable way. In that 70's show they don't want to let their parents catch them doing anything bad cuz they'll get in trouble and it was funny...but in this show, it just looks awkward like super young teens drinking and smoking and not caring at all if their parents see their cups of beer. It doesn't make sense. So Eric's daughter who looks 13-14 is drinking right in front of him and he gets mad for 2 seconds and then let's her stay the summer to drink n get high more? Very unlikely and not very funny. It's just not the same as the first show...not even a tiny bit similar. Like I said, it's like a show for 12 yr olds as far as humor but with drinking and smoking weed lol it makes no sense. Also, the Alanis Morsette song singing was sooooo cringe. The back n forth ""bro"" also cringe. No one said that back then.",/review/rw8811866/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,Airman87,6," Who is this for, Gen Z or fans of the old? Both dislike it.
","I cannot decide who this show is for, Gen Z or fans of the original That '70s Show? The writing almost feels like a Gen Z interpretation of what the 90's was like. A 14 year old girl going to a rave? I was a teenager in Miami in the 90's and 14 year olds did not go to raves. There is a lot of unrealistic modernization about this show, including a rebellious 15 year old feminist preaching pay gaps and a gay 15 year old who is ""out"" in rural Wisconsin. Despite the pandering, this show actually scores lowest with Gen Z reviewers. In fact, it is getting annihilated by the very demographic it feels like it is catered to.",/review/rw8811866/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2023,Saman91IT,," Not really 90s kids and overall not well-written (not fun!)

","3 episodes in, the kids are still anonymous, stereotypical, and their scenes are NOT very funny.",/review/rw8811866/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,markwha,6," Has its moments but weighted down by modernization
","So to state the obvious right away, the roles played by the original cast are great. In the original series they really captured lightening in a bottle and each member of the original cast who appeared in the show played their roles so well, it's hard to believe that it's been 2 and a half decades since they were originally cast.",/review/rw8811866/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,chunkylefunga,4," Misses the charm of the original

21 January 2023,ragboy12345-194-802090,7," Thankful for the original cast
",If it wasn't for the original cast cameos it wouldn't be worth watching. There are some good jokes from the new cast but they don't have that same connection that the original cast had. It seems like they're all still learning. The originals first season also felt that way but you could tell there was something there I don't feel that this new cast has that it factor.,/review/rw8811866/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2023,hnt_dnl,3," Not very funny
","This new Netflix series THAT 90S SHOW (2023-????) unsuccessfully tries to tell a continuation story to the insanely popular hit That 70s Show, which ran from 1998 to 2006. In my opinion, comedy is less subjective than drama. With drama, there can be a wide array of opinions on the quality and level of writing and acting. I've seen a lot of dramatic movies and shows deemed ""masterpieces"" that are actually bloated, overly serious, pretentious filler, in my opinion. I've seen the term ""slow burn"" used for stuff that's just plain slow filler. And I've seen people praise dramatic performances as ""great"" that I think are terrible. But dramas can fool a lot of people who think incessant yelling and crying and characters looking ""serious"" all the time is the same as great acting. But with comedy, it better be FUNNY. Genuine humor and laughs cannot be faked and if a show deemed a comedy is not funny, it's not going to fool a lot of people. And that is the main problem with That 90s Show. It is simply not funny. The bigger problem is that it has the far funnier and superior That 70s Show to compare it to, which is 2 strikes against it already. That 90s Show can't compete. Maybe if it were some new thing with no connections to the original series, it would fool more fans because there is a LOT of modern output that seems to get undeserved praise. But this show isn't fooling very many people.",/review/rw8811866/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,catarinakulborg,9," For some reason I really liked it
","I don't know if it's just pure nostalgia or if the show actually does reach a certain standard, but I binged this first season in one day and I found myself feeling all kinds of fun fluffy feelings. Plus, I actually laughed. Many times. At sitcom jokes. Yeah.",/review/rw8811866/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,Perezeric11,6," Gen Z trying to be 90s
","I don't think it's bad, the original characters are great as expected. The younger cast needs to spend time researching actual 90s angst because none of them have it. Also, mostly everyone looks like they're wearing costumes and not authentically living 90s. For the younger cast they should either recast, build their skills up, or introduce better characters. Even the comedic delivery doesn't hit, like I don't know if this is their first time but it comes off awkwardly. The best of the new cast is the mother neighbor, she's really good and confident in her role. I hope Netflix really tries to fix some of these things because if they don't I can't see this lasting more than two seasons.",/review/rw8811866/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,Tactrix,1," Crash n' Burn
","It's like the 70's show if it had bad writers, no talented actors, and was completely out of touch with reality. So let me clue in all the people who made ""the 90's show"". Couple million things you did wrong. You apparently did no research on what was popular in the 90s. You had no idea what to put in there, or even any concept of how to go about. But the worst thing you did was try to REBOOT a show that lived and died on things that actually happened and worked in the 70's.",/review/rw8811866/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,CrookedNose94,7," Left me wanting more... of the original cast
",I'll admit I was skeptical to watch this but I'm glad I did. I was a huge fan of the original series. Red and Kitty play a huge part in the series and that's what keeps me watching. Some of the other cameos were obviously much needed fan service and I'm happy to see some of those familiar favorites return.,/review/rw8811866/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,mistiqe,," Umm...
","This show has it all. Diversity, 15 years old strong feminists, Winnie the Pooh, canned laughs, walking ad for plastic surgeries gone wrong, bad actors and all the other typical Netflix things. What it doesn't have is soul, jokes or anything 90' related. I watched 5 episodes and haven't laughed once, not even a giggle. I gave the show 2 stars; 1 for Red and Kitty and 1 for old characters cameos, everything else isn't worth a star.",/review/rw8811866/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,dan_counts,8," A Good Continuation...
","I'm not sure where the hatred of this series is coming from. They didn't say it was a reboot, they've always marketed it as a continuation and it does that amazingly well.",/review/rw8811866/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2023,brandonneicke,6," These are definitely millennials
","These kids are nothing like 90s kids. It screams millennial. Jokes are bland for the most part, red is the exact same which I think is unrealistic and doesn't jive well with the age of his character now. Kitty Is the only fairly consistent thing in the show. Couple descent jokes and still nostalgic but damn what a sad reboot. The only time I actually laughed in the 3 episodes was when we saw Tommy Chong for 2 minutes. The kids are not great comedy actors and the writing is very weak. Storylines are also stupid. Did any of these kids even do research and watch that 70s show? Very disappointed but still worth throwing on when cooking a meal or something just to see some good familiar faces and hear the odd descent joke.",/review/rw8811866/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2023,timijan-tuparov,10," What's wrong with people nowadays? I loved it!
","I'm a 31 and I grew up watching That '70s Show. It's one of my favorite sitcoms of all times, I own all the seasons (yeah, even the eight one) and I rewatch it when I really want to just laugh while I'm doing a circle of my own with my husband.",/review/rw8811866/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,noelsfilm,7," They're figuring it out
","The new cast is still settling in. I'm not sure if they're still getting to know the characters or if the writers are trying to find them, but this new generation doesn't quite feel as defined or individualistic as the original cast. There's quite a bit of personality overlap with the characters.",/review/rw8811866/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,FeastMode,4," Take a great show and Netflixify it
","That '70s Show is one of my all-time favorites. I've seen it so many times that I basically have it memorized. I still watch it to this day. It was super edgy, boundary-pushing, and most importantly, hilarious.",/review/rw8811866/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,youngluke-32772,8," The return of sitcoms being funny
","This show was pretty good. Still getting used to the seasons only being 10 episodes when originally in this format there are between 20-24. Ever since the Big Bang theory ended the sitcom genre has kinda fallen off, but this was thoroughly enjoyable with not one stale joke anywhere. Not sure why so many people in these reviews are hating on it so much, the characters are just as likeable as the original cast and the show ended with me wanting to see so much more from this new cast. Also the jokes are pretty good too, I was pretty much laughing all the way through the show - count me invested for season 2, that is if Netflix decides to renew.",/review/rw8811866/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,kjproulx,6," Passable Because of the Original Cast
","Growing up watching reruns of That '70s Show and having watched the series all the way through a couple of times, I have to say I was at least a little excited to hear that most of the cast was returning for this sequel show, That '90s Show. I was pretty turned off after seeing the first promotional material for it. Nothing about it felt funny and I was worried the new teenagers wouldn't click nearly as well as the original cast did. After finishing season one of this new series, I'll say that's about half true. This season was all over the place for me in terms of humour. Here's why I believe this series is only worth a shot if you love That '70s Show.",/review/rw8811866/?ref_=tt_urv
