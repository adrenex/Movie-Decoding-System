24 September 2020,deloudelouvain,6," Not that bad but could have been better.
","Besides a couple inconsistencies in the story, just little things that made no sense, The Wretched is an entertaining movie in the ""witch"" genre. It isn't the best movie I ever watched in this genre but it's certainly worth a watch. The horror parts are well made and pretty decent in the ""gore"" genre. The acting was most of the time good, nothing to really complain about. That said it could all have been better but still there are a couple good creepy parts that will keep you attentive, and in a horror movie that's a bonus.",/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2020,ryan_sy,6," Not a Total Waste of Time, but Nothing Special
","This movie had the right pieces including a likeable protagonist, decent practical effects, and a brisk pace. But the plot felt ""forced"" by the end and it veered into an average movie. It lacked effective scares and a sense of dread that I like in a ""witch"" movie and the antagonist was not as frightening as I would have liked.",/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2020,kaefab,7," Lots of horror movies popping out but this one stands out
",I really like this movie its very well made the gore everything the witch is very mean and spares no one.,/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2020,heratyplant,7," Great Little 'Stumble-Upon' 100% Worth a Watch
","Obviously a lower/ smaller budget, but unlike others, it both looks & sounds excellent; there's obviously very competent production in all departments here.",/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2020,tresm87,8," A well executed practical effect focused throwback horror story, that delivers the disturbing imagery and a coming of age feel that older horror's had more of.
",The Wretched trailer caught my eye a few months back and i thought it looked very intriguing. I then saw it was also receiving some great reviews from people that were at fall festivals it was shown at. I have always been looking for a witch themed film like this but had always been let down by blown potential of past films which I'm sure everyone can guess what those obvious titles were...,/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2022,Stevieboy666,5," Certainly not wretched but not great either.
","Seventeen year old Ben goes to live with his Dad and gets a job at the marina where he works. He notices strange things going at his neighbours' house, the sexy mother - who looks like a Goth/rock chick - has become possessed by an evil witch who lives in the nearby forest. The Wretched is a teen movie meets Folk Horror and I think that the former is the stronger aspect. As a horror movie it throws in plenty of ""scares"", perhaps we see too much, a common fault with modern horror, personally I didn't find it scary at all. There are a few good special effects, one of the best has the witch emerging from a persons abdomen. Acting is good enough, Pipar Curda as Ben's sort of girlfriend Mallory being my favourite character. As modern horror movies go this isn't too shabby.",/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2020,kirbie2182,7," I liked it
","This movie is actually pretty good, unlike some of the other no-name horror movies popping up around the same time (1BR, The Lodge, The other lamb). This one is hardly original, but it's got a lot of throwbacks - 80's vibe, and is Well shot with above par FX, And convincing no-name actors). It's got it's own, not always welcoming, twist ending, which worked in this case for the better. It's really a pretty decent horror/comedy flick that doesn't take itself too seriously, looks good on screen, and keeps your attention throughout. I enjoyed it.",/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2020,TwistedContent,5," A Great Effort that Ends Up Being Fundamentally Basic
","I'm not sure was it the buzz going around before the release or what, but right off the bat I can say that, among other emotions, I'm also pretty disappointed. ""The Wretched"" is a reasonably well made horror movie, has all the typical makings of one - including a story that's pretty much put together of multiple familiarities, portions of ""Fright Night"", ""The Witch"", ""Rear Window"" (or ""Disturbia"", if You will), plus some body horror, and a kind of 80's feeling that seems to have stayed more of a goal than an achievement. Overall, ""The Wretched"" comes across as... fundamentally basic.",/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2020,paul_haakonsen,7," This was definitely a good horror movie...
","I had not heard about the 2019 horror movie titled ""The Wretched"" prior to stumbling upon it by sheer random luck. And being an avid horror fan, of course I picked up a copy and decided to sit down and watch it - even without knowing what the movie was about. The cover of the movie was more than sufficient to get my attention.",/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2020,dar0417,6," Solid witch film
",Didn't expect a lot but this was a solid low budget film with a good twist.,/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2019,mungflesh,6," Polished but muddled
","The Wretched is a lovely looking movie. Nicely acted and shot, with decent, practical special effects. I struggled with the story, which was ultimately a bit un-interesting.",/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2021,claudio_carvalho,4," Messy Supernatural Film
","""The Wretched"" is a supernatural film with a messy screenplay and story. The idea of a snoopy teenager that finds a witch that feeds of children and make people around forget them is interesting. The creepy special effects are excellent. Unfortunately, the development of the story and characters is poor and with lack of many explanations. My vote is four.",/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2020,Otkon,7," As a young adult horror story, it's decent.
",This is a fairly run-of-the-mill Goosebumps-style story. A fair assessment would be Fright Night mixed with Friedkin's The Guardian and a bit of Rear Window. The plot is not revolutionary by any means but there are some surprises including a nifty twist at the end involving one of the horror cliches that the film uses repeatedly to signify the presence of evil.,/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2020,queenofthedamned83,7," Great watch
","I really enjoyed this one, the plot is quite simple but intriguing and thoroughly engaging. The visual and sound effects were perfect and the acting was good. Nice little gem this one. Watch it with the lights out at night for added effect ðŸ˜‰",/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2020,jane-love,6," Great base story... just needed more character development.
",Almost there. I love a good scare. This one was a great concept. Missed the mark with no real character development. No build up. Needed to be drawn out .. more tense. enjoyed with the 14 year old teenagers that I watched with but for me .. i wanted to be scared but it never happened. 20% more and it would have been great.,/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2020,yogeshevolution,6," A mild but nice horror
",The movie is simple keeping horror basics with jump scares and witch tale. The story is good. Though the movie is predictable still it doesn't disappoint. The horror is mild and could have made more scary if attempted rightly.,/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2020,kingreido,7," Reminiscent of 80's horror
","I've been binging many of the classic 80's horror as well as cult classics and this film, The Wretched, gives me a similar feeling. It's your classic ""I think my neighbor is a ____"" with the mix of teen romance and family drama. It isn't an intellectual horror as this is a saturated genre, but it was fun to watch an updated version of the genre movies I love (fright night, the lost boys, etc). Like those films, they aren't perfect but they have there strengths as well as weaknesses. The creepiness was decent, but it was never very scary. It did a good job of slowly introducing the monster and building suspense. One thing I disliked was that the subplots failed to go below surface level so looking back they felt like a waste of energy - should have focused on only one along with the main story. However, the production was fantastic and you could tell they knew what they were doing. Actors were fine, but nothing to write home about.",/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2020,3epkk9b,6," Pretty fun actually
","Went in with no hope and it was surprisingly entertaining. Jump scares here and there, story and acting was convincing. Worth a watch.",/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2020,ks-60500,6," Typical horror but not bad
","It's a common horror story with some spiritual demon inside someone. From the neighbors observation and finding strange things had happened. This kind of theme is nothing new. But as the horror side is up to the level and make me feel not non sense, I kinda enjoy it.",/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2020,Leofwine_draca,4," Typical of its kind, and not good
","THE WRETCHED is another example of a low budget digital horror flick with a supernatural plotline. It's similar to many other stories with rural settings, focusing on small scale family drama for much of the running time and as such not being very interesting when it comes to holding the viewer's attention. The film is a little better shot than most and the supernatural elements of the plot, when they do finally emerge, bring to mind the likes of THE EVIL DEAD with a demon hiding inside the skin of a human. In the end, the lack of characters to truly care about sinks this one as it does so many others.",/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2020,Stoshie,4," Unsatisfying
","This was a strange movie (not in a good way) that left me empty. Too many loose ends not resolved, and an ending that, if you think about it, makes no sense. I don't like spoilers, but think about what the girl gave the boy at the end, and see if it is remotely logical that she would do that. I mean, the ending isn't original or unexpected, just poorly executed.",/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2020,advimrankhalid,5," Average Movie
",Was there something missing here or I did not enjoy it? I think the movie is good for audiences who just wanted a good watch (time pass) but not for the true horror fans. Something is missing with the movie it felt empty to me whole time I didn't realize that I am watching a horror movie because it didn't scared me at all. Recommended to those who wanted to watch a movie for good time pass.,/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2020,kirbylee70-599-526179,8," NOT SO NEIGHBORLY
",One of the few films to actually play on the big screen in the last few months makes its way to disc this week. Not so much indoor big screens but the drive-ins across the country that have opened allowing people to get out and enjoy a movie while at the same time practicing social distancing. It's only natural that the movie is a horror flick since those have been a staple of drive-ins since they began. Hopefully those screens allowed it to get completely dark before they began running THE WRETCHED.,/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2020,SnoopyStyle,6," compelling horror premise
","Teenager Ben Shaw comes to live with his father who is getting divorced to his mother. There is a creature, spirit, nature god, cult, or something nearby. Ben is concerned about the next door neighbor and their little boy. Something is wrong.",/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2020,nebk,7," Very Well Made
",The Wretched is a very well made horror movie. It's about a teenager called Ben who upon visiting his father during the summer becomes convinced that his next door neighbour has been replaced by a powerful witch who eats children. Getting anyone to believe him is not easy as she has the power to make people do her bidding and also to make them forget their loved ones who have disappeared.,/review/rw5696072/?ref_=tt_urv
