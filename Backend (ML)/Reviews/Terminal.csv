","Greetings again from the darkness. ""Who is Jean Seberg?"" A reporter asks the question to her, just before the movie star's agent escorts him away as she prepares for publicity shots on PAINT YOUR WAGON, the outlandish 1969 musical-comedy in which she co-starred with Clint Eastwood and Lee Marvin. It's also a question we expect a film entitled SEBERG to answer, though it never really does. Oh sure, we get the basics: small town girl (Marshalltown, Iowa), Hollywood starlet, activist, target of FBI, and tragic ending. Unwisely, the film tries to cram in too many other pieces of a puzzle - a puzzle plenty interesting on its own.",/review/rw5430862/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2020,ThomasDrufke,4," Real Life Story Deserved Better
","Jean Seberg's real life story is full of twists and turns and things that can be applied to things happening in 2020. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't separate itself from the pack and become anything fresh or original. And it feels like you can contribute some of the fault to the directing choices made by Benedict Andrews. The film never felt as engaging as the subject matter calls for. Seberg is deserving of a movie based on her life, but this certainly wasn't it.",/review/rw5430862/?ref_=tt_urv

8 September 2019,ArtistGrl,4," Mediocre at best
","It is sometimes hard to pinpoint where exactly films fail, the cinematography wasn't bad and you can definitely see that Kristen Stewart tried, but everything else about this film was below mediocre. Characters were one dimensional and lacked any depth, plot development, from the very moment the two main characters meet and then meet again, was abrupt and unbelievable. The other main characters - the good FBI agent vs. the bad one, were just as shallow. Not to mention the wives, whose role never went anywhere and might have as well not been in this film at all.",/review/rw5430862/?ref_=tt_urv

2 April 2020,phd_travel,7," Interesting for the persecution but K Stew feels very modern
",The best thing about the movie is how it shows the FBI persecuting a beautiful Hollywood actress because she supported the black panthers. It helps to be a fan of Jean Seberg. K Stew doesn't look like her or act or speak like her. K Stew is too fast and clipped in her speech and looks are very contemporary. But The good thing is the story is interesting and the other cast members are quite watchable including Jack O'Connor as an FBI agent with a conscience.,/review/rw5430862/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2020,Pairic,6," Could have been better
","Seberg: A film based on actual events in the life of Jean Seberg, star of Breathless and other French New Wave classics. Covering the period 1968 to 1971 it illustrates how the FBI destroyed her life through gaslighting tactics, false information and releasing tapes obtained through bugging. Seberg (Kristen Stewart) wasn't the only victim in this though, there was an element of revolutionary tourism involved in her support of the Black Panthers and the more reformist movement led by Hakim Jamal (Anthony Mackie). Jamal's marriage and educational trust were destroyed when details of his affair with Seberg were leaked by the FBI. What should have been a taut thriller turns out to be a disappointment due to the rather flat direction by Benedict Andrews, he doesn't deliver on the sharp script provided by Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse. The acting generally isn't bad but given the subject matter I would have expected more passion, especially from Stewart. 6/10.",/review/rw5430862/?ref_=tt_urv

","Seberg and BBC
Her interracial affair with Ahmed Hasni is more of a work of fiction in that it depicts a fictionalized account of her motives . Hollywood has always been a place where stars are managed into relationships that deliver the most media exposure. She ended up drawing the attention of the FBI and getting herself killed . When movies start telling the truth about such people ( Hollywood stars) that is the dark underbelly that drives their motivations we will one day be enlightened. For now this is another want to be actual tell all and social commentary which is neither truthful or relevant. ""The medium is the message""",/review/rw5430862/?ref_=tt_urv

4 June 2020,robinparker311,8," Very good but unnecessarily slightly inaccurate.
","I'm not sure I understand all the terrible reviews for this movie. People criticize Kristen Stewart for her part but I thought she played an excellent part. Unless the critics personally knew Jean Seberg, how could they say that Kristen Stewart did not portray her well?
I thought the story was compelling & surprisingly accurate (but not as much so as it could have been) although it could've actually been a better story if they were more accurate. According to the New York Times AND the FBI themselves (google it, the FBI admitted to ALL the wrongdoing in this movie & MUCH MORE), everything done to her by the FBI as portrayed in the movie is 100% accurate & then some. The FBI agent who is supposed to be 'sympathetic' toward the actress is inaccurate but I can understand the angle of having someone try to see her point of view.
What I truly don't understand is why the movie had the very very confusing storyline of her attempted suicide & then press release saying that her baby died at 2 days old, when the press release in the movie happened right after the attempted suicide & she was pregnant at the time. It made it look like the attempted suicide killed her child, but she was pregnant at the time so that was unnecessarily confusing when the actual truth is when the FBI reported falsely that she was pregnant w a Black Panther's child she went into premature labor, gave birth & the baby lived for three days. The movie could easily have use that as part of the story, making it far more interesting, accurate & much less confusing. I really enjoyed the film but was COMPLETELY confused as to why a baby who wasn't full term (or even close) was pronounced dead at 2 days old, during a press conference that took place what after a suicide attempt.
That's my only criticism of the movie.
Otherwise I found it compelling (I'm reading EVERYTHING I can on the actress now & was already familiar w her story), well made & the portrayal if Jean Segel SEEMED to me to be good, although I'm a bit too young to have seen much of her in the press in the 1960s & 70s.",/review/rw5430862/?ref_=tt_urv

28 June 2020,shoretalk,7," A Reminder
","There are moments in time when we need to be reminded of the wrongs we've inflicted on others. Seberg succeeds in bringing a message to even the most casual of viewers of what we've allowed to happen in our nation. I found the film to be well written and Kristen Stewart's portrayal of Seberg left me saddened and angry, which to me speaks to a film's success when dealing with news worthy topic. I wish the rest of the cast would have come close to Stewart's performance because it wouldn't have taken much to elevate this movie even more.",/review/rw5430862/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2020,st-shot,3," Simple Seberg lacks life.
","The FBI plays hardball with Jean Seberg while Kristin Stewart's portrayal hardens the softness of the former movie star in this bio that only partially covers her life. Covering the bureau's investigation period of her which director Benedict Andrews infers more than led to her blacklisting, miscarriage, divorce, emotional breakdown and eventual suicide, it gives the limited Stewart plenty to pout about, but little to dig into.",/review/rw5430862/?ref_=tt_urv

","I don't need to review the whole story of Jean Seberg, or this film, which is well done.. Other reviews and sources do that. This film touches on several aspects of her career, just enough to give us a sense of who she was and how her support of the Black movement in the US was her undoing. And how the FBI was unjust in using her to discredit that black movement.. All that aside, Kristen Stewart is the real deal.

11 January 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," Trial by fire.
","'Seberg (2019)' tells the true story of actress Jean Seberg's harassment at the hands of the FBI after she establishes ties to varying civil rights movements. Regardless of its accuracy (which I can't really comment on), the film has its finger on the pulse of modern day America, feeling incredibly resonant despite being set fifty years ago. As the FBI continue to unjustly push her, the protagonist descends into paranoia. It's frustrating, upsetting and affecting. The flick does play into 'biopic' tropes, though, even it feels more focused than a lot of similar fare. It's usually what you'd expect from such a story. Still, it's an engaging experience that remains compelling throughout. Its acting is great across the board and its cinematography is stunning. It gets its message across rather well, hitting home harder than you may anticipate. However, its narrative doesn't quite feel finished because it doesn't really have an obvious crescendo and most of its denouement is done via on-screen text. Again, this is very typical of the 'biopic' genre. Another issue is that the piece splits its time between two lead roles, Seberg herself and an increasingly disillusioned FBI agent. The latter is most likely a 'made-up' addition for the film, as he serves primarily to let us see how the FBI does what it does and to give a principle character an obvious arc. Indeed, he seems to change more than the protagonist herself, which is perhaps because he isn't beholden to 'real life', and he often feels like the flick's true focus. Ultimately, the balance between the two characters works well enough to not be all that detrimental to the affair's overall effect. It's worth mentioning, though, because it probably could have been handled a little better. As could the fact that we're essentially witnessing governmental racism through a white lens. Thankfully, the piece makes a point of pointing this out. It also has several major black characters who are treated wholly as 'good guys'. Overall, the picture is an engaging, entertaining and frustrating experience that immerses you in an unfair situation. It has its issues and it's almost generic, but it's typically well-done and consistently compelling. 7/10",/review/rw5430862/?ref_=tt_urv

28 May 2020,fleck05IMDB,3," Trust The Regular People Reviews
","Why would critics at the New York Times and Hollywood Reporter give an obviously bad movie such high marks? This movie (supposedly a biopic) centers around Seberg's fight with the FBI, for American civil rights and her inter-racial relationship. Most professional critics rate films on their diverse cast and theme over the thing that should matter most: Story.",/review/rw5430862/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2020,fullerdav,7," Flawed but worth seeing.
","Having read some of the poor reviews for this movie I went with low expectations. The movie is flawed but it is not nearly as poor as some of the reviews would have us believe. The movie started out with St. Joan, directed in 1957 by Otto Preminger, a movie that left her scarred both mentally and physically. However it did nothing to explain her popularity in France or her work with Goddard. That, I think should be essential in any movie about Seberg.
Next problem off course is the movies coverage of the FBI surveillance. Why it had to invent a sympathetic FBI agent is hard to understand.
Which brings me to why this movie is worth seeing. Kristen Stewart gives an outstanding central performance as Seberg. Forget that she does not look like her. A lookalike doing a Seberg impersonation would have been a disaster. This will be recognized in time as one of the performances of her career.
The supporting cast are all fine. Go and see it for yourself and don't let the reviews put you off.",/review/rw5430862/?ref_=tt_urv
