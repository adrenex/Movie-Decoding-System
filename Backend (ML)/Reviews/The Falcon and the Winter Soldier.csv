22 August 2021,ThomDerd,6," Excuzzz me, what's the bad guy's plan again?
","Banderas is now Greek. And wants to wreck havoc in the EU. Although the movie was (at times) fun and it's cool to see Samuel Jackson and Morgan Freeman in the same film, a star-packed cast can't get this film rated above 6. And 6 is already too much.",/review/rw7207957/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2021,dudewholikesthepits,5," EH
","I liked the first film I felt the chemistry between the leads was excellent. They played off of each other very well. This film has reduced Reynold's character to a version of every Tracy Morgan character. Whiney. Moronic. Irritating. I don't remember his character as such in the first film (perhaps I've just forgotten?). The addition of Banderas and Freeman were a nice touch, but they were under utilized to the point that there was no connection to them. The plot is weak and never really feels like it delivers on the ""thriller"" aspect. It was ok, but I'm glad it was a Redbox rental.",/review/rw7207957/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2021,Floated2,3," Falls short of the original
","Having not completely enjoyed the original but there was a much lite fluid approach and entertaining factor along with subtle humor. This sequel, things are far more over the top, repetitive and the plot is predictable and at times confusing. It isn't nearly as fun as the original. The box office of the original was seemingly a fluke and in the end this sequel wasn't exactly necessary.",/review/rw7207957/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2021,Top_Dawg_Critic,10," I can't wait for the ""Hitman's Wife's Neighbor's Best Friend's Uncle's Bodyguard"" next!
","The way the critics slammed this one, I was prepared for disappointment, especially considering how much I enjoyed the first one, and gave that one a 9/10. Well, two words for this one: Fkn Awesome!",/review/rw7207957/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2021,sbweightman,2," A mess of a movie which relies too heavily on the type-cast A-Listers to make it entertaining.
","It's basically a compilation of overly loud, gory and explosive action scenes interspersed with characters shouting and swearing at each other in the name of plot progression and comedy. The plot and humour is dumb, although it is funny at times, but the slapstick style and poor casting choices make this a bad film.",/review/rw7207957/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2021,paul_haakonsen,5," Essentially it went as most sequels tend to go...
","I did thoroughly enjoy the 2017 movie ""The Hitman's Bodyguard"", so when I saw that there was a sequel coming out and seeing that they vastly improved on the cast, I must admit that I was thrilled to get to sit down and watch the 2021 movie ""The Hitman's Bodyguard"".",/review/rw7207957/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2021,the_real_smile,1," A huge mess
","Below par movie, acting mediocre, effects good, story very very bad, could not make heads or tales of it. The story is not funny, very confusing, the characters not likable, why did they make this movie?",/review/rw7207957/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2021,Prismark10,4," Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
",The main plot of Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard dates from the global financial crisis of 2008. Since then there has been another kind of global crisis altogether.,/review/rw7207957/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2021,NestorTheGreat,5," When sociopath met psychopath.
","Akin to a paint-by-numbers redo of a favourite, but with all the wrong tools, colours and unneccessary added effects: namely Banderas and Freeman! I once wrote Ryan Renolds could do no wrong, and boy was I wrong!",/review/rw7207957/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2021,TxMike,," Good if you like profanity, gunfights, and gore.
","My wife and I settled into a nice evening looking for light, funny entertainment, so we spun up this BluRay disc from our public library. We got almost halfway when I hit 'pause' and asked, ""Are you enjoying this movie?"" She wasn't and I had only gone that far because she was still in the room.",/review/rw7207957/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2021,drjgardner,2," Better than Awful
","This isn't the worst film ever made, nor even the worst film in this century, but... Half the film consists of the actors' doubles, which normally would be offensive, but in this case, each of the principal actors does such an awful job that it's as relief not to have to look at their pathetic acting. Yes, some actors are worse than others, but they are all bad. Really bad. ""Bad"" as if you should use clips from this film in an ac ting class. But why pick on the actors? The script is awful. The photography is mediocre and the music is inoffensive. Also, so much of this garbage is filmed on sets it should be an embaressment to the producers. Like I said in the title, better than awful, but only a little.",/review/rw7207957/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2021,jakemaidment,7," Don't understand the hate?
","Been flicking through a load of the reviews on here and I seriously don't understand the hate. It's just a fun movie, just as crazy as the first one. It doesn't take itself too seriously, the jokes are funny and the action is great. What do you expect from this film? If you want to go and watch a fun, action packed film for an afternoon, go and check it out! If you're expecting some sort of classic, super high budget mind blowing phenomenon, go watch Avatar again or something.",/review/rw7207957/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2021,nancyldraper,4," Disappointing
","I went to see this movie expecting it to be a fun romp like its predecessor THE HITMAN'S BODYGUARD (which I rated a 7). This was a huge disappointment dispute the quality cast added to this sequel. The character's had lost their chemistry, the dialogue was purposefully crass, the plot was barely a sketch. Yes, lots of things got blown up, shot up or destroyed but there was no heart. I'm disappointed with this first movie since the theatre reopened after the COVID lockdown. I give this film a 4 (poor) out of 10. {Action Adventure}",/review/rw7207957/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2021,brandonmckay8,8," An incredibly awesome sequel!
","That's how you do a sequel. The movie doesn't stop. It's non stop action, comedy & all around brilliance with the perfect cast. If you loved the first I think you'd love the second. So many movie/people references that hit just right & it's constantly giving off laughs in between the seriousness. The ending had the whole cinema laughing & make sure you stay for the credit scene. Truly enjoyable!",/review/rw7207957/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2021,SnoopyStyle,6," Salma takes center stage
",Bodyguard Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds) is haunted from losing a client to hitman Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson). He lost his credentials in the aftermath. He's taking a sabbatical from violence and guns. He's kidnapped by Darius' wife Sonia (Salma Hayek) to join her in rescuing Darius. Then the trio gets kidnapped by Interpol to stop supervillain Aristotle Papdopolous (Antonio Banderas).,/review/rw7207957/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2021,arungeorge13,4," The kind of sequel that exists because the original made money! [+44%]
","No one really expects a solid plot from a film that's titled Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard, but what we do anticipate is a series of running gags coupled with silly-but-fun action set-pieces. The film - starring Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L Jackson, Salma Hayek, Morgan Freeman, Antonio Banderas, and Frank Grillo - is the sequel (to The Hitman's Bodyguard) nobody asked for but also the kind Hollywood frequently keeps gifting us. To sum it up, it is cut from the same cloth as its predecessor. We have a save-the-continent plot that involves flushing out a device from the baddies' clutches. This time around, Sonia Kincaid, (Hayek) the wife of Darius Kincaid (Jackson), carries more weight in the screenplay. Her presence, while always refreshing, adds little in the form of humour. It takes two to tango, but three is a tangle, they say.",/review/rw7207957/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2021,cdcrb,5," better the first time
","Remove the ""f"" bombs and you lose half the dialogue. Remove the shooting and, well, not much is left. Lots more of salma this time, tho. I think some of this was meant to be funny. I heard no laughs in the audience. Skip it.",/review/rw7207957/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2021,Crankgorilla,3," High end three
","A goofy ridiculous ride that leaves me feeling like I just had my wallet and 20 IQ points stolen, and maybe a kidney. Just awful good fun. But it comes with a hangover, and child support payments.... And perhaps leprosy.",/review/rw7207957/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2021,Gordon-11,," Very entertaining
","I thought this film was very entertaining. It is action packed, and has lots of very funny jokes. I enjoyed it a lot.",/review/rw7207957/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2021,Movie_Reviews,1," This is a turd of a movie
","Insanely bad, dominated by a Salma Hayek that runs around totally frantic, screaming obscenities as if to compensate for her lost youth. I cannot mention anything that was good, sorry. Do not recommend and Salma Hayek has obviously reached the end of her career. Bye bye!",/review/rw7207957/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2021,deloudelouvain,8," A good sequel to The Hitman's Boduguard, even better in my opinion.
","I watched both movies in a row, enjoyed both of them, but for once I think the sequel was even better than the first one. And that's all because of the much bigger role for Salma Hayek. She has a funny brutal character and that fitted the story perfectly. Foul language for sure but who really cares? I thought those were the best parts of the movie. Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson are again great playing together, a great mix of love/hate with some good funny lines. Great actions scenes as well, again a bit exaggerated but again who cares? It's just what you get in this genre so if you don't like that kind of action just skip it. The CGI's were this time a bit better than in The Hitman's Bodyguard. I wouldn't mind another movie with this trio to be honest. If it's that good again I'll look forward to it.",/review/rw7207957/?ref_=tt_urv

8 August 2021,carlos-pires,1," Depressingly ridiculous at every minute
