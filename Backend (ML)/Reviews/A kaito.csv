20 June 2014,robin_should,9," One ""depressing"" show worth watching
","OK I have read the other reviews and agree that this show can be depressing. I'm not even sure why I started to watch this but I then discovered each of the characters had their own crosses to bear, whether self-inflicted or through a series of circumstances and events, they all fight the daily fight of life, and the fight to stay alive in their jobs, stay faithful to friends and just do the right thing. The storyline makes this really hard and that's what makes this show so compelling. The actors are good, the script more realistic than most other police shows because people in real life have personal problems and jobs to cope with at the same time. I know this is set in Monteal and was a show in french first but my french is so rusty I would have given up after a few minutes, so, thank you for letting us poor English speakers into the world of 19-2.",/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2018,E Canuck,8," A STAND-OUT SERIES
","Commencing season 4 via Crave TV, I've really been enjoying this series. I think the casting is superlative, acting excellent and most of the writing is very credible, I'm less inclined to nit-pick this series than many I've watched, especially Canadian ones. I've a Quebecois friend who tells me the French series on which this is based was much stronger. If true, the Francophone original must have been really special. I'm going to be watching for a change in tone in this final season with its switch to CTV from Bravo. Already, in the first episode I think I might be seeing a bit of a change in tone, perhaps less credible action on the part of at least one of the characters, and one improbable action event.
That might reflect my prejudices about these networks, though. I miss Bravo network which we used to get before the cable service for our building was changed to a different provider. Another series that took a distinct nosedive switching to another network from its Bravo originator is Inspector Murdoch. Under CBC's watch the whole thing seemed to change emphasis to splashy production values and writing stereotypes. The main character Murdoch is awfully prettified.",/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2014,StevenR-64,8," Not a typical ""cop"" show.
","I've never seen the original french series, so I can't speak to how it compares to that, but I can say that it holds up on it's own as a great drama series.",/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2016,jonmccann,10," Southland...With sympathy!
","It is hard for 'smaller' TV stations to get on the global TV series map, but Canadian TV has been having a good stab it for a few years, 19-2 brings home the hard fought efforts! ",/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2017,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," It's grown on me!
","I really didn't like this show at first. My first bad impression was ""Montreal Police that speak English, with most cops having zero French accent... lame""",/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2017,info-12190,10," One of the BEST police shows & I'm from a police family
","I LOVE 19-2 and I'm bummed that the fourth season is the final season. I wish it would go on forever. There is a special quality to this show that is rarer than rare, as if all concerned are concerned with just doing their jobs and keeping it real, because real is the operative element here. I am going to watch this series again, it's that good! The only series I've watched twice are The Sopranos, when I got a big screen TV, and Prime Suspect, which is amazing. Come to think of it, it may be time to re-watch a few more of Lynda LaPlante's series. Acorn TV has them, as they have 19-2. TV is ten times better than movies now. We're all very lucky.",/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2014,jody-bilyj,8," Refreshing take on a cop show.
",It's refreshing to finally see an English language show that's filmed in Montreal actually be based in Montreal storyline wise. This show steers clear of the stereotypical cop characters and shows us many shades of grey rather than the standard black and white we too often see. I love the cold blueness of the shots.,/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2014,benny-nordberg,10," Bravo to Bravo
","I feel like Canadian TV has really stepped up its game in the last few years. I was blown away by 19-2 from the first scene and have not looked back. The character development has me fully committed to the outcomes of their lives. The story line really taps into the grittiness of real life and the challenges of the not so generic population. I love that this steps away from the white picket fence middle America and expresses some serious honesty. This show could have been really typical but it has been anything but - the feeling when I sit down and watch every week is that of a movie. I would rival this show to some original Netflix series that have done very well (Orange is the New Black). I will also never complain about a Nick Barron ""butt"" shot or watching Beatrice throw down for all of us girls out there. Bravo is setting a new standard with its actors as well and the attention to the details. I say Bravo - to Bravo and the cast of 19-2. You should all be proud, I know I am.",/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2014,karenmulhern,10," Surprisingly GREAT Canadian series
","From the first episode 19-2 distinguishes itself as a unique look inside a unit of urban patrolmen, giving equal glimpses of their lives on and off the job. This show is more character study than police procedural-- yes there are calls to answer and nerve wracking situations, but they exist as vehicles for developing our understanding of what makes these men and women tick as individuals and partners. The dialog is extremely well written and acted--the actors speak like real people in real situations. Occasionally scenes switch from what is happening IN the moment to what the characters are thinking OF the moment, a plot device that only works if a scene is expertly written,which is definitely the case here! Episode 10 just aired this week and a major (yet completely unanticipated) revelation occurred that I suspect will shift alliances and friendships within the unit. I have no idea what will happen next, but I'm sure it will be interesting!",/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2016,glensimpson-72209,9," 19-2 Truly Quality
","I was semi-surprised I suppose, to see the negative reviews. I waste very little time on TV these days, but there a few shows which I am very much drawn into.19-2 is certainly one of them. Along with Ballers, Game of Thrones, Ray Donovan, Bosch, (quite like the one with Lucifer on regular cable too) 19-2 is excellent. And, it's Canadian. The first time I came across Jared Keeso was LetterKenny. Classic for sure, if you played hockey in this country (Canada)! But wow, dude is a solid actor! He, and Nick Barron (not looking up his name right now) are excellent! I've been literally shocked by a couple episodes over the few years, and that rarely happens. Very real, and gritty, really good show! Honestly don't get what the haters are hating on. Unless it's compared to the French version which I just can't speak to (much love to my French Canadian brothers)! Give it a watch. I suspect you won't be disappointed!",/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2017,BabsbytheBeach,9," A cop show like no other
","It took me a few episodes to warm up to 19-2, but once I did, I was hooked. All of the rave reviews from the NYT and Wall Street Journal are spot on: this cop show is exactly what cop shows needed. I love the fact that the cops are not perfect, they suffer from PTSD, they make mistakes, they don't get along, and they sometimes have each others' backs. The viewer sometimes does not know who the heroes or villains are, because sometimes life just works that way. Adrian Holms and Jared Keeso are great as the central team you follow, and the supporting cast hold their own with equal skill. From exceptional scripts to fantastic casting, this gritty crime drama kept me bingeing until my eyes were seeing double. Acron.TV you need to upload the 2017 season, I'm suffering from withdrawal symptoms!",/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2018,virginiacottrell,10," Love this show
","Just great TV, are they not bringing it back? Excellent characters and script is pretty good, the Canadians are coming out with some good productions",/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2019,robgproduction,10," Best cop series I've seen
","As a lover of good cop drama, I've seen them all. 19-2 delivers drama, action, and the occasional piece of dark humour. Character development is brilliant and raw. Two thumbs up!",/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2014,sinpumaorig,10," Awesome Show
","I will admit that I have met a few of the actors that are in this show so at first I was afraid to watch it in case it was bad and I didn't like it. But I was so pleasantly surprised. It surpassed all my expectations! It is beautifully shot. The acting, from everyone, is great. Some performances are better than others but I feel like everyone is pulling their weight and I actually want to know what happens to them. One of the characters is so mean I really hate him and only a strong actor can make you feel that way. It is gritty and dirty and cops are portrayed in all different lights. We can see how people can overreact cause they don't have the full story and we also see how the cops can power trip and act badly. Overall this is a show that is worth your time and I will be watching it season after season!!",/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2021,Hawk-SRB,10," Stands out from most other cop shows
","Besides everyone complaining that this was filmed in English, I like the show. Each character having to deal with their own problems makes the show much more interesting, the drama element in the show is big, which is why my first impression was good.",/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2016,qui_j,2," Amateurish everything
","Watched this on Acorn and had high hopes for it. Unfortunately, it just has too many negative points to it. I would love to be able to access the French version as I understand it's much better, and more authentic. The English version really asks viewers to really stretch their imagination. The show is shot in Montreal but no one in the city seems to speak French. French signs abound but everyone speaks English with no trace of an accent. Wouldn't it have been better to do a complete revamp and set it in one of the English speaking Canadian cities? The acting is amateurish, and the editing really atrocious, using flashbacks at the most inappropriate times. That only confuses the viewer more, and really is not a very clever way to tell a story.The scenes end and start abruptly which underscores the amateurish editing. Will try to see where the French version can be viewed as this version really does not live up to the hype at all!",/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2016,dtdenver-987-925546,," Blah - disappointment
","I use a personal cheese-o-meter when it comes to cop shows. Does the buff black guy (because that's a requirement on TV) have shorter uniform sleeves than the other cops - to show off his hard-earned gym muscles? If yes, I brace myself for a steady and swift progression of clichés and stereotypes. Such was the case with the two episodes of 19-2 that I could force myself to watch. ""Character driven"" dramas can be tricky if the characters are sullen lumps whose lives are one problem after the other. The beauty of Montreal won't draw me back to that boring show - which is a shame because I try to bond with any show not filmed in California.",/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2016,ciorniiliv,8," Not your ordinary 'crime' show
","This show seriously deserves the great reviews, a brilliant show with incredible actors who give outstanding performances all through the series. This show surprised me on a grand scale, with impeccable story lines and even better executed characters. The character development throughout the show keeps you second guessing everything you are ever told about the shows' protagonists and have you yearning for more. The portrayal of street life is what I imagine it to be like in the real world. 19-2 has amazing twists and turns, it shows that even the black and white cases have some grey areas. The cinematography within the episodes themselves is beautiful and seriously warrants recognition. Each and every episode tackles a fresh angle and perspective on a story which is both realistic and completely fictional, through the balance is not perfect, it does come close.",/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv

15 May 2022,ursanddon,10," One of the best
","One of the best cop dramas ever. Maybe it's the fact that it's filmed somewhere I've never been or that the characters are so well portrayed. I'm watching the whole series for a second time. Excellent production. Very fast paced, especially the first two seasons.",/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2022,abbott-bill,10," Superb police procedural. Every episode seems better than previous. Satisfying ending.
","My wife and I were very impressed with season 1, episode 1, very smart writing, good acting, we thought, ""That was great, but they can't possibly keep it going at that level."" Ah, but they could! Every episode in season 1 is better than the one before it. How is that even possible?",/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2021,lmflaherty-93154,10," Astonishing Program - so glad I found it
","Having some friends and family in law enforcement, this show has opened my eyes to the things they go through and never talk about. It can be profoundly depressing, but helps me understand the heroism of the people that protect us. The Season 2, Episode 1 story is the one that has made me cry. The situation was presented as I am reasonably sure is what happens when people have to run into a situation and help people get away. So. Freaking. Intense.",/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2014,gdump,1," Bad. Just....bad.
","I only watched the first episode and half of the second because that was all I could stand. I don't care how popular the French version may be, this version is trash. I don't find either the characters or the situations believable. Worse, none of the characters are the least bit likable so I can't see myself ever caring what happens to them. What action there is consists mostly of cops yelling frantically at suspects and each other and generally acting like lunatics.",/review/rw2956881/?ref_=tt_urv
