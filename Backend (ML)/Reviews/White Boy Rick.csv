13 August 2020,BadgerStorm4345,10," Amazing World Building and Stellar Character Moments
","Made in Abyss is an anime that is severely underrated. This show can invoke so many different emotions out of you as it balances so many tones flawlessly. The characters drive the heart of this show and make us worried when they are put into dangerous situations. The danger is amplified by this beautiful world that never shies away from showing off it's true nature. The world never seems evil, it seems wild and untamed, balancing on a scale between chaos and beauty. The concept of the world itself is also executed better than I could have hoped for, constantly showing us functions to this incredibly interesting world that make sense. The Music in this show is also great and captures the beauty or horror of each and every moment our characters are put in. Made in Abyss is one of my favorite anime and deserves so much more praise.",/review/rw4927603/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2017,blackmamba99971,10," Beautiful series
","This is an incredible series I have ever watched. Riko a young girl explorer who is on a quest to find her mother deep within the chasms of the abyss which dwells beneath a village. Alongside her is a sophisticated robot named Reg. An automaton designed to protect Riko at all costs during their descent into another world that harbours strange creatures of such violence, and merciless fortitude that it takes Reg to fend them off using his ultra hyper weapon fist that can take out an entire mountain face with one blast. As they move deeper into the abyss's bowels the air quality starts to become more poisonous than the previous layer, but Riko's determination doesn't allow her to stop in attaining the truth about her mother.",/review/rw4927603/?ref_=tt_urv

",Throw in some Etrian Odyssey and you get a rough idea of what Made in Abyss might be.,/review/rw4927603/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2020,dameon_green,8," A wonderfully strange mix of light and dark tones.
",The story in the dubbed first movie is a surprising combination of what should be conflicting light and airy tones with a dark and bleak story and quest but to my surprise they came together masterfully.,/review/rw4927603/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2017,cmawer-62752,9," Anime Of The Year So Far For Sure

15 February 2019,hanentr,10," A Masterpiece
","Made in Abyss is going down as one of my favorite shows of all time. Not just one of my favorite animes, one of my favorite shows. The characters, world-building, plot progression, music, art style, animation, voice acting (sub and dub), everything is incredible.",/review/rw4927603/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2022,blackmamba99971,10," A leap beyond logic
","It has been four years since the movie came out to show us the next stage of Riko and her party's steep descent into the Abyss. And now, the new season that is aired so far has not once disappointed me. I have been an avid fan of Made in Abyss since 2017 and I must say the story just gets better and better. New creatures, new terror and pulse stopping shot scenes which leaves the viewer stunned.",/review/rw4927603/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2020,liban-30551,10," WAAAY better than expected!
","I am a 30 year old stoner dude, who usually watches action movies and so forth, but this was truly addictive, and gripped me from start. I don't usually comment like this, but this show deserves it. The story is a rollercoaster of emotions. And the music, OMG, what an amazing job they did on producing one of the most beautiful soundtracks I've heard on a show, just awed at how the music matches the atmosphere in every scene.
WOW!
I highly recommend this gem!",/review/rw4927603/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2017,MorDEk007,10," An absolutely fantastic anime with solid world-building, likable characters, and a gorgeous art style
","An absolutely fantastic anime with solid world-building, likable characters, and a gorgeous art style. The first episode immediately pulls you into the show and introduces you to the cast of characters and the beautiful world, and from there on it hooks the viewer with its fantastic lore and world-building, something which many shows are unable to do effectively. I'm telling you, go watch this anime right now; it's a unique gem that you absolutely will not regret watching.",/review/rw4927603/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2017,owenmayay,9," Stunning soundtrack and animation. Unique, surprisingly believable world.
","You can tell there was a ton of effort put into this series. As someone who doesn't like the current trends in anime these days, I found massive enjoyment watching Made in Abyss. This might not make sense, but it feels really pure and new. I highly recommend just diving straight into this series without knowing much about it.",/review/rw4927603/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2019,rookescanor,10," One of the best Adventure Anime in the years
","When I watched this anime for the first time, I knew that the author, Akihito Tsukushi, had put a lot of thought and love into the story and its development. I have watched a lot of adventure anime, and I have to admit the fact that this is the best one made in the past few years. I would even go on to say that it can be grouped within the mentions One Piece, Dragon Ball (referring to Part 1 of DB series) or Hunter x Hunter in terms of Story quality.",/review/rw4927603/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2022,TheGreatGreenBadger,10," Absolutely incredible!
","This show gives so much life to fantasy than never before. The world-building, visuals, and even the soundtrack is absolutely insane. Not to mention, the plot, specifically the last four episodes, is some of the best episodes of anime I have ever seen. Also, Nanachi cracks me up!",/review/rw4927603/?ref_=tt_urv

31 October 2018,austinlsweeney,9," What's that lurking in the shadows...?
",Made in Abyss looks childish. If you think it is for kids. You are Grosly mistaken! Stop that train of thought before it's too late.,/review/rw4927603/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2017,PennyReviews,8," Good enough
","At first glance, this anime seems childish and just cute, but it's far from it. From episode number one, it throws the viewer into a deep dive in a complex universe that has its mythology as well as many mysteries. The story has as many layers as the abyss, with the main characters fighting odd creatures and having major character developments in the process. And as they get deeper into the abyss, the darker the anime goes. And the more depressing as well. In the end, there were many questions answered, so hopefully there will be another season.",/review/rw4927603/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2019,keithsonatra,10," IF you are a fan of ANIME then you should watch this. NOT A KID SHOW BTW.
","Without spoiling anything I will just say that this is one of those GEMs that you run into whilst relentlessly looking for that New anime story to binge. I had just got done bingeing SAO Alicization and I really needed another anime that could hold up. Made in the Abyss has everything I look for in an anime. Beautiful Artwork, a Quest, interesting characters, breath taking scenery, just enough comedy to not be over the top, and something original about the story itself to separate it from other animes. The look of the show could be likened to having sceneries like studio ghibli, with the character designs resembling Aniplex Projects like SAO and FMA. Im 4 episodes deep and if all keeps moving at the pace it has been, then I will hold this title with other cherished Animes of mine like Dragon Ball, FMA, SAO, Inuyasha, and countless other Animes I love to watch. So if you are looking for that visually astounding unique adventure story I think this is it.",/review/rw4927603/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2017,nodlimax,9," Interesting story even though it starts slowly
",This show went from one I was intending to skip to my favorite this season. When you look at the initial picture for the anime it looks like it is made for children due to the art style.,/review/rw4927603/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2020,Arglebarglemorblewhoosh,10," Beautiful, sophisticated, and deeply emotional
","This is a marvelous show. I cannot wait for season two. The character development is wonderful, and the storyline is remarkably sophisticated and keeps popping up with new twists that don't feel artificial or done just to surprise you. My wife and I both cried at the end of episode 12 and through much of episode 13. The best thing is really the writing - never a false step, full of mysteries and wonders and hazards, beautifully paced, and so much better than what you find in nearly any other series around today. Watch it, and take your time!",/review/rw4927603/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2022,officialnoonon,10," Rather well known and yet still so underrated
","Made in Abyss is an experience you can't explain with words alone. While watching this show you will see one of the most fantastical fantasy worlds imaginable come to live. The visuals are simply incredible, characters are well thought out, and the music... You will listen to the most beautiful pieces ever. Unfortunately, the other reviewers are right in that Made in Abyss is not meant for kids. In fact, it is one of the saddest shows I know. Made in Abyss is a 10/10 and masterpiece no question.",/review/rw4927603/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2022,Sh31kh_H0kv5,9," I have taken into the abyss, behold it's wonderful down here
","Another insane Master piece gosh, there's no end to the adventures in the abyss this has me on a leash and am dying to know more, unique story line creatures and so much more, this work is a work of beauty polished and admired by all who saw it, believe me you'll be captivated.",/review/rw4927603/?ref_=tt_urv

5 December 2020,SoverniX,10," Once you go all the way down, the road can only lead up...
","Here is an excellent embodiment of the steampunk model! The Abyss with its numerous and unsolved secrets that the main characters comprehend from series to series. The plot captures from the very beginning, and I want to emphasize that the film adaptation of such an exquisite manga turned out to be excellent. The main characters, for whom you really worry, their fates and trials in the Abyss do not leave you indifferent, sometimes you find that tears roll up - and, both from despair in seemingly hopeless situations, and from happiness, when joy covers instantly. I admired the way the series organically intertwines complex dramas with saving humor, which, by the way, in some places rolls over to the limit. Amazing drawing, fabulous musical atmosphere and of course unique images of characters-all this makes the anime ""Created in the Abyss"" really cool and meaningful! For sure, like me, many people liked the nice Reg, the language will not turn to say that it is not real. And this is one of the moral features of this anime! His attitude to understanding the duty to a loved one and selfless love can give odds, perhaps, to any of the residents of Ous. Yes, he may be naive and a little indecisive, but there is a lot of sincerity and determination in him. Funny and at the same time very serious character, around which in season 1 there were no less mysteries than the fate of the young Rico. Today, many fans are waiting with bated breath for the release of second season, prudently not looking at the manga, so as not to break the intrigue of anticipation.",/review/rw4927603/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2022,ge_oh,10," 1 ep and this is already a 10

11 June 2019,aarongnr,10," Flawless
","4 episodes in and so far the show is flawless. The story is intruiging, the animation wonderful and the best part: The dialogue. It's so refreshing to see characters actually act smart for once. I watch so many shows and there's so many occcations in which characters act in an absolutely absurd way. Not here. Flawless dialogue so far.",/review/rw4927603/?ref_=tt_urv
