16 October 2021,pranayjalvi,10," Perfect is not just a word for Sardar Udham
","Shoojit Sircar showed us once again how a biopic should be made, and the level of Sardar Udham waa extraordinary. Vicky Kaushal is a rising star and his role of Sardar Udham showed us why he is a great contender for Bollywood's future.",/review/rw7457142/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2021,MandalBros-5,10," CAN'T Review.
","After watching the brutal and heart-wrenching visuals of Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, I can't review this film. And yes, India is yet to receive an official apology from the British Government for the same.",/review/rw7457142/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2021,matrixdukenukem,10," The third act broke me permanently
","This is not an easy movie to recommend. I was on the verge of turning it off unable to take it any more but out of respect, somehow kept going. Never ever has Jallianwala Baug massacre portrayed this way in history of cinema. This is however the most important film to come out in recent times.",/review/rw7457142/?ref_=tt_urv

16 October 2021,kumarujjal,9," The heaviest last one hour of Cinematic history!
",I was crying the whole second half of the film. The core emotion of that last hour was so heavy that your tears will automatically fall out. The documentation style of approach to the story definitely made the viewing experience very personal and interactive. The screenplay in the first half does confused me a bit but it did the job of making me invested in the actuality.,/review/rw7457142/?ref_=tt_urv

16 October 2021,cs_rahul_kumar,10," Vicky Kaushal's Sardar Udham Is A Ticking Time Bomb Waiting To Explode !!!
","The film pays tribute to an unsung hero - Sardar Udham Singh (Vicky Kaushal), an Indian revolutionary, who assassinated Michael O'Dwyer in London (in 1940), to avenge the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre (of 1919). The former British colonial official was the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab (British India) at the time. Dwyer had said the killing of hundreds of protesters during a demonstration at Jallianwala Bagh in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, was justified.",/review/rw7457142/?ref_=tt_urv

16 October 2021,madonnicallysony,9," Long live Udham Singh!
",This movie is a masterpiece. Loved that it presented the true facts and was not altered for the sake of commercialism. The last half an hour of the movie is heart wrenching. The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre left a deep impact on the entire nation. The movie feels a bit stretched in between as the scenes keep ping ponging between present and the flashback. Vicky Kaushal gives his best performance. This movie deserves an Oscar nomination.,/review/rw7457142/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2021,nidhunmoviebuff,8," Vicky Kaushal's monumental performance does justice to the tale of a legendary freedom fighter!
","Shoojit Sircar delivers yet another nuanced, offbeat yet impactful cinema experience after Vicky Donor (2012), Madras Cafe (2013) and Piku (2015) in Udham Singh, riding on an immense performance from Vicky Kaushal.",/review/rw7457142/?ref_=tt_urv

16 October 2021,nithinjayram,10," A perfect biopic
","Brilliant filmmaking. Shoojit Sarcar has done it again. Good depiction of Jallianwala bagh massacre. A bit slow and long, can be tolerated. Vicky koushal is brilliant, he is really a great actor.

",I just finished watching Sardar Udham streaming on Amazon Prime. To be honest I was a bit skeptical about the film's length and the pacing as brought up in most of the critic reviews. After watching the film I can safely say without a doubt that it is a masterpiece!,/review/rw7457142/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2021,JassiMusafir,10," Huge Respect for the whole Team
","No words to describe, I am from Amritsar and I felt that justice is done by all the characters. Hat's off to Vicky performance no one could have done better than him. His punjabi accent was accurate. Huge respect for the director,producer and whole team. This is something beyond expectations. We all knew Sardar Udham singh story but never in this way.

","When Bollywood makes biopics, they tend to follow that one route --> start from childhood, show him/her rise and then show the events that follow. Shoojit Sircar is different and so are his films including SARDAR UDHAM.",/review/rw7457142/?ref_=tt_urv
