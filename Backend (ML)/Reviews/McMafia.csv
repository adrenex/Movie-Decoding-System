27 July 2002,FlickJunkie-2,9," Halle Berry's shining moment
","Independent filmmaking is alive and well and evident in Monster's Ball. This film had a minuscule $4 million budget, a terrific script and a director not afraid to take some risks.  Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry practically donated their time they were paid so little.  The result is a powerful and disturbing film that walked off with a boatload of awards, not the least of which was a best actress Oscar for Berry.",/review/rw1202615/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) is the middle generation of three generations of prison guards. His father Buck (Peter Boyle) is long retired and a near-invalid, using a walker and leaning on an iron lung. His son Sonny (Heath Ledger) is a novice guard.

31 March 2002,jhclues,10," Extraordinary Performances by Berry and Thornton
","It's very rare, but occasionally a film comes along that plays out so realistically that it doesn't even seem like you're watching a movie, but participating-- albeit as an observer-- in this particular drama of life that is unfolding around you.  And so it is with `Monster's Ball,' a riveting film, directed by Marc Forster, that is so real it transcends entertainment and becomes a voyeuristic experience that leaves you with the sense that you've been through everything that's happened yourself.  It's a thought provoking examination of relationships and perspectives, including the ingrained, subjective attitudes-- especially prejudices-- that have such a profound and lasting affect on our lives, as well as the lives of those around us.  It's a film that says so much about the way we respond to one another, as well as certain situations, and why; in short, it's about the world that we, as a society, have created and must live in together-- right or wrong, good or bad, black or white.  And at the heart of the story is a message that rings through loud and true; a perception that we can do better-- and must-- if we are to survive as a civilized, dignified and progressive species.  In the final analysis, we are, all of us, members of the family of Man; and it's time we realize and acknowledge it.",/review/rw1202615/?ref_=tt_urv

21 March 2005,philip_vanderveken,8," A very compelling and sincere movie
","Monster's Ball wasn't made with a big budget by some very well known director. And to make things ""worse"", it's controversial as well because the story isn't exactly about a family living together happy with more money than there is water in the sea. And they weren't afraid to put a lot of racism in it, which was necessary to make this movie believable, but for some ""politically correct"" people, already reasons enough to say they didn't like it.",/review/rw1202615/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2002,Rogue-32,10," I can't convey to you how extraordinary this film is.
","This is a rare achievement, Monster's Ball, a film that relies on its characters' internal lives and the audiences' intelligence to read between the lines - deeply between the lines. A profound experience that will change anyone who sees it with an open, compassionate, life-educated mind.",/review/rw1202615/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2003,Uqbar,," Disturbing, engaging work
","This is the kind of gritty, fuzz-free reality drama that keeps you musing about it long past the ending credits. It is unsparing in its depiction of all the light and dark sides of the human psyche, from racism to passion to insularity and even corpulence, mounting these on a platform so stark and unambiguous that the audience is not left with many choices - the reactions evoked are exactly the ones intended to be evoked, oscillating between disgust, outrage, sympathy, tenderness and occasionally, even a surreptitious smile.",/review/rw1202615/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2003,Anonymous_Maxine,10," Yeah Puff!
","Wow, I never thought I'd say that. Puff Daddy should have gone straight to acting in the first place and saved himself the embarrassment of his rap career. He does a wonderful job in this wonderful movie portraying a death row inmate named Tyrell Musgrove, the husband of Leticia, played by Halle Berry. The film starts off dealing with the relationship between Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) and his son Sonny (Heath Ledger) and Sonny's learning the ropes of becoming a prison guard like his dear old dad. Tyrell is a complicated character because we automatically sympathize with the enormity of his situation, trying to explain to his son in front of a prison guard why he's not going to be around anymore, but at the same time he accepts his fate because he has brought it upon himself. It is significant that this is a man who has committed a crime and doesn't fight against the system when the punishment is imposed, because he deserves it. In one of the most potent lines in the entire film, he tells his son, `I'm a bad man, you're the best of me.'",/review/rw1202615/?ref_=tt_urv

12 June 2002,=G=,9," A very human tale of redemption
","""Monster's Ball"" tells of a white man and a black woman in the rural South coming together through desperate human need; each suffering grief, guilt, remorse, and misery. A slow, plodding drama with rumbling racial undercurrents, the film tells a simple story, though not uneventful, with finely nuanced performances, especially by Berry who earned her keep and kudos. Recommended for mature audiences into serious drama.",/review/rw1202615/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2016,seymourblack-1,9," Simple, Uncompromising & Poignant
","Capital punishment, racism and abusive parents feature strongly in this story about the healing power of love and its great ability to grow in even the most unlikely circumstances. The mood is often sombre and the characters' feelings of despair, grief and regret are profound. Despite all of this, the hope and comfort that unexpected love can bring is ultimately shown as being able to point the way to hope and optimism for the future. In the wrong hands, a story like this could easily have developed into a melodramatic slush-fest but fortunately in this case, the movie was directed more intelligently with uncompromising depictions of its characters and the romantic developments being presented without sentimentality.",/review/rw1202615/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's a well known fact that MONSTER'S BALL won Halle Berry an Oscar for best actress and led to one of the most bizarre sites in the history of the ceremony where Berry shrieked , wept and gnashed her teeth in an uncontrollable manner . She probably wasn't overcome with emotion - She was impersonating the average person's reaction to seeing this film !",/review/rw1202615/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2002,bix171,10," A Must-See
","Superb. All the elements of superior filmmaking are very much in evidence in Marc Forster's tale of racism and redemption in the Deep South, not the least of which is Forster's passionate yet understated direction. He's a foreigner (born in Germany and raised in Switzerland) but unlike other foreign directors making films in Hollywood (Sam Mendes being a prime example), he seems to have a clear insight into how Americans respond to their surroundings and has no interest in patronizing his audience by exploiting those responses. Forster's use of camera placement is impressive: many of the scenes are shot in a way that makes us feel we're eavesdropping on some very intimate moments; and the feeling that the characters are caged by their surroundings is evoked through his use of line. The spare and sophisticated screenplay (by Milo Addica and Will Rokas) is about institutionalized bigotry passed down in a womanless family of prison guards (father Peter Boyle, son Billy Bob Thornton and grandson Heath Ledger) and how extreme emotions come to resolve the ambiguity associated with such hatred--the characters, in their search for release from hatred's grip, become better men by taking the actions they take. The performances couldn't be better: Halle Berry gives the performance of a lifetime as the black woman who enters and fulfills Thornton's life; she acts with an intelligence and uncommon vulnerability that gives her character dignity in spite of her contradictions; and Thornton, for a change, refuses to mug it up for the camera. (Boyle, Ledger and Sean Combs in smaller roles, are equally fine.) The evocatively saturated camerawork is by Roberto Schaefer and the quietly effective score is by Asche and Spencer. It will be interesting to see where the careers of all associated with `Monster's Ball' go but this stands a powerful testament to their talent.",/review/rw1202615/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2002,moonspinner55,8," Heavy-going, yet beautifully presented...
","A carousel of depressed lives: a correctional officer--brought up in a racist household--has a romance with the African-American wife of the last man executed under his supervision, an incident which ultimately led to the suicide of the officer's own son, while the widow is still grieving the loss of her son in a hit-and-run accident. Heavy with irony, this piece almost withers under its weighty elements, but there are compensations: performances by Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry are top-notch, and the director handles them just right; the dialogue is well-written throughout, with the conversational scenes very natural and overshadowing the more predictable mechanics of the plot. When Thornton paints the woman's name on the front of his new gasoline station and a friend comes up and reads it (""Leticia""), it's gratifying to hear Thornton say, ""That's my girlfriend."" It's little moments such as this which give ""Monster's Ball"" a haunting and tangible spin. The much-discussed love scene, with flickers of a hand trying to catch a bird in its cage, is both revealing and artistically surreal, a nice mix (and a surprising one). But the story passages are fairly rote; only the characters themselves--and how they relate to the circumstances involved--keep the movie strong. *** from ****",/review/rw1202615/?ref_=tt_urv

28 August 2011,classicsoncall,8," ""It truly takes a human being to really see a human being"".
","Overall, the film makes a powerful statement about racial relations and how a person can overcome life long prejudices if one is willing to see things from the other person's point of view. Both lead characters, Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) and Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry) make this transition through horrific personal tragedies, initially finding each other through desperation, then building their relationship through mutual respect and understanding. It would be a toss up as to which one had the harder time of it, but both take the leap of faith that all interracial couples must come to grips with eventually.",/review/rw1202615/?ref_=tt_urv

28 November 2021,LawrenceofAsia,8," Sad, thoughtful, and intelligent
","The theme of this movie includes racism (without cliches though), generational gap, and healing after tragedy. It is a heavy and sad film, with a very thoughtful and intelligent script, which was nominated for an Oscar. The performances of both leads, especially Halle Berry's, are stunning. She won an Oscar for that, the first and only one so far for African-American actresses. But I think the movie would be better without the sex scenes, as that transient physical feeling cannot heal spiritual wounds anyway.",/review/rw1202615/?ref_=tt_urv
