19 March 2009,scarletminded,10," Better Off Ted has promise
",I just saw the pilot for this show and want to write about how I liked it. Mainly because I feel shows aren't given time to find an audience and maybe me voicing my like of the show will give it a chance.,/review/rw4693506/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2020,AudioFileZ,9," Best Lampoon of Wall Street Induced Corporate Greed Ever
",This is now a decade old and nothing I can remember in that time came close except maybe The Office. Ahem...these two shows are both finding gold with satire over the white collar corporate mentality and the workplace that results from such.,/review/rw4693506/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2019,ksdilauri,9," A gem that deserves to be seen.
","As most of the other reviews bring out, this series was a victim of the network's itchy hatchet fingers. A lot of us didn't become aware of it until well after its cancellation-and it was like discovering hidden treasure. The first season is especially good-it has the quick wit and irreverence of ""Arrested Development"" in the guise of a standard workplace comedy. The writing in the second season shows signs of getting lazy by adding too many sex jokes in unnecessary places, but the gifted cast makes up for it-often taking the otherwise-clever dialogue and situations through the 4th wall very naturally. It's not easy to pull off this kind of comedy, but it's so seamless that it becomes perfectly normal in Veridian Dynamics' button-down business world. A perfect cast, in a comedy that should have run longer. It deserves a place of honor in TV history.",/review/rw4693506/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2009,DirectorsCut19,9," A Very Funny Comedy With Potential To Last
","""Better Off Ted"" chronicles the title character's business in Veridian Industries, a corporation that has a group of scientists come up with various ideas and creations to test and sell to the public. Some of these ideas include business chairs that has fabric employees find uncomfortable, yet they improve productivity because employees won't be able to daydream.",/review/rw4693506/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2021,patrickfilbeck,10," Wrongly so unnoticed - almost iconic in the representation of the modern corporate world
","Better off Ted is a festival of humor, a great, funny allegory of capitalist business and research, and staged in a way that is (almost) unique on television. An underrated secret tip for anyone who dares to look beyond the warmed-up edge of the established sitcoms and embark on a fun adventure that manages to make you think through laughing. Only 30 rock can be compared to the manner of this series.",/review/rw4693506/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2010,Animus,9," The best comedy that people aren't watching
","Much like the doomed and also extremely well done Sports Night, Better Off Ted is a hysterical comedy with a top notch cast. The interaction between Ted and his co-stars is fantastic, his nonchalance with Veronica over the fate of innocents, his empathy with Linda, his ability to get past the jargon of Phil and Lem, all classic. The story lines are funny, the fake commercials a riot and the ""anti-dilbert"" vibe is refreshing. While each character is indeed a caricature of a typical corporate employee, Better Off Ted makes those caricatures come to life in ways not often seen in prime time comedy. I hope this series get renewed for 10 years. I love Better off Ted.",/review/rw4693506/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2018,jimjoe12543,10," One of the funniest shows to ever be cancelled
","I do not know what happened with ABC between 2004 and 2016, but they underfunded, misrepresented, lacked promotion, and otherwise failed every worthwhile TV show they produced. Better Off Ted is the poster-child of this complete corporate incompetence.",/review/rw4693506/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2018,marcus-chugh,10," Why did they cancel?
","Probably the worst network decision of all time to cancel this smart, witty, fast, well acted life changing show.",/review/rw4693506/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2009,Octochicken,10," Great new show that deserves a chance
","I don't usually do this kind of thing, but I'm tired of great shows getting canned before they get a chance to grow an audience. I have no idea how the ratings are for this show, but it's my favorite new show and might quickly become my new favorite show.",/review/rw4693506/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2013,SnoopyStyle,8," Fun wacky workplace sitcom
",Ted Crisp (Jay Harrington) is middle management trying to rise thru the ranks of Veridian Dynamics while raising his daughter Rose. Veronica Palmer (Portia de Rossi) is his immediate boss. Linda Zwordling (Andrea Anders) is a sweet cubicle worker. Phil Myman (Jonathan Slavin) and Lem Hewitt (Malcolm Barrett) are lab techs doing crazy stuff.,/review/rw4693506/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2009,bogsplatt,10," Absolute Genius
","What a fantastic show. It is a hilarious satirical commentary on the offices of scientific research and technology companies. It is amazing how to close to reality some of their material cuts for those of us that work in R&D departments. It is also a very 'fun' show, the writers must really enjoy having a decent budget to make spoof advertising for their pretend corporation. Sometimes it is good to stand back from life and take stock of the really important things, and this satire certainly jabs away at the ludicrous of the modern office environment, where being creative requires a constant battle with the middle-management Ogres.",/review/rw4693506/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2009,cary713,10," Best Show Since 'Arrested Development'
","Portia de Rossi is even better in this show, and I was surprised to find none of the same writer/directors from A.D. listed in the credits. The Veridian Dinamics 'commercials' are fantastic. Throughout the show I had to try not to laugh too loud, so as not to distract my co-workers.;) Funniest show I've seen in a long time. I have to agree with one of the other posts that the comedy is targeted and intelligent, which is hard to find these days. I am continually disappointed in most comedy shows, but every once in a while a gem like this comes along.",/review/rw4693506/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2010,Tactrix,10," This show is fantastic!

21 July 2009,shevia,10," Funny, smart & original commentary on corporate America
","Veridian Dynamics is a large corporation that invents, tests and markets everything from deadly pumpkins to beef that tastes like despair. Ted works there as a manager. He's a good and sane man in a heartless--and often insane--corporate environment. The comedy in this series comes from seeing just how insane work at Veridian can be and the hoops Ted jumps through to keep the insanity in check.",/review/rw4693506/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2009,diesel333333,9," Different kind of humor
","I am a big fan of this show. It really compliments my Wednesday nights of Scrubs and South Park. I don't expect this show to do well or even stay on the air long, which is a bummer. The humor is dry, intelligent and very targeted to a specific audience. Lucky I think I am their target audience... ",/review/rw4693506/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2013,purrlgurrl,9," Too smart and funny for network TV
",Which is why it ran only two seasons and became increasingly difficult to find as it was shuttled through days and time slots.,/review/rw4693506/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2009,CitizenShane,9," Quick, witty and oddly hilarious!
","Saw the first episode last night 'On Demand' on Australian pay TV. I often sit back and watch the 'On Demand' stuff because I want see what I like and what I don't, and more often than not I see what I don't.",/review/rw4693506/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2017,bbshockwave,10," The best office comedy every!
","I make a point to re-watch this show every 2-3 years or so. And I don't do that often. Maybe because I work at an IT company myself, but so much of the absurdity that comes with working for a giant multicorporation is familiar to me (such as the episode with the memo asking for employees to ""NOW use offensive language at work"", or the company's idea to redecorate personal workspaces). But also because of the quirky and likable characters - Ted, the likable boss obsessed with being a good father and a good boss, Veronica who might be actually a very human-like robot with very low grasp on this thing meatbags call ""emotions"", rebellious but well-meaning Linda, and bumbling nerdy ""mad"" scientists Lem and Phil. The show relies a lot on quick cutaways and inserts sarcastic (yet almost eerily realistic) adverts for the non-existing Veridian Dynamics company every now and then. Frankly, there isn't a single episode I could not recommend, the show is that good. I am still sad that it did not last more than two seasons. And the final episodes of the second season are hard to come by as they were only released on DVD, never aired. Give it a watch if you like office comedy - it is non-stop comedy, never a dull moment.",/review/rw4693506/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2022,Meesh85,10," Should Have Never Been Canceled!
",Such a smart and hilarious show with a cast that had great chemistry. I can't believe this show was canceled after only 2 seasons. One of my all time favorites. The creator also created Santa Clarita Diet which featured several Better Off Ted cast members and another show ended too soon!,/review/rw4693506/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2018,funkatron-39949,10," One of the funniest TV series ever
","Without a doubt this series is one of the funniest there has been. It's tongue in cheek, sarcastic, in your face, and just purely genius throughout. It's unfortunate the series was cancelled because it had the makings of becoming something exceptional. Thankfully there are a few episodes to keep you going :) bring it back I say!",/review/rw4693506/?ref_=tt_urv

15 August 2011,CelldwellerNS,10," Hilarious, zany and extremely well-written.
","Better Off Ted is a great show. Unfortunately I, like everyone else, didn't watch it while it was on-air and now it's been canceled due to low viewership. The characters are all very likable and interesting, but also wacky and just plain fun. One of my favorite parts of this series is how characters develop and there is actual continuity in the story, previous episodes are referenced later and such. In other screwball comedies like Scrubs I felt the show went on with a story and feigned character development but by the later seasons the characters were still making the same stupid mistakes and had the same character flaws. I realize writing a comedy show with continuity can be difficult, because it's easier for them to ignore realism for the sake of laughs, but Better Off Ted actually did this well. Being set in a completely unrealistic world in the dystopian mega-corporation helps this, I'm sure, and the company's commercials display this very well.",/review/rw4693506/?ref_=tt_urv
