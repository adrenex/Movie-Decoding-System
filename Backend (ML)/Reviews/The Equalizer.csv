22 September 2007,mollymormonbrat,7," Not the most original, but sweet, harmless and entertaining!
","Maybe I just haven't seen a good ""teen girl"" movie in so long. In fact, I don't remember the last time I went and saw a ""teen girl"" movie. Maybe if there were more out there was fun as this, I would. Basically, I had boring, rainy Saturday and a little sister. The trip to the theatre wound up with the two us laughing our heads off and all the appropriate ""aww"" moments.",/review/rw3360835/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2007,jaddison383,5," Modern Day Fairy Tale...
","Don't we all wish our lives could be fairy tales??? In this movie, that's exactly what one naive and tomboyish girl named Sydney White gets. To us, it seems like a rather familiar story.",/review/rw3360835/?ref_=tt_urv

","I found this simple tale charming and entertaining. It was funny without filth. The cinematography was quite lovely in many spots. It was fun to see John Schneider in a mature role for the first time in a long while. I feel that Amanda is a lovely, talented young girl who did a good job with the role. All the geeks were comical and interesting in their own individual ways. The facial expressions of George were absolutely endearing and evoked hilarious laughter several times. I found myself wanting to bring them all home for a good meal! I especially liked the excellent life-lesson shown for all of our society and wholeheartedly recommend this film for everyone over the age of 12. Younger kids just won't get it nor enjoy it.",/review/rw3360835/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2007,Robert_duder,9," All right I get it...it's not going to make movie classic history...I loved it...going outside the box I suppose
","The cold hard truth is I knew walking into this film that I was going to come out smiling having seen a movie that I really liked that most people will not and will continually make fun of it. So I'll do something I rarely do and right this from just my own personal experience and how I felt about it. I'm a smack in the face sucker for teen flicks, especially remakes of classics redone with the modern High School/College Twist...ie: Ten Things I Hate About You, Get Over it, and now this one. Sydney White was just cute...it had some real tongue in cheek humor and didn't try to be anything but what it was...a genre inducing, demographically aimed film that hits the nail on the head. Granted you have to let go of reality and accept the nearly insulting barrage of stereotypical clumping that the film provides but aren't all teeny flicks like that? I admit that while watching the seven 'dorks' I got a tinge of offensiveness creeping up because it is kind of harsh towards certain attributes even if they were made out to be the anti-heroes of the film. The attention to adding in little references to the Original Snow White Story was pretty well done including a hilarious (I thought it was hilarious) Hi-Hoe line delivered by a couple of the 'dorks.' Some of it might have been a little forced...the Poison Apple should have happened earlier on and the names ""Witchburn"" and ""Prince"" were almost a little much but even still the film is cute and funny and fluffy in all the right places.",/review/rw3360835/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2008,disdressed12,8," modern update on Snow White?
","i think this is a modern retelling of the snow white fairy tale.it has most of the same types of characters as the fairy tale does.but instead of dwarfs,it has dorks.and the movie takes place on a college campus.it's an under dog movie,so it is fairly predictable,but it is a fun movie to watch.there is a great mix of characters with odd quirks,and Armada Bynes is so likable it's hard not to like the movie.she has great comedic timing and plays the fish out of water role very well.i laughed quite a bit throughout the movie.i like the fact that it's a movie that takes place on campus,but is not raunchy,or low brow.it's nice to know a movie can be funny and entertaining without being crude,lewd or offensive.not that there's anything wrong with that.i also really liked Sara Paxton as the school president/villainess.i thought she was very convincing.overall, a very entertaining 100 plus minutes.my vote for Sydney White is an 8/10",/review/rw3360835/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2007,brettchatz-1,6," Snow White and the seven dorks
","Sydney White stars popular actress Amanda Bynes as the new girl in an elite college sorority. The Kappa Sisterhood is made up of a group of size 2 beautiful clones, all praising their mean-spirited leader, Rachel Witchburn (Sara Paxton).",/review/rw3360835/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2010,Cedric_Catsuits,8," Borderline flop rescued by Bynes
","Watching this brought back uncomfortable memories of 'House Bunny' although the latter was released a year later and I didn't buy the DVDs in chronological order. Where this succeeds and HB fails, is that Amanda Bynes makes the best of her role but Anna Faris looked very uncomfortable in hers - which to be fair to her was rather exploitative..",/review/rw3360835/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2007,Slwells5815,9," A genuinely good movie
","In our day and age, it's very difficult to find a truly funny film that is also fairly sweet and innocent. Having grown up as a fairy tale princess wannabe, I've seen my share of fairy tale spin-offs, and this has by far been the best one. I was almost afraid to watch this movie, seeing as it was PG-13 and that doesn't really mean anything anymore (could be clean, like Sydney White, could be completely raunchy). However, I was pleasantly surprised by its clever writing. Some may complain that it is too stereotypical with the cliques, but I would point out that the gorgeous Prince Charming is also a genuinely decent guy, not just Mr. Popularity as in most films. I mean, let's face it: fairy tales were pretty stereotypical to begin with. Evil queens, handsome princes, princesses in danger or in hiding, or regular girls becoming princesses. But that doesn't make it any less of a good story. Overall, I found it highly entertaining and terrifically charming. Truly heartwarming to a fairy tale fan like myself, and even to my dad, who decided to accompany me to the movie because he had nothing better to do--and believe me, it's not easy to entertain my dad with 'chick flicks'.",/review/rw3360835/?ref_=tt_urv

20 September 2007,Pranksalot,10," Charming as well as Hilarious
","This movie is a rarity, genuine humor is displayed throughout the film without using sex jokes/raunchiness references. That's is what comedy films need to strive for which is clean wholesome humor unlike movies such as SuperBad, Borat, Wedding Crashers, and Knocked Up. I know it's difficult with today's society to come up with clean jokes with what is shown on television now days, which is why Sydney White deserves several rounds of applause. I can't even think of a college movie which does not have at least one dirty joke or being as wholesome as this film. According to an article Amanda is the one who told the writers to tone down the script and not make it raunchy. Amanda Bynes as the leading performer in this movie is phenomenal. She is hysterically funny as well as being cute as a button. Amanda is destined to have a long career in the comedy field since there isn't many actresses out there who can even ""do"" comedy. What Amanda have and not many other actors/actresses is her facial expressions. Her facial expressions makes the movie 10 times better. It's as if Amanda is two actresses wrapped in one.",/review/rw3360835/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2007,mcsheehey,4," It's no ""She's the Man""
","Amanda Bynes is an enormously talented actress, and I've really enjoyed all of her roles in the past, especially in the fantastic ""She's the Man."" For that reason alone, ""Sydney White"" was a huge disappointment for me. The real reason for my dislike of this film is the poor use of characters. In a good fun teen comedy, its perfectly alright to have a cast of all fairly reality-based teen characters. In ""Sydney White,"" this idea is thrown out the window.",/review/rw3360835/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2018,ComedyFan2010,7," Modern day Snow White
","The movie isn't original. We all have seen many revenge of the nerds/dorks/good guys movies. So you know how it ends before it starts. The bad characters are also so one sided and boring. Nothing special about them, they are just overdone bad.",/review/rw3360835/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2008,dweezledap,9," Great Movie for the whole family.

7 August 2008,MLDinTN,5," Am I a dork because I thought this movie was just OK
","This movie is more suited for young teens. It's a teen retelling of Snow White. Tomboy Sydney White goes off to college and pledges to her mom's frat, which is run by the witch, Rachel. Rachel is jealous and kicks Sydney out. Sydney must go live with the 7 dorks whom live in the Vortex house. Sydney also meets a guy whose last name happens to be Prince. He is Rachel's ex and was in favor of tearing down the Vortex to build a Greek center. But after hanging with Syd and the dorks he realizes they aren't that bad and doesn't want to go ahead with the plan. There is also the student elections in which Syd decides to go up against Rachel. There are other things that are similar to snow white, like the looking mirror, the kiss from a prince, etc...",/review/rw3360835/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2007,wilddiva411,10," ""Snow White"" Meets ""Revenge of the Nerds""
","Sydney White is the offspring of Snow White and Revenge of the Nerds. Let's just say this is A GOOD THING, NOT A BAD THING. I actually laughed out loud during this movie and it's the third movie Amanda Bynes has been in that I laughed at (She's the Man, Hairspray, Sydney White). If you loved She's the Man, then you know what kind of actress Amanda Bynes is and you know that she can make a great movie. Sydney's love interest, Tyler Prince, is the perfect guy. He's sweet, caring, gorgeous, lovable, charming, and is not at all like a typical frat guy. He's crazy about Sydney because she stands out from all the sorority look-alikes. Sydney also meets 7 adorable and hysterical dork/nerds who live in the Vortex (a home for those who do not fit in). Sydney thinks that it's best if they run the Student Council (sounds a little like Revenge of the Nerds) so that their ""outsider"" voices, as well as other non-sorority/fraternity students, can be heard. This is the kind of movie all teenage girls (and maybe some guys) will love. The actors are great, the script is great, and the movie is just fantastic. I'd recommend this movie to anyone for any occasion. GO SEE SYDNEY WHITE!!!!",/review/rw3360835/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2011,jotix100,4," Sydney (Snow) White and the seven dorks!
","Sydney White, a girl from a working class family, goes to the same college where her late mother graduated, something that makes her a legacy candidate for the Kappa sorority. Little does Sydney realize what awaits her when she makes an enemy of the powerful president of the student body, and the Kappas, Rachel Witchburn. It becomes apparently that the mean spirited Rachel does not like competition and she will make anything in her power to make life impossible for Sydney.",/review/rw3360835/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2008,planktonrules,8," Despite a PG-13 rating it's a good family flick...and it made me smile.
","The idea for SYDNEY WHITE isn't all that new. I am not referring to the fact that the film is a re-telling of the story of Snow White, but that this same concept was done with the wonderful Barbara Stanwyck and Gary Cooper film BALL OF FIRE. It, too, was a retelling of this Brother's Grimm story, though BALL OF FIRE was done much more subtly--so much so that many seeing the film didn't realize the similarities. Here, though, the similarities are far from subtle--making this much more a film for younger and less savvy crowds. Now I am NOT saying that SYDNEY WHITE is a bad film (it isn't), but that it is just a lot more obvious in it's parallels.",/review/rw3360835/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2014,SnoopyStyle,7," Good simple Revenge of the Nerds movie
","Sydney White (Amanda Bynes) lost her mother at the age of 9. She was raised by her plumber single father and the guys around the construction site. She gets a scholarship and intends to get into the Kappa sorority just as her mother had. However she's just isn't the right kind of girl according to sorority president Rachel (Sara Paxton). And when Rachel's 'boyfriend' Tyler (Matt Long) shows interest in Sydney, Rachel denies Sydney entry.

2 February 2008,TxMike,," Take-off from 'Snow White', Bynes makes it a better than average movie.

24 September 2007,iheartstrawberrylemonade,10," A hilarious teen comedy with a message
","I came to the theater on Friday wanting to see it because I saw the commercials and thought it looked like a cute movie and I always like Amanda Bynes's movies. When I saw the movie it was better than I thought it was going to be. Its funny with out being stupid or dirty. And it had a clever way of modernly retelling Snow White. If you are in the mood for a good comedy that will leave you smiling, see this movie! The dorks were great and very funny,Amanda Bynes was hilarious as well, the prince was very charming, and Sara Paxton did a fair job also. Sure this movie will never win an Oscar but it a warm-hearted teen comedy that most people will love. This is an excellent modern retelling of Snow White.",/review/rw3360835/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2008,dbborroughs,6," Good retelling of Snow White with a a really good looking young lady in the lead
","Retelling of Snow White on a college campus as nerdy girl raised by construction workers goes to her dead mothers old college where she runs afoul of the sorority and is forced to take refuge with seven ""dorks"", uber geeks like herself. Cute family oriented movie isn't bad but is a bit too artificially constructed to be fully moving. Still I have to give any film that name checks Usagi Yojimbo as a badge of geekiness points. Wait for cable and watch it with rug rats (No pun intended).",/review/rw3360835/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2011,copperncherrio,3," Really?
","Not the most logical of movies, but in this one I didn't hate Amanda Byne's character. Is it perhaps, she's not annoying and manipulative or bloaty faced, whinny personality. Here, she's actually a less direct character, and quite likable. I'm not sure how I feel about her being a brunette, but good news it isn't bad. Sydney White is a modern play on Snow White, except instead of an evil step mother, Sydney deals with an evil sorority head, who gets mad at Sydney for slowly rising on Myspace's Hot or Not page as well as catching the attention of her ex- boyfriend.",/review/rw3360835/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2008,ssvfolder-1,5," charming yet not too bright
","OK, maybe it's just me but how many movies will demonstrate that being a loser is OK, and you will accomplish everything??? Being a loser or ""different"" does not often demonstrate your uniqueness but instead shows your complete inability to blend in. Don't get me wrong, fairy tales is nice and all, but what do we teach our kids - be weird, don't do anything useful with your life, don't communicate with anyone outside your extremely small weird circle - and you will get everything you dream of. Hell, If most kids of the next generation will act like that, than chaos and general degradation is in our future. The world belongs and always will to the strong, smart people with goals in mind. On the other hand this fairy tale is charming and nice and... quite frankly boring. People need to believe in something and if a religion is not an option for large portion of modern kids, than why not those fairy tales. If something I preferred the ""American pie - beta house"". Much nicer fairy tale that shows that not only money still rule our society. Still this is a cute movie to watch, just no one should really take it seriously.",/review/rw3360835/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2015,anaconda-40658,3," Watch Snow White Instead.
","Sydney White (2007): Dir: Joe Nussbaum / Cast: Amanda Bynes, Sara Paxton, Matt Long, John Schneider, Jeremy Howard: Modern day Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs where Sydney White goes to college only to be rejected and humiliated by a sorority and the acceptance she gains from seven underachievers. The Snow White touch is just a cover for a screenplay done a million times over and it hasn't improved here. Directed by Joe Nussbaum who does what he can with the familiar drivel. Amanda Bynes can be very funny and intelligent in the right material but here she is weighted down with the stupidity of bad screen writing. We know the drill and we also know that Bynes will prove much to many because she is rehearsing the same speech done by a thousand other actors in a thousand other equally bad films. Sara Paxton as the popular girl is a Xerox of several other characters. Matt Long is pitiful as the nice guy who falls for Bynes, and he is no different than any other idiot who got suckered into this type of role. Finally there is a cameo by John Schneider as Sydney's father. This is probably not the last time this story will surface but unless something changes then the appeal will remain the same much like a re-test by a student who didn't study the second time around. Rather than take its fairy tale clichés to new heights, it settles for another Xerox and it fails miserably. Score: 3 / 10",/review/rw3360835/?ref_=tt_urv
