31 March 2022,gortx,," Ti West's exploitation mash-up
","Ti West's movie really should have been called ""E"" for elevated. It sets itself up as a smart take on the slasher films of the 70s and early 80s. As a bonus, the film within a film has the filmmakers making an 'elevated' porn flick (as a bonus, actor Owen Campbell who plays the ""Director"" even looks a bit like Director Tobe Hooper).",/review/rw8106885/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2022,johannes2000-1,8," Nice old-fashioned horror-flick with some hefty gore.
","I liked it. It's a nice old-fashioned (flawlessly 70's styled) slasher horror-flick, with a fairly original premise. As in any comparable horror movie the motives for the killings are pretty farfetched, but who cares, when they are pictured so relentlessley gruesome, the gore here is definitely not for the tender-hearted. Another strong point is how the movie very gradually builds up the tension, this is a real slow burner, the apprehension of looming doom is palpable throughout the movie. This is helped by a strong direction, a very clever and inventive editing, and some great photography, see for instance the scene of one of the girls swimming in the lake, while... well, I won't give it away, but it's beautiful and hair-raisingly scary at the same time!",/review/rw8106885/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2022,tchitouniaram,3," What a great disappointment ...
","My expectations were quite high for this film ... After watching it , I just don't understand what's all the hype is about ? To call it mediocre is to make a compliment ! Slow , predictable , not very clever horror , which is not even a horror , just an unrealistic portrayal of mayhem based on sex... Highly not recommended !",/review/rw8106885/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2022,JoBloTheMovieCritic,5," X
","5/10 - while it was nice to see Brittany Snow on the big screen again after the Pitch Perfect movies and it continued Jenna Ortega's Hollywood takeover, this utterly bizarre, inconsistent, and incomplete attempt at a ""sexy slasher"" starts off strong but a few moments aside, becomes utterly laughable in the last 45 minutes.",/review/rw8106885/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2022,miles670,7," Strange, heartfelt, classic slasher
","I didn't know what to expect going into this movie. Some reviews said it was porn with some horror, some said it was a slasher B movie. Some said decent acting and a good gore fest.",/review/rw8106885/?ref_=tt_urv

",Not really a jump scare sort of deal and like if you read the little description about the movie it has all the spoilers in it already.,/review/rw8106885/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2022,aidanratesmovies,6," Nothing new here, but nothing bad either
","An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I'm quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.",/review/rw8106885/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2022,Leofwine_draca,3," A real yawner
","X (2022) is a recent horror from Ti West that feels like a homage to THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE complete with '70s trappings and grindhouse feel. The story is about the actors and crew of a low budget porn shoot heading to a remote cabin owned by a couple of oldsters. All goes well until nightfall, when murderous intentions arise and things soon turn into a night of terror. I hadn't liked West's CABIN FEVER 2 or HOUSE OF THE DEVIL and didn't expect to like this either, and - surprise! - I hated it.",/review/rw8106885/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2022,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,5," Overhyped. Doesn't live up to A24 other films.
","While I knew this film was presented as a slasher film going in, I had better expectations given it was an A24 Studios film. Despite some of the famous names in the cast, I wouldn't consider it good. Probably my least favorite from the A24 films. The film is made in the cinematography style of classic 1970s slasher films, but it holds back on the brutality with the females. I really wished A24 was above PC culture.",/review/rw8106885/?ref_=tt_urv

31 March 2022,preppy-3,7," Really strange horror film

18 April 2022,supermellowcali,3," Indecent slasher movie

18 March 2022,cadillac20,8," A Fun, Classically Styled Slasher
","Paying homage to the slashers of yesteryear is nothing new, but Ti West's new movie X makes it feel fresh. He does this by primarily bringing attention to the sex parts of the genre and exploring what sex means. This is, after all, in part about a crew of people attempting to make a porno. But the sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation. It is at the heart of the film, and West seems to be most interested in what the experience means, whether it's for love, a way to recapture youth, or getting the most out of life while one is still capable of experiencing the act.",/review/rw8106885/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2022,pietclausen,1," Another fake horror movie
","Instead of getting a horror movie of the 70's, you watch a group of junkies going to make a porn movie on a farm, which turns out to be nothing but a long drawn out build-up, before they get wiped out but one. Some people call it a slow burner, but they're wrong, it doesn't even get lit.",/review/rw8106885/?ref_=tt_urv

18 March 2022,UniqueParticle,9," Perfect slow burn
","A very stylish rendition of original porn leading to some brilliant horror set in 1979 that is well written and fun to watch! X is surprising in all the right ways and very weird reminds me of M. Nights The Visit just more extreme. I was surprised to see Sam Levinson's name in the credits I love him and his projects! Ti West created something special, I've seen a couple of his films he seems to gear towards disturbed older folks which is quite effective.",/review/rw8106885/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2022,Chi-C-Dawg,5," Overhyped and pretty dumb
",I can't with movies full of characters that just walk around without any instinct doing the absolute dumbest things they could possibly choose before they're murdered. It's literally the whole movie. The 'action and gore' is actually pretty tame. The sex is explicit. The characters are idiots.,/review/rw8106885/?ref_=tt_urv

","Ti West is back - I have to admit since we had a pandemic I didn't really think or realize he was gone. Something I only heard from others that this is his ""comeback"" piece. Again not how I view it, but nevermind that, enjoy this horror movie that also has a sexual tone to it ... and quite a lot of innuendo.",/review/rw8106885/?ref_=tt_urv

",This is a technically well-made movie. It's a slow burn but I was never bored. I was enjoying it and curious to see what comes next. Until it got weird. And gross. This is coming from someone who watches tons of horror and gore. That wasn't the problem. The gore is one of the movie's best qualities.,/review/rw8106885/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2022,vango_al,1," Hilariously awful
",People rating this 9 and 10. Did we watch the same movie? Its a hilariously bad slasher. Just the premise of it is enough to stay away from it. 6 adults get terrorized and murdered by a couple 90 year olds that can barely move. Yeah you read that right. Imagine not knocking out a 90 year old that moves with the speed of a turtle. Waste of time.,/review/rw8106885/?ref_=tt_urv
