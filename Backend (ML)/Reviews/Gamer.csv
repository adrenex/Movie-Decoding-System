15 March 2018,apjc,8," It's a nice feel good movie.
","If adults are going to review this film they should first ask what the children thought. Why some try to analyse these type of films is beyond me. It's old style fun and happy ending we all enjoyed as kids. If you don't have any, borrow one or two, because you'd have an excuse to enjoy a bit of fun. Don't want to bring up any religious connotations but I did fall in love with a goat.",/review/rw7121603/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2018,ghazaal-b,10," One of the bests
","I don't understand why the rating is this low here. It was one of the best animation movies I have seen. It has several layers to it. Surface layer is of course going against violence and advocating peaceful life and behavior. But it can have several other layers; like how the society forces boys to define themselves as ""masculine"" based on the norms of the society. Masculinity is more of a sociological construct rather than an eternal unchanging truth.
Some people here have said that this movie is not pro fighters. I totally think the opposite. It is advocating a new definition for fighting. Rather than violence, fighting according to Ferdinand is patience and perseverance. ",/review/rw7121603/?ref_=tt_urv

","First let me say my physically 37 year old but mentally 4 year old son (umbilical cord around neck cut off air at birth/brain damage) thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was a bit slow in the middle at one spot I thought, but generally entertaining for me as well. ",/review/rw7121603/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2020,kosmasp,8," Winning and other life goals
","This may not be a Pixar movie, but it still is worth your time. It has some wisdoms of life, tells you it is ok to break out of structures while growing up and finding yourself and other positive (I would call them that) messages. Of course this also has jokes about incest and death - though both well ""hidden"" inside jokes. So something for the adults to enjoy snickering about and something I reckon kids wouldn't get in its entirety.",/review/rw7121603/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2017,heatherr-29963,9," Enjoyable cute and heartwarming!
","It seems that some people think the jokes in this movie fall flat and there is too much unnecessary clutter, but I honestly really really loved this movie. It was a reluctant choice after not finding anything else playing that we wanted to see, but man am I glad we saw it!",/review/rw7121603/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2018,dreamsrepository,9," Silly MooMoo, heartwarming and funny!
","It may be a bit generic with a predictable plot and some clich√© characters. Some of the voice acting may be a bit jarring and the animation is simply OK. Still Ferdinand delivered humor and warmth in spades. I could not stop laughing! 
Even when the jokes were corny, the corniness fits right in with a soft-hearted, flower loving bull that wouldn't hurt a fly.",/review/rw7121603/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2018,benm-41751,7," Although it gets out of control, this is a funny movie with a heart
","Ferdinand is an over-the-top cartoony movie about a massive bull who's expected to be a fighter but only wants peace. It gets wildly energetic, sometimes to the point of being too much. The crazy goat, especially, is a really bizarre character that sometimes makes me laugh and sometimes just makes me uncomfortable. But if you're in the right mood and don't take it too seriously, there are some pretty silly and funny moments in the movie. Something I like too is that most of the characters, for all their quirks, have a moment of vulnerability. The few calm moments reveal a lovely message about putting down arms and soaking in the simple joys of life.",/review/rw7121603/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2018,scottshak_111,," A Pacifist's Tale in a Violent World
","Surprisingly a good movie! I would be honest with you. From the trailers, I didn't expect much from Ferdinand Movie. But I was wonderstruck when I actually saw it. Watching it become a powerhouse of emotions as the movie progressed, I knew I had been dead wrong. That a movie should not be judged by its trailer, just as no book should be judged by its cover.
Ferdinand movie didn't pack in as many jests as you find in animated movies nowadays, but it was a great entertainer nevertheless. It was successful in walking a tightrope of emotions. That's where its true strength lurked. When you focus on other parts critically you realize there were tons of issues strewn around the movie as well. But all of that can be overlooked once you become the bull the movie cashes in on, and try to empathize with that creature who doesn't share his dream based on his appearance, rather stands by his decision to see what others fail to.
Story and Characters
Not everyone is same. We have been wired differently. Whilst a father wishes to be something, his son might not share his dream. He might have a dream of his own. Everyone has a choice. That very fact forms the basis of Ferdinand movie.
You can't decide or judge someone by their size or appearance. What you can't see, their brain, in fact, holds the key to their vision.
Place that impactful storyline into animation and you have got an enjoyable hoot to savour. That's what Ferdinand does with its bull, the protagonist voiced by John Cena. He is an out of place animal who doesn't share other's dreams.
Bullfighting in Ferdinand Movie
Either you are a fighter, or you are meat.
What you might call as someone's dream is a brilliant mockery of materialism. In the movie, the dream of fellow bulls is to fight the matador. Whilst the bulls in the flick fail to see the pointlessness of it, (like all the people who consider bullfighting a sport) Ferdinand in his blatant sense of indifference towards the game, digs up the real truth behind it. They are all ending up getting slaughtered! Just as we had seen in Sausage Party, the blind followers are all prepping up to die.
Sure, you get to fight in a magnificent stage, but it's just another chop shop!
Ferdinand movie uncovers the ugliness that surrounds the sport in a way that will leave you teary-eyed.
Ferdinand is all about saving the meek, helping others. He is finding it hard to explain it to others why he is the way he is. Doesn't that chime in with life? I don't know, like your very own? How many times have you felt that way? As if you are in someone's else body, forced to live someone else's dream. Are you fighting for it?
It's good to see someone is. Ferdinand is willing to leave no stones unturned to make the world understand he is not like the others. He is different. Violence his not his place even though he has been bedecked with a body that leaves the onlookers marveling.
Look at your pecs! They are like two tiny bulls inside a bull.
But the world, being the world, judges Ferdinand by the way he looks and brands him as destructive.
A Glance at Life
Ferdinand is given a shot at identifying his life the way he wishes to live it. He finds it in a place right next to Nina voiced by Lily Day. That's where he wishes to be - In a patch of land where a bull is chosen over a dog, Nina teaches Ferd the Nerd what love is all about.
Is this love? I love love.
It's that taste of life that helps the bull in registering home - not where you are born but where you are supposed to be.
Deprived of the life he desires to lead, Ferdinand is picked up and dropped at Ground zero once again. He ends up in Casa del Toro, the place that he had escaped from, to be prepped up for bullfighting, something he is not cut out for. Unable to understand what the fuss is all about Ferd tries to escape a bull's fate, but ends up drawing himself closer to the inescapable sport. Lupe voiced by Kate McKinnon is one of those weird funny characters, who brings in most of the punches and stays close by.
El Primero (Miguel Angel Silvestre) is in search of a bull to fight his final fight. Marking Ferdinand as a perfect contender he awaits him in the center of all applause.
Even though the main villain brings that heightened sense of befitting contrast to Ferdinand's character, you realize it is a typical cliched build-up that you have often seen in countless movies in the past. El Primero might have reminded you of Anton Ego from Ratatouille if only he had better words to say. The screenplay of the flick, unfortunately, isn't impressive and hence framing him as a villain to remember is something you might want to reconsider.
The Final Showdown
What tears you apart is the final face-off that puts the bull against El Primero. While there's an imminent death written in the frames, the demeanor of the bull is enough to shatter you into pieces. The multitude is busy cheering the one with the sword, but they easily forget that the one fighting without is a true champion",/review/rw7121603/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2018,dallasryan,8," Loved the Overall Theme
","Ferdinand, in my opinion, was one of the more underrated animation films for 2017. Aesthetically Coco was better, but overall I liked Ferdinand better than Coco. I love what Ferdinand stood for and it's overall theme was true to the heart and very touching for all of humanity. ",/review/rw7121603/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2017,domtaylor,6," 'Ferdinand' is a fun family flick that explores some important themes, but ultimately succumbs to the generic story tropes that would be expected from a film of its kind.
","Although the story is fairly generic and the jokes mostly fall flat, 'Ferdinand' is still a entertaining family flick that somewhat stands out from the majority of recent animated films thanks to the important themes explored throughout, and its subtle commentary of the bullfighting sport. The film does, however, include a few overlong action set-pieces that drag down the pacing and seem to have only been included to keep hyperactive children engaged (although that is indeed their purpose), but luckily the film doesn't rely on these and instead focusses on delivering its principal ideals. Furthermore, the third act is emotionally powerful and nicely wraps up the character arcs on display, while really hammering home its message. John Powell's music score is fantastic too. 6/10",/review/rw7121603/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie is quite entertaining for all ages. My husband & I enjoyed it, I noticed my 12 year old laughing at parts, & my 3 year old twins sat through the entire movie without growing tired of it. I heard ""that's so funny mom"", from one of my three year old's a few times, and both laughed at many parts. Great family movie.",/review/rw7121603/?ref_=tt_urv

","In the shadow of the epic saga, there lies an animated field where flowers grow, birds sing, and bulls romp around smelling the fauna. No, I'm not drunk, I'm talking about Ferdinand the Bull, the latest kid's animated feature to stamped on to the silver screen. Blue Skies Studio has been advertising this film like crazy, in hopes of nabbing the younger audience this weekend. Yet with Disney knocking these films out of the park is there any hope for the other studios to put out quality work? Robbie K here happy to answer that question, as we hit yet another Robbie's movie review. ",/review/rw7121603/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2020,ricklb-43546,10," No-Bull This Movie Is Great!
","Heart felt scenes with just the right amount of silly loud humor. Sometimes children's movies are hard to judge because, kids are the targeted audience, and if they want loud obnoxious characters with no story plot, then most of the time it's what the studios give them, but not with this flick. Ferdinand has sweet characters and a hopeful outcome. The movie nicely references the Spanish bull fighting culture without making it harmful for children to see. Mostly happy to see a children's movie that doesn't promote violence and instead speaks out against it.",/review/rw7121603/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2021,Abdulxoxo,7," Nice message
","The central concept of having a bull that would rather smell flowers than fight isn't a bad idea for a kid's story as it promotes a sweet message. The main character as well as the supporting characters were likable. There were 3 German show horses in the field next to the bulls and these horses would act like they were superior to the bulls. At one point there was even a dance off between the horses and the bulls, which although completely unoriginal, it was funny. There was also a joke involving 3 hedgehogs and Spanish numbers, which was also hilarious. The most creative (although overly extended) joke was a sketch literally involving a bull in a china shop. These as well as some of the action scenes that were impressive. As well as Cena, I thought there was a pretty good supporting voice cast which they did good. Overall, Ferdinand is a fine movie with a nice message.",/review/rw7121603/?ref_=tt_urv

","""The Story of Ferdinand"" by Munro Leaf might be one of most well known children's stories written. The story is about a bull named Ferdinand who rather than fighting like the other bulls loves to smell the flowers under a tree and then accidentally finds himself in a bull fight. It was a simple story and I think it mostly translated well to the silver screen with Blue Sky Studios' newest animated release ""Ferdinand"". This film definitely has it's message stand out while also providing some pretty funny laughs. Here's why I think this movie works.",/review/rw7121603/?ref_=tt_urv

","The people that are giving bad ratings to this movie, I don't understand. Like maybe the killing part of the bull, but that's not what kids focus on. The story plot was amazing. The puns were a bit cringy, but that's what makes it funny! Their was a mix of character personalities, which made the movie good! The movie overall was great!

","3/21/18. What a wonderful animated movie for everyone. I really enjoyed myself watching Ferdinand, whose appearance belies a gentle animal who loves to smell the flowers more than anything else. All the characters were cute and my favorite was Kate McKinnon's Lupe, the calming goat with attitude. Lupe outdo Shrek's Donkey at every turn as the best sidekick any animal could ever have. Extras on the DVD makes it worth watching over and over. Catch this movie!",/review/rw7121603/?ref_=tt_urv

","Where do I start? If this movie doesn't touch your heart then I don't know what will? I left the cinema feeling full & warm after viewing Ferdinand. The plot is very simple but very clever. I like to see movies where they can teach the younger generation that being different is ok & having the strength and love to stick to what you believe no matter how much you're told different. That's what sort of movie Ferdinand is. It encourages the audience to thrive in what they believe. There's a lot of hope and not giving up on people, even the ones who treated you poorly, throughout this movie. I can't express enough how much you should take your children to see this. It's a beautiful watch with spectacular animation & characters. John Cena did a wonderful job on the voice of Ferdinand. Go watch it! It's wonderful!",/review/rw7121603/?ref_=tt_urv

","Everybody around you(Ferdinand) is a part of the same rat-race(Bull-fighting). The sick competition of bull-fighting limited all bull's life to binary options of winning or loosing. This movie clearly shows and influence you to think out of the box, as Ferdinand becomes the one and only to not being interested in bull-fighting at all.
