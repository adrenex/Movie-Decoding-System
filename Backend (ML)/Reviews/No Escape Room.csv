28 November 2018,Emus79,2," Makes no sense at all
","So the car of a father and daughter breaks down in a small eery village. Very cliché, but okay. They decide to spend some time in an escape room, which is recommended by a waitress at the local diner. Upon arrival they are immediately subverted in the story, together with 3 others, because that's absolutely normal and they don't have to pay or anything.",/review/rw6905290/?ref_=tt_urv

","Drinking game alert! Every time you hear the name ""Karen"" take a shot! Just kidding, do NOT do this, you will most likely get alcohol poisoning.",/review/rw6905290/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2018,csab-39797,," Could've been a good movie if it made sense!
","The concept is good and the ambiance adds a macabre feel but after that not much makes sense. 
Spoilers:
So the escape room house is in the middle of nowhere , they pull up but no cars in parking lot yet there are 3 other participants . Then the host is very odd and no one is sure if she's putting on an act. At that point why would people want to stay. 
At any rate there's a lot of odd happenings with little to no explanation as to what's going on. People disappear, die, go back in time anc the movie ends:/ I was actually irritated at the end because I was expecting the conclusion to bring it all together but it just confused me more.",/review/rw6905290/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2021,bartu99,5," Not SATISFIED!!
","In these kinds of movies the script is more important than acting and directing. I love escape room themed movies but this ones script is not good at all, it is weak. It increases your attention at first but at the end you cannot get what you wish for.",/review/rw6905290/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2018,Neptune165,2," Watched it today, it's terrible
","This movie make no sense at all what happened at the end for Andrew and who behind all this and where is The Inventor . for the first half it was good, then loses it way in unclear nonsense",/review/rw6905290/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2019,jenpaul-52235,6," Had potential
","Wasn't an awful movie, acting was decent and the idea was half there... My theory is the tea contained poison rather than a hallucinagen and everyone died from drinking the tea and was stuck in a limbo type place of constantly playing the game especially with the ambiguous ending... I like that it is quite open to interpretation.",/review/rw6905290/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2019,avacado-1,5," No escape Ending
","Okay. So the movie could have been better and what I figure happened was first of all the tea contained some sort of hallucinogen thereby explaining the painting that led to the lake with woman and chains and the other weird monster sounds and the one woman watching herself try to escape the room, etc. The ending when father and daughter are back in diner and then to car with yet another lock was them really still being in the game at the house tricking them to believe they escaped. They will NEVER escape and will spend the rest of their lives trying to survive the house.",/review/rw6905290/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2019,arcanjl,6," ... but didn't want to
","This received a lot of negative reviews. But I liked it (for horror). There left a lot to the imagination, and nothing was explained, but I didn't care. I like the idea, and loved the rooms they were in, and the horror was just an added bonus. If you like horror movies, this was a fun one to watch, didn't take itself seriously.",/review/rw6905290/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2021,ginasharp,6," Good but without an ending...
","I liked this movie but the ending (which doesn't really exist) kinda made it fall flat for me. The whole time it has u guessing what's going on and then there is never a ""pay-off"". Would have probably been a 10 for me if it had actually explained things. There is a mystery type character that never gets explained, this made the movie a non-recommend for me.",/review/rw6905290/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2019,petitefraise-67259,4," It never went anywhere
","I actually found this movie interesting at first...But as I watched it I realized there was absolutely NO story line. No explanation of how any of them got stuck. The acting was a bit questionable as well. I kept waiting for some sort of backstory about the house...still nothing. The ending was a bunch of BS. They were still stuck in the ""escape room"" and the Diner was in on it. This should have NEVER been made because it made no sense at all. I gave it a four for trying but I wouldn't waste my tome with this crap again.",/review/rw6905290/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2021,apryla-58795,5," Karen?! Ty?!
","So hmmm...I would explain this but sadly I can't. You all are on your own with this one. The acting was really bad. The girlfriend was super annoying with constantly yelling ""Tyler!!"" It's like she couldn't come up with anything else to say. The dad just walked around with his mouth open yelling ""Karen!"" Who names their kid Karen anymore? Too much time watching them walk around looking afraid but not doing anything. I kept saying ""C'mon! Let's get this going!"" Way too drawn out and nothing explained. Why did the other three die but yet the dad and daughter are still alive at the end? Also I thought this was a movie but it actually had pauses throughout so as to seem like it is actually a made for TV movie which added a level of extra hokey-ness. It could've been pretty good but it fell apart. Lastly is it just me or did Karen look just like Madeleine Petsch from Riverdale? They could be twins. It kept throwing me for a loop. Oh and by the way...what kind of idiots go to something like this and think it's normal not to fork over the cover charge? That should've been their first clue.",/review/rw6905290/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2018,laylan_salih,2," Don't waste your time
","I am no film pessimist but this film was honestly of poor standard. Initial plot was great, had some weight and somewhat believable. Midway through it then escalates Into being unrealistic and immediately I lost my respect. What is worse the ending doesn't even make sense that I even googled for a plot explanation for which I have come up empty handed. If anyone wishes to enlighten me as to what even happened at the end I would much appreciate it,

18 February 2021,jammies70,4," Wait, what???
","The movie started out OK. Seemed a bit cheesy, but that's to be expected from a lot of horror movies, right?
Decent premise of maybe there is more reality to this than just an escape room... maybe the plot is a true story. But then the movie takes a weird twist and completely loses me. After a while, it makes absolutely no sense, and became a total disappointment.",/review/rw6905290/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2021,Sobertoaster-764-479561,3," I knew this would have a bad ending...
","It all goes out the window as soon as any kind of time travel garbage is introduced, just an excuse for it to make zero sense anymore. It completely goes out the window the last half hour or so. Wow what a trash ending.
It started fun enough and I was interested.",/review/rw6905290/?ref_=tt_urv

6 May 2020,chrissy_a-87011,4," Not the best, but also not the worst
","Overall the film had its gripping moments, but I can't wrap my head around the fact someone decided to write and produce a movie that makes no sense at all. My guess is that it was supposed to leave you hanging with a bunch of possibilities, but instead I was left with a bit of a headache and some mild frustration.",/review/rw6905290/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2018,gloopy-45239,6," Can't make my mind up
","This was okay in my opinion, not great but better than some titles of this genre out there.The ending left me wondering, is it a concept these days, we have ran out of ideas, so lets just end it at that.Its a watchable film and like alot of others, could have been so much better, if the ending was more wow.Enjoy it, don't enjoy it, everyone of us is different",/review/rw6905290/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2019,asanders-45342,5," watch again? no. recommend to others? yes
","Ugh okay so i honestly enjoyed watching this movie. i personally didn't think it was too predictable and it left me wondering what's going to happen next. my only complaint is that there wasn't any resolution at the end. i still don't know what everything meant and what the heck was happening in the movie. i would recommend it to others JUST to hear their theories on the movie and plot.
i think i'd feel a lot better about the movie if there was a sequel of the main characters before they went to the escape room. it felt like there were a lot of holes in the plot and things that were meant to be important to the plot, but made no sense to the viewer! the acting wasn't the best but it was more than decent. i could rate it between a 4 and a 6 so i just chose 5.
if you're just looking for an entertaining movie, i recommend. if you like movies that make sense and come to a proper conclusion at the end, this one is not for you.",/review/rw6905290/?ref_=tt_urv

",I will keep this short....the movie never makes sense even to the end. It does not answer any questions nor let you know what is real and what is not.,/review/rw6905290/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2019,brenda-htun,1," Don't waste your time by watching this movie.
","There is a lot of horror cliché thingy happening in the movie and in the end the writer don't have any idea how to connect the dots and explain why these things are happening so the writer decided to just end it without explaining the reasons and end the movie . And there it is -u wasted your time (1hr 25min). I should suggest to put sth like ""congratulations, u have sucessfully wasted 1hr and 25 mins"" in

5 November 2018,Rettadm4,1," Ugh, Stupid

23 October 2018,schofieldius,3," Pretty bad even for a tv movie
","I'm only giving this a 3 instead of a 1 because it's a tv movie and I feel I should be less critical. It tried too hard to do a lot. But it's just weird and silly in the end. A house with a ghost, time loops and temporal shifts. And dodgy acting. Did have some good suspense which was lost due to sheer silliness",/review/rw6905290/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2021,lighterthanair-82569,4," Watchable but not great
","One of those movies you'll never watch again but it wasn't horrible. As noted in other reviews, not particularly coherent nor clever, but the acting was ok and I was curious to see how the ending played out, which is a good Indication. Not that the ending was satisfying, which it wasn't, haha. Not a bad choice if nothing else is available.",/review/rw6905290/?ref_=tt_urv
