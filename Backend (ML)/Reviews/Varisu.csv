5 September 2019,brett-76260,10," Just a fantastic show..
","First off i am definitely not the demographics this show was trying to capture. I am a United States Marine and I really don't think the writers had a guy like me in mind. All I can say is I'm so glad I took the time to watch this show. I absolutely loved it and have now watched the series twice. Its not action packed or anything like that. It is all about the writing and the characters. Just brilliant from start to finish and is a show the entire family can watch together. Maggie Smith if you ever read these comments just know you played my favorite character out of any series I've ever watched. You made this show absolutely perfect! If you are debating on whether or not to give this show a try take it from me, you wont want the show to ever end...",/review/rw2489287/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," Beautifully produced, and for me one of the better programmes airing this year
","I have to say I loved Downton Abbey, and thought it was one of the better programmes airing this year along with Luther, Sherlock and the stunning Channel 4 drama Mo. Downton Abbey was beautifully produced, well cast and interesting, when it was first advertised it looked as though ITV had a hit and from the first episode I think Downton Abbey lived up to that expectation.",/review/rw2489287/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2011,Doylenf,9," Brilliant, stylish, clever entertainment with witty script...
","DOWNTON ABBEY is the kind of ""Masterpiece Theatre"" material that the British do with such finesse that one can only sit back and marvel at the sets, costumes, music, and above all, the performances that are all on an extraordinarily high level.",/review/rw2489287/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2011,jlpicard1701E,10," Outstanding series, leaves you to want for more...

",What can i say? Since I saw the first season I've been an unconditional fan of Downton Abbey. I think it's one of the most historically accurate and refined series of recent years.,/review/rw2489287/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2021,botimarci,10," Maggie Smith is a wonderful actress
","I can't hold this back. I enjoyed every moment Maggie Smith was on scene. I was a bit sceptical in the beginning, but her performance is simply stellar. I laughed out loud alone at home watching her unique moments in the show. This is simply not comparable to anything I saw before in any other shows or movies. She is a treasure.",/review/rw2489287/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2011,skillswordfish,10," Rare treasure!
","I'll agree that the British know how to do period drama better than anyone (certainly better than us Americans) and this is no exception. You'll be captivated immediately and hours will go by before you realize you've spent an entire afternoon in front of your television set. The relationships built between all characters of this show are what tie it up in a nice, fluffy (although not always pretty) bow. Brilliantly written and set in lush, vibrant surroundings with detailed costuming, this drama series should set the bar for others. No busy dialog or wasted scenes, just good, solid craftsmanship in every episode of this poignant family story. You'll do well to invest in seasons 1 and 2. Looking forward to the arrival of season 3!",/review/rw2489287/?ref_=tt_urv

11 August 2014,SnoopyStyle,9," Addictive soap opera
","The show starts in April 1912 with the news of the sinking of the Titanic. Robert Crawley, Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville) has no son and the heir is on board. The new heir is distant cousin Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) who is a small Manchester lawyer. The easiest solution is to push oldest daughter Mary (Michelle Dockery) onto the new heir. Sibling rivalry can be cruel on plain middle daughter Edith (Laura Carmichael). The youngest Sybil (Jessica Brown Findlay) is sweet and independent. The staff working downstairs is led by Mr. Carson (Jim Carter). Mr. Bates (Brendan Coyle) suffers a leg injury from the Second Boer War and is hired by Robert Crawley. Thomas (Rob James-Collier) and Miss O'Brien (Siobhan Finneran) the villains of the downstairs world. The upstairs and downstairs worlds of Downton Abbey is changed over the years.",/review/rw2489287/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2011,fudge_factory,10," lovely!
","OK so I'll admit, Downton isn't a academic study of social change, nor is it entirely original ( let's be honest) - but it doesn't pretend to be! ",/review/rw2489287/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2014,Dr_Coulardeau,10," Only British TV can reach that level of TV art
","The first thing to be said about this series is that it is British from the very first scene to the very last by the vast range of actors and actresses as for age and the extreme quality of these actors, most of them having parallel careers in theaters, television and the cinema. They are thus able to act with a vast variety of stances and tones and at the same time with a great expressivity on their faces or with their body language. Within that great versatility and mental or dramatic agility there is not one single age that is privileged and the older generation is just as good and as present as the youngest one and the age range, apart from the few children, goes from the late teens and early twenties to the seventies. This is exceptional and no American series will ever be able to do that. A TV actor might turn up in the cinema but then he will never go back to TV, and both will hardly be able to work on a stage. The case of ""Harry Potter,"" or Daniel Radcliffe if you prefer, is typically British who can play on the stage or act in a film. That mobility is not American, and American television sure misses something there, just as much as it misses the use of older actors and actresses, as well as very young ones, leveling the cast within a twenty to thirty years age bracket.",/review/rw2489287/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2011,gradyharp,10," Mesmerizing Examination of Class Distinction
","DOWNTON ABBEY is one of the things the British do best. This seven part series has it all - crisp dialogue, stunning settings/scenery/costumes, an all-encompassing view of class distinction not only between the upper class or gentry versus the middle class (who often have as much money but come into via labor versus inheritance) but also among the servant class, and a cast of many of the finest British actors before the public. Julian Fellowes is in fine form here as the writer, taking on a story about 1912 England and the microcosm of Downton Abbey, a mansion and grounds run by the elegant Robert Crawley, Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville), his mother Violet, the Dowager Countess of Grantham (Dame Maggie Smith at her best), and Cora Crawley Countess of Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern0 - the moneyed American whom Robert married in order to retain the Abbey and their daughters, Ladies Mary (Michelle Dockery), Edith (Laura Carmichael) and Sybil (Jessica Brown Findlay). Much of the story revolves around the problem of inheritance (entailment) as the heirs apparent to the Abbey are victims of the Titanic disaster that opens the story. The Abbey must be passed on to a monied heir and the hunt is on. ",/review/rw2489287/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2011,robapacl,10," Completely captivating
","I was hooked after the first five minutes and come heaven, hell or high water, I was going to see Downton Abbey twice, the second time to pick up the points which I knew would be too fast, and possibly convoluted, to follow the first time round. I have watched Masterpiece since the inaugural with Alistair Cooke, and I can't remember anything as engaging and entertaining as this. As a cousin of an English family with deep affection for the monarchy and respect for the aristocracy, my perspective is an odd mix of Democratic ideals, old-time Republican values and curiosity about and appreciation of the social structure which prevailed so long in England. Downton Abbey appears to present a very balanced depiction of the social, political, economic and historical forces which drove the lives and fortunes of the classes and produced strange and almost incomprehensible behavior to comply with an unwritten, all-pervasive code. I am completely fascinated by the events and reactions and what would appear to be almost puppet-like behavior on occasion. I pray for a sequel.",/review/rw2489287/?ref_=tt_urv

10 July 2011,onepotato2,2," Soapy dishwater
","If you thought Gosford Park needed to be a shallow, episodic TV series, you might enjoy this. Even Maggie Smith (and her character) has been borrowed wholesale to ease your transfer. And what luck, the theme music is a thinly veiled knock-off of the title music from The Piano. But Gosford Park wrestled with matters of substance, and showcased some striking film technique.",/review/rw2489287/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2013,TxMike,," Begins in 1912 as the Titanic is sinking.
","This British TV series has gotten lots of attention here in the USA for the past season or two, I've only heard vague things about it, including some buzz that it had won some awards. So today, being a slow day in Southern Texas, cool and rainy, I looked into it and lo, I beheld that Netflix has the first season, 7 episodes, available for streaming on demand. So I took the plunge. I watched the first episode, approximately 65 minutes, and immediately watched the second, approximately 45 minutes.",/review/rw2489287/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2016,Catharina_Sweden,7," Competent and educating but (almost) never exciting
","I am not as over the top about this series as the rest of the world seems to be. There is no doubt that it is a very competent work with high production values and an enormous budget. But I never felt any ""love"" for any of the characters, and I never felt that desire that you can feel when a work of fiction is really, really good, to be part of it and live in that world there with them.",/review/rw2489287/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2014,MissSimonetta,5," Entertaining enough
","There are Downton devotees and there are people who think it's a second-rate soap opera praising the oppressive class system of days of old. I'm in the middle ground: I like the show, but I cannot for the life of me comprehend the 8.8 rating it has on this website.",/review/rw2489287/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2012,grendelkhan,9," A wonderful series that should never be taken at face value.
","I will admit upfront I was more than a bit dismissive about Downton Abbey upfront. It sounded like another attempt at recreating Upstairs, Downstairs. I knew of the pedigree of Julian Fellowes, having watched and enjoyed Gosford Park. The acting and writing were first rate there, but I found much of it to be overly romantic about a system designed solely to benefit the privileged. In Gosford Park, that world is the setting for a mystery,; here, it's a soap opera (ok, drama). Doesn't sound appealing to a firmly middle class American revolutionary,does it? And yet, it is.",/review/rw2489287/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2020,santurcedc,10," I Am Loving The Series Downton Abbey
","I heard so much about Downton Abbey over the years and I never watched this series until recently. All episodes are currently playing on Amazon Prime Videos. My favorite characters are Thomas Barron and Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham. However, racism existed in England in the 1920's. A black man looking or dancing with a white woman would end up like Emmett Till. Gary Carr is not an American black actor. They should have cast a more attractive light skin black actor like Matthew Law for the part of Jack Ross. Overall, the series is outstanding. I love the British actress, Maggie Smith.",/review/rw2489287/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2011,reynolds-dale,10," A satisfying social drama presaging the changes upcoming in pre-WWI Britain.
","Julian Fellowes' intelligent (and sophisticated) take on pre-World War I society of aristocrats and worker-bees is smart-writing on the changes we will see over the next 25 years, encompassing two major wars and a great depression. The writing and the casting make this many steps above ""soap opera"" as the themes of social mobility and aristocratic incompetence are sharply etched.",/review/rw2489287/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2011,lorriebeauchamp,," Well done period piece
","This is beautifully filmed, with authenticity and societal values inherent in both script and acting. The story weaves in and out of two layers of society -- the masters and the servants -- giving us glimpses into the power struggles occurring on each level, and the colourful characters who inhabit both. I particularly enjoy seeing the large-scale production involved in taking care of a household of this magnitude, and the care taken with all the details. Given today's rapid pace, it's almost peaceful to watch this deliberately slowed pace, and to get a genuine sense of what it was like to be an estate-owner in this period. Housemaids who gossip, independent young men who don't appreciate the butler's code of honour, catty women and genteel sophisticates all combine to make this a very enjoyable romp among the rich of yesteryear!",/review/rw2489287/?ref_=tt_urv
