15 April 2021,cscott2331,10," I tried to wait until they all aired...
","...but I couldn't. This series is great. The subtle humor and great one liners have really done it for me. I love Ray Ramono too. I wasn't 100% on the Hazel(Cristin Milioti) until the second episode, but her facial expressions and comedic timing are spot on. All in all this is a great show. Unique storyline with some comedic heavy hitters. Bennett (Caleb Foote) I saw a few years back in a comedy series that never took off but I loved him in that and I love him in this. I can't wait to see where this series takes us from here. I hope it's to another season. I have really enjoyed this so far, with only 2 episodes to go.",/review/rw6776141/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2021,irenelaf,7," Season 1 is weirdly fun
","Sometimes a show that doesn't take itself too seriously and is weirdly (sci-fi) fun is entertaining escape from stress. The 3 main characters, Hazel, Byron, Hebert do some really good acting...that made a huge difference in making up for the few cheesy parts (most of the scenes with the nun). I laughed it off or didn't care about it and just let myself be entertained!",/review/rw6776141/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2021,midnitepantera,6," Interesting and weird, love Ray's gal! ;D
","This caught me off guard, it was a fun and twisted little watch with some funny and sweet moments. But the idea of that being done without consent to someone is frightening to think of, considering all those thirsty social media gals who would have been happy to let this be done to them with their consent. Worth a watch if you want something different than the usual tv fare. :D.",/review/rw6776141/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2021,samratsingraur,8," Quality writing with an amazing cast.
","Hazel's (Cristin Milioti) escape narrative has huge caper energy, but Made for Love has mysteries within mysteries, and they unfold in ways that are alternately exciting, astounding, and creepy. Milioti is the clear standout among an already impressive cast. Even when the deliberately scattered storytelling wears a little thin, she holds our attention with no trouble. Billy Magnussen's Byron Gogol is also delightfully, terrifyingly unhinged. The only thing wrong with this show is its pacing. Otherwise the outstanding cast gives us more than enough reason to keep coming back for those answers and makes Made for Love a solid installment in the techno-dystopic rom-com genre.",/review/rw6776141/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2022,bosporan,8," All is not what it seems - a subtle sledgehammer
","Cristin Milioti plays the charismatic, yet acerbic Hazel in this creative non-linear story about the ethics of technology, agency and relationships. It is an extended Black Mirror episode, a union of The Collector (movie) and Upload (TV series), presented with a cynical, sinister core wrapped in flippant humour.",/review/rw6776141/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2022,rdoubleoc,10," GREAT show, especially so far.
","Neat concept and story. It's sort of like Amazon's Upload series, but I actually liked this better (or just as much, at least). The plot and feel of the series is a lot more realistic, in my opinion.",/review/rw6776141/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2022,whatithinkis,10," My rating for Season 1 was/is a 10
","Season 2 is even better. I'm stunned by the originality, subtlety, skill of the writing. Don't get me started on the acting, directing, sets, camera work. This thing is amazing.",/review/rw6776141/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,heidibokor,7," Quirky and Fun
","I knew nothing about this show when I started the first episode. I have to say it's quirky, weird, and fun. It has some funny scenes especially when the main character knows her creepy husband is watching. The episodes are not long. Worth the watch if you want to drown out the crazy world and just watch something fun.",/review/rw6776141/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2021,owen-watts,7," Manufacturing Consent
","This fascinatingly obtuse series adapted by the novelist Alissa Nutting from her own book has a vibe hovering somewhere between Black Mirror and Veep - about a woman escaping a seriously problematic relationship with tech billionaire and thinly-veiled allegorical caricature Byron Gogol. Not all of it works, it gets increasingly cluttered over the second season and some plot threads straight up dissolve away but the unsettling vibe and an incredibly strong cast lend it some serious weight. As a narrative reflection of contemporary issues around technology, assent and control it's super intriguing - as a straight up story it feels a little cold and lacking, the two combined make it a weird bit of TV that may genuinely end up having more to say in ten or twenty years than it does now.",/review/rw6776141/?ref_=tt_urv

7 April 2021,OGmacadamia39,10," Future Fantastic
","Honestly, there are a lot of negative reviews about this so far and I don't get it. I believe the writers have taken a great premise, put some fantastic actors into the right roles and created a super unique series.",/review/rw6776141/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2021,UniqueParticle,9," Brilliant less disturbing version of Black Mirror
","I really like how futuristic and wild Made for Love is! Christian Milioti is magnificent to watch throughout. I've been meaning to watch this series for a little while glad I finally did. I love the quote on a wall of episode 1 ""Every morning wake up on the wrong side of capitalism""! I'm sure there's plenty of genius bits and metaphors.",/review/rw6776141/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2021,random-70778,," Pacing is not jus a bit of a problem, it is mind numbing. Dark humor gets dropped for a creepy vibe
","I've seen the first four episodes. My guess is the other reviewer has seen just the first episode. I don't think the pacing is a bit of a problem, but deeply flawed and makes for an unenjoyable experience. Also the show dropping the viewer into the middle of the timeline and going forward and backwards comes as an artificial and compensatory gimmick that makes a mess of the narrative. (that is not a spoiler it is obvious in the first 30 seconds)",/review/rw6776141/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2021,lusciousmuffins,5," Interesting concept, poorly executed
","The concept for this show had a lot of potential; alas, most of that potential is squandered with poor execution.",/review/rw6776141/?ref_=tt_urv

29 June 2021,cherold,7," entertaining series with a poor season 1 ending (spoilers at end marked)
","I was hesitant to start watching this, because I was afraid it would be like the domestic-violence-themed horror movie Invisible Man, in which a woman's life is methodically destroyed by a controlling psychopath. At the same time, one of the creators of this series did Maniac, so there was also a chance it would be weird and quirky and fun.",/review/rw6776141/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2021,julieshotmail,7," Ray Romano steals it
","While I immensely enjoy every scene Ray Romano is in (7 stars for his funny self), I find this entire series a bit messy. The idea that this is a fusion of comedy, drama, science fiction, and horror is a cop-out. It seems that it just does not know what it wants to be, and that's how this show begins to break down. Different subplots, scenes, and characters seem disjointed; there is no cohesive theme, therefore you are left wondering, what exactly is the point?",/review/rw6776141/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2021,sydnee_man,7," I had high hope for this one.
","This show is trying to do too much. It's hard to tell if it's a ""technology domination"" show, a ""spousal control"" show a ""corporate greed"" show or a ""unrequited love"" show. It also tries to be quirky by throwing in random weird stuff, like sex dolls and bull riding competitions. I've only seen the first 3 episodes but I don't have high hopes for the others because there's no solid point of view and I don't really care what happens to any of these people.",/review/rw6776141/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2022,rpotter-07020,9," Enjoyed Season 1 but Season 2 is even better
",I thought season 1 was entertaining but a little uneven. Season 2 was a home run beginning to end. So I would give Season 1 a 7.5 and season 2 a 10. Overall about a 9.,/review/rw6776141/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2021,angelcorrea,10," Should be an 8 or at least close to
","Some people seem to forget this is a dramedy or a dark comedy (however you want to call it) and of course it has some flaws, but you can't expect a super well written Sci-Fi drama, cause it isn't intended to be one.",/review/rw6776141/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2021,davidfitzhugh,10," Maybe my favorite new series...
","This might be my favorite new series. It's hilarious, creative, and deep all at the same time. The humor is offbeat and sharp, not to mention really dark. The writing is on point and well thought out. The entire production is visually beautiful, every single scene is artistic. The music is killer, the acting is flawless, and the CGI is dope AF. I never thought I would be able to enjoy a show with Ray Romano, due to his previous roles. But this, I like. This is the kind of series I could watch over and over again.",/review/rw6776141/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2021,antrikshnarang-439-890558,9," Better than it seems.

17 April 2021,MnemonicDevice,3," Great premise, awful writing
","I'm giving this show three stars because it has a great premise, a decent cast, and good production values. The problem is that the writing is so bad that all of that potential is completely squandered. After getting off to a solid start in the first couple episodes, this series quickly pulls a Vasa and founders before really even sailing out of the harbor. This is the kind of show where the writers feel the need to have the main character explicitly describe the obvious thematic parallels between her dysfunctional marriage and her father's relationship to his Real Doll because, I guess, they don't think their audience can figure it out on their own. It seems to desperately want to be a biting satire, but it has no teeth, no wit, no understanding of technology or even, it seems, of human beings. There's a certain extent to which it also seems to want to be about the characters, but despite the best efforts of some of the performers, these people barely exist in the two dimensional plane. Seemingly significant characters hang around for a couple episodes then vanish with no consequence to the overall story, or they show up late in the season and do virtually nothing. By contrast, an inordinate amount of time is spent on scenes between the psychopathic husband and his assistant without any character development for either. It seems pointless. If the writers just want them to be the archetypes of the villain and toady, they should just go for that and spare their audience the tedium of their endless unnecessary scenes together. To a certain extent, those three stars I'm giving this are actually more damning than zero stars because, honestly, there is so much potential here that it seems like it would be nearly impossible to screw it up, yet somehow these writers succeeded.",/review/rw6776141/?ref_=tt_urv

3 April 2021,daviddas9999,6," A long, familiar Black Mirror episode
","I was hoping for something new, but up until episode 3 it is a Black Mirror story. And normally 1 episode is enough to get the idea of the use of technologie going wrong. I like Cristin Milioti acting and Billy Magnussen plays a creepy guy. But the tech idea is not enough for a tv series. So I hope new elements will be added the following episodes, if not, i have seen enough.",/review/rw6776141/?ref_=tt_urv
