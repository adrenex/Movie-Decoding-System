25 August 2018,bettinagh-51115,9," Instincts paid off
","I will never understand what posessed me to stick with a show that starts out with three selfish, neurotically cynical and sexually dysfunctional leads, but I did and it really paid off. Casual is a beautifully written series, aside from great dialog and storytelling, the character arcs, both within each season and overall are masterful. The show's direction is nicely cohesive, with each episode's director clearly chosen for that particular episode according to style, emphasis & content. The cast has teriffic chemistry, particularly between the three principals. ",/review/rw3348142/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2019,SnoopyStyle,7," casually funny
","Valerie (Michaela Watkins) is a tired therapist divorcing her husband Drew who is going with a younger woman. She and her teenage daughter Laura Meyers (Tara Lynne Barr) are living at her single brother Alex Cole (Tommy Dewey). Alex created a dating app but his own program cannot find him a real match. Valerie decides to have an one night stand with Leon (Nyasha Hatendi). Instead, Alex befriends Leon as his own permanent friend. Leia (Julie Berman) is Valerie's secretary.",/review/rw3348142/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2017,dccvc,7," Predictable Cynicism
","I really liked some of the jokes about modern romance, which hit home far better than most shows can manage. The writers on this show are clearly skilled in their craft. But I can't give this show the great reviews everybody else is throwing around. ",/review/rw3348142/?ref_=tt_urv

",The first season of this show was pretty funny and I devoured it. Eventually it kinda fades into the typical dysfunctional family drama but I still enjoyed the characters. Decent show.,/review/rw3348142/?ref_=tt_urv

28 November 2020,bewerekitten,5," The main character is mentally still a child
","She has all these wild expectations of the people around her like she is still a toddler mentally yet somehow she is a therapist who is supposed to be helping others...if her boyfriend who is struggling with sex addiction doesn't want to go to pound town in the middle of a house party she gets mad and thinks he doesn't love her?!?! I don't think she helps a single person the whole series... Unbelievably narcissistic and unlikeable...her poor daughter has to struggle to raise herself and her mother and her mother's bother at only 17 years old, she is the real star of the show but she doesn't get the screen time she deserves",/review/rw3348142/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2019,brenswee,6," Fantastic start but by the end of it all... A bit of a mess.
","I loved the first season which I would have rated an 8. The rating had to come down though for the remaining seasons - the decline was slow but real. I loved each of the three main characters to begin with, but Alex just started to drive me crazy and become really unlikeable in the subsequent seasons, esp 3 and 4. I was not rooting for him at all.
Talk about an attention seeking narcissist!
Similarly the daughter became as dull as dishwater as the series progressed. What made me see it all through until the end was the wonderful Michaela Watkins. I find her performances are always nuanced and her timing is fantastic (I know a lot of comic timing may be down to directors/editors etc, but I'm giving her credit).
In conclusion, while I was watching the series finale, I was really itching for the episode to end so that I could leave the series behind me, a series which was only a shadow of its original self.",/review/rw3348142/?ref_=tt_urv

11 July 2017,lunga,8," A good show you shouldn't miss.
","Casual stars Michaela Watkins and Tommy Dewey as Valerie and Alex, two adult siblings and Tara Lynne Barr as Valarie's daughter. All three actors are excellent in their respective roles and the writing is top notch. What I think is throwing some off, myself included, is the fact that the characters are not that nice. They are selfish, sometimes arrogant, and superficial, but along the way, we learn to forgive them because they are so damaged. Explanation of plot and characters would be irrelevant as it is a multi story-line arc, so just watch the show.",/review/rw3348142/?ref_=tt_urv

","Thought I had reviewed this before? Well if not now I'm like 3 seasons in and these people are the the most unlikable soul suckers I've ever seen. They're toxic! I feel the brother is an idiot and the sister thinks he needs her, isn't functional but he completely is ( he birthed a multi million dollar company for crying out loud! They're all obnoxious takers that need therapy( tho funny the lead's a therapist). Tho it is watchable ( tho a train wreck) Why Leon keeps coming at their beckon call tho is a joke. I'm not sure i'll continue if I find something worth while.. Oh. And I think there's genetic sexual attraction going on here as well...",/review/rw3348142/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2015,Luluhalabaloo,7," Huh, so that's why I can't date anymore...
","At first glance, the show is full of selfishness, narcissism, and psychopathy. The ""selfie"" generation. At a deeper level, it is a commentary on the state of parenting and socialization; actually, the lack thereof. ",/review/rw3348142/?ref_=tt_urv

2 December 2015,bjarias,8," ..it's good.. now lets just hope it gets the chance to stay around past S2
","Most guys just wanna be Leon.. hanging out, waiting on the sidelines until beautiful women are brought to their doorstep time and again. It's overall a pretty good show.. casting, acting (luv Eliza Coupe), script writing, production values all very good. And it feels nothing like your average half-hour Hollywood sitcom. This one gets most all right.. that's not to say it will be around a long time, because guarantees are the exception when it comes to American audiences. Some stuff runs for years that by all rights isn't worth much.. while at the same time shows like this one struggle to gain popularity. Best just to enjoy it while we can and hope it stays around for an extended run beyond the announced 13 episode second season.",/review/rw3348142/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2018,simonperry-79281,9," Loved it..
","Just finished the final episode on Amazon. Found myself genuinely moved, have grown to really like the characters and be interested in how things turned out. I guess the point about such polarising reviews is that you either like something or you don't. And that's ok. Just strongly suggest you give it a try and see which camp you fall into.",/review/rw3348142/?ref_=tt_urv

16 May 2021,davidbayjp,8," The show that gets better from season 3
","Rare to see a show start off slow and get significantly better in seasons 3 and 4. The funny one liners kept me watching initially since the story landed as superficial and cliche. But the actors, funny one liners, and unique scenes kept improving over time. They found some kind of perfect formula in seasons 3 and 4.",/review/rw3348142/?ref_=tt_urv

10 December 2017,mekjd,7," Circular Emotional Oddysey
","Characters are very well portrayed and interestingly all the more enjoyable for having all their flaws front and center. A great rejoinder to hippies and yuppies who did not let having children interfere with their drugging and promiscuity, and yet who seemed to maintain their wealth and pomposity with nary a touch of shame. Son and daughter try to make some sense of life, with mixed results. Mostly looking for love in...you know the rest.",/review/rw3348142/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2022,andymhancock,7," Everybody in the show behaves like a train wreck
","Want to see the worse in humanity? This show ""casually"" dishes it out as it was normal ... Their foils aren't even interesting -- just pathetic. However, the dramatic enactment is engagement, but only up to a point. Specifically, up to episode 10 of season 1. There's only so much you can watch people behave like ignorant self-absorbed sub-humans, then it doesn't matter how good the acting or drama is. Somehow, every single character is disrespectable, even the teacher (who makes adult decisions, but really mistreats people unnecessarily in doing so).",/review/rw3348142/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2015,davidjabad,8," Unexpected Surprise!
","I stumbled upon this show in a desperate attempt to find something entertaining and exciting to watch but also saw a familiar face, actor Tommy Dewey, who I also recognized as Mindy Lahiri's ex-boyfriend from The Mindy Project, also part of the main cast. I will admit that the pilot initially threw me off, leaving me a bit confused as to what the show was all about. I then followed this with seeing what IMDb had to say and stumbled on a negative review which made me write-off this show... until now. Having watched all five current episodes, it wasn't until I finished the second episode that I immediately disposed of my original thoughts and found out that this show was everything I was hoping it would be...Just needs some time to get used to in my case.
