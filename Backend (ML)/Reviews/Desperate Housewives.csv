","I watched Desperate Housewives for the first time ever out of sheer boredom and I ended up binging the entire series. It got me hooked from the first episode. Something crazy is always happening but at the core, this is a story about friendship and growth. There are some seriously funny moments mixed into all the chaos and many heartfelt ones too. I actually got emotionally during the last episode. It felt like the last episode of Friends. I had grown attached to all of these women and their families and didn't want it to end.",/review/rw7783648/?ref_=tt_urv

","The time Desperate Housewives came into advertising moments at Studio23 it didn't catch my attention immediately. I thought it was just one of the usual drama series that inadvertently attracts the attention of any melodramatic viewers, however I was totally wrong with my primary impression, it wasn't dramatic at all, comedy and puzzling twist where one of its successful magnetism that will always keep you hanging at the edge of your seats.

21 February 2005,TruPretender,," Look east, look west, look up and down! Its Susan, Bree, Lynette, Gabrielle, and Edie!
","Here it is! The best show to hit the prime time dial in years! Teri Hatcher, Marcia Cross, Felicity Huffman, Nicolette Sheridan, and James Denton create the most bizarre and un believably satirical world of Wisteria Lane, a beautiful neighborhood with beautiful woman, each lives the perfect life...on the outside! Matching ""American Beauty"" with ""Melrose Place"", this fresh, raunchy, and intelligent show revolves around four women who begin uncovering a series of mysteries when their best friend commits suicide. Susan Mayer(Teri Hatcher) is a Striking, chirpy woman with a beautiful daughter and a great romance with Mike Delfino(James Denton), but her flaw of natural klutziness gets her in trouble. Hatcher is irresistibly funny, and brings hysterics to the screen. Bree Van De Camp(Marcia Cross) is the stereotypical ""Stepford"" wife who brings jealousy to the most sweetest of ladies with her perfect life, blue flowers, smart kids, and exceptional marriage...RIGHT! Her life consists of struggling to retain her marriage, or lack there of. Her children hate her most of the time, and her husband can't stand her perfection. Cross is remarkably powerful in performance, and displays witty charm, and howlingly hilarious reactions to the events surrounding her. Not to mention being gorgeous beyond belief! Lynette Scavo(Felicity Huffman) gets the most sympathy from us as the successful woman, on her way to becoming the most powerful woman in business, and then pregnancy after pregnancy takes it all away. Now, she struggles with the most out-of-control children in television history, and a husband who just doesn't get it, or any thing else! Huffman is exceptional in this role, and deserves the recognition for her efforts. She gains so much sympathy when she breaks on children's medication, Lynette is one most people would love to sit and ""bitch"" with, I know I would. Next is Gabrielle Solis(Eva Longoria), the perfect woman, the rich marriage the most dreaming life of the block...AS IF! She sleeps with teens, and worms her way in and out of situations both good and bad, but she has her funny moments. Longoria is predictably slutty temptress, with minor qualities to redeem, so far. With a little learning for Gabrielle, we might see more than pretty faces with Mrs. Solis, but Longoria is alright. Last, but NEVER least, is Edie Britt(Nicolette Sheridan), a man-hungry woman with a wip and handcuffs! She will walk all over you to get to your man! Watch out for Edie! Sheridan is just right for this caustic, little sexy villainess of the street. Yes, all the women shine in their glory of the show! Better than anything else on TV right now, and probably in the future, ""Desperate Housewives"" will satisfy to the very touch of perfection, and beyond! Marc Cherry has created a masterpiece with this one! Thank the almighty for this one coming to the TV screen! May we be blessed with this show for many, many years to come!!!!! A perfect 10/10, 100% brilliant!",/review/rw7783648/?ref_=tt_urv

","One of the TV reviewers for ""Time Out""'s London edition wondered why ""Desperate Housewives"" has so handily repeated its American success in Britain. Since not every show that's a hit in America exports well to the UK (""Friends"" gathered plenty of them over here, and ""CSI: Insert Subtitle Here"" has consistently been a key player for what used to be called Channel 5; on the other hand, ""Murphy Brown"" landed on stony soil when it was shown on BBC2, and don't get UK fans started on how ""The West Wing"" fares here), that's a good question.

","This is one of those rare shows that has it all . So much so that I even invested in the dvd box set ! Like many of the other reviews state , it hooks you in from the very first episode. I never gave it a chance when it first aired back in 2004 ; I dismissed it as a ridiculous soap opera . However, one episode in and you'll KNOW that this is no ORDINARY soap opera, it's soaps on steroids ! Brilliantly written characters, brilliantly acted actors and an absolutely ICONIC cinematography, and that's the truth , people get into the show and (like myself ) become obsessed with the picturesque neighborhood(then get let down when you google it and find out it's actually a famous set - same one from ""The Burbs"" I believe) . And yes , the women are depicted doing deplorable things and so there's No denying that . But it's just the RIGHT AMOUNT of dirty and campy to still be classified a classic . Give it a watch ... see what all the fuss is about ...",/review/rw7783648/?ref_=tt_urv

27 March 2018,eyferyel,10," CAN BE SEEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN!
","Not only this series will entertain you but it will also teach you everything! It can cheer you up if you are feeling down with Gabrielle Solis (real fans will know what I'm talking about) but it will also not be afraid to tell you about sad things such as death and cancer because that's how real life is. The show itself starts with the suicide of Mary-Alice Young. 
So it may be happening in the beautiful, fancy and rich neighbourhood named Wisteria Lane but that doesn't mean it has to be perfect. Money can't buy everything.
And all along the episodes, through the 8 seasons there is a moral that keeps us really hooked. There is more than 50 deaths in this series (Edie Britt, Rex Van De Camp...) and god knows that this show is not afraid to kill our favourite characters! Honestly, who didn't cry when Mike Delfino died!? Even after 4 break-ups between him and Susan (including a coma and a car accident!). Now we've seen it all! But don't worry, there are also lots of beautiful moments: many weddings and births will make you weep with joy. 
To sum up, I would say that this series is tragic but full of humour at the same time. 
It is art imitating life.",/review/rw7783648/?ref_=tt_urv

","This show is amazing, addicting, and can be watched over and over again. It is a dark comedy but has its serious moments as well. It will make you cry, laugh, and cackle. You do need to get past the first two episodes which can be a little slow but they are very important to the story..:. Once you get past those two episodes you will be obsessed. I started watching it in 2016 because I wasn't allowed to watch it when it originally aired so I had no idea what to expect when I started it but I am so glad I did! I love the character of Bree and we have a lot of similarities, all of the housewives are loveable in their own ways. Perfect show for both men and women it's not a very feminine show at all, the drama will entice everybody.",/review/rw7783648/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2018,vesy90,10," This show has it all
","Such colourful, rich and exciting cast and story-lines. The sweet, romantic and adorably awkward Susan and the tough, practical and courageous Lynette, whom any man would benefit from being married to. Both of them are very down to earth and very endearing. Then we have the glamourous Gabrielle, who might be shallow and arrogant at times, but at her core is very loving and loyal and someone that really can be relied on, both as a friend and a spouse (yes, despite the affair) and Bree Van de Kamp who might be too harsh and uptight in some ways, but, as in Gabrielle's case, whose positives far outweigh her negatives. I was happy to see women in their middle years being the stars of the show. Beauty and youth aren't as important as people believe. Not that those gorgeous ladies aren't lovely, of course. They look spectacular. Especially Teri Hatcher (Susan). The guys were great too. And the mysteries, the funny moments and the romance. We have Mike and Susan that are a classical will they won't they idealized romance and Carlos and Gaby that are more edgy. I loved their banter, their fights and I wasn't worried about them at all. I knew that they loved each other despite everything and I'm so happy that they end up together, after all. And that Bree too finds her soulmate. She deserves it, after everything she goes through with the men in her life. And Tom and Lynette, who never divert ways, despite everything that happens to them. They are rock-solid. And I love Ian and Carl too, despite the latter not being all that reliable. The way he and Susan are in their, unfortunately, not too many moments together, reminds me of Carlos and Gaby. Beautiful, wonderful, exciting. It's romantic, it's realistic, it's sad, it's funny, it's dark and mysterious, it's warm and welcoming. This show has it all.",/review/rw7783648/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2006,HeartMonger,," My Final Thoughts: This show is done for.
","When ""Desperate Housewives"" first premiered in early fall of 2004, it was a major and vast hit: It was the number one show of television for the week, and audiences all over were enthralled and taken with the likable characters and equally likable actors who portrayed them. The show then was able to make more appropriate ends meet; there were magazine articles, and reviews hysteria, with each one of the 'housewife' actresses getting the proper amount of attention and stardom. The ratings soared, and sky rocketed; the producers, and writers were satisfied, the plot lines worked perfectly. Each housewife had a storyline that lasted the entire season, only one really big desperation for each one, but one that was real and enough to soak up the satire and make it last an entire season, while giving audiences something to think about. Each housewife represented you or someone you knew, male or female, and though juiced with satire, the show had a gritty realism that was hard to shake off. When a housewife made a decision, shocking, or expected, it was with requited realism. and enough down to earth material, so that when a big moment occurred, it was Big! And it kept audiences tuning in for more week after week. After twenty - two episodes of almost perfect, entertaining satire, and wit, the season finale aired, and gave Mary Alice Young, the show's unseen narrator, a real purpose (not to mention a damn fine finale monologue) and gave audiences a real cliffhanger, everyone was waiting to see what was next....",/review/rw7783648/?ref_=tt_urv

","This show had a GRIP on me. I've never been one for comedies or shows that went outside the teen drama realm but this one is truly a masterpiece. Every single character has development, goes through an arc and is so complex. The fact that this show is narrated by the girls' friend who died of suicide... genius. The series finale... genius. The theme song... genius. The deaths... genius. And i must sidebar and talk about the unique and amazing use of mental illness throughout this show. The fact that this show gives representation to OCD, alcoholism, drug addiction, BPD, depression, narcissism, and suicide in multiple forms, is seriously comendable. I've never felt so attached to characters and friendships as i felt with this show, literally was balling when i finished it. Also small appreciation for all the ""into the woods"" lyrics that were used as episode titles, it was a small cool thing i was able to notice.",/review/rw7783648/?ref_=tt_urv
