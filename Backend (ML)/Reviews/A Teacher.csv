26 September 2021,leesimon-26357,10," Don't let the trailers dissuade you from viewing
","For the first third of the film, I kept thinking ""I know where this is going because the trailer completely gave it away, so just get there, movie!"" And then the movie goes paces completely not hinted at in the trailer.",/review/rw7566365/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2021,JohnRayPeterson,8," This movie has depth; it's classic drama movie making
","The title is misleading but it's a smart one in the context of the movie, if you pay attention to details; it is clearly in the detail you find proof that it was carefully chosen. You'll see. This pure drama, not a comedy despite what category may be attributed to it, is a game changer. It is not to be confused in any respect with a very same titled 2006 movie.",/review/rw7566365/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2022,jtindahouse,5," Going to lose people early and not reward the ones that stick around adequately
",'Small Engine Repair' is going to lose a lot of audience member's attention in the first 60-70 minutes. That's how long it takes for anything of interest to happen in the film. That shows a lot of trust in its audience to hang in there. The absolute key if you are going to structure your film that way is that the pay-off has to be worth it. Sadly this film can't live up to that requirement.,/review/rw7566365/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2021,piggulu,9," Shame we were the only 2 people in the theater
","I didn't know anything about this movie beforehand, only seeing it in the theater list the day before but the trailer seemed decent and I'm a fan of Bernthal. AMC had it listed as a ""thriller"" instead of ""comedy"" so that also played a big part into deciding to see it.",/review/rw7566365/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2022,Nevergivea10,7," It was worth the wait
",It takes a long time before this movie really begins. Actually the boring beginning makes the last half even better. I wasn't expecting this movie to go where it went. Don't read the spoilers before you watch it and you'll be surprised.,/review/rw7566365/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2021,saysjenn,8," Worth Watching
","This movie has great actors and the chemistry between them strong. The story is heavy dialogue but it keeps the story on point. This one is a slow build that is worth watching. It really surprises me, which rarely happens with movies.",/review/rw7566365/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2021,gab-67599,8," Revenge With A Heart
","I enjoyed this movie even though I do not enjoy slow moving movies this one was ok. Definitely worth the time, but be your own judge and watch it. The acting was on point and it was a bit sad.",/review/rw7566365/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2021,awoland,10," Real Movie Making
","Fantastic performances! Terrific character development. My wife & I could not turn away. As parents of daughters in this crazy day & age, it really does hit home. We felt the full gambit of emotions, as the movie hits true in many ways.",/review/rw7566365/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2021,choiseburgerz,10," Enough to make a father cry
","Outstanding film. Spot on production, captures ""Live Free or Die"" New Hampshire city life well. The acting was outstanding. It's very well written, very funny at times, with a looming sense of potential heartbreak. The bond of lifelong best friends and family gives it the wholesome soul throughout the film, but when the heartbreak eventually comes it turns to anger and vengeance.",/review/rw7566365/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2022,skykyiv,7," Neither light nor darkness
","This film is full of mixed messages, morals, feelings. Really worth a watch for any seasoned movie aficionado.",/review/rw7566365/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2022,jeff-2051,7," Above Average Small Budget Film
","I don't understand the ultra-low or the ultra-high reviews. It's a very good script about family, violence, regret, redemption etc. Could it have been better? Yes. Maybe 20-minutes shorter with better editing, but for crying-out-loud, it's far above virtually everything on network television or comic book movies.",/review/rw7566365/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2021,davidmalaimo,8," went in blind but was pleasantly surprised
","I went into this movie w no clue what it was. Funny enough, the first thing that appears on screen is a definition of Manch Vegas, a city in NH that i know very well. Though there were some cliches in there it still felt realistic. The macho guys messin w each other in pretty psychologically messed up ways seems realistic, as is the sorta New England chivalric duty for family. The abuse masked by humor. I'd say it's a pretty realistic. It was wicked funny at some parts, really dark at others. The plot thatt you don't see coming kind of messed with you and perhaps was sloppily done but by the end it works.",/review/rw7566365/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2021,lylewes,10," Phenomenal movie!
","I was hesitant to watch this after reading a few of the negative reviews, but then I remembered we live in a hypersensitive cancel culture, so a majority of the negative reviews were easily dismissed.",/review/rw7566365/?ref_=tt_urv

17 March 2022,d_penn,6," Pretty decent movie
",Definitely enjoyed this unique movie. A couple twists and turns along the way that I didn't see coming and some dark but good comedy thrown in. The ending is a defined twist. I KNOW you won't guess the ending.,/review/rw7566365/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2021,gregoryallum-30372,8," Pure drama with the fantastic Jon Bernthal

9 February 2022,LincolnSixEko,5," Takes WAY too long
","You'll sit through 60-70 minutes of ""character development"" to get to the real meat of the movie. If you can make it through that long, it's a decent movie. But then...it ends kinda abruptly and somewhat unsatisfying.",/review/rw7566365/?ref_=tt_urv

13 September 2021,mokhlesrahman,9," Watch it in theater!
",This movie should get more exposure. It's easily of the most underrated movies of 2021. It's dialogue heavy and the banters are hilarious between the 3 friends. They have a great chemistry and it keeps u hook until the end. The story is also engaging. Plus Jon bernthal is always a plus!,/review/rw7566365/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2022,SnoopyStyle,6," some good high
","Terrence Swaino (Jon Bernthal), Patrick 'Packie' Hanrahan (Shea Whigham), and Frank Romanowski (John Pollono) are best friends since childhood. The trio comes from the working class in New England. Frank is struggling to raise daughter Crystal (Ciara Bravo) with baby momma Karen (Jordana Spiro) supposedly in recovery.

20 November 2021,denghizek,7," Brilliant performance, solid writing but...
","The ending was the most disappointing ending I have ever saw. The other parts were brilliantly written, I was glued to the scren, It's clear that they put some thought in the dialogues. But the ending felt like they didn't put any thought into it. It was like... Will you be a good boy Chad? Yes. Ok bye..... Heh I lied mofos.",/review/rw7566365/?ref_=tt_urv
