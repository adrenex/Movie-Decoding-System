","Typical Peter Jackson, however gonna watch the even longer extended 3 hours 20 minutes edition in 4k, not watched in years but the picture is epic apart from it being too warm for my liking. The sound is the unusual DTS-X high def sound and already is gorgeous!",/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv

","If the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy cemented Peter Jackson as a director of the highest order and made him the new king of the world, KING KONG seals his position as a Director and eliminates any trace of doubt that he may have been a one hit wonder.",/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2006,BuddyBoy1961,7," A 10-star 2-hour movie screaming to get out of a 7-star 3-hour movie
","Let me be the first to admit that there's nothing wrong with a long movie, nothing at all. ""Titanic"" was a long movie that was as exactly as long as it needed to be. ""Gone with the Wind"" was a really long movie that was exactly as long as it needed to be. ""Dances with Wolves"" was a long movie that I wish had been even longer when I saw it in the theater. But ""King Kong""? Phhewww...this sucker clocks in at least 30-60 minutes longer than it needs to be. While it played, I kept inadvertently thinking to myself, ""Boy, we really should be out to sea by now...they haven't reached the island yet?...man, are they EVER gonna find Ann?...jeez, when are we gonna go back to Manhattan already?..."" and so on. Hand to God--I actually yawned twice during the last third of this movie. I even closed my eyes for a second before I realized, 'hey...you can't just rewind this when you wake up!'",/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv

15 December 2005,BigHardcoreRed,," Truly A Masterpiece!
","Let me just say that with all of the remakes that have been coming out, King Kong may have been the most deserving and the most in need of being remade. I could not think of a better director for this type of film than Peter Jackson.",/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2005,skymovies,10," A roaring success
","Uh-oh, 45 minutes in and no sight of the gorilla. It's 1933, and to make his movie masterpiece, producer Carl (devious) has lured actress Ann (fetching) and screenwriter Jack (heroic) onto a ship bound for exotic climes. The crew - grizzled captain, philosophical first mate, grubby cook, callow cabin boy - reckon that Carl is leading them into trouble. And so he is.",/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2005,pyrocitor,10," A Monumental Success of a Movie
","If it had been announced that a remake of the classic ""King Kong"" was being made without the name Peter Jackson attached to it, there is no doubt audiences would have been outraged. But after the enormous success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it would seem that the general public has learned to trust director Peter Jackson. After watching his remake of King Kong, I would have to say that their trust was well placed.",/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2005,dtb,10," Jackson's Soulful, Spunky, Spectacular Labor of Love
","I was one of the lucky winners of the Kong is King.net World Premiere Ticket contest, so my husband and I had the pleasure of seeing KING KONG in Times Square's Loews E-Walk Theatre. I knew I'd like it the minute I saw the Art Deco opening credits, very reminiscent of RKO's style. The movie only got better from there, carrying us moviegoers on a roller-coaster ride of adventure, romance, and eye-popping special effects. What raises Jackson's take on KING KONG above other rock'em-sock'em action blockbusters is that it's so clearly a labor of love in every sense of the term, a spectacle with soul and spunk. It's not every rollicking adventure film that begins with scenes of life in 1933 New York City, when the Great Depression was at its worst. No wonder plucky but vulnerable actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts is at her most beautiful and winsome as a more proactive version of Fay Wray's star-making role) is willing to take a chance with fast-talking movie producer/director Carl Denham (Jack Black, a rascally delight) on his latest project, involving leaving for the South Seas that very night.",/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2006,bob the moo,," Attempts at depth are worthy enough even if they don't work but the rest still produces a commendable special effects blockbuster
","1933 New York and two people find themselves in difficult circumstances, albeit for different reasons. Carl Denham is a movie producer who wants to make his big picture but finds the studio unwilling to support him. Ann Darrow is an actress who has hit hard times and is one meal away from having to become a performer in a seedier version of ""acting"". While frantically searching for an actress that he can quickly convince to come on a mystery voyage to shoot on a distant island, Carl meets Ann and convinces her to come along on the strength of the involvement of writer Jack Driscoll. After an eventful journey, they arrive at the island but to suggest that they face a ""troublesome"" shoot is a real understatement.",/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv

1 April 2006,thinker1691,10," A Classic Revisited
","To movie goers everywhere, the remake of a classic film has always been one of colossal disappointment. The film King Kong which originated in the 1930's has stood the test of time. In 1976, a remake was offered with Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lang. However, despite Bridges' enormous talent, the film itself fell well short of the mark. In the original it was Robert Armstrong, Fay Wray and Bruce Cabot who challenged the might of King Kong. In this new version, director Peter Jackson combines the talents of Jack Black as Carl Denham, Naomi Watts, as Ann Darrow and Adrian Brody as the hero against the Eight Wonder of the World. Asides from the fantastic new animatronic scenes which adds towering adventure and blood curling excitement, the real 'special' effect to this new version is King Kong himself. Adroitly brought to life by Andy Serkis, the giant ape not only displays unbridled power, explosive terror, but a deep sympathetic quality which elicits long over due admiration for the creature. So much so, one wishes the ending would not finish like the original. All in all, this remake is truly a welcomed contender to the original, earning the director and his cast enormous applause for a film which not only hit it's mark, but does so with fulsome praise from audiences everywhere. Well done! *****",/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv

",A refreshing take on the previously released King Kong movies,/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2005,Keatonics,5," I just could not suspend that much disbelief!
","I agree with most of you that the effects were spectacular, but judging a film on this single criterion makes one a shallow viewer. You must judge the story on its completeness, the characters must be judged for their depth and believability (and yes, I found Kong to be a believable character, but found most of the others to be very shallow, indeed). The cinematography was interesting but typical of modern films, the costumes not correct for the period, same with the hairstyles. The New York exteriors were contrived, and some obviously shot on the Universal back lot.",/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2005,marcosaguado,9," A Giant Of A Movie
","Enormous, bigger than the ape, much bigger. Thrilling and jaw dropping effects come one after the other without allowing time to breath and/or more importantly, to think. The dinosaurs's stampede, the creepy crawlers and King Kong himself you'll have to see for yourself to actually believe it. The humans are a whole other story. Naomi Watts does wonders with what she's got. She is a dream to behold long before the screaming starts. Jamie Bell gives it his all and so does Colin Hanks but Jack Black, I'm afraid, was left to his own devices and those are perfectly suited to ""School Of Rock"" not this, not in a long, long shot. He gets very tiresome very soon and Adrien Brody has nothing to cling to. But now, putting that aside, I bet Jackson's ""King Kong"" is going to make history and rightly so. Three hours of a familiar yet totally new adventure. Long Live The Cinema.",/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2008,Dragoneyed363,9," Had heart, soul and passion; Brilliant
","I rewatched King Kong yesterday and was amazed at how wonderful it was, that I had not remembered it being. It's excellently paced, though some call it too long, and incredibly well played and thought out, with breathtaking performances, lovable characters brought by the amazing, superb cast and crew, and most of all a loving, humane, sensitive King Kong. There's no doubt for me that this captivating adventure is the best telling of King Kong to date.",/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2022,sterlin_rivera,," The Greatest Monster Movie of All-Time
","King Kong is my favorite monster movie of all time and also my favorite remake ever. The 1933 King Kong is amazing, but Peter Jackson managed to an terrific reimagining of the giant ape and offered a ton of great action and effects.",/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2006,vitaleralphlouis,1," JACKSON'S Boring, Awful, Silly Remake of a Classic.
","Peter Jackson's movie isn't good enough to rise to the level of trashing a classic. This clueless filmmaker has no concept of character development, plot continuity, the necessity of camaraderie between characters in an adventure movie, or the need for heroes vs girly men.",/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,atjudkins,10," Still holds up!
","I remember watching this at around 8 years old and not getting past the hour and 20 mark because I got so scared. As an adult, who's since attended film school, I can watch it in it's entirety and be completely blown away. It's a surprisingly emotional movie, and the CGI still holds up 17 years later, which lends itself to incredible set pieces and an emotional connection with Kong. It really is a tragic movie, and on that I think could be released today and no one would bat an eye at the special effects. They're that good.",/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2005,Gary-161,1," The Peter Principle
","Not content with lecturing us on class and colonialism, Peter Jackson wants to make The Passion of the Kong. It wasn't beauty that killed the beast, he wags his finger at us, but you the audience, in the name of entertainment for the price of a ticket. The crucified ape! ",/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2006,ccthemovieman-1,4," One Word: OVERKILL
","I am not one of those classic buffs that automatically dislikes a re-make. Hey, sometimes they are better.....sometimes. This is definitely NOT one of those cases. Of course the special effects far more advanced than something in the 1930s but, other than that, the original is far better than this one, in story and in likable and believable characters and beasts. This could have been have super - a fabulous and memorable re-make - but director Peter Jackson went the way of most filmmakers and media people of today........meaning OVERKILL a story.",/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2006,jack_thursby,1," King Bomb
","Where oh where did it all go wrong? You had a $200 million budget, special effects wizards up the wazoo and Peter ""LOTR"" Jackson directing a bona fide classic that could only benefit from a modern retelling. However, the end result -- a bloated, melodramatic, self-indulgent dog's breakfast of a movie -- proves the maxim that sometimes, ""less is more."" King Kong is a very simple story, in fact, its almost a parable or fable, and the drama and excitement is all in how you tell that story. The original Kong (1933), despite its dated effects, still remains a gripping, moving experience because of the way the story is told through the magic of the cinema. Peter Jackson obviously hasn't watched the original for some time because his version takes all the magic out and replaces it with boring special effects and long running sequences that badly need editing. Why Jackson decided to stretch this simple movie to over 3 hours is a question only he can answer.",/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2006,SonOfMoog,7," Beauty and the Beast
","This is a wonderful homage to a wonderful old movie. It doesn't have a lot of its own to commend it, but it really doesn't need anything. It's obvious to anyone who has seen the original that Peter Jackson loves the movie. And, that love helps to carry this remake in its slow and tedious moments. So, King Kong (2005) works for me, and I think it will work for most who see it, especially those who've seen the original.",/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2005,Doylenf,8," Superb visuals, stunning impact...if a bit overproduced...
","No doubt Peter Jackson's superb CGI effects and handsome production values will make his KING KONG just as much of a hit with the filmgoing public as Merian C. Cooper's B&W RKO original back in 1933. But even with the vast improvement in special effects, a superior script and some extremely well acted leads capable of bringing real terror and thrills to the well-known storyline, one can still retain a certain fondness for the less flamboyant original.",/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2006,krorie,7," The Abominable Snowman on Skull Island
","Is this movie good? Yes and no. It is very good in parts, such as the Skull Island sequence which is so long it is almost a film in itself. Also, it is very bad in parts, such as the long beginning which starts with a bang showing vivid images of the Great Depression, even though most of the songs used are from the Jazz Age of the 1920's, but is dragged out until it becomes one big bore with the viewer kept waiting to see the star of the show, King Kong. And the film is also ho-hum in parts. The death of Kong is strung out so long that it becomes overly gushy and sentimental. Certainly the original 1933 feature handles the ""It was beauty killed the beast"" in a much nobler way.",/review/rw1330003/?ref_=tt_urv
