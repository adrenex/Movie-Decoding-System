22 February 2006,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," Just Like Heaven is a cute romantic comedy with some minor flaws, but you quickly get past them
","For a romantic comedy, I felt that this was one of the better one's. Reese and Mark are so adorable in this movie together and all you do is root for their characters for fall in love with each other because it's such a sweet story. I did have one problem that I felt was a plot hole, if Reese's character didn't remember who she was, how did she remember that she spilled cough syrup on her pillow? When you watch the film you'll understand. But besides that plot hole, I did enjoy watching the awesome chemistry between Reese and Mark. They are two great actors who make fun comedies. I would highly recommend this fun little love story, it takes me back into the unchained melody days. :D Seriously, folks, enjoy! ",/review/rw5706662/?ref_=tt_urv

10 September 2005,aharmas,9," This couple does romantic really well
","It has been a good season for romantic comedies. Earlier on Diane Lane and John Cusack proved that comedies didn't have to be stupid, as it was properly demonstrated in a recent sex comedy. Stick to the conventions, find people with good chemistry and good looks, and you might strike gold. Witherspoon has shown incredible amounts of charm in previous outings, and this time she is on fire. The amazing surprise is Mr. Ruffalo, as her smitten ""friend"". He is a pleasure to watch, matching Witherspoon scene by scene and stealing a few on his own. He has fantastic comedic timing and knows how to charm his audience.",/review/rw5706662/?ref_=tt_urv

24 April 2010,blacklist-1,7," A charming and sweet supernatural rom-com with two likable leads.
","A rom-com with a twist of the supernatural, which makes the story original. This movie plays wonderfully with the audience's expectations at whether Reese Witherspoon's character Elizabeth is real as her and David (played by Mark Ruffalo) try and figure out why he can only see her etc. There are a couple of good twists later on as they piece things together. Though on meeting they resent each other, they soon start to bond and the resentment turns into romance. The transition between dislike and love is handled extremely well at just the right pace making it believable. The script is surprisingly witty making it smart and the acting between Ruffalo and Witherspoon is really good with a lovely chemistry between them. They are so likable particularly Witherspoon at the start, that you care deeply about them and just root for them to be together.",/review/rw5706662/?ref_=tt_urv

","No sooner has David Abbott moved into his sublet apartment in San Francisco when he begins seeing a ghost. He is not scared because he likes what he sees: a beautiful young woman who wants to get his attention in helping her. Since the apartment is a rare find, David decides to stay. Elizabeth, the young woman who comes in and out of his life, seems to be suffering from a case of amnesia because she doesn't seem to remember much of what happened to her.",/review/rw5706662/?ref_=tt_urv

","In a day of love = sex, along comes supernatural love at its finest. Just Like Heaven features Reese Witherspoon as Elizabeth, a well known but lonely doctor comatose from an accident.

Three months later, the landscape architect David Abbott (Mark Ruffalo) is recovering from the loss of his wife, and rents her apartment with furniture in San Francisco.

25 September 2005,jlwalker19-1,9," I was entertained
","Why is a movie starring the wonderful Reese Witherspoon labeled a chick flick? Seems to me any male would want to see it. The viewer cannot help but love her character in this movie. Motherhood and marriage must agree with her, as she has never looked better.",/review/rw5706662/?ref_=tt_urv

24 November 2005,harry_tk_yung,," Good movie; misleading trailer
","The trailer would want to have you believe that this is another ""Ghost"", or ""All of me"" or ""Heavens can wait"". Surprise! It's none of the above. If you really want to make up one of those tediously unimaginative summary lines of ""what meet what"", call it ""Sleeping Beauty meets The Constant Gardener"" and that would be the closest you can get.",/review/rw5706662/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2005,kristin_pettit,9," Worth Seeing
","I rated this movie a nine because I feel that it has really accomplished what movies like this should accomplish. It IS a chic flick, and it is not going to be nominated for any academy awards, but it is has a very solid story with a great cast and great chemistry. Unbelievable as it may be, the story is one that should be told, and was told well.",/review/rw5706662/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2005,paulala343,10," Wonderfully acted comedy; sensitive, silly and sweet
","Just saw a preview of this film last night, and I have to say, I can't wait to see it again. Usually, I'm not a huge fan of ""otherwordly"" type films, but this one is original and fun. Mark Ruffalo and Reese Witherspoon have great chemistry, and the script is smart. He's a depressed landscape architect trying to get his life back together; she's a disgruntled spirit, wondering what ever happened to hers. After their initial frustrations (she hates how he doesn't use coasters or pick up trash in HER apartment, he hates how she appears without notice in what he now considers HIS apartment) they try to piece together the course of events that have left her in this state of limbo. What I loved about this film is David and Elizabeth's progression from animosity to genuine affection, as they alternately pester then rely on one another. He becomes dedicated to trying to help her, despite appearing insane to everyone in San Francisco, except for a wonderfully quirky psychic bookstore clerk played by Jon Heder (aka Napoleon Dynamite.) Not since Patrick Swayze quarreled with a Whoopi Goldberg in ""Ghost"" have I been so amused by a spirit haunting a mere mortal. This is a great chick flick, but would work out nice for a date, too. Just have a tissue handy!",/review/rw5706662/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2006,jenniferhb106,5," Best romantic comedy in a long time
","Its been a long while since i've enjoyed a romantic comedy so much - possibly the last romantic comedy I enjoyed as much was Two Weeks Notice in 2002. The cast is fantastic - Mark Ruffalo and Reese Witherspoon make for great on screen chemistry and the script is sharp yet it is not all out and out comedy, it has subtle moments and enough tender moments to make it gel and become believable. Even the men in the group enjoyed the film, they were laughing and sighing along with us girls, which is quite impressive as usually they regard romantic films as girly trash to be avoided like the plague. While we didn't set out to see this film, we actually wanted to watch King Kong but tickets had sold out, it is well worth watching and I can't wait to see it again on DVD!",/review/rw5706662/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2005,lovadoll,10," Really really good, and i hate chick flicks.
","I admit i am a girl who hates chick flicks, and had to be dragged to this film, and i'm happy to say this was freakin hilarious. just like heaven follows a male widow who moves in to an apartment inhabited by a ghost who can't remember her past. They find themselves in hilarious situations trying to help each other.Reese Witherspoon was fantastic and so was mark ruffalo. SO if your in for a good laugh,or a sweet,charming chick flick then Just Like Heaven is the movie for you!!!! If I enjoyed this anyone can.It's kind of a mix between ghost and a romance.Women will love it!!!Men will love it!!!Kids will love it!!! It's funny for everyone who's in the mood for a heartwarming comedy.",/review/rw5706662/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2020,bbewnylorac,7," It's not too bad
","People who hate rom coms will loathe this one. It not only has a starry eyed young couple dancing round each other until - well, you know what happens in the end - but it has that extra supernatural element. Yes, our heroine Elizabeth (Reese Witherspoon) is in a coma after knocking her head on the way to a date with our hero David (Mark Ruffalo). The twist is that her spirit, in the form of an imaginary friend that only he can see, appears to Ruffalo, when he rents her former apartment. He comes to understand that her physical self, unconscious in the hospital, isn't brain dead, and he tries to stop her family turning her life support machine off, but he can't explain to them why. Ruffalo and Witherspoon are both appealing, intelligent actors and it's hard to say whether they're treating it all as a laugh. Ruffalo just plays his usual adorable self. The young, perky Witherspoon has about three expressions - doe eyed, frowning and happy. But they do have good chemistry as a couple, and the final scenes in the hospital are funny. The very underrated comedian Jon Heder (Napoleon Dynamite, Blades of Glory) puts in a hilarious cameo as a stoned, unhinged clairvoyant in a shop who the couple consult.",/review/rw5706662/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2005,albell1006,8," better than I thought
","When I went to see this movie, I went in with high hopes and I was not disappointed. I enjoy Reese as an actor, and am becoming a fan of Mark Ruffalo's. Reese, as always, was the perfect main character that you just fell in love with from the very beginning and I really like Mark's ability to be a very physical actor, which Just Like Heaven took wonderful advantage of. The movie's storyline is good, it does have a couple of somewhat predictable turns, but what movie doesn't? The acting is very well done, I haven't laughed that much in a very long time and Reese and Mark have great chemistry on-screen. If you are looking for a really good chick flick to make you laugh, cry, and feel every motion in between, this is a great movie for you.",/review/rw5706662/?ref_=tt_urv

22 September 2005,ammer18,10," Just Like Heaven
","Mark Ruffalo and Reese Witherspoon are both excellent, but sometimes when two astounding actors act opposite one another, a movie flops-- this is not such a movie. Just Like Heaven is the best movie I have seen all year. These two actors put all they've got into their performances, and it shows. The movie is sweet, it has a fairy-tale feel, which is comforting in an uncertain world. The chemistry between Reese and Mark is amazing and the story is unusual and entertaining. The plot is fairly predictable, but the audience is thrown a few curve balls. There is uncanny humor, yet the movie maintains a poignant sense of reality. I give Just Like Heaven 10 out 10 stars.",/review/rw5706662/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2006,MLDinTN,7," not original but good
","This is another romantic comedy in which one of the leads is a ghost. It's been done several times before, but this version was still entertaining. The 2 lead actors, Reese and Mark, worked good together. Reese plays, Elizabeth, a work-a-holic doctor who is involved in a car accident. Next we meet, David, who is looking for an apartment and rents Lizzy's. Next thing he knows, he sees Lizzy telling him it's her apartment and to get out. Only problem, she's walking through objects and is a ghost. Only David can see her. He helps her discover who she was and what happened. They discover she's at the hospital in a coma and not dead. It's up to the 2 to figure out how to get her spirit back into her body before the plug is pulled.",/review/rw5706662/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2007,ray-280,8," Another B+ for the writer
","If by chance you follow writers and producers as close as actors, you'll figure out what you need to know about ""Just Like Heaven"" before you tune in. Writer Peter Tolan, formerly of Murphy Brown, and currently of Rescue Me, spits out yet another good film as if he has them stored in a bottomless pit. If he weren't so good at what he does, one might get bored with the formula, but because he is good, what would be repetitive tripe in the hands of a less competent writer manages to become a series of pleasant signatures.",/review/rw5706662/?ref_=tt_urv

Lovely supernatural rom-com, almost undone by its over-egged and slightly rushed finale, but held together beautifully by the considerable charms of Witherspoon and Ruffalo.",/review/rw5706662/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2020,brookenichole-98054,8," Adorable
","Just Like Heaven is so cute. It's the perfect romantic comedy where you just fall in love with the story and characters. Every character has a great significance and the story flows naturally. The scenery in the film is gorgeous.
Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo give amazing performances as they slowly develop feelings for each other. The fact that he can only see and touch her is fantastic. She helps him out of his funk and he helps her learn to live.
Overall, this is one of the best romantic comedies I have ever seen.",/review/rw5706662/?ref_=tt_urv
