26 December 2019,Aktham_Tashtush,8," As peculiar as it might sound, this movie is totally not about religion and that is why it's gotten the reaction it has.
",From the title alone you'd think this is about religion or some kinda propaganda to re-polish the Vatican but it is just not ... It is a two hours of someones life and how change even on the most strict situations can bring progress.,/review/rw5336153/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2019,steven-leibson,10," Amazing writing, amazing performances, incredible movie
","I'm not a Catholic, and this movie is very, very Catholic. But beyond that, it's one of the deepest cinematic examinations of faith I've ever seen. Sir Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce, playing Pope Benedict XVI and Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio (who later becomes Pope Francis) respectively, both deliver brilliant, finely crafted lines with stellar performances. (It's somewhat ironic that two Welsh actors are playing a German and an Argentenian, but most of the film is spoken in English, so it works out in some strange way.) I really didn't follow the most recent transition between Popes, so I had not expected to be so deeply involved with this movie, but I am very glad to have watched it. Highly recommended for its insightful look into the human condition and the underpinnings of faith with its sometimes wavering texture, even for the most religious of us. Beautifully filmed on location in Argentina and the Vatican. If you subscribe to Netflix, then I suggest you watch this movie tonight.",/review/rw5336153/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2019,nomodusproject,9," I don't understand .....
","..... how a dialogue-based movie could make me sooo immersed in it, i cried three times during the movie. I am not a Christian but OMG their acting and the camera ..... they're soooooo good you must watch it coz I have no words to describe it!",/review/rw5336153/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2020,bob-the-movie-man,8," Fantastic performances from two old acting pros.
","Being inaugurated as a new pope in the last century must have been a source of enormous pride. But there must also have been a nagging thought... at some point you are going to be paraded, stiff as a board, around your work courtyard before being taken back inside to your place of work and buried there!",/review/rw5336153/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2019,boblipton,9," The Man In The White Suit
","If you read ghost-written books, you will discover that story is often offered ""as told to"" the real writer. With this movie, we are offered the biography of Pope Francis as told to Benedict XVI, the first pope to resign in more than half a millennium.",/review/rw5336153/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2019,kermitdgorf123,10," Great acting
","Two great actors at the top of their game playing two famous men of the church. Not sure how much is made up and how much of the dialogue between the two holy men is true..but very entertaining and we'll acted by both. Glad to see Jonathan Pryce finally getting the praise he deserves.
Always a fan of the great Sir Anothny Hopkins...he plays Pope Benedict with wicked Humour.
Jonathan Pryce plays the current Pope Francis with humility and a man of his convictions.
Bravo to Netflix for making this film.",/review/rw5336153/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2019,lee_eisenberg,8," Hannibal Lecter meets the High Sparrow
","Watching ""The Two Popes"", I thought about how John Paul II was the first pope to condemn the Catholic Church's anti-Jewish policies, Benedict XVI was more reactionary, while Francis has been trying to make it more progressive. I wondered what the RCC's future holds.",/review/rw5336153/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2019,keithfranklinfowler,10," Four artists at the peak of their power.
","Much has been made of the brilliance of the two title performers, and deservedly so. Both Hopkins and Pryce are absolutely convincing as German and Argentinean pontiffs who converse in English (conveniently for viewers) as their common language. Each actor is so fresh and alive within the personality of his ""character"" that I was easily persuaded they may be truer to the souls of these men than the living originals.
Not enough credit has been paid to Anthony McCarten, the writer of this complex, layered conversation. It is the kind of dialogue great men wish they had spoken. What courage and skill it takes to undertake such a verbal tour de force.
(Imagine if world leaders couldn't hire speech writers. Could Shakespeare's kings and queens really speak as well as he wrote for them?)
McCarten has written the scripts for three Oscar-winning actors; isn't it time he was recognized?
And Fernando Meirelles is the masterful director who brought all the elements together. This is a renaissance man, adept in many fields, from architecture to cinema--and organic farming as well. He has been nominated for one directing Oscar (for ""City of God""), and here he shows his ability to maintain both visual interest and intellectual fascination through two hours of what amounts to an intense, extended talk.
That the movie never felt ""talky"" is a tribute to all four great artists.",/review/rw5336153/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2019,gregorycookjohnson,8," Pleasantly surprised
","I just watched this at TIFF, and thought it was a very charming film. The performances by Pryce and Hopkins were exceptional - very humorous, and the subtleties of there characters made for a fascinating chemistry. Highly recommended!",/review/rw5336153/?ref_=tt_urv

","Oscar worthy performances, stunning landscapes, sets and cinematography, decent directing except for ""The Office"" type annoying fast zoom-ins and shaky cams.

19 January 2020,cardsrock,8," Far more captivating than you'd expect
","For a film about two old guys talking about religion for two hours, this had no right to be as absorbing as it was. Hopkins and Pryce are both simply superb, which is great because the film essentially rests on their shoulders. Whether you're religious or not, you can enjoy this film and appreciate how two people with fundamentally different views can engage in meaningful conversation and eventually become friends.",/review/rw5336153/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2019,Ladybbird-269-945146,10," Outstanding..>NOT a False Review
","Anthony Hopkins & Jonathan Pryce, 2 of the best British actors, in one movie together is rare...
Even more outstanding is the Director was Fernando Meirelles. A MUST see... BUT not based, nor entirely factual on true events. Its just an incredible movie, so enjoy it for what it is....

","Greetings again from the darkness. Abba versus Classical. Perhaps nothing more clearly separates the two men than their musical tastes. Of course, it's their widely disparate views of society and the role of Catholicism that matter most. Expert filmmaker Fernando Meirelles (CITY OF GOD, 2002) and screenwriter Anthony McCarten (BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY, THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING) have crafted a beautiful telling of the story of how these two men crossed paths, and they selected two preeminent actors to play the two Eminences.",/review/rw5336153/?ref_=tt_urv

","There is so much garbage out there that when you come across a movie of such high caliber, centered around two giants of acting, it reinforces your belief in the art. Cinematography, script, direction, music, sets - all are excellent. Highly recommended. Kudos to Netflix. Keep them coming.",/review/rw5336153/?ref_=tt_urv

","..this was a pleasure to watch. Two exceptional performances which were genuinely deeply moving, framed expertly within the context of the fairly recent selection of the Pope(s). Funny at times and also eye opening as an eduction in traditions and dogma V modernisation and reform of the Catholic Church. Whether you have faith or none at all, this is a truly heart warming, non-sentimental journey in the company of two of Britain's finest actors.",/review/rw5336153/?ref_=tt_urv

","I like that Netflix gets the rights to some quality films. Loved being able to watch The Irishman and Marriage Story (both critically acclaimed films) quick and at my own pace without having to go the cinema. The director of City of God, which was marvelous in its own right, returns with a film based on the interactions between a resigning pope and his successor. This is a humorous and well written film mainly strong because of the two charismatic leads.",/review/rw5336153/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2019,phd_travel,9," So fascinating and beautifully produced
",Jonathan Pryce looks a lot like Pope Francis. Anthony Hopkins acts frail and old but doesn't speak clearly sometimes. The filming and sets are very beautiful with a recreated Sistine Chapel - very brightly illuminated and fascinating to look at. The Pope's summer residence is also beautiful. The discussions and differing points of view are interesting as we peek behind the scenes. So is the look at the background of Pope Francis and his life in troubled Argentina.,/review/rw5336153/?ref_=tt_urv
