7 August 2009,aj_ajc_aj,10," The funniest and only Disney channel show i watch!
","This is literally the only Disney channel show i watch. It is much more hilarious than all these other cheesy shows. including its spin-off Cory in the house. You can never get to many ""oh snap's!"" or ""ya nasty's"" its just so funny and always has you laughing. That's So Raven is not just a show for kids or teens or kids and teens it is a Show that the whole family can watch and laugh there guts off. Not only does That's So Raven keep you laughing but it also teaches our children life morals that we all need to know. Disney needs to spend more time playing reruns or even bringing the show back instead playing all of this Hannah Montana and Jonas brothers crap. Great show Raven! As for Disney change is definitely not always good!",/review/rw1645477/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2003,Smoothpants,," Surprisingly hilarious
","I figured for a Disney Channel production, this show would be just amusing, like ""Lizzie McGuire"" (a show I like, but I get no real hearty laughs out of it). ""That's So Raven"" always seems to make me chuckle. But what I am most impressed with is Raven-Symone's knack for physical comedy, and willingness to make herself look ridiculous (but not in a demeaning way) to get the laugh. Almost like Lucille Ball in a sense.",/review/rw1645477/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2003,CmHowell99,," Funny, Funny, and more Funny
","I watch this show when it airs it is really funny. It's about a kid named Raven Baxter voiced by Raven Symone and her best friend Chelsea and her friend Eddie. I couldn't stop laughing at the episode where Raven's party got changed to a different day thanks to a school bully named Nikki and Raven got even by having her friends change her hair with a leaf blower, get her wet with the sprinklers, and give her a towel that had icing on it and Eddie got the camcorder so he can record her and show it to her guests then Raven realizes that two wrongs don't make a right. But the next day Nikki comes over and gets her flowers and she didn't know they had poison ivy. Another time there was an episode where Raven made some new friends and left Eddie and Chelsea out. Then there was an episode where they had to choose a school president Raven wanted to be that person. Another time Eddie was so psyched about making the basketball team that Raven feared she may be losing a friend. Another time Raven caused a class disruption that her teacher wanted to meet her parents and she pretended to be her mother.",/review/rw1645477/?ref_=tt_urv

3 March 2003,shadow_empress,," Clever and witty.
","I've only just watched ""That's so Raven"", but I can tell that it will be on the air for a few years to come.  The script is witty, and Raven has definite screen presence.  It's suitable for younger children, as the dialogue should be fairly comprehendable for any age, and most of the jokes can be enjoyed by nearly any age.  Good job, writers of ""That's so Raven""!",/review/rw1645477/?ref_=tt_urv

","Say what you will but the plot of this show was the best & how she would dress up just to stop it, all the funny characters on the show lol i loved it such imagination",/review/rw1645477/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2020,nicetryjan,10," Best Disney Channel show ever.

21 February 2007,sashank_kini-1,8," A delightful, hilarious show but only for the first few episodes
","well, what can i say about this show. when i started to watch it for the first time with no other programs in my country except for some horrible, puking serials, i loved the show. Raven is a genius in what all she does, from being extremely funny till being serious. She realizes that this isn't a show in which ordinary acting would be beneficial. She can foresee the future but only in the form of bits of visions. And to fulfill the vision or to prevent what she sees in the vision, she puts herself into trouble along with her two best friends, Eddie and Chelsea. the comic timing of this show is absolutely fabulous, the acting is fantastic and the plot, well.... is good. The jokes are out of the world and are told with perfection by Raven, Orlando Brown, Annaliese Van De Pol, Cory ( i forgot his actual name) and Ravens parents ( here too i am forgetful). the first season is good with sensible plots like the one in which Raven has problems with her cousin and others, the second season is marvelous ( i loved the episode in which Raven and Cory make up their own stories about Raven breaking the portrait by mistake. Raven shone like a rising star in that episode), the third season was good except for some of the episodes which hinted the deteriorating quality of the older episodes and as the title suggests, the fourth season is awful.Raven looks a bit like a horrible animal struck by a disease known as obesity, Cory is shown to money minded while the new stars Donna and her assistant Tiffany are truly horrible. the plots are terrible and the episode in which raven comes face to face with Zack and Cory truly shows that mixing to shows is a terrible idea. but then too i give it an eight because of the starting episodes and this was the first show i truly loved. thanks for reading my first comment",/review/rw1645477/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2005,pumpkinmedia,," My prediction, its a good show.
","Thats So Raven. Kids will love to watch this show, but its entertaining for adults too. 'Raven Baxter' (Raven Symone) is a bubbly teenager who loves to make her own clothes, have fun with her friends Chelsea (Anneliese van der Pol) and Eddie (Orlando Brown). Raven also has the power of 'Phsycic Visions'.... Although most people would find these easy to handle, Raven will always find some way to get into a 'bad or embarrassing situation' when she misinterprets the meaning of her visions. This show is very funny. It has an interesting storyline and great actors to play the characters. Its an easy show to watch and I would anytime!",/review/rw1645477/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2019,HollisWoods,10," That's so AMAZING
","I watched this show as a child and fell in love. Raven was a role model of mine growing up & I see why. I wanted binge watch to see if the show still held up 15 years later and it does. I've seen episodes dealing with issues such as body shaming, racism, bullying, & even a little side story about abstinence. Rather than trying to retain a child audience, That's So Raven managed to maintain a Family level of entertainment & humor. It made me laugh a lot & even managed to inspire me a few times.",/review/rw1645477/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2020,Boyofthemoon,8," SEASONS RATED // This show is dank af
","S1 - (7/10) boring. Some Situations are funny but it's too soon.
S2 - (8/10) Surprisingly grows more, and has some of the most DANK dialogue I've seen! That's a good thing, as it brings random humor.
S3 - (8.1/10) Nooice ðŸ‘Œ So many episodes and adventures to choose from.
S4 - (7.6/10) Idk why but this season was a little boring, nice story arc yet weak one-off episodes. Raven is not as funny as she use to be, but don't get me wrong, it's still VERY watchable and like able.
Over all it's a good show. Just ignore plot holes and mistakes, I mean it is a old Disney show. Yet it's very iconic with funny situations and episodes with 2 storylines happening at the same time , quotable quotes, FUNNY lovable characters. Very family - friendly show to watch with friends and the fam (8.1/10)",/review/rw1645477/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2003,unitedbro,," Raven is a budding Superstar!
","This show should be on Network TV like Sister to Sister was. It is at least as good as Half and Half and the Parkers. I don't understand why Disney does not air That's So Raven on Saturday mornings on ABC like it does with Kim Possible. Raven is about to blow up like Nick Cannon did, she has the ability to go over the top with her comedy like Lucille Ball instead of being a diva and not wanting to get dirty or look silly! This show is a riot and now with Hillary Duff leaving Disney it will be a Raven world because we know how Disney gets behind their actors!!!!!!!!!!",/review/rw1645477/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2007,wchngliu,8," For A So-Called Kids Show, That's So Raven Is Great Fun For Adults As Well
","That's So Raven could be lauded as the best kids TV show coming from Disney for some time. Starring one-time Cosby Show and Hangin' With Mr Cooper actress, Raven Simone, she plays a character named Raven Baxter: a typical teenager who has the ability to see into the future and finds herself in a whole manner of wild, wacky and crazy situations, which often involve her family members, mother Tanya, father Victor and her younger brother, Cory and her two best friends, Chelsea and Eddie. By the end of each episode, Raven and the other characters all learn a few things about life and themselves. Dutch-born Anneliese Van Der Pol puts in a good performance as Chelsea, whilst fans of the 90s Olsen twins sitcom, Two Of A Kind may recognise Orlando Brown.",/review/rw1645477/?ref_=tt_urv

3 July 2011,TheLittleSongbird,7," Not bad for a Disney show
","I used to love the Disney Show, but now because of stuff like the High School Musical Series and Hannah Montana airing I can barely stomach it. That's So Raven for me while not perfect was one of their better situation comedies. In later years the writing did become less clever and funny, the story lines got really predictable and throughout the show Eddie had moments when he was annoying. However, the production values were pretty good and I enjoyed the fashions, while the music and theme tune were fun as well. For quite some time the show was helped by some witty and clever writing, nicely constructed stories that benefited from a great concept and good characters, Raven, Corey and Victor being my favourites. The acting is surprisingly decent for a Disney show as well, Raven-Symone has a lot of infectious charm about her. Overall, not bad. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw1645477/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2007,desperado5598,10," Please read this if you posted a bulletin about this show
","I'm sorry I can't afford to do the chat thing, but I read them anyways and it bugs me, so I want to clarify that Raven isn't fat. I just read something that someone put saying that Raven is 5 foot 3 inches and 170 pounds. I don't think she weighs that much, and she's not obese! In case nobody else has noticed, and I promise I don't normally notice things like this since I'm a straight girl... Raven is VERY curvy! She has big hips as well as other body parts that I shouldn't put on a page for a children's show! Don't y'all think that THAT could be what weighs her down?! Duh! And stop being so shallow anyways! Why don't you go talk about Queen Latifah in some stupid chatroom! Raven is awesome and talented, and she sets a very good example for others. That's so Raven is, like, a really good show, and that's what this is meant to discuss, not Raven's weight!",/review/rw1645477/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2006,mirandalambertfan30,7," raven
","i think that raven is a good role model for young girls. shes not the skinny petite cheerleader type(but shes not fat) and not all young girls are either. this factor tells teens that they don't have to be bone skinny to be successful in acting and they can make their dream come true because raven. i think Hollywood needs to get over the fact that not all people can be jessica simpson and take them cause they actually have talent and are fit for the role in the movie. raven has as much talent has any actor thats big, shes has better vocals than hilary duff and Lindsay lohan and has just as much acting skills, she understands that she don't need to damage her body and go anorexia like lohan but can stay a healthy talented young woman and still be a role model for girls.",/review/rw1645477/?ref_=tt_urv

6 April 2021,jazzydonald-90958,10," This Is The Kind Of Diversity We Need Now More Than Ever
","One thing I hated about a lot of kid's shows was how fatphobic they are towards pre-teen and teenage girls. The YouTuber Pop Culture Detective discussed a trope in one of his videos called ""the abhorrent admirer."" In almost every kid's show, especially when a boy is the protagonist, there will be a character who has a crush on one of the main characters and always gets rejected. That character is usually a girl who is overweight, loud, wears frumpy clothes, and is generally stigmatized by the whole school for being unpopular. As a result, them wanting to be loved is seen as a joke. As a black girl who was chubby throughout middle and high school, Raven Baxter holds a special place in my heart. Not only was she a black female main character, but also one who was desired by cute boys, had a great sense of fashion, and generally beloved by lots of people despite being overweight. She was also three-dimensional and was allowed to be flawed and learn lessons while still being a generally kind and caring person. I'm not saying Raven is better than other female teenage characters who are skinny and conventionally attractive. I just wish more overweight (or even average-sized) actresses of color could get more chances to be in the spotlight without being a punchline. We also need to show kids that you don't need to look like a model to be worthy of love and respect.",/review/rw1645477/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2021,bwbw86,8," In my 30s and this show still makes me laugh
","Rewatching this show on Disney+ as an adult has brought me a surprising amount of laughs, and I find myself more engaged in the show and characters than I normally would any other Disney Channel Original. Raven is absolutely hilarious and her physical comedy is truly out of this world. Really, all the characters have their moments. Growing up I remember thinking Chelsea was really funny as the airhead BFF. All in all, there is really something special about this show. The writers put a lot of heart into each episode, and it shouldn't be written off as just a silly kids show.",/review/rw1645477/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2003,AnimagusGirl,," funny and enjoyable
","This show can have interesting plots, and frequently does, and you have it credit for being original. But it's sort of like, if you've seen one Raven episode, you've seen them all. The jokes are sometimes the same, and get boring. But mostly it is funny. And if they try to make the jokes different, it isn't very good. But overall, it's pretty good.",/review/rw1645477/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2020,nakomiah,7," It was funny for it's time.
",I enjoyed the first season more than any other seasons. I don't know why people are so critical of the show. I mean it's pretty simple; a teen with psychic abilities that she often misinterprets. Each character on the show are quirky in their own way and the show never fails when it comes to making me laugh. love it or hate it. I'm watching the reruns on Disney+,/review/rw1645477/?ref_=tt_urv

28 April 2007,sbishop1,9," Last great show ever on Disney Channel
","In late 2002, the Disney Channel ended its winning streak with another great show. After that, every show ever on the channel has either been painful to watch or just so-so. The last show Disney had a winning streak with was...That's So Raven. The humor is satirical, witty, and hardly, if ever, relies on gross-out stupidity. I'm very glad this show was the longest running ever on the channel, but unfortunately its series finale just aired a few weeks ago. Do you know what that means. There is not a single great show on Disney Channel.",/review/rw1645477/?ref_=tt_urv
