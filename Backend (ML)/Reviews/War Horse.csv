10 December 2006,A_Roode,9," A great character film with two excellent performances.
","Since there is very little in the negative column, let me disperse with it first: 'Blood Diamond' might fairly be accused of 'bleeding heart syndrome' (more on that in a bit), has a few minor pacing issues and seems unsure with how to end. The ending that they chose extends the film too far, seems forced and is tacked on. The more natural ending is on the mountainside -- you'll know what I mean when you see it. Those things said, the positives are much greater and this film showcased two towering performances. Djimon Hounsou is nothing short of incredible and I'd be astonished if he isn't considered at Oscar time. Secondly, although I've had little patience for him before, Leonardo DiCaprio has really impressed me this year. With his performances in 'The Departed' and now 'Blood Diamond,' I think I need to reappraise my own biases against him. I'm becoming a fan.",/review/rw1590812/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2006,john_cberry,10," A Hollywood movies tells an African story full of death and violence and presents it with impressive truth.
","Because I lived in Sierra Leone, in fact in Kono, the diamond-mining area of the country, for three years, I had to see Blood Diamond as soon as it came out. It is an excellent movie. Although it was not filmed in Sierra Leone, it captures the reality of the country to a remarkable degree. There is a great deal of violence in this movie, but that violence is organic, realistic, fitting to what happened there. They even manage to convey the fact that the people are as astonished by this violence as we are; Sierra Leone used to be one of the safest countries in the world. The movie tells the facts about conflict diamonds quickly and accurately. DiCaprio's performance is impressive, certainly the best by him I've ever seen: he is totally believable as a white African. Jennifer Connelly's role is much smaller but she makes the most of it. Djiman Housou has enormous physical presence as the brave Mende fisherman. This movie just gets so many things right that the few places it departs from reality are entirely forgivable. I would heartily recommend this movie to everyone; it is the best Hollywood movie I've seen in years.",/review/rw1590812/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2007,Nazi_Fighter_David,8," An action, political adventure at its best!
","""Blood Diamond"" is the kind of action film that makes you think that 'a moment of love, even in a bad man, can give meaning to a life...' ",/review/rw1590812/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2011,classicsoncall,9," ""I am Born Trouble.""
","I almost never catch these big time films when they make their initial debut, but keep their critical acclaim in the back of my mind when I'm trying to decide on what to watch next. ""Blood Diamond"" grabbed a lot of attention when it came out for it's stars DiCaprio and Hounsou, and I have to say, their team up was one of the more eclectic casting decisions I've come across. It reminded me a little of Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier in ""The Defiant Ones"", and if you think about it, that kind of described the main characters here as they pursue a large rare diamond amid rebel strife in the African country of Sierra Leone. My biggest takeaway from the film was just how brutal and uncivilized life can be in parts of the world we're unfamiliar with while we sit in our comfy living rooms watching stories like this unfold. As far as the action component of this picture goes, it's almost too intense with scene after scene engaging in hostile gunfights and brutal combat. The harrowing family ordeal of Hounsou's character is undeniably overwhelming, and given the odds it's miraculous that he makes it out of Africa alive, especially having found his son already brainwashed by his captors. This won't be a contender for a round the fireplace family movie night, but if you're in the mood for unrelenting action and suspense, you'll get your fill here.",/review/rw1590812/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2009,bkoganbing,10," T.I.A.---------- This Is Africa
","One of the best films of the new century so far, Blood Diamond is both great action entertainment and a searing indictment of the exploitation of the African continent even years after the imperial European powers left their colonial possessions to fend for themselves. Africa, a continent wealthy in mineral resources with its peoples reduced to poverty at the mercy of tribal rivalries now armed with the automatic weapons of the former imperialists.",/review/rw1590812/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2006,Margie24,8," Another Oscar worthy turn from DiCaprio
","Leonardo DiCaprio has become one of the premiere American actors. With a set of natural instincts that lends a non-showy, believable quality to all of his performances, versatility, and movie star size charisma that fills up the screen and emotionally hooks the viewer into his character and story, it is hard to think of another male American actor (with the exception of Johnny Depp) who is consistently giving an audience its money worth; these two gentleman have taken the reins from Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, as those two Oscar-winning future legends of the silver screen gracefully age into more mature roles.",/review/rw1590812/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2007,lastliberal,9," God left this place a long time ago.
","I have not been a Leonardo DiCaprio fan. I do like Djimon Hounsou and have seen several of his films. Watching this film, I have to say that both deserve every single award they received and should have probably gotten every award they were nominated for. I only hesitate to state this unequivocally because I have not seen The Last King of Scotland yet.",/review/rw1590812/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2007,ccrivelli2005,8," Diamonds, Nerve And Indifference
","The torturous road of South African diamonds to the greedy fingers of an indifferent world makes this new Edward Zwick movie one of the most powerful Action/Adventure/Dramas to come out of Hollywood in a long time. The perfect balance between entertainment and a thoughtful social commentary helps the center of the story to have a real heart and a palpable respect for us, the audience. All this praise and I still have not mentioned Leonardo Di Caprio or Djimon Hounsou but I'm going to. Di Caprio opens a new door, introducing us to a character who is a first in his already extraordinary career. He startled us as a very young man with ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" before he fell with a serious case of Titanictis. Now, after a three a long and serious Scorsese cures, this spectacular actor makes me believe that we haven't seen anything yet. Remarkable. As remarkable as the soulful Djimon Hounsou who manages to give the film a visible soul. I was moved and yes, I must admit, surprised. Apart from the visual and interpretative prowess of ""Blood Diamond"" there is a realistic view of a third world country as shattering as the unforgettable one in ""City Of God"" Don't miss it.",/review/rw1590812/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2006,RestlessRust,8," Blood Brothers
",What does it take to turn someone into a killer? The answer is different for each character involved in this movie. For some it is survival. For others it is the hope of escape from a life of hell. For some it is family. For others it is greed. Caught in the middle of it all are the children who have such little desire to kill for any reason that they must be brainwashed into becoming the instruments of their masters who claim to offer freedom.,/review/rw1590812/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2007,gavin6942,8," Ripped From the Headlines, the Nearly True Story of Diamonds
","In Sierra Leone, there exists diamonds worth a fair amount of money. But they are harvested by slaves and sold to fund genocide. This is the story of one of those slaves, a diamond smuggler (with connections to Belgium, England, And Liberia) and a journalist. Together, they will fight to win a story, a diamond and a family. But sacrifices will be made.",/review/rw1590812/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2014,CalRhys,," An Undeniably Powerful And Breathtaking Film
","An undeniably powerful and breathtaking film from talented director Edward Zwick. 'Blood Diamond' is a beautifully shot war thriller set against the backdrop of the Sierra Leone civil war, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou in their Oscar-nominated roles. By far one of the best war dramas of modern times, 'Blood Diamond' is a powerful testament in the film industry boasting intense and well-executed action scenes and heart-wrenching drama. Zwick's vision truly outpaces his narrative in this compulsive and thought-provoking tale. An exciting and compelling tale, that stand as a great acting showcase for the two leads.",/review/rw1590812/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2007,bob the moo,," Strong film despite the problems with merging a real horror with a traditional Hollywood narrative
","Separated from his family by rebels, fisherman Solomon is forced to work in the bloody diamond mines, locating diamonds that the rebels use to fund their war against the government. Danny Archer is a former mercenary who now smuggles diamonds out of the conflict zone into neighbouring Liberia so that they can be documented as legal. Maddy Bowen is a journalist, in the area to make a difference by exposing such illegal activity and the suffering it produces.

9 December 2006,forindcine,8," Another fine piece by director Edward Zwick
","A few years back I had the pleasure of visiting Antwerp, Belgium, a place many deem ""the diamond capital of the world."" Never before or since have I been in a location where I was surrounded by so much ""bling"". Storefronts had so many diamonds on display you would think they should be better kept in some European version of Fort Knox.",/review/rw1590812/?ref_=tt_urv

20 March 2007,kosta-pap,7," Great effort, great message, too much Hollywood
","Blood Diamond is an excellent example of how Hollywood formulas can suck the essence out of a unique work of art. The film is exceptionally well done, with great performances, well-written characters, good research and, above all, shocking messages. To all those reviewers who thought it wasn't ""interesting"": Are you kidding me? Three of the most horrible tragedies of our times are shown in the film: - Africa's child-warriors - Militia-led smuggling supporting brutal civil wars and exploiting ancient hatred - The diamond monopoly and its ruthlessness. And the film shows how these are intertwined! If this doesn't touch you, I don't know what will. ",/review/rw1590812/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2013,phd_travel,8," Leonardo's most convincing role
",This is probably Leonardo's most convincing role among the more grown up serious roles of the last few years. In some other roles he looks like a slightly puffy and his boyish face is at odds with the role. But here he seems right and his accent whether accurate or not at least shows some effort to get into a character.,/review/rw1590812/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2007,Smells_Like_Cheese,9," This movie will make you check a jewelery store and wonder if someone was killed over a diamond you've had your eyes on
","I just saw Blood Diamond and I didn't know what to expect, because when I saw the trailer, it just didn't look that exciting to me. I wasn't even sure what this was about, but after the Oscar nods it got and a fantastic review from my friend, I figured that I should check it out. I have to say that this film just broke my heart, it was so good, but so depressing. I never realized how brutal it was to go through these diamond mines, and men turning against their own brothers so quickly, it was so incredibly horrifying to watch and just utterly heart wrenching. But it was so well done and presented, the actors were just incredible and touched my heart, their stories were so uncomfortable and aching to witness, but just so inspirational.",/review/rw1590812/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2007,claudio_carvalho,9," The Price of a Diamond Ring
","In 1999, in Sierra Leone, the fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) dreams on the day that his young son Dia Vandy (Kagiso Kuypers) will become a doctor. His dreams are shattered when the rebels invade his village and kidnap him to work in the diamond mines. Solomon finds a huge pink diamond and while hiding it, the commandant of the rebels sees, but the rebels are attacked and Salomon is arrested by the government army. While in jail, the wounded commandant tell the prisoners that Salomon found the stone, and the mercenary smuggler Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) from Zimbabwe releases Salomon and proposes to exchange the diamond by his missing family. Using the idealistic American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), Danny locates the wife and daughters of Salomon in a refugee camp, but is informed that his son has been recruited by the rebels. Salomon and Danny consolidate a partnership, with Salomon looking for and finding his son, and Danny looking for the diamond and finding redemption.",/review/rw1590812/?ref_=tt_urv

30 January 2007,kosmasp,8," Great Performances
","Whoever still says that Leonardo Di Caprio can't act, must be out of her/his/their mind! Or they're jealous or whatever, but even if I'm not a Leo Fan, I've got to give him credit. He plays his role really great (with dialect and all). Of course you also got J. Connely and D. Hounsou. And some bit players of course. Everyone is great in the movie and if I'm not mistaken the main actor from Tsotsi has a cameo. Although it's a brief appearance it's memorable! (imdb data bank doesn't confirm this, so I can't be sure, but I could swear it was him) :o) The storytelling of the movie is great too. The adventure, the up and downs, everything fits. What's a little disappointing and was the reason why I didn't give this movie 10/10, is that there was something missing to make that movie really great. Can't explain it, but maybe it was a little bit the fact that the movie tried to be to political. The ending was another point for me, where it could've been better. But those are minor things and overall it's a really great movie.",/review/rw1590812/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2020,Xstal,7," Not as Hard as Nails...
","... which is a shame, because if Danny Archer had been anything other than a weak and soft 'Rhodesian' with a dodgy accent I think the film would have been a bit more grounded in reality, that role needed the toughest of the tough to survive in those conditions and poor young Leonardo just didn't cut the mustard. That said, the rest of the tale was sufficient to leave you under no illusion of the events that took place in this part of Africa, the death and destruction as a result and the greed and corruption on other continents that ultimately caused it.",/review/rw1590812/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2007,Boba_Fett1138,6," The movie tries to tell a story but it gets muddled in into its sentiments, action sequences and other Hollywood clichés.
","The problem with ""Blood Diamond"" is that it tries to tell an important and powerful story and even tries to make a statement but it does this too much in an Hollywood kind of way, with over-the-top and far from believable dramatic plot lines, of course a misplaced love-story, lots of action and a happy Hollywood ending. Had the movie been done more in a ""Syriana"", so to speak, kind of style, the movie without doubt would had been better, more powerful and definitely more realistic. No doubt that the movie would then had been one of the year's best.",/review/rw1590812/?ref_=tt_urv
