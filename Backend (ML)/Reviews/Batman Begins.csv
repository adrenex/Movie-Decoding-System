25 January 2019,Eumenides_0,9," The conclusion of a perfect trilogy
",My trusty sidekick IMDB tells me that the last time I bothered to write a review in this website was way back in 2013.,/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2019,NpMoviez,6," Almost what I wanted it to be but not exactly how I wanted it to conclude.
","I am extremely happy that the Eastrail trilogy exists, but I extremely sad about how it chose to go off. I will recommend it, but man, I feel so mixed about it.",/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2019,Chiller7,10," Give James McAvoy every acting award of 2019
","This is a thinking person's movie. It's largely dialogue heavy and not afraid to take its time. It's a movie that takes itself seriously. It's the kind of smart movie that confuses critics who prefer light easy-to-digest popcorn entertainment. When it shifts into full thriller or action mode, brace yourself, because it gets totally intense.",/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2019,cricketbat,5," Left me feeling half empty
","I was completely onboard with Glass for most of the movie, but then it decided to go off the rails. I was invested in the characters and was willing to overlook the clunky exposition and monologuing--until the finale. I feel like M. Night Shyamalan was so determined to surprise the audience that he forgot how to satisfactorily finish a story. To be honest, Glass left me feeling half empty about the whole trilogy.",/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2019,arabnikita,7," If you liked Unbrakable and Split, you will enjoy this one too
","This is not a superhero movie or an action packed sci-fi flick, this is a psychological thriller with people having supernatural abilities...or do they really have these abilities and are they really supernatural?? Just like in Unbreakable and Split, you will have your doubts and theories but in the end it all ends up going in another direction and then another one.",/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2019,Prismark10,8," The signs are there
",You can get a sequel to one film. Glass is a sequel to two different movies that span several decades and different production companies. Split (2016) and Unbreakable (2000).,/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2019,gianthaole,10," Not the Avengers
","Ok, my wife and I just got back from opening night of Glass. We talked about the movie from the end of the movie all the way back home. WOW!!!! We had a lot to talk about. As my title reads this is not an Avengers movie. Do not expect non-stop action. Expect action, story, details, dialogue, emotion, more story, and then some more action. This is a great movie to start off 2019 and James McAvoy deserves an Oscar. Like any M. Night movie you will either love it or hate it. My wife and I LOVED IT!!!!",/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2019,breneff,9," Beautifully weird
","Let me start by saying the critics are just flat out WRONG with this one. And this is coming from a guy who has only enjoyed about half of this guys movies. If you are going in their to watch a superhero movie check yourself at the door. This is a dark twisted psychological horror with a chaotic like thread that reminds you of noir films of the past. It's like a Picasso painting in movie form. The ending is divisive and risky, which I love! It's not for everybody, but I think that's why I loved this movie.",/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2019,LloydBayer,4," As the conclusion to this original superhero trilogy, Glass feels unfinished and empty.
","As with most of his films, Writer-Director M. Knight Shyamalan's widely appreciated trait is to pull the rug under our feet during the film's closing minute. Which is why we all thought Split was a psychological horror film until the last minute, where that final unbroken shot sweeps across a diner until it stops over Bruce Willis' David Dunn. That's when we realised we were watching the sequel to one of Shyamalan's best films - Unbreakable. When Spilt revealed that it existed in the same universe as Unbreakable, it instantly positioned those films as two-thirds of a trilogy. And almost immediately after, Shyamalan revealed that Glass would be the finale to an idea gestating for nearly 20 years. That itself sounds like a labour of love for Shyamalan who not only embraces but also defies popular comic book logic.",/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2019,saarvardi,8," Keep an open mind - and prepare for it to be blown away!
","Wow, Glass actually got me writing a review after many years of absence. So I'll try and keep it short - this movie is most logical and beautiful continuation of the characters and stories we first met in Unbreakable and Split. James McAvoy is a true act of nature, as is Samuel Jackson, and I really loved the fact that Spencer Treat Clark reprised his role as Wilis's son Joseph, 19 years after first portraying him as a kid. It just adds that much authenticity to the story.",/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2019,vinylvanilla,6," The underwhelming closure of what could have been a brilliant trilogy
","I can describe Glass as an entertaining experience, but not solid enough to be an appropriate closure of the Unbreakable-Split-Glass trilogy.",/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2019,Yee_Reviews,7," Underrated by the Critics, but Too Talky & a Little Bit Messy
","Good: The acting across the board from the main cast: James McAvoy, Samuel L. Jackson, and Bruce Willis are great. However, like in ""Split"" McAvoy is definitely the standout portraying so many personalities one after the other is fascinating to watch. Although the setup is great and intriguing, it feels glossed over to get to the main plot. Shyamalan's direction with camera angles and shots also standout and help capture the scenes along with the color scheme as seen in the other movies. I appreciate the overall theme of the movie and the message Shymalan is trying to tell, but suffers in the end and pacing...",/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2019,Top_Dawg_Critic,6," Meh, disappointing as I expected more, much more.
","Not sure what's worse, this film or the fake 9-10/10 reviews.",/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2019,Her-Excellency,10," I admit it. I cried.
","At about fifteen minutes in, I was ready to walk out. It felt so unlike the other two installments. Bruce Willis looked ancient, I thought it would be more of McAvoy reenacting his previous role in this franchise, and Samuel Jackson, well, I've seen a hundred times be Samuel Jackson ...",/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2019,MekkaMax,6," 1/2 Of It Was Good But Mostly Disappointing
",This movie concludes a 19 year trilogy in a mediocre way. There's some good and a lot of bad. Great performances from the cast especially McAvoy carry this movie and make it watchable. Some scenes required him to switch from multiple personalities within seconds of each other. The action is also exciting when it is happening. The camera work is something that is spectacular to look at. The POV shots are immersive and there are some creative uses of color throughout. The first half was interesting and engaging which was good but then you get to the rest of the film.,/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2019,Sleepin_Dragon,9," The critics once again, know nothing!
","If you believed everything that was written by critics, your movie viewing options would be high limited. I'm my opinion they got Glass badly wrong, what's slated for being dull and flawed is actually a terrific movie. It had be captivated, I loved Split, and it literally felt like I was returning to the cinema to watch events directly after that great movie.",/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2019,BA_Harrison,4," Glass < Split < Unbreakable.
","After carefully establishing a new super villain in the form of The Beast (one of the many personalities of Kevin Wendall Crumb) in Split, director M. Night Shyamalan does precisely what I feared he would do with Glass and wastes all of the series' potential. For the majority of this movie's two and a half hours runtime, the three main characters - Crumb (James McAvoy), David Dunn (Bruce Willis) and Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson) - have virtually no interaction and are given very little to do other than to sit and stew in a psychiatric institution where Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson) tries to convince them that they're not so special after all. I can't say I was enthralled by this, but hoped that a blistering final act would make all of the waiting worthwhile. Fat chance...",/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2019,ferguson-6,5," split decision
","Greetings again from the darkness. It's pretty simple. If you are a fan of UNBREAKABLE (2000) and SPLIT (2016), then you need to see this finale to M. Night Shyamalan's trilogy. If neither of the two previous films tickled your creep fancy, then you'll likely find nothing of interest here. The biggest fear is that fans of the first two (like me) will be disappointed and frustrated (like me) by the missed opportunity. Rather than real world super abilities clashing, we get what is mostly a silly letdown.",/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2019,balthier03,10," Im Angry!.. With the critics
","This is the first time that i posted a review in a while, its just because I'm so angry with the critics, I cant stand them to bringing down Shyamalan like this, giving the film a bad word of mouth. This completes his comeback, Critics are crazy giving this even 5/10. I get that the twist won't appeal to some. but for me its a very smart and realistic way to end the series, very grounded ending.",/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2019,thebricks,1," Started out great, ended like a terrible nineties school project
","In spite of the success of Split, this movie was woefully low budget and it showed. The whole film must have taken place during the Trump government shutdown because there is no staff around to watch these three metahumans who are supposed to be incredibly cunning and dangerous. There is one guy and if you take him out, no one will notice for a long time. There is an army of security guys outside who didn't seem to be trained or even interested in doing their job. Guards open gates and don't even give the people walking through them a second look or ask for ID. If this did take place during the government shutdown, it is plausible these guys were retirees asked to volunteer their time. It would make perfect sense given how incompetent they were.",/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2019,confidential-67897,1," A very very bad movie
","I almost walked out, it's that bad.
Could have done so much with these 2 iconic characters coming together but it's just terrible, in the middle of the film about 70 mins go by and nothing happens, literally nothing happens. Definitely the worst film I have seen in the cinema probably ever. Do not waste your money",/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2019,dlynch843,4," M plunges ....again
","Shyamalan's career started with a bang, with a few interesting follow-ups, then wobbled, crashed, wobbled, made the decently scary 'The Visit' and now he sank once again. Good Christ, this movie blew. The last 20 minutes was a ridiculous combination of silliness and pretension. What an unimaginative way of ending the movie. Only good for die-hard (!) M Night fans.",/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2019,trollerbrendan,8," well that was interesting
",Hmmm. Left not knowing whether I liked it or not but when I REALLY thought about I can say I did. Acting was good (even from Willis) and the last 3rd had an iconic Shyamalan sprinkle of genius. Would give it 8.2/10. If you liked the first 2 movies of this trilogy chances are you can enjoy this one.,/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2019,missreneb,2," Disappointing but James McAvoy is Outstanding!!!
","Split was such an excellent film, I cannot understand what happened with this movie. Such a letdown, so disappointing. I hate criticizing M. Night as I really love most of his films yet Glass was just plain dumb. Very poorly written, so ridiculous with zero believability. I think what made Split so outstanding was that there was a strong level of believably in the character and the insanity and supernatural aspects unfolded at a great pace. With Glass, it was plain stupid from the gitgo and proceeded to get worse as it went on. For me its only Unbreakable with an outstanding followup of Split and that is it. Sorry.",/review/rw5306330/?ref_=tt_urv
