26 August 2020,PsychoBeard666,6," Season 1 was good. Season 2 was a mess.
",I just binged both seasons and if they don't make another season I'd be absolutely fine with that.,/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2021,rochfordsimon,5," Loved Season 1, by Season 3 ep2 I'm bored.
","Thoroughly enjoyed Season 1. So much going on and endless 'What If?"" scenarios. So many religious & cultural backgrounds. Some brilliant characters too. They were all rallying together for the coming WAR.",/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2020,arfdawg-1,5," Thumbs Up to S1. S2 is a Downer
","Wow.
Season One was so good. I'd give it an 8.",/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2019,minnickmatt,," No comparison to season 1
",Season 2 is so horrible and slow. Just seem to drag every episode out.,/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2019,confidential-67897,1," Just really boring
","Nothing happened for 99% of each episode; it's extremely boring, how this show hasn't been cancelled is beyond me",/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2019,hammer-20151,2," They will not recover after season2
",I understand the concepts about setting up a show but this is the biggest waste of a season on such talented actors they might as well cancel the show season three would have to be mind blowing right out of the gate for me to watch it again this is a whole lot about a whole Lotta nothing what a shame the writers are atrocious. Sad actually.,/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2020,linkedin-12192,," It takes god-like stamina to keep watching this
","It seems that each episode is trying to out awe the last leaving the viewer just wondering where it is all going at such a pace. No surprise then that it all lost its steam later on. Yes, we get it with the mystery and suspense but that needs kindling and careful character development. Instead it looks like production team were split on how best to achieve this - did they all read the book?",/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2021,kierran89,5," A Uniquely Bad Show (that could have been great)
",Just finished season 3 and...I've come to the end of my tether with this show. I can't recall ever watching a show that willyfully wastes amazing potential season after season.,/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2019,misimester-58376,2," What even was the point of season 2??
","It never even tried to give an answer to the pre-existent questions and only really seemed to drag out, giving way to more questions that will, at the end of the day, not be answered....",/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2021,flowirin,3," Season 1 is epic. Recommended. Then go read the book, because the rest is junk
",This series is the prefect example of the 'woke' disease that is destroying entertainment media.,/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2021,dpugh-73430,4," Season 1 was 9/10 season 2 is 2/10
","Season 1 was absolutely incredible, it's a solid 9 in my book and could have moved to a 10 with the next season, but unfortunately after firing Bryan Fuller the show pretty much went down the toilet. First they lost 2 of my favorite characters, the great Gillian Anderson as Media, and Kristin Chenoweth as Easter who had a ton of potential! But apparently they left because Fuller was let go, so we didn't get to see either of them again. Plus this season is just super boring....I'm on episode 5 and feel like nothing has happened, like at all, it's been a complete waste thus far. The last episode all of a sudden turned into some weird race war of gods that came out of the blue with zero provocation or context. I don't even understand what they were trying to accomplish with that or how it made any sense. Honestly it's hard to stay awake watching this season, and the 1st literally had me glued to the TV. Major disappointment.",/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv

",You lose your creator and biggest stars and replace them with woke bull crap.,/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2017,Leofwine_draca,4," A weird concoction
",Review of Season One:,/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2019,AbsentMinded256,1," Season 1 Great... Season 2 Garbage...
",Season 1 built up some great potential. I was really looking forward to season 2 and all the new gods that might be recruited and the ensuing battle(s) that might take place. But season 2 is just a bunch of boring babble that means nothing and takes the story nowhere. It's incredibly slow and unrelated to the first season's build up. Starz...You're nothing without good writers. Get a clue.,/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2021,rochfordsimon,5," Looks like its gonna be cancelled after season 3.
","Season 1 = 0.28 rating in 18-49 yr olds & 714,000 viewers an episode.
Season 3 (5 episodes in) = 0.04 rating in 18-49 yr olds & 176,000 viewers an episode.",/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2019,randyunseen,1," What Happened to American Gods
","I'm still in shock from watching Season 2 of American Gods. What happened. Did anybody at Stars, watch all the episodes before this was released to the waiting fans of Season 1.
How can you ruin such a great Series like American Gods. I'm mad at the top echelon at Stars for letting this happen. Shame on you! You have a lot of competition out there. I hope you wake up and start putting out more entertaining media. I think I'm gonna cancel my Stars subscription....",/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2019,mrbwiz422,4," Season 2 is just awful. If you are curious what happens just don't.
",If you are curious on what happens just don't.... It is not worth spending time on.,/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2019,purnendutudu,1," Season 2
","Season 2 is a snoozefest. Nothing happens ever. Though season 1 was compelling, season 2 doesn't even further the storytelling. Season 2 might be the last straw that breaks the camels back. It's very much ""meh"".",/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2021,gijack25,1," Canceled Starz
",Loved season 1 and season 2 was good. The great characters and actors that made the show great changed. Watched two episodes and canceled my stars subscription. Thats how bad it was.,/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2021,illirianimage,5," Decent first season. The rest, not so much.
",I found the first season to be interesting. It was wierd and mysterious but now with a third season it still has'nt gotten anywhere. Just more of the same. Every scene looks like something we have already been shown multiple times and it gets harder and harder to suffer the wait for the promised war. I am very likely to just give up on this show. I would not have been this impatient if all of season 2 and now season 3 did not feel this much like they are just meant to drag things out.,/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2019,analogue1001,," If there was a god of disappointment........
","I am not sure what has gone wrong with season 2, but it is like someone has taken all the deleted scenes from season 1 and created a new season from them. That is the quality of season 2, the majority of scenes are dull, lifeless, and certainly don't contain any of that god like ""magic"" that season 1 certainly had.",/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2021,Nemesis42,4," The War that never comes.
","Despite a great first season, the rest is disappointing. The major event that the series is focused upon never happens. After three seasons you would think that war they are preparing for would be included. The third season just drags on. If all seasons were as compelling as the first, then this would be a 10 out of 10.
It;s been a waste of time.",/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2019,cherold,7," Liked season 1, gave up in season 2
","A lot of people raved about the first season of American Gods, but my response was more measured. I watched at first just because it's ponderous, mysterious style was unusual for TV. But I wasn't really engaged until a few episodes in when Emily Browning's Laura Moon burst in like a storm. She kept me going through the less entrancing parts of the show, which could be unpleasant and some tedious, *endless* sex scenes.",/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2019,westsideschl,4," Continuity
","First, the writers/directors should realize that viewers are a year away from the previous season so clarity & continuity is important for understanding & enjoyment, and possibly a bit more simplicity (KISS). I've sort of lost track of the story's main theme. Even within this season we seemed to go off on tangents; jumped about as far as subplots. One needs to go online & consult a guide to know what's going on. Not much support in terms of CGI although the real House on a Rock set & props is probably the highlight.",/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2019,c-figueroa10,3," Season 2 is horrible.
","Season two is a complete mess & the story is not progressing whatsoever. What a shame because season one had a lot of pontential to carry over strong but that is not the case here. Seems like the writers are lost, I think it will be cancelled after this season.",/review/rw4773469/?ref_=tt_urv
