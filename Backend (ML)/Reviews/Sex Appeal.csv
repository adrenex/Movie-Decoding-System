7 October 2019,alfredsmith,9," Just watch first season
","The first season of ""The Terror"" is superb. I binge watched it over three nights and I regard it as essential viewing. There are many great reviews here so I won't bother with much detail but it is brilliant TV. Marvelous characters and a great story set in the eerie Arctic. However, I must say the second season is a completely different story that is poor viewing and is so bad that you should simply give it a miss. So as far as ratings go, season one deserves 10/10 and season two barely deserves 2/10, but the first season is so good it makes the average 9/10.",/review/rw4967785/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2018,childers-3,8," Atmospheric and creepy
","This miniseries about two crews looking for a passage from England to India and China through the frozen north is very promising. I watched the first installment last night and was impressed with the acting, story and characters. I will watch future episodes in the dark. My tv doesn't have the best picture and I feel I may have missed some very subtle moments. It is beautifully filmed and the acting is top notch! I just wish I had a better tv! This series deserves it.",/review/rw4967785/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2019,interaxcontracts,6," Telling it the way it is.......Season 1 a must! Season 2 a bust......!

4 April 2018,lquinlan-17636,10," My new favorite current show!
","So when I describe this show to people, I can't help but throw it into the category of quality tv with the likes of Breaking Bad, Fargo, The Sopranos.... This miniseries is well written and developed with caliber acting. I will be quite surprised if this show isn't up for a ton of nominations during award season. ",/review/rw4967785/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2018,mohahaa13,9," A frigid voyage
","Going into the series with no expectations or impressions from the novel, and barely reading about the series at all before binge watching it, i was expecting a high paced master and commander type of series. And while it's set in roughly the same time period, it's unlike anything i was expecting. It's quite suspenseful and chilling. Much thanks to the great acting, casting and details. The ambient soundtrack (R.I.P Marcus Fjellström) is fantastic and really helps with the eerie feeling. There were some moments it made me feel really at unease.
Right up there with the top series for sure. Well worth a watch.",/review/rw4967785/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2021,Sleepin_Dragon,9," A Deadly Voyage.
","This is a remarkable (first) series, which takes on a journey of suspicion, disaster, tragedy and terror. The first episode didn't exactly captivate me, but by episode three I was obsessed, and subsequently had to binge watch the whole series.",/review/rw4967785/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2018,SnoopyStyle,8," great first season
","This is a fictionalization of Captain Sir John Franklin's lost expedition to find the northwest passage through the Arctic in 1845-1848. He has two ships, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, filled with the latest technology. Captain Francis Crozier (Jared Harris) piloted the Terror and led the expedition after the death of Franklin (Ciarán Hinds).",/review/rw4967785/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2018,Liberty-AstonMartin,10," Chilling and Atmospheric
","The Terror's compelling story is perfectly supported by the dark, chilling, and perfectly eerie atmosphere. The veteran cast members, usually seen on UK shows, are excellent. Particularly, Harris and Menzies carry the weight of their character's situation very well. This show is mildly high brow in a good way. Fans of Taboo, Fortitude, Requiem, and Trapped may enjoy. The tension and chill is wonderful. Absolutely love this program.",/review/rw4967785/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2019,abampi,9," Season 1 ONLY
","I really can't understand why AMC decided to use the same title for two completely different series without any relation between each other (new plot, new directors, new actors...) - it's confusing, misleading, totally pointless.
Given the above: the first season is a masterpiece. One of the top 4-5 series of the year.
This second season is a very average product, deserving 6, maximum 7/10.
Pointless to rate them together with a shared vote.",/review/rw4967785/?ref_=tt_urv

1 April 2018,steveo122,8," Excellent casting of faces.
","Excellent casting of faces.
If you have appreciation for historically plausible details of the great British era of naval discovery and good writing of lines that are spoken by actors who know how to deliver them, this is wonderful.
'The Terror' is the name of one of the ships, so I don't know how the 'horror' is going to play out but, 'supernatural creep' is definitely in play.
I have no doubt that it will be 'quality'.
Right now I'm thinking along the lines of 'Patrick O'Brian meets Stephen King'",/review/rw4967785/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2019,unbrokenmetal,8," Death Wish?
","In 1845, the Franklin expedition meets their doom when searching for the northwest passage. Doom not only caused by the cold, hunger, sickness and mutiny, but also by a hideously malformed polar bear that keeps chasing them and kills expedition members on a regular basis during each episode.",/review/rw4967785/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2018,a-alfstad,9," This is how to do a book justice!
","This is a review for the series premiere:
 
 This is a strong start for a series based on one of my favorite books. The book was great, but it was longer than a Stephen King book and that's saying something, but the series has an efficient feel to it while still staying true to the book. You can tell that there is some true love for the source material and it really shows in every aspect, especially the cast. I love all the casting choices so far, but Adam Nagaitis as Cornelius Hickey is looking to be an amazing choice. His portrayal is spot on thus far and I can't wait to see his character dive further into the rabbit hole. 
 I'm also impressed with how well they translated the atmosphere from the book to the series so accurately. I just hope the monster is given the same kind of love that every other aspect of the series has been given so far.
 Ultimately, if you've read the book, then you should love the series. If you haven't read the book, you just might find yourself wanting to.",/review/rw4967785/?ref_=tt_urv

27 March 2018,jeffyoung1,10," Riveting, suspenseful, never dull. Must see.
","I relish a good, dark, atmospheric suspense, thriller, mystery, horror story set in the claustrophobic confines of a plane, a train, the limits of a circus and in this mini-series, two, early 19th century British exploration wooden ships. This story has a slight variance. Because both ships become stuck fast in unrelenting, Arctic ice, there is also action and suspense out on the ice and the land. I knew from watching the preview that this was going to be a riveting, entertaining yarn based on real history, the disastrous British Artic Northwest Passage Franklin expedition of 1845-47 in which both exploration ships disappeared along with their men without a trace. This was clever. Why invent a new tale when a writer can simply invoke history for the overall plot story? It worked to me. True, the storyline here offers little real mystery. It's a mythical monster movie meshed with a disastrous British exploration naval expedition story. But if you want to know what happens, you have to watch it. So far the characters in the mini-series are very good. It's early in the series but so far no one, major or minor character, shows any stereotypical villainous traits. There's disagreement and friction of course, but no back-stabbing and everyone generally works together, which is something rare in these kinds of movies where human conflict is introduced to ramp up the tension and storyline. In reality people will tend to cooperate for their mutual survival and this is what I see. It proves important because they will be fighting for their survival, not just from the hostile climate and terrain, but from a deadly, ferocious animalistic force given shape and form out on the dark, barren ice. Can't wait to see the next episodes. I even watched the rerun that followed the conclusion of the two-part introduction.
For those who enjoy history even with a twist of the paranormal, The Terror's storyline plays closely to the actual historical, disastrous Franklin Expedition of 1845-47. You see a far more modern and professional British navy than 50 years ago where treatment of sailors and discipline were amongst the most extreme. There are no captain Blighs here in the near mid-19th century. The British Admiralty promotes men to ship captaincy still on professionalism and as much now on their ability to lead and motivate men based on sound leadership that is more respectful and caring of their men's welfare, and not by the cat o' nine tails lash in the last century. British society still retains its strict class distinctions as shown on the British ships, but all the naval officers are humane professionals that care for the welfare of the enlisted sailors and lead by professionalism and being out in front. You won't find a single sadistic officer in this mini-series so far. All the men, officers, noncommissioned (petty) officers, and enlisted (ratings) share a common bond of adventure, danger, and impending disaster, that thus far keeps them together. The storyline, from its very first episode, hints and predicts the breakdown of even the best organized ship crews when overwhelming disaster strikes and tears apart the strongest bonds among men. When it becomes every man for himself, the end is truly in sight. The Terror essentially tells you from the first episode what's going to happen. The entertainment is waiting each Monday to see how the unfolding disaster plays out to the men and ships of the Artic expedition, all to disappear without a trace.
Over the past eighteen years, bits and pieces of the actual, vanished exploration have turned up. National Geographic back in the early 2000s did a feature story of the discovery of the first few victims, who perished early in the expedition before disaster overtook it entirely. The burial showing the deceased sailor, David Young, depicted him down to accurate detail as was shown in the actual coffin unearthed in the pages of National Geographic. Several years ago, radar wave mapping of the ocean floor discovered what scientists think is most likely one of the two vanished British exploratory ships.",/review/rw4967785/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2018,salnm,7," Good, but had potential to be spectacular.
","Like others, I am a bit disappointed by the show. The production levels, scene/scenario setting, and especially the performances (every actor was absolutely topnotch) were all very commendable. However, the initial trailer promised a bit more than the overall project delivered. Was hoping the series would be strictly a psychological thriller, based on the frailty of the mind and the fracture of relationship/bonds when put under tremendous stress.

","So I managed to make it through to the end of this interminable slog - I don't know why, other than through sheer bloodymindedness and wanting to see if it actually went anywhere. Turns out it doesn't. The majority of the final two episodes I was actually watching on fast forward. It made little difference: just long, long shots of people walking over rocks not saying anything.",/review/rw4967785/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2018,cburgess-80067,10," Excellent horror/suspense
","The show draws you in immediately. It feels a lot like the first Alien movie with its atmosphere and general sense of dread (it even steals a scene from the movie). After only two episodes it's the only thing on right now, for me, that's a must-watch. The characters are well-written and multi-dimensional. The story is intriguing. Really looking forward to see how it plays out.",/review/rw4967785/?ref_=tt_urv
