30 November 2021,ksf-2,7," silly but fun
","The more the merrier or... where two meet .. in spanish. Club Paradiso in spain, where you leave your feelings behind, according to their slogan. It's all about pleasure. A swingers club! And apparently, this lady who is to be married was here last night, and lost her engagement ring. So it's a treasure hunt to try and find it. One guy in a suit and tie says he doesn't want to be here, but he never seems to leave. It's a nutty night, and there's no real plot. Kind of like the ritz... its a night out at the sex club. A whole lot of boobs. Doesn't seem to be rated, since it's on netflix. Kissing and simulated sex. But about halfway through, everyone starts talking. And discussing. An emotional connection instead of sexual. Class, what have we learned here tonight? Its good. Directed by paco caballero.",/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2021,lareval,7," A pleasent surprise
","Kinky and hot, with a great casting giving good performances and a nice pacing make this fun comedy even better than I have ever expected. So much fun done surprisingly right.",/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2021,albertval-69560,6," Attempt is Commendable
","The message of this story in the eyes of the script writer is clear: we should respect each other's sexual drives because there is no shame in it. And he expounds this through different storylines, including 2 married couples, a gay couple, cousins, and a woman who's getting married the day after.",/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2021,kigaiyuuto,7," No La Revolucion Sexual but it's fine
",An R-rated version of Shortbus. It's impossible to reach total abandon like in that movie since the actors are quite well-known. The first name on the credit even didn't lose his clothing until the final and mid-credit scene.,/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2021,JeanFlores-Dickens,6," Well done Spain
","Obviously not an American movie,
they would never done it, too prude. The story is somehow believable and entertaining, not only that but the movie is funny and the ending truly is what it's mean to be.",/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2021,cmeyrick-81389,9," Bonkers but great fun
","Like many Spanish films, this is weirdly bonkers. But once you get past halfway it all comes together nicely and you find yourself caring for all the characters and their romantic outcomes.",/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2022,robinhio84_,7," Great watch for sexually openminded people
","Make sure ur conservative family members are out of the room. Coz, yes this movie is about SEX! And different people have different approaches to that.",/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2021,qui_j,2," Rubbish!
","This movie, like many others from Spain, relies on a lot of nudity and on screen sex to sell it. It falls flat. After 20 minutes it went straight into the basurero!",/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2021,ops-52535,9," the world is my oyster (hahahahahahaha)
","The vocalist of ''frankie goes to hollywood'' sang at the end of the track called ''welcome to the pleasuredome''(Direct! ) in 1984, and that lgbtq+ inspired song from back then really matches the contents of this novel spanish netflix production.",/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2022,susantos-84789,7," One thing made it off for me
","I love European movies because there's usually no taboos. I was pretty excited about this one, it's sex and that's it...it's just a movie to have fun and relax and enjoy with your partner. However one thing on the movie completely turned me off: the cousins. Cmon...that's a bit excessive. No matter how open minded you are that just felt very awkward like incest type of thing. Could be a 10 if it weren't for that.",/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2022,kosmasp,7," Let's talk about Sex baby
","Let's talk about you and me ... let's talk about all the good things and the bad things that may be ... let's talk about ... well the more the merrier I reckon, yes? Because this movie is about intercourse ... it is about the most fun thing or pasttime we can have. Ok one of the most fun, I'm not trying to take anything away from any other fun activity you consider even a better use of your time.",/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2021,thesaintcouk,1," Hard to see it through to the end
","There is no word that can define how bad this movie is, incoherent, awkward and without coherence.",/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2022,yosoyanonim,3," Nothing compaired with the trailer
",There must be laws against the movie trailer makes that generate high expectations hiding mediocre stories.,/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2021,estebanav,1," Absolutely boring
","I just finished it and I still don't know which is the story behind. It's not about sexual liberation, something that happened many years ago in the developed countries, it's not about the free love, not funny situations. A complete waste of time... Another Netflix movie.",/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2022,badgood-34356,10," Best movie with amazing message on Netflix
",One of the best bold movies on Netflix. The message at the end of the movie is so true and relatable.,/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2022,GiraffeDoor,6," Sex is a thing that exists.
",I'm always game for a sex positive story but I'm equally wary about how obnoxious they can be.,/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2021,virat-sin,2," Disgusting and silly
",The message in the movie is somewhat okay but the execution is terrible and painful to watch. The incest plot was outright disgusting. The gay plot was at least properly acted.,/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2021,eszembej,1," Disgusting
","Lesson of the movie: Forget your morals, and become a wild pig. Have sex with everyone/everything you're into. It dosent matter if your wedding is on the next day, if you have a family, if it's your close relative. Just do it! This is the solution! At least this is what most of the protagonists of the movie show you.",/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,v-86934,5," hmmm
","Let say there's many character that I can't catch up like who's the main character. I'm mainly interested in a group 4 people in the house they play games truth or dare and it's enjoyable to watch. Unfortunately there's some more scenario that I can't wrap my head around, example there's suddenly dramatic part like who are they and why they even matter in this movie what role they're playing.",/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2021,wassilyml,1," Hard to watch
",Very forced. Not very funny. Incest promotion. The movie seems to have forgotten boundaries.,/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2022,pembekeci,6," Provocative
",Movie is full of lust but surprisingly nobody hurts any other one. This is very encouraging for people not to cheat.,/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2021,maxbalshoi,6," Funny although silly
",Nothing special but some funny scenes. The only thing did not match was that gay story in the swingers club which had nothing to do with reality.,/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2021,wiktor-06402,4," Ok
","The film is correct at first, but it's still lacking to average, it doesn't stand out with anything, it's not very emotional. It is much more toned down and censored, in fact we can see two women showing their breasts as well as their face in the first part and towards the end. The lesbian sex is blurred (a vague image, as if through a fog) in the background, and we see one of the main characters in the foreground. Then we only see a woman's breasts as she kisses another woman, thus obscuring her face. The two main characters are caught at the end of sex as they hug each other in such a way that we see one's back and the other's face only. The rest of the actors also have their genitals obscured, for example, by covering up sex thanks to a shirt. The two women who have sex with their boyfriends obscure their breasts with their hands. In fact at the end there is the most excitement when we can see the actors half naked which saves the film, most of the time it is talking and kissing. No complete nudity of the actors is shown.",/review/rw7682902/?ref_=tt_urv
