21 February 2017,Maladjusted_1,10," The greatest gaming experience of my life
","When I finish a game, I never start it again straight away, typically leaving at least a few weeks between playthroughs. Often I never even return to it. 'The Witcher 3' was the exception. As soon as I completed it, I launched it again on Death March (i.e. very hard) difficulty, and began my journey once again. Why did I break my habit of shelving a completed game? The answer: 'The Witcher 3' has *everything*.",/review/rw6726371/?ref_=tt_urv

",This is not simply a game! I have some amazing fond memories with this game! The theme music of Ard skellige is still my PS theme music and when I finished the game I travelled back to Ard skellige and just stood there taking in all the beautiful scenery and reminiscing of all the hours I spent living in the witcher world!,/review/rw6726371/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2015,petra_ste,10," Lives up to the hype
","See, I enjoyed The Witcher 2 (TW2) as much as the next guy (stupid Kayran boss fight notwithstanding), but I felt the game wasn't as great as the first title of the series, the developers' eye-popping debut. So, although perfectly fine in its own right, it felt like a small step backwards. (Okay, so maybe I did enjoy it slightly less than the next guy).",/review/rw6726371/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's kind of a funny story of how the Witcher 3 came out. The last time I saw such hype for a fantasy RPG was when Skyrim came out in late 2011. It seemed that everyone was talking about that game when it came out, and of course it received critical acclaim",/review/rw6726371/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2015,kylerescutia,10," Magnificent: One of the best games I have ever played
","Wow. This game is truly astounding. I went into playing this game not really knowing what to expect, although I had heard good things about it. I have never played any of the first two Witcher games either. I have to admit, it was a weird transition from Bloodborne to the Witcher 3 because of the significant difference in pacing. However, they're two completely different games and the Witcher certainly proved itself to me. From the amazing sceneries to the engaging story, this game is definitely praiseworthy. However, the most compelling part of the story for me was definitely the characters. The character development in this game is amazing, and I truly began to feel a sense of comfort and love for nearly all of the characters. I loved the characters and lore of this game so much, in fact, that I actually played through the game multiple times, covering the main story and various side quests. It is very easy to put in over 150 hours into this game, as I have put in at least 500. Furthermore, I bought all of the books that the game series was based on and I am currently reading them with delight. If buying the entire book series simply because the game was incredible doesn't convince you that this is definitely a worthy buy, then I don't know what will. This game does not fail to impress and I can't wait for the upcoming DLCs. Hopefully you give it a shot, because it is definitely worth your time and money. Congrats to CD Projekt Red for creating such a magnificent experience with the Witcher 3.",/review/rw6726371/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2015,MajorBaleegh,10," RPG at its Best
","On 19th May 2015, the third installment of ""The Witcher"" series was launched. I downloaded the same on 20th May 2015 and started playing. I have also completed ""The Witcher 2 Assassin's of Kings"" as well so keeping in mind the past experience I really enjoyed playing the new game. Geralt of Rivia, also known as white wolf along with Triss and Yen was a beautiful story line with scenic picturesque, excellent melody and intense fight scenes and I loved the game very much. It took me 8 days 6 hours 4 minutes 27 seconds to complete the game in all. So a total of 198 hours game play which is a lot to reach level 34. I have completed 220 quests out of which 14 quests were partly failed and one quest which was completed earlier was a failed quest after that specific quest was complete it was Cave of Dreams. Seven quests of Gwent game and five quests of horse races were not completed by me so in total there were 232 all quest including main, side and treasure hunts. I have downloaded the games original soundtrack and the music is fantastic. I love the game very much.",/review/rw6726371/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2021,razzakahmed,9," The Witcher World at it's best
","The reason the Witcher games have gotten the highest ratings possibly for any games is mainly because you can do anything in this game. You can wear anything, you can go anywhere, choose anything, weaponise anything, utilize the general accessories to it's maximum, increase your mutation powers, it's over detailed. But many things one surely needs to recheck in order to find it maybe from the internet. Certain items or certain ingredients. The glamorous world of the thirteenth century sparks magnificently. It has an elite line up of monsters and characters along with it's in-depth details . Which oil and which ingredient will work on which monster and how to enhance and craft and dismantle and it goes on and on . This is the biggest game I've ever played content and detail wise .. I've never collected more collectables in any other game than in this game . They've created sort of almost like an infinite universe in which the more you explore the lesser it is .. quite fascinating and a remarkable achievement for a video game . I wrote all this for the whole Witcher 3 Wild Hunt game.",/review/rw6726371/?ref_=tt_urv

30 April 2018,vladacokorilo,10," Brilliant...Simply brilliant! ,,Return of The King"" of video game history
","Ever since the Lord of The Rings trilogy, I've said to myself that I will never see anything so epic that will be remembered for generations to come. It's a rare thing these days that something can leave such a strong impression on it's fans and usually shape their emotions from time to time. Fortunately, I was wrong. Witcher 3 is a not only a great video game when it comes to story and gameplay, it simply stands as it's own type of masterpiece which words cannot describe how good it is. 
With the first Witcher being a solid start for the franchise to introduce the newcomers to the witcher universe and Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings being a great sequel which fixed the mistakes of the first game and adding more debt to the story and plot progression, Witcher 3 The Wild Hunt is an epic conclusion to an epic saga (much like Return of The King) which started out from a lesser known book series in Poland to a mainstream video game franchise known by many fans worldwide.

17 March 2018,evgeny_k,10," One of the best games in history
","It does not matter, if you enjoy mostly RPGs or not, it does not matter where you are from, it does not matter whether you have read the books or not. This game will surely grasp you and make you love it from the start ! The story itself is the key to giving this title a 10/10. The best films, the best anecdotes and the best PC games all have something in common - the STORY has to be one of high-quality and has to sound believable /even if it might be in fanstasy setting.../ This game will tell you a story that is very very emotional and emersive, to some exent funny, to some extent sad, to some extent truly grand. And those graphics - this is one more reason to play the WITCHER 3. It is simply too amazing not to see it ! The beauty and the variety of lands, buildings, faces and moves surely is more than enough. One more thing - the minor characters are smart and never out of place. Sometimes, minor NPCs build the foundations of a game, and this time it happens with a finesse that is rarely seen. The ending is the other great Yesman if you are sitting on a table and asking yourself ""Hmmmm, should I play this?"". The ending is not what one might expect ... So be ready to be amazed ! Not to mention, the skill tree of the main character is pretty cool, too.
The only negative feeling I had while playing this RPG was that some side quests were not so interesting and that there was too much rolling in fighting stronger enemies.",/review/rw6726371/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2019,singhvatsalya,10," One Of The Best Game Out There , Must Play
","This is an AWESOME OPEN WORLD Game !!!
I love the game for it's level of details and the type of quest it offers.
This has to be one of the best open world game I or anyone has played.
And the combat is just so satisfying you can't get enough of it....
The story took me about 60 hours to beat but it was worth it.
The game has 3 main endings which vary depending on what choices you make during your playthrough.
This game is like Game Of Thrones of video games...",/review/rw6726371/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2018,deaeight,10," Absolute Masterpiece
","I've been gaming since the mid eighties and before this, Skyrim was my favourite game. I still can't get my head around how much better this is than Skyrim. It borrows some of its ideas from Skyrim, sure, but those ideas are just the seasoning to what is an incredibley satisfying and delicious meal. They have done the impossible with the size of the world and the detail contained therein, as well as how visually spectacular it looks. Jaw dropping! There are a few too many cut scenes for my liking but you can skip through them if you want which is good. No other flaws that I can report! EASILY the best action RPG to date. When I say easily, nothing else is in the same league! It is absolutely untouchable. Speaking of the competition, Horizon Zero Dawn?? OMG What a total rip off of this game that was (just executed no where near as well!). I'm surprised CD Projekt Red didn't sue! This has been out for 3 years now and nothing since has come close to its depth, complexity, immersion and attention to detail. An unbelievable achievement technically and creatively. Truly breathtaking.",/review/rw6726371/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is the best game I've ever played. I have never been more invested into a plot and sub plots as much as this. Skyrim was my favorite, which is still amazing. However the Witcher 3 takes you onto a higher level you wouldn't even know was possible. You care so much about these characters that you will find yourself reloading earlier save files because you've upset a character you didn't want to upset.",/review/rw6726371/?ref_=tt_urv

","This game is epic in scope. Truly beautiful. Countless monsters and even more monstrous men. Geralt is very memorable as a protagonist for the development he makes as a man over the course of the series, much more so than in the book series from which this is based.
