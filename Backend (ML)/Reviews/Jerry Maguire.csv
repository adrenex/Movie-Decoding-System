18 March 2018,Platypuschow,7," Never Hike Alone: Very impressive fan film
","Not that you'd know by the cover but Never Hike Alone is a Friday 13th fan film, in fact it's hard to believe since the whole thing looks so darn professional.",/review/rw5002480/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2018,joeyljohnson1,9," Jason Lives...Again!
","Wow! I have seen a few ""fan films"" and they can often be fun but amateurish. This flick manages to set the bar very high for any fan films that may follow. If you're a fan of the franchise then you will love this well-made addition. It might not be perfect but it has more heart than a lot of horror movies coming out of Hollywood and deserves accolades. For Jason's sake....give this man a feature film!!",/review/rw5002480/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2018,coolpool-00809,7," Very impressive, well made, but a little flawed the last few minutes
","This film was incredible. Unlike the other films of the series, this impressive piece of work relied mostly on suspense and even some psychological horror rather than a huge kill count, and it succeeds because it actually is pretty scary. But with that said, there are some graphic wounds and there are two deaths. A man gets a hatchet to the chest, he is seen stumbling into the middle of a road and bleeds to death. This is pretty graphic. A girl is pulled put of an ambulance and is bashed against the side of the vehicle off scree, but her corpses is shown from a distance. The ambulance driver is pulled out of the car and is attacked by Jason (offscreen) but he survives. The main character is attacked constantly by Jason. He is stabbed, beaten, even thrown out a second story ""door that goes nowhere."" They explain it in the movie. Jason even torments him psychologically, appearing in his dreams, including a pretty well made special effect of Jason crushing his head. The hero stabs Jason in the neck with an axe, blue blood leaks from his mask and wound, but it has no real effect on him. I really liked this movie, it was well made and very suspenseful. The only real problem I had was how I felt that the ending was rushed. I didn't understand how Jason didn't kill the ambulance driver, but then again, it could have been that Jason was distracted by his friend trying to help him, but to me it felt like that random biker Jason butchered in Part 3 only for him to somehow be alive at the end without a scratch. But I did overall enjoy this fan film. It was well made, had some pretty cool special effects, and overall a great story line. I did enjoy the modern twists to this film series. It is actually better than most Friday films.",/review/rw5002480/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2017,ksfsu7,8," Fun way of returning to Camp Crystal Lake
",Going into this knowing it was a fan made story and shortened I was sure what to expect but it delivered on a fun way of rediscovering the camp. There were plenty of throwback moments and details that made the wandering around the camp suspenseful and the movie does a great job building until Jason arrives.,/review/rw5002480/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2017,Sokywocky,8," Surprisingly good for a fan film
",While the official Friday the 13th movie set for release today was cancelled this is a worthy replacement.,/review/rw5002480/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2018,kingjoneva,8," Kudos for this effort.
","I saw one bad review and figured that being an indie film maybe this was an honest review and all the other reviews were possibly friends of the filmmakers or cast mates trying to get some positive ratings on IMDB. I'm glad that I decided to take a chance and give this nice little gem a look for myself. I have no idea what that reviewer's problem was, but this was actually a very entertaining fan film. The build up to the confrontation between the main character and Jason was well done. And the fight scenes were actually quite entertaining. I would really like to see what these people are able to accomplish in the future if someone will give them a decent budget and a good script. Well done and keep up the good work.",/review/rw5002480/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2019,Marynewcomb2013,7," Well done!!
","Very surprised at how good this fan film is!!! This is well wrote, shot, edited, directed & acted!!! I have seen some other fan films & this is the only one that is a top notch film!!! Me personally, I think this is better than the franchise movies from part 7 on!!
Anyone out there wanting to do their own fan film, watch this one first & see how to do it!! I say this because I watched Return To Crystal Lake before I watched this movie & the first was nothing but a joke!! It's like they just threw together some people and filled in the blanks with those people while filming Return!! That is a very poorly done film!!!
Again guys, very well done on Never Hike Alone!!!",/review/rw5002480/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2018,Stevieboy666,7," Impressive production
","A hiker takes his camcorder to a nature reserve & embarks on a long hike but soon stumbles across Camp Crystal Lake from Friday the 13th. It may be all dilapidated but he's not alone....
This is a fan movie which could well spell trouble but in this case we get some rather excellent production values. There's much impressive camera work, making great use of the beautiful countryside, it's well acted, packs some suspense and the make -up is of a high quality. It even stars Thom Matthews reprising his role as Tommy Jarvis. The only downside for me was that for most of the film there are only two characters, the hiker and Jason, and even at only 54 minutes long it did feel like an over stretched chase sequence. But that's just a minor quibble.
As a fan I'd love to see some new Friday movies but until then this will do nicely. Well done!",/review/rw5002480/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2017,jasonisageek,10," A Back To Basics Friday the 13th Film That Packs A Punch
","We can all agree that most horror franchises lose a fair amount of steam at some point. Michael, Leatherface, Pinhead and Freddy all suffered from too many bad sequels, and Jason is no exception. Honestly, the last great Friday the 13th film was Part 6: Jason Lives.....31 years ago. Sure, people tend to love some of the others that followed for various reasons, but most certainly not because they're great horror films. Enter writer/director/actor Vincente DiSanti, who spearheaded a Kickstarter campaign in 2016 to fund an originally estimated short 22 minute fan-film. With an enticing teaser trailer and fantastic incentives, it's no surprise that they surpassed their goals, which might explain why it turned into a 55 minute film rather than the original 22. Anyway, here we are in October of 2017, with the film brilliantly being released for FREE all over the world on.....wait for it......Friday the 13th! Amazing. Let's dig in.",/review/rw5002480/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2017,hellraiser7,10," Night Hike
","I'm a fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise, this film just like Jason I honestly didn't see coming but once it came it was one of the best surprises. Fan films have always been hit or miss with me, but this film is thankfully one of those hits.",/review/rw5002480/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2021,forthemovies,8," WELL WRITTEN FAN FILM
","Really impressed with this fan film directed by
Vincente DiSanti who also plays Jason Voorhees. Story is well written with alot of suspense and thrills throughout the film. I was also impressed with the cinamatography which in my opinion gave a blair witch mood to the film.",/review/rw5002480/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2021,arachnid-50159,1," It's ok if you like movies about walking around
","Meh ðŸ˜•, Jason lumbers around and some guy avoids it... Coulda done better. It was ok but, staying awake was hard to do. The only reason this film was remotely interesting was the alumni in it.",/review/rw5002480/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2018,Foutainoflife,7," Fan Film Worth Watching
",You have to give credit where credit is due. This fan film hits all the right points without being too cheesy or bad acting. It is about a guy who makes outdoor guide videos who just happens to stumble upon Camp Crystal Lake during a hike alone.,/review/rw5002480/?ref_=tt_urv

14 September 2019,saphira_dragon-80270,8," Lots of fun
",We loved it! We found it on YouTube and checked it out after reading some reviews. It was a lot of fun and even a few scares. Give it a try. We'll be watching out for more like this!,/review/rw5002480/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2019,jessemorrison99,8," A fan effort easily better than half of the films in the series.
",An interesting and very different take on the Jason mythos. A modern day hiker/youtuber treks alone into the Catskills Mountains with his hiking and camera gear. He stumbles upon an abandoned summer camp only to find that it is the infamous Camp Crystal Lake.,/review/rw5002480/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2018,michaelmcpants,8," Best Friday movie since Part 7
","I thought this movie was highly well made. Just from a film technicality side, it has a lot to offer. It has some very gorgeous shots. I thought that the color grading was very well done. Our main character's acting was on par or better than most large budget horror films today. The makeup and effects were all on point. All these components make this feel like so much more than a so-called fan-made film.",/review/rw5002480/?ref_=tt_urv

31 January 2023,paul_haakonsen,5," Well, it had potential...
","I had the opportunity to sit down and watch the 2017 fan-made ""Never Hike Alone"" movie again here in 2023, after having first seen it back in 2017. I had entirely forgotten about it, so of course I jumped at the chance to watch it again.",/review/rw5002480/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is actually a really fun way to spend an hour watching something. I gotta agree that this fan-film is the best Friday the 13th fan-film, the actor of Tommy Jarvis is back and he'll be back to get revenge on Jason in the upcoming sequels..",/review/rw5002480/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2018,awesomelookinggamers,5," Not amused
","I honestly don't see what people like so much about this movie. It wasn't scary, which usually should be the main premise of a horror movie. The build-up to the jumpscares were lousy and the acting was quite mediocre. All in all, not a great movie.",/review/rw5002480/?ref_=tt_urv
