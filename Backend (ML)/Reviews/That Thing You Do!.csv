3 November 2019,Tweetienator,7," I Want That House
","I like this one - of course the real star of The Haunting is the house and the interior - awesome, marvelous, top of the pop, whatever. The story itself of course is a well known one but the cast (Neeson, Zeta-Jones, Wilson, Lili Taylor ) works just solid to good with the story provided. All in all a nice haunted house movie that really lacks only here and there some (serious) gore and maybe one or two unique ideas to make it a more mature horror movie. My rate 6 + 1 bonus for the outstanding settings.",/review/rw0595939/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2018,EggOrChicken,8," Not a horror, but still interesting!
","If you wanted a horror story, they tricked you. Happy Halloween! But, it still has a good story line and it's visually interesting. Compare it to Thir13en Ghosts (2001).",/review/rw0595939/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2019,paul_haakonsen,6," A rather good haunted house movie...
","I have seen the 1999 movie ""The Haunting"" a couple of times now over the years since it was initially released. Well, this remake, I mean, not the original movie.",/review/rw0595939/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,1," Nothing could have saved The Haunting
","The Haunting, if you have seen the original, you know a great ghost story, it's perfection on film. It's a haunting tale of 4 people who go into a haunted house and with the simple trick of sound and movements, it terrified people. It still remains effective to this day if you appreciate film. So when The Haunting was remade in 1999, a lot of people pretty much had the same reaction ""WHAT? WHY? WHAT THE"" But in my opinion if a remake is respectful enough and just wants to reinvent the story for the newer generation, I'm pretty cool with it. This is definitely not the case, this is just a disrespectful boring shame that will waste your time and I guarantee will deliver no scares pfft! PG-13, what where they thinking? Not much apparently.",/review/rw0595939/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 1999,DocHobbs,4," Subtle chills....what's that???
","Well, my goodness, am I disappointed.  When I first heard news of a remake of Robert Wise's 1963 film, ""The Haunting"", I had a fear that it would be ruined by an abundance of summer-movie sized visual effects.  But, deep down, I had faith.  Surely, with such a talented cast intact...De Bont and company will not ruin a film, who's original was a fantastic and frightening movie that understood the delicate art of subtlety.  Well, subtlety, where are you now!!??  My fears have manifested...a promising movie has gone wrong. Yes, Eugenio Zannetti's production design is jaw-dropping; the movie is wonderfully photographed; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never EVER do wrong. But, the script puts it's fine actors to the test..asking them to deliver the kind of stilted dialogue that is only spoken in movies.  In the end, the always wonderful Lili Taylor is the only performer to escape with some dignity...and that's just barely. But, the crime of all crimes is that the horror is shown to us.  We can no longer use our imaginations, feel that horrible dread of fear of the unknown.  No, we get some visual effects to SHOW US what we're supposed to be afraid of...and you know what?  As wonderfully realized as they are...the visual effects come off as sort of silly.  And the climax is a phantasmogoric mess...but things had gone terribly wrong long before that.

1 June 2001,mrskywalker,10," More Like Hammer Films
",I know it is fashionable now to hate this movie.  I have seen hundreds of spook films including he original 1963 Haunting as well as most of the Hammer films.  This film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it. Yet many viewers can accept out of control films like Scream because knife killers are more easy to believe for most people than demons or ghosts.  Actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great.  I have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time. The director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the 6th sense.  The Haunting lets go and is certainly not boring.  Perhaps this film might appeal more to John Carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure.  The old Haunting was also a fine film from 1963.  It was even more scary.  See both and also The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin.,/review/rw0595939/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 1999,bat-5,7," Creepy, but could've been creepier.
","The Haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house, good effects work and sound work, a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house.  There are scenes that make you jump, and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past, I found interesting. There are genuinely creepy moments in the film and I liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you.  What I wish could've happened is for something a little more intense.  Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to contend with and I think that he held back a little too much.  Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago, and it still holds up.  The Haunting could've used a few more scenes of pure terror.   The ending was for me, a little anticlimactic.  Overall, I enjoyed it.  The acting is good and there are moments that make you jump.  I just wish it scared me more.",/review/rw0595939/?ref_=tt_urv

27 July 2005,poolandrews,5," Mildly entertaining big budget horror, nothing special but not too bad either.
","The Haunting starts with Eleanor Vance, Nell for short, receiving a phone call telling her to take a look at an advert in a paper. An advert which is seeking people who suffer from sleeping disorders to take part in some research conducted by Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson) as well as paying $900 a week she gets a roof over her head for free. Since Nell has just been chucked out of her flat & has no money this doesn't sound such a bad idea & gives Marrow a call. Nell is instructed to go to a huge Gothic cross between a castle & stately home 'Hill House' which in reality is called Harlaxton Manor & is located in England, once there she meets up with another test subject named Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones), they talk about Theo's fetching thigh high boots for a bit & explore the House & eventually stumble upon the third & final volunteer, Luke Sanderson (Owen Wilson). Then as if by magic Dr. Marrow himself makes an appearance along with a couple of assistants, Mary Lambetta (Alix Koromzay) & Todd Hackett (Todd Field). That night Mary suffers an accident & is taken to the hospital by Todd & strange things begin to happen, banging at doors, whispering noises & an overall feeling of unease. The house seems to be effecting Nell more than anyone else, it seems to be trying to tell her something, something about it's dark past that Nell can perhaps put right but there are evil forces at work that don't like house-guests...",/review/rw0595939/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2020,killercharm,6," I love this remake
","Critics' pans aside I love this remake. It has its own flavor of this story. This is a much more visual version than the original. The cherubs on the wall are so emotive, they actually scared me for a sec. This is the second version of Shirley Jackson's fab story about an anthropologist trying to prove the afterlife in a notorious old mansion. In order to do so he invites certain types to spend the night. High-jinks ensue.",/review/rw0595939/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2007,walken_on_sunshine,1," Hauntingly Bad
","The Haunting is yet another bad horror remake with phony overdone special effects and a big cast of on screen favorites and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever except maybe for the cinematography.Yes remakes aren't all bad but remakes directed by Jion Da Bont definitely are.I suppose that the A-List actors (Liam Neeson,Catherine Zeta Jones,Owen Wilson)are there to distract us from the boring plot,ridiculous special effects, and terrible attempts at scaring it's audience however this is a movie not a tabloid magazine we don't care whose in it we care about the characters and story two things this film missed.The storyline is like taking the classic novel The Haunting Of Hill House and ripping out four chapters and then using whatever's left for the film it is so boring and a lot of it is unexplained.The characters are pretty thin and while the acting is good you don't really care about any of the characters at all.Lily Taylor gives a horrendous performance and sounds like she's 8 years old when delivering her lines not to mention what a horrible screamer she is.Lily Taylor isn't made for the horror genre at all.The ghosts are stupid and cheesy, they look like a bunch of Casper The Friendly Ghost's and the ghost of Hugh Cain looks like a fat guy dressed as the grim reaper for Halloween with a smoke machine.There is this creature on the roof of one of the rooms that is a giant purple mouth and it's not even funny unintentionally just plain sad.The house is pretty and well designed that is probably the only positive thing about this movie it looks nice but that doesn't save it from it's brutal everything else.I can honestly say i felt like i was wasting my time watching The Haunting on TV for no price so I would've been even more pi$$ed if I had paid to see it but luckily it was on Scream Channel.Overall The Haunting is a boring remake that tries to overwhelm you with bad special effects, a poor attempt at horror.",/review/rw0595939/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2018,BandSAboutMovies,3," A poor remake
","This version of The Haunting of Hill House went through several ideations and creative hands, starting with Wes Craven, who ultimately decided to make Scream instead. Steven Spielberg, this film's executive producer, had talked to Stephen King that 1963's The Haunting was a great starting point and that the Winchester Mystery House would be a great setting. However, the two had creative differences, with King ultimately leaving and creating Rose Red, his take on the story.",/review/rw0595939/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2002,Prof_Lostiswitz,1," ""It should be burned to the ground, and the ground sown with salt""
","This movie is the most accurate measurement of how low the art of cinematography has fallen. $80 million it cost, and it was finished just in time to qualify as ""turkey of the century"". The reason it is so glaringly awful is that it has to bear comparison with the 1963 original...a real classic. The main effect of this [1999] movie will be to provoke more people to become acquainted with The Haunting[1963], and to discover its austere beauty. And that of many other forgotten old films.",/review/rw0595939/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2000,JThomas-2,," A REAL Stinker!!
",This movie is a remake of a truly horrifying and nightmare inducing 1963 film of the same name.  Why Hollywood thinks that digital effects and campy acting is better than the imagination is beyond me.  This film is so full of digital effects (none of which look real) and overacting that it cannot compare to the original film which starred Julie Harris and Claire Bloom. This film is just plain stupid.  The original (in black and white) is still the scariest film I've ever seen (and I've seen them all).  The original makes you use your imagination to fear the unseen - this remake doesn't allow you to do that and that is its biggest mistake.,/review/rw0595939/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2000,Xophianic,7," Spooky, but not especially scary
","Being a fan of pretty much all four of the main actors in this movie (some more than others) I was looking forward to seeing THE HAUNTING. After seeing the very cool-looking graphics that were on the commercials, I was even more excited. Unfortunately, I found that I had already seen most of the best-looking graphics on the commercials. I didn't find the movie too scary, but it was spooky at some parts.",/review/rw0595939/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2018,paulclaassen,4," Weird but quite wonderful, actually.
","Firstly, the house is incredible! The setting in the huge old house in itself is creepy, let alone all the wooden carvings of kids! The house's back story was actually more interesting than the plot itself, which I didn't find convincing enough. I did enjoy the eerie atmosphere and subtle, real scares without the help of overbearing music. The visual effects are simply awesome! The film does become weird towards the end, but nevertheless remains interesting and entertaining.",/review/rw0595939/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2000,Jexxon,," A truly horrible film
","One would like movies like these to be scary, or at least chilling, but de Bont's Haunting is just plain stupid. The house and settings are great to look at but most of the effort on making the film has gone into over-the-top computer generated effects and zombie looking actors, while the script makes no sense at all. How much fun is it to watch Lili Taylor walking around talking to herself in order to help the audience understand what is happening on screen? Unintentionally funny moments include Mr Crain's incredibly bad make up and Owen Wilson not being able to climb over a closed gate. In short, stay away from Hill House.",/review/rw0595939/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2014,cubsckc,7," Worth a Watch
","As a horror film, I think its a descent watch compared to many out there. Its a good watch to have one night for sure. Its different from most horror films because it basically deals with spirits and a haunted house. I would say this haunted house really did have a good way to grab the attention of the fans. So as far as directing the house to appear as an identity, I would say it goes as far as hitting farther than Amityville Horror. You could definitely feel the house. I was actually surprised to see the rating of the film. First of all, there isn't anything in this film that makes it BAD. To rate it a one, shows how terrible a lot of IMDb users are, who simply don't like something and put ones. I hardly ever give out a ten or a one because its an obvious ridiculousness.

10 May 2001,Sylvester,1," Poor remake of a classic chiller.
","This poor remake of the 1963 classic starts reasonably well, then replaces suspense with muddled and pointless special effects.  For example, in the original, one of the most chilling moments occurs when Nell and Theo are lying side by side in twin beds, listening in terror to the noises outside their room.  Nell tells Theo to let go of her hand because she is hurting her.  Nell then looks across at Theo, who is several feet away and realises that it was not Theo holding her hand. In the latest version, Nell is lying alone in bed, when suddenly she dives out and slides across the floor.  It is only when she tells the unseen force to stop pulling her that we realise what has happened.  And can anybody explain what Nell's final words mean - ""It's about family.  It's always been about family""?",/review/rw0595939/?ref_=tt_urv
