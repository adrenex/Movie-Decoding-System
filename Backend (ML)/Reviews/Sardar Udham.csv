21 April 2016,Oberrated,5," A lot of star power with no power
","I am at a split when it comes to 'Triple 9'. On one end, there were few moments where I did enjoy the film. The actors are powerhouses and did what they could with the material given to them. Some plot points were interesting to me and had my attention and lastly, I am sure there is a certain symbolism behind the constant use of the color red that is shown in a high majority of scenes. On the other end, however, there was way too much I did not enjoy. From start to finish, I hardly understood any of the characters connections to anyone. They are explained in as little detail as possible. It just was not my cup of tea as far as understanding who the characters were and what was their purpose. Kate Winslet was absolutely atrocious to me. From her seemingly forced role to her forgetful ""Russian accent"" as she seemed to forget she was Russian at times speaking perfect English and bouncing back to an ""accent"". The fan- favorite star power of Norman Reedus, Aaron Paul, Chiwetel Ejiofor and company was no where near enough to save this movie and draw enough of a crowd to make this movie even mistakenly good. Too many negatives and not enough positives. This movie is forgetful to me and nothing special. A few moments do not make up for a near two hours of confusion and plot holes.",/review/rw3432601/?ref_=tt_urv

",If you are planning to watch this flick be advised to watch it without being interrupted then you will enjoy this dark thriller. It all starts rather easy with a heist at a bank but once they have to do another job things go wrong.,/review/rw3432601/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2021,mgd_m,7," Good
","It's not a masterpiece, but it absolutely stands out in the landscape of the last few years productions. Triple 9 is gritty, hyperrealistic, dramatic, and cursed. No millennial fancies. Great acting, good direction. Solid. Surely worth a watch.",/review/rw3432601/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2016,sawaugh,6," This isn't a bad movie but it's not brilliant
","Triple 9 is a dark and gloomy story, which feels strongly inspired by Michael Mann's Heat. Unlike Heat, the film/script doesn't give the characters enough substance to make us care for their outcome in the film. The ordeals of the characters came and went without me feeling any real emotions towards any of them.",/review/rw3432601/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2016,Troy_Campbell,6," Not essential viewing.
","Since The Proposition was unleashed on audiences back in 2005, Aussie filmmaker John Hillcoat has made a name for himself as an uncompromising and ambitious auteur, bringing together A-list casts for bleak and uneasy thrillers. His latest Hollywood effort – following The Road and Lawless – dives into the grubby underground of Atlanta, where corrupt cops, ruthless bank robbers and Russian mobsters are often one and the same. A nice world this ain't. There's an unrelenting grimness to this noir-ish street saga that generates the desired mood, and the high level of dread permeating throughout proceedings maintains tension despite a predictably death-happy final act. Yet Hillcoat struggles to fully wrangle Matt Cook's twisty-turny screenplay; what could've been an intriguing web of lies, double-crosses and daring crimes becomes a less believable concoction of coincidences, plot contrivances and dubious character choices. Taking a leaflet out of Michael Mann's book of realistic action, the handful of set pieces are executed with flair, precision and unwavering violence, with an extended gun fight at the halfway point harking back to Mann's own Heat (albeit without topping it). Unfortunately the film is also let down by its vast array of players. Other than Casey Affleck's honest but worn-down cop, everyone else is evil and unpleasant to varying degrees – and rarely more than a caricature – making it hard to care about their fates. Hillcoat's menacing tone and visual ferocity ensure a certain level of interest and entertainment, but narrative and character weaknesses stop Triple 9 from being essential viewing.",/review/rw3432601/?ref_=tt_urv

25 April 2016,michaelseither,7," Thrilling Action / Short on cogent exposition
","Worth a look if you like urban action. There's a lot of action. The good guys and bad guys are really blurred but that's a modern flick for you. The police gang unit team line up to go after a gang member in group housing, up stairs and into the apartment was legendary. Great camera work. You felt like you were lined up with them. Worth the price of admission. After viewing, very few audience members would want to A: Become a police officer in Atlanta, B: Be tasked with arresting a gang member who knows you're coming. Adrenaline time. That's the good, along with plenty of recognizable actors doing representative jobs with what they have to work with. Now for the Not as Good: The plot is there but it is ephemeral. You can kind of follow it but the exposition makes you strain for it. I'd like to say that's on purpose to add an element of mystery but I'm not real sure that's so. Not a thinking person's movie. I've seen worse plots but the bones don't hold up the body to make it recognizable enough, at least for me. By the end you can figure it all out but it isn't built up a block at a time. I enjoyed it and gave it a 7 but it's about a 7.5. Maybe a triple 7?",/review/rw3432601/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2018,imseeg,9," Tough true to life dirty cop movie with original twists and magnificent acting. Not for the sensitive of heart and not suited for the masses, who long for a happy ending.
","BEWARE: NOT suited for the sensitive of heart, because there is some pretty gross violence in it. And definitely NOT suited for those who like to see a happy ending. NOT suited either for those who are sensitive to racial stigmas, a lot of reviews were mentioning this sensitivity.",/review/rw3432601/?ref_=tt_urv

","Triple 9, set in the gun-ridden streets of Atlanta, is surprisingly well executed and at times impressive to look at. But it does leave a rather unpleasant after-taste: like last year's Liam Neeson vehicle ""Run All Night"", virtually no one in the film has a redeeming feature which makes it difficult to empathise or root for anyone.",/review/rw3432601/?ref_=tt_urv

","went to this movie was excited by the trailer and boy was I wrong. the original story that the talented cast signed up for was awesome I assume something then happened as this movie was a jangled mess and almost was a bipolar experience. there was too many subplots too little time for talents like woody harrelson and kate winslett instead of a quality crime drama we were exposed to a plot that veered all over the place. the premise of crimes being done by cops was intriguing but junk like the subplot of the child , Russian mob was just way out there. just a waste of time and this movie could be a easy front runner for a raspberry award.",/review/rw3432601/?ref_=tt_urv

","It didn't take much convincing to get me into the cinema for this one. I've been looking forward to it for a while, not for it's content and concept, but purely for the names attached.

","I had to look up the writer. Turns out this is his first movie credit.I hope it is his last. Thrown together are a confused, convoluted mess of every thriller cliché and wild-ass idea without explanation for how and why they fit together. Russian Mafia using a Kosher food plant in Atlanta as a front. Orthodox Jewish men (really!) operating under the direction of non-orthodox Russian women who look like prostitutes (got to be an in-joke) and report to their Russian boss (who is in prison in Russia) via satellite phone. The Russians are working with Homeland Security and using a crew of corrupt cops (who are willing to kill one of their own for a payoff) as errand boys. Now: the plan, when the corrupt cops steal the MacGuffin and give it to the Russians, the Russians will give it to Homeland Security who've arranged to get the Russian crime boss released. Ultra violence ensues. Murky plot! Murky cinematography! Murky sound! Murky direction!",/review/rw3432601/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2016,cosmo_tiger,5," Even having watched it twice before writing this I have a hard time finding something good to say about it. Very disappointing.
","""We pray at the same alter."" In this town cops and criminals are the same people. When a gang is caught and blackmailed by the Russian mob they only have one option other then death. They are to break into a special forces safe house and steal classified government files. Without any real choice the crew realizes that the only way to pull this off is to set up a 999 call. When criminals, good cops, and bad cops all become involved something is bound to go wrong. I was actually looking forward to watching this. The cast is incredible, the idea sounded very interesting and I was hoping for a movie along the lines of Smoking Aces, but a little more serious. I wondered why it came and went in the theaters so fast but I was still excited. I watch and review every movie I order for the store and because of that 99% of the time I review my first impression of the movie. I did something I never do with this one. I watched it twice because I figured it couldn't have been as bad as my first impression was. After the second viewing I came to the conclusion that this was one of the most disappointing movies I have seen. I'm not sure how a movie with an idea this interesting and a cast this great can drop the ball so badly but they did. They movie was flat and uninteresting, hard to follow at times and just overall nothing I was hoping for. Overall, even having watched it twice before writing this I have a hard time finding something good to say about the movie. Very disappointing. I give this a C.",/review/rw3432601/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2016,musicfilm-2,4," Disappointing
","I went into this movie with high expectations, but alas, I was let down. Good actors and a plausible story, but inevitably Triple 9 fails to deliver. There are no characters I could really root for with the possible exception of Casey Affleck (just a little). I found myself yawning several times throughout - it just didn't hold my interest. No real back story so it's hard to fathom what these characters are really all about. Some sexy girls, guys with tattoos and attitude and bad cops. The bank robbery at the beginning was the most exciting part and it's downhill from there. Somehow I didn't buy Kate Winslet as a badass. The best line in the film was Woody Harrelson's reference to the Kosher Nostra - that actually got a few laughs. Don't say you weren't warned.",/review/rw3432601/?ref_=tt_urv

30 April 2016,KineticSeoul,5," Despite the casts, this is a very forgettable movie.
","I can't say this is a bad movie, it's actually quite watchable. But the flaw is that it's not a very enticing movie. The trailer is way more enticing and entertaining than the actual movie itself. I could tell they tried to go in a gritty and impactful movie, but compared to other street or cop dramas out there this one just doesn't stand out at all. Even TV shows have a more in-depth and disturbing parts compared to this movie. This movie has a great cast, especially for a street/cop thriller such as this. But it lacked the impact, momentum and gut churning moments that build tension to make it stand out. This is actually quite a forgettable movie. Most of the cast just seemed to have been wasted in this. None of them have any moments that actually makes them shine or stand out, because there is no memorable scenes. Maybe because I got a bit desensitized because I have seen a lot of thrillers that are better than this one. This is a movie that deals with crooked cops try to deal with idealistic cops with 2 heists thrown in. Overall, despite the good cast it's a very lacking thriller.",/review/rw3432601/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2016,paulmcuomo,5," I'm so sorry, but this film just dropped the damn ball!
","First things to say: the cast is really, REALLY good. Just the names alone can get me into a movie theatre, but they also hinder the movie in ways I'll soon discuss. I've seen one reviewer here compare the movie to Se7en, whereas I think its closer to movies like Before The Devil Knows You're Dead and Crash: both ensemble films that feature no concrete lead, and are bleak and very relentless in their bleakness. The plot of this movie is that a group of criminals consisting of corrupt security personal and cops are blackmailed by a Russian mob leader's wife into committing a crime to get him released from prison. In order to pull off said crime, the criminals decide to commit a 999 - the titular Triple 9 - and kill a police officer on the other side of town while they commit the robbery. The story then follows the officer in question, Chris Allen, the criminals led by Michael Belmont, and the detectives investigating the plot as led by Jeff Allen - Chris' uncle.",/review/rw3432601/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am truly disappointed with some of the other reviews since I sincerely read them all and respect what other's may say. However, this movie was so much better than I expected and I couldn't stop, pause or fast forward. I found all of the characters to be exceptional and important to the story line. I didn't think it would be as much as a nail biter as it turned out to be, but it is. I won't give anything away on this movie but it was well worth watching. I I hesitated for way too long before renting this movie. I found it to be highly entertaining with a view into a World that doesn't get all that much attention. I loved it! Don't read all of the reviews as though they were pure critiques. Watch it for yourself and don't miss anything.",/review/rw3432601/?ref_=tt_urv
