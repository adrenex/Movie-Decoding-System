26 October 2013,Sergeant_Tibbs,5," I guess at least it can still be the ultimate guerrilla film, just not the best.
","While this may not exactly be Heaven's Gate, Escape From Tomorrow is a case of the film's production being far more interesting than the film itself. Surreptitiously shot at Disneyland without any permission at all, this film can still earn its title of ultimate guerrilla film based on that fact alone. However, the most interesting factor is that not only do Disney now know about it, but they're not doing anything about it. Evidently it's not worth the effort but boy is is that a hook beyond the film's context itself. Everyone loved the idea of this film. It's a great juxtaposition, a surreal David Lynch/Terry Gilliam-esque nightmare in Disneyland. Unfortunately the films we concocted out of our imaginations are much better than the material Moore thought about. This is the work of an eager amateur.",/review/rw2885946/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2013,zetes,8," Imperfect and not for everyone, but I quite liked it
","The infamous film that was shot almost entirely at Disneyworld. The thought was, when it opened at Sundance in January, that Disney would sue it out of existence, that maybe you'd only ever be able to see it if it popped up online at some point. In the end, though, Disney just decided to ignore it (some have pointed out that the company's infamous litigiousness is more a thing of the past). So the next question has to be, does this actually work as a film, or is it just a curio? In my opinion, it very much is a curio, but not just because of the circumstances of its production. It is, in fact, an extremely weird film. It's far from perfect, but, really, it's so weirdly entertaining that I don't really care. The one thing I really love about it is the black and white cinematography - it's really gorgeous and eerie. The film has a hypnotic quality. It's well worth checking out.",/review/rw2885946/?ref_=tt_urv

","You ever wonder what it would be like if Terrence Malick vacationed in Walt Disney World, drank moonshine and had an acid flashback while on It's A Small World, and then immediately afterwards stared at Spaceship Earth while a bunch of kids ran by? That's pretty much this film. ",/review/rw2885946/?ref_=tt_urv

13 October 2013,Red_Identity,," Ambitious, but yet not enough
","After reading just a few quick things on this and how it was similar to both The Shining and Eraserhead (two of my favorite horror films ever), I was quite excited for this. It looked like an indie experimental horror film that I would love. Sadly, while I think there are some very interesting things in here, or things that could be interesting, it never really amounted to much. Not enough horror, not enough intrigue. I think the acting was solid and the story decent enough, I just wish it had gone to further places, done more stuff with the concept. It's not bad and it's sort of really memorable, but I can't really say I liked it overall. Really mixed on it.",/review/rw2885946/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2016,ironhorse_iv,5," It's time to escape reality. Escape from Tomorrow somewhat does that. Just not in a good way.
","Entirely film at the Disney World and Disneyland theme parks, without the approval, of Walt Disney Company. Escape from Tomorrow has been called 'the ultimate guerrilla film'. The reasons, why is because of the highly secretly production of monochrome black and white guerrilla-style shooting, in order to avoid lighting issues. Another, is how well, the filmmakers evade attracting attention of park security. Because of the ways, this movie was created. It allows the viewers to see the familiar sights of the Disney parks in a whole new light. Because of that, I really wanted to see this movie. After all, I wasn't sure, if this movie was even allow to be shown. However, I was deeply surprise later by the fact, that Disney didn't sued the movie, for copyrights claims. I guess, Disney thought it was better off, just to ignore it and not feed its trolls for the film negative depiction. Anyways, copyright issues wasn't going to stop me, from watching this fascinating film. However, after watching the film. I doesn't think this movie works at all. Not even in the realm of avant-garde art-house level. It wasn't sophisticated or high-brow. For the most part, it's stupid and gross out imagery was nearly unwatchable. It felt like somebody drug me, with a Mickie and I was going through a bad acid trip. Because of that, it took a lot of sheer will power, to get myself to finish watching this film. Another thing, that bug me about the film is how exposition impaired, this movie is. Normally, I would love to find hidden meaning within this story, but sadly, this movie takes the fun out of it. This movie from first time writer and director Randy Moore was also a bit too confusing for my taste. I really don't get this fantasy horror film, at all. The story about unemployed father, Jim White (Roy Abramsohn), whom sanity is challenge by the over-fantasy domain in which, his family wants to spent time in; just didn't work with me. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the film's story and imagery remind me of a mix between 1999's Sam Mendes's American Beauty & David Lynch 1977's Eraser Head with elements of Disney magic. It sounds interesting, but it's badly executed. Trust me! First off, the movie has horrible pacing. Lots of awkward long shots of nothing much going on. Half of the film is really, really boring. Then, there is problems with filming locations. Since, reshoots were nearly impossible. Some scenes were shot against a very obvious green screen background. Its looks so fake. You can really tell, which scenes were filmed in locations, and which were not. Another problem, is its CGI, which wasn't used right. However, the biggest jarring production issue that I have against the film is how content proprietary to Disney, such as the lyrics to ""It's a Small World"" and footage from Soarin', was removed from the film to avoid copyright infringement, yet others, are kept in. I guess, the filmmakers weren't as brave as they make themselves, out to be. Look, I'm willing to look pass the novelty, to see the truth about Disney, but the film wasn't presenting anything that seem real. Its 'so call' facts like the emu myth and Disney prostitutes, are just as fake as the castles in which, this story takes place at. I get that, this is a fantasy version of the real-life park, but if you going to make Disney seem like an evil company, you should show more realistic tones of that. Not only is the whole message of Disney being an evil company kinda unclear and too murky, but the idea of shaming 'escapism' is also a bit too bitter and joyless. I get that, the word 'escapism' often carries a negative connotation, suggesting that escapists are unhappy, with an inability or unwillingness to connect meaningfully with the realism world, but that idea is taken out of proper context by this first time director, Randy Moore. Not everybody that goes to Disneyland or go see a movie is depressed. Some of them, are just looking for fun and entertainment. However, you wouldn't know it, by looking at this film. All of the main characters, here are just miserable, hateful, and unlikeable. Don't get me wrong, all the actors in this film are fine, but being an escapism movie, doesn't mean, that all of the characters have to be jerks. It just means, that, characters have to be likable enough to connect with the audience. So that their spirits can be uplifting, when we see a character, be able to conquer the problems of his own world. Sadly, you don't see that in this film. Looking for a means of entertainment isn't supposed to be bad-thing, but this movie acts like it does. It's like, telling us, that we should be in shame for liking uplifting epic blockbuster movies and should act more realistic, gritty and downtrodden. I really have to disagree with that mindset. The reason, why, is because movies like this, is all about suffering. It's not a healthy escape for the viewer. If anything, this cruel and spiteful movie, can only make the viewer, colder about their own world. Unpleasant media make unpleasant people. I glad, there are film directors like director Preston Sturges that shows that. In his film, 1941's Sullivan's Travels, he points out, how 'vain and self-indulgent', films like Escape from Tomorrow are. Most people go to the movie for healthy distraction, not to be told, how depressing, their world is. Overall: I felt more disappointed by this weird film, than honestly downright hating it. For the most part, I was all eyes and ears for this surrealism film, coming in, but sadly, after finishing this movie. I can clearly say, it was a very below average film. I can't recommended watching at all, unless you want to be upset.",/review/rw2885946/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2013,matweed-844-558796,4," Great concept, lacks follow-through
","The idea of a man finding out he's been laid off or fired on the last day of his vacation, then suffering a mental breakdown has an interesting appeal. However, the plot was uneven (some mental breakdown, some interest in way-to-young women, some random interludes with older women). The guerrilla filming was great, but the story of mental breakdown could have (should have) been better, instead of being a random set of stories of a degenerate man who isn't faithful, and puts his needs above his family's. Based on descriptions, I expected a story about mental breakdown due to stress, but instead, it's more about the guerrilla filming style. He should have spent more time on the script.",/review/rw2885946/?ref_=tt_urv

3 October 2013,ValleyOfScarletFever,10," Absolutely Incredible
","My high review of this will likely make it stand out (and possibly not in the best way), but hear me out- this movie is the punk rock of cinema right now. It simply doesn't care. It's dark, twisted, hilarious, unnerving, and very Terry Gilliam. This isn't a movie to be looked in very deeply (as admittedly the symbolism is a bit confused and the plot takes a very strange turn), but it's fascinating, strange, and incredibly entertaining. It's certainly not a movie one will forget about quickly. It breaks the basic rules of film and never comes off as pretentious- it pokes fun at itself, and not in an annoying way. It's strange and fantastic. Recommended in general, but highly recommended to film buffs and fans of the bizarre. Definitely worth a watch.",/review/rw2885946/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2014,TheMarwood,4," It's a stunt more than a movie
","Secretly filmed inside the walls of Disney World and also Disney Land when the small crew was thrown out of Disney World, this would have made a killer short film. At 90 minutes it just can't sustain a feature running length. At 45 minutes, the novelty wore off and at 60 minutes my patience was wearing thin. There's only so many shots of Disney World I can endure with the anemic plot of a man loosing his mind there. The last 30 minutes are just abstract crap that is supposed to be blurred reality, but it looks they they put their footage in a blender instead of editing it. But it's fun to watch in the beginning as we watch our lead start to go bananas at the happiest place on earth and start lusting after two underage girls speaking French. If you are curious, there are worse ways to spend 90 minutes and you'll also have the luxury of the fast forward button.",/review/rw2885946/?ref_=tt_urv

","Just as a preface, I'm a huge fan of Disney World, I've gone there multiple times and I appreciate and love nearly everything about it. From the atmosphere, the technology, and just the overall experience, I find it to be a wonderful place. Anyways, for those who don't know, this was a movie entirely shot inDisney World/Land which that alone is absolutely mind blowing. The movie could have been complete crap and it still would have been interesting but it was still an actual decent movie regardless of plenty of muddled plot/symbolism stuff that doesn't entirely make sense.

15 August 2021,elicopperman,2," Failed Attempt at Conveying Any Message
","Back in 2013, there was minor growing talk of an independent horror film that was filmed in DisneyWorld without permission known as Escape from Tomorrow. Aside from getting some decent attraction at Sundance and even the internet, very little has really been said about the movie. So now that we've begun a brand new decade, it's time to look back on this feature and see how it ages today. After viewing it, I think I can understand why this movie has been forgotten by the public and even Disney themselves, because there isn't really much to say about it.

It's random... completely random imagination land? The storyline is non-existence and jumps all over the place. Father lost job and takes family on vacation to Disney, son hates his guts, his wife ignores his needs, so he goes chasing a couple of chicks. Kills a robot who tries to help him.

22 December 2015,sol-,7," Sometimes you just can't escape anxiety - not even at Disneyland
","Uncertain of why he was fired from work, a father-of-two does not heed the advice of his former boss and lets his imagination run wild while on vacation at Disneyland in this one-of-a-kind guerrilla movie. Shot on location at Disneyland and Disney World, apparently without permission, the movie is worth checking out simply for the unique spin that the filmmakers place on the popular amusement parks. Lusciously shot in black and white, the filmmakers emphasise every single shadow and manage to bring out something ominous in all of the buildings and rides. Clocking in at nearly 90 minutes though, the film feels incredibly long given the slimness of the premise. The story basically consists of the father slowly losing his mind, and while there is initially some doubt as to whether or not it is all in his head, this quickly disappears and things soon become fairly repetitive, some mood-destroying scatological humour near the end aside. Even if not entirely engaging the whole way through, 'Escape from Tomorrow' is an easy film to appreciate. The ""bad things happen everywhere"" agenda works well as the film focuses on the daughter tripping and falling and the son experiencing motion sickness, quite aside from the father losing his marbles. Roy Abramsohn also does well making his lecherous character come off as sympathetic. His job anxiety truly resonates and it is easy to feel for his desire to feel youthful again by following the two French teenagers around. What exactly his final appearance at the end is meant to signify though is anybody's guess.",/review/rw2885946/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2013,zack_wall,1," Like a B Movie Version of a David Lynch Film
","""What the actual f*ck did I just see?"" was the first thing that went through my mind upon finishing this film. Terrible acting, poor cgi, an unbelievable plot (I get it; it's supposed to be out there, but this was waaaaay too far out there), and WEIRD, WEIRD, WEIRD. It was like they'd studied David Lynch's material and then decided to make a B-movie homage. If anything at all, this should be straight-to-television, and not the pay-per-view kind either, but the SyFy channel at best. It's got a freaking awesome title that suggests the film is going to be equally fantastic, but my gosh, if it isn't the biggest letdown aside from various poor book-to-movie adaptations, or the Green Lantern, then I don't know what is. There is literally no amount of money that could make me watch this movie again. If seeing this movie is the difference between getting laid, then call me Steve Carrell, because I'm going to be keeping my v-card. That's my take on this movie.

4 November 2013,StevePulaski,9," A nightmare at the happiest place on Earth
","Escape from Tomorrow is a film I have immense amount of admiration for, and its filmmakers and devoted crew involved have all my respect. The film is one of the most deviant and memorable acts of guerrilla filmmaking in many years, and will be regarded in future years as one of the defining pieces of contemporary radical cinema. Cinema was furthered by people attempting to break the ""rules"" of the medium, and go beyond film conventions that were already in place. Filmmakers like Randy Moore will eventually define independent filmmaking through controversial filming tactics and carefully hidden camera equipment.

","Here's the thing. Yes this movie is getting a lot of press from filming in Disneyland without ""their"" consent, but it's still a good movie. It's an interesting journey of one mans perversions. Are they real? Are they in his head? The filmmaker explores these issues in a way that keeps your attention. My thoughts are- it could have been filmed in your local park. Where or how it was filmed, isn't the point. The story, direction, and actors is what makes it worth your while! The fact that a small independent film is getting a major theatrical release is important in the current state of the film business.

Even with its occasional flaws, Escape from Tomorrow is one of the better amateur films I have seen in recent years. It deserves praise.
