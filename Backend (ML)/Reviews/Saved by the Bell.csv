11 September 2009,planktonrules,7," Well, the animation was great...
","I was looking forward to seeing 9, as I had already seen the original short film (also called 9) and wanted to see what they could do by expanding upon the story. Well, after seeing this full-length film, I can certainly say I liked the computer generated animation....as for the story, well, it left a bit to be desired. And the problem is that I can't strongly recommend the film, but if you don't see it in the theater, then you'll probably like the film less because the graphics are THE film.",/review/rw2216668/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2009,kirk-246,9," A much darker ""Wall-e"", and that's a good thing.
","9 is a rag-doll who wakes up after a war between humans and machines that has devastated the world and wiped out humanity.He later meets a group of surviving rag-dolls and he tries to convince them to save 2.9 and 5 go to save 2, but they accidentally awaken a machine known as Brain.After they escape the dreaded machine, Brain hatches a scheme to build machines and hunt down the remaining rag-doll survivors.",/review/rw2216668/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2010,ccthemovieman-1,8," Not Super, But A Decent Film With Good Animation
","I don't know how much of a market there is for animated films like this but as someone who appreciates good artwork and computer animation, I enjoyed it. Yeah, the story is only so-so but the characters keep your attention - both good and bad guys, and it is deceptively involving.",/review/rw2216668/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2009,Quinoa1984,10," think if Don Bluth were forced to make a 'post-apocalypse' CGI movie... and it's *better*
","Shane Acker has a good career ahead of him. At the least, one can only hope so. His talents expressed here, his first feature adapted from his short film of the same title, are immense and sharp and clear and dark and staggering and other words I didn't have time to look up for this review. He takes a scenario one could be familiar with- entities battling robotic elements in a future or just another time period, a desolate wasteland, a possibility of hope on the horizon- but it's infused with the passion and archetypes of a fairy tale. And even with this there's certain twists, or unexpected pleasures. You'll see a lot of critics talk about the lack of a full story, of the beauty of the animation and look of the film outweighing any kind of story or clearly defined characters. You can take that to heart before seeing the film, but a lot of them may have missed Acker's intention here.",/review/rw2216668/?ref_=tt_urv

9 September 2009,SeanDTheFilmMaker,10," Absolutely refreshing
","Man I got to tell ya it is so nice to see something different that has the intensity of a mature movie yet lies within the realm of the animated world. Every scene was beautifully done and you can literally hang every frame up on a wall if you so choose to. The story was great, the suspense was amazing. Who ever complained about it not having a story, tell that to the crowd I saw jumping every so often from the intense confrontations. What I also liked about it was the hidden parts of the story. They give you enough information to enjoy the film but yet you can extract more of the back ground thought that went into what we saw in the completed film. For the first time ever I saw half of the audience stay behind after the credits role to not just see who worked on the movie but to debate back and forth about what they thought of it, what the characters represented, what happen in this or that scene, and of course the animation style and technique and how it moved them. Never seen anyone ever do that after watching a movie.",/review/rw2216668/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2009,ersinkdotcom,8," Pretty cool movie
","The first time I heard about 9 and found out that Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov were co-producing it, I was absolutely on board to see it. Anything that the guy who directed such quirky masterpieces as Beetlejuice, Batman, Mars Attacks!, Ed Wood, and Sleepy Hollow got behind had to be worthy of my time. And then you add the genius of Russian director Timur Bekmambetov to the mix and to me it was a no brainer. I was going to see this movie. Burton AND the guy that has brought us such visually complex and action-packed fare as Wanted, Night Watch, and Day Watch supporting a movie? It had to be good.",/review/rw2216668/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2010,tnt80808,7," A true great, if it had just chosen an audience!
","First things first. DO NOT SHOW THIS MOVIE TO VERY YOUNG CHILDREN!! This is a very dark and often scary animation. I would recommend it as an 8 years and up movie, minimum!",/review/rw2216668/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2009,juliet-staveley,9," A visual banquet
","As a long-time fan of animation, I like to believe (misguided or not) that I have high standards and am not easily impressed. But this creation blew me away, so much so that I felt compelled to write my first ever review on this site. Please forgive me for the abundance of clichés that may follow.",/review/rw2216668/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2010,ajs-10,7," Beautifully made but slightly flawed...
","Set in a post apocalyptic world where all life on Earth has been wiped out by machines, or rather one machine in particular. This film focuses on the efforts of a group of inventions, numbered 1 to 9, who try to redeem the scientist who made both them and the machine that destroyed the world. The machine has been dormant for many years, but one of its progeny, a mechanical cat-like creature protects its lair and takes anything that moves into it's area.",/review/rw2216668/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2009,jawbreaker18,10," Imagination at it's finest!
","I come from the school of early Tim Burton, and Jim Henson- two of my cinema deities from my earliest memories- and this is the first time in a long time that anyone has managed to touch on that magic for me. ",/review/rw2216668/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2016,captaindoctorghost,9," This film is one of few gems that explore the aspects of humanity
","This film at it's core explores the idea of humanity and what it means to be human. It does this by exploring themes such as friendship, curiosity and discovery, family and the fundamental question we all ask ""why am I here and what is my purpose?"" What makes the film so unique is that it projects these onto the main characters which are small ragdoll like automatons who have been set with the task of undoing the wrongdoings of their creator. This film has heart and on a first viewing the core themes and story may be lost by the stunning visuals of the characters and the environment they interact within. So I recommend at least watching this film twice to really appreciate all it has to offer. This film is set In a post apocalyptic setting yet it still manages to feel so unique. The closest I can think as far as cinematography is The Book of Eli, yet this is much more menacing and darker. Although wrapped up like a children's film with the animation, it definitely is for a more mature audience.",/review/rw2216668/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2009,claudio_carvalho,6," Pieces of a Soul
","After an apocalyptical war between human and machines, the world is completely destroyed and without human life. The burlap doll 9 awakes without voice and finds a weird object in the middle of the debris that he brings with him. While walking through the ruins, 9 is attacked by a machine called Beast but he is saved by another doll called 2 that fixes his voice. 2 brings 9 to meet his hidden community, leaded by the coward 1.

30 December 2009,jaybob,10," Finally, an Animated film made in the USA for ADULTS
","In 2006 a very promising writer,animator made a 10 minute short that was nominated for an Oscar. Noted film producer Tim Burton (among others) were so taken by by this artists 10 minute short. They decided to make a full length film. Pamela Pettler wrote the screenplay from Lee Ackers story.

15 May 2010,Wizard-8,," Animation for adults
","""9"" is an animated movie aimed at an adult audience. That's not to say it is filled with sex, nudity, and bad language - it has none of that stuff. Instead, it is an animated movie for adult minds - with stuff you don't see in a family animated movie. It is often downbeat in nature, it unfolds at a slower pace, there are deaths (at least I think they can be called deaths), and the colors are dark instead of being bright. So most (not all, but most) kids will probably be turned off by it. However, more mature children and their parents will enjoy it. The story slowly unfolds at a pace that will keep you curious as to what the explanations for things will turn out to be, each of the characters are unique instead of being all alike a la Ninja Turtles, and the animation is very good. There are a few plot holes that come up, mostly when the movie is over and you think about it, but the movie is still an enjoyable and unique experience.",/review/rw2216668/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2009,sketchball90,5," Once again, form over function
","I might have had my expectations too high when I walked into the theater. I hadn't done any reading and was under the impression that Tim Burton had directed it. So when it became obvious 5 minutes into the movie that once again I was going to be subjected to big budget stylistic environments and effects sans any kind of real mental engagement, I was pretty disappointed.",/review/rw2216668/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2009,anna_desu,9," Multiple viewings strongly suggested

21 January 2010,fwomp,10," Absolutely Hypnotic!
","There are so few times in life when a piece of entertainment can literally enrapture you that when one does come around, you wonder how you lived so long without seeing something like it. And this was my experience with 9, a single digit movie based on a single digit 11 minute short film of the same name, both directed by young genius Shane Acker.",/review/rw2216668/?ref_=tt_urv

9 September 2009,DICK STEEL,10," A Nutshell Review: 9
","Just like how Peter Jackson had produced Neil Blomkamp's first feature film District 9 and I loved that to bits, 9 has visionaries in Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov lend their producing creds in Shane Acker's animated science fiction film, and the result is nothing less than stunning, telling a crisp narrative with plenty of scrumptious apocalyptic styled visuals.",/review/rw2216668/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2010,Dr_Coulardeau,8," Death is life and madness is sanity
","The world has been destroyed by a war between men and machines, because a totalitarian regime imposed to a mad scientist to build the ultimate machine that could build more machines. The machines won of course. But on that last machine the mad scientist who was not completely mad built a plug-in that had to be brought and that plug-in is working two ways. It activates the machine if it is plugged into the machine or it is the destroying element if it is activated when off the machine. Then he creates some nice little mechanical humanoids whose mission it is to destroy the mechanical folly that destroyed the world. The last of these little technical androids is number Nine and he will succeed in his mission. The details are in the film itself. It is naïve, slightly frightening, definitely sickening about the silliness and gullibility of human beings. It is also full of hope that these little nice mechanical androids who are given the planet after this catastrophe will be better than human beings. Human beings had been created by God and these by a not so mad after all scientist. You can imagine the madness of God who created such an unmanageable species. Maybe not the best of Tim Burton's films but quite a good one, though obsessed as usual with death, which means with life.",/review/rw2216668/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2010,TheLittleSongbird,8," Interesting film with amazing visuals
","I found myself quite liking 9. It does drag in the second half and I wasn't taken with the ending, it could have done with more explanation. However, I liked 9 for its amazing visuals and well done atmosphere. The visuals really are the best asset with the backgrounds absolutely incredible. The music was fun and charming too, the script was good enough, the story was a good idea and nicely constructed in general and the characters are likable. Overall, I did like this movie, but it isn't a favourite of mine. It is one of Burton's(who has been hit and miss recently) better efforts this decade though, that's for sure. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2216668/?ref_=tt_urv

","From the ravaged wastelands of what was once civilization, comes small little creations made of fabrics and metals, a scientist's sole contribution to what was once mankind, stitched dolls equipped with ""pieces of his soul""(..they are him and he is them). On accident, ""The Great Machine"" will be reawakened by ""newborn"" 9(..the dolls all have numbers printed on their backs specifying the order they were created)who mistakingly places a circular object into a slot which restores it's power(..this is referred to as the ""source""). The Great Machine, invented by a brilliant scientist as a means to benefit mankind with prosperity, is mishandled by others(..military/government), corrupted and flawed, it was able to function on it's own, creating a robotic army capable of destroying human life. In other words, this giant benvolent machine contributed to the fall of the human race and is now brought back to life, with the ability to build a brand new army. So our little doll heroes must stop it and remove the source so that it will not threaten their world. Those caught by The Great Machine are ""zapped"", their ""life force"" removed and ""collected"" by it.",/review/rw2216668/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2010,michaelRokeefe,9," Humanity in salvage mode.
","Tim Burton teams with Timur Bekmambetov and Shane Acker to present an awesome surrealistic journey through a ravaged post-apocalyptic world. Supreme animation and steady paced story of a foresighted scientist, who makes it possible for nine of his rag doll creations to come alive in a parallel world to our own and band together in hopes of searching for survivors in a ravaged landscape. Each doll has individually unique skills that will be needed to lay the groundwork for a new and hopeful future.",/review/rw2216668/?ref_=tt_urv
