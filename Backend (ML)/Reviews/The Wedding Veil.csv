17 October 2018,Tail_End_Charlie,," Very Good Cast, and Intriguing Concept
","This show has been worthwhile... each episode has a unique plot, and the series is joined by a thread -- exploring the lives of people who are ancestors of the Romanoffs. The production design and song choice are quite effective in each episode.",/review/rw4393069/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2018,jaimemedina-36288,9," Beautiful
","Have no idea where it's going but the performances are strong, the tension is real, the story is captivating and the history is rich. All with stunning Paris as the backdrop. I'm hooked.",/review/rw4393069/?ref_=tt_urv

9 November 2018,jarez-13942,7," No Relevance to the Romanovs
","This series is a bit entertaining. The earliest episodes were good while the fourth was very lame and the fifth only a bit better. These stories could have been made without any links to the Russian imperial family as do not have any relevance at all. The acting is very good. I think the Romanovs reference was made as a selling point. Anyhow, this series is still interesting and hope the next episodes are of better quality.",/review/rw4393069/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2018,Newyorking,9," Unpredictable, strange, riveting show
",I chanced upon this show while looking for quality TV and it did not disappoint. I am sad that it only has one season. It features some of my favorite cast members. The series is about the current descendants of Romanoffs. Each episode has a new story and cast but there are subtle connections between the characters. The writing and acting keep you totally riveted. There is some suspense too. I loved every single episode and highly recommend this show for quality TV. My husband likes more action with sunshine and roses so didn't enjoy it as much but I was glued to my screen. Watch it!!,/review/rw4393069/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2018,mombirdogcat,8," Wow! - 3rd ep
",3rd Episode was very Twilight Zone-ish. Expected Rod Serling to appear or voiceover - until the stark reality of the ending. Totally surprised but made sense with what overpassionate obsessed people were trying to achieve without taking into account the psychological and physical cost. For me it was well done with great acting and storytelling. Kudos to Ms Hendricks for carrying the bulk and making us believe right alongside her.,/review/rw4393069/?ref_=tt_urv

22 October 2018,jakep3,7," It's Good But...
","Interesting anthology but it's so loosely based on the Romanovs as to make no difference to the plot. Not sure why they positioned the series this way, but it's really more of a distraction than anything.",/review/rw4393069/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2018,paul_bibby,9," A Fine Production
","This review is based on the 1st episode. I hope the rest of the series maintains the standard. That said, as the series is an anthology, each episode should be viewed individually.",/review/rw4393069/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2018,trace13est,10," Exactly what it's supposed to be: entertaining )))
","First, let's get the basics out of the way. Regarding the production values of this series (disclaimer, folks; I've only seen episode one, ""The Violet Hour""), everything is at a very high level, so your senses won't be disappointed. It is a feast for the eyes, particularly as Paris and the amazing apartment in which most of the story is set shine beautifully. The storyline is compelling, if a little unrealistic at times (the ease with which an apparently devout young Muslim woman finds herself having a one-night stand comes to mind...not to say it's impossible, just that it's a bit of a stretch). However, as with most films, too much reality would get in the way of being able to tell the story properly in the first place. Remember, this is a TV movie, not a documentary. We are supposed to be carried away; in that sense, I think this episode accomplishes its job admirably. The acting is first rate, making the characters believable and interesting (all the cast are wonderful, especially Marthe Keller as Anushka and In√®s Melab as Hajar). Despite what a few lemon-sucking nay-sayers write here, you won't be disappointed with The Romanoffs. It's definitely worth seeing.",/review/rw4393069/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2018,Odd_Adoxographer,5," Short comments on every stand-alone episode.
","First, you have to remember that the episodes and not connected and can be watched in any order. Second, the Romanoffs have nothing to do with the show, usually they're just the main character's ancestors, that's it. Third, these are mostly just 'slice of life' stories and, well, they're not all good.",/review/rw4393069/?ref_=tt_urv

14 October 2018,windsorenquirer,10," Just don't take it seriously
","In my opinion it is a comedy and I watch it as such. Very entertaining and funny. And of course it's not a documentary and it has nothing to do with the actual history facts and events.
The characters are fictional as are the stories. Pure entertainment.",/review/rw4393069/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2018,Boxer_007,9," Intriguing, Intelligent, Witty.
","Just finished all 8 episodes and must admit I was pleasantly surprised with the overall quality and depth of the series. I was entertained - The Romanoffs does a wonderful job of telling unique and captivating storylines throughout each episode. My personal favorite are the 1st, 7th and 8th.",/review/rw4393069/?ref_=tt_urv

19 October 2018,lorenrathert,9," The Romanovs - Alive and Well?

20 October 2018,JeanMarie2081,3," Missed Potential
","So far I have watched the first 2 episodes and attempted to watch the 3rd. The 1st episode has been the only one worth watching in my opinion, but I have to admit some bias as to why. I am a French-American, whose roots are in France. Therefore, I found the use of French and all the Parisian scenes in the 1st episode delightful. I also enjoyed Marthe Keller portrayal of Anushka. Anushka is a lovely, proud and strong woman and not just a spoiled, arrogant and aged aristocrat as one might assume if they fail to pay attention to key parts of the storyline as it plays out.",/review/rw4393069/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2018,bams007,4," PAINFUL.
","I'll do my best not to include any spoilers as everyone should have the opportunity to view and decide for themselves what they think of this series. First, I love quirky. Second, I love history. Third, I loved Mad Men like crazy. Fourth, OMG what an awesome cast! Here's the problem: The quirky isn't; it's just plain dumb. There's no other way to say it. It goes completely flat. Painfully so. History? You think you're gonna watch an actual cohesive story (and that never happens) that might at minimum tie into history, but from a character point of view, FEW if any in the three episodes I've watched, even acknowledge the context (leaving some things unsaid here so I don't add spoilers). While watching (in part because these are boring enough one's mind wanders), I find myself frequently distracted by the thought ""the guy who gave us Mad Men wrote this crap""? And the cast, some great people are in this and I can't figure out if they are doing a good job or a terrible job because it's all just so... painful to watch. It's just awful. I feel like I'm being extremely generous giving four stars, but I'm doing so with a tiny bit of hpoe in my heart that after watching the first three episodes, maybe something amazing will happen with future episodes that will actually earn those stars. This show at this point certainly can't earn more stars from this viewer (who RARELY writes reviews). I think I feel sad for it.",/review/rw4393069/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2018,ndrssegui,9," It's entertaining, has an estelar cast and outstanding acting.
","It's no mad men, but still, it's really entertaining and has an amazing cast and really good acting in it, the only flaw that I see is that it is quite predictable, but still, I'm loving it right now, though the stories don't really have a lot to do with the Romanovs, except that one of the characters in each episode is a ''descendant'' (in episode 2 they have that cruise, but it doesn't really add much to the story) of the Russian royal family. I definitely recommend it.",/review/rw4393069/?ref_=tt_urv

",I don't understand the extreme negative reaction to this show by some. I have been entertained so far. The episodes have no plot connections which really seems to bother some viewers. But not me.

","I would like to see how all of the characters are connected or what would happen when they all meet.
