20 January 2008,dbborroughs,6," Good action film
","The Big Screen version of the small screen cult favorite is a pretty good thriller. No, its not the best movie in the world but a good way to spend two hours. ",/review/rw0752962/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2004,grahamsj3,6," Underrated
","I haven't read the comments of others, so I'm not sure why it's rated so low. This is a pretty decent yarn with some good action and suspense in it. The story is almost believable. A drug dealer is detained by the Police and offers $100 million to anyone who can spring him. The offer is taken up by several people and the Los Angeles Police Department finds itself outgunned. Their only hope is the newly formed SWAT team, headed by Samuel L. Jackson. The whole SWAT thing is new and no one likes it. While, today, many people still don't like the idea of SWAT teams, they are now a part of the law enforcement landscape. It's too ""Military"" for most people. The film shows the build up and some of the training of the SWAT team, and their duel with the bad guys in the end. It kept my attention and I found it entertaining. And isn't that what the industry is all about? I gave it a 7.",/review/rw0752962/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2004,dromasca,7," Average good action film
","S.W.A.T. is a nothing more and nothing less than what you expect from it - god action film, the script is very predictable and full of clichees, but it has enough logic and good sense to avoid the ridicule. Acting is average good, effects are average good, and directing is average good - so what you get is an average good action film. Get your popcorn, biers as well if you are at home, sit back and relax. Nothing more, nor less 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.",/review/rw0752962/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2007,johnnyboyz,6," Good for what it is but some aspects are really let down by the fact it's aimed at twelve year olds.
","People may dismiss S.W.A.T. as one of those films that stands there on its own as pure entertainment for the average film going Joe and overall, they'd be right to do so. You don't need me or anyone else to tell you that this film is indeed a bit of light-hearted fun that most people can enjoy but what struck me was that more popular 'fun' films such as Snakes on a Plane and Pirates of the Caribbean didn't do as much for me as S.W.A.T. did and this makes me think that S.W.A.T. is a tad underrated, albeit as a popcorn fest.",/review/rw0752962/?ref_=tt_urv

","Thrown into a desk job when his partner Gamble disobeys orders and shoots a hostage, Jim Street bides his time waited beside being demeaned on a daily basis.  When the commissioner brings in old school SWAT leader hondo to put together a young outfit, Street is offered to chance to retrain with the select team and is soon back on duty.  Meanwhile a man is pulled over by a black and white for a broken rear light, but is found to be a drug baron. SWAT are sent to escort the man to a secure prison but, as they take him into a holding centre he announces that whoever breaks him out of jail will get $100 million dollars.  SWAT soon have much to content with and must ensure that Montel does not escape.",/review/rw0752962/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2004,rbverhoef,6," For action fans
","'S.W.A.T.' is a movie that does nothing more than deliver. It promises nice action scenes and gives us some. They look pretty good, so I guess in that way I can recommend the movie. The story is, of course, about S.W.A.T., a respected part of the LAPD. We follow a team with leader Hondo (Samuel L. Jackson), Jim Street (Colin Farrell), Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez), Deke (rapper LL Cool J), Boxer (Brian Van Holt) and T.J. (Josh Charles). They have to deal with a criminal named Alex Montel (Olivier Martinez) who offers 100 million dollars to the people who will help him escape from jail.",/review/rw0752962/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2003,WalterFrith,," 'Die Hard' continues to influence to this day...
","This movie is no doubt influenced by the 'Die Hard' series.  In this case, 1990's 'Die Hard 2' where the plot involved a drug dealer.  A drug dealer in this case offers 100 million dollars to anyone who can bust him out after he is captured.  Naturally, everyone with a greedy agenda, including some people that really make things sticky for the good guys, try to spring him. This film has a nice gradual build to its eventual payoff and Colin Farrell and Samuel L. Jackson are in good form.  I only wish that their characters had been a little better developed.  It's nice to see a movie where a character has a particular manner, saying or habit that makes their personality instantly recognizable.  This is one of the better films to be based on 70's television.  Certainly better than the 'Charlie's Angels' films (rubbish).",/review/rw0752962/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2003,thefan-2,7," Good action movie, but not enough Michelle Rodriguez.
","As cop movies go, this one isn't bad at all. It gives some nice background information about the characters without overdoing it, and the plot is satisfying if not awfully surprising. My main quibble is that hottie girl-jock Michelle Rodriguez didn't get enough screen time. It's nice to see she made the SWAT team, though, and we can always hope she'll have a bigger part in the sequels. On the other hand, Colin Farrel, who evidently has a modest following among female moviegoers, gets plenty of screen time. Something for everybody.",/review/rw0752962/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2003,george.schmidt,," One of the better tv-series-to-big-screen-adaptations
","S.W.A.T. (2003) *** Colin Farrell, Samuel L. Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Josh Charles, Jeremy Renner, Brian Van Holt, Olivier Martinez, Reg E. Cathey, Larry Poindexter, Ashley Scott, Denis Arndt, Reed Diamond, Lucinda Jenney. Better than anticipated big-screen adaptation of the 1970s cult classic police drama about the elite Special Weapons and Techniques division of the LAPD skillfully directed by tv veteran Clark Johnson (who cut his chops on 'Homicide: Life on The Street' and 'The Shield) with the focus on an oily French baddie (Martinez) making a routine prison transfer a dicey situation when he proclaims to give $100 M for his release from the cops custody ensuing all sorts of pitfalls and unexpected turns along the way. The screenplay by Ron Mita, Jim McClain and Davids Ayer and McKenna keep things lively but allow the action to occur gradually after each new member is incorporated into the fold, and (finally) Farrell proves his worth as a leading man in a big Hollywood film as the head-strong yet by-the-book disgraced member looking for redemption and Jackson as his no-nonsense leader of the pack. Expertly choreographed action sequences and some needed humor add to the mix of the been-there-done-that histrionics that naturally unfold",/review/rw0752962/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2021,kosmasp,7," Simple and fun
","I like the actors involved. I just recently discovered Reed Diamond too. You know one of those actors you recognize but are not sure where you've seen him and what he has done. Now he has just a small role here (which can be considered true about his The Shield stint, though that was a completely different ... kind of short), so this is more a personal thing - might still ring a bell with some here too though.",/review/rw0752962/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2019,Floated2,6," Run of the mil action film
","S.W.A.T is as one would expect giving the plot synopsis and overall theme. The film starts off with Jim Street (Colin Farrell) and his partner Gamble (Jeremy Renner) being part of SWAT and on a mission. Gamble ignores a direct order and a hostage is wounded. Gamble is fired from SWAT and Street is sent to cage duty. Six months later Lt. Dan ""Hondo"" Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson) starts to head SWAT. He puts Street back on along with a few others (the only standout is LL Cool J) and they go into training. Then a vicious French killer (Olivier Martinez) corrupts in L.A. and SWAT may have more than they can handle on their hands.",/review/rw0752962/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2004,Wizard-8,," A better title might be So-WAT?
","Though the trailers and commercials made it appear to be a hard-core action movie, the end result is anything but. Aside from the (expected) opening action sequence, the first half of the movie is pretty devoid of anything resembling action! It mainly consists of introducing the characters, bringing them together, getting them to work together blah blah blah. Now, that in itself isn't bad, but what makes it bad here is that EVERYTHING about this has a ring of ""I've seen this many times before!"" There's NOTHING about these characters or this material that seems fresh or even delivered with some liveliness. While it really can't be called downright terrible, it still has you muttering ""Yeah yeah, cut to the chase already.""",/review/rw0752962/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2003,cariart,," Swaggering Action Film Is Violent, but Fun!
","S.W.A.T. may be the best action film since THE TRANSPORTER...Just ignore the plot holes, leaps of logic, and occasional cold-bloodedness, and enjoy the fast-paced action and macho camaraderie!",/review/rw0752962/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2006,snow0r,5," A walking cliché?
","It's difficult to review action movies fairly. SWAT was never going to be a classic; this sort of this has been done to death, especially in recent years, and ultimately SWAT struggles to throw in anything new or inventive without looking contrived. See ""landing a plane on a bridge"" for details.",/review/rw0752962/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2007,markymark70,6," average... unrealistic...
","SWAT is an action movie with some reasonable action scenes and lot of posing and running around with huge machine guns. It is not a bad movie per se, but neither is it a good movie either. Farrell does well enough with his role as does Jackson but they both look like they are ""acting"" the part. I know that is what they are really doing but as an actor they have failed to instill the belief in the audience that they are in fact members of an elite SWAT team. It's not all their fault though as the writers and director don not give them much of a chance to really bring that belief across. ",/review/rw0752962/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2011,dbean66,10," Perfect popcorn movie
","I seriously had so much fun watching this. Is it clichéd yes? Is it stupid? No. First off, the performances are great. Sam Jackson is still a badass. Colin Farrel is very cool. LL Cool J does a decent job. Also Jeremy Renner was awesome.",/review/rw0752962/?ref_=tt_urv

","""S.W.A.T."" was a by the numbers TV cop show from the 70s.  It only lasted one season and its only claims to fame are that it had a young Robert Urich in its cast and had a really catchy theme song.

Jackson (as ""Hondo"" Harrelson)'s Los Angeles S.W.A.T. team; then, the try to escort handsome playboy Oliver Martinez (as Alex Montel) to a federal prison. This is a lot harder than it sounds, since Mr. Martinez has offered $100 million to anyone who can spring him. You can bet on Mr. Farrell's reprimanded former partner Jeremy Renner (as Brian Gamble) will want a piece of the action.

2 October 2005,The_Void,4," S.W.A.T. a load of rubbish
","You cant go into a film like S.W.A.T. with anything resembling high expectations; but you can go in expecting to be entertained - and this film doesn't even deliver on that implied promise. Sure, it has all the explosive action sequences you will have come to expect from this sort of tosh, but because the characters and script are so lame; it takes all the fun out of them. Roughly half of the dialogue in this flick is made up of smart-ass quips delivered in the typical 'cool' aggressive way, and it makes it very hard to take seriously down to the fact that people simply don't talk to each other like this in real life. I realise that this is 'just a film', but being unrealistic makes it hard to connect with. The story is typical of this sort of film, and it sees a rich jailbird offering loads of money to whoever can spring him from jail. It's lucky, then, that S.W.A.T. are on hand to save the day! (groan). The film handles it's plot badly, however, as it takes ages to get into it and most of the early stages of the film are taken up by boring training and recruitment scenes, which are filled out by more rubbish dialogue.",/review/rw0752962/?ref_=tt_urv

","I did not want to see this movie in the theater because most rehash movies from old tv shows suck. I was so wrong, SWAT was an over whelming surprise, full of action, male hormone and a tough as nails  Swat chick played by Michelle Rodriguez. Sam Jackson does his usual great performance, Colin Farrell is the hot shot swat cop who is turned on by his partner. LL Cool J is wasted as the cop that runs a lot. The ending scene could have better, it was the same fight at night most movies have to hide faces of the stuntmen. SWAT is great, lets hope for a Sequel. 7 out of 10",/review/rw0752962/?ref_=tt_urv
