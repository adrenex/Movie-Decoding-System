9 March 2016,Prismark10,3," Well padded
","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 is a film without any artistic integrity. It was purely made to grab as much cash from its audience as possible. You can sense this in the film which does not have much of a plot, scenes that are purely filler and the story just crawls because the book that it is based on has been split into two which means more padding than a model wearing a Wonderbra.",/review/rw3358106/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2015,dave-mcclain,9," Not quite a game-changer, but it will more than satisfy your hunger for the franchise's final film.
","It's tough to say goodbye, especially when doing so carries many different meanings at the same time – and has implications both on and off screen. ""The Hunger Games – Mockingjay, Part 2"" (PG-13, 2:17) is the final film from Suzanne Collins' blockbuster ""The Hunger Games"" YA book trilogy. So, we're saying goodbye (""possibly"" – more on that later) to this story and these characters in regards to our movie screens, and producers are saying goodbye to a film franchise that has become one of the top 20 in cinema history and whose films set box office records in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Within the action of this fourth film, the main characters have to say goodbye to others who survived the first three films, but don't make it through this one, while in real life, Movie Fans are saying final goodbyes to the late, great Philip Seymour Hoffman who died in early 2014 while filming this movie, making this his final film appearance. With so many real-life and character-related goodbyes involved with the ending of this series of movies, having a strong final film to enjoy would likely soften the blow. So, did we get it? Well The story quickly gets to the action and rarely lets up. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), the Hunger Games victor turned reluctant warrior has given way to a darker and more worldly (and world-weary) young woman who is anxious for an end to Panem's civil war – and obsessed with getting her revenge on the man whom she blames for it all – President Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland). As determined as she is to accomplish her goals, Katniss must contend with Alma Coin (Julianne Moore), the leader of the rebellion, who doesn't always have Katniss' best interests at heart, Katniss' love interest, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who has been brainwashed by Snow's henchmen to want to kill her, and her best friend, Gale (Liam Hemsworth), who's jealous of what Katniss and Peeta have or once had, or may have, or (If Katniss had Facebook, her relationship status would almost certainly be ""it's complicated"".) Katniss can be surly and isn't above going rogue, but she loves and feels deeply and has well-meaning supporters. Gale is there for her (as is Peeta, in his gradually increasing moments of clarity), and so is her sister Prim (Willow Shields), whom Katniss has always protected – at great personal risk (and whom Katniss could blame for the mess that has become her life, if you really think about it). Hunger Games mentor, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), friend and stylist, Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), fellow Hunger Games veterans, Johanna Mason (Jena Malone) and Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin), Alma Coin's assistant, Plutarch Havensby (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and tough military commander, Boggs (Mahershala Ali), all try to help Katniss, but there's only so much that they can do. She has decided that she needs to kill President Snow – up close – regardless of whatever propaganda role she's being given or what potentially deadly obstacles (as in, sadistic booby traps) stand in her way. Ending the civil war is very personal to Katniss and she alone is uniquely able to do just that – if she can stay alive long enough.",/review/rw3358106/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2016,KineticSeoul,3," Mundane, tedious and pretentious conclusion
","I never got what all the hype was about starting from the first ""The Hunger Games"" movie. The whole experience felt hollow and lacked depth although it was trying very hard to have depth to it. Now some may say there is depth to this franchise, but I personally can't see it. The whole experience felt pretentious to me and it even tries to make fun of itself for it about 20 minutes in. Claiming the whole scenario to be a tacky romance drama, probably to beat some viewers to the punch for it. Sometimes it seemed like this movie was trying to pass itself as a covert fascist regime with a powerful message but fails at it. Because it's so difficult to take seriously because of how everything is set up. I personally didn't care or felt connected with any of the characters and felt more detached from them as the movie went on. Strange, but it happened because none of them was memorable. It was slightly sad they died fighting for independence but that was about it. Sure, ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" was pointless. So it's quite obvious their main objective was to cash in. Because this film really does drag on and on and on, it really does get tedious fairly quickly. Sure, the whole teen angst, teen romance where two guys are after one girl and rebelling against authority might come off cool to some youngsters. But this movie is just so darn bland and boring to sit through despite it having explosions and fighting. Watching this movie was like watching a melodramatic cesspool with annoying characters that act very pretentious to try to bring out emotions from the audiences. I really can't see any audience member genuinely getting emotional about this movie, maybe a sympathy pat but that is about it. I give this movie a 3/10 because I have seen worse.",/review/rw3358106/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2015,mistoppi,8," Amazing ending to The Hunger Games.
","I love The Hunger Games trilogy mostly because it is so dark and brutal, and even if Katniss does what she has to do, she still suffers from everything that has happened. In a badly written version of the novels Katniss would behave like nothing ever bothered her, which would make her just seem violent and rash. When we know everything has gotten to her, we know what she is sensitive, we know that everything has actually touched her. ",/review/rw3358106/?ref_=tt_urv

28 November 2015,lesleyharris30,7," Certainly has Many Great Moments, but an Overall Disappointing Finale,
","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part 2 is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's a reasonably pleasing finale to the four part series, all of the character archs are wrapped up quite nicely, and there's some good twists throughout, even one that had me jumping off my seat. The chemistry between all the main cast members is still evident and it's sad to think this is the last film where we'll see them portraying these characters. Admittedly, I expected better, the first part of Mockingjay is very slow paced, but I could forgive it because I was expecting this part to be an action packed, intense adventure, and it's a little underwhelming in the end, the story dosen't move around as quickly as it should, lingering on certain plot points for far too long, and our interest in Katniss's relationship between Gale and Peeta begins to ware thin. The best scenes in this movie are certainly Lawrence's confrontations with President Snow, played miraculously by Donald Sutherland, he's great in the other movies as well, but here he really gets to shine as the sinister, evil character he really is. My biggest problem is that they decided to break Mockingjay in to two parts in the first place, it may have worked out well for Harry Potter but that's because it felt like they genuinely wanted two movies to wrap up the story properly, here, however, it just feels like they did two movies to make more money, and because of that, instead of getting one outstanding finale to the series, we get two that are both disappointing sequels to their predecessors. It may be a bit underwhelming as a finale to the series, certainly not as good as Hunger Games or Catching Fire, but The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part 2 is still worth the watch because of its impressive special effects and terrific performances, and if you're a fan of the previous movies then I don't have to tell you to go see it, any fans of action should get a kick out of it.

9 May 2016,dfa120374,4," A Dull, Boring End To The Film Series
","Wow. I think this has got to be one of the most disappointing ending installments to a film series I've ever seen. The previous films build this installment up so much that you actually expect it to be the ultimate one of the 4-film series, with plenty of action, suspense, and drama, and given the way the previous films unfolded that expectation wouldn't be unwarranted. Unfortunately the exact opposite happened and instead of getting a really exciting & thrilling end film, we get a very slow, somewhat dull, melodramatic experience. I mean the first moment of any thrills is about 75 minutes in and yet only lasts for 10 minutes, and the thing is, those 10 minutes are the most exciting the film gets.",/review/rw3358106/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2017,The-Sarkologist,3," Finally, the pain is over
","Finally, I've got to the end of this series and I am going to be glad that there are no more movies to look forward to. Mind you, there is the Allegrant series, but then again I feel that I am at that stage where I am going to pretty much ignore the final one in the series because, well, there is nothing all that different between that one and this one. Okay, this one was a little darker than the Allegrant series, though the Maze Runner movies were, I have to admit, somewhat better. Anyway, I'm not so much talking about those movies, but this one, in particular why they decided to split the final book into two. Well, I guess because Twilight and Harry Potter did it, so they probably should as well. Also, I'm glad that somebody bought the Hunger Games box set at the church fate because after watching these movies I would be regretting spending the money on it.",/review/rw3358106/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2015,davispittman,10," My favorite installment of the entire series! Perfection!
","The final installment of the hunger games brings us an extremely satisfying, exciting, and thrilling finale to the series! The movie was action packed, intelligent, well made, very well acted and just had everything right! Jennifer Lawrence of course was incredible, so was josh hutcherson and Liam hemsworth. Julianne Moore gave a very powerful performance as well. And then there's good old Donald Southerland, who gave a very focused and poignant performance. I was so pleased with the outcome of this film! The corruption of president Coin, Katniss and Peeta ending up together! I do however wish that Finnick O'daire would have made it to see the free Panem. The visual effects are very well done here as well! I cannot think of a single flaw in the final installment of the hunger games, an overwhelmingly satisfying movie to watch!! 10/10.",/review/rw3358106/?ref_=tt_urv

25 November 2015,samgiannn,9," The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)
","The Hunger Games series has finally come to an end with the fourth and final film in the franchise and serves as a continuation of Mockingjay - Part 1. Part 2 makes up for Part 1's lack of action by being the darkest, most violent and grittiest Hunger Games film, even with the standards set by the previous films and succeeds in ending the saga in a suitably epic fashion. Mockingjay - Part 2 finds Katniss leading the rebels to the Capitol aiming to kill President Snow. The Gamemakers have rigged the entire city with lethal traps to make sport of their deaths, making it the most dangerous Hunger Games yet. If Part 1 was too slow or lacked adequate action, Part 2 is heart-pounding from beginning to end. The action scenes are more violent than anything seen in the series yet, making any deaths even more gut-wrenching. Fans of the series will find it hard to watch at times, and if you're like me, you'll be gripping your seat or hiding behind your shirt for a good portion of the film. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 ends one of the most exciting and relevant franchises today in a gripping, emotional and brutal way, and it might be the feel-bad movie of the year.",/review/rw3358106/?ref_=tt_urv

","Just watched this, the final installment of The Hunger Games movies based on the books of Suzanne Collins, with my movie theatre working-friend who had seen this before and liked it. I really liked it too with the action scenes, the characterizations, and the emotions involved the whole time especially Katniss' reaction near the end when she made an outburst at somebody because of a tragedy. Jennifer Lawrence really pulled her emotions here and kept you watching on screen the whole time. Of course, the rest of the cast also did fine like Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Julianne Moore, and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman.

28 August 2019,anthonyf94,6," A pale final. Because the entire saga is pale
","I'm not surprised by the anonymity of this movie, because the precedent were exactly at the same level. The problems of this saga are the same for all the chapters: if the universe described is interesting (especially for the cruel, but not so innovative, idea of death games), the way how the characters act in it is or plate and dishumanized, or with more pathos than the necessary, that makes the scenes overfull and annoying. Moreover, the revolution plot, argument of these final two movies, is followed without any kind of psychological insensitivity and the exchange of goods with bads and vice-versa is not deeply felt by the spectator. Like the previous chapters, this final Hunger Games, that resolve superficially (because superficially was characterized) the triangle of love in favour of Peeta, reveals that all the saga is just a sufficient action and dystopian movie, overrated, and obeys to a lot of commercial aims, like the same dystopian (banal) world, the female heroine and the division of the final episode in two parts (typical of the first half of 10s years, cfr.
