3 November 2020,robertemerald,10," Powerful journey
","Powder is a beautiful story and I liked where it was set, Wizard of Oz style, in the American farm heartlands, much as so much good sci fi has been. Must be some sort of affinity there. If Powder is an example it is well deserved. Forgive me if it is in Canada. Beside the point, Lance Herikson is a highly balanced character, well played. There are other mountainous good characters as well, all played well. Great effects, a surprise. Why am I only just hearing of this masterpiece! Important sci fi and an easy 10 from me.",/review/rw2253690/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2000,TxMike,," I really like this movie, it is ""pure energy.""
","Sean Patrick Flanery, better known as Indiana Jones in the several ""Young Indiana Jones"" films, plays ""Powder"", an albino whose mother was struck by lightning right before he was born.  Mom died, dad disowned him, and Powder grew up in the basement of his grandparents' home, learning everything into his teenage years just by reading books.  And he knew every book, down to being able to recite anything on any page!",/review/rw2253690/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2002,RIK-22,9," Simple story, but a powerful emotive film
","If someone explained the plot of Powder to me, I would assume it was some sappy, simple, over emotional clap trap, from someone like Spielberg.  Yet when I actually saw the film, I found it to be deep, intelligent and very moving.",/review/rw2253690/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2004,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," Depressing, but extremely powerful and moving
","Sean Patrick Flannery is an incredibly under rated actor after this remarkable performance he gave in ""Powder"", while the story is very dark and just not pleasant, he really gave it his all into this film and you can see how emotionally connected he is in it. We also have Mary Steinberg and Jeff Goldblum who give their all into their characters, I just think they were not that well developed enough. They could have had a little more.",/review/rw2253690/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2003,CitizenCaine,7," A Film Of Emotional Power, Beauty, And Humanity
","I have not seen any of Victor Salva's movies before until now. He is also the director of the recent horror film Jeepers Creepers. The actors are all quite good: Mary Steenburgen as the woman that tries to help, Lance Henriksen as the local sheriff, Jeff Goldblum as the science teacher, and especially Sean Patrick Flanery as Powder. The movie can be classified in a number of ways: uplifting drama, family picture, and horror. There are strong moments of absolute emotional power, beauty, and humanity as Powder tries to fit in amongst the local people, but ends up teaching them lessons about humanity instead. Powder's appearance seemed even Chaplin-like at times, emoting with the slightest variances in expressions like a mime. Like many uplifting family movies, Powder was hard to find. I had never heard of it before and wonder if it was ever in theaters even. I don't think the script was developed enough and it was a bit predictable at times. I would rate it a PG-13 movie because of the intensity in some scenes and innuendo in the bullying. Teenagers, who feel they don't fit in, will strongly identify with Powder and will probably love this movie. However, this is also a horror movie, but a different kind of horror movie. At first it seems to follow in Carrie's shoes, setting up a revenge plot. But the horror we see isn't a misfit student getting revenge in unspeakable ways on classmates. It's in the town's inability to treat Powder with humanity. *** of 4 stars.",/review/rw2253690/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2004,Bryce_Tech,10," A deeply moving story, thought provoking, and unforgettable.
","It is rare that I see a movie as unforgettable and unpredictable as Powder. I am not a man who is easily impressed with special affects, but in this movie the affects always served a purpose instead of covering up the fact that there was no purpose. In an age where movies have become multiple scenes of graphic violence and corny excuses for stories, Powder is refreshing, filled with the meaning of humanity, and moved me to tears throughout the entire film. With most films, I am able to predict exactly what will happen and when. With Powder I could never quite tell what was going to happen next, and the ending was something I would have never imagined would happen and could only be described as extraordinary. There are so many elements to this movie: The paranormal; the challenge to everything we think we know about science and the capabilities of the human mind; the human capacity for cruelty; love and forgiveness; and the hope that our own humanity will one day advance beyond our own technology. Most of all, the raw emotion of this great masterpiece reaches deep into the heart and leaves an impression that stays with you. This is one of those rare movies that you will never forget, a true classic that illustrates truths about humanity that have existed since the beginning of time.",/review/rw2253690/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2005,jaysaze,10," Some movies touch the audience; this one seizes the individual
","The movie 'Powder' is a return to innocence. It possesses a spiritual quality that opens the eyes to life. And it lends a soothing note to those questions for which their seems to be more questions and few answers. Sean Patrick Flannery's performance was so powerful that one could actually feel the unconditional love within the heart and soul of the character that he played. The concepts that were brought forward, the passion that came with every dramatic scene, and the sense of realism and truth made it one of the most thought provoking movies of all time. Powder was not based on a true story, but it is, I feel, everybody's true story in some way, and it is as powerful, passionate, and inspirational as any true story I have ever seen. Some viewers may wish to begrudge the apparent perfection portrayed by the lead character. However, his only perfection was the way he searched so deep, often at great personal expense, for the suppressed perfection in everyone, and the hidden perfection in everything. I was somewhat disappointed by how the family quality of the movie was spoiled by the use of language by the school bully. Still, a must see for anybody who enjoys a thought provoking film once in a while. Even if you're a person who would prefer to sit down with a good book, as am I, the movie 'Powder' is definitely worth your time. In conclusion: 'Powder' is one of my favourite movies of all time. Seconded, in my opinion, only to 'The Boondock Saints'; also starring Sean Patrick Flannery.",/review/rw2253690/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2004,thedork-2,7," I Appreciated This Film

2 November 2005,spookymarsh,10," The message is quite clear for all of us........
","A story that encapsulates where we as a race are heading for a very bad outcome indeed. As clearly stated in the film by Jeff Goldblum's character, "" when technology surpasses humanity"". We as a species are in severe danger and crisis over how we perceive what our lives are truly about. We are losing our humanity by advancements in our technology that serve only to relieve us of harnessing our one true purpose that makes us unique within our humanity........Choice. The film also shows that a pure and unique individual is not accepted within those who are already lost of their own humanity. I find myself relating to 'powder' in many ways, albeit minus his physical and other obvious electrical abilities. But I do understand his humanity and choice to make humane decisions that do affect all of us. And his feeling of isolation and not 'fitting in' to his fellow kind. Hopefully one day we can be at a point where our humanity will rise above our technological demands, otherwise we are on a roller-coaster ride to self destruction. Good film,good message.",/review/rw2253690/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2004,Midnight,10," A ""Best of All Times""
","I honestly can't understand why some people disliked, or even hated this movie. I absolutely adore this movie. I think the acting is great (but then I again, I happen to love both Jeff Goldbloom and Lance Henrickson), and I also feel that Sean Patrick Flanery put on an awesome performance. This movie resonates with anyone who was the underdog in school, as I, and many were when they were young. The story is touching, emotional, and liberating. I don't think I've ever watched this once without crying. Add to that the spectactular soundtrack (which some movie-watchers often overlook), and this movie is right up there on my own ""Best of All Times"" list. If you haven't seen this, I only ask that you ignore the negative comments until you've had the chance to watch it yourself and make up your own mind... you might be pleasantly surprised.",/review/rw2253690/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2001,moonspinner55,5," Frustratingly follows an acute by-the-numbers fashion
","Albino teenager--psychic, telekinetic, brilliant--is found orphaned in a rural home and is brought out into the cold cruel world for the first time. Writer-director Victor Salva follows every clich√© down the path to predictability; he effectively wrings emotion from tender scenes, though he lays the schoolyard bully stuff on mighty thick. Consequently, his terrific finale is nearly overshadowed by the heavy-handed treatment (with lots of nasties in the supporting line-up). Fine cast--including Sean Patrick Flanery, Mary Steenburgen, Jeff Goldblum, Lance Henriksen, Ray Wise and Susan Tyrrell--turn in solid performances. ** from ****",/review/rw2253690/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2018,classicsoncall,8," ""Have you ever listened to people from the inside?""
","Films like this always intrigue me. Released in 1995. the movie was in good company with a couple of pictures that came out the following year - ""Phenomenon"" and ""Michael"", both starring John Travolta. Of those two, ""Powder"" is more closely similar to ""Phenomenon"", in that both pictures feature a character who has developed super-human learning abilities and the power of telekinesis. Additionally, there's the fear of the unknown thrown into the mix, as those who come into proximity with Jeremy Reed (Sean Patrick Flanery) are quick to judgment and fall prey to deriding the young man for no other reason than that he's different. ""I'm not like other people"" Jeremy explains in a scene with Lindsey Kelloway (Missy Crider), which only reinforces for her the idea that she's not like other people as well, a statement that could be accepted by virtually anyone watching the story, each in their own way.",/review/rw2253690/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2000,adam-106,," Extraordinary
","Much was written at the time of it's release, mostly concerning the conviction of it's writer/director Victor Salva on a sexual molestation charge. All that aside ""Powder"" remains a extraodinary film worth a look. A young man is dicovered living in the basement of his recently deceased Grandmother. Obviously an albino he soons reveals a intellect and abilities unlike any human before him. Sean Patrick Flannery gives a great performance as the youth.Salva does a fine job of coveying his difficult entry into surroundings he's never expereinced. Others in the cast are very good as well including Mary Steenburgen as the head of the school he is sent to, Lance Henrickson as the local sherrif in a more sensitive role for him, And finally Jeff Goldblum as the science teacher who realizes what the young man is and the potential of mankind to evolve into a more humane species. I don't think many people gave this film a chance based on the bad press Salva received. It's certainly one of the best films i've seen in recent years.",/review/rw2253690/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2006,XkukolX,10," Amazing, true and bittersweet
","I love this movie. Beautiful, amazing, heartwarming. It just goes to prove, looks are worthless. I cry several times throughout this movie every time I watch it.Wonderful movie, period! (Not to mention he's physically attractive, but thats another story all together.) But man, I wish it were real! The most odd looking people are usually the most intelligent and kind. That proves correct in most cases. I feel his sadness watching him, and the beginning is heartbreaking. The other characters in the movie, I really dislike for their treatment of him. Ignorance is bliss, but harmful. But I don't see how these other people can rate it a 5. something! I can't comprehend that, there is nothing wrong with it!",/review/rw2253690/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie is a superb example of how humans can be real cruel with other people that are different, of any sort. If this story is seen only as a fantasy movie, then it is just entertaining and touching, but I think this movie should be a kind of fable or metaphor, and if we make a little effort we can learn to be good to any living creature on this earth, just dont forget that we all die, and that life is short to waste it in hurting others.",/review/rw2253690/?ref_=tt_urv

14 April 2000,daveyboy-7,," Brilliant.
","Many positive superlatives could not express the brilliance of this film. It astounds me that given the rather un-original state Hollywood has been in since 1980 (and continues to be in with the blatant and dull John Travolta rip-off of Phenomenon in 1996) that such a wonderful film was given the green light. It is always a rarity to see this type of masterpiece hit the screen... and a pleasure too. There was much controversy surrounding this film upon its initial release... mostly of the kind that had nothing to do with the actual movie. To that I can only say one thing... it takes more then one person to make a movie! Get over it. Besides the clever, thought provoking, tender, respectful and intelligent script penned by Victor Salva, he also does a top-notch job in the direction. I loved this movie, I own this movie and I whole-heartedly recommend it to everyone.",/review/rw2253690/?ref_=tt_urv

","Oh, the controversy surrounding this movie...
I went into Powder with an open mind and open heart. I know all about the past of the director and the vehement protests against everything he did. But I would be an absolute hypocrite if I were to defend his story-telling capabilities (as a fan of Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2) without having seen his other most infamous film.
To reiterate, I'm not saying what Victor did was acceptable in any way, shape or form. You can commit some horrible actions and still be a talented storyteller, that's just the way it goes. Preamble over.",/review/rw2253690/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have to thank my friend for recommending this movie. He had been hounding me to see this film from a month and I kept on sidetracking him like an idiot. Finally I broke down and borrowed his DVD and sat down to see it. This could have easily slipped into the super-hero genre, but thankfully the director, Victor Salva made it into an amazing view into the human psyche when it comes to a person who is not normal and what that abnormal person felt about the world he was living in.
