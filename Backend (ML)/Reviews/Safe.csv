13 September 2019,kjproulx,10," This Film Tore My Heart Out
","I've said this before, but I will also never be tired of saying it; A24 is easily the best studio out there today, in terms of releasing quality content. Their endless devotion to finding original and exciting projects has always been an admiration of mine. Each year, they seem to be building a bigger catalogue of movies. Waves is one of their latest films to be produced and will hit theatres this November. Here's why, even though it may be a tough pill to swallow at times, you should absolutely be seeking it out.",/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2020,Xstal,8," Powerfully Reflective & Thoughtful...
","This treasure of a film explores the emotions, circumstance and consequence after a moment of chaos, that moment when in an instant the world begins to crumble and the lives and directions of so many are instantly and irredeemably altered. An original story, beautifully shot, elegantly performed and imaginatively directed. Left me asking the question: are any of us as bad as our worst fifteen minutes?",/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2019,WriterDave,10," A Devastating Work of Art with Glimmers of Truth and Hope
","After my wife and I walked out of the movie theater, completely devastated (in the best possible ways) by what we had seen, there was a group of teenagers (the perfect audience for this film) buying tickets and I couldn't help but think about how lucky they were to be seeing Waves. It's the type of film that if one sees it in their youth, it could change how you view movies, art...life.",/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2020,Osibob,8," Waves of Emotions...Mostly Sad
","Upon finally completing this ordeal, I was literally depressed. I have so much to say about Waves, but can't seem to find the words. So, I'll just say it was spectacularly acted, written, and directed. Shults was clearly inspired by the style of Malick, whom he's worked with on a number of occasions, but unlike Malick, he knows how to make his art entertaining.
The only reason I gave this film a chance was that it had Lucas Hedges in it and he's yet to be in a bad picture, so I figured what the heck. Boy am I glad I gave it a shot, great film, better than I could've hoped for...highly recommended.",/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2020,SnoopyStyle,8," family study
",High school senior Tyler Williams is on top of the world. His family is supportive and well off. He has his friends and a beautiful girlfriend. He's a star wrestler at school. His father (Sterling K. Brown) pushes hard but he does it out of concern. A nagging injury turns out to be more. A series of self-inflicted problems and unforeseen difficulties come at him in waves.,/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2020,Bertaut,8," Bleak, but never despondent; audacious and confidant filmmaking
",Writer/director ,/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2020,Cineanalyst,6," Maundering Moods
","There's some exquisite lighting effects in ""Waves,"" from a crackling fire to police light bars and rainbows, which is complimented by occasionally kinetic montage and hand-held camera movement. Quite a few shots tracking behind figures' heads in this one. And all of the bobbing of the frame coalesces with the rhythm of the soundtrack. The narrative is something of a rigmarole, though. Following the oscillations of a suburban African-American family in crisis, from teenage son wrestler abusing painkillers for his injured shoulder while fighting with his girlfriend over pregnancy, to the daughter dating one of her brother's teammates, I guess, while the father and mother struggle with their relationship and business. The melodramatic climax actually occurs in the middle of the picture, and it's intense. Even the aspect ratio closes in from the usual rectangle to more of a square tending to frame the characters' faces.",/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2020,ronakkotian,9," Raw and poignant
","A24 is the best film company right now in my opinion. Whilst their films don't earn much money, the quality of them beats any big Hollywood film. Waves is an experience that not many people will witness but the people who did will find it insane.",/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2020,truemythmedia,10," Why Did This Movie Get So Little Love?
","Wow! I was not expecting to have to adjust my Top 10 picks for 2019 but I just might have to after finally seeing ""Waves,"" albeit a little later than I wanted. I just wasn't expecting to like it so much being the follow-up for Trey Edwards Shults' ""It Comes at Night"" which I did not enjoy.",/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2019,Red_Identity,," More than your average family drama. Cinematic, experimental, and most of all, deeply moving
","I'm in love with this film. I was highly anticipating it after the fantastic trailer, but even I was surprised by the film it turned out to be. Emotionally moving and devastating it surely was, but the technical filmmaking on display here continues to prove that Trey Edward Shults is a director to watch for. I'm also in love with his two prior outings (Krisha and It Comes at Night), but for me this may be his best yet. This could have been made in a more typical straightforward way and still been powerful because of the strong writing and acting at the core, and yet Shults wanted to do more than that. That may mean that he may frustrate viewers and may prove to make his film more divisive, but as far as I'm concerned, the experimental-like cinematography, score (as well as the existing musical pieces) and editing really make this become a near-masterful film. It all culminates to create the most emotionally taxing and moving film I've seen this year.",/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2020,westsideschl,6," Winning
","First, our father coaching his son in wrestling says the goal is to win. I disagree, the goal is to do your best. What the Greeks called Arêté (excellence).
Second, as to the hit. I thought the sentencing was way too harsh given it was his only incidence of that nature & that following the slap he had that momentary loss of control (anger). The supposed emphasis on compassion should have been shown in understanding this event.
Third, as to how the story was presented I thought the excessive use of music (32 songs) took away from the importance of the stories.",/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2019,Turfseer,5," Dynamic, kinetic look at domestic violence in the first half gives way to lugubrious meditation on loss in the second
","Trey Edward Shults' certainly has come a long way since Krisha, his low budget debut in which he conscripted family members to craft a well received but rather one note meditation on a family outsider. But here with Waves, his universe has expanded exponentially, to the point where he's now grappling with headier themes including domestic violence and the emotional after effects of loss.",/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2019,subxerogravity,7," Waves: that turned out to be a perfect titled
","So this is what Martian Scorsese's means about cinema.
This movie was an emotional thrill ride of ups and downs that really will effect you on a personal level.
Whenever I thought I knew where this movie was going it will take you to a new night of emotion before claiming you down.
I was passionate painful and always beautiful.
Excellent!",/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2019,richard-1967,8," Tense, extremely ambitious, not always successful, but a must-see
","31-year-old director Trey Edward Shults didn't decide to go modest with his third feature. Waves is a big, broad movie, about many relationships, many deep feelings, many social issues. It doesn't always succeed, but boy, it was worth the effort!",/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2019,ncrd,10," How does this have a 7.1?!?!?!?
","Just saw this movie at TIFF.... wow what a film. Incredibly unique, this is the next Moonlight without being anything like Moonlight at all. The whole cast is amazing and Trey Edward Shults puts it all together perfectly. Incredible score to boot. See you at the Oscars Waves.",/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2020,deloudelouvain,3," Is it possible to make it more boring? Rigged ratings by the way...
","7.8 is the score this stinker got when I watched it. Another perfect example of a movie with rigged ratings, from people that were asked to give it a high score, from friends of friends of somebody that worked on this movie, and apparently they have alot of friends. Don't get fooled by the positive reviews, they're all fake. There is so much negative things to write about this movie. It's too long (you could skip half of the movie and you still wouldn't have missed anything), it's way too slow (they for sure like to film endless boring scenes where nothing happens), the story is beyond boring, the acting is just okay (nothing special here). The writer/director Trey Edward Shults loves to play with dark scenes illuminated by blue, red or yellow ambient lights which at one point becomes boring to watch, he loves endless scenes of people looking at themselves in the mirror, and he loves really crappy music (is there anything worse than those lousy R'n'B tunes?). All those ingredients made this movie become a snoozefest, one of those movies where you check every fifteen minutes how much longer you have to endure this crap. Note to myself, never watch a movie again from Trey Edward Shults.",/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2020,moabitnik,5," Far from being an overlooked ""masterpiece""
","After an ADHS beginning, ""Waves"" actually and thankfully manages to settle down some, but unfortunately, that doesn't make the whole thing any better. It's just an overlong artsy-fartsy soap opera that doesn't tell us anything about its strictly one-dimensional characters and can't seem to decide what it's supposed to be about (forgiveness, family, racism, classism, capitalism?). A good-looking but deeply unsatisfying and unsophisticated film.",/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2021,Gordon-11,," Beautiful but depressing
","The film is shot beautifully, with refreshing 360 degrees rotating shots. The story is depressing. However, I don't really connect with the characters or their hardships.",/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv

","And the moral of the story is: Parents - talk to your kids. Like, actually talk to them. Maybe give them a hug every now and again... I mean, don't wait until the absolute worst thing can happen to your family. Do it a little *before* then, kay?",/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2020,ian-dodkins,8," Original, artistic but not artsy
","I love a good story, and to be honest this film has quite a simple, albeit interesting and emotional story. But this film isn't about just a simple sad story, it's about the emotional connection between the characters. The cinematography is astounding.. great colour, close ups and longish periods of seeing an extended reaction. Might sound completely dire, but actually the actors were up to the challenge and create unique and engaging characters who you genuinely feel for. And isn't a simple good/bad film or people. You can see flaws and loveable traits in them all. The way the director characterises adolescent love is intense, genuine and beautiful. It really is a work of art, not because it's strange (it isn't) but because it manages to capture emotions in such a realistic way that delve into your own heart, in a way that you couldn't even do yourself. I have not seen a film that was able to do what this film did. Despite not having a particularly engaging story, I was indulging in every second of this film, mesmorised.",/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv

","What a beautiful, devious,exhilerating and strange a drama this flick was. its a heartbreaking story of a familylife, a life that i have not been experiencing myself considering all the steph-roles and invoulantary homecoaching, both as it shows into the film , by father and son.",/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2019,ThomasDrufke,7," Unforgettable
","Waves is a film I don't plan to ever revisit, but I appreciate the heck out of it. Daring, disturbing, and consistently original, Waves will rip your heart out and put it back together within a few scenes. It may not completely work as a finished product, considering it feels like two distinct halves, but it's a film I won't soon forget. In fact, it is most definitely an unforgettable filmgoing experience. Much in the same way that last year's Hereditary was. It's been over a week and I'm still processing what I saw.",/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2019,irisvp,7," Strong start weakened by second half
","I found the first part of the movie really captivating, intense, credible and very well acted. When the focus switches to the second teen in the families the whole plot becomes very mellow (still very well acted though but diminishing the overall impact).",/review/rw5302151/?ref_=tt_urv
