4 August 2008,Smells_Like_Cheese,5," Sadly disappointing
","I do have a question, what ever happened to the slow walking lame Egyptian mummies? I mean, as silly as they are, they're still entertaining. Now we have The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, I loved The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, it was watchable, but this one was just an excuse to make some quick cash. I was actually looking forward to seeing this movie, I got the opportunity to see it today, I was excited, but unfortunately, we now have Chinese mummies that can do anything that will fit into the CGI budget. Another disappointment was the recasting of Evelyn, I know Rachel Weisz turned this script down, but she was seriously needed, Maria Bella, who is a decent actress, actually made Evie a very flat character and not as enjoyable. Then not only that, but we have Brendan and Maria who do look incredibly good for their age, they have a 20 year old son in the movie? This story was a waste of time and money.",/review/rw1922007/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," It's dreadful
","Nice idea for a story, but it didn't have a mummy in it. Rachel Weicz's replacement just isn't up to the task, the script is horrible, and the film just has nowhere near the good vibe as the original two films did.",/review/rw1922007/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2008,3xHCCH,5," Now, I Really Missed Rachel Weisz In This One!
","I really like the Mummy series for its epic action, sense of humor and great special effects. I was very excited when I started seeing teasers for this sequel to be shown in July, mostly because it was quite unexpected.",/review/rw1922007/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2010,TheLittleSongbird,3," The worst of the series, and a big disappointment
","I enjoyed the first two Mummy movies, they were pretty mindless but very likable. But this one was a big disappointment, and by far the worst of the series. Granted, the scenery and cinematography are very good, the music is good enough(no Jerry Goldsmith and Alan Silvestri though) and Jet Li does try hard in his role. But the direction is uninspired, the story is clichéd(as are the characters), the pacing is uneven, the CGI is superficial and distracting, the script is awful and with the exception of Li(the only actor who tries) the acting is dreadful. Maria Bello is alluring but forgets her acting skills, Brendan Fraser is disappointingly bland and John Hannah's Jonathan is rather tiresome. The comedy and adventure this time around seems rather tired too. Overall, a big disappointment. 3/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw1922007/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2008,Fever,4," Curse of the trilogy
","Like so many great movies that became dragged-out trilogies, the newest Mummy falls right in. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved the first movie. But like so many sequels, this story line becomes repetitive. The first rule of sequels is to keep the cast. Rachel and Brendan and an amazing chemistry, but Maria Bello was abysmal as the new Evelyn. Her fake British accent and melodramatic acting was inexcusable. The sets looked like they were built by 3rd graders, the effects were overwhelming, the scenes were disjointed and the cheesy one-liners got old fast. Sure, Brendan Fraser still looks hot in a tux, but he still looks 35 even though his son is in his young 20s. Overall, I was terribly disappointed. I wouldn't even bother seeing it in theaters...and please tell me this series is finally over.",/review/rw1922007/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2008,rbsjrx,7," Ignore the reviews, make up your own mind
","I almost didn't see this in the theater due to all the bad reviews. What changed my mind was Roger Ebert giving it a rare positive review. Since I agree with Ebert more than most critics, I decided to go see it.",/review/rw1922007/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2017,Tweekums,7," The O'Connells must stop an ancient Chinese mummy this time
","In ancient China the warlord Qin Shi Huang conquered the surrounding kingdoms, learnt magical powers and was declared emperor; that wasn't enough though he wanted immortality. To this end he summons Zi Yuan, a sorceress, who has the power to make him immortal. She casts a spell then he kills his friend and closest ally, who is also Zi Yuan's lover.

19 November 2008,darlybrito,6," Not as good as the previous two
","I was very excited about the movie. I thought the first two mummy films were great and entertaining. Before watching The Mummy 3, I thought it looked bigger and better than the previous two. After walking out of the theater, I completely change my opinion. I was disappointed with the story, acting, and action. Yes, the action.",/review/rw1922007/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2019,tabuno,8," Exciting and Creative Action Film with Flaws
","3 August 2008. While this third Mummy movie isn't a classic nor the greatest, the producer, director can be complimented for taking some big risks and introducing an improved action movie that pushes the envelope while allowing some significant flaws to creep in. This usually and mostly amazing, dazzling chase and action sequences has an edge, a bite that is noticeably different and captivating than most other action-thrillers. Unfortunately, the sometimes stereotypical and predicable as well as illogical sequences almost intrude to the point of irritation, but not quite. The rich and sometimes overdone humor works and is nicely balanced with some darker moments. Overall, this is enjoyable and compelling movie with some excellent new fireworks. As an aside, Mario Bello who is the new Evelyn O'Connell character starred along with William C. Macy in The Cooler (2003) whose main setting was the Shangri La Casino in Las Vegas in an interesting coincidence to the Mummy's storyline where Brendan Fraser and Mario Bello go in search of Shangri La and their sidekick, John Hannah, even goes so far as mentioning turning Shangri La into a casino. Eight out of Ten Stars.",/review/rw1922007/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2008,neil-476,8," Great fun

1 July 2008,kimgrear,2," This Mummy should have stayed in his crypt.
","I was able to catch this movie at a test screening in California while i was on vacation and its not much of a film. Its the same story as the previous ones and most of the stuff in the movie were taken from them as well. I love Brendan Fraser but he didn't look happy to be there and with how the story was set up, you can't blame him for looking miserable. He has no chemistry with Maria Bello, who was just awful (She's no Rachel Weisz, that's for damn sure.) and he has even less chemistry with his own son played by Luke Ford, who has the charisma and the charm of a brick, not to mention the fact that he looks just as old as both Fraser and Bello. Fraser has more chemistry with John Hannah, who is a welcome distraction from the lousiness of the film. The movie itself is just a flat headed mess of bad visual effects with no soul. Jet Li lacks the menacing presence of Arnold Vosloo from the previous films but that problem is more than less on the shoulders of the director, who was in my opinion more concern with the style of the film than any substance it could have had and because of that, Jet Li and most of the cast got the short end of the stick and it shows.",/review/rw1922007/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2008,albert-wayne,1," They should have left this Mummy in the sarcophagus
","This is probably one of the worst films I've seen in my life, and I don't tend to toss around accusations like that lightly, but this third installment of The Mummy series initiated back in 1999 deserves such dishonor, cause it's such a bad example of film making, it borders on offensive.",/review/rw1922007/?ref_=tt_urv

",Since we saw Mummy III and Hellboy II as a drive-in double bill we're doing sort of a twofer - reviewing both movies simultaneously and posting under both titles - because we discovered that we were actually watching the same movie twice. It was a fascinating way to see these films; giving us the opportunity to directly compare and contrast them and analyze why one succeeded and the other failed.,/review/rw1922007/?ref_=tt_urv

15 November 2011,Leofwine_draca,4," Such potential
","Hearing that the third in this kiddie-friendly family series was to involve an ancient Chinese mummy rather than the usual Egyptian Pharaoh, I decided to give it a chance. After all, I love China and both Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh, who star, are favourites of mine. Sadly, about halfway through the production I realised that the filmmakers were happy to carry on making the same kind of nonsense as in the first two movies. The Chinese setting doesn't even come into it, except for the presence of a few familiar Chinese actors (such as Anthony Wong).",/review/rw1922007/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2008,crazychap,6," Not the Best Mummy film, but still enjoyable nevertheless
","It has been a decade since the events of part II, and seven years since the release of that film. Imhotep and friends are now permanently embalmed, but a new kind of mummy is in its stead, not in Africa or the Middle East, but in China, the other ""EAST"". The year is 1947, and the O'Conells have retired from mummy adventures and wartime espionage. Evelyn has released two-best selling books based on her real-life adventures (named after the previous two movies), while Ricky O'Conell tries unsuccessfully to make a living out of fly-fishing. Alex (played by Australian actor Luke Ford) is now an adult and has dropped out of school to follow the footsteps of his parents by discovering the long-lost army of Han, the Dragon Emperor. With backing from his old professor, Roger Wilson, he achieves this goal, but suddenly receives an uninvited guest in the form of a mysterious woman named Lin (Isabella Leong). Meanwhile, the older O'Connells come out of retirement to send a diamond known as the Eye of Shangri-La back to China as a gesture to maintain solid British-Chinese relations. In Shanghai, they reunite with Jonathan, who owns Imhotep, a posh nightclub named after the antagonist of the previous two films. After arriving to the museum in which Alex has moved the Dragon Emperor to, Roger Wilson double-crosses them and, with the aid of General Yang and his second-in command Choi, they bring back to life the Dragon Emperor and a new Mummy returns to claim his share of glory in the modern world.",/review/rw1922007/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2015,bowmanblue,6," Better on a second viewing
","I'm writing this review after sitting through the third instalment of the popular 'Mummy' franchise. Basically, on my first viewing I didn't really like it. In fact... I couldn't really tell you anything that had happened up until I'd watched it through for the second time, so it was basically like watching it fresh. However, I am glad I gave it a second chance.",/review/rw1922007/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2008,helmutty,7," It is made just for entertainment only!
","When I was young, I remembered that I was scared watching the first and second movies. After some long years, the sequel is finally made. This time, it turns to be action-packed loaded with great CG effects. Its story is the weakest but who cares when watching action-packed movies with CG effects. Its actions and CG effects are the main appeal of the movie and do not expect more than those.",/review/rw1922007/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2020,classicsoncall,7," ""I guess mummies bring out the best in me.""
","Somehow I missed the first sequel which I might have to go back to see, but this is one that's certainly not necessary. Brendan Fraser looked like he could have taken a pass here, and I won't even mention the absence of Rachel Weisz, which somehow I just managed to do. The story is OK as a stand alone I guess, but by now we pretty much get the idea of corpses coming back to life and endangering the entire world. I did have to marvel at the Big Band sound at a Shanghai night club, you think that was historically accurate? There are some good action sequences in the picture, with the wagon chase through the streets of Shanghai of particular note. And while John Hannah provided a bit of comic relief to the story, it just didn't feel the same as the original. But boy oh boy, things seemed to go downhill during the second half, and I was struck repeatedly by the cliched dialog that made me cringe every time I heard some goofy line like Alex (Luke Ford) to his father Rick (Fraser) - ""When I saw you lying there, Dad, I... I've never been so scared in my life"". Special effects aside, this one ran pretty much by the numbers and ultimately comes across as less than memorable. Nice touch with the Yetis though.",/review/rw1922007/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2022,goshamorrell,10," The mummy should have stayed dead
","Rick O'Connell and his wife, Evelyn (Brendan Fraser and Maria Bello), are back, having come out of retirement to race to the aid of their adult son Alex (Luke Ford), who has inadvertently awakened the mummy of the Dragon Emperor (Jet Li). In a prologue, we learn he was cursed by the sorceress Zi Juan (Michelle Yeoh), who incurred his wrath by spurning his love, and later, we learn, bearing the daughter of General Ming (Russell Wong). Both daughter and mother are immortal. So is the emperor, although it is a mixed blessing when you are immortal but mummified inside a thick cocoon of terra cotta. Now the emperor has awakened and unleashes his army of 10,000 slumbering warriors to feed his ambition to conquer the world, which is going to take more than 10,000 spear carriers, but he's operating on B. C. time. To counter him, the sleeping slave skeletons are awakened by the sorceress and are sort of funny; one misplaces his head and screws it back on. The emperor is a shape-shifter, able to turn himself into a three-headed, fire-breathing dragon, which coils, twists, turns and somehow avoids scorching himself. He speaks in a low bass rumble, just like Imhotep, the mummy in the two earlier pictures. The battle between these two sides is won by the side with the fewest missing heads. The sacrifice of the sorceress in relinquishing not only her own immortality but that of her daughter permits love to bloom, although would you really want a bride who was 4,000 years old, even if she was going to die?",/review/rw1922007/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2008,jdesando,," At least Fraser is getting work . . .
","I am beginning to think that after the superior Indiana Jones & The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull this year, the summer fantasy-thriller genre ought to be mummified not to be reawakened for years. At least, that's how I feel about The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. As a knock off of the Jones adventure, it doesn't resurrect well.",/review/rw1922007/?ref_=tt_urv
