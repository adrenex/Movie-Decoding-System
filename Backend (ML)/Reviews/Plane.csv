22 November 2021,grahamf-55542,7," Gritty, but very watchable
","I warmed to this by about E3. It then held my attention until the end. There were plenty of flaws, but I could live with them. Although the story and some of the characters are a bit extreme, I liked the little touches of humour and the great tussle between Lennox and the evil Confectioner (who, for some reason, is not even credited in the cast list).",/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2021,k-kininmonth,10," Vintage Irvine Welsh!
",Some of the low scoring reviewers obviously have never seen or read Irvine Welsh's work! This is vintage Welsh not the next tv detective that's why his name is in the title.,/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2021,daviddunn-90653,10," Top Drama
","A really good production on all levels. Yes the story is harrowing, eye opening and extremely brutal at times but this is real life and nobody portrays this better than Irvine Welsh.",/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2021,Xavier_Stone,4," Long, drawn out scenes and lots of filler
",This could have been an engaging 3 part series if it was better written and edited. There just isn't much here. Several sub plots that add nothing to the main story and it just goes on and on. These so called detectives find the killer in the most easiest way possible it's hardly a cause to watch the series.,/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2021,irnbru-333,6," Gritty and dark detective thriller - has promise
","Nice to see Dougray Scott back on home turf as troubled, philosophising DI Ray Lennox. A girl is missing and the serial killer 'Mr Confectioner' is a prime suspect. It's adapted by Irvine Welsh from his 2008 novel and reset in Edinburgh instead of Miami.",/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2021,amyroberts-34269,10," A must watch
","I love my crime series . Its a must watched. Watched all 6 episodes in 2 nights! Couldn't stop watching. Great story, great actors. Hope to see a 2'nd series not going to give much away!! U solve it!! Lol.",/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2022,InnerWisdom1000,10," Simply Superb
",This was a top-drawer drama series. The script was outstanding but the acting in particular was simply class. Dougray Scott in particular was astonishing- in fact his performances were on par with the likes of Sean Bean and Stephen Graham. And that's saying something. Astonishing stuff. And all of this is interwoven with first class direction and production. I could not take my eyes off it from the first episode to the last.,/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2021,Avidviewer-02847,3," Great cast, terrible script.
","I watched the first episode, but that was all I could take. I watch a crime drama to watch detectives solve crimes, it I wanted to focus on their back story or family I'd watch a family drama. I really don't care what baggage detectives are carrying around, it should have nothing to do with the story.",/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2022,stockorchid,4," Tedious and boring
",I am a huge crime show fan. There is literally no detecting by this detective. No investigating other children who may have taken the same path to the school as the kidnapped girl. No wonder the killer eluded capture for 20 years. This cop is unfit for duty. What a waste of good talent. Ff is my friend.,/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2021,supermellowcali,3," As interesting as the title
","""Crime."" I guess if you like to see men get emotional about their childhood this one might interest you... but I had to FF a lot thru this one and, I admit, it went so slow it lost me. Nothing very creative. Just another slow crime (melo)drama.",/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2021,ollster-93927,3," Gave up after episode 3
","Started watching this as the trailer looked good. Episode one had some by now predictable references to toxic masculinity and feisty female cop but this is par for the course. By episode 3 the angst of the main character was getting boring. They introduced an obnoxious , racist political type who, surprise surprise supported the union of the UK so was clearly a baddie. The dialogue became increasingly silly. The scenes where the compulsory neanderthal white male cop lead the suspects solicitor through the building were ludicrous and Ken Stott's superintendent character had a bizarre meltdown.",/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2021,hibee30,7," Dougray Scott is brill
","First of all let me start by saying, all of you that are complaining that you can't understand my language (Scottish) you do know that the series comes with subtitles in many languages (maybe snowflake is in there, I don't know, anyhoo, dougray Scott, Ken stott and the others, (to many to type) did a great job bringing Irvine Welsh book to life, this was gritty, humorous, rude, everything you expect from Mr Welsh, if you want daytime cop shows stick to your marplss and poirots, if you want a tiny glimpse of what it's really like this show is a must, and if you enjoyed this, try watching guilt.",/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2021,amyroberts-34269,10," Berilliant!
","Can't believe some critics on here!! üôÑ. Loved it. And yes, understand there are a few openings to make series 2! I Blydi hope so!! üôè. Hope to see series 2 soon!!! Xx.",/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2021,ikanboy,8," Stays interesting until the last episode
","It's a well written, engrossing psychologically themed police procedural with off kilter characters, sociological comments. Doug Ray Scott does get tiresome as the boozing, drug taking, rageful cop, and loses all empathy as a character very quickly. It all builds up to the end, and that's where the author's self indulgence jumps the shark. John Simm's sudden voluntary appearance as the killer is so obviously a plot device for the author to ramble on about trauma and it's after affects.",/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2021,cadwallon1969,4," Really wanted to like this!
","Have been a fan of Irvine Welsh's stuff since Trainspotting, but this? There are so many other British crime dramas that do ""crime"" better than this.",/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2021,cwqfck,2," Seen it all before
","Disappointed. Not an original thought. Highly predictable. Ken Stott performance was worth watching. Drab, dull script, which wandered aimlessly. Lots of pointless filler scenes that did not add anything. 6 programmes could have been 2 programmes.",/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2022,owen-watts,7," Violence Comes from Shame
","The first ever Irvine Welsh TV project is this fascinatingly odd procedural crime thing centred around DCI Ray Lennox, a bruised and haunted character, portrayed with mesmeric volatility by Dougray Scott. The whole ensemble are largely fantastic (particularly the evergreen Ken Stott and Angela Griffin as Lennox's partner Trudi) but Crime knows this too and indulges in strange deviations and character tangents that go nowhere. It's an intensely watchable show partly because of this strange unpredictability, sometimes it follows police TV clich√©s to the letter, sometimes it wildly subverts them. It's as irrepressible and chaotic as its ragged protagonist, for better or worse.",/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2021,cscigu,4," Tiring, overwrought box-ticker
","Over-acting, over-emoting, overdone mess. Constant, up to the minute references to slights, social justices, gender, race, etc. Every possible avenue to lead the characters into some contemporary societal drivel gets lobbed in here.",/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2021,leftbanker-1,1," Couldn't Make it Through Two Episodes
","A not very interesting whodunit about a child murder, which is not my cup of tea to begin with. A detective who is half insane or whatever, and a female partner who can't really fill out a role. The only thing interesting about this to me was that it's set in Scotland and the accents are fun. Nothing else about this was fun.",/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2021,coolhenrik7,5," The worst in British drama, Dougie apart.
","Terrible dialogue, hammy acting, paper thin clich√©s characters and horrible tick box Pc agenda. Scotts watchable, as is the Edinburgh backdrop but embarrassing tv.",/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2022,sogoodlooking,1," Laughably awful
","Not a single interesting line or character in the first episode. Sexism and insult attacking men is acceptable, while pointing out a female colleague's significant deficiency is not only branded 'sexist,' but is apologized for. It was so badly done I was waiting for the sarcastic finish to the scene but, nope. They were actually serious.",/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2021,rosemaryandthyme,7," Same Old Same Old
","Aargh not again... moody detective with past issues; woke, vegan, feminist sidekick; misogynist white bull-in-china-shop fellow detective that gets slapped down by the feminist and so on. Nothing new here. The only good part is the beautiful Scottish scenery, everything has a blue hue setting the mood and is quite lovely. Pity about everything else.",/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2021,baka_land,3," Tries hard but fails
","Watched it because irvine welch, but this was dull and repetitive. There is nothing new, family drama filler and a dysfunctional cop. The protagonist was a bad choice, didn't fit the character, it felt like it was a complete miss because of his poor acting and a really bad script. I guess even irvine welsh is going for mainstream, unmemorable trash.",/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2021,alimackenzie1,4," Oh dear!
",Started off fine but completely lost the plot. Should have have ended after three episodes. A completely indulgent mess which would have been binned if Irvine Welsh hadn't been attached.,/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2022,johnbeatnik,8," Imperfectly brilliant
","If, like some of the reviewers here, you long for the halcyon days of Taggart and long for there to have been ""anuther murda"" then you may come away from this disappointed. If you've read Crime by Irvine Welsh, this is only very loosely based on the original novel. In fact there isn't much about it that's similar save for the protagonist and the subject matter. In true Welsh style there are lashings of booze, drugs, intrigue, violence and also big laughs. It gets dark towards the end and there are some genuinely affecting themes here - not fit the faint hearted or easily triggered. It's not perfect, some of the acting is pish and characters are not all wholly convincing but all in all well worth a watch for anyone. Dougray Scott is absolutely outstanding. Give it a go.",/review/rw8539679/?ref_=tt_urv
