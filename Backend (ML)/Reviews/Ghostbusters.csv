14 February 2022,Carycomic,9," A beautiful film that well deserves that Swiss award.
",I saw this as part of a two-movie matinee at a multiplex one town over. And I loved it!,/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2022,rannynm,6," Good Family Movie For Young Animal Lovers. Unique Storyline
","The Wolf and the Lion is a great family movie for young animal lovers. The sets and locations are very pretty, and the music is lovely. The storyline is unique, although sometimes predictable.",/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2022,yooper365,6," Family film for animal lovers.
","This is a family film for animal lovers who want nothing but good things to be shown on screen. The lovable pups playing together as they grow up and interacting with this young woman who also introduces them into classical music that she performs on the piano. It's all a wonderful setting on a small island property that she has inherited, enabling the unlikely coming together of these creatures and her desire to keep them safe and away from the grasp people wanting to exploit them. You must suspend all thoughts of time passage and quick changes in location and just allow all the heart-warming scenes to just wash over you.",/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2022,johnironbear,7," If you love animals you will love this film
","In spite of the critical reviews this film has a lot of heart, friendship and healing. The acting was less than stellar in some areas, but had the script been better the acting would have been as well. Graham Green as always played his part well, and he continues to be one of my favorite actors.",/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2022,ilovefoodcoma,6," Based on true story?
","At first I thought this is just a fiction movie? But at the end of the movie, it said the wolf & the lion are living in Canada? So this is based on true story! Amazing~",/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2022,cjonesas,8," [8.1] Of big importance in this crazy world
","A wonderful movie for the family and animal lovers alike. The cub and the pup growing up together, learning and appreciating each other, while under the protective care of the beautiful, gentle and not so nut case Alma who also introduced them to masterfully played classical piano were a treat to wash.",/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2022,HotDoggyBoomBooM,7," A decent movie for kids and family alike.
",Although it had some flaws it did good on wholesomeness of two friends a lion a wolf and a girl their bond and their love nothing more .,/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2022,A_Different_Drummer,5," 2-legged people (esp the writers) spoil would could have been a solid film
","Say what you will about the original (1950's) DIsney nature films, at least they had the sense to make it 100% about the animals. In this all-too-typical Canadian (gov subsidized) low-budget indie, the scenes with the animals are magical. However when the humans come into camera and we have to deal with the terrible scripting and acting, the movie goes to pot. One critical scene involves an ""accidental fall"" so poorly done even a 5th grader wouldn't buy it.",/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2022,jonahjc-32829,10," Nice Family Movie
","To bad some people feel the need to rate a movie according to their own personal agendas rather than the true quality of a film ( which is art) . Appreciate it for what it is, not everyone has the same beliefs. I gave it a 10 to offset what I feel are some misleading ratings. Would love to see more family movies like this...ppl need to get over themselves.",/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,Horst_In_Translation,6," Lion cubs falling from the skies
","""Le loup et le lion"" or ""The Wolf and the Lion"" is a co-production between France and Canada from 2021. I am not sure what the main language is here. The actors seem to be rather from the English-language parts of Canada, but it says French here on imdb or at least that both languages are included. I myself watched the German dub, which was not always a winner, like when it talked about chihuahuas from Beverly Hills, but this was maybe the same in the original. Anyway, I am jumping too quickly into the plot now, let's look at the basics first. The poster looks a bit staged here on imdb, but the animals you see in this movie are real and authentic and not animated as you could think from the photo that comes with this movie. The film stays slightly under the 100-minute mark, so not a particularly short or long movie we have here. The writer and director is Gilles de Maistre from France and this may explain why France is a production country here. It is not the first time he has made a film about a girl and a lion, even if the female in this film is a bit older than Mia. And this time it is the wolf that is white and not the lion. If you have seen the older film I am talking about, you can surely easily make the connection here. The two movies felt indeed very similar in terms of style and approach. Lead actress is Molly Kunz and she is pretty stunning to say the least. For the rest of the cast you can check out the list yourself with the exception of Graham Greene. He is an Oscar nominee, now pretty old and his by far most known film is Dances with Wolves, so definitely no coincidence that he is a part of this wolf-themed film here too. It also maybe does not say the very best about his career, but let's not be mean. He was okay here given the material he had to work with. The other actors I cannot say too much about because I simply don't know them. I see at least one of them is related to the filmmaker. Here and there, the smaller characters did feel a bit like caricatures honestly, especially when they aimed at comedy. But the writing there is at least as much to blame as the performers. Oh and I see de Maistre's next film is apparently about jaguars? Or at least it includes the word in the title, so maybe similar territory like this one.",/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2022,chinandchin,2," a movie for primary school students, they don't care about logic
","It could be a 5 stars( out of 10 ) film, but letting a university student to edit a movie is just unbelievable bold...... and won't work.",/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2022,GrammarMatters,3," Bad
","I'm skeptical of Canadian movies, but this one is 'extra' Canadian.",/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,tovelise,2," Wish Disney had made this
","Apparently the wolf-lion relationship is true in real life, and the scenes of the animals together are wonderful. The humans spoil this film. To be fair, the writing is abysmal, which is a challenge for any actor, but these actors are pretty horrible. The plot is absolutely ridiculous: a lion cub falls from a tree into a girl's arms? A veritable horde of heavily armed officers are on a shoot-to-kill crusade in a large, unpopulated forest? Really? Add in the circus guy who is the worst role model on earth for his son as he drugs, whips and terrorizes the animal and then carefully, repeatedly, teaches his son to lie. Not a film I would want any kids of mine to watch. Never mind that a mother dies within the opening moments of the movie; in all other respects this ain't Disney. Go watch Togo instead - a real story of a heroic animal told quite well.",/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2022,ron-97695,8," Nice pleasant movie
",Nice little story for a Saturday night. Wee bit hard to believe but def a feel good movie most of the time ðŸ˜¹. Certainly watchable with your children. Shame the last comment was in French.,/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2022,alexandermalic,1," Ugh!
",That's some really bad acting. Can't remember last time when I was turned off from the acting as I was in this movie. What I mean is the main actress. I'd like to understand how she got this gig?,/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2022,Draysan-Jennings,6," Easy watch
",I thought it was a simple uncomplicated film with an original storyline. Some people are saying it's a true story but I couldn't find anything on Google to back it up. Kinda hard to believe a lion cub could survive a plane crash but what do I know. I was going to give this film 5 stars if it ended with the lion getting killed. The little twist in the end definitely saved the movie for me. 6 stars.,/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2022,designandy,8," AMAZING - WOW!
","A true story considering what the film ends with of the text. A fantastic combination of joy, sorrow & love. Nature is beautiful. I might wish the movie would have been 20 mins longer & see more how each other is a little more with the animals and the other people.",/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2022,kanifuker-84708,1," Awful, slow and boring.
","This was Awful, slow and boring. The acting was horrendous from all the actors and the plot/storyline just stupid. It started off ok then just turned into a homeward bound with a lion and a wolf. Absolute garbage.",/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2022,Wordwhisperer,1," Useless movie
","Bad acting, bad script, bad directing, this was a huge waste of time to watch it. I see that this cannot be a blockbuster, but giving a lion to a circus in 21st century?? That was a bad joke.",/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2022,jbscbenson,8," For those who were underwhelmed
","I thought this was a pretty good movie. Read about the story or watch the trailer. You would know exactly what to expect! Sure it's not a blockbuster, but. I'm guessing it was a low budget film. I guess I have low expectations when it comes to movies. That was I hardly ever feel like I've wasted any money.",/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv

",Only thing I dt understand is where would a lion come from in the Canadian Forest. That makes no sense . But acting is good overall story well writing.,/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2022,vus29,4," Pretty actress
","The film is ridiculous. If it is based on a true story, then that is remarkable. Unnatural and unkind but still remarkable. The story itself was downright boring, particularly when Molly (lead actress) is talking to herself and the animals to verbalise her thoughts. I found myself watching it to the end though because Molly is so beautiful and captivating. My heart bleeds for those wild animals and all animals in captivity in zoos, animals sanctuaries and safaris. But by god, Molly is such a beautiful lady. I could watch her all day long!",/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2022,carlilynn,1," Where do I even begin...
","Terrible acting, terrible writing, terrible story, even if it is based on a true one. Made zero sense, awful situations, animal cruelty ALL around. I just cannot. It only gets one star thanks to Canada being impeccably beautiful.",/review/rw7860595/?ref_=tt_urv
