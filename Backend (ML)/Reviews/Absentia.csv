14 March 2018,jimbo-53-186511,3," Cranston is excellent, but the film itself was something of a missed opportunity
","Successful and wealthy litigator Howard Wakefield (Bryan Cranston) suffers a nervous breakdown and decides to hide out in the family attic for several months. During these months, Howard observes his family continuing their lives without him and as time passes by his behaviour becomes increasingly erratic and he often wonders whether he can return back to his old life (or indeed if he wants to)...",/review/rw5073590/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2017,barbagvido,6," Could have been more interesting
","Wakefield is a film starring Bryan Cranston as the man who hides in a garage for months looking at the events in his house and everyone thinking he's missing. Basically, he's looking at his life without him.",/review/rw5073590/?ref_=tt_urv

",What a let down in the writing department. Did the brain juices run dry in the last 5 minutes of this film?,/review/rw5073590/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2017,srdjan_veljkovic,5," Premise is interesting, as are some parts, but, the whole - not so much
","Even in the movie, the obvious is stated: who hasn't had a thought about leaving their life and watching how people from that life react to them being gone missing? This movie explores that scenario. It's somewhat original, so, it's interesting.",/review/rw5073590/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2020,havoke-74121,9," Its my kind of contemplating.
","You can talk about how misleading the narrator is, how slow paced it is, but for me it creates a meditative character study, that actually relishes how sincerely flawed our protagonist is.",/review/rw5073590/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2017,themovieparadise,9," Fascinatingly Introspective
","Let's start first with Bryan Cranston's performance. When watching this movie, I think it would be easy for someone to overlook just how good he is. 85% of the movie is Cranston sitting in a room talking to himself, and yet he is able to bring such dimension and drama to it. He makes it look so easy and natural, and that's why it would be easy to overlook his performance. He absolutely carries the film, and it does not work without his ability as an actor. Jennifer Garner is also really good in this movie, however she is absolutely outshined by how brilliant Cranston is. Her role was also minute enough that really anyone could have played her character, whereas I don't think just anyone could have played Howard Wakefield. What struck me most about Wakefield was how much of a character study it was. It was actually more of a situational study. What does an average human being reduce themselves to when stripped of all their possessions? When they become entirely deprogrammed from society? This idea has been explored before, in films like Cast Away, but never quite in this way...",/review/rw5073590/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2017,gallagherkellie,5," Entertaining but a little pointless
","Bryan Cranston did a great job as always, but the plot was a little drawn out. Interesting idea for a movie, there isn't much explanation as to why he hid away for so long and why no-one ever checked the attic, but quirky and funny at times. The ending was a little frustrating but overall a decent but not amazing movie.",/review/rw5073590/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2018,jasarrubbo,4," Utter disappointment

VERY difficult to watch, I at least wanted so see the families reaction, but NOTHING!",/review/rw5073590/?ref_=tt_urv

17 May 2017,ferguson-6,7," Here's looking at you (and me)
","Greetings again from the darkness. Oscar nominated for her screenplay to The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), Robin Swicord's directorial debut of The Jane Austen Book Club (2007) was not particularly impressive. However, she bounces back nicely with this Bryan Cranston vehicle and one of the more creative scripts featuring internal dialogue that's ever hit the silver screen. Cranston is showing a knack for selecting interesting projects, and he excels here as the high-powered attorney who spontaneously decides to drop out of society in a most unusual manner.",/review/rw5073590/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2017,NicolaTesla,4," Lost time
","This move got me intrigued for a while and I specifically waiting and avoided to read or see any reviews because I wanted to experience this movie from a blank slate. when we got the end credits of this movie I was left with a feeling of '2-hours lost i'm never getting back' What a waste of time and talent. I can sit for hours and watch Bryan Cranston act but this whole execution of an attempt to make a movie was a total miss by it's creators. Cranston is amazing to see and hear and to see him pull this sloppy story and script off with the class he brings is a a miracle. The makeup was terrible and inconsistent. The music score didn't know what it wanted to be (minimalistic, adventurous, Clint-Eastwoodesk Piano style, Jazz, Noir..) it's all over the place. The Down Syndrome actors where a disgrace to watch at, the director or editor or casting agent should be ashamed for the way these characters are brought to the screen and the way the are portrait as story filler / forced-endearing tool. There's more then smiling, pointing and repeating names and words! And the most disappointing thing of it all. The ending! I understand you want to play off the whole 'open end' feeling, but this is just bad bad writing and cinematic execution. We do not need any more discomfort at the end, it's been enough of that sitting through it all.",/review/rw5073590/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2018,Love_Life_Laughter,9," The ultimate suburban nightmare (contains spoilers)
","Wakefield, as the name suggests, is the story of a man named Howard Wakefield who ""awakens"" to discover that his family does not want, need, miss or love him. The journey to this realization is suspenseful and at some point, if you are really tracking, your heart breaks for him. 
At first, hiding in the garage attic spying on his wife and kids for months at a time, watching them go from surprise, to grief, to healing, to an enjoyment of daily life far more satisfying than his dour nature would allow, seems the ultimate in manipulation and as a result, nothing more than Howard deserves. But there is more to Howard than his compulsive spying. His isolation manifests in a heightened spiritual childlike joy in nature. And his journey also reveals his deep love for his wife, whom he wooed and won to spite a challenger, but who is now absolutely central to his world. Howard makes his final move when that old challenger comes back into her life, months after Howard's closet is emptied, and the family's celebrations of the Christmas holiday demonstrate real and true joy without him. Howard then makes the sacrifice of returning to his family, so that they can find closure and get on with the business of ejecting and replacing him with his old rival. It is clear his wife will never know of either his deep feelings nor of his sacrifice; nor will she care. 
The existential despair of the male provider, the ostensible head of the family, has never been so beautifully wrought. Is he loved for himself, or as a meal ticket? This question was touched upon during the last episode of Mad Men, when Don Draper reacted sympathetically to a male participant of a support group who claimed that no one spoke to him at the dinner table. Howard was a man determined to find out what was behind that dining room table silence, and heartrendingly, succeeded in answering that question. A beautiful film noir that looks at the dark underbelly of the ""successful"" head of the household and the emotional price men can pay for their financial power. I think Brian Cranston deserves an Oscar. Nine stars because this film is just too darn creepily close to some very uncomfortable truths.",/review/rw5073590/?ref_=tt_urv

","Successful, but discontent suburban lawyer Howard Wakefield (superbly played by Bryan Cranston) decides to step away from his unrewarding humdrum lifestyle by living in seclusion in the attic of his garage. However, Wakefield still keeps tabs on his estranged wife Diana (a sturdy portrayal by Jennifer Garner) and two daughters by spying on them from afar.",/review/rw5073590/?ref_=tt_urv

29 July 2017,dennismrobles,8," For mature movie watchers
","No, this movie is not like watching paint dry, it is about watching a person drop out and tune into the petty and superficial aspects of the self. Rather it's a ""nervous breakdown"" or not Cranston does wonders with his physiognomy and gait. No, this is not an action movie or a RomCom, but a study in character and psychology does require patience, as does sipping a good glass of wine, no need to gulp, enjoy the moments, the good and the bad.",/review/rw5073590/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2016,laabstract,9," An epic exploration into voyeurism
","Modern adults flirt with this idea of leaving everything behind and starting again from scratch, this kind of ideology has been used in pieces of Americana to include tales of the mountain man. A single solitary figure who is seemingly in control of his own destiny, even if it's a solitary one. ""Wakefield"" is a film that negotiates these ideas of solitude, abandonment and puts a voyeuristic spin on the concept. Writer and director Robin Swicord known for writing such great films as ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" (2008) ""The Jane Austen Book Club"" (2007) and ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" (2005) brings her adaptation of loneliness and love to the big screen in ""Wakefield"".",/review/rw5073590/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2017,p-k-adey,8," Brilliant Performance by Bryan Cranston
","I thoroughly enjoyed watching Bryan Cranston's character devolve, much as his character in Breaking Bad did. He does a wonderful job showing us what made his character do what he did. Jennifer Garner is great as his wife. Beverly D'Angelo is amusing as Jennifer Garner's mother. There are dark moments, but also periods of levity. Bryan Cranston has to carry the majority of the film as we see everything through his eyes or as he interprets it. It is a unique way to show a person as they go through a possible break down. Who among us hasn't wanted to walk away from our life at some point? And haven't we wondered if we'd be missed and by whom? A must see film!",/review/rw5073590/?ref_=tt_urv

14 September 2017,blanbrn,7," A film that's different it shows life from one's own point of view, with isolation.
","""Wakefield"" is a different kind of film it shows what it's like when one takes their own self out of the daily rat race of life and hides away to reflect and watch the world from their own point of view. The story is around Howard Wakefield(Bryan Cranston)a high powered attorney who has it all only one day he decides to remove himself from life and family after a breakdown of nerves and go away and live in the attic. As in his time away Howard does reflect on the past with life, choices, and family, and sees the wife away from a distant view as his love now is just sight seeing of Diana(the sexy Jennifer Garner)who's an elegant and upscale trophy black bra wearing kind of wife. Thru it all the world is now just a different take and look for Howard as he sees the reflection of light and life in the end. Overall good film that shows and proves that many should take a break and different look at life from an outsider approach as to isolate time and thoughts are many times good for the healing of the mind and soul.",/review/rw5073590/?ref_=tt_urv
