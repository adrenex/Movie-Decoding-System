19 September 2018,PIST-OFF,10," for once the academy got it right
","With all due respect to Eastwood's American Sniper, the academy actually got it right with this pick for best picture. Every actor and actress in this given the space to breathe life into characters, every monologue and dialogue hits like a ton of bricks, every scene tries to get towards some fundamental truth of human nature only to have the next scene undermine that character and that purported truth. It's amazing that in the era of comic book universe movies that something like this can get made at all. An absolute must see before you die movie.",/review/rw3158457/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2017,TheLittleSongbird,9," Very much a divisive film, to me it was a 2014 highlight
","Despite the near-universal acclaim from critics, 'Birdman' very much divided audiences to a quite extreme degree. This division is very much understandable, 'Birdman' has a great many merits but not everything will work for everybody.",/review/rw3158457/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2015,CalRhys,," True Definition Of A Masterpiece
","Whilst viewing 'Birdman', I spent the first hour of the film trying to decipher my emotions and opinions towards it, what I was watching was a weird, yet wonderful work of art. Truly though, 'Birdman' is a technical masterpiece. Michael Keaton has generally been undermined as an actor (despite a few notable roles as Batman or Beetlejuice) and has instead faced Hollywood picking more acclaimed and popular actors, 'Birdman' however might just be his ticket to an Oscar nomination, and possibly even a win, his performance is mesmerising. Alejandro González Iñárritu has created a truly spectacular character study that arguably features this year's strongest acting performances, alongside a well- executed script, booming soundtrack and a monumental achievement with cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki in which he attempts a Hitchcockian approach, reminiscent of 'Rope', and displays the story through a seemingly single and unbroken sweeping shot. This is the true definition of a masterpiece.",/review/rw3158457/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have a tendency to check user reviews on IMDb before watching a film. I was surprised to see how divided people were for Birdman. Most of the reviews were either 9-10 stars or 1 star. This made me want to watch the film even more and by the time I finished watching it, my faith in people had decreased by a little bit. ",/review/rw3158457/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2014,ClaytonDavis,10," Using the ""M"" Word Again...Masterpiece!
","I think we've all been exceptionally good this year because Christmas came early with Alejandro González Iñárritu's masterful ""Birdman (or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance),"" an experience that you won't soon forget. Debuting at Venice and Telluride Film Festivals, the film closed an already impeccable New York Film Festival on Saturday morning for press and industry colleagues. It's a film that resonates profoundly, and may just be the best film of 2014. From its pristine writing (by Iñárritu, Armando Bo, Nicolas Giacobone, and Alexander Dinelaris), to its carefully constructed direction and cinematography, to its genius casting and performances, ""Birdman"" is just a dream of a movie.",/review/rw3158457/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Birdman"" is the latest overpraised and over-hyped ""art"" film by the acclaimed director Alejandro González Iñárritu. Michael Keaton, who was known for playing Batman in the late 80s and early 90s, is cast here as Riggan Thomson, a washed-up Hollywood actor, once famous for playing a superhero Birdman character in the movies, now making a comeback on Broadway, acting in an adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story.",/review/rw3158457/?ref_=tt_urv

","There's always a slot for a movie every calendar year for the one film that everyone praises but hardly anyone understands, likes, or comes close to fathom why it receives such accolades. ""Birdman"" and its entire cast and crew (with the exception of Keaton) have taken that spot, dislodging ""Boyhood"" out of this position. Still, ""Boyhood"" had Ethan and Arquette, which made it passable.",/review/rw3158457/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2015,planktonrules,6," Good parts, but the film is too familiar and seems quite overrated.
","At this time, ""Birdman"" has a phenomenal IMDb score of 8.7 and has been talked about a lot in regards to the Oscars. Whether the film does get the nominations (particularly for Michael Keaton) is something we'll know in the next few weeks. As for me, however, I really do think the film is quite overrated--and the biggest reason is that so much of it I've seen before--such as in Fellini's ""8 1/2"" and a few films that have copied this, such as Woody Allen's ""Stardust Memories"". The movie, at least to crazed film buffs like me, just lacks the originality to be a great film and it seems overrated.",/review/rw3158457/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2021,KissEnglishPasto,10," Life Imitating Art or Art Imitating Life...Can Anyone Tell the Difference? Does It Really Matter?
","BIRDMAN just keeps coming at you, time and again, from every imaginable angle, until the end credits, about an hour and 50 minutes in. Is it just me ....or are many reviewers reluctant to state the obvious? Michael Keaton as a down on his luck Ex-Superhero, desperately trying to prove his relevance in 2015, to the entire world, to his rather distant family, but, probably most of all, to himself. Oh yeah, and he talks to himself in a rather smooth, but hoarse and gravelly BATMAN...I mean BIRDMAN, Superhero voice, his last on screen portrayal of which was in 1992!

","A bunch of very good actors, all wasted in an indulgent pretentious script, and even more indulgent and pretentious directing. the pseudo arts use of a drum soundtrack, the long boring hand held tracking shot, oh look i am doing all this in one take. the absolutely stupid plot, that takes ages to go nowhere, a film where the film maker is saying very loudly and in a very boring way, look how clever i am, why this has been praised by critics is beyond me. Actually to be honest i have now long given up on what critics say and write about a film. Virtually critic on both sides of the Atlantic seem to have lost any sense of what is good or bad. The amount of critically endorsed films that i have thought to be not bad but very bad seems to be growing each year. i have been a serious movie goer for some time now. i also have noticed that after a year or so these lauded films seem to get reconsidered , where the original praise is vastly reduced.",/review/rw3158457/?ref_=tt_urv

23 May 2015,Hitchcoc,7," Certainly an Ambiguous Challenge
","Michael Keaton and Edward Norton are terrific. They are wonderful actors in nearly every sense of the word. I was engaged most of the way, but then the flying sequences. He is indeed a broken man. He is probably schizophrenic, listening to himself discuss his failures through the persona of the character he used to play. Enough has been written about this movie (it was the darling of the Oscars) for me to offer much. Nevertheless, I feel that we need to play fair with the audience. If this was a demonstration of what is wrong with Broadway and the Broadway crowd, let us know. There is a great scene where he confronts a powerful theatre critic who can make or break a show with a bad review (I never understood the power of these people) and chastises her for her vindictiveness and and arrogance in ruining peoples lives when she, herself, must not face the music. I'm sure her editors would disagree, but what he says is true. Unfortunately, as we roll to the end, we are made to make up our minds. I suppose it's OK not to be one with the character, but the ending is truly ambiguous, to a fault. Fantastic acting by the whole cast, yet it left me really cold at the end.",/review/rw3158457/?ref_=tt_urv

","At one point in Birdman ""or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"", Michael Keaton as 'celebrity turned serious actor' Riggan Thomson rants at a vicious New York Times critic Tabitha (the excellent Lindsay Duncan – – ""About Time""; ""Dr Who: Waters of Mars"") about how all critics lamely fall on ""labels"" and ""comparisons"" to describe their subjects, never getting to the guts of how the art made them actually FEEL.

16 October 2014,trublu215,10," Sweeping cinematography mixed with brilliant performances makes Birdman one of the very best of the year.
","Birdman is a brilliant, mind blowing experience that is filled with grand performances, Hitchcock-esque camera movements and a brilliant way of storytelling. Above all, Birdman's all star cast featuring Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone and Zach Galifinakis propel this film to greatness, telling the story of a has been actor, Riggan, who was once known for a comic book franchise from yesteryear as he struggles to regain the stardom he once had through an off Broadway play. This proves to be harder and harder for Riggan as he deals with the disappointments of his own life while dealing with the difficulties of making this play his ticket back to stardom. This film serves as a somewhat personal film to Michael Keaton, giving the mere fact that he was known for playing Batman, a comic book hero eerily similar to Birdman. Keaton is an actor that proved time and time again that he can play virtually anything from heavy and hard hitting dramatic roles to silly and funny comedic roles as well. In Birdman, he strikes a perfect balance between the two and turns in the best performance of his entire career. He is firing on all cylinders and truly rises to perfection especially in scenes with an equally great Edward Norton. Another highlight of Birdman is the cinematography. First off, WOW. This film has some of the best cinematography I have seen in quite some time. Focusing on extremely long and spiraling takes, it submerses you in the scene, giving you the type of voyeuristic experience that Birdman calls for. We very much follow these actors as if we're watching a documentary on LSD. The camera movements are slow and bouncy, the tracking shots are nothing short of amazing and it gives an overall, dream like experience when watching this film, something that really benefits the film towards the latter half of it. I fully expect the film's Director of Photography Emmanuel Lubezki to score a Best Cinematography nomination come Oscar time. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has given us some new age classic films such as Babel, Biutiful, and 21 Grams. Birdman is no exception and, to be honest, this very well may be his masterpiece. He directs his actors with grace and never lets them miss a beat and with some extreme long takes throughout the film, it shows just how good of a director he is and just how good his actors can be, especially Michael Keaton. Overall, I could go on and on about this film and just how great it is but nothing of what I say here can really do Birdman justice. It is a film that you need to experience for yourself. With that being said, Birdman features amazing performances including a jaw dropping turn from Michael Keaton, along with some of the best cinematography I've seen in years. If there is one film to see during the Awards season, it is Birdman.",/review/rw3158457/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2014,scifiactionfan,2," wow...so bad
","It is the most boring film ever. I wonder why so many people love it. Every time I started to get interested, they would play that annoying jazz drumming. My friend said it was better than ""The Judge"", not even close. From start to finish, that moving is an interesting story. From start to finish, I didn't care about any of the characters in this film. It won't get wide release because it won't appeal to most people. I have a theory that it will appeal to people that like jazz. It'll win awards because it appeals to critics. Oh, a spoiler, the plot is boring. I will say the actors did a really good job.

3 February 2015,PartialMovieViewer,1," Bad – Awful – Horrible – and I am Being Nice
","Obviously I did not like this movie. There was no beginning – no middle – and no ending. For me – one big question mark led to another and then to another and then to another – pretty much non-stop. The story might have been more digestible had there been answers to the questions – but there were none. Additionally, that jittery, jumpy camera work - so awe-inspiring for some critics - was just plain irritating to me. Also, I did not care about this mythical ego-battle between Hollyweird and ""The THEATER."" This phony megalomania is false, since it is easily squashed when THEATER elites are offered a shot at the big screen. Once Tinsel-Town beckons, those bright lights of Broadway quickly become short-lived memories, vanishing as soon as the twinkling radiance disappears from the actor's rear-view-mirror. Oh and the actors, what happened? Every character (with the exception of the Zach Galifianakis') was not just flawed, but were all socially destroyed. Every scene opened with whimpering or fighting or complaining – it was one emotional train-wreck after another. ""Birdman"" was definitely no comedy, that is for sure. Other than the relief I felt leaving the cinema, I can only site one redeeming scene. That scene would have to be the snarky spat between the Michael Keaton character and the THEATER critic. This obvious demonizing of critics was so well woven into the story, with subtle intent. It didn't really appear that important to the movie's success. Oh but I think it was vital. Even if the scene of the two of them arguing came across as your typical, ""Birdman"", scene-by-scene mindless banter, I feel there was another reason for this. To me, it appears as a very successful 'warning-off' of negative reviews - and for that I say bravo and award one star. To be truthful, I had a hard time writing this review. I did not like this movie, and espousing my negativity was easy. That is not where my problem lies. On other movies, I actually agree with what many views my fellow reviewers' have penned in the past. On this flick, I must disagree. This movie was not my favorite; is not my favorite, and will never be my favorite.",/review/rw3158457/?ref_=tt_urv
