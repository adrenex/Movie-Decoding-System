28 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," One of the most underrated comedies ever!
","As you can tell by reading through most of these reviews, Arrested Development is loved by just about everyone who's seen it. It ended only after three seasons which was way too soon for such a great show. Netflix renewed it 8yrs after it went off the air. Season 3 was in 2005 and it wasn't until 2013 until season 4 finally made its debut. But those first few seasons were so good that it didn't still have to put this among my favorite sitcoms of all-time! It's about the Bluth family and how one of the sons, Micheal Bluth (Jason Bateman), takes over the family business and affairs when his father George Bluth (Jeffrey Tambor) goes to prison. This family is so dysfunctional that they make Michaels life impossible. If you haven't seen this yet then do yourself a favor and watch it asap!",/review/rw8187579/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2021,Supermanfan-13,9," So Funny!
","Arrested Development really is one of the funniest and most underrated tv shows ever created, especially the first three seasons! As most of the reviews have already said the quality dropped off for the last 2 seasons when it came back after taking a few years off. But those first few seasons were so good that it makes this show an all-time great sitcom!",/review/rw8187579/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2022,vonnoosh,8," ""What has gotten into you? Have you been eating cheese?""
","10 stars belong to the Fox network run of the series. I still remember watching the debut season on Sunday evenings. The netflix reboot was just.........wrong and I knocked off 2 stars because it feels little more than a knock off than an actual continuation of the show. The reboot feels like there's 2/3rds less comedy in each episode compared to the shows in the first 3 seasons. Also, it does a really lousy job trying to pick things up years down the line. More clumsy than offbeat funny. They really could have done better. Maybe it tries too hard but its years too late, maybe it forgot the show had likable characters, maybe it was too busy trying to be a political allegory instead of being funny like, a sitcom. I guess it's true what they say about any art. You can't go back and pretend it's the same. Then again, there's a few netflix reboots that failed miserably after moving to that streaming service (Designated Survivor anyone??].",/review/rw8187579/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2004,Snoopy1,," Very funny
","This show takes a few episodes before you *really* GET it.  And once you get it, you'll realize why everybody thinks it's one of the best sitcoms ever.",/review/rw8187579/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2023,Lukasmj,8," Very good, when you don't watch the last seasons.
","His family drives Michael Bluth to despair: his father George is in custody for fraud. His mother Lucille thinks only of the damaged image of the family. His older brother, Gob, is such an unsuccessful wizard that even the Mages Union threw him out. Younger brother Buster is 30 and still a mama's boy. Then there's his sister Lindsay, who is in a bizarre marriage to ex-psychiatrist and untalented actor Dr. Tobias Funke leads.",/review/rw8187579/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,jimdbs,9," Score out of 10 by season: 1 - 9, 2 - 10, 3 - 8, 4&5 - 5
","The main score is excluding the last 2 seasons. Judging by the first 3 seasons, this is one of the best sitcoms ever made but various factors led to it not doing so well while it ran and getting cut. It became a lot more popular after it had ended and word of mouth got around about how great it was. Due to popular demand and the show being cut so soon, there were rumors about it being revived for years but unfortunately that didn't happen until Netflix decided to pick it up about 7 years after the last season.",/review/rw8187579/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10," One of the funniest and smartest shows I have seen
","I have seen a lot of great shows and a few bad ones. Arrested Development is brilliant, at least in my view. The show is well made visually, with very nice photography and sets that don't look cheap in any way. The music is memorable, particularly the theme tune, the story lines are well-structured with any big themes executed cleverly and the writing and jokes are some of the funniest and smartest I've seen. The characters are admittedly strange, but they are also unique and have their likability too, while the acting from the whole cast is consistently top-notch and the show even uses their guest stars in a creative way. All in all, funny, smart and engaging, quite simply a brilliant show. 10/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw8187579/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2022,Paddurick,8," 8/10
","One of the best American comedies. Really clever and consistently funny. Amazing performances from all character, not a single weak link and rarely a dull moment in the show. Quality.",/review/rw8187579/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2006,nightswatch,10," UNparalleled
","You've doubtless heard fans rave and rave about this show, and may have even checked it out. The camp is sharply divided, people either absolutely love it, or tend to just ""not get it."" In that sense it may not be for everyone (great television, and great art in general, rarely is), and to each his own. But after watching each season multiple times, I can easily say that it is the funniest show that I have ever seen by an ENORMOUS margin. Even after many repeat viewings, I still end up in tears all the time.",/review/rw8187579/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2022,safenoe,10," The first three seasons
","I have only watched the first three seasons and I wish I could rate this 11/10 but IMDb doesn't allow this. Anyway, Arrested Development is smart and whipsmart all at once. So much has been written about Arrested Development, and what more can I add? The direction, writing and acting is smart and subversive without a doubt.",/review/rw8187579/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2004,metalgoth,," Great TV
","Strange, Fox's promos almost made me miss out on this whole thing.",/review/rw8187579/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2003,AlphabetCity,10," The smartest thing Fox has done yet
","This is the funniest show currently on television. All you need to enjoy this show is an appreciation for high-quality acting and incredibly hilarious writing. Jason Bateman as Michael Bluth is perfect as the under-appreciated do-good guy who's just trying to keep his family together and himself sane. Other highlights of the show include Will Arnett as GOB (George Oscar Bluth II), Michael's lame-excuse-for-a-magician brother; Jeffrey Tambor as George Sr., Michael's incarcerated father (he was jailed for ""shifty accounting practices""); and Michael Cera as George Michael Bluth, Michael Bluth's perpetually nervous 13-year-old son (who just happens to have a strange infatuation with his cousin, Maebe, played by ""State of Grace""'s Alia Shawkat). All in all this show is sure to be a hit, at least with those people whose level of understanding of comedy is above slapstick and bathroom jokes. TREMENDOUSLY hilarious writing and outstanding performances by the whole cast will have you laughing the whole time. Ten out of ten!",/review/rw8187579/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2022,masckerdoom,9," A New Beginning
","With a masterpiece of a first season, it perfected and pioneered a new industry of televised comedy, while simultaneously remaining unsurpassed in all the years of attempts to mimic its success.",/review/rw8187579/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2020,benps,10," Excluding season 4 & 5
","I'm excluding those seasons because I barley watched season 4 as it was unbearable, and I didn't even attempt to watch season 5. To me, Arrested Development is 3 incredible seasons of inventive, clever, witty television. This show was so funny. I loved the use of narration, visual gags, running gags, and how they contributed to the storytelling. It was always very well written, and the cast was amazing. They all bought something very distinct to their characters. I particularly liked Gob and Tobias the most, and Will Arnett and David Cross were both brilliant respectively. Loved this show, and it's a shame what it's slowly turned into.",/review/rw8187579/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2022,ITALUKE,9," Incredible.
",After seeing all the five seasons I can finalky write my review. Second season is my favourite season. The writing of the whole show is incredible and so is the comedy. I am so glad that this is not a show with dumb jokes. The cast is also incredible.,/review/rw8187579/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2003,crothman,," Hilarious comedy!
","Probably the best show of the 2003 season, and the best new comedy in years. It's very hard to describe, since the comedy is entirely character-based, not plot- or wisecrack-based.",/review/rw8187579/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2004,Nicholai,," HI-Larious as Well As Intelligent
","In this age of lazily-conceived, hastily-produced, fill-in-the-blank reality shows that the FOX network seems to corner the market on, it's refreshing to see them invest in a show that doesn't fit a clich√©d formula and challenges the audience's intellect with hilarious results.",/review/rw8187579/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2004,rdatsun,," Am I watching the same show you guys are watching?
","OK, seriously, after reading the recent past reviews of the show am starting to ask myself if you people are even giving the show at least five minutes of your time before rushing online to bash it. You guys are saying that season 2 is going downhill yet your not even explaining why the this season is so inferior to the first. I've seen the second season and I have to say it right on par with the first with more funny twist and situations that Michael and the Bluths have to deal with. Yes they changed some of the story lines now (George Sr. on the run, Gob taking over the company, Buster threating to join the army, and so forth) but THATS HOW SEASONS GO. If they kept the same storyline from the first the show would've haven't gotten repetitive before the first two episodes. And beside the show still retains it wit and subtle humor from the first show while continuing storyline from previous episodes. So really whats the problem with the second season? Cause all am hearing is whining and undeserved bashings from folks with short attention spans.",/review/rw8187579/?ref_=tt_urv

","First three seasons were like best thing you could see in a sitcom ever. But from 4th season it's all going downhill. I couldn't even get through season 5.

",What is the deal with season 5? Are George Michael and Maeby supposed to still be teenagers? Why do they call the model home George Michael's childhood home? I knew it was over when GM punched his dad. Another great show has been ruined.,/review/rw8187579/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2020,ahmedgorshy,10," The fourth and fifth season are not so bad and better than many bad seasons in The Office. However, you do not see the Office stay down
","The fourth and fifth season are not so bad and better than many bad seasons in The Office. However, you do not see the Office stay down
Frankly, I read all the reviews except 400 and they all talk about the greatness of the first seasons, which is agreed upon, plus the fourth season or the quality of them, but it was not bad and it contained a very excellent style, but the first three episodes are very bad except for the grief grief for Michael Bluth I did not laugh at anything but starting from The fifth episode Tobias episode laughed as I laughed before in the first seasons, then a boring episode came, but then the episode of Job Bluth came in the best season and one of the 10 best episodes I saw in the series and the rest of the season is excellent if what is the problem in the season ??? Are characters evolving? Maybe, but I laughed at the season and watched it a few times, getting louder and I'm totally happy with that season.
We move on to the fifth season and admit or five episodes, the worst of it, the rest is enjoyable, and the last episode, I cried at the magnificence
So what's the problem?
There are problems here and here but most of them are solved in the last episode Yes I hated some ridiculous conspiracies especially that related to Lindsay but the music was good and fans should know that the show was a masterpiece and is still a masterpiece and no matter how many seasons are offered it will still be better but all the fans gave the show rated 1 and 2 as if they did not laugh One day this is annoying and ungrateful. I have never seen any fan of The Office criticize or change the show's rating from 10 to 1 or 5 due to Michael Scone leaving and I think the eighth season of The Office was worse than any season in Arrested devolpemnt but not everyone Angry and wants to leave the series from the list of the best 250 TV shows. I saw the progression in 2015 and it was 9.1 and today 8.7 against you man. Why why just why do you do that
If you laughed in the first three times, return your rating to 10, please
The series should not come out from the list of the best in imdb, and remember only your series, that all series are from bad seasons to great ones, and don't let that affect your evaluation",/review/rw8187579/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2022,mathisstl,10," Reboot isn't canon

30 May 2022,annierat,10," I just had to give it a 10
","I love this show. The first three seasons at least. I couldn't not give it 10 even if the last two seasons were a little shakey. The first three seasons were absolute perfect comedy gold. Snappy jokes back to back to back you'll find something new to laugh at every-time you rewatch it. The whole storyline seemed so well thought out and planned. Should have never been cancelled so soon. With that being said season 4 was definitely rough. Didn't seem as jam packed with jokes and the format just didn't work as well. The jokes about George Micheal aging were very funny though. I will say I think they definitely picked out the game in season 5, the gob storyline was absolutely hilarious. Season 5 still can't touch the first 3 original seasons however. It's tragic such a perfect comedy had to end not as great as it started.",/review/rw8187579/?ref_=tt_urv
