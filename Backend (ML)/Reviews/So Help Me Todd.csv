9 October 2022,cockezville,9," Enjoying this
","It is a difficult thing to do, a comic drama,but this show manages to do that with finesse and style. Marcia Gay Hardin and Skylar Astin as mother/son collaborators in crime work. I have never seen Marcia Gay do comedy and she does well. Skyler Astin is a hoot and so charismatic. They play off each other so well. The supporting cast all do their jobs well. When I heard that Geena Davis had left the project I was not expecting much as that often sparks trouble, but she is not missed in the show. I love the deadpan sister who appears in the show and the nasty co worker who assigns Skylar's character to a storage room for an office. The comedic aspect of the show is what drives it and makes it different from another procedural. Thursday night is a good spot. One of my favorites this season.",/review/rw8672746/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2022,toncincin,10," Finally!
",A great vehicle for Skylar Astin! Loved him in the Pitch Perfect movies and on Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist. Nice to see him in a non-musical role. He's got the talent - for sure. Such a diverse guy.,/review/rw8672746/?ref_=tt_urv

","Somebody wrote ""This show must have been written either for 12 to 14 year olds or to placate lunatics. It is silly in the extreme."" Another... ""This series could have easily been a much watch. However, the writers have taken the script to a silly, constant comedy that loses its appeal. "" If these folks want serious drama... they should find it. I like the fact that it's a mixture of serious and down right stupid... in a fun way. The characters are being developed nicely and there is a warn family caring tone being developed, And as far as ""wokeness"" some folks need to get over themselves and realize where they are in time. I like the damn show... simple fun.",/review/rw8672746/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2022,lisacarlson,10," Marcia Gay Hardin is the reason to watch
","Love Hardin in anything she does. I can't for a moment see Geena Davis in the role. CBS probably had to pay her to get her to come to television. The networks seem to be doing it lately with Queen Latifah and Hillary Swank. Hardin seems to be enjoying this role. She's smart, classy and funny here as an attorney and mom. Her co-star is equally good. The mother and son dynamic feels realistic. The rest of the cast is rather invisible but that could be elevated by the writing. It's refreshing to come back to network television when there's actually genuine writing and there's only one episode that drops each week.",/review/rw8672746/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2022,marygreen25,9," One of the better shows
",So Help Me Todd is a fun legal dramedy mystery series with good performances. The running gags are humorous and the character development introduced so far is compelling. Can't find fault with anything about it. It's a light show not a serious detective drama. Very watchable. Hardin is a curmudgeon sometimes offers good contrast with Astin playing her private eye son whose recovering from bad decisions. I look forward to seeing how the show progresses and am optimistic it will get better. It's no Better Call Saul but it could get there. Maybe a karaoke scene is required to get some singing in the show!!,/review/rw8672746/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2022,shamblerbatman,9," Unexpectedly Charming
","I have to say that when I saw the idea behind the show I wasn't immediately taken by this. But then I got VERY sick and was stuck at home and it felt like I'd watched everything, so I gave it a shot. Wow... I was so surprised how much I enjoyed it.",/review/rw8672746/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,earthman-638-366680,8," The chemistry is getting better...
","5 episodes in and I still want more. It's entertaining. The chemistry is getting better as each episode happens. And after you realize that the distant relationship between the characters in the beginning is part of the underlying backstory, it's easy to start liking them all. I'm enjoying the show and the acting. It's not like they're going for an Oscar or something. It's one of those shows that you just let happen and it pays you back with a few twists and turns, a couple laughs and satisfying story-lines. Enjoy it with a cocktail or something else that helps you smile. I think this show is going to be a good one to binge on a cold winters night once a few seasons are in the can.",/review/rw8672746/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,hazangel-89910,8," Fun
",This show is so much fun! The banter between Todd and his mother is epic. Todd is likeable and a cutie. The sister is interesting. Why is she always eating? There must be some significance. If you have time it's a great binge watching show. The 45 minutes really does fly by. I hope it gets a second season. It looks like there is a second one scheduled but one never knows.... Not sure if this happened to anyone else but Prime is missing an episode. That's random. Not sure what happened but hopefully it shows up soon. So as of now I there are only 6 episodes to watch but I believe there should be 7.,/review/rw8672746/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2022,PoppySeed16,," Finally something cute to watch!
","Love this show so far!!!! It's so cute, a bit dramatic, but perfect this day and age!!! With so many things on tv that are regurgitated, boring and downright awful I'm so glad they made something that's light and cute to watch!!!! We can finally watch something on tv that's not over complicated and completely new.",/review/rw8672746/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2022,bowieec,7," Pretty silly story lines and I love it!
","This show reminds me of any number of shows on the USA Network in the late 90s or early 2000s. The little mysteries are solvable within minutes of the story unfolding and much of what happens in each episode is seriously convoluted and utterly ridiculous. But I can't help watching it and I just love the show. It's really about the cast. Marcia Gay Harden, Skylar Astin, and Madeline Wise perfectly embody their characters and have fantastic chemistry. The supporting cast is also very good. Across the board the actors are all in, embracing the silly, sometimes playing it perfectly straight, and sometimes a little wacky, and it just works! It's fun and silly and quirky and I think it will get better as time goes on and the writers and producers embrace what works and throw out what doesn't. I look forward to watching this each week as a distraction from the real world.",/review/rw8672746/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2022,oconnorcm-03179,10," Awesome new show!!!
","I loved it!! A great mixture of comedy, suspense and family drama!!!! I can't wait to watch it next week!!!! I laughed at the mom the way she goes on and on about the younger generation so attached to technology, but comes around when she realizes it's benefits. Looking forward to learning about the family dynamic, 3 kids, but 1 isn't not even listed in cast list??? The actor who is Todd is hysterical, but very serious and a smart investigator. I hope they keep this show gets great ratings and viewership, good clean family show!!!! I will definitely encourage others to watch!!!! CBS has a great Thursday night lineup!!!",/review/rw8672746/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2022,dbuckshnis,10," Superb ensemble
","This is like a modern day ""Get Smart"" or ""Murder She Wrote"", or ""Columbo"" or ""Monk"" or ""the Mentalist"" ... very enjoyable. But I love Marsha and Todd is great. Their slapstick acting is well executed but a little bit overacting on the mother-son relationship at times. But really it's all about Marsha.",/review/rw8672746/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,Avidviewer-02847,4," Haven't pulled the plug on it, but hope it improves.
","I like Marcia Gay Harden, I've seen her in many movies and TV episodes, she's a good actress. I question some of the casting, not the caliber of Harden. It has that style of a New York City comedic drama, but it says it's set in Portland, Oregon. Or maybe it's really filmed in Vancouver, BC and uses exterior shots from Portland. Probably New York City writers setting a TV series in Portland, but it's still very NYC.",/review/rw8672746/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2022,mweratcliffe,4," Its a show
","This show may get better as episodes are released but the pilot is on par with the quality of a Hallmark movie - just ok. The relationships between characters are ridiculously 1960's comedy. The comedy is based on misunderstandings, miscommunication and an inability for writers to let characters say what real people would say in order to create artificial tension comedy drama cuteness - whatever. The musical track running throughout is just dumb implying that there is continuous suspense when almost nothing at all is happening. I would say the acting is good but that would be a lie. Really not great - the best that can be said is that its a show.",/review/rw8672746/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2022,rtailor-04901,10," This is So Good! Pure Entertainment!
",Oh how I love to watch dysfunctional but loving families in series with genius writers and actors! This is so well acted and written. Of course Marsha is smashing in her role as an uber stiff defense attorney but I have never seen the actor who plays her son before! He is so good! He plays the part perfectly as the brilliant but bumbling son. I was worried he would overplay it but he stops right at the line. Brilliant. This show is great. It's a feel good one with impeccable professional actors. I love the sister as well. She I have seen before. Watch this and laugh and smile. You deserve it!!!,/review/rw8672746/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,yerlo,9," Relaxing and engaging dramedy
","No F bombs, no porn nor explicit intimacy--or any intimacy (euphemism) at all. GREAT! That junk never adds to the plot and it takes no writing skills at all. Maybe trying to be edgy? It's tacky and boring. It's used as filler instead of good writing and story development. Big plus is I can watch it with any family member--nieces, nephews, mom, church ladies.",/review/rw8672746/?ref_=tt_urv

7 October 2022,nananow,3," Forced frenetic
","Almost impossible to watch given adults interacting artificially and trying too hard to be cute. Of course, wokeness interwoven but attempting to be subtle. Gave it a (3) out of respect to Ms. Hardens reputation. Efforts to set her up as brilliant but marginalized falls flat however. The mother\son relationship is odd to say the least. Luckily Ms. Hardens natural talent peaks through this travesty periodically. However, the constant bickering and attempts at comedic action is reprehensible. This only reinforces the constant need to play to supposed idiots. Perhaps go less heavy on the mamas boy scenario and more on Todd's actual ability. And, less obvious office disdain all around would grate less.",/review/rw8672746/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,Ed-Shullivan,4," I really thought this series would be good. 👎
",Ohhh so disappointed. Marcia Gay Harden is one of my favourite actresses and I really wanted to see her succeed in her new TV series in which she plays a lawyer trying to break the glass ceiling. Her co star is Skylar Astin who plays Todd a tarnished private detective living under a cloud of shame due to a past indiscretion.,/review/rw8672746/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2022,jbrbsmom,5," Slapstick version of the good wife
","Meh. Truly has the feel of what "" The Good Fight"" or "" The Good Wife"" would be like if done on Saturday Night Live. Even reference Alicia Florrick to try to give itself some connection, which feels oddly out of place. I am not quite sure what to make of it. Some of the ridiculousness is just so over the top and the characters feel overdone and then in other moments the comedy is a little darker and there are attempts at reality over ridiculousness and that incongruity is awkward.",/review/rw8672746/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2023,d-robold,2," Irritating
","Would love to see some grownups in this show. Seems like a 15 year old's version of idiotic, immature adults. Todd is a self absorbed, childish, whiny, and generally unlikable. He has moments in each episode when he pulls pieces of the case together and is trying hard, but then the writers always seem to send him back to the level of a teenager. He doesn't pay bills, he freeloads off his sister and mother, he expects everything to be his, even his sister's cereal. The whining about everything is atrocious.",/review/rw8672746/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,funderburkemckinley,1," Great actors, poor writers
