","I saw the trailer for the 2022 Spanish movie ""Cerdita"" (aka ""Piggy"") somewhere and it left an impression on me, because as soon as writer and director Carlota Pereda's movie was available, I had to sit down and watch it. And I was actually harboring some expectations to the movie, after having seen the trailer.",/review/rw8618895/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2022,urkus,8," Veru good Spanish movie!!
","Two thumbs up!! For the characters, for the editing, directing and of course: acting. The main character portrayed by an unknown actress for me (Sara/Piggy) in the movie is simply the best of the film. The father of the family also and the Basque actor, wich I know Amets Otxoa does a good acting for a young and new actor. Carmen Machi is as always brilliant.",/review/rw8618895/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,kosmasp,10," Carrying her weight
",No pun intended - the movie may not go the route you expect it to go ... well at least not all the time. Because we can understand certain things and we can understand that someone is more complex than their exterior image! Because the title character is not just defined by her body. Unfortunately it is what defines her for many kids who are her age ... and who bully her to say the least.,/review/rw8618895/?ref_=tt_urv

","Saw this last at ParaCinema Film Fest (Derby UK). I swear there was a wringer in the auditorium and that I had been pulled through it! Probably the most emotional (sad) I've been made to feel by any film, certainly in the horror genre.",/review/rw8618895/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2022,advimrankhalid,7," Fun ride
",The piggy is a very good thrill ride all the way to the end. I saw it's trailer sometime before and I really liked it. The lead performer did a great job and acted very well. Also her mother performed very well. It could be a10/10 movie but it just lack some storytelling I guess. From start to the end it held my attention and the ending was also very good. The movie also gave a good motive to not to bully other person. All in all its a fun thrill ride and held your interest till the end I think YouTube channel alter showed its trailer two or three years ago I can't fully remember. Anyway good watch fun movie recommended.,/review/rw8618895/?ref_=tt_urv

30 August 2022,BA_Harrison,8," It's not over until the fat lady kills.
","Overweight teen Sara (Laura Gal√°n) is mercilessly bullied by her peers, the cool girls of the town, who call her Piggy and make rude posts about her on social media. After another cruel incident at the local swimming pool, Sara is left to walk home in just her swimming costume; on the way, she witnesses her tormentors being abducted by a man in a van. The man sees Sara; angry and scared, Sara does nothing as the man drives away.",/review/rw8618895/?ref_=tt_urv

26 October 2022,SoumikBanerjee25,6," It did not realise its full potential!
","The notions were right there, and those were certainly intriguing, and the architects behind have had all the plausible resources, one would require to deliver a product that may resonate with competence and a specific flair that this genre endearingly strives but thanks to a substandard direction, and convoluted writing, the entire proposition fell short of attaining their due goals as well as their somewhat deserved success.",/review/rw8618895/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2022,msvicki1224,3," This movie should of been called DUMMY!!!
",This has got to be one of the DUMBEST movies I've seen this year!!! So Ms piggy saves the lives of the women who bullied her as well as humiliated her on more than one occasion!!! How much sense does that make??? The way they picked on her from the very beginning was awful and very disrespectful to not only piggy but to her parents!!! I get that you should forgive and not hold grudges against people but those girls were too nasty!!! I wouldn't have done anything to those girls myself because I'm a believer that karma will catch up to them but I wouldn't have helped them either if I were put in that situation. The guy helped her out so it MADE ABSOLUTELY no sense to me when she killed him!!! This movie could've been sooooooo much better than what it was especially if the ending was different!!! I thought piggy was going to get revenge on the girls for herself not the guy. Those reasons alone are why my rating is so low!!!!,/review/rw8618895/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2022,jussipekkaturunen,7," Cruel movie, but fascinating to follow
","From technical point of view, the movie is probably 6 stars movie. However, the movie does small and little things right and it does the basic stuff right. After the final act, it almost feels like I want to give it 8 because the movie concludes everything what is required considering what the movie gives at the first act. Story gets captivating to follow that what is going to happen next. It's actually brilliant in that sense.",/review/rw8618895/?ref_=tt_urv

","Overall not a bad movie . The ""bullying"" is horrible üò≠ üíî personally anyone did that to my teenage daughter or kid in general ... Try to drown them with a fishing net in a public pool and steal their clothes and bag. I would , turn into a "" devil"" and catch the ******### on a dark night üòÜ ... The psycho that tried to help her actually did well , although he likley took it to far...and ended up with "",piggy"" actually fighting with him and killing him .. and then she turns against them ,, but. Likely so would I. After what they did ...let them rott. ?? At the end she is picked up from a friend on a bike covered in bloody and acts as if she's done nothing ..... Odd film.",/review/rw8618895/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,AndSoForth,6," Took the wrong route
","Laura Gal√°n was convincing in her role and the movie is well directed. Only wish they would have stuck to the thriller genre as so much more could have come out of it. When the story entered horror territory, it just lost its charm, sense of realism and humor as well as its credibility. It also became somewhat expected and a bit of a letdown.",/review/rw8618895/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2022,jamalb-38618,10," Payback Hurts
","Piggy was amazing and it told a story of a teen that was a social outcast. Bullies and the whole town are into Piggy, but Sara has other plans. The guy was a killer, but he had a soft side for Sara. I wished that there was romance to spice it up, but here we are with a dramatic horror movie of someone that is called a pig due to their weight. When I watched it the dubbing to English was off and the mom was a bully to Sara and I felt bad. Sara actually did learn to grow up and defend herself when the guy shows up which is a sign of growth or something like that in a character trait. Would love to watch it again.",/review/rw8618895/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2022,arungeorge13,6," The protagonist needs better writing; still worth a watch! [+61%]
","What if the only person in the whole town who ""understands"" you is the kidnapper of your bullies? Would you do something about it? That's the pertinent dilemma put forward by writer-director Carlota Pereda's Piggy, with Laura Gal√°n in the lead. I got to know that this was developed from Pereda's own 2018 short film, and that shows. Expanding from a 14m short to a 1h 39m feature, the writer could have given more texture to Sara (or Piggy, as she's referred to by her bullying peers) and portrayed her inner conflicts more effectively. In the film, however, she is reduced to a few lines and generically staged torment. The bizarre equation between Sara and the kidnapper would have been something worth further exploration. They get two (or more?) solid scenes together, yet they barely converse.",/review/rw8618895/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2022,KawaiiKiwi,5," Nice, but missing something
","Piggy is a drama-horror movie about Sara, a young overweight girl who gets heavily picked on by a trio of mean girls, one of which is an old friend of hers. She is also the laughing stock of her small village, and lives with her overprotective mother and nonchalant father and brother.",/review/rw8618895/?ref_=tt_urv
