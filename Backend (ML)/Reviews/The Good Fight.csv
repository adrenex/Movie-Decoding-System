29 April 2018,hydearchie,5," I had to revise my review down...
","The Good Wife was one of my all time favourite TV shows and I really enjoyed the first series of this spin off. The cast is amazing and the original storyline was excellent. Sadly, the second series is becoming increasingly exhausting for the overemphasis on a surrealistic version of Trump's America as seen through Diane Lockhart's (stoned) eyes. This is an unfortunate direction for a show that along with the original was so good at capturing the legal and political stories of the day without becoming a partisan rant, which is what this feels like. It is a shame as there is plenty of interesting material to explore without betraying the makers' political bias; indeed, there is material from across the spectrum that is ripe for dramatisation.",/review/rw4096302/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2019,Vic_max,," Brilliant storytelling in Season 1, but then overly political ... and not as fun
","Many times I've thought that this one of the best programs on TV. It is has great acting, clever witty dialog and great stories. Like its predecessor, The Good Wife, many of the storylines are enticing food for thought.",/review/rw4096302/?ref_=tt_urv

15 March 2021,mafdenver,2," Season 4 is on the slippery slope down
","We seem to have descended into the vulgar and obscene - to go along with the victimhood of women and minorities. Crippling angst over politics and ""social issues"" is de rigueur for dramas these days. But it seems the (perhaps younger?) writers now feel the need for offensiveness in order to shock - who? The audience that supported the show? You kids go have fun with that but you've alienated us.",/review/rw4096302/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2021,MrDeWinters,1," When bias becomes propaganda
","Can't believe the dialogue in S5E1 29:40 where the black lawyer says that people in London think she is ""exotic"". London is one of the most diverse and multicultural cities. In the same scene the Jewish apprentice replies that apparently British people are prejudiced towards Jews. Unbelievable! That's not entertainment. That's political activism. Snide political comments, that's all you hear constantly in season 4 and 5.",/review/rw4096302/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2017,laughing_cat,4," Fights (and Fails) to Stay Relevant
","The Good Wife was one of the best series on TV and one of my favorites ever. Born from the same writers and creators, I was hoping this spin off, The Good Fight, would be a worthy successor. Unfortunately, it spun off and spun out. Crash and burn. A hard, messy burn that I guarantee will lose The Good Wife's dedicated audience--starting with this viewer.",/review/rw4096302/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2022,atischoo,1," Season 6..yikes!
","As someone who doesn't live in the US, it was rather bizarre to come across a ""legal drama"" soap that was so overtly a 'party political broadcast' (as we say here) on behalf of one of your two parties!",/review/rw4096302/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2018,disdainisme,2," Was good then it went downhill too fast
","It is nothing but anti Trump. I am not a Trump fan, in fact I never voted for him however this show has mentioned his name over 100 times in just a few episodes. Its nothing but a biased bash fest - how is this entertainment?",/review/rw4096302/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2021,shenzencowboy,7," End it now
",It's sad to see one of your favourite shows die. This has gone from being one of the best shows on TV to being a shadow of its former self. It used to be beautifully written and was biting in its criticism of U. S politics. The clever introduction of occasional cartoon style songs was a feature.,/review/rw4096302/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2020,DiogoVNeves,4," I have never done a 180ยบ turn on any TV Show until this one.
","I initially gave this show a 9 and if you're looking for na excellent legal drama look no further than The Good Fight Season 1 and even Season 2, but from there on out it plummeted.
The show has always been politically charged but it worked, it wasn't about poitics, politics was just part of the show, it made up some of the side stories and some characters journeys. Ultimately the show was about lawyers and their daily lives at top law firm in Chicago. Then, season 3 came and the term legal drama no longer applied. It rapidly went from legal drama to a show almost solely about politics. The tone completely changed and it became way too silly. And being a show about politics is not in itself necessarily a bad thing, I enjoyed The Newsroom which was very political and I enjoyed The West Wing very much as well, but this just became stupid.
It's not open minded or interesting. it is overlty and admitedly biased,, the show doesn't take an interesting political stance on anything. It is provocative in the worst way possible, it is simply a troll and more importantly, because of all this, It became unenjoyable.
And I'm very sad about it, I truly am, because I used to love it. The actors were amazing in it and still are, the characters, some of them I already knew from The Good Wife, (which was an awesome show btw) are excellent as well, but with no fault of their own they've become ridiculous, making decisions that simply do not match who they are or what they believe.
Because I loved the show I held out all the way through season 3 hoping it would get bettter, that it would go back to normal - it didn't.
I began watching the first episode of season 4 and it's still the same. I don't understand the showrunners' decision, so I simply stopped watching in the middle of the episode.
Before anyone goes into saying that it has anything to do with my political leanings, know that I do not identify with republicans at all, nor am I a Trump supporter in any way, quite the opposite. In fact if I were to place myself in the american political spectrum I would probably fall on the left side of it. That is really not the issue.
I really am sad to say that I will no longer be a viewer.",/review/rw4096302/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2020,akshunhiro,10," This has to be one of the best TV shows ever made
","The Good Fight is one of the few spin off shows that manages to outdo its predecessor. At its fundamental core, it's a legal drama, but that's almost secondary to what's really going on: a commentary on the absolute insanity that this world is becoming. No topic seems to be off the table for TGF, and the show's creators are intelligent in presenting all this controversial content in a very tongue-in-cheek way that challenges us to try and see the madness.",/review/rw4096302/?ref_=tt_urv

","First off this horrible music, the heck is this ""School House Rock"" seriously! Too political. Seasons 1&2 were really good, but Season 3 is awful, I pay for CBS Access just to watch this drama, I'm so disappointed. I'm not a Trump fan either, but it's utterly ridiculous how they continue to bash him every episode, and the new loud mouth irritating lawyer with his stupid unrealistic behavior in court, Season three is a far cry from 1&2.",/review/rw4096302/?ref_=tt_urv

23 May 2018,nyobatusa,1," If you can't change the world, pls change this garbage show
","Diving deeply low, and lowering the standards of The Good Wife show of which the soundtrack is far superior, this liberal left wing propaganda is the biggest embarrassment on tv to this day. The clueless naive writers and actors with 
artificial and superficial lines like ""if I can't change the world I want to change my little piece in it..."" are delivering hardly even good entertainment. Seriously? Such a deep wisdom you can learn there, they should get that patented...this newly found discovery from the bubble called hollywood in a company of crazies: self indulgent overrated overvalued know-it-alls.
And the prize for the biggest embarrassment goes to you, a little shameful oscar in your corner of the office for ""showing FLOTUS nude photo"". Your parents must be so proud.",/review/rw4096302/?ref_=tt_urv

18 March 2018,janvl0412,10," The Best Sight
","Take the ingredients that made ""The Good Wife"" a great watch (wonderful acting, great scripts, photography...), add a touch of extra female pow(d)er, shake it up, evaporate the dryness censorship can cause, and you've unleashed a delicious soufflรฉ that just keeps rising (just had a wonderful dinner).
With a mic showing in one of the first scenes of the first season, I was worried, unnecessarily so as everything turned out exquisite, each episode a treat leaving one craving the next serving. Hope I got you hungry enough to go on a binge if you haven't seen it yet.
""The Good Fight"" is the one recipe that calls for endless seasoning.",/review/rw4096302/?ref_=tt_urv
