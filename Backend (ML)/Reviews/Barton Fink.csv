14 January 2018,pmoreino7,8," Worth it
","I've read several critics' reviews comparing this show to Black Mirror as if it fails in comparison. I don't think that's accurate. Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams is visually, thematically and, most importantly, narratively interesting. What is real or normal? What makes a human? Meanwhile, there are at least 2 episodes from S4 of Black Mirror that don't measure up to what I've seen so far in Electric Dreams, and apparently I've been watching the dud episodes, per critics' reviews.",/review/rw3808034/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2021,SnoopyStyle,7," good
","This is an anthology series based on the works of futurist sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick. It's ten episodes switching back and forth between American production and British. Despite loving the Blade Runner franchise, I don't think I've ever read his work. This has a darker tone. Some of the British ones remind me of Black Mirror which was probably the original intent. It's a murky hit-and-miss proposition. I don't know about the Philip K. Dick part. His name is useful for selling this. It has some good sci-fi ideas. I like the darker tones but the lighter tones is awkward at times.",/review/rw3808034/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2017,citadeluk,7," Almost great
",Philip K Dick's stories have been shown by films like Bladerunner and Minority Report to be brilliant source material to make great screen adaptations. Black Mirror has shown how great a science fiction anthology series can be. The first two episodes of Philip K Dick's Electric Dreams hint at how great the series could be. ,/review/rw3808034/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2021,kosmasp,9," (Sweet) Dreams are made of these
","You and I might disagree ... but then again we all have our own taste, our own beliefs and our own want. In this case you get served a lot of Science Fiction mixed with Horror and thriller and some action to boost with too. The show could have gone longer if you ask me - a shame it only made it to 10 initial episodes - but with what a cast? Incredible people in front of the camera to say the least.",/review/rw3808034/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2018,youwishyouwerefunny,9," Interesting stories, very well shot, great cast
","I'm going into this without much knowledge of Philip K Dick and the whole Black Mirrors series (and really enjoying it). I have to say I really like this show. It has interesting stories, some could probably use a little more than 50 minutes to get a better grasp at the characters and the story to really make an impact. But with how they are, they are well done. The cast is amazing, full of well known actors and actresses. The episodes were beautifully shot, so from an aesthetic stand point, it was nice to watch. The stores are interesting sci-fi, leaving me with something to think about, rather than just thinking ""well that's pretty cool."" I think if you go into this not comparing it to Black Mirrors, you will enjoy it. If you compare, you will more than likely be disappointed, well, because it's not Black Mirrors. Both shows, in my opinion, are very well done, so I won't say one is better than the other. If you love sci-fi and the Twilight Zone feel, you will like this.",/review/rw3808034/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2018,gattonemichael,9," Fantastic Sci-Fi but don't expect Black Mirror-esque twists...
","Each episode is it's own sci-fi feature, and they are all acted and shot consistently and incredibly. Out of the 10 episodes, four of them for me are remembered as average plots with interesting premises (2,3,4,10), still great television but not incredibly memorable. Each of the other 6 episodes was grade A television. So good that I went to see what people had to say about it on IMDb, and then had to write a review because this show is not getting anywhere near enough credit. I think because Black Mirror, which actually got me to watch this show, has spoiled us with fantastically creative twist endings and foreshadowing. Electric Dreams is not about twist endings, its about the story itself. DON'T EXPECT TWIST ENDINGS. Just enjoy the ride through some excellent adaptations of ingenious short stories.

29 October 2017,chazwyman,," Philip K WHO?
","I've enjoyed the whole series of stories. Well acted, great sets, great effects, good design. I have also enjoyed reading the works of P K Dick. The short stories are excellent and introduced many of the key ideas upon which all sci-fi was based. However watching the shows and reading the stories are two different things.",/review/rw3808034/?ref_=tt_urv

I have seen the first three episodes and I have loved every single one. this is what Mr dick was about. weird / strange/ and (insert own ) The acting has been great. the story telling has been great.

28 September 2017,pontram,," It Needs More to Fascinate
","The first episode reminded me, like others here, of Brazil, mostly because of the female main character, who has a (not so small) resemblance to 'Jill'. The story is quite interesting, though the topic itself is somewhat outworn. But there simply isn't enough time (or too slow pacing) to convincingly elaborate a multifarious story and setting, it's only a snapshot of a world where oppressed and demeaned ""telepaths"" (called ""Tees"", would you believe that ?) are beginning to revolt, when the public anger against them and their abilities is also raising to dangerous levels, and when the government seems to be (deliberately ?) helpless.",/review/rw3808034/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2022,RogerBorg,5," A disappointing (ab)use of people and property
","Given the big name cast and guest writers here, you'd be right to expect more from this series than it delivers. But like Black Mirror - and the comparisons are obvious - casting big names is no guarantee of big quality.",/review/rw3808034/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2017,Lejink,7," Losing my mind

7 May 2018,bazookamouth-221-898097,6," Expected something better
","Out of the 10 episodes only 2 episodes were actually interesting to me, Episode 3 The Commuter (Timothy Spall) and Episode 4 Crazy Diamond (Steve Buscemi) much due to the actors mentioned in the episodes. As the series progressed it got worse and worse.Some episodes were really boring, some didn't make much sense. Bryan Cranston couldn't save Episode 6 which is a similar to Episode 7 with a much aged Greg Kinnear just different venues. Nothing close to Black Mirror this series. Some episodes seemed like 1 hour 30 minutes rather than 45 minutes. Really disappointing series.",/review/rw3808034/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2020,collectorofsorts,5," Mediocrity Best Describes This Series!
","I just found this series online a couple weeks ago. I've watched about half of the episodes so far and they're mediocre at best. Bland writing, bland acting, bland everything. It was a short series and one of the few of this type that I didn't binge watch. But, it's just something to watch when there absolutely isn't anything better on to watch.",/review/rw3808034/?ref_=tt_urv

9 April 2018,SeriousMayhem,5," No dreams worth remembering
","You can't help but to compare this show to for instance the Twilight Zone or Black Mirror (and yes, you definitely can compare them). But where a show like Black Mirror mostly succeeds, Electric Dreams mostly fails in its execution. ",/review/rw3808034/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2017,marinovotsofia,5," A Greatish beginning/bad representation/good production
","Great atmosphere & good acting. The only regrettable thing is that they could have chosen a much more interesting short story to film but anyway it's certainly not regrettable that this picture exists. I can't believe the review where the person says PKD is a so-so author. I guess either he is lobotomized or just likes space soaps. Waiting for the next episodes! Edit: I had to remove 5 stars after my initial euphoria not because the series is bad but because it is badly represented. this is not Philip dick. in most episodes so far the interpretation wildly misses the point of the source material and is often transformed beyond recognition. the production is great actors, plots etc and i would give it a high rating if it didn't parade with the name of Philip dick. it's like saying the matrix or dark city is based on Philip dick sure they resemble his style and philosophy but it is not something he has written. still the series is worth watching if you know this from the start: not ""Philip k. dick's electric dreams"" but ""electric dreams inspired by Philip dick""",/review/rw3808034/?ref_=tt_urv

","There can be no denying that on first look this episode of Electric Dreams borrows heavily from the likes of Blade Runner, Black Mirror, Children of Men... etc, but of course the source material for this provides inspiration for the aforementioned titles, and so it's get an originality pass in my book.

","I'm not familiar with Philip K Dick stories so I can't comment on that. But if I compare this series to awful dark 4th season od Black mirror I can say that I'm enjoying myself much more watching PKD Electric Dreams. It's futuristic and diverse. Maybe a bit more drama then BM. Can't complain with casting Steve Buscemi, Bryan Cranston or Anna Paquin.",/review/rw3808034/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2018,jwrdavis,9," Excellent series for grown ups, not infantile sci fi types.
","Given the low standards of TV sci fi in recent years, a new series gives us hope and Electric Dreams gives us that in bucket loads. I loved it, ignore the people that didn't get it, they are great one piece sci fi dramas, I suspect the reason some disliked it was the lack of American accents. Comparing to Black Mirror is just silly, BM being of such a high standard, but compare to any other sci fi series you can name and this is well aboce all of those star trek spin offs. This is Sci Fi for grown ups, kids stay away, and adults who prefer kids TV likewise.",/review/rw3808034/?ref_=tt_urv
