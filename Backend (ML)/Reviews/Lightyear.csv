25 December 2013,kosmasp,7," It should have ended with Season 2
","If I were to rate the seasons individually, the first two seasons would have gotten a much higher rating. I really liked those, the suspense was held high, there was something at stake there. It really loses its grip (on almost everything) with the end of season 2, to make way for the third season. While watching Season 3, I realized this was more or less a rehash of the first season (though not as good). Still compared to what they went and did in Season 4 ... Season 3 seems like Shakespeare compared to it.",/review/rw8392041/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,9," This was such a great show!
",Prison Break is a heart pounding thriller that will keep you captivated throughout its entire run. The show is really smartly written where all of the cast and characters are given a chance to shine and they do...the entire cast is terrific! But the standouts are def the two stars of the show...Wentworth Miller and Dominic Purcell who play brothers Michael and Lincoln almost perfectly! I just recently started watching this show again since I haven't seen it since it was originally on back in 2005 and I can say it still holds up and is just as good as when it was on back then. If you haven't seen this yet then do yourself a favor and watch it as soon as you can.,/review/rw8392041/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2005,Stibbert,," Fast, thrilling and good looking!
","Prison Break is one of the best new series. It's got personality, style, thrills and action. Michael Scofield robs a bank only to be caught and jailed. With him behind the bars he brings a plan to get himself and his brother, who is sentenced to death, out. What few people knows is that Michael is the architect of the prison and so he knows his way around.",/review/rw8392041/?ref_=tt_urv

There he intends to break him and his brother Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) out who is on death row for the murder of the Vice President's brother.

11 January 2020,danieldwilkinson,10," addicting!
","Man i got addicted to this after the first episode!. The loyalty between the characters was pure amazingness. mahon had a memorable character development and one quote in here i will never forget between him and lincoln which was ""mahon remember what i said to you when this all started?"" ""yeah, you said after this is all said and done were gonna settle up"" ""consider us settled"" that moment made me tear up a bit.",/review/rw8392041/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Edge of your seat thriller!
","Prison Break is a story about two brothers. One is Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) who's on Death Row for a crime he didn't commit. His genius brother Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) holds up a bank to get himself out in jail with his brother. He has a plan to break them out, and a host of other interesting characters. Once out it's not over as they have to evade capture as they try to take down a political conspiracy. It's a heart pounding thriller that will keep you captivated throughout its entire run. The show is really smartly written where all of the cast and characters are given a chance to shine and they do...the entire cast is terrific! The first season is obviously the best but the others are still very well done and definitely worth watching. Don't miss this show!",/review/rw8392041/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,kylebrown0209,8," Awesome Tacular
",The show is a mixed bag Action packed and mysterious And at times it can serious and real my favorite part of it are Michael and Lincoln and how far would you go I'm sad that they're not gonna be making another season but I understand.,/review/rw8392041/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2005,SonicStuart,," This looks like a show that will be a hit!
","I have been seeing so many advertisements for this show and I decided to check it out and it's surprisingly good! The acting is well done and everything else. The show is about a guy named Lincoln (Dominic Purcell) who gets arrested and framed for a crime that he didn't commit and now his brother, Michael (Wennworth Miller) installs himself in prison for one reason, to get his brother out of jail! FOX had better not cancel this one! Because I'm tired of the FOX network canceling all these other good shows that have potential and they put them on nights where they can't win and they have way too many reality shows! Plus all the good shows that FOX cancels last for 1 or 2 seasons like ""Tru Calling"", ""Dark Angel"", ""Fastlane"" just to name a few. But hopefully this show might last with all the good reviews from all the newspapers and magazines. ",/review/rw8392041/?ref_=tt_urv

",Prison break I just watched all seasons and binged watched it as it was really good. There were 5 season in the series and truthfully they should have stopped it at season 4. Season 5 was not needed at all and if you watched the season 4 finale you would understand why. The characters were great in the show and each one of the main and side character's had a good storyline and great character development over the seasons. As I watched each season it definitely felt like you wanted to jump out of your seat at some points but unfortunately for me I was spoiled a lot of scenes because it was all over my Instagram and TikTok. That's how I saw it and wanted to watch it but overall good show 7/10.,/review/rw8392041/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2012,ivo-cobra8,10," Prison Break Season 2 DVD the best!
","Prison Break is the best best TV show on earth. Season 1 - 3 I have been watching over and over again. As you know I am a big fan of Prison Break! & and Season 1 - 3 were at it's best! I am in love with that show it is still the best one at it is. We are 2012 now three years ago Prison Break end it and i still adore it and love it so much. My favorite best Season is the Second Season of the show. I still don't know why some fans are criticizing saying that is not as good as The First and the Third Season? I don't get it, i think i have different taste than other people have. Season 2 is the best one and awesome ever it really is. I have Season 2 & 3 on DVD complete original DVD's all are original i really worked hard to get them. Story's: Season 1: Most men would do anything to get out of Fox River Penitentiary, but Michael Scofield will do anything to get in. His brother Lincoln has been sentenced to die for a crime he did not commit, and the only way to save him is from the inside out. Armed with prison blueprints and an impossibly intricate escape plan, Michael gets himself incarcerated, and the race against time is on. Now, he'll need all of the cunning, daring, and luck he can muster... along with the assistance of some of the prison's most vile and dangerous felons... - The story revolves around two brothers: one who has been sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit and his younger sibling, a genius who devises an elaborate plan to help him escape prison. The brothers, along with six other prisoners at Fox River State Penitentiary, manage to escape at the end of season 1. In Season 1 i love episodes the most: Go, Pilot, Riots, Drills and the Devil (Part 2), English, Fitz or Percy, Cute Poison. Season One was good intense drama but just too much Drama for me i expect more.",/review/rw8392041/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2005,aly-5,," Great Show
","Excellent acting and well written. One of those shows that you can't wait until the next episode and even more credible than ""24"" which, I have to say, this past year got a little out there. It's great and well worth your time.",/review/rw8392041/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2019,shashankpatel-37369,9," Masterclass !!!!
","A perfectly plotted series showing turn after turn and greatly it's almost unpredictable. Acting of every character is mind blowing. Detailed execution, covering the next move, thinking beyond imagination of the writers, made it one of the best ever atleast for me. Just one drawback was that after 3rd series it seem little stratched somewhere. Rest all, high five.",/review/rw8392041/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2023,florianamiceli,8," It's amazing movie. I love it
",Prison Break tells the story of a young man who wants to save his brother from the death penalty for a crime he didn't commit. It's not based on a book but on a true story. The story of Donald and Robert Hughes it's not the same story but it's similar. Prison break was filmed in a real prison. The film is set in Joliet correctional center in Illinois in Augustus 2005. I love the acting in this movie and I think it's an ideal film for poeple who like the plot. Wentworth Miller stars as Scofield and he plays the main role with his brother Lincoln. My favourite character is definitely Michael because he's incredebly clever and brave. He was ready to do everything for his brother. His bravery is an example for everyone.,/review/rw8392041/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,maryplier,10," Will always have a special place in my heart
","Prison break was airing when I was around the last year of elementary school/ first year of middle school.. It will always make those who watched it when it came out very nostalgic. I am not American, I watched it dubbed in french with my cousins. I miss those times were the family would all gather in front of the tv to watch a series after waiting for a whole week for that episode. We also bought the DVDs for the 2nd season.. I was probably not supposed to watch it at that age but no one cared anyways. Everyone at school was talking about it. Posters and interviews of its stars were ALL OVER teen/ starts magazines. I miss those times. I did rewatch it again few years later. But seeing this series will always remind me of the good old days anyways. (I did not watch seasons 3/4/5. I loved the series too much so I didn't want to ruin it for myself)",/review/rw8392041/?ref_=tt_urv
