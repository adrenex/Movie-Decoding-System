9 March 2006,ccthemovieman-1,9," In A Word: Intense
","Boy, here's an intense film, a survival-in-the-wilderness adventure/thriller starring the unlikely duo of Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin. It's not hard to guess who's the villain, in addition to a man-eating bear who stalks the two of them after their plane crashes in the woods of Alaska.",/review/rw1594369/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2013,slhma10,10," One of the most under-rated movies made
","I first saw this movie in 97 when it first came out.I had barely heard of Baldwin,Hopkins or Perrineau.It turned out to be one of those movies I sat on the ""edge"" of my seat and was stunned by the ending.I sat there,mouth agape.I found I had a deep respect for all three actors.This movie,in every discernible way,is a masterpiece.The cinematography is breathtaking.The musical score is one of the most beautiful themes I have ever heard.The plot is smooth and the acting superb.I had heard of Baldwin but had not thought he was a great actor until seeing The Edge.Hopkins has made some great movies but this one..well it my personal favorite.The subtleties are numerous,the suspense captivating and the message is profound.The bear is without a doubt frightening and primal.This movie evoked emotions in me that were also primal.And the ending? It is the best ending to any movie I have ever seen.Perhaps you might have to appreciate the complexities of human nature as well as the action sequences in The Edge to get the most out of the viewing experience.It truly is the best of both worlds.",/review/rw1594369/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2000,claudonio,10," Terrific Action Adventure
","""The Edge"" is a terrific movie, not just as an action movie but as whole. I went to see this film because I thought it looked interesting, my expectations were shattered, this is a well written, well acted, well directed thriller. Anthony Hopkins as always turns in a great performance but the big suprise is Alec Baldwin who did just as well. This film has some of the best dialogue ever written for a movie of this type, and the action scenes are clever and blazingly paced. This is a terrific movie.",/review/rw1594369/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 1999,Willie-12,8," one of the best of 1997
","The Edge is a powerful motion picture that satisfies in every way.  First of all, it delivers as an action/adventure film (which is what it is) by giving the audience some heart stopping sequences, and it never slows down.  The Edge also delivers as a dramatic film, with an ending that is painfully sad, yet satisfying.  This is one fine movie, and the performances by Hopkins (one of my favorite actors today) and Baldwin are superb.  They portray their characters with an honesty, and with a realistic nature that only great actors can accomplish.  As the plot twists and the pace picks up, you start to become so involved that you forget time is passing by. I strongly suggest this one to action lovers and to anyone who enjoys a good story.",/review/rw1594369/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2003,barnabyrudge,," Reasonably good, exciting survival thriller.
","The Edge is not interesting just because it's a well made survival thriller. The behind the scenes events on the film are pretty interesting too, especially the fact that it was filmed in such difficult conditions that star Hopkins developed life threatening pneumonia midway through the production.",/review/rw1594369/?ref_=tt_urv

13 March 1999,tony's,," What One Man Can Do, Another Can Do
","The Edge is an original movie.  There have been movies with stranded people, fighting for survival and movies with jealous lovers trying to kill the rich spouse, but how often has there been such an adventurous story combining them both?  It seems Hopkins has befriended Bart the Bear with multiple appearances with the new star.  The scenery in Alaska is magnificent.  It's almost as if the viewer is there on the plane.  I wonder if Charles Morse did start a new life.",/review/rw1594369/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2016,fullbug,10," Way Better Than Jaws
","Some reviews refer to this movie as ""Jaws With Claws"". Perhaps, but the breath taking cinematography and numerous sub plots make this a way better movie. The negative and mediocre reviews (I believe) are the result of armchair survivalists and those that are so saturated with city folk movies that they are practically in culture shock when watching something like this.",/review/rw1594369/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2001,msinabottle,10," A Morality Play in an Immoral Age
","A very strong performance by Anthony Hopkins, Bart the Bear, and Alec  Baldwin, in that order, in a film that deals with the important  subjects of virtue, wisdom, and morality. I can understand why some of  the modern audience might find that to be a turn-off.  The sets and locations alone are worth a rental, especially of the DVD,  the haunting Goldsmith score lingers in the memory and enhances the  viewer's pleasure in the film. What a joy it is to see a film that is  tautly and expertly written, that tells the salient details of the plot  but leaves you guessing--through repeated viewings--of the whys, wheres  and whens of the development.  If you favor serious drama--if you relish philosophy--if you don't need  a film spoon fed to you or so puerile that they try to stun you with  explosions--you will enjoy The Edge.  My choice of a collegiate vocabulary in this review is deliberate.",/review/rw1594369/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2010,d-maxsted,10," Should Have Won Best Picture
","This is the motion picture that should have nabbed the best picture award of 1997...far from it for me to say it just stands out amounst so many others but the stunning performances from both Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin...and for me Alec Baldwins performance in this movie is just remarkable,to this day I still find it hard to believe that Alec was overlooked at the Oscars. Of course let us not forget the performance by the amazing Bart The Bear,recently after learning that he had passed away some years ago I watched a documentary about him and his owners/trainers said that when the camera's rolled it was almost as if Bart knew he was on camera and in The Edge you can certainly tell..he gives in my opinion some of the most god-damn scary looks given by a Kodiak Bear you'll ever see on the big screen..watching the final showdown between bear and man its enough to give you goose bumps..Bart is right there with the actors,swinging his oh so massive claws inches away from both Hopkins and Baldwin and giving the performance I think all who knew him and his work will remember him for..again its a shame there isn't an Oscar for best animal performer. A brilliant movie from start to finish,,not so much a movie but an experience",/review/rw1594369/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2000,obiwancohen,10," Hopkins creates a fascinating character
","I had low expectations going into this movie, but after about ten minutes I was hooked.  The cinematography is lush, the music is warm and hearty and the script is fresh and furious.  At times, the film is slow, and it is during these moments that you realize the depth and emotion injected into these characters via Mamet's crystal-clear and poignant dialogue.  It touches on primal fears (territory, survival, fear, shame, love and jealousy) and it delivers moral commentary on all of the above.  Did I also mention that this movie is a thriller too?  Hopkins is at his best as the calm and thoughtful Charles Morse, billionaire and bored with his ivory tower lifestyle.  His counterpart, Mr. Baldwin is a slimy and petty fashion photographer, Bob Green.  The interaction between the two shows a middle-ground that is brilliant in contrast.  Hopkins is a father figure to Baldwin's brash young frenzied Bob.  The competition between the two to survive, and ultimately return to civilization (and Charles' wife), sets the stage for a complex and thoughful character drama.  Bart the Bear is a star indeed, and while this movie is marketed for having ""Jaws with Claws,"" there is SO much more depth and detail to this movie.  This is easily in my top 10 films of all time.  It connected with me and I hope you enjoy it too.  10 out of 10!",/review/rw1594369/?ref_=tt_urv

24 June 2005,filmmakerck17,10," Misunderstood Masterpiece
","It's exceedingly easy to see how some people might not like this film. The most frequent reason in my opinion is that some just don't 'get it'. While busy focusing on pointing out rather trivial and nit-picky things, they are so far off the central point and weight of what the film is truly offering that the most rewarding aspects are lost on them.",/review/rw1594369/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2021,gpeltz,8," Moral Turpitude
","The Edge (1997) Directed by Lee Tamahori. This was in all ways, a top notch production. Excellent acting all around. Anthony Hopkins giving a thoughtful performance, and Alec Baldwin keeping pace. Beautiful location shooting. Excellent Jerry Goldsmith score and a plot that probes both strenuous physical and mental challenges. The Bear was as fierce and terrifying as anything since Jaws (1975) and would not be outdone until 2015's CGI's Killer Bear. in The Revenant. The Edge here is using intelligence as a major survival tool. I like the way the movie unfolds, when one threat is overcome, a shift in focus reveals new perils. I liked this picture because it had a positive lead with a strong set of moral values. And oh my, is he put through the test. Tense, engrossing and easy on the eye this is a top notch experience.Eight Stars out of Ten for this wilderness adventure",/review/rw1594369/?ref_=tt_urv

","Anthony Hopkins is one of my favorite actors, so I had to see this film. Sure enough, I wasn't disappointed. Although the film got mixed reviews (and I could understand why, in a way), I was able to enjoy the experience of watching it. The cinematography was stunning. For that alone I recommend this film.

22 December 2005,herlenwein-1,10," A real sharp edge
","A truly superb film. A story of survival. Not of the fittest but of the most dedicated and resourceful. Essentially a two character interplay, Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin are perfectly cast with intense portrayals of their characters. The supporting cast is minimal but makes for a tasty side dish with Harold Perrineau, Elle Macpherson, and veteran actor L.Q. Jones as a venerable weathered sly fox. Written by David Mamet, whose magnificent style is evident throughout, and directed by Lee Tamahori the film delivers a unique array of action, dialogue. and symbolism. Added also is a magnifcent and haunting score by Jerry Goldsmith. Tribute must also be given to Bart the bear, his trainer. and the Animatronic bear which provided some terrific action sequences. A shame this film did not garner any awards. Recommended highly.",/review/rw1594369/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 1999,LebowskiT1000,10," Spectacular
","I absolutely loved this movie.  Anthony Hopkins, Alec Baldwin and Harold Perrineau did an excellent job.  I was thoroughly impressed.  I loved the interaction between the characters and most of all, I loved Bart The Bear. Bart was spectacular, he did an excellent job.  Bart doesn't get the credit he deserves.  The film was an excellent ""What if...""  All around great movie, a must see.",/review/rw1594369/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2006,Quinoa1984,7," David Mamet, who knew?
","I wouldn't say this is one of the writer David Mamet's best written works (in truth I didn't know he wrote it until looking it up here), and it doesn't make director Lee Tamahori a really top-notch studio filmmaker. That being said, when it was shown on television the other day I couldn't turn away from the TV. It is, without a doubt, just an entertaining survival story with a few really good actors in the midst of the wilderness. On top of this there is also the factor of the bear in the film, played by the late Bart the bear (of The Bear and the Great Outdoors, oddly enough to be referring to an animal as if he were a real acting talent), who is if nothing else a terrifying amalgam of the dangers of the wild. It's almost not that important to know much about the background about the characters, but Mamet even gives a little bit of edge, no pun intended, with the animosity of Baldwin at Hopkins. It's with this unnerving background that Mamet does his best to portray this struggle for survival. It's not quite the territory that suits him in some ways- the dialog, if compared to some of his other words, is lackluster to me- despite him doing his best to make it original. And what else could be asked for than to keep your eyes tuned to the screen, which is the wisdom in casting Hopkins as the rich old white guy who knows-most-if-not-all and Baldwin as the contemptitive and scared s***less other guy (and lest not forget Harold Perrenieu in a good supporting role). To put it another way, if you like movies dealing with man against nature, this is one not to miss. However if you're just a general fan of the actors or just getting into Mamet it's not a high priority. It's at the core a sturdy enough picture, and it also provides some keen Bart the bear stunts. 7.5/10",/review/rw1594369/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2007,fimimix,10," ..predcitable, but great...
","What a treat to see an action-movie without a lot of gunshots and/or explosions !, but one with some intelligent portrayals of the human psyche. Lee Tamahori's directing and David Mamet's script surely added-up to a tense tale. I thought it was a much more recent movie, but it certainly doesn't matter: every role was complete.",/review/rw1594369/?ref_=tt_urv
