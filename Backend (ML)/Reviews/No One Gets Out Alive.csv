21 July 2002,llihilloh,," This show is absolutely hilarious.
","I didn't start to watch ""That '70s show"" until about a year or so ago and I sure wish that I would have started tuning in a lot earlier.  This series is really funny, really different, and has an amazing cast.",/review/rw1851292/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2005,lee_eisenberg,," the '70s...those were the days
","I guess that one might say that ""That '70s Show"" is to the 1990s what ""Happy Days"" was to the 1970s: a look at how cool things were twenty years earlier in Wisconsin. And they do a great job with it. The characters are: Eric Foreman (Topher Grace), a sometimes clueless high school student; Donna Pinciotti (Laura Prepon), Eric's strong-willed friend; Michael Kelso (Ashton Kutcher), a complete imbecile; Jackie Burkhart (Mila Kunis), the vain, egotistical member of the group; Steven Hyde (Danny Masterson), the cynical member of the group; Fez (Wilmer Valderrama), a foreign exchange student who always tries to be cool; Red (Kurtwood Smith), Eric's hard-ass father; and Kitty (Debra Jo Rupp), Eric's jolly mother.",/review/rw1851292/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2008,Sandcooler,8," What eighth season?
","Over the years, we've seen a lot of preposterous things done by writers when the show just had to go on no matter what, keeping ""8 Simple Rules"" going after John Ritter died comes to mind, but this is probably the first time I cared. The idea of having ""That 70's Show"" without Eric or to a lesser extent Kelso is ridiculous. They tried to cover it up with a comeback of Leo and increasingly outrageous story lines, but it always felt like why bother when you don't have a main character anymore. It just didn't really connect, it was a bunch of unrelated stuff happening that most of the time wasn't even funny. The last season felt like the season too much for every single character, simply because Eric used to take a lot of screen time and now we'd be smashed in the face by how stale and repetitive the rest of the characters were. Focusing on the gimmick that is Fez was thoroughly uninteresting and the character would simply stop working, because the whole deal was that he'd say something weird from out of nowhere, and you can't say stuff from out of nowhere when every second line is yours. They also brought in the standard cousin Oliver, only this time it just wasn't a kid. Whenever you heard somebody knock on the door, you started praying it wasn't Randy, please let it not be Randy. The deal with Randy was that he'd do really awful jokes, usually as Red would say, smiling like an ass and totally screwing up delivery and Donna would be in stitches. I think more than half of the last season was Donna pretending to be amused. The problems had started earlier though: what once was a truly great show with an equally great concept that for once wasn't about a dysfunctional family slowly got into the territory of soap opera. Everybody started being in love with everybody, emotional scenes were dragged out at nausea, with just one usually lame joke placed somewhere to divert attention that we were watching ""As The World Turns"". I'm guessing this was character development, but come on that was written almost as clumsily as the moral lessons from ""Family Matters"". To be fair, the last episode, also because it had a cameo by Topher Grace (a cameo in his own show), was really good, even if not that funny either.",/review/rw1851292/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2004,gerard-21,," Consistently Funny
","Unlike the 70s sitcom it sometimes mocks (Happy Days), this show has no peaks and valleys, and never ""jumped the shark"". It's just a rock solid, funny show and has been for the duration of its run (so far). I have watched just about every episode since the beginning, and have never been let down. It's an extremely underrated show which could reach ledgendary status if it runs for a few more years. Everyone in the cast is very funny and endearing in their own way. The best thing is that they never stray from the original characterizations. And you never doubt for a minute that you're back in the seventies, unlike Happy Days, which was set in the 50s yet much of the cast (Scott Baio anyone?) sported contemporary haircuts. This show is a gem. Watch. You won't be disappointed.",/review/rw1851292/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2005,shanfloyd,," Funny indeed.
","This is a really funny show indeed. The script is good and never fails to deliver new ideas. After seven seasons, the show hasn't got boring and that credits must go to the writers. There are some very interesting and funny characters like Red Forman, Fez or regular guest characters like Leo. The actors are quite good, especially Danny Masterson or Wilmer Valderrama (he got a fabulous accent) or Debra Jo Rupp. At first Mila Kunis was really bad but she got better as the show advanced. It is good that the story advanced really well along these seasons. And I like the way they capture the '70s atmosphere, like through the references of the movies or music.",/review/rw1851292/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2010,AlsExGal,9," An awful decade to be young ...
","... and the series lets you forget all that. I am about three years older than the kids portrayed in the series. Born in 1958, I learned to drive during the first gas shortage, and got my first post-college graduation job during the second gas shortage in 1979. The 70's were a truly dreadful time to be young - inflation, competing for after-school minimum-wage jobs with laid-off thirty-somethings, dreadful music, worse clothes.",/review/rw1851292/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2000,JBoze313,," A winner for FOX
","This show is one of my favorites.  I just started watching it last week when Fox aired an episode every night of the week.  I cannot believe I've been missing this show!  It's one of the funniest shows I have seen in a long time.  Tho, I'm no fan of the 70's as a decade, the show makes me wanna go back and live it all again...wait I was born in 1978, so forget that idea.   Anyhow...the show follows the lives of a group of 17 year- olds in the 70's and everything they do is hilarious.  I love the character of Fez, who happens to be foreign, and he's sorta the dork of the show.  He tries to be cool and catch all the fads of the time, but he never seems to get it right, and he's always after Jackie, played by the beautiful Mila Kunis.  As for Jackie, the relationship between her and her boyfriend is classic.  The guy is a total idiot, and she's almost as dippy as he is...As for Eric, who is the male lead, and Donna- his girlfriend, they are so sweet together...if I do say so myself.  They are the perfect couple on the show, and I'm shocked they're acting, they do the couple thing so well!   The show is like a lot of comedies, but it's got an edge most shows don't. I love the shots where the camera rotates around the table, showing all the guys talking...it's a staple of almost every episode.  Check this show out if you haven't had a chance, or chose to ignore it!!",/review/rw1851292/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2005,dpoll390,9," Best sitcom, funniest sitcom, ever.
","This show has come so far. At first EVERYONE in the cast from Eric to Fez, they were all new actors and actresses, fresh faces, and just look what they accomplished. They stuck with the show and it was a success. Its one of the best shows ever made and its probably the funniest sitcom I've ever seen in my life. It will be sad to see it end but if they end this show, I hope to God that the series finale goes out with one of the biggest bangs that any season finale has ever had. I don't care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode. Go down swinging, get one last punch in. The show deserves it, the fans deserve it, if they go, let everyone know its going to end, like on Friends, and let the finale be huge. I say get Donna and Eric married, I say have Hyde and Kelso fight and become friends again, I say have something interesting happen between Fez and Jackie because Fez has been trying for so long, but of course it wont work out for him. JUST CLOSE OUT THE SERIES BIG TIME GUYS!",/review/rw1851292/?ref_=tt_urv

10 November 2002,stamper,," 70's Rock
","As the title suggests, this comedy takes place in the 70's (one of my favorite musical decades). It revolves around a group of friends which are all late teenagers and covers all of their daily hassles with friends, parents work and love. There is a variety of different and real characters here, plus the one that no comedy can work without it seems: the incredible dumb-ass. In this series this person is Kelso (Ashton Kutcher). Then there is Eric (Topher Grace), whose basement is the place where the main characters usually hang to avoid their parent and Erics sister. Eric is an OK guy, whose girlfriend Donna (Laura Pepron) lives in the same street as he does. The relationship between the two is very well worked out and they behave in a way I think is appropriate for serious couples of that age. The rest of the crew are Jackie (Mila Kunis) who is really self absorbed and not one of the favorite's of the group, although she belongs there. Then of course there's Fez (Wilmer Valderrama) the foreigner, who is thinks very highly of himself at times, but who is also naive and shy in a way. The crew is completed by my favorite character, Hyde (Danny Masterson). The reason I like him so much is that he is very easygoing. Plus he is extremely cool, I mean when he cracks a joke or makes a remark it always strikes a chord, whether it is a wise or a mean statement. Overall this is a good show with some great and some standard comedy characters (of which not all are mentioned here). ",/review/rw1851292/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2006,jasonk3-1,10," Most Underrated Sitcom
","This was one of the funniest and greatest sitcom to hit national television. Its unfortunate that the show is not placed amongst great sitcoms where it truly belongs. The actors did a superb job and seasons one thru six were the show at its peak point. Although season seven was not as great when compared to the previous six, it was still funny. Season 8 was the real problem kicked in. Without Topher grace or Ashton Kutcher the show simply fell apart. Not too say, the other actors weren't great if any of 2 main characters had left such as Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon ( Don Starks and tommy Chong are great too) left the show it would have the same affect. And the inclusion of Randy ( Josh Meyers) didn't help either because he was not well received by the shows fans. I believe if the show ended a year ago it would have certainly gone down in history as one of the sitcom greats. Season 8 was a little dull but the finale was excellent. I am going to miss the show, i just hope i wake up one day to find out the show is back as That 80's show with the same cast because i am going to miss the hell out of it.",/review/rw1851292/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2015,garycwoo,7," A beautiful series with an ugly ending
","I grew up watching That 70's show on nickelodeon and recently started watching the series again and I fell in love with the show again. The actors were incredible, the show was creative and the writing was amazing. This started to change from around series 4-5.",/review/rw1851292/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2015,gitrdonex4,6," Started Strong, Ended Weak
","Loved most of the cast and could relate to most. However the one consistent character/actor I couldn't stand was Donna/Laura Prepon. The combination of her bad acting and forced relationship with Eric annoyed me every episode. She would laugh at every line or would take things a little too seriously. They should've just fired her. Then there's Randy/ Josh Meyers. Ugh. I understand the writers trying to replace Eric's character but this was a bad idea. He was as funny as warm milk. He just goes to the Grooves shop, gets a job, and that's how he's introduced. He then started dating Donna, again another forced relationship. At this point of the show (Season 8), it should've just never existed. After the two main characters left, the studio clearly focused more on profits rather than just ending on a happy note. Eventually Hyde, Fez, Jackie, and Forman's parents were all that kept this show moving on to the bitter end. By Season 8, the main characters were either moving out , getting married, getting jobs, in other words, they grew up. The story went from kids growing up in the 70's to average middle class adults in the 70's. Once again, was great in the beginning, but once the two top characters left, they should've just cashed out.",/review/rw1851292/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2018,han-46275,8," My favorite show but not the last season
","Has anyone want to talk about Jackie and Hyde relationship? Season 8 really has poor writing. I know it sounds harsh but why they left hanging the Jackie and Hyde situation? They were such a perfect couple. Jackie made Hyde open up and be a better person. Jackie seems to be nicer when she's around him. Why they don't have ""the talk"" about their relationship after Hyde saw Jackie and Michael together. The last season really sucks because this show changed the writers at the last season. Plus, literally everyone in the last season left. 
I really like the other seasons though. Different kind of comedy, great friendships and Red Forman. Seriously never get tired of dumbasses and foot in your ass jokes.",/review/rw1851292/?ref_=tt_urv

6 March 2022,AfricanBro,9," Can't remake this
","I really love this show, it turned me into one of those ""things used to be better in the old days"" because they're no sitcoms like this anymore. One of my favorite things about it is back then, when something was funny, it was funny and they said it; no fear of being canceled off air or excoriated by a movement or rights group. It's also nice to see where so many actors careers began, and I love how every character in the show is likable and funny for different reasons and the chemistry they share. Despite it being really funny, behind all that humor was something you could relate to and become attached to the characters as well; it was Eric and Donna that hit me the most. When Eric told Donna ""if you can see a future without me in it and that doesn't break your heart then we're not doing what we thought we were doing here""; I'd seen that quote so many times before I actually watched the show and it hit so hard when I got to it because I didn't realize how attached I grew to the characters, it was all just a comedy sitcom to me.",/review/rw1851292/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2018,amexspam,6," Great 1st 3 Seasons
","My lord people, an 8.1 overall rating? The series began as an 8 or better as the actors embodied their characters and followed a coherent script path that progressed through later teenage years. Seasons 4 & 5 worked as the developments of the 1st 3 seasons were expanded and explored. The quality then began to decline so precipitously that two of the main cast members fled. This was a typical series that stayed on 3 years longer than it should have, but unlike many, was truly magical in the 1st seasons.",/review/rw1851292/?ref_=tt_urv
