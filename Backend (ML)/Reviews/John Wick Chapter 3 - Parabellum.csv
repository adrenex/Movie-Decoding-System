","Following 3 doctors in NHS, and their busy lives, handling work and children husbands, sadness and happiness, got me hooked from the start. Very well acted.",/review/rw8855039/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2023,wwandwrs,10," ER & CALL THE MIDWIFE HAD A BABY
","I've waited years for a series to be this well done. It made me feel every emotion a human can feel and even the story lines I could never relate to or understand on a personal level had me watching with emotion. As my tagline reads ER & Call the Midwife had a baby because this series is set inside a hospital and you do get to see a baby being born, maybe more than one but it includes other medical areas so you're not sat there for a straight hour watching deliveries, it also does so well peeping into the characters personal lives. I'm hoping to see a several year series out of this one because I've waited years for a drama this good.",/review/rw8855039/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2023,elliotpittom,9," Fantastic - hit the mark!
","I can understand the points about bad acting here - the parts were cast brilliantly. Yes, it's not groundbreaking and it might not be absolutely true to life but there are certainly elements that are relatable. The storylines are shocking and hard hitting. I can't see anything else they could add here - except a longer series as some parts did feel quite rushed and some stories could have potentially had more detail added to them. That's more to the shows credit, than it's demise though. All in all, this is a great show and I do hope they bring it back for another series (or many more in the future).",/review/rw8855039/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2023,chickwah,8," Loved this!
","I started out intending to watch just the first episode and ended up watching them all because it was so compelling! All 3 of the female leads were excellent in this brilliantly written series, but it was altogether a strong cast. Having worked in a hospital for some years, I found it to be very true to life and believable, giving true insight into the pressures the NHS staff are under. Well done to all concerned and I really hope there will be another series because we need to see more drama like this.",/review/rw8855039/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,kmfrrzm,10," itv really pulled one out of the bag
","It is rare to find a show with a protagonist who's actions stay consistent with their character throughout, and it's even rarer to find a show with three consistent protagonists, often one or two characters fall to the way side. Maternal delivers on this mark without flinching.",/review/rw8855039/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,irnbru-333,5," Lightweight hospital soap
",Three Doctors return to work after maternity leave and we follow their experiences. I was hoping for something a bit more realistic in the vein of the BBC's 'This is going to hurt.',/review/rw8855039/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2023,carolinesarre,1," Badly slung together
","Bad acting , bad filming, not sure if it is supposed to be a comedy or drama... won't be watching episodes. BRING BACK HOLBY !!",/review/rw8855039/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2023,rachellowe-26123,9," Fabulous - now let's just have a bit more reality
","I absolutely loved this series and couldn't stop watching. We so need more series like this - It had brilliant story lines and a superb cast whom you couldn't stop watching. As a woman who had experienced the realities and sacrifices of working in an industry run be men (albeit not a medical one) there was so much they got right. Women being expected to take on far more than their fair share of both work and child care with a smile on their faces, the camaraderie amongst women who have each others backs and the reality of the NHS being on its knees. Unfortunately there was a fair bit wrong too (which made me a little surprised it was written by a woman). The fact that all male characters (even the gay one!) are chauvinists or losers was a big one, and the fact that despite all the shortages the wards look pristine.",/review/rw8855039/?ref_=tt_urv
