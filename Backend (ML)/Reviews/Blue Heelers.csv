14 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Sicario
","Sicario was first released back in 2015. I just watched it for the first time last week...and I really have no excuse other than I'm an idiot. I knew I'd like it, I'd heard nothing but amazing things, and five minutes into the movie I completely regretted not watching it sooner. Sicario is, hands down, one of the best action/thrillers of the decade. Director Denis Villeneuve manages to create so much suspense and intensity throughout 120 minutes that at times it's almost unbearable. Needless to say, my fingernails did not survive this movie. The plot itself is fairly basic - the FBI teams up with some shady people to fight a brutal Mexican drug cartel. Emily Blunt plays the young FBI agent recruited into the fight, and for most of the movie the audience is just as confused and suspicious as she is. It delivers plenty of wonderful ""what the hell?"" moments, as you never really get a sense of anyone's true motivations until the end. The performances are universally terrific and the dialogue is sharp, but the main reason the movie works so masterfully is Villeneuve. With the help of some striking cinematography and a brilliant score, he gives us one of the most surprising, tense, and atmospheric thrillers in the history of the genre. If you've never seen Sicario, please don't make my mistake and see it ASAP.",/review/rw3410693/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2016,Fella_shibby,9," The Deeper You Go, The Darker It Gets. ..
","Probably the best cinematography of this whole year. Roger Deakins is an absolute maestro. Music and sound combo of the movie added to the tension. Johann Johannsson's score is another exciting driving force upon which the film is carried. It was powerful. Incredible action-thriller. It was extremely dark. Not color wise, but the subject matter. Villeneuve really knows how to take the most vile subjects and turn them into intense n dark cinema. The acting was top notch especially Del Toro. He is comfortable with this sort of material and it really shows. I hav always been a fan of Brolin after no country for old men. His character was so relaxed n mean with those slip ons quiet opposite to del toro's who u slowly get to know as the movie unfolds. Del toro's character was emotionless and relentless. It is his best performance to date. The only scene i couldn't digest was the dinner scene. I turned my eyes n was shocked for few mins.",/review/rw3410693/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2017,TheLittleSongbird,10," Crosses the tour-De-force border of film-making
","'Sicario' had me stoked from the start. It is hard to go wrong with the involvement of cinematographer Roger Deakins, director Denis Villeneuve, writer Taylor Sheridan, advertising that really makes one want to see the film, its critical acclaim and a cast like Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro.",/review/rw3410693/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2015,Giacomo_De_Bello,8," 8/10
","One of those select few thrillers that will have your eyes stuck to the screen from the opening credits to the very end, and I mean that literally: I changed my sitting position many times during the film, yet I clearly recall never ever turning my head away from the film, this is how intense it is.",/review/rw3410693/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2015,subxerogravity,8," Well organized story with great characters, performed by great actors
","This is like the stuff you see on hour long serialized Television like Netflix's Narcos, but instead this police like drama is done in a two hour movie instead of thirteenth episodes.",/review/rw3410693/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," Nearly a perfect film.
","Excellent directing by Villeneuve with perfect cinematography and score. The sunset tunnel approach scene should be made into a poster. The use of the filters from night vision to thermal vision was excellent. The casting and performances were exceptional and very convincing, especially del Toro, whom I feel was the cherry on top. Just his simple ""ssssssth"" during the choking rescue scene is enough to make your hair stand on end. The writing had some plot and technical issues, and needed more clarity in some scenes. But the non-stop tension, suspense and scenes that will make you gasp with disbelief, along with the perfect pacing and 121 min runtime, makes you overlook those little flaws. It just all feels so real. An astonishing film that will impress even if this isn't your genre.",/review/rw3410693/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2015,Ramascreen,10," One of this year's best thrillers
","More visceral than Steven Soderbergh's ""Traffic."" SICARIO is about the cost to pay in a drug war and its merciless brutality. Masterfully shot, perfectly acted. This is a film that doesn't allow you to feel comfortable. With each passing moment, it crawls its way deeper and deeper into this world where death is its only end game.",/review/rw3410693/?ref_=tt_urv

31 August 2016,classicsoncall,10," ""Now you'll learn what's hell in Yankee land"".
","It's hard to imagine that the world of ""Sicario"" actually exists in the nether world of Mexican drug cartels. You hear about the escalating number of deaths attached to the drug trade and it's quite simply unthinkable. The Mexican Government itself estimates the number of homicides due to drug trafficking between 2007 and 2014 is a staggering one hundred sixty four thousand! ",/review/rw3410693/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2015,ClaytonDavis,8," 'Sicario' Soars with Benicio del Toro and Emily Blunt in tow!
","Feverishly satisfying with pulse-pounding energy that's sure to give your heart its full day's work, Denis Villenueve's masterful ""Sicario"" with Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro, and Josh Brolin is an edge of your seat thriller that exemplifies the finest parts of the action genre. Filled with mystery, suspense, and outstanding performances, Villenueve's direction, along a tight script by Taylor Sheridan, brings a much needed sense of technique and art that's been sorely missing from the 2015 movie year.",/review/rw3410693/?ref_=tt_urv

5 October 2015,plpregent,7," Splendid in all technical aspects. Slightly flawed fundamentals prevent Sicario from reaching that next level.
","The wait is over. Since the trailer came out, I watched it several times a week. That's how hyped up I was. I finally got to watch Sicario, Denis Villeneuve's latest film. It got a very positive reception at the Cannes festival, and got tons of praise from movie critics worldwide.",/review/rw3410693/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2016,bob-the-movie-man,8," ""This is the land of wolves now"".
","Sicario ('Hitman' in Mexican) is well worth your viewing time. The ever- reliable Emily Blunt excels here as FBI agent and hostage specialist Kate Macer. After a gruesome discovery in Phoenix, Kate becomes an idealistic fish-out-of-water in a complex CIA mission, run by Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) against a notorious Mexican drug cartel. Key to the mission is Columbian-born Alejandro (Benicio del Toro): a man with a tragic past that directly guides his future.

","If you haven't read anything about the story or I reckon if it's not in the trailer, than the beginning of this movie will definitely feel like a punch in the gut, while you watch it. Even if you have it will have an impact of course, but it is even greater without knowing anything. And while it is silent (sort of), you will feel a great impact.",/review/rw3410693/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2015,Evanoil,8," Outstanding thriller
","Hard to find a thriller like Sicario these days , watch it! My thought is that a good Thriller title is the hardest case you can go for as a movie maker .A good thriller has to keep you hooked and in tense for the whole movie ,worst case for most of the movie.Sicario manages to provide the right amount of thrill and action in a way it keeps you interested through all of the time.Sure it had its flaws and sometimes i was a little disappointed with the decision the writers made with this one but when i look at the whole picture its coming up as a very good film , i honestly couldn't stop watching and was a little sad when it was over. I must say though that this movie has a political opinions in it that you cant overlook and it can be a little con for some viewers. Overall , this movie is truly a gem to Hollywood industry right now , very well written and directed plus it has outstanding cast.",/review/rw3410693/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2015,hamish-25851,9," Tense, intelligent drama, with thriller overtones
","The badlands of the US - Mexico border and the viciousness of the drug trade running across it sets the background and the tone for this movie. It's grim. Human life is very cheap and the movie doesn't flinch from showing consequences. There are definitely some scenes that are not for the faint hearted, but there is nothing gratuitous here. If anything - despite the subject matter - the film goes out of its way to avoid Hollywood heroics.",/review/rw3410693/?ref_=tt_urv
