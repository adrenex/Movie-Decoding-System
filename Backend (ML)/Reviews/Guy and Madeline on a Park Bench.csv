16 January 2008,Tillbradley,8," Great drama
","When I first read the plot of this drama i assumed it was going to be like Sex and the City, however this drama is nothing like it. The stories the characters seem more real and you empathise with the situations more. The concept of the drama is similar, four 30 something women guide us through there friendships and relationships with problems and strife along the way. Katie the GP is a dark and brooding character who you find difficult to relate too and is best friends with Trudi a widow. Trudi's character is heart warming as you can relate to difficulties she is having along with the fact she is the only mother of the four. Jessica is the party girl very single minded and knows what she wants and how to get it. She is a likable character and is closest to Siobhan the newly wed who whilst loving her husband completely can't help her eyes wandering to her work colleague. Over all the drama is surprisingly addictive and if the BBC continue to produce the series it could do well. It is unlike other female cast dramas such as Sex and the city, or Desperate Housewives. This if played right could be the next Cold feet. Plus the male cast are not bad on the eyes too.",/review/rw2026057/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2008,DVD_Connoisseur,," Glossy, gripping and provocative British drama
","""Mistresses"" is glossy, gripping and downright provocative drama from BBC1. With an extremely photogenic cast including the stunning Sarah Parish, the sexy Shelley Conn and the classy Orla Brady, this is compulsive viewing.",/review/rw2026057/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2009,Zen416,8," Gets you hooked...
","I wasn't quite sure if this was just going to be another one of those idiotic nighttime soap operas that seem to clutter prime time but, as it turns out, this is a pretty good show (no small thanks to talented casting). Four female friends with diverse backgrounds get together and share the weekly goings-on of their love-lives. The hour long program follows each of them separately through their often screwed up quests to find love and it does it without being boring or trite. Sharon Small's ""Trudi"" is the homemaker one (allegedly widowed after September 11th) who gets a little preachy and annoying with her friends (who tend to be a little looser and more creative in their endeavors). It's great to see Small back on t.v., as she was great in the ""Inspector Lynley Mysteries"". The chick can act. Orla Brady's character (Siobhan, a lawyer) is perhaps the most damaged but still very sympathetic of the women, as she wrestles with her kind but self-absorbed husband Hari (Jaffrey, formerly of ""Spooks"") in his driven desire to have a child with her, regardless of her needs. The final two members of the cast are the effervescent Jess (Shellie Conn), an events planner who's a wild child who sleeps with anyone and everyone, gender not specific, and Katie, (Sarah Parrish) a somber doctor who's affair with a patient AND his son have sent her career and love life spiraling out of control. That being said, I'm hooked now and hope that the BBC continues cranking this series out because it's good, it's different and it's got a great cast.",/review/rw2026057/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2008,madame-cleo,9," Witty, emotional, painful, seductive and provocative
","This drama is unlike Sex and the City, where the women have a few drinks and share their sexual encounters with each other. Its much more personal and people can relate to it. Its much more engaging and emotional on a new level than other dramas focusing on women and their lives like ""Sex and the City, Lipstick Jungle...."" ",/review/rw2026057/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2008,John-atte-Kiln,7," Bouquet of Barbed Wire reborn
","Why this is called ""Mistresses"" is a puzzle, because it's about four women, three of whom aren't mistressesÂ… Except, wait. Ah, I see. It's a salacious title and we all have to merchandise I suppose. The series itself? Delicious. Most of the characters are hell bent on cutting metaphorical chunks off themselves. Great fun. Reminds me of LWT's 1976 miniseries ""Bouquet of Barbed Wire"", where every character and their dads wielded the machete.",/review/rw2026057/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2010,ikanboy,5," Should be called ""SLUTS""
","This is a chick's only TV series. Many women will love it, most men will hate it. It's a soap, that pretends not to be, about 4 friends who have various ""shagging"" relationships. They get together and giggle about their different slants on men and sex. Occasionally they call each other out on the goings on, but their nails remain mostly sheathed.",/review/rw2026057/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2011,ysic2,10," Let there be a SEASON 4!!! PLEASE!!!!
","I am absolutely gutted that Mistresses TV show is no longer airing. I am in Australia and they are airing season 2 now. Unfortunately, if we didn't pay for pay TV, we miss out on a lot of British TV, however with more free channels coming, they put ""Mistresses"" on and I absolutely love it after watching one episode. I loved it so much that I have purchased the entire series of 3 Seasons (which is only 16 episodes) by the way. What! How can BBC ditch the show?? Shame! Shame! So so sad. Please bring it back. :-( I finally find a good show to watch that is not another cops and robbers or some silly, comedy show where the story lines are all the same but just different actors. ""Mistresses"" rocks!!",/review/rw2026057/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2009,monkey79,9," Series 2
",Series 2 has got off to a great start! I don't think you need to have watched series 1 to get a grasp of whats happening but like any series its nice to feel some sense of the characters and to care about what happens to them. And this show makes you think like that! These 4 30-something women seem to lead glamorous and exciting lives yet the premise is believable and realistic. So the twists and turns that arrive thanks to their love and sex lives are exciting to watch but you also know that these are problems that happen to real women too. Its about the decisions we make as women and how sometimes we are led down certain paths in our lives rather than consciously making those choices!,/review/rw2026057/?ref_=tt_urv
