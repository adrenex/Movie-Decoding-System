31 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,9," Elizabeth Olsen is amazing here!
",I found WandaVision to be a pretty entertaining show that's a fantastic addition to Phase 4! It's so over the top bananas but it works in a weirdly entertaining way! Once you start watching it you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible. I don't understand some of these negative reviews though...did you not watch the trailers? Some of you are acting surprised at what you were watching. I don't get it...what were you expecting that you didn't get to see? It's a wildly original show that's such a fun ride that you can't turn away and that absolutely pays off in the end. Elizabeth Olsen is so amazing here that she absolutely deserved an Emmy nomination! She was also just great and the best thing going in the new Dr. Strange movie!,/review/rw8451084/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Terrific!!
",WandaVision is the first of the Disney shows that take place in the MCU. I need to start off with my praise for Elizabeth Olsen and the job she does here. She's not only beautiful but she's such an underrated actress. She really is one of the better actresses working right now. Wanda is one of the most powerful superheroes in the entire MCU and it really shows here. It's a weird and very fun show that will keep you entertained throughout the series. The attention to detail really captured the era and is a fantastic tribute to to the sitcoms of that era. If you're a fan of the MCU then this is a must watch!,/review/rw8451084/?ref_=tt_urv

","The journey of a home life from Wanda Maximoff and Vision who have two twins, Billy and Tommy in Westview City with the appearance of a sitcom of various eras.",/review/rw8451084/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2021,evansjoshyr,10," Ignore every negative review before episode 4
","It might have been an error on Disney's part to release only the first 2 episodes at once instead of 4 episodes. While I am on of the few people who absolutely loved the intrigue and mystery of the first three episodes, this exceptional show has been getting a lot of hate due to a lack of plot.",/review/rw8451084/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2022,MsDJH,7," An unexpected experience
","First of, I'm not a Marvel fan, not into comics and superheroes at all, so please read this review as what it is: an outsider's point of view. I watched this show, because I saw the trailer and the obvious homage to classic television appealed to me. All those shows paid tribute to and mentioned, I like. The way the main character related to them affected me. The cast was great, the humor a lovely surprise. The villain, well, not exactly my cup of tea, but as I said, I have no background in this universe, so I won't go into further detail. What I loved beyond words was the attention to detail and the visible love expressed for TV history from The Dick van Dyke Show to Malcolm in the Middle. Now that hit a nerve and made me smile all the way through, love story included. I'm still positively enthralled.",/review/rw8451084/?ref_=tt_urv

","Avengers, Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany), are somehow starring in variations of old TV sitcoms.",/review/rw8451084/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2021,ThomDerd,8," Wandavision is kewl.
","Show is developing nicely and although the build up is slow, by episode 5 the story progresses more and gets interesting. World building seems good, characters are solid and there's an eerie vibe in every episode which makes it intriguing.",/review/rw8451084/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2022,tylerdburns-81322,8," Intriguing
","The thirty fifth entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, WandaVision is an emotional and mysterious television series. The casting is good, though the director of S. W. O. R. D. Comes across as a simple, one-dimensional character. Expanding upon that, the entire premise of S. W. O. R. D. Raises many questions, none of which are answered or alluded to. The villain reveal is clever and unexpected, I wasn't able to see it coming till near the end of the show. The return of Monica's character from Captain Marvel, combined with the post-credits scene have me excited for the future of the MCU, without even mentioning the future of Wanda's character. This show was definitely one of the more emotional entries into the MCU.",/review/rw8451084/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2021,naomimuldrew27,10," Gets better with every episode
",Writing this with bated breath waiting on episode 5. The whole premise of the show is just totally different and it works! So happy Randall Park is in it too. Its so smart and I'm so excited to see the rest.,/review/rw8451084/?ref_=tt_urv

25 November 2022,dr_bravestone,9," Fascinating, captivating, incredible
","Wandavision is a unique entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Marvel has arguably carved out its own sub-genre within superhero films, but with that has come a series of oft-repeated story beats which can cause some of these movies and shows to feel stale.",/review/rw8451084/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2021,TheTexasChainstoreManager,5," Interesting premise with a boring padding.
","WandaVision certainly have a very intriguing premise, but pretty much everything else, like the build up to the interesting parts, is a tacky snore. The first three episodes is pretty much just a homage to old sit-coms, but unfortunately they weren't able to make those parts ...you know ...funny. So they merely function as a boring transportation device to the mentioned interesting parts. Couldn't they hire some actual funny sit-com writers for those parts and make them good instead of necessities? Unfortunately when the intriguing more ""serious"" parts kicks ins, it feels like even those parts of the show gets stuck in some kind of stale combination. When you feel like ""Ah, here we go!"" it doesn't really go. Is it suppose to be funny still or more serious? Either way, it's not very good at being any of those things.",/review/rw8451084/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,FallenEye,8," Creates Deep Wonder, with a Magical Vision.
","Unlike all the MCU Disney+ entries, as in every single one, suffering from a buckling middle and a rushed end, this series in particular managed to carry the weight and load of gripping quality throughout, while also being an amazing piece of visual, story, and performance art, that exercises various dynamic techniques which eventually add levels of deeper, entertaining, visionary, and innovative dimensions to the overall production.",/review/rw8451084/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2021,planktonrules,8," Have a comic book geek on hand to help you fill in the blanks if you are a person like me.
","I am 56 years-old and not particularly in love with superhero movies. In fact, a few years ago, I pretty much gave up on watching them, as I just tired of the genre and the plethora of Marvel and DC films. That being said, I did enjoy the DIsney+ mini-seris ""WandaVision""...but it really helped to have an 'interpreter'...a geeky sort who has read comics and seen the films to help explain things to be now and again. For non-comic fans, it can be daunting watching the film and not having all the backstory...not knowing which characters are evil, which have been revived from the dead and which are not to be trusted. Fortunately, my daughter watched with me and helped me to understand. Too bad there aren't services that do this for all folks like me!",/review/rw8451084/?ref_=tt_urv

9 August 2022,joshuakuster,10," If stranger things came to marvel
",This is one of a kind tv show because it explores the time between the blip and a alternate reality when people slowly starts to see the gaps between world and shows how it is being controlled with amazing fights with Agatha. It also shows how strange things happen in west view from the pov of vision and towns people and how they don't know what is going on.,/review/rw8451084/?ref_=tt_urv

31 July 2022,toseale,7," A Wonky Ride
","An exciting and new take on Marvel, WandaVision is plenty fun. Starting off as confusing and odd, it progresses into a great show, with each episode having a different style in show history. The fans wanted House of M, they got something similar that they can be pleased with. Elizabeth Olsen has really developed a great character out of Wanda Maximoff, and seeing her evolution into the Scarlet Witch was honestly rewarding as a Marvel fan. Though they do make quite a few surprises, a couple characters were either pointless or upsetting. I hope Marvel makes amends to this in the future. This show is a wild, strange ride for sure, but worth it by the end.",/review/rw8451084/?ref_=tt_urv

",I don't know what to say about this series this is an amazing series this is like one of the best series I have ever watched in my entire life the plot was very unpredictable I was not able to predict anything at all I had no idea or what was going to happen in future and that made it very thrilling and the characters are amazing the back story of wanda is amazing like how they told her story that was really amazing I love the villain she was amazing she was very evil and overall she didn't lack any characters of being a villain. Wanda is a great hero and the way she control her emotions was really amazing.,/review/rw8451084/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2022,esterpinto-27292,10," Incredible
","Wandavision starts the sequence of marvel series incredibly. After lost her husband, Vision, that helps and stays with her for at least 5 years, Wanda freak out and starts using her magic in kind of a bad way and that is what the serie is about. The acting is a uncredible thing, Elisabeth Olsen is the perfect Wanda Maximoff, she acts like she really lot her husband and all of her friends. The scenes of her crying made every one feel for and with her. Unfortuly, the first episode is very confusing, what make a lot of people give up and jump for the next serie. But that is a huge mistake, because like I said, is an incredible and choging serie, besides the fact that it changes the couse of all the marve's series and movies that will come below.",/review/rw8451084/?ref_=tt_urv

","Marvel's advertising campaigns are always ready to please their viewers with preliminary content. There are a lot of videos and various materials coming out before each new studio project.

","This is a mini-series that I checked out since I'm still out to catch up on all the Marvel properties. I wasn't going to watch the shows as it just seemed to be too much. What changed my mind was that while feeding my daughter, who is a newborn, these are easy to put on and follow without taking up too more of my time.",/review/rw8451084/?ref_=tt_urv

",Any review less than 19 for this is a mistake. This show was amazing the different eras each episode made them all feel so fresh and this maternal side of Wanda is heart warming the ending will make you cry many tears as it breaks your heart and you truly feel for Wanda. The cgi is out of this world and the acting is wind blowing. Agatha harkness as the villain was a shocker and Wanda is truly at her strongest.,/review/rw8451084/?ref_=tt_urv
