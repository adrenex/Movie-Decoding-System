4 February 2022,boblipton,7," What Punishment? For What Crime?
","Forty years ago, members of the Weathermen robbed a bank in Michigan, killing a woman in the event. The people involved scattered into the wind. Now Susan Sarandon, has been arrested by the FBI for her part in the murder, and the police are looking for her accomplice, Robert Redford. For the past quarter of a century he has been keeping his head down as a lawyer in Albany, New York, raising his daughter, mourning the death of his wife. Plus he wasn't at the robbery, but the only person who can prove that is Julie Christie, and he has no idea where she is.",/review/rw2778049/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2013,soccercamp-1,7," Solid well made film with reliable actors
","Although not one of Redford's best, ""The Company You Keep"" is still way better than the majority of so called thriller/dramas produced these days in my humble opinion...excellent acting all round, Redford is good as usual (if looking a little too old maybe for this role) and the supporting cast (Cooper, Tucci, Christie and Gleeson in particular) are a credit as well. Whilst there are not a lot of twists and surprises that you can't see coming, it's the way the story is told and unfolds, and it makes you think about your ideals and sacrifices and plotted that really counts. Although I'm a Brit in my 40's and the material is not familiar to myself at all I really enjoyed the ride. Solid, if not spectacular, but definitely worth the time to view.",/review/rw2778049/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2013,JohnRayPeterson,7," Interesting character development. Stellar Cast
","If you are at all familiar with Robert Redford's recent productions, you may very well have noticed that he is, as director and producer, very much interested in character development within unique stories, whether he co-stars in the movie or not. He also has a knack at picking a good cast; such is the case here with Shia Labeouf, Susan Sarandon, Stanley Tucci, Chris Cooper, Terrence Howard, Nick Nolte, Brendan Gleeson and Julie Christie.",/review/rw2778049/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2013,beabt1,8," This movie deserves a better rating than the one it has received here.
","The acting by a stream of well known faces who were young I when I was also young are very good, and being a similar age as them I could relate to some of what they were experiencing in the story. I listened to a review on the radio criticising the movie because of the difficulty of enjoying watching people past their prime in a suspense movie. Maybe the reviewer should have stuck to the Bourne movies to get their kicks. ",/review/rw2778049/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2013,Emma_Stewart,8," Provocative throwback to another era
","The Company You Keep has a startlingly star-studded cast and I was surprised to see that most of them were in small, thankless roles. People like Sam Elliott, Nick Nolte, Chris Cooper and Stanley Tucci have a couple, three scenes at most and aren't given much of anything to sink their teeth into. What I think this suggests is an immense respect for Robert Redford - there are very few directors who could assemble actors of that caliber for roles that probably anyone could play. And that respect is merited - with Company, Redford proves once again that he is an exceptionally talented director who deserves to be taken more seriously than he is.

24 November 2013,paul2001sw-1,7," Tough questions, cuddly answers
","There's a lot to think about after watching Robert Redford's movie, 'The Company You Keep', although sadly, some of the ideas are provoked by their absence in the film, rather than their presence. The story is based on the real life activities of the Weather Underground, a radical left- wing organisation of then1970s; in this story, the police are finally closing in on the remnants of the gang (who are still wanted, among other things, for murder) after over 30 years. It's a good premise, and the movie is unfashionably sympathetic to its protagonists, respecting their idealism whatever wrong they did. Yet in some way it's the wrong kind of sympathy: the individuals are shown as parents, grandparents, living conventional lives, not completely rejected their own past but nonetheless no longer people one could imagine committing such acts. I think there's an interesting subject: what conventionally speaking might be considered defects would drive someone to ignore their own immediate interests for the sake of a cause (and ultimately drive them beyond mere idealism to take a Raskolnikovian view that their cause gives them the right to decide who lives and who dies). The idea of idealism as a social disease (because society depends on its members not asking too many questions) is an obvious and interesting question to raise in this film; but instead we see a group so well-socially adjusted that it's hard to believe in any of them as trigger-pullers, even in a former life.",/review/rw2778049/?ref_=tt_urv

24 April 2013,ken_bethell,6," Peter Pan isn't alone!
","The first thing I would like to say about this film is that it kept me entertained for two hours without once glancing at the clock.This in itself is no mean achievement in an age where many movies are unnecessary long. Hollywood obviously believes length is important if you want to be successful. Entertaining as it was I'm not so sure it was plot that kept me watching as much as the parade of veteran actors on display. A rather disparaging comment and maybe one that should have been reserved for the confusing historical context of the storyline itself. Being of an age that remembers the activities of the Weather Underground I was under the impression that their acts of terrorism had ceased by the time the Vietnam peace agreement was signed in 1973 since the Vietnam War had been the organisation's raison d'etre but in this film the Weather Men are still on a mission as we approach 1980. The film also has amusing parallels with another piece of Redford left-wing theatre, 'The Way we were'. In this 1973 film the Redford character, a talented screen writer, backs away from confrontation with the Communist witch-hunt in Hollywood and seeks respectability by compromising his ability and forsaking the woman he loves in the process. His 2012 alta ego also loses his passion for the cause and sacrifices love and a daughter by walking away, 'I grew up'. In both films Redford played people much younger than himself. I'm not sure what this says about Robert Redford but I think my wife summed it up when she remarked after watching an early scene in 'Company, 'He's not the father of that young girl, is he?' Exactly, a 75 year old unconvincingly playing somebody twenty years younger while in 1973 film he was a 36 year college student! Anyway,enough of Redford who otherwise gives a competent performance. It was good to see Julie Christie again and who along with Nick Nolte, Susan Sarandon and Chris Cooper and still capable of teaching the young pretenders a thing or two. All in all and enjoyable and nostalgic evening's viewing.",/review/rw2778049/?ref_=tt_urv

15 June 2014,eddie_baggins,2," An awful movie with out of form actors all round
","Sometimes there is just no beating around the bush and in saying that The Company You Keep is a very bad film, a film that is quite clearly a vanity project for the ever aging Robert Redford and a film that obviously was thinking it was onto something very good indeed and that awards and critical plaudits were there for the taking. Sometimes there is just no beating around the bush, they were all very wrong.",/review/rw2778049/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2013,engelst,4," Unexpectedly cheesy and boring
","I fell asleep halfway the movie. I've seen a few Redford movies (as a director of course), and although I'm not a hardcore fan, I certainly sympathize with his efforts for the film industry and respect his work as a director.

13 September 2013,kosmasp,9," And what a company it is
","Just seeing the people on screen was a treat. All those fine actors (though in different scenes and not assembled), even in very small parts. Redford has that gravitas and pull to get people, even if it's just for a minute or two. Apart from the who is who of some of the finest actors still alive (2013 that is), we get a very intriguing story, with some moral ambiguity.",/review/rw2778049/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2013,doug_park2001,7," ""Now we're just a story told to children""
","First off, THE COMPANY YOU KEEP is by no means a ""thriller."" There is nothing in the way of fast action, not a shred of violence, no harrowing chase scenes, etc. The pacing throughout is slow yet steady. The first three-quarters of the film are simultaneously engagingly and ho-hum. I kept hoping that it would somehow pay off, and it does: The subtle threads come together, and there are some true surprises. By ""true,"" I do not mean anything earth-shattering, just, well, truly surprising. THE COMPANY YOU KEEP quietly touches on a lot of themes, but in the end it's more about the camaraderie (as well as suspicion) that endures between old friends/conspirators than it is about what's happening with all of them in the here and now.",/review/rw2778049/?ref_=tt_urv

19 May 2017,sddavis63,3," Not A Particularly Gripping Movie
","Although I realize that the movie is based on a novel and is entirely fictional, my first hope when I decided to watch it was that I might nevertheless learn something about the Weather Underground. I'm fairly familiar with US history, but I have to confess that all I knew about the group was that it was a violent anti-Vietnam group, so I looked forward to gaining a little more knowledge. That possibility was put to rest by the fact that the movie has the group pulling off a bank robbery in 1980 - long after the group had ceased to exist. (Why the bank robbery wouldn't have been put farther back into the past to make this more believable is a mystery.) So my primary hope in watching this really wasn't achieved. But how did it work as a movie; as a piece of entertainment? I can't say that I found it a gripping two hours.",/review/rw2778049/?ref_=tt_urv

","Start with a cast too familiar to believe in their roles. Robert Redford by any name is Robert Redford.

Jackie Evancho is at least a fresh face, and does a great job in her role.",/review/rw2778049/?ref_=tt_urv
