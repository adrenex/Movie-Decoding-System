22 March 2020,swordsnare,7," Luc Besson's 'Lucy'.
","I enjoyed this for the most-part. The momentum in combination with the 90 minute runtime, kept myself entertained for the entirety. It's far from perfect, but it's entertaining. Then again I didn't labour over the science to over complicate the overall enjoyment. The climax is probably the most contentious and unfavourable issue, but I appreciate the intent of Luc Besson's vision.",/review/rw3059105/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2014,gogoschka-1,," An original take on the superhero movie; silly perhaps – but great fun
","After the many scathing reviews, I went to this film with very mixed feelings. I certainly didn't expect serious Sci-Fi – after all, I had seen the trailers – but I actually wasn't quite sure what to expect (and I'm not sure I would have gone to see it at all, If it hadn't been directed by Luc Besson). Well, maybe it's just because I expected to be disappointed, but I was pleasantly surprised. 'Lucy' delivers a fast paced, crazy ride from start to finish, and I'm frankly a bit shocked so many people seem to hate this film with so much passion. Hadn't they seen the trailers? I thought it was clear from the get-go that this film was first and foremost meant as entertainment (and it certainly doesn't pretend to be the new '2001').",/review/rw3059105/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2018,latinfineart,9," A spectacular film- visually stunning - very through provoking
","Unless you are nearly brain dead, you will find this film stimulating. If you are a sci-fi buff like me, even more so. A film like this reminds me of how starved some of us are for films of this sort. This film was brilliantly directed by the French Maestro. Beautifully acted, by Scarlotte Johansson.

21 April 2015,SnoopyStyle,6," Fun action thriller turns into mumbo jumbo
","Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) is studying in Taiwan. Her new friend Richard tricks her into delivering a suitcase. It's filled with a new synthetic drug CPH4. She is kidnapped by kingpin Mr. Jang and forced to be a drug mule surgically inserted into her abdomen. She is kicked by her abductor and the drug seeps into her system. Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) has a theory about the human mind. Most use only 10%. The drug opens up Lucy's mind turning her into a superhuman as she uses more and more of her brain. With the help of Paris police detective Pierre Del Rio, she tracks down the drug from the other mules and contact Norman to transcend her humanity.",/review/rw3059105/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2020,rwmitchem,10," 1 Star people are ignorant
","Did the title get you here? Good. This is important. No movie deserves 1 star.
Perhaps if someone were to film dog poop with their 2009 cell phone and shake the phone excessively every other minute, then maybe that movie would deserve 1 star. Maybe.
People that give films 1 star are being intellectually dishonest. If a movie has a premise, which Lucy does, and it has a decent flow of a story line, and it does, then it's already achieved more than 1 star.
One review on this app the person said that they hadn't seen the movie, but gave it one star because people use 100% of their brains. Well it's obvious this person has never seen other sci-fi films. There is no such thing as a Wookie, lightsabers or fast than light travel. You know, fiction.
Seriously, people that give one 1 star reviews don't deserve the technology they used to write the review.",/review/rw3059105/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2014,facorread,10," This is a complete myth! The fun part is: What if it was true?

26 May 2021,ultra-taya,9," Super dynamic and intense action film
","I dont get the low Ratings. This film is not a philosophical work, neither it is an intelligent written story about our capabilities. Well these topics are part of the story of course, but the focus is on action sequences. Lucy is full of action, very dynamic and intense. I couldnt get my eyes off the screen for the whole film.",/review/rw3059105/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2014,Dr_Sagan,," Lucy took the drugs, Luc Besson got high...
","Obviously the main purpose of Luc Besson with this was initially to please the audience. The poor scared girl who takes revenge on the bad guys that hurt her. But with the ridiculous premise ""what can we do if we acquire the 100% of functionality of our brain"" the movie tries to be philosophical and ...fails miserably. What is the meaning of life? The purpose of humans?",/review/rw3059105/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2014,sonekken,8," A mix of science and fiction?
","I think bad reviews come mostly from people who want to show other how good their science is. Fair enough, this film starts from the premise that humans only use 10% of their brains and Lucy can break this barrier and reach a whole new level in human evolution. This leitmotiv was quite smartly picked to raise interest,although scientifically inaccurate. However this film excites the mind of those who REALLY know physics and know how few limits there are in what we can achieve in pushing our evolution through science to become indistinguishable from magic. ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" I personally enjoyed every bit of the movie and, as it took me to a journey into the far far future, where humans can overcome their humanity and become real Gods.",/review/rw3059105/?ref_=tt_urv

27 September 2014,TheAnimalMother,7," What Is The Limit Of Your Imagination?
","In my view this is the best film Besson has directed since 1997's The Fifth Element. The film in certain ways is a lot like Limitless, but at the same time it takes a very different overall approach and look on the subject of human evolution. I'm sure that many people will not care much for this film since it is filled with a lot of mystical/spiritual references and ideas and even some false science, however those with an open mind and an active imagination will likely be very glad they saw the film. This is clearly a work of fiction people, but there is no one saying you can't relate fiction to reality either, and actually learn something from it once in a while too. Our limitless imaginations are part of what makes human beings so extraordinary, we are best off using this gift and appreciating it. Fictional films can still be very thought provoking, and this one definitely fits that category. 2001: A Space Odyssey isn't scientifically accurate in many ways to our current knowledge, but it's still a monster landmark of a film nonetheless. Lucy is certainly not 2001, however they both ride that same imagination rules line that can spark the internal fires of unique creative thinking. In my view Lucy is a sci-fi trip worth taking. 7.5/10",/review/rw3059105/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2017,bheadher,8," A Bizarre Flight of Fantasy, but WOW...

2 August 2014,matthewssilverhammer,8," Scifi Action Thriller that Delivers
","Lucy is a Bourne Identity meets Kill Bill meets Limitless romp auteured by Luc Besson, the man behind classics like Leon the Professional and La Femme Nikita. In one of the stranger wide releases in years, there is much reward given to those willing to give Lucy grace (ridiculous premise and over-the-top aspirations). It's flawed, but it's a brightly filmed and darkly themed scifi action thriller that delivers. Lucy posits the debatable notion that humans only use 10% brain capacity. Johansson plays the title character that goes from monotony to superhero when a new drug gives her the ability to use 100% of her brains power. Her capabilities aren't just big math problems and fast reading, but telekinesis, shape shifting and other comic-booky things. It's a fascinating if overly ambitious premise that Besson puts to great use, playing it out like a briskly paced, inventive TV pilot. The scifi is strong, with theories and declarations posited throughout and thematic exposition that works. The shining element here is Johansson, who continues her upward trajectory in a bombastic yet effective performance. Her progression from a nobody to the most powerful femme fatale in history is emotional, funny and relatively believable. It's great to see Besson bounce back after The Family to present what may be his magnum opus, touching on all of time and creation in under 90 minutes. Sure, some of the effects are cheap and goofy, but the editing is unique and tight, the violence and style are lively, and the storytelling is refreshing. Engaging and cool, Lucy is highly stylized scifi pulp of the highest order.",/review/rw3059105/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2014,claudio_carvalho,5," Pretentious and Disappointing Combination of Action and Art Films
","The American Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) is studying in Taiwan and is dating Richard (Pilou Asbæk) that she met at a nightclub.

","People say we use only 10% of our brains. The scientific community is 100% sure this is false. Call me a killjoy, but I find it hard to accept movies that are based on an utterly anti-scientific premise.

28 May 2022,bcnkor,10," we use more than 10 percent of the brain, but we only understand 10 percent of how it works.
","Although in the movie it is very explained that up to a high percentage of using the brain today many things have been created in humanity, but we have lost our humanity for the interest of money and power. But the best thing about this movie and its great director is how it has shown the evolution over time of the stored information of cells and genes, although it is not real, it is very impressive as it has been narrated backwards in the history of the human life.",/review/rw3059105/?ref_=tt_urv

6 October 2014,gnanag,9," Unusual, interesting and highly entertaining
","Normally I don't write reviews but these movie differed so much from what people told me I fell compelled to give my opinion. Because of the bad reviews I didn't expect anything at all. In fact, I expected a killer heroine who would beat her adversaries to pulp. However, I got an extremely interesting, unusual and highly entertaining story, that I found quite fascinating. Of course, it's completely unrealistically, but the whole idea is quite funny and unusual. I generally like movies which manage to introduce new ideas or differ from the same old boring patterns (Iron Man 12, Final Destination 14, Transformers 8). Lucy does that. Its just, well, cool. I absolutely enjoyed the Science Fiction aspects and seeing Lucy developing her powers was just pure gold. So if you don't break into tears because the movie operates on ridiculous scientific premises, watch it and have fun. It's different, it's interesting and its extremely entertaining.",/review/rw3059105/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 2022,taropor,9," Incredibility with real human mind
","This show has a lot of action which shows human power. It makes me have goosebumps when human can do more than we thought. Moreover, human brains have more power that we usually thought. It shows the reality of human. Though it is a bit fake that human can use that much power when using brain 100% it demonstrates that human need consciousness and good mindset. As for acting, Scarlett really gets into that character because her facial expressions, the way she speaks and walk so simultaneously. I really enjoy watching this movie every moment because it teaches me useful lessons especially the way we use power. So awesome!",/review/rw3059105/?ref_=tt_urv

30 July 2014,Red_Identity,," Dear Christ
","I thought the commercials on TV for this made it look pretty good. When the reviews came in, I sort of lowered my expectations. Nothing could prepare me for how bad this truly was. From the beginning, it seems like the director is intent on overwhelming us with transitions and cuts from the present to all of these ""evolution"" shots that, instead of feeling creative or intellectual, just feel incredibly stupid. And I'm not one to throw the word ""stupid"" around, but... I don't know how else to describe how obnoxious and annoying I found the film from the get go. I don't care how scientifically accurate this is, no. I just care that the dialogue and directing really range from mediocre to atrocious. There are a few decent scenes, but few and far in between. The car chase is an example, like if it was a scene taken from another actually-decent action flick. I will say that the second half is at least a bit better than the first.",/review/rw3059105/?ref_=tt_urv
