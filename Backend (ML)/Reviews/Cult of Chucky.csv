26 January 2022,safenoe,7," Underrated
","Sadly this second revival of The Twilight Zone ran only one season, but it should have been a contender. The episodes had an edgier tone to the 80s revival (which I liked by the way) dealing with race for example.",/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,tailsofthewind,10," Why hasn't this been released for sale digitally?
",I've enjoyed the episodes on DVD for years and would love to add them to my digital collection.,/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2005,GEM-20,," Better than you might think
","I thoroughly enjoyed this revival of Serling's classic. In fact, there were a couple of episodes that were re-makes of original shows, and one was a sequel to an episode done back on the original series.",/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2005,radiopal,," Twilight Zone --- maybe...
","Okay, I bought the DVD at Wal-Mart and then read the reviews on IMDb, I agree with everyone that this is nothing like Rod Serling's Twilight Zone. However, after watching 3 episodes, I decided to watch the shows not as the Twilight Zone, but as an anthology series (there have been several, Outer Limits, Hitch Hiker, Night Gallery to name a few) and the more that I watched, the more I enjoyed it. Yes, it can never be adequately compared to the original, nor should it be. But if you decide to give the series a try, watch it as a fun anthology series. I was even thrilled to see a couple of ""tongue-in-cheek"" episodes. It will definitely be worth watching that way.",/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2009,jhearse,8," not bad at all
","I don't know why the some people seem to think this (2002) series was so bad. Sure, it's not the original. But like the remake in 1985, it has some good episodes and some weaker ones. we all loved Serling, but even some of the originals were a little weak at times. don't over-romanticize Serling. he was one of the greatest writers ever, but not just because of the twilight zone, but his great westerns, crime dramas, etc. and even the original series had a few clunkers - don't forget that he didn't write them all, anyways",/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2004,liquidcelluloid-1,," Even without comparing it to Serling's original, this is still bargain basement sci-fi

2 September 2008,johnnymacbest,8," I like this show, even though it's not quite up there with the classic.
","Let me just say that I like the show despite not being as good as the old ones. And even some of the episodes stick in my mind; especially the 1st one that sent chills up my spine after it's horrific conclusion. I even liked Forest Whittaker's opening and ending lines and though he's no equal to Rod Serling, he more than makes up for it in his own style and manner. I've seen nearly all the episodes on TV (well, the marathon actually) and they will always have a special place in my heart and memories but I also enjoyed some of the best episodes of this updated version for it's merits alone and I recommend ""The Outer Limits"" which is another great anthology series as well.",/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2010,torres_elias,8," Good but lacks a lot
","I wasn't born yet when the original and the first revival were made (I'm 24), however I was a big Twilight Zone fan while in high school. So the year was 2003 and the second revival was being aired on Fox... I was a freshman in college and had enough time to watch it. ",/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2002,Spooky2001,," An Interesting Show
","If all of the stories are similar to the first two then this will be a good show.  It has a great host and good actors(so far).  This show has a cool beginning.  I like the tagline, ""Leave Reality At The Door"" or something like that.  Jason Alexander was cool as ""Death"" in the second episode.",/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2002,Jennifertzfan,," This show sucks- I have a small spoiler
","I'm 18 years old, and that may make several people think that I've never even heard of the original Twilight Zone.  That's not true.  I am such a diehard fan of Serling's original TZ.  I must admit I was kind of had neutral feelings about this remake.  Part of me thought it was going to blow chunks, but a small percentage of me said that it might be good.  Of course, it wouldn't be as good as the original.  In this case, I was right about it blowing chunks.",/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2004,nlstock,," Absolutely dreadful version. The Twilight Zone is not supposed to be MTV.
","This 2002 version of The Twilight Zone has been advertised as ""with today's hippest young stars"". Well,that just about sums up this travesty because The Twilight Zone is not supposed to be MTV. This 2002 version starts off with a rock music theme and then goes downhill from there. I have not seen one good episode. The original and much better versions of The Twilight Zone made from 1959-1965(and also from 1985-1987)had scripts written by science fiction writers and had all sorts of stories. This dreadful 2002 version does not and just has doom and gloom stories that are not very well written or very well produced. I note that some of the people that were responsible for making the new version of the Outer Limits into a soft-core porn show were also involved in this awful 2002 version of the Twilight Zone. They have no idea of story at all. They should be kept away from classic TV shows before they ruin any more.",/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2003,DerekLee1,," Good casting, needs less predictable endings
","I am a huge fan of the original, but certainly don't hold that against the new show.  As with any remake in the entertainment industry (movies, music, television) I try not to compare the remake with the original and let them each stand on their own.  I do the same here.",/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2003,mattymatt4ever,," The only good show on UPN that I can recall
","I've seen very few episodes of the original ""Twilight Zone,"" so I'm probably a lot less biased than many people reading this, but I really enjoy this show!  The actors are good, the stories are unpredictable and usually contain nice twists.  Very few times does a TV show actually intrigue me. Forrest Whitaker is a fine narrator and has a creepy, soft-spoken vibe. He's perfect for a show like this.",/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2003,sp759,," Not even close to the original.
","the original twilight zone is one of the greatest shows ever aired.  this new version is crap by comparison.  i read the synopsis of the episode on one night, and it sounded like one of my favorites from the original series. i watched it and soon realized that it was a shoddy remake.  it was predictable, trite, and boring.  one of the things i love about the original is that you have to watch it from the begining because the show is so involved.  if you miss even the first minute, you get lost, i missed the first 5 minutes of this, and i still knew what was going to happen within the next 5.  the original is creative and suspensful, and fun to watch. often it doesn't even show a whole story, but just a glimpse at some outrageous situation.  this show tries to show a message and tie the story up in a nice little bow.  it's not the worst thing i've ever seen, but it pales in comparison to the original.",/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2007,g-valentin,10," Speechless...
","It has history, character and it takes you out for a walk in the world of what is surrealistically real! The Twilight Zone is one of the best television shows ever made. The concept of the show will be carried in my mind throughout my entire life. I must add that given the fact that it's characters change form an episode to another, the show remains self-explanatory and follows quite a strict behavior. It does not, however, become predictable or plain, but surprises with a juicy ending that lets you wonder and leaves you craving for more every single time. An idea well thought, a show that is worth the braincells it might kill, and a ZONE that no matter how hard we try, we can never explain.",/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2016,gridoon2023,6," Better than its reputation - rather underrated
","This much-maligned TV show is an honest, hardworking attempt to revive Rod Serling's classic TV series (respectfully, Serling receives a ""created by"" credit at the start of each episode). Truth be told, there are few outstanding/don't-miss episodes (""Sunrise"" is the best of all), but there are also few total duds (""Sensuous Cindy"" is probably the worst). Each episode at least tries to be about something, to present an idea, and to differentiate itself from the others. After so many years and so many ""Twilight Zone""-type movies and TV series, it's hard to come up with new ways to shock the audience. And yet, while some episodes (""The Collection"", ""Another Life"") are predictable, others (""The Placebo Effect"", ""Evergreen"", ""The Pharaoh's Curse"") manage cool and/or bleak twist endings. The two remakes of old episodes are well-done, and the one sequel, although less creepy than the original, at least has some sort of ending, which the original (""It's A Good Life"") lacks! Forest Whitaker looks somewhat uncomfortable stepping into Serling's shoes as a host, but the updated version of the original show's introduction is appropriately hypnotic. On the whole, ""Twilight Zone 2002"" was better than I expected.",/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2010,sebpopcorn,," Rod Serling is impossible to replace, but they didn't try very hard
","The original Twilight Zone was one of the best TV shows ever made. The writing was sharp and the ideas were fresh but more importantly tying the whole thing together was Rod Serling, a great presenter with real screen presence. So many movies and TV shows draw directly from his ideas that there should be a statue to the guy somewhere. I don't think many people would disagree that he was a unique and brilliant presenter and writer. But here's the bit that's going to make the majority of people go straight for the NO button on this review - a boss eyed staggering muttering black man is a poor replacement. No, not just poor, actually a pitiful replacement that renders this nearly unwatchable.",/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2020,sgtbert-1,7," It's more like the original than people give it credit for
","I notice that the people who hate this reboot love the original. I loved the original, too, until I started watching it in recent years, and realized it was my memory of the show I loved; the actual show wasn't as good as I thought. The ideas were great, but I believe they worked with a small budget and, although some of the actors were well-known, the shows didn't always do much to show off their talents. Most of the episodes leave me flat today, even though I do appreciate the plots.",/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2002,abrelosojos,8," First Episode
",Wow. What can I say I haven't seen many of the original episodes but this show definitely lives up to the few I've seen. The first half literally made me sick to my stomach and it had the classic reveal which made me think of the cook-book episode. I really thought i was going to puke. The second half was much more stomach friendly except for a few scenes. But I thought Mr. Alexander did a good job at playing a job-weary death. I'm looking forward to next weeks show.,/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2002,mike-320,," Excellent Show
","The endings aren't always the way you want them to be, and that is sometimes good.  There is always a ""lesson"" to be learned from the show and some insight to be had.  Story lines are good and I enjoy the show even though I never saw the old version.  I recommend the Sci-Fi'ers and anyone interested in paranormal and twisty story-lines.",/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2009,wilddon,," Big Possiblilties
","This incarnation of The Twilight Zone had immense possibilities. Some were realized, with a new on-screen host, and some good stories. It is hard to recreate the original, but I think this series made a bold attempt. Old Twilight Zone themes of prejudice, fear, science gone awry, and the wonderful, and awful potential of the human spirit are examined. I would have liked to see the series continue past the one year mark, but sadly, this was not to be. I think Rod Serling would have been proud to see a black host, as well. Things have changed a lot, since 1959, when the original Twilight Zone premiered. These changes were dealt with, often cleverly. I recommend that this series be viewed.",/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2017,jdollak,5," Not the Twilight Zone, but has something to offer

4 September 2016,Realrockerhalloween,," The Zone Awakens
",Another heave hole try in the enchanting world created originally by Rod Sterling now updated for a new generation and failing terribly. Going 44 episodes the new Zone ranged from a great idea taken in a great direction before crashing and burning anticlimactically. Most of the caste were washed up hasbeens or no talents and never have any emotional impact. ,/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2003,Minerva_Meybridge,," COULD IT POSSIBLY GET ANY WORSE?
","Rod Serling must be turning in his grave.  The writing is unimaginative and unoriginal.  Like the New Outer Limits (same producer), it lacked all the spark of the original.  Rod Serling's Twilight Zone was about the monkey's paw, twists of fate.  It aired simultaneous to Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and while not as stylish, still possessed a rhythm and a manner all its own. This new series is nothing short of a painful title-stealer.  Someone said, ""Hey, we can make a kagillion bucks if we capitalize on the Twilight Zone name.""  Unfortunately, none of the writing or directing talent accompanied the deal.  Amazing where nepotism can get you in television.  The networks are controlled by very few producers, who like to feed us garbage in spoonfuls and I, for one, am fed up.  I admire innovated shows like ""24"", ""Push, Nevada"" and ""Gilmore Girls,"" and I abhor such travesties as this. With only a few decent half-hour segments to its name, this is not the ""Twilight Zone.""  It is the ""Twilight Zone Blown.""",/review/rw0872945/?ref_=tt_urv
