9 December 2017,TxMike,," Atomic Blonde: The Coldest City.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library system. It is set in November 1989, a significant year for us for a couple of reasons, in Berlin right before the fall of the Berlin Wall separating Communist East and Democratic West.",/review/rw8514136/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2018,jb_campo,7," Charlize Theron kicks butt and takes names
",Atomic Blonde is the story of a British secret agent (Theron) who gets sent to East Germany around the time of the Berlin Wall removal. Her task - find the list of British agents that is apparently for sale and will endanger all of Britain's undercover agents.,/review/rw8514136/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2018,Miles-10,8," This is Entertaining Though Not Everyone's Cup of Tea
","Stylish, eye-popping, bouncy. The story, acting, music are energetic and fun. The plot is not realistic even though it references some of the realities of a time and place: Berlin, Germany, 1989. (I like the disclaimer at the beginning that gives the historical background and then says, This is not that story.)",/review/rw8514136/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2019,funtasticfour,6," Great action but boring story
","I love Charlize, but I'm getting a little tired of James, as he seems to be everywhere lately. This movie looked great, and I love the era, especially with the background story of the Berlin wall, but I just didn't care about the characters much, nor the story. The action was fantastic though, and I wish there were more of it. Perhaps a laugh or too occasionally would have helped as well.",/review/rw8514136/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2021,Toph-22,8," Convincingly good fight scenes
",'Atomic Blonde' is one of those movies that I can watch over and over again and it just doesn't lose its impact. When I saw the movie for the first time I had no expectations and I was more than convinced. Since then it is one of my favorite movies and that although it is certainly not a masterpiece.,/review/rw8514136/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2019,Morten_5,6," Amazing fighting, amazing Theron
","Former stunt performer and coordinator David Leitch's directorial feature film debut features an absolutely stellar and most cold-blooded performance by Theron, whose fighting scences are incredible. Nice camerawork and soundtrack choices.",/review/rw8514136/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2022,v_danilovic,8," Putting out Fire with Gasoline
","So many negative reviews - why I wondered. Then it sunk in. Many viewers misunderstood the premise. This film was adapted from a graphic novel series, basically adult comic books. Don't compare it to The Spy who Came in from the Cold; instead think Sin City.",/review/rw8514136/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2021,Holt344,9," Atomic Blonde is a a great spy thriller set in the Cold War and an incredible action film
","Atomic Blonde revolves around a spy who has to find a list of double agents that is being smuggled into the West on the eve of the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The film is directed by David Leitch and is written by Kurt Johnstad. You might recognize David Leitch from co-directing John Wick and serving as a stunt coordinator. Having him making his solo directional debut was something I looked forward to and he didn't disappoint. He brought a new story with a different protagonist and made something different but yet keeping the same quality. Charlize Theron was born to play this role, the dramatic part and the action part of the performance, she nailed it as Lorraine Broughton who are a top-level MI6 field agent. James McAvoy portrays David Percival, a maverick MI6 Berlin station chief who is assigned to assist Lorraine in her mission whilst John Goodman portrays Emmett Kurzfeld, a senior CIA agent working with MI6. The supporting cast has names like Til Schweiger, Eddie Marsan, Sofia Boutella, Roland MÃ¸ller and Toby Jones. Charlize Theron served as a co-producer alongside starring in the lead role, a role which she trained alongside Keanu Reeves and a couple of trainers to be able to do the stunt work necessary for the role. Both Charlize Theron and James McAvoy are terrific in this film, their performances are quite mesmerizing and they totally make their spy characters believable.",/review/rw8514136/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2017,kosmasp,8," Not so cold war
","When Charlize Theron is taking a bath (that is literally the first thing that happens in the movie), you see signs of things to come. And it again shows that she does not care too much about being portrayed as flawless as possible on screen. That also true of the fight scenes, which feel as real as possible while still stylized (it's one of the John Wick guys at the helm, it should be expected).",/review/rw8514136/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2018,mgruebel,7," La Femme Nikita in Berlin
","Leitch as director and Theron as producer really concocted a nice spy action film with Atomic Blonde. Set around the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall, it traces the attempt of a British agent (oh wait, or is it a CIA agent?) to prevent a list of friendly agents, available only engraved in a watch and in the mind of a German collaborator, to fall into the hands of the Russians. The film is framed by a debriefing, where Theron recounts her tale of sleuthing and mayhem.",/review/rw8514136/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2019,coachjacques,8," Better than most
","What a great nights entertainment. Clever, well acted, sexy and demanding, with everything that a spy/action movie should have but classier. DO NOT believe any of the pretentious reviews that look to bag this movie - it's great. Both leads are terrific.",/review/rw8514136/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2017,tomgillespie2002,6," Style over substance
","There is a scene about two-thirds into Atomic Blonde that will likely go down in cinema history as one of the most exhilarating displays of visual trickery and good-ol' fashioned stunt work that the action genre has ever offered. Charlize Theron's MI6 spook enters an apartment building in pre-Wall collapse Berlin with a wounded informant and battles gun-toting thugs up and down stairs, in and out of various rooms, using fists, knives, a crowbar, and just about anything else she can lay her hands on. It's a kinetic, utterly dazzling set-piece that eventually takes the violence outside and into a moving car, all in one long, mind-bogglingly complex take. It comes as no surprise that David Leitch, an uncredited director behind 2014's sleeper hit John Wick, is the man calling the shots.",/review/rw8514136/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2017,colewaters,10," Atomic Blonde
","Atomic Blonde is one of the coolest movies of the year. This movie was action packed the whole way through. If you are wanting a rush in the movies this is the movie for you to see this summer. The movie was not the only good thing about the movie the acting was on point, the action was great, and the soundtrack was totally 80s. Thus was definitely a mind blowing action film.",/review/rw8514136/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2017,RodrigAndrisan,9," If you want some adrenaline...
","You do not want to have anything to do with Charlise Theron, believe you me! If you are a man and you had dreams of being a big macho guy, you were all wrong, you haven't met Lorraine Broughton yet, her character in ""Atomic Blonde"". She's stronger than men, she's fighting with more than one at a time, she's very bad. And, at the end, she kills them. She's gonna kick your ass too, no matter you'll do! Charlize Theron is cool just like the ice cubes in those bath-tube she takes in the movie. The other actors are OK, but due to Charlize's extremely strong personality, they all seem to be just a bunch of extras. Very good action, dynamically, nervously and spectacularly filmed. Good '80s music too, Peter Schilling - Major Tom, Re-Flex - The Politics Of Dancing, After The Fire - Der Kommissar, David Bowie - Cat People(Putting Out Fire), etc. Very good job, Charlize!",/review/rw8514136/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2017,albertusjohannesmaria,4," empty movie
","Atomic Blonde is Charlize's fantasy how she wants to be noticed by the public. I cannot say she fails, but neither can I say she succeeds. She is a great actress with stunning looks and brains. Her images for Dior perfume are classic and pure class. Charlize is Atomic Blonde, but the movie itself, well, the script is just plain stupid and silly. Basically, each spy is a double agent, there are lots of fight scenes and the movie skips from one encounter to another, and that's it. In other words, this movie is very empty.",/review/rw8514136/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2017,mailes22,1," Waste of time and money
","If you want to watch a movie produced by Charlize Theron and orchestrated solely around Charlize Theron getting her gear off in her first scene, followed by Charlize Theron sitting around looking very beautiful and sultry in extreme closeup in pretty much every other scene, then this is the movie for you. If you want any sort of plot or remotely believable action scenes, pick a different movie.",/review/rw8514136/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2017,statuskuo,1," Who Aren't You Cooler Than
","I wanted this to be good. But it's not. Charlize is so full of herself and her training that every frame looks like a sad pose. Because she wants you to think she is so cool. There is a MASSIVE difference between acting cool and being cool. This 'aint it. And honestly...if you want to be a spy, stop standing out like a supermodel.",/review/rw8514136/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2017,j2k_,4," Overly slick and superficial. Ultimately boring.
","The film 'looks good' in a way few others do. That is not meant as a compliment, it felt as though the aesthetic was the ONLY thing the film's creators cared about.. even the soundtrack became irksome as one cool track after another was put in, for no apparent reason other than to keeeeep saying 'how 'COOL' are we?'. The lesbian sex scene.. Ugh! Like everything else; so contrived, so choreographed and so self-aware. ",/review/rw8514136/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2017,drjgardner,4," Atomic Bomb
","If you want to spend half the movie looking at closeups of Charlise Theron's face, this is the film for you. Most of the rest of the film shows you her walking around London, walking about Berlin, walking around the airport, walking up the gang plank, etc. Every so often, but rarely, there is an action sequence that looks pretty staged. If this isn't enough to warn you away, the music is so loud it's a constant irritant.",/review/rw8514136/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2017,morrison-dylan-fan,9," Blonde du Look.
","Discovering the movement when watching 100 French films in 100 days in 2016,I've always been disappointed about not having the chance to see a CinÃ©ma du look creation on the big screen. After the trailers caught my attention, a pal spoke to film reviewer Kim Newman,who along with revealing that the ending of the film is an ""unofficial"" remake to the Film Noir The Big Clock,also said that the appearance of the flick matched that of Nikita and Diva, which led to me seeing du Look turn blonde.",/review/rw8514136/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2017,kinsmanivan,6," A definitely over-rated film in my opinion

23 January 2020,dar0417,6," Action Action Action
