8 February 2004,cariart,8," ""Buffy"" Lite, but Full of Charm!
","I couldn't say whether or not ""Charmed"" offered an accurate representation of witchcraft, but let me give credit where credit is due; it was consistently entertaining over much of it's eight-season run!",/review/rw5272651/?ref_=tt_urv

",Phoebe Halliwell (Alyssa Milano) returns to her San Francisco family home to join her sisters Piper Halliwell (Holly Marie Combs) and Prue Halliwell (Shannen Doherty). They rediscover the Book of Shadows and reclaim the witch family's Power of Three. Phoebe can see the future. Piper can freeze time. Prue has telekinesis. They are not allowed to use their powers for personal gains. Piper has a star-crossed relationship with white lighter Leo Wyatt (Brian Krause). The girls are helped by police detective Darryl Morris (Dorian Gregory). Phoebe falls in love with demonic ADA Cole Turner (Julian McMahon) in the third season. Prue is killed at the end of that season and Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan) joins them to re-establish the trio at the start of the fourth season. Paige was adopted and discovers that she's a long lost half-sister half-whitelighter. The eighth and last season has new witch Billie Jenkins (Kaley Cuoco) joining the trio after they fake their own deaths.,/review/rw5272651/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2002,AP-Project,," Imaginative and Engaging
","This is a wonderful TV show with great episodes that, in serial fashion, depict a constant battle between good and evil.  Evil, as in the Source, is very clever and wears many disguises. This is what's great about this show. Evil is never fully defeated, although the lackeys are destroyed quickly, the greater evil persists.  This presents a constant challenge to the Power of Three and they must always be on their guard. Other WB shows allow the hero or heroine to win very easily and the hero or heroine is too sarcastic. Charmed, however, has the right mix of all elements and the writers appreciate that evil forces that are truly dangerous and formidable create a more rich, tense atmosphere.  The fourth season was very good, and I liked Rose as Paige very much.  The chemistry between the sisters also carries the show and their personalities seem real and three-dimensional, while other shows of this genre fail in that regard.  This is one of the best written shows on television. It really deserves more critical recognition and respect, but if that doesn't happen, I'll still enjoy it.",/review/rw5272651/?ref_=tt_urv

","Okay, I just watched one episode a few week ago, and that was it for me. I AM HOOKED! I admit that this show is very addicting! Now, my Sunday's night are booked. ",/review/rw5272651/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2002,funky_little_angel,," An entertaining show that's really good.
","""Charmed"" is pretty much your average show about witches, but if you're thinking ""Sabrina"", you're wrong. Here's a show about three young women that are also witches - the Charmed Ones. They are also sisters. It's all about Piper (Holly Marie Combs), Phoebe (Alyssa Milano) and their long-lost half-sister, Paige (Rose McGowan). The eldest sister is actually Prue (Shannen Doherty) but she was killed of at the end of the third series. So they brought in Paige. Sure, there have been heaps of complaints about Prue being gone and Paige being brought in, but some people actually think Paige is better. ",/review/rw5272651/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2015,bkoganbing,7," Those Hallywell Sisters
","The occult got very hip on television with the arrival of Charmed. The show centered on three sisters played by Holly Marie Combs, Alyssa Milano and Shannen Doherty. As the show opened these three sisters who are their own BFFs discover they're the descendants of witches. But witches like Glinda the good witch. That doesn't mean that someone usually not of flesh and blood wouldn't want to drop a house on them as all kinds of evil things are tried against one or all of them every week.",/review/rw5272651/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2004,fishinbuddy2,10," GREATEST SHOW EVER
","I love this show! Where else can you get drama, comedy, and action all rolled into one? Watching the characters since 1998 has been fascinating! Watching Cole and Phoebe had me spellbound and longing for them to again re-unite. No it does not matter that he's a demon, he loves Phoebe and they need to be together. Julian played Cole brilliantly you never knew what he was up to and it seemed so real. Does he want to kill her or kiss her. You could actually see the expressions in his face change as his demon side would suddenly go soft when Phoebe said something sweet to him. ",/review/rw5272651/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2006,Sargebri,," Charlie's Angels Meet Bewitched
","I recently started watching this show a few months ago (it is shown on the televisions at the gym where I workout). When it first came out I thought it would be more along the lines of ""Bewitched"" only with more of the single girl on her own slant of ""Mary Tyler Moore"". However, as I started looking at it, it really was more like another creation by the late Aaron Spelling, ""Charlie's Angels"". The show pretty much is one of your standard issue action series with a supernatural twist. However, the thing that saves it is the relationship between the three sisters. Also, to me the show seemed to pick up steam once Shannon Doherty quit and was replaced by Rose McGowan. That seemed to put more of a humorous element into the show that it seemed to lack due to her character Paige's lack of experience at being a witch. This definitely is one interesting show.",/review/rw5272651/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2019,cdymally,7," Great Characters
",This show's strength is its characters. All three of the sisters are unique and make you keep watching. The show is fun and full of heart. The first three seasons are the best and seem to have a different tone and vibe than the following five.,/review/rw5272651/?ref_=tt_urv

22 April 2009,icet2004,10," Best Ever.
","Charmed is an American television series that originally aired from 1998 until 2006, when its network, The WB, ceased operation.The series was created in 1998 by writer Constance M. Burge and was produced by Aaron Spelling and his Spelling Television company, with the show runner being writer-director Brad Kern. The series narrative follows the four Halliwell sisters, Prue, Piper, Phoebe and, later, Paige, the culmination of the long Warren line of powerful, good witches. The sisters, despite being perceived as normal by the non-supernatural community, are known as The Charmed Ones, whose prophesied destiny is to battle against evil beings, such as demons and warlocks, in order to protect innocent lives from being endangered. Each sister possesses unique magical powers that grow and evolve, whilst they also attempt to hold normal working lives in San Francisco. Keeping their paranormal identities separate and secret from their ordinary lives forms part of the series' tension and challenges, with the exposure of magic having far-reaching consequences on relationships and has resulted in a number of police and FBI investigations throughout the series.This is my favorite show of all time.i loved it from my heart.i can't pick my favorite episode all were good. but i actually prefer these episodes where Prue was i loved her more than Paige.But Paige so damn cool too she was so perky and funny and sexier,but Prues acting was better And Of Course i loved Cole and baltazar too.Chris was interesting person. Miss this show so much.8 years a pure classic.",/review/rw5272651/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2021,Ginge74,6," Starts good, progresses downhill
","The first 4 series are good, entertaining, funny on occasion, but half way through series 5 it goes downhill...fast. The stories become ridiculous, the acting is unconvincing and wooden, and the special effects are less than special.",/review/rw5272651/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2006,nmorris1227,10," Huge Charmed Fan

","I got hooked on Charmed when I was 11. I didn't see it past season 4, because my favourite sister was gone. Twenty years later, I decided to rewatch it. The plan was to watch the first three seasons, but I found that I couldn't stop.",/review/rw5272651/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2016,kosmasp,6," Empowering
","The show made it, especially because of Buffy. Producers could see that putting female leads on a TV show can work and be successful. And it wasn't just successful. The light hearted tone of it, made it an easy watch. The jokes, the characters and the bond between the sisters made it all work perfectly (kind of like a charm if you will ... and one pun has to be made at least with a title like that).",/review/rw5272651/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2021,Larsii90,7," Fantastic show... until mid series
","Out of all the shows I have watch and loved during my lifetime, Charmed must be the one I have loved the most and the longest. I fell absolutely in love with it as a kid, and now as an adult I love it even more because I understand so much more of it.",/review/rw5272651/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2017,tapio_hietamaki,6," A harmless, fun fantasy show that gets really old really fast
","As a fan of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer', I don't think there's anybody who would seriously argue that 'Charmed' is the better show.",/review/rw5272651/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2020,moniliska-ml,9," Great show for fans of witches and supernatural stories

16 February 2005,ladyhawke9973,10," Glad the series is out on DVD...finally.
","Very pleased to see Season One out on DVD, we've been waiting awhile for it. The quality of the shows on the DVDs is fantastic...however there are no ""bonus materials"" whatsoever. As I don't usually buy a DVD for the extras, I'm not that concerned over it...however I am accustomed to them being there typically.",/review/rw5272651/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2010,Red_Identity,," Addictive and highly entertaining with some great characters and drama
","Charmed has always been seen as 'TV Fluff'. Yes, while it is not trying to make a social commentary or very important theme, it cannot be denied that it was one of the most popular shows during it's years running, and the reason is because it is a very well-written television series with entertaining story lines and characters.",/review/rw5272651/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2002,Nezz,," The power of three will set you free...really?
","Charmed is ok, I really like it actually.Pretty hokey stuff at times but at least it isn't pretentious...with a subject matter like the ""occult"" I think they've hit a perfect blend between respect for the belief and entertainment for the masses.I have been watching it from the beginning, but I just hope that people don't take the storylines too seriously and think that people are born witches and all the other over the top stuff. It's just good entertainment, and yes the charmed sisters (even Rose Mcgowan -sp-) are pretty, something special for the guys I suppose.",/review/rw5272651/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2006,inferno272,1," Horrible. Quite possibly the worst show to ever air for more than 3 seasons.
","So lets get one thing straight, I've watched the first 7 years, many episodes more than once. Why? simple, I'm a 26 year old guy, and I like to look at the bosoms. Thats it. I'm a HUGE HUGE HUGE Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan, but not because of the plethora of attractive women that appear on that show. No, because of the writing, depth, and emotional resonance. Charmed will always be known as a Buffy clone w/o any of the good writing, acting, story lines, depth, and as i mentioned, emotional resonance. ",/review/rw5272651/?ref_=tt_urv
