11 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,9," Huge Superman fan and I enjoy it!
","Superman & Lois is every bit as good as I thought it would be! Admittedly, I'm huge fan of Superhero movies/shows and Superman and Batman have been my favorite since childhood so I was really looking forward to this since it was announced and has not disappointed. While Henry Cavill is the best Superman ever (my opinion of course) and Tom Welling (Smallville) was the best on TV, Tyler Hoechlin more than held his own and makes a great Superman/Clark Kent! I admit that the kids can be a little annoying at times and are the only negative on a great show. This is the best CW show since the early Arrow seasons. I can't wait for more to come!",/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Terrific!!
","Superman and Lois is the best DC CW show outside of Arrow. Tyler Hoechlin is so much better than I expected as Superman and Clark Kent. I hope he continues to play this character for years. They probably could've cast a better Lois though, Elizabeth Tulloch is just not a good Lois Lane and looks much older than her age for some reason. This is a Superman show unlike any that's ever been made, it focuses a lot more on his family and his personal life than we've ever seen. I didn't think I would like that part of the show as much but I do, they make it very interesting and of course all the scenes with him as Superman are amazing. It has a cinematic feel to it. I definitely recommend this show to any superhero fan.",/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2023,saullodanielle,8," Never watched a Superman tv series
","I bowed out of Arrow after the first few seasons and only watched some of The Flash. I have watched every Superman movie. I was actually surprised I truly got in to this series! I like watching SM struggle as a husband, father, son, brother, friend, SIL, and hero.",/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2021,samratsingraur,8," Feels like a fresh start, hope it not becomes a soap opera like others on CW.
","Superman & Lois is far more entertaining than its fairly generic title might suggest. The series makes the most of Tyler Hoechlin and Elizabeth Tulloch's chemistry, utilizing the two characters and their romance in a way Supergirl never could. Superman & Lois may feel utterly divorced from the rest of the Arrowverse, but that's just as likely to be a selling point for many viewers. The only thing to hope from this show that it remains a balanced blend of genres but not a soap opera like others on CW. However, the premier is really likeable and that intense cinematography gives a touch of man of Steel mixed in Smallville. Really hope the writing and script remains creative and entertaining.",/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2022,tomjoyce1964,9," I love this (very silly) show!!
",I could write a novel about the things in this show that make absolutely zero sense (or less). You have to suspend your disbelief A LOT and then not think too hard about what's going on. And most of the actors are tier-C talent. A lot of the plot lines are soap opera-y cliches. And there are cliff hangers. And some cheesy effects. And annoying teenagers.,/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,lakings97,8," Fun and likeable
","Superman & Lois: Season 2 was just as entertaining as the first season. This season the family deals with secrets and how they should handle the family secrets. Tyler Hoechlin is back as Superman and he plays the role just as well as Christopher Reeve. The one thing I don't understand is why they cast Elizabeth Tulloch as Luis Lane, she is eight years older than Tyler. The protagonist this season is a lady that runs a cult to bring two worlds together. The story was intriguing and we get to see the next generation of superheroes. Definitely a great series if you like fantasy DC origin superhero's.",/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2022,OceanGirl941,8," I'm on the fence
","I'm hoping this series improves. This second season wasn't anywhere near the same level as the first. It has a lot of potential, but it feels hamstrung by CW. That shouldn't be a surprise to anyone by now.",/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,mikeacousticmusic,8," Season 1 is excellent
",I greatly appreciate the series so far. I take time during housework and such to watch this series. So far so good. I don't have much else to add but even the actors (not all) but most are wonderful. I've learned some things too that have been useful in dealing with teens and my own personal life. From a tv show ---yes!,/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2022,denise-88152,6," Less Dialogue
","Simple critique....less dialogue between family members, neighbors, business owners, etc. Too much drama!! Not to mention ""couple"" issues. Geez...do we need to drag them on....both brothers.",/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2022,ibrahimkhan-30185,4," Complaining
","It's whole series was about complaining,sister complaining sister ,brother to brother ,wife to husband,husband to wife ,daughter to father .every one was arguing each other just fed of all those stuff again and again .I fast forward to see some action because I already knows the story .complaining each other apology again and again fight aghhhhh.",/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,whiskeymovie,9," Based on the pilot.
","I am pleasantly shocked at how much I enjoyed the pilot. Nothing felt forced, the casting is remarkably good, the dialouge is well written, and for the most part it is very well acted. I am anxious to see if it continues this way. I love the ""humanizing"" of Superman, showing that he's not perfect. I never got into the CW DC shows really, but saw this on HBOMax and decided to give it a chance. Glad I did.",/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2021,hotrobinproductions,8," The Superman you've been waiting for
","Let's be honest I didn't have any expectations with this show. The CW has done nothing but disappointed us with the last 3 shows they have made (supergirl, black lighting, batwoman) I will say that those shows are getting better though... except for batwoman... but this is off to a solid start and I'm just judging it off the pilot but it does everything, checks the boxes and more. Can't wait for more.",/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2022,johnmondeng,8," Likeable characters
",I'm really out of touch with the whole superheroes universe in the movies and prefer things a little more simple and straightforward.,/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2021,Darwinskid,," So far, so...Good?
","The 'Arrowverse' as its called has not been in that good of shape in recent memory - The Flash, Black Lightening, and Legends of Tomorrow have all gotten very stale, Arrow's last two seasons were not very impressive, Supergirl's 'woke' factor has gotten to so big the show has almost no real story driving it anymore, and Batwoman has been terrible since its start and it somehow finds its way to get even worse as it goes on...Now I could take a moment to give praise to Stargirl, but...Different universe. Still DC and part of the multiverse, but not Arrowverse. Anyway, I liked Tyler Hoechlin's Superman in the second season of Supergirl, but the more appearances he made the less impressive he was, even during the Crisis event from 2019-2020 he appeared much less, well, super compared to Brandon Routh(as another version of the Man of Steel). Still, we have not seen a live-action Superman series in 20 years(Yes, Smallville is turning 20 this year) and the trailers raised my interest a little. The first ten minutes of its premiere won me over, and so far, with three episodes in, I am going to stick around. There are some questions of continuity concerning how the Arrowverse has played out thus far, but honestly given the less than stellar output of it in recent memory, the more detached it seems it is for the better. Didn't think Tyler Hoechlin would've effectively pulled off playing a dad to two teenagers given his age but he's made it work just fine so far. Hoechlin and Tulloch's chemistry is superb, their Clark and Lois dynamic is some of the best seen in recent memory, and better yet there seems to be a real storyline going on here that could warrant a full season of television. I must also praise the cinematography and the visual style of the series, not only is it quite detached from the aesthetic of the rest of the Arrowverse shows, but it feels like a good blend of Richard Donner and Zack Snyder. Remember though, still technically set in the same continuity of the woeful Batwoman and the gone-off-the-rails other shows, and given that The CW has a reputation for valuing politics over storytelling and always bringing down the maturity of the storytelling of their products, so enjoy the good while it lasts - hopefully, it sticks around a lot longer.",/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2022,melonycm,6," What is going on in season two!
","I am disappointed with the direction of season two what a snooze fest. The storyline just doesn't make sense anymore, the acting at times just very cringe! .Season one was so much better!",/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,iamanandroid,10," Refreshing and full of heart
","Superman & Lois is easily the best superhero show on television at the moment. It has an incredible cast with such amazing talent they blow me away with each episode. This show also stands out on the CW. Usually, going into a CW show I have low expectations as far as the writing and performance. However, Superman & Lois is so well written. It has heart and it cares so much for it's characters. Every single character has emotional depth, even the side characters and villains. And I love that the main theme of the show is about empathy and understanding. While he is the most powerful being in the world, he never takes the easy, morally questionable route. He sticks to his values and he has a sensitivity and caring nature that is so refreshing to see. I can't even begin to explain just how much I love each and every character in this show and how it portrays flaws and growth. It's also refreshing to see these characters actually communicate and listen to each other. There's so many bad writing tropes that get used to generate pointless drama and this show never goes that route. At the end of the day, this is a feel good show and always brightens my day. I'm very happy it exists and I hope it stays on air for many years to come.",/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv

17 March 2021,TxMike,," A welcome new series for Superman and Lois fans.
",I am writing this after the first four episodes of this new TV series. To be successful a series needs both good stories and interesting characters and this one has both.,/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2022,RockTrick,6," Thinking about avoiding teenage actors in shows
","It's good, but it's incredible how one can take the phenomenal world of Superman and make it so hacky. I kid you not, EVERY single scene that's not crime fighting is literally a therapy session of some sort. An argument, conflict resolution, family squabbles, some teenager throwing a tantrum or endangering others, causing a scene for no reason, etc. Ironically the most interesting story growth could come out of the teens and their derived powers, use of X-Krypto, etc.. but I said could, COULD but it doesn't. Shoot and a-miss.",/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2021,DarkVulcan29,9," Fun new take on the Superman story

Clark and Lois are also parents to two teenage boys Jonathan and Jordan. interesting to see how Superman will struggle being a hero and and a husband and a father.,/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2021,alanm-25031,9," So Surprised
","I havent been a fan of the CW superhero shows for a long time and I watched this just to see what they had done.
What a surprise! Well produced, good strong story to start, you feel the strength characters right from the begining.
Just hope this doesnt end up going like the other CW shows with silly story lines, too main pointless characters and the need to add team mate after team mate.
This felt like Superman lets keep that.",/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2021,Ed-Shullivan,8," Good series which is packed with adventure and the content and story lines will appeal to a broad audience
",It appears the writers put an extra effort into the Superman and Lois storyline and the pilot episode is brimming with adventure. Initially it tells the story of how Clark Kent has spent the past thirty (30) plus years and now he is married and he has a family of his own. This new adventure series has introduced us to an all new cast of characters as well as some old reliable ones that seemingly broadens the series scope to appeal to a new generation of Superman fans as well as some of us older generation fans as well.,/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2021,kleinjoshua-76516,8," Love it, only one issue
","I absolutely love this version of superman. He's good at it, the story is fun, and it's nice seeing back story.. Only downside, it's got that usual WB teeny bopper emotional garbage but it's manageable.",/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2021,davidjablonka,9," I genuinely hate CW...but
","I generally can't stand CW. Boring plot lines, poorly written, very cheesy and poor sense of tone but I was shocked by this show. I watched it on recommendation. I had a lot of trepidation, but within 10mins I was in. Really good casting, excellent tone throughout and a sense of 'realism that CW has really failed to do in the past. It's a very fresh take on saturated genre and overworked superhero and I'm excited to see where this show goes. I suspect it will get chappy after the first season, as usual, but I'm looking forward to this first one.",/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,kellindil-759-448828,4," good Superman actor, terrible plot, hard to watch at times
","I really enjoyed the actor playing superman, however whole thing feels like latin telenovela, it's mostly boring, plots leads nowhere, everyone is plain dumb, great finals of seasons are actually very disappointing and not really delivered.",/review/rw8474248/?ref_=tt_urv
