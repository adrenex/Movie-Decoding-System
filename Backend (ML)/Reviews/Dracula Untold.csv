22 January 2020,Tweekums,8," A solid Bourne spinoff... with no mention of Jason Bourne
","The 'Jason Bourne' movies introduced Treadstone; an illegal CIA programme where people undergo behavioural modification to become near perfect agents. Officially it was closed down but now somebody is reactivating these agents. Who or why is far from clear. It soon becomes apparent that the CIA isn't the only agency to do such work; flashbacks to 1973 show how a CIA agent captured by the Soviets has been reprogrammed to work for them, what they call a 'Cicada'. In North Korea an agent there is awakened and goes from being a piano tutor to being an assassin. If this weren't enough there is a nuclear missile outside official command in Russia and it looks like somebody wants to sell the warhead to the North Koreans.",/review/rw5272023/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2019,Thinker365,8," Nowhere near as bad or confusing as many reviewers suggest!
","The story follows several different dormant sleeper agents around the world as they get reactivated, while also depicting the fallout from project Treadstone in the present day. It also depicts the past, introducing how it all began. It is pretty well done, but it does have flaws.",/review/rw5272023/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2020,scottssherwood-45213,8," great story but be prepared to be disappointed...
","The last episode in no way gives a resolution to everything going on. finishes at least two episodes short. if they don't renew for a new season, we're all screwed!!!!",/review/rw5272023/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2019,random-70778,," Surprisingly bad. Plot and dialogue are cringe-worthy.
","Wow. I don't see how anyone can rate this mess above a four.
The dialogue is idiotic. And the plotting is absurd.
One of the professional reviewers, I believe it was Ebert, called this a ""mush' and I agree.",/review/rw5272023/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2019,joeyford-55342,8," Off to a good start!
","I love BOURNE and this is a lot like that. The only problem is the same issue I had with ATOMIC BLONDE, a little girl is not going to manhandle a big man. Some of the physics are weird like two cars bumping sideways so they both flip long-way. Otherwise, great stuff. Good action, the fight scenes are on point. The driving scenes are good. A little jumbled plot but I guess we will unravel the puzzle as we go. Good fun. One of our favorite shows on TV right now!",/review/rw5272023/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2019,namstonk,3," So much effort but little reward
","So I waited till the third episode before I made a solid conclussion. My conclussion, too much isn't the answer, characters, places, flashbacks, cramming in as much as possible has the opposite of the desired effect. In episode three the viewer is shown the happenings in four separate places in the space of a minute and a half, why, it's a TV series, they have plenty of time.
It tries to be gritty but sleek at the same time, some of the dialogue is crafted, some quite laughable, ""How did you become so strong?"". It all just seems to be rushing the storyline and forgetting the characters, you end up not giving a toss about them. As for the acting well a few standout but Tracy Ifeachor is woefully bad. If you like the Bourne series of films you won't like this, yes it will fill some time but you won't go out of your way for it.",/review/rw5272023/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2019,insideout098,3," All over the place...literally
","From endless flashbacks to some mind-control KGB experiments conducted after Viet Nam, to the endless array of test subjects running their own separate missions all over the world, I feel like I'm watch 5 different shows. No cohesiveness, no focus, just scattered pieces all over the place.",/review/rw5272023/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2019,Good-Will,4," If only they had spent more money on the writing....
","This could have been good, but most of the budget seems to have been spent on location filming, and although the locations are great then you need to put a decent plot in place, then add talented writers who can write a credible script.
Instead, what we have is an ever increasing use of clich√©s and tropes which is massively disappointing.
It may get better but after watching five episodes then the likelihood of that seems extremely slim, so I'm giving up on it since there are far better shows to watch than this.",/review/rw5272023/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2019,toadyblegh,4," Started well enough, but has started to drift...
","There's a lot to like about Treadstone. It's fast paced, plenty of action and tension, beautifully filmed and, for the most part, well acted. Sadly, the story has started to drift and becoming increasingly opaque and complex, with multiple converging story lines, some of which are incredibly silly (like a super-powered. super spy guarding a secret missile silo for decades in the hopes of one day restoring the Soviet Union). It's only three episodes in and the series has already jumped multiple sharks, while making it almost impossible to keep up with or care about an ever-expanding cast of characters. I'm already ready to just give up and watch something else.",/review/rw5272023/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2019,NotMoreMovies,5," What's going on?
","I already read a review similar to the one I'm going to write, but here's mine:
It started out promising, and them midway though the pilot it descended into madness. The plot that we thought was clear becomes splintered. We get glimpses of what's happening, but no clear objective. There seem to be at least 3 plotlines...one in the past, one in the future, and one in southeast Asia. And each show bounces us between them so fast we have no idea what's going on.
Did you ever see the movie Funny Farm when Chevy Chase wrote a novel? His wife's review of his book is kind of like this show. In one episode you get 3 flashbacks, 2 flash forwards and then you have someone who gets a flash-sideways :).",/review/rw5272023/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2020,muamba_eats_toast,8," Really enjoyed but frustrating non ending!
",The series was extremely good in my opinion not quite 10/10 top tier but one of the better action series around if a little predictable at tunes but just enough other twists to keep you guessing. Unfortunately however the series hasn't been renewed and the story did not conclude at all the most annoying thing when you get invested into a show! If you don't like that happening I'd give it a miss and save yourself the pain and annoyance.,/review/rw5272023/?ref_=tt_urv

2 December 2019,xjumper65,8," Bourne-Worthy Origin Story
","I think this show is well written, well-acted, well-shot, and well-choreographed. The entire show is faithful to the Bourne series not only story, cinematography, style, and feel but also in its multiple global locations. It's sort of an origin story for the indoctrination program that created Jason Bourne and the operatives like him. The fight scenes are high quality and Bourne-worthy and I have no doubt the actors trained very hard to pull these off. Kudos to the fight choreographer as well. I'm a big Bourne fan-I read the books in the 1980's and have owned and watched the movies multiple times and still think they are among the best action movies ever made. Having said that, I am enjoying this show more than The Bourne Legacy movie. Those who complain the story is confusing are likely not paying attention while watching or are so used to watching shows/movies where every detail is spelled out to the viewer. (See this guy with the black leather jacket, the nasty scar on his face, the milky dead eye, and the cat on his lap, well he's the bad guy). This is a somewhat layered espionage storyline that switches between present-day and 1973. The premise is that in 1973, the Treadstone project started creating sleeper agents cleverly named cicadas (insects that lay dormant for 17 years before returning in droves). Some unknown person is waking up these cicada operatives (who don't even know they are badasses) and sending them on missions to kill people with the ultimate goal of selling a decommissioned and unaccounted Cold War Russian nuclear missile to the North Koreans. Through period flashbacks, we get to see the Russians re-program captured CIA officers, completely wiping their memories and allegiance to the USA and turning them into badasses. Clearly, something goes wrong with one such operative who is on a quest to figure out who he is/was, what happened to him, what he's done, and who he needs to blame and seek vengeance on. In typical Bourne style, there is intrigue which forces you to pay attention, make connections, and wait for reveals. I know some people like to veg in front of the idiot box and not think, but not being spoon-fed a simplistic story is part of the enjoyment of this genre for me. Imagine that, TV you actually need to think about! The movies were also like this, but I suppose for some a chapter title that says ""Budapest 1973"" is not a big enough clue to let them know that what follows is a flashback to the early days of the Treadstone-type project. And if they can't decipher an on screen title written in plain English, perhaps it's too much to expect that the distinctive clothing, music, characters, names, and storyline would be clues they could pick up on to let them know they are watching a different subplot. Perhaps these viewer should stick to the Real Housewives. I would recommend they read a book to learn how to follow multiple subplots, but then again, the subtitles of my the Korean and Russian characters in this show are probably too much reading already. The reviewers who really confound me are the ones who claim to be confused by 'look alike' actors. The main storylines involve a North Korean woman, a black woman with a British accent, and a bearded American man of middle age. The only characters who are even the same race and age are two white males in their late 20's, but these characters are separated by 46 years and completely different sets, costumes, and storylines. One is a recently woken sleeper agent married to a brunette American and the other is a single man undergoing brainwashing by a Russian redhead. Aside from everyone and everything around these two characters being different, one looks like a male model and the other looks like Kevin Dillon. Anyone who can't tell these characters apart should be screened for face-blindness. This is a good show for any Bourne fan with at least half a brain. I hope there's a Season 2.",/review/rw5272023/?ref_=tt_urv

25 October 2019,roxmewild,9," Action thriller espionage what more can you want
","Ok I have only viewed the first 2 episodes but I am hooked, I love the fact you have to pay attention to understand the character build as it goes back and forth in time. I loved the Bourne films and find this as entertaining written by Kring whom I also like. I will continue watching and see how it develops.",/review/rw5272023/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2021,christophersarles,8," Started great
","Started off great, like a real old time Ludlum, then the writers got lazy. Episode ten, one min she's in Greece, and ten min later saving the dudes life in Amsterdam? Give us a break. If there's another season they better stop the broad daylight gunfights and impossible travel, we aren't morons. Don't take a great show and make it like all the other mindless drivel.",/review/rw5272023/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2019,bobmartens,4," Stupid
","All the money went into the visual production, and not the scripts. It looks OK, but a few episodes in, you should get the message: don't think while watching! Once the fighting ends, move on to the next scene. Dead henchmen and/or spies in the middle of Paris, but don't worry: just walk away, on to the next clich√©.God forbid the protagonists would get in real trouble. That would require writers instead of stuntmen, and without stuntmen this thing collapses. So: more stuntmen! Crahes, explosions, gunfights, yeah!",/review/rw5272023/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2019,hacks-56635,4," No idea what was going on or why I would keep watching...
","My honest opinion of this show is it is nothing special. I don't even know what it is trying to be.. I made it half way through the second episode after having been bored and confused by the first and well, for now, that's all I can stand.",/review/rw5272023/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2019,calhobbes99,9," Very gripping so far
",Very gripping so far. A bit confusing going back and forth in time and across 3 continents but once you get the flow it is worthwhile watch. Excited to see how the stories unfold.,/review/rw5272023/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2019,babarasghar,5," Nothing interesting here!
","The show is very generic, there is no connection to the Bourne Series. The show picks up from a scene which is so lame. Just a random guy used a word Treadstone which was used in the movies. No character development or anything. If Bourne Series CIA was super evil, this CIA is super dumb. It wont get a second season if they kept it like this.
I will check next few episodes before giving final score. Usually, im hooked to a show from pilot episode and it has never happened that a show got better afterwards, so i dont have any high hopes for this.",/review/rw5272023/?ref_=tt_urv

20 July 2020,HassanYacoob,7," Entertaining and confusing.
","Interesting and engaging series which began brightly but became increasingly muddled with the introduction of various plot intricacies. Some of the flashback scenes were a drag, even if they did provide some context to present day happenings. The fight scenes are quite brilliant though, even if unrealistic at times, reminiscent of some of what we saw in the Bourne movies. The first season ends in quite a cliffhanger and I do hope we see a second season soon.",/review/rw5272023/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2019,nicmegara,8," Potential is there.
","The main problem I have with this show is that it jumps around way too much. From different time periods to different characters ... I'm not a professional writer or reviewer but from a fans point of view I would like a minimum number of characters to follow in the first season. But this has way too many characters and time jumps to really grasps what's happening especially when trying to read the subtitles for the different languages (Russian and Korean) . So for me, if this centered only on one time period that would help with as many characters they want to use.",/review/rw5272023/?ref_=tt_urv
