22 August 2022,Her-Excellency,2," Nowhere near as good as the original
","I really enjoyed the first Orphan film. It was well-paced, atmospheric and creepy. This one does not measure up in any way. It starts out DUMB (sorry, but that is the best descriptor), and only gets DUMBER.",/review/rw8503886/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,jtindahouse,8," A rare prequel done right
",I recently watched a film starring Isabelle Fuhrman and remember thinking they are going to have a task on their hands making her look as young as she's supposed to for the upcoming 'Orphan' prequel. They did a pretty incredible job all things considered. I was sold.,/review/rw8503886/?ref_=tt_urv

21 August 2022,Dodge-Zombie,5," Very average.
",I went in not expecting much and wasn't disappointed. Here we have a prequel that may of worked better had it been made much closer to the original movie.,/review/rw8503886/?ref_=tt_urv

20 August 2022,bigbadbassface,2," These positive reviews have to be fake
","There was truly nothing redeeming about this movie. The character's motivations made no sense, and the dialogue was ridiculous. We loved the first one but this was a sequel/prequel that should never have been made in its current form.",/review/rw8503886/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,halfxbreed23,2," Horrible
","Trash from beginning to end, every weak scare to trick camera shot to make a 20 something appear to be a child. This film was so unbelievably irritating I'm shocked to see its score is 6.1 at the time of this review. What are you watching? The acting? The story? The horror? The incorrect second title? It wasn't her first kill! Not even close.",/review/rw8503886/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,flowerstardust1979,5," A Massive Let Down!
",I'm a massive fan of Orphan (2009) It was very well done with great actors so I was excited for this one ever since I knew it was being made.,/review/rw8503886/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,Misss25,5," Expected More :)
","I watched 'Orphan' about 3/4 years ago. From then to now, I didn't expected to watch another prequel . As prequel always comes with disappointment. I can't say it was that bad but again it wasn't necessary. After so many years after 13 years!",/review/rw8503886/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2022,3xHCCH,6," A Different Twist This Time
","In this prequel, a ruthless psychotic killer Leena Klammer was able to escape from the institution where she was confined in Estonia. She took advantage of her delicate child-like appearance to pretend to be Esther, the missing daughter of a wealthy American couple, Allen and Tricia Albright (Julia Stiles and Rossif Sutherland). Even if her subterfuge was not always perfect, Esther easily got close with Allen because of their common love for painting.",/review/rw8503886/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2022,Zedyeti,8," If you don't take it too serious it's actually entertaining
","Seriously some of these reviews make it sound like people were expecting a coen brothers movie lol. Sure it has flaws but if you just shut up, drop the negative Nancy vibes and watch it, it's entertaining. Of course it's different from the first film cause we already know the twist. They had to make it different or it would be lame.",/review/rw8503886/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2022,Xstal,4," It's a Hard Knock Life...
","After years of looking for her, she is found, the daughter who was lost, is homeward bound, it's a miracle, incredible, ever so slightly unbelievable, but the family's no longer crushed and feeling downed.",/review/rw8503886/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,mgentalen,2," Dissapointing and poorly mis casted
","Most prequels are honestly not good and do not come close to the original story. When I heard about First Kill, I was cautious. This is the origin story ( does every character need a origin now? ) of Leena causing trouble to the first family in Estonia.",/review/rw8503886/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,Neindude,2," So, apparently, insulting the audience's intelligence....
","Is the definition of nearly all modern horror/thriller movies now. Right from the beginning when I saw the guard being enticed by the titular orphan, I felt I knew what kind of ride I was in for. The whole brilliant escape plan solidified my view of it. Now maybe horror movies since long time have always shown some level of stupidy or ineptitude in its characters and I was just either oblivious or too much invested in those flicks, and maybe now I've just gotten bored of watching such character tropes. Or maybe it's just the audience that likes watching similar stuff again and again, or maybe the filmmakers don't care what they put out as long as they're thinking that their stuff might sell well. Whatever it is, I'm hoping for a game changer in this genre, which this movie isn't. Now on its technical aspects, why does this movie have a weird, hazy, ugly look? Was it supposed to look bad or just the cinematography process didn't work out as good? Certainly doesn't help to make it look better.",/review/rw8503886/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,thierryserra-05310,1," The good, The Bad and ... Orphan, First Kill
","Welcome to another review of the Good, the Bad and... . This time we are looking at Orphan: Fist Kill.",/review/rw8503886/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2022,Neptune165,2," The first one was so good and doesn't get talked about enough; the plot twist alone is something that I never would have guessed
","The saturation and the lights felt like some Instagram filter. It does take away a lot from the plot the fact that you already know from the first movie who she really is. Then the other twist is revealed and I was thinking that Julia Stiles character did something illogical to her intentions by accepting Isabelle Fuhrman's character into her family in the first place. I dunno, movie logic I guess. I was really disappointed in the quality of the look of the film (filters and lighting) it was so blurry I almost had to stop watching. Maybe it was worse. The perspective they showed Isabelle Fuhrman was horribly inconsistent throughout the film, even within scenes. There was one conversation with Julia Stiles early on where they showed her clearly barely taller than Julia's waist, then switched to a different camera and she was as tall as her shoulders! Also, the number of times they cut away from her talking to a shot from behind where they had clearly subbed in a child was really jarring. This was incredibly disappointing. The look of the film was a cheap Lifetime movie. The fact that she's older playing younger just doesn't work for me at all. Doesn't even come close to the original and is a waste of time. I felt disappointed. It is really awesome how they were able to use the same actress and the twist we get is interesting. But that's about the only two things I liked. I don't feel like the movie was long enough to flesh out the ideas. The weird filter on the movie kind of looked like a permanent glare. There were some Easter egg call backs to the first one, but the whole thing felt a little rushed and flat. Especially more so when watching it right after the first one. The way the tried to make her look like a child for the role is very uncanny valley but that's not a complaint. I'm going to give it a 2/10.",/review/rw8503886/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,IonicBreezeMachine,7," A bonkers follow-up to the cult hit, Orphan might not quite recapture the shocking twist of its predecessor, but it makes a hard turn from where you expect
","In Estonia 2007, Leena Klammer (Isabelle Fuhrman) is a 31 year old mental patient at the Saarne Institute who is criminally insane and suffers from Hypopituitarism that gives her the appearance of a 10 year old child. When Leena orchestrates her escape from the institute she assumes the identity of a missing child who looks close enough to her named Esther Albright. Esther is brought to the Albrights in Connecticut consisting of Allen and Tricia (Rossif Sutherland and Julia Stiles) and their teenage son Gunnar (Matthew Finlan). As Leena assumes her role in the Albright home, growing particularly attached to Allen, she finds her lies under ever increasing scrutiny from multiple parties.",/review/rw8503886/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2022,Vivekmaru45,1," Grossly inferior to the excellent 2009 thriller Orphan.
","In 2009 I watched Orphan which I thought was a unique film at the time. I was well entertained, and all the actors fit in and played their respective parts. There was a lot of suspense that held the film. There was a superb climax as well.",/review/rw8503886/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2022,cfr-56761,1," Plot holes were insulting

21 August 2022,InterMedia-1221,," Disappointment!!
",The original (Orphan 2009) without any doubt was amazing ! The potential was here with a lot of twists and extraordinary rotation and atmosphere.,/review/rw8503886/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,fuatinfo,3," The color grading is hurting my eyes!
",The lighting is extremely bad. Color grading is bad. Contrast is terrible. The out of focus feeling of the entire film is frustrating. DOP has done a terrible job and ruined a decent watching experience single-handedly. Good job.,/review/rw8503886/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,Chartreuse1,9," If you saw the sequel, you will love the prequel!
","Orphan: First Kill gives a little more backstory to Esther and how she came to America to begin with. However, the first family she becomes a part of have a few surprises of their own for her providing a nice, juicy twist to the plot. Talented actress Isabelle Fuhrman (13 years later) is still convincing in the role at 25 and able to pull off psycho Esther. The thriller element was definitely stronger in this movie and a lot more jammed in at a little over 90 minutes. Despite that, it was nice to see Esther back in action!!!",/review/rw8503886/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,gameskiller-07685,1," As a huge fan of the original, I'm sad

7 August 2022,gab-67599,9," !!!Great Pt. 2!!!
","As a big fan of pt. 1, when I heard about this one I just HAD to see it! It was not a let down at all. Even the twist was a wicked one, I didn't see coming. I can almost always guess the twists. Loved all the characters and the action was a bit more at the end but the whole movie kept you watching. My hopes for Ester is that she end up in a home with a loving Lesbians couple. Then her problems might cease to exist! Or possibly meeting another person like her and then they could kill together in the 3rd installment, I cannot wait to see! I would have definitely paid money to see this movie! It was very good, some parts far-fetched, but really believable actors! I only recommend if you were a fan of the first one. This one was better. I almost thought it was a different girl, it was crazy to think Isabelle Fuhrman was 12yo in the first one, and now at 24 (during the shoot) she still looked so young in this movie. And that was using no special effects or makeup tricks was what an article I read stated. CRAZY!!!",/review/rw8503886/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2022,AvionPrince16,5," Why that movie is released then?
","The movie feel like an excuse to make another movie with that name and to extend the movie to two realisations. What really make me pissed off in that movie its when we learn that not Esther and that someon who make people think she is Esther and just for that i found it pretty dumb no? I thought that was Esther and really feel that the directors make us feel pretty fool. For some of us they will say that is a twist and stuff but i really take that like a stupid thing and i dont really understand why they did that and we dont learn more about Esther at all. And some stuff was pretty stupid too: the father get well with her presence and get an improvment in his sexual relationship? Come on! And except that only the situation is horrific. The movie have some tense moments and violence but thats all. It didnt really terrify me. Only the scene with the rat in the drink of the mother was really disgusting but that was only that. Esther was at the beginning an intruder and become and intruder that the family want because it improve the mood of the father. And at the end, they cant stand that girl andhtry to kill her but she will have the final words to the family because she will be the only survivor to the incident at the end with the house in fire. Maybe they will make a third movie and i really hope they will make something more interesting and more scary really. I was pretty disappointed overall.",/review/rw8503886/?ref_=tt_urv
