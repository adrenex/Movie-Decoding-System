20 June 2002,TxMike,," Fairly good Sci-Fi entertainment.
","""Red Planet"" builds on an interesting premise - send bioengineered algae to Mars to produce oxygen so that settlers can leave the increasingly polluted Earth and preserve mankind.  However, the algae starts to disappear, based on Earth measurements, so about 2050 a team is sent to Mars to find out why. They encounter the mandatory storyline problems - a sunflare triggers a burst of radiation which mainly disables the mothership so the crew has to escape prematurely, but the captain (Carrie-Ann Moss of Matrix fame) stays behind to try and salvage the ship, otherwise they are all doomed to be stranded on Mars.",/review/rw1684822/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2009,Samiam3,7," Mars in 2000
","What a perfect rivalry this film has with Brian De Palma's Mission to Mars. Two films coming out in the same year, set on the same planet, with the same production values and featuring casts of equal talent. While both movies also feature numerous scientific inaccuracies and stupidities, each has something different to offer. If you are looking for mystique, try Mission to Mars, but if you want action or thrills, then go with Red Planet.",/review/rw1684822/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2005,Maciste_Brother,7," A straight-forward science fiction movie
","I avoided most of the Mars movies when they came out in the past 4 years because the reviews were mostly bad and none of the trailers inspired me. I eventually caught MISSION TO MARS on TV and I was glad I didn't see it at the movies or even rented it. But now I rented RED PLANET last night and I have to say that I liked it a lot. It's much better than the hokey De Palma movie. There are a lot of weaknesses in it but even with all it's faults, the whole package worked.",/review/rw1684822/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2005,tgarrett007,9," A human face to sci-fi
","I don't know why everybody rips this movie. The special effects are very realistic, down to the pink-tinted Martian sky. The plot is plausible (for science fiction), paying attention to many small details that often make these kinds of movies farcical. Most important, it's very existential; humans simply trying to survive against almost insurmountable odds. As the struggle builds, the relationships begin to gel nicely. This IS a movie about human relationships, not Star Wars style hype. I know, there are some weak spots. The opening and closing dialog, Val Kilmer whispering all the way through, some of the dialog, etc. But overall, this movie doesn't try to do too much (unlike the abysmal Mission To Mars), and that's what makes it a success.",/review/rw1684822/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2001,KatMiss,8," GOOD, INTELLIGENT THROWBACK TO 1950S SCI-FI
","Movies like ""Red Planet"" remind me why I enjoy science fiction so much. Most sci-fi films today put the special effects first before characterizations. While that's not a bad idea (I have enjoyed several films in that vein such as ""Independence Day""), films can become too dependent on that and that's when the fun drains away.",/review/rw1684822/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2016,Leofwine_draca,6," Enjoyable sci fi escapism
","This is a fairly enjoyable, old-fashioned slice of sci fi escapism which runs through all the old genre clichés without offering up anything you haven't seen before. Released at the box-office at around the same time as Brian De Palma's MISSION TO MARS, for me this is the superior film, although it has to be said that neither are great. Technically proficient, RED PLANET looks and sounds great but is oddly uninvolving. It's kind of like all those old '50s science fiction yarns in which astronauts land on a remote planet, combat and fight all kinds of foes and dangerous situations, and return home. Except the wobbly special effects and spaceships are now replaced with state-of-the-art CGI design and impressive, expensive visuals created by today's top computers.",/review/rw1684822/?ref_=tt_urv

24 September 2001,stamper,6," Much better than Mission to Mars but not good either
","I think it will take about as much time to see a good film about Mars as it will take mankind to land on it. Although this film is much better than the (oddly) bigger box-office hit Mission to Mars it still lacks a lot. OK Carrie Ann Moss and Tom Sizemore are good in their roles, but the plot is just too predictable at times. The biggest compliment though goes out to Val Kilmer who on his own earned one of the points I give this film.",/review/rw1684822/?ref_=tt_urv

","Looking at the other comments i think people really have a hatred to sci-fi films at the mo.  I know that Mission to Mars was bad, i'd be the 1st to admit that......but that doesn't mean that all other sci-fi films are going to be bad.  Last year we had Pitch Black which i thought was okay.........and we had Red Planet.",/review/rw1684822/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2005,Enchorde,8," An above average scifi thriller
","Recap: Earth is dying. Mankind's hope stands to Mars. Unmanned probes has sent a type of algae to the red planet in hopes of rising the oxygen level. All seems to go according to plan, but then all algae disappear and the oxygen level starts to drop. A team is sent to the planet to find out what is happening. But as the team approaches the planet, they experience a solar proton event, and the mothership sustains heavy damage. Most of the crew try to evacuate with the landing vehicle, but crashes. The senior member of the team is fatally injured. With limited air supply they head for the pre-built habitat. They arrive, and finds it in ruins. Soon out of air, all hope seem lost. But there are good news and bad news. The good news is that the atmosphere is mysteriously breathable. The bad news is that the team's robot AMEE (on loan from the marines) suffered damage in the landing too, and turned to military mode. And she thinks the ground team is the enemy.",/review/rw1684822/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2003,PhilCo126,," Non-exciting but realistic SF movie
","I was amazed when reading so many bad reviews . O.K. there're no spectacular Aliens and we're not blinded by non-stop special effects. The movie has more realism than the traditional Holywood science fiction stuff. Many parts of the Mars mission were based on the NASA reference Mars mission . The Mars explorer spaceship is build in Earth orbit . There're 6 crew-members . Artificial gravity to stimulate adaptation to Martian conditions . AMEE a multi-purpose robot with aerial probe . Cushioned landing . Wearable spacesuits . Other points of realism were the accurate 'fire in space' sequence, and the computer technology used by the crew. Red Planet could have been better, but it's decent compared to most  Holywood products. Moreover,  real science fiction is a very small niche market and will never draw nor encourage a broad audience.",/review/rw1684822/?ref_=tt_urv

12 July 2002,johngreviewcentercom,10," I couldn't get enough...very original!
","I honestly loved ""Red Planet."" I thought that Kilmer did a great job playing the ""rebellious yet skilled"" character that he was so deft at in the 80's. I also felt that Moss added another good performance that was similar to her ""soldier yet woman"" role from ""Matrix."" The thought of not only oxygen but LIFE on Mars had not really been touched yet but it worked out greatly..think about it: the actors can actually do their thing without having to wear a bulky space suit the whole time...it adds a lot of fast moving action and real drama to the movie. I also love Sizemore's performances. I guess if you like the actors and are open to a new kind of sci-fi/action plot, you at least should give this movie a shot. I loved it!",/review/rw1684822/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2001,m_ender,," Red Planet is a great rainy, Saturday afternoon film
","Whoa there kids!  Red Planet is just a movie and in my opinion a pretty good sci-fi picture.  Yes, it is not 2001: A Space Odyssey or Mission to Mars (which I think was ridiculous).  It is not meant to be.  Maybe the characters are not fully developed but name a science fiction movie where the characters are completely developed.  The movie is called ""Red Planet"" not ""Who are the People Who are Going to Mars to Save Earth?"" and we join the action ""in media res"" which means in the middle of things so character development is not stressed in the beginning.  Good grief.  People throw around scientific, cinematic, and character development flaws with the movie instead of trying to enjoy the suspense of this movie.",/review/rw1684822/?ref_=tt_urv

","Entertaining, but the politics of Earth's ""sky is falling trope"" began even in 2000. Why is it that Global Alarmist types logic religiously would believe that going to some other inhospitable planet like Mars would be easier to establish life by terraforming or industrializing (thereby polluting again like Earth's industrial revolution), when it would be beginning at zero, when it would simply make more sense to clean up the Earth, which is our perfect planet already where we evolved?

26 December 2001,Charles-31,2," Is this worse than Mission to Mars?
","I've had a real dilemma since seeing Red Planet.  For this year, which was the worse movie, Red Planet or Mission to Mars?  It's a tough call.  I gave both a 2, feeling the sometimes fun special effects saved each from being ""Plan 9"" level.  But, these are both truly awful science-fiction films. What is so amazing is how both turned out to be just about the same film. Both are based on the ""big accident when we get there"" plot line. At least Red Planet avoided the ""Faces on Mars"" nonsense of Mission to Mars.  But, the idea that we can have massive terraforming efforts going on on Mars including a built habitat without noticing lots of life forms, dramatically increased oxygen levels, and everything else this movie just pops out of the woodwork is so moronic as to be just about ""Plan 9"" level.  As if that wasn't enough, we throw in the ""killer robot""/""military hardware run amok"" standard plot line #17 just for good measure.",/review/rw1684822/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2001,Quicksand,7," Better Val than Nothing
","There are worse ways to spend 100 minutes.  Val Kilmer was lots of fun, Carrie-Ann Moss actually CAN act, and the screen-writers actually had HALF a brain.  Okay, so they ignored the whole gravity thing, but at least that had a reason why the characters didn't run out of air.

","This was the second Mars movie of 2000 with the first being ""Mission to Mars."" Both of them were so-so at best. This lackluster movie had a homicidal robot because it's always smart to bring a robot that will go into kill mode for no apparent reason. ""Red Planet"" also had an unstable crew member who killed another crew member because.... well, just because. And for the coup de grace there were carnivorous insects of some kind.

2 July 2007,thinker1691,7," "" Nice Job Space janitor ""
","The population of Earth has spent its life taking from it's mother without regards to consequences. The farther man goes into his future, the more aware of his mistakes he becomes. This film is one of a dozen which depicts what will eventually happen to the inhabitants when those mistakes catch up with apathy. The year is 2025 AD and Earth has sent it's first planetary probe to the ""Red Planet."" It's mission; to discover why it has refused to sustain an artificial atmosphere. A team of six, including a multi-functional, multi-purpose, mechanical robot named 'Amee' is selected and sent. However as the ship approaches its destination, an unexpected solar flare, disrupts the carefully planned mission, forcing the five man crew to eject prematurely to the hostile, lifeless, planet. Now begins an immediate and desperate objective; to stay alive. Val Kilmer is Robby Gallagher, the Machnical Systems Engineer who proves that when machines go bad, it's important to have someone who knows how to fix or combat them. Benjamin Bratt is Lt. Ted Santen, an ego driven pilot who finds it's hard to be humble. Tom Sizemore plays Dr. Quinn Burchenal, who searches for a reason to questions he knows have an answer. Terence Stamp plays Dr. Bud Chantilas, an engrossing astronaut who expects more out of the mission than mere science. Carrie Moss is Kate Bowman and Simon Baker is Chip Pettengill. The film is believable enough and the space crew's enemies are not confided to those expected. One, they brought with them. The further one proceeds into the story the more harrowing the dangers become. ***",/review/rw1684822/?ref_=tt_urv
