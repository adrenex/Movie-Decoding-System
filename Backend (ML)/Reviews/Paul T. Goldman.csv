26 September 2013,SnoopyStyle,9," high school teen drama for smart people
","Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) was previously a popular girl in school next to her rich best friend Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried). When Lilly was murdered, her father Sheriff Keith (Enrico Colantoni) arrested Lilly's powerful father, but later someone else confessed. They ran Keith out of office and Veronica became a pariah. Now she investigates the deep dark secrets of her school divided between the ultra-rich and the poor minorities.",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2019,pgreywacz-500-46798,10," Shocked and Disappointed
","I have watched and loved the show from the beginning. I was really looking forward to another season. I know things couldn't be exactly the same since they are older. But now two people are gone that are one of the prime reasons that I love the show. In my opinion, I wish the last episode had not been done. With all the junk and live shows passing as shows at all, I had hoped to enjoy regular tv again. I guess I expected too much. Seasons 1-3 are a ten. Season 4 not so much.",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2019,RottonNymph,10," This had been a bad dream....
","All I will say is, if this gets a season 5, Rob Thomas needs to make the first episode Veronica waking up from a real bad dream. As Logan has said ""Our love is epic"" he is a part of her. My heart is broken.This is crazy..WHY ????",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2019,Molly842017,6," Veronica Mars, great ensemble series - until it wasn't
","As a completely different show, Season 4 of Veronica Mars would be watchable. As a continuation of a established show, it was a discordant watch almost from the first episode.",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2019,douglasd-647-652772,2," I loved it & then I hated it!
","*SPOILER-ISH WARNING*
(Although I don't go into any details or tell you anything that happens I do express my thoughts on the show but more specifically the last episode of the new season 4. If you want to know what actually happens you'll have to watch or Google it. If you don't want any expectations going in you probably won't want to read this. If you're still interested keep reading.)",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2005,sarastro7,8," TV history in the making
","Veronica Mars is a fantastic show - the greatest since Twin Peaks. I feel very sorry for those who can't appreciate its incredible acting, suave and wry humor, amazingly detailed storytelling and hyper-complex characters. The massive amounts of angst and intensity among these high schoolers is the only unrealistic (or rather, surrealistic) aspect of the show, and it is forgiven because this is an superbly crafted exercise in stylized fiction and symbolism.",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2019,wimmer-62375,5," Here's What's Wrong w/ S4 (From The Perspective of a Professional Writer)
","I'm a writer and a writing coach, and as much as the ending of season 4 disappointed me as a fan and as a person whose favorite character is Logan, what I hated was all the betrayals of established and accepted formula for something other over something I agreed to through three seasons and a movie.",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2019,justine-sd-nagy,7," Really disappointed with ending of season 4
","I don't want to spoil it, but the ending really let me down. I just started watching this show and pretty much binged it before season 4 came out. Season 4 was only interesting because of this character and they kill him off? I feel like that was a bad move. And i am not sure if i will watch in the future.",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2008,peacexlovexand_harmonyba,10," dark and beautiful, Veronica mars is a witty and smart show for all ages
","Veronica Mars is a dark and poignant tribute to teenage angst and isolation. As a sophomore, we find Veronica popular and happy. She is dating the most popular guy in school, Duncan, and is best friends with Duncan's sister- the wild Lily Kane. After Lily's brutal and highly publicized murder, Veronica loses her friends, her social status all because she choose to stick by her father who accused Lily Kane's own father, the rich and beloved Jake Kane.",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2006,Sweet_Ophelia,10," Remarkable TV (season one review)
","Despite dismal ratings and crazy scheduling, in 2 short years 'Veronica Mars' has obtained a cult following... so what is all the fuss? Well, I'll tell you...",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2010,klanco,10," I can't believe I've waited this long......
","First time I've heard about this show was when I saw Kristen Bell in Heroes. I came here and saw VMars. It took me a long time before I decided to watch this show. I started to watch it for one reason and one reason only -> Kristen Bell. Stupid I know, but when I saw the pilot episode I knew that this show will be something new, something different, something worth watching and I was hooked. The is one of the best TV shows that my eyes have ever seen before. Smart and funny dialogs, beautiful and talented cast of the show, interesting twists,mysteries... This show has everything. This show is awesome but sadly it has been canceled for a long time now. I really wish that this show will return to screen as a new season or a movie.",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2018,catherineridout,10," This show was so ahead of its time
",I loved this show more than anything. It may or may not have had influence on me going to school to be a private investigator for some time. ,/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2006,ljs00b,," I can't believe I'm saying this...
","I hate being sucked in. More than anything. I avoid anything that's popular just because I can't stand the herd mentality. It took me three years before I touched a Harry Potter book. I would not have watched this show willingly. My one uplifting, redeeming quality is that I'm a good friend. Always. Even at the sacrifice of my Wednesday evenings. I originally started watching VM because I was taping it for a friend who didn't get UPN in her new town. I was just going to tape it, but I thought it would be nice if I cut the commercials for her. Now, half a season later...I can't stop watching it. It's horrible. I actually rented the entire first season and watched it in one twenty-four hour sitting. If you start watching this show, be warned you WILL get hooked, no matter how hard you try to resist. It is a great mystery. Each episode has its own mystery that is self inclusive, but the overall season mystery is what keeps you speeding through traffic to get home in time on Wednesday nights. Kudos to the creators, they did a great job!",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2006,kmylml,10," Are you kidding me?
","After reading quite a few comments from people who thought this show is ""horrible,"" I was really surprised with their reasons. First of all, there are very few TV shows out there that are in every way true to life. Of course the situations aren't completely plausible! That's why we watch TV shows in the first place - we're entertained by things that we would not normally do or see. If I wanted to watch something ""realistic"" I'd just tape myself and watch it at the end of the day.",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2011,realtvhrdbfq-1,10," Incredible!
","What is so incredible about Veronica Mars? Chemistry between characters, intelligently written script, never-ending sarcasm except a few moments. No.",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2019,jblippman-150-589854,3," Series finale is a disaster. SPOILERS.
",Writers made the worst mistake a series can make. Lazy writing and falling back on an old predictable trope. A heroine cannot have a happy personal life and still be a heroine.,/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2009,blulou2000,10," well i didn't see that coming.......
","This TV series follows the story of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell)as her best friend is murdered and her father is removed as county sheriff, Veronica dedicates her life to cracking the toughest mysteries in the affluent town of Neptune.",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2010,michawheeler,9," This show is fantastic...I urge you not to see it!
","I have just finished watching all three seasons of this show, and I have to say, I've had better times. I've been moping around the house all day reading reviews, watching (mostly bad) fan made videos and thinking about Veronica Mars and how I'll never see her again. This sounds awful but this is the worst break-up I've ever had, honestly it is!",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2011,copperncherrio,10," High school drama and mysteries at its best.
","WHY UPN?!? Granted, when I saw the previews for this show when it was on, I was like huh? and LAME (mainly because of the title). But upon viewing it from season one I realized my faults. The problem with Veronica Mars that it was too much for UPN to handle.",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2011,Pugalicious,10," I am obsessed with this show !
","I am obsessed with this show ! In my opioin this is the best show to ever be on T.V . I did not watch it while it was on T.V but it is on netflix so i can watch it 24/7 . I love this show so much i can quote it and name a lot of the episodes . This show is addicting I could not stop watching it ! If you don,t want to get hooked on it i would not try to watch it but this show is too amazing not to watch ! The combo of her crime solving and her teen life being in high school is wonderful . I still think that they should bring it back even though it has been off for around five years . I,m a super fan who thinks there should be a movie or really a forth season . The last episode kinda left you at a cliff hanger",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2005,SonicStuart,," UPN has potential with this show
","I have never watched any of the prime-time shows on UPN after Buffy the Vampire Slayer ended until I watched this show and I think that UPN has themselves a hit show here and the show is Veronica Mars. The show is about a smart, fearless 17-year-old girl named Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) who is an apprentice to her father, Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni from ""Just Shoot Me"") who is a former sheriff and has Veronica help him with his struggling new private investigator business. By sneaking through back alleys and scoping out no-tell motels with a telescopic-lens camera and her math book, Veronica attempts to uncover the California beach town's darkest secrets, including who killed her best friend and Duncan's sister, Lilly, and created a scandal that cost her father his job, his home and wife. Pushed to the edge of this multicultural, venomous little Peyton Place, Veronica Mars relentlessly continues to search for evidence that will clear her father's name and get her back into the ""in-crowd,"" but what she finds may tear the town of Neptune apart at the seams. The show I think is like those detective book novels almost. I like this show! I think Kristen Bell is going to be the next Sarah Michelle Gellar! This show premiered on UPN September 2004. I hope this show lasts more than one season!",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2005,Bagelcat,," Excellent - Not your average UPN show
",The story of Veronica and her search for the truth in the spoiled and famous Nepture is far more compelling that your average UPN teen drama.,/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was all geared up to love Veronica Mars and, surprise, I wound up disliking it. The bad: ",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2006,raindrop_chick,10," Not just another teen drama...
","Okay, I admit...when I first started watching VM, I didn't really expect much. However, one or two episodes in and I was totally hooked. I really enjoy the noir aspect of it, and the fact that is doesn't hold anything back in terms of ""real"" issues such as drugs, and sex. Of course, these issues are dealt with in a fictional way that makes them intriguing (as opposed to depressing) to watch.",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2014,ThomasDrufke,9," Sassiest and Wittiest Show Ever
","Here's a show that has been on my watchlist for years but never quite made it up the mantle. That is until a feature film was released this past March so I thought what better time to start the show than now. My girlfriend being a huge fan definitely helped a bit as well. Veronica Mars is just about one of the coolest characters of all time. This review sounds very unintelligent by making such claims, but seriously the girl kicks a**. The third season was wrongfully cut short and 7 years later a movie is released. I have yet to see the film but I have been told it does the series and it's characters justice. As long as it sticks to what make each of these characters so lovable, then I'm sure it will be excellent.",/review/rw3141739/?ref_=tt_urv
