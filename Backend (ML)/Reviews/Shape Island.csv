26 November 2001,pc_dean,9," Black and White and Gray All Over
","Billy Bob Thornton has the perfect face for film noir.  His craggy, drawn features lead up to sunken but large and staring eyes, and cheeks that look to be made out of plaster.  Particularly when shot in black and white, his face becomes a landscape of shifting shadows, while he doesn't move a muscle.  He is able to give the impression of a man at war with himself even while sitting perfectly still and staring ahead.  He's Jeremy Irons, only without that unsettling accent.  The Coen brothers take great advantage of their stars' granite physiognomy throughout ""The Man That Wasn't There,"" constructing several shots around Thornton staring into a point just slightly away from the camera, impassive as an Easter Island head, moving only to smoke an ever-present cigarette while the obligatory noir voice-over narration runs.  His voice is perfect, too: a kind of calm, measured rumbling, which describes incredible events but never seems amazed by them. Thornton says ""I don't talk much,"" and it's true: he doesn't do much either, but he is still fascinating, and commands our attention.",/review/rw4633165/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2001,Quinoa1984,10," one of the Coen brothers best, a film that becomes a masterpiece after a while.
","Joel and Ethan Coens' The Man Who Wasn't There doesn't (how could it) top their first film-noir classic Blood Simple, but it is still an incredibly stylish and acted with pizazz type of film which should definitely get better with multiple viewings. Billy Bob Thornton turns in another top shelve job (geniusly subtle, even for him) as a quiet and observant barber named Ed, who gets drawn into an unfortunate string of events with his wife (Frances McDormand) who has cheated on him with Big Dave (James Gandolfini who in his scattered minutes on the screen shows his ability for Oscar nomination-type work) and with the usual line of events that would come from a noir comes compelling characters and set-pieces that show's Ed in a downfall though it is from a life the never wanted to lead in the first place. If Sartre decided to throw out the politics and religion and stick to the being and nothingness and write a hard-boiled novel, this might be it.",/review/rw4633165/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2001,jotix100,10," Brilliant Billy Bob Thornton
","What a difference a good director makes! Billy Bob Thornton, who was sadly misused in Bandits, gets to recover himself in his brilliant characterization of Ed Crane in this film directed by Joel Coen. His performance is so detailed and subtle that he uses his face to great advantage in the close-ups while the narration goes on in the background. The use of black and white heightens the atmosphere of this 40s-style film noir. The brilliant cinematography is incredible in the use of shadows and dark tones that enhances the story to such an extent. Frances McDormand is incredible in the film as well. And what could one say about James Gandolfini? He gets better and better all the time. The atmosphere of the era is captured even in the small details. It's very refreshing to see the Coen brothers get over their last disaster of ""State and Main"" with such panache, aided of course by their star, Billy Bob Thornton and the ensemble cast and a great and ironic story.",/review/rw4633165/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8," Great neo-noir film by the Coen brothers
","I haven't seen too many films by the Coen brothers(Ethan and Joel Coen)... in fact, this and Intolerable Cruelty are the only ones I've seen. I decided to see this after hearing many positive things about it, and finding out that it's a tribute to the old 'noir' films of the 40's and 50's. I love noir films, and neo-noir films are often great as well. So I decided to see this film, and I'm am very happy that I did. The plot is great... something that we all can relate to, and yet very recognizable for noir... which is quite impressive, since many noir films suffer from the plot being of limited appeal(the P.I./detective who gets *the* case, etc.). The pacing is excellent. I wasn't bored for a second. The atmosphere of the film is great... very dark and moody, even in the humor. The acting is great... Thornton, McDormand, Gandolfini, Johansson, Shalhoub... everyone is great. Billy Bob Thornton's character is easy to relate to(who hasn't felt that their life wasn't going anywhere, at one point?) and his narration as well as flawless performance is part of what makes the film noir... his character talks very little, but the voice-over and his subtle acting(which includes very little dialog) is great and he carries the movie perfectly. The characters are all well-written... there was only a short period where I didn't entirely understand a characters actions, but this was more because I hadn't thought that much about this particular character than a lack of credibility, character-wise. The story is great... it has some very interesting twists, and it holds your interest and entertains you for the entire run-time of about 1 hour and 45 minutes. The humor is good, but there is fairly little of it in the film(considering that this is what the Coen's are well-known for... well, part of it, anyway) but all of it fits perfectly. Much of it is dark, like the rest of the film. I watched this on a DVD which I borrowed from the library, and when I was about to start the film, I noticed that there were two disks... one in black/white, and one in color. I thought for a while, considered which would be better, but then I remembered that this is a homage to noir films... and, possibly more importantly, the directors intention is to make something that looks as if it could have come from that period where those films were at the peak of popularity... and why would I want to go against the directors intention on a film? That would negate the very point of watching it. All in all, if you're a fan of the Coen brothers directorial style or neo-noir/film noir, you'll most likely love it as much as I did. If not, maybe you can just enjoy the great acting and atmosphere. And if not that, the film probably just isn't for you. I recommend it to any fan of the Coen brothers and of film noir/neo-noir. Fans of any of the actors might also like it. Just be prepared; it is quite dark, and many will not like it simply for that. If you believe you can sit through this film, you definitely should consider it. 8/10",/review/rw4633165/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm sorry, but I like my black and white black and white - ESPECIALLY in a film that sets out to be the most pure film noir of all.  The shadows should be, simply, black, not black tinted with dark green.  The greys should be, simply, grey, not pearl grey or slate grey or any of the other shades of paint-catalogue grey that are the result (I presume) of trying to make a black and white film without using any actual black and white film.  I don't know the precise technological explanation; I do know that the film would be at least twice as good if the Coens would simply take the master print and transfer it to whatever material they use when they screen, say, ""Double Indemnity"".  This is not hyperbole.",/review/rw4633165/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2001,crow-13,," an interesting contribution to the Coen's ouvre
","I found this to be a pretty interesting film by the Coens'.  I was well aware of the ability to do noir, as evidenced by 'Blood Simple', as well as many-layered, dialogue-driven narratives as in 'Miller's Crossing.'  But what I found intriging about this movie was that it was about inconsequence. Billy Bob Thornton's character, Ed Crane, is similar to William H. Macy's in 'Fargo.'  Both have unsatisfying positions in lowly lives.  Both had received their jobs by ""marrying"" into them- Ed at the  Barber Shop, and William's at the car dealership.  The difference is, whereas the kidnapping plot is sought out in ""Fargo"", the blackmailing plot falls into Ed's lap by sheer choice (luck? fate?)",/review/rw4633165/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2001,nunculus,," What kind of a man are you?
","It starts as another Coenian postmod pastichey picaresque: Noir Guy (Billy Bob Thornton), a barber, has a souse of a wife (Frances McDormand, floridly cast ""against type"") who loves bingo and her boss at work, a scheming fat man named Big Dave (James Gandolfini). When a comically inept con man (Jon Polito) comes to town, wanting to find a partner in a new business called ""dry cleaning,"" we can see the signs a block away: Blackmail, best-laid-plans, murder ahead. The emphasis in this extremely academic take--more academic even than the Ph.Dish MILLER'S CROSSING--is on the sociological and political roots of noir. The postwarness, the cold-warness, the sunshine-boomtownness of the movie's mythical Santa Rosa (the location of SHADOW OF A DOUBT--but really, it's just early-Ellroy L.A.) are all underlined and double-underlined.",/review/rw4633165/?ref_=tt_urv

","Besides being great stuff for film maniacs who like to debate the technical aspects, the cinematography or the artistic ideas and influences in it, 'The Man Who Wasn't There' is also a great film. One of my all-time favorites. The sort of film where the best possible choice of cast plays even the most insignificant walk-on role. The Coens' signature in there: being visually very conscious, especially for their film noir venture, they must have spent a huge amount of time to find the best possible faces for every single shot. Not necessary to waste words on how well they did in their choices for the lead roles. Fortunately these 'faces' they collected can also act, everyone does incredibly well here.",/review/rw4633165/?ref_=tt_urv

","Aficionados of classic film noir will find this 21st century evocation of the style absolutely captivating right from the start as stunning cinematography, an uneasy atmosphere and a plot in which adultery, blackmail and murder are featured, all provide early indications of how meticulously the look and content of the piece have been created. Its story about a man who makes an error of judgement that sends his life into a downward spiral will, of course, be familiar to noir fans but in this case, the adverse consequences are so far-reaching that they also go on to devastate the lives of a number of other key characters as well.",/review/rw4633165/?ref_=tt_urv

","Man Who Wasn't There is lost out of the gate. It's much clearer the second time you view it. It flits between 10 different incompatible story lines, and can't figure out a way to develop any of them. It goes nowhere. Many viewers were tricked into thinking this movie matters due to its cinematography (It looks nice) and by the authors (The Coens continue to receive unearned accolades). It's a bunch of Noir posturing/noodling with scenes designed to kill time, not add up. It drifts and drifts and drifts. It's a catalog of half-hearted, half-developed ideas, so it begins to feel like it's running long after only 20 minutes. Who can tell what they set out to explore? A viewer will never figure out why it was brought into existence because the Coens have not imbued it with any sense of purpose.

16 May 2002,auberus,7," A beautifully shot ""Film Noir"" in black and white but with colorful characters
","The 2002 Cohen brothers film is a delight. ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" combines everything I like in the Coen brother's unique way of telling a story. From the comic of the situation witnessed in the famous ""O Brother Where Art Though"" (2000) to the originality of the scenario seen in ""Barton Fink"" (1991), not to mention the singularity of the characters and their lack of control over the situation in the excellent ""Fargo"" (1996), all those ""hints"" have been gathered to built this well thought story. Joel and Ethan directed and wrote this picture about a bored and boring chain-smoking barber admirably played by Billy Bob Thornton (best role for this under-rated actor)who blackmails his wife's boss and lover for money to invest in dry cleaning. As you sense the plan goes terribly wrong. I believe this story is a pretext to show us how little is our grip on the reality of our lives. And to demonstrate how justice easily becomes a comico-pathetic masquarade when given by men. On the contrary true Justice eventually lies in the wrinkles of men's destiny. As a conclusion you are better off expecting a landing of an alien spaceship than a fair and clear trial in a court of law. Whether we agree or not to this demonstration, it does not take away the pleasure of watching these terrific actors putting into play the original and dark scenario of the two brothers. Billy Bob Thornton is a master portraying to perfection Ed Crane (the laconic barber). Since Dead Man (1995) I don't recall a lot of movies where directors have capitalized on his enormous talent. Frances McDormand (Doris Crane) is as usual fantastic. We remember her in Wonder Boys (2000) and of course as the sheriff in Fargo (1996). Here she plays wonderfully the barber's wife going from bitterness to sorrow. Some characters can be seen as ""cliche"" like Freddy Riedenschneider the lawyer played by the good Tony Shalhoub, however they are all enjoyable to watch: James Gandolfini is terrific as ""Big Dave"" and Jon Polito very colorful as Creighton Tolliver, not to forget the very talkative and sincere Michael Badalucco as Franck Raffo or the great job done by Scarlett Johansson in the role of Rachael 'Birdy' Abundas the not very straight and quiet adolescent you would expect. The Black and White picture is more an artistic exploration from the Coen brothers and I don't think has anything to do with the chosen period (late 40's). However the black and white picture is very well shot by Roger Deakins and impose tremendously well Billy Bob Thornton's character and therefore never becomes a burden for the audience. ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" does not belong to any genre in particular. The Movie is made of a myriads of genres and characters that the Coen brothers have managed to master throughout their career of story tellers. The movie is a ""film Noir"" but not only, it is a dark comedy but not only, it is a light thriller but not only, it is shot in black and white but still have colorful characters, it tells a simple story of a laconic barber but there is more to it, eventually Justice will prevail but not the way we think it will. In the end it is a unique movie and in times where everything seems to look the same this movie becomes a true jewel.",/review/rw4633165/?ref_=tt_urv

17 May 2004,mrcaw1,10," Small gem of a film.......
","The Coen Brothers are arguably the best film makers working today and this film proves it once again. Shot in black & white the film follows seamlessly in the tradition of the classic film noirs that came before it and adds its own Coensian twist. The performances are top notch with a stand out by lead Billy Bob Thorton. The movie should have been nominated for Best Picture! What's wrong with these Academy Members anyway???? Instead A Beautiful Mind (HUGELY overrated) grabbed its spot. As for the noms for Best Actor in a lead role that year, overrated performances by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe robbed Thorton of his nomination. The Man Who Wasn't There is stylish and beautifully paced, wrapping it's timing around a bit of classical music from Bethoven that's played throughout the movie. Also a nice chance to see an early performance by up and coming Scarlett Johansson in a small but important part. Could quite possibly top my list of favorite Coen Brothers Movies.",/review/rw4633165/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2002,Infofreak,," Good but not great. Being a Coen brothers movie that means a slight disappointment.
","I've never seen a Coen brothers movie that I didn't like, but for me 'The Man Who Wasn't There' is their most disappointing picture since 'The Hudsucker Proxy'. Some have criticized the slow deliberate pacing of this film noir homage, that I didn't have a problem with. I just thought the movie, while entertaining enough, added very little to the genre. Anyone who has read some James M. Cain will pretty much be able to see where this one is headed within the first half hour, but being the Coens, I expected some wildly original twist or subversion of the style, but it never came. After all, this is not exactly fresh territory for them. Their brilliant debut back in the 80s 'Blood Simple' was a modern version of classic noir, and more recently their best known movie 'Fargo' covered similar themes and situations as this one. Both those movies were more engrossing than 'The Man Who Wasn't There' for me. Billy Bob Thornton is by far the best thing about this movie. Yet another brilliant performance from him. The rest of the supporting cast are all good, especially Jon Polito, a Coen regular since 'Miller's Crossing', who plays a very shifty salesman. But while I enjoyed much about this movie, it really didn't hit the heights I was hoping for. A good movie, but not a great one, and as the Coens are capable of making such original and eclectic movies as 'Barton Fink' and 'The Big Lebowski', that makes it a bit of a disappointment for me.",/review/rw4633165/?ref_=tt_urv

Sure, their films are a lot of fun, but they generally end up as nothing more than an entertaining joke.
