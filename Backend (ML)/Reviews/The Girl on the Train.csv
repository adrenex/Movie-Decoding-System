27 March 2016,Reznik_T,8," I have no idea why Superman Returns has such a bad reputation. This is actually really-really good!
","I was totally surprised and blown away by this movie! First of all, Superman Returns takes you back to the original cinematic universe of Superman 1 and 2. When the movie started and I realized that, I was pretty skeptic, I didn't believe that it could work 26 years after Superman 2 (actually it was 36 years, when I was watching it). Then when Clark Kent returned to the Daily Planet, and I saw that the actor (Brandon Routh) is actually doing Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent, I was like ""Oh no, this will be bad!"". The same thing with the young photographer, Jimmy Olsen - the actor was playing the exact same character. I didn't like the concept. But then I said to myself, okay, I'm gonna go with it, so I kept watching the movie, and very shortly I had to realize that it actually works! It was funny, it was exciting, it was emotional - it was everything that a classical Superman movie needs to be! Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane was amazing! She was actually not trying to copy Margot Kidder, she was doing her own thing, but still remained Lois Lane. I would say, as far as acting goes, Kate Bosworth was the best thing in this movie.",/review/rw1692553/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2020,pawanpunjabithewriter,6," Not bad!
","The movie experience wasn't bad enough. It had some good moments. However, yes, it's not one of the most spectacular films. The reason I wanted to watch is I want to enjoy Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Justice League to the fullest. You can do that too, as I'm sure this won't completely disappoint you. It was a little dark, but pacy enough and not slow. The movie wasn't spectacular but Brandon Ruth definitely was. The story was on the average side, however, since it had its moments, it can't be considered poor!",/review/rw1692553/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2020,jeremycrimsonfox,8," Underrated Film That Sticks To The Formila
","Superman Returns is an underrated film. Made 19 years after the box office bomb that is Superman IV: The Quest For Peace, the film sees Superman return to Earth after being gone for five years due to hearing about a discovery of Krypton's remains. Because of this, Lex Luthor is released from prison due to him not appearing in court to testify against him, and Lois Lane has a kid. The man of steel returns to protecting Metropolis and tries to adjust to how the world changed, as Lex manages to break into Fortress of Solitude and steal Kryptonian crystals for use in a new sinister plan.",/review/rw1692553/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2019,barbell_28,9," This movie deserves better.....much better.
","Ok, so i dont understand all the hate for this installment of the Superman franchise. The acting is great, the visual effects are beautiful, there is tons of action, and i like the story, it was the basic superman formula, but why not....it works. Kevin spacey played a great villain, Brandon Routh summoned Chris Reeves on this one and deserves more credit than he ever received. I grew up in the era of the Chris Reeves Superman and i find this to be the next best thing. Personally if you seen this movie when it 1st came out and thought you didnt like it, give it another chance, it is a great film.",/review/rw1692553/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2010,TheLittleSongbird,6," Solid, yes; spectacular, no
","There have been critics who have been stinting in their praise for this movie, but others were quite condescending. This film is far from a masterpiece, and definitely not the best of the Superman franchise, but it was fairly solid considering what it could've been. First off, visually it looks amazing and I thought the special effects were extremely good. Same with the music score, full of those familiar motifs and some new haunting ones too. While Lex Luthor wasn't portrayed as the cold, shrewd yet somewhat lovable villain Gene Hackman played so memorably in the original movies, Kevin Spacey the competent actor he is played him very well. Also Bryan Singer's direction was able and had just the right edge, and I was intrigued by the film's concept. And I have to say, some of the action scenes were very exhilarating. However, there were elements that could've been better. One of the main problems I had with the film was the pace, I found it unusually slow and there are scenes like Clark listening in on Lois and Jason that dragged on for too long. And maybe I am in the minority who felt that it could've been half an hour shorter, and that the script was clunky at times. Also, I wasn't taken with the two leads either. Brandon Routh is handsome and he is charming but he isn't charismatic enough as Clark Kent/Superman, and Kate Bosworth left me cold as Lois. In regard to these two, the relationship between the two characters was underdeveloped. All in all, a solid and visually enthralling film, but it is let down by uneven pacing and a clunky script. 6/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw1692553/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2006,dr_foreman,5," Super? Nope - just decent.
","""Superman Returns"" is a competent movie, generally very well produced, directed and cast. But it didn't quite gel for me. I thought it dragged at points, as Superman got bogged down with pining over Lois Lane instead of saving the day. Alas, I thought the dialogue just wasn't sharp enough to sustain these heavy-handed emotional scenes; what sort of catchphrase is ""I'm always around,"" anyway? ",/review/rw1692553/?ref_=tt_urv

19 July 2020,abcizdaman,10," Not Enough Kudos
","In my opinion this was the best Superman movie put out to date. A great story, and a great cast. Brandon Routh was perfect for the Clark Kent/Superman role and Kevin Spacey was superb as Lex, ever comical in an evil way. The only thing I didn't like was the feeling I got while they were all beating Superman up. But yes I got chills when the movie started in the theater when they played the intro, the same intro theme as the old Superman movies from the 80s.. great decision. The story was comical, meaningful, and involved. Great special effects and everything else. This was just an all around feel good movie. Much better than Man of Steel in my opinion though Man of Steel was entertaining. If you've never seen this before, give it a chance. Maybe you'll like it.

23 July 2006,cosmic_quest,8," The world does need Superman!
","Like many other people, the character of Superman has always been a firm favourite of mine dating back to my childhood. Christopher Reeve's Superman made me believe a man could fly with the light-hearted 'Lois and Clark' series seeing me through the Nineties. I was sceptical as the next Supes fan when I heard they were to bring back the character, recast and revitalised for a twenty-first century audience. But having seen 'Superman Returns', those fears were instantly pushed back as I now eagerly await a sequel.",/review/rw1692553/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2006,disdressed12,6," a bit of a letdown
","considering the hype for this movie,i thought it would be better than it was.it wasn't a horrible movie,but i don't think it lived up to the Superman name.Brandon Routh as Superman,looked a lot like Christopher Reeve,maybe a bit too much.his mannerisms were also too much like Reeve,as if he were trying to emulate him,when instead he should have been trying to put his own stamp on the character.Kate Bosworth was okay as Loise lane,but Kevin Spacey was an inspired choice as Lex Luthor.i also liked Frank Langella as Perry White.however,i could have done without James Marsden as Richard White,especially since his role was so small it was pointless.the other problem i had with the movie is that it tended to lag at times,causing my attention to wander.this movie just didn't have the impact of a movie like spider man or even any of the x-men films.it just didn't have as much substance as it could have.if you've yet to see this movie,keep your expectations low and maybe you won't be overly disappointed. 6/10",/review/rw1692553/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2006,b_flic,5," Strong Potential/Weak Execution!
","Bryan Singer has made it no secret that he was going to make this film a sequel of sorts to the first two Superman films which starred Christopher Reeve. Which I though was an interesting idea even though I thought Superman 2 was lame. However, I thought the premise of Superman returning after a long absence was a great idea, unfortunately Singer's heavy reliance on the first two films really crippled this film.",/review/rw1692553/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2006,baumer,6," A mild disappointment
","Watching Superman and Superman II on the weekend, the first time in quite some time, I could finally see how the special effects were accomplished. Superman flew against blue screen to make it look like he was flying over the water and through the air and so on. Fire coming towards him was nothing more than an optical illusion and so on. But in 1978, these were ground breaking effects and people marveled at the wizardry displayed in the film. But the special effects never seemed to take away from the story. Superman II is a better film in my opinion because there was more action, more human relationships and a lot more actual physical confrontations/fights. That's not to say that Superman the movie isn't a great film, it is. But the second showed us every side to Superman. His angry side, his vengeful side, his soft side and his human side. The whole film was simply kick-ass. And part of that equation was the casting and the interpretation of the characters. If there is on complaint that is omnipotent in this film, it's that the characters do not resemble the characters we remember. Ironically, the actor that had the most heat on him before the film began, has the best performance in the film. Brandon Routh embodies the spirit of Superman but needs a better script to showcase his talents. It's the rest of the cast that seems to sleepwalk their way through the film.",/review/rw1692553/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2007,dfranzen70,7," Not Super, not Stupid, just a hair above average
","Superman's back and there's gonna be trouble, hey na, hey na, Superman's back! Well, hey, if Batman can begin again, Supes can come back to Earth, so to speak, right? Only this time it's not the late Christopher Reeve or even George Reeves, it's relative newcomer Brandon Routh as the Man o' Steel. Seems he's been gone lo these past five years in deep space, checking the general vicinity of where Krypton once existed. (Astronomers reported they'd found traces of the planet, so off Superman went to check out his home; oddly, neither he nor the astronomers mentioned that he was leaving.) But now he's back, and so is, coincidentally, Clark Kent. After reunited with his Earth mom Martha (Eva Marie Saint), Clark returns to work at the Daily Planet, greeted enthusiastically by Jimmy Olson ( ) and less enthusiastically by Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who's really moved on. Seems Lois has fallen in love, gotten married, and given birth, all five years ago. Huh, how about that. Her hubby is now an assistant editor at the Planet and is conveniently the nephew of Perry White, played by the magnificent Frank Langella.",/review/rw1692553/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2015,moviemattb,9," Why The World Needs To Give Superman Returns Another Look
","This was my first movie to see Superman on the big screen, before I saw ""Man of Steel"" when it came out seven years later. I never saw any of the old films in theaters, but only saw them on TV. After when this movie came out, critics enjoyed it, audience have mixed feelings, and sadly didn't go well at the box-office which it all leads up to another reboot instead of a making a sequel. So, does this movie hold up or does it really deserves to be forgotten? Here it goes: the movie acts as a sequel to the first two movies, while it ignores Lester's concept for ""Superman II"" and ignoring the third and fourth movie. However, the movie takes place in modern time, instead of taking place in the late 70s or early 80s. Furthermore, it tells about Superman making his return from searching the remaining of his home world Krypton as he has been gone for five years, while Lex Luthor is wanting to destroy Superman and creating ""land"" of his own. Also, Lois Lane has moved on from Superman as she wrote the article which it completely shocks Superman for her receiving a Pulitzer Prize on her work called ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman."" So, how is that movie? As much as I love ""Man of Steel,"" and I am glad that its getting a sequel; but at the same time, I wish if this movie got a sequel. There are possible reasons on why this movie failed because of either the movie wasn't marketed really well; it is due to other movies that came out the same date as this or probably is that everyone in this world weren't ready for having Superman to be brought back, because of ""Batman Begins"" came out a year before this came out in 2006. I guess people weren't ready to see another ""Superman"" movie, because they were very much in the mood for having Batman to come back. Also, a 6.1 on IMDb is really low, which I think is unfairly treated, and I think the movie just needs a little love. I know ""Man of Steel"" got a 7.2, which its good; so, why can't this one have a good rating like ""Man of Steel"" or the other two good ""Superman"" movies? Just saying. I don't think this movie deserve the hate it gets. I remember that Bryan Singer just drop off to direct the third ""X-Men"" movie, so he can direct this one instead. I know he wants to direct the third ""X-Men"" movie, but Fox just ended up not being patience so they can make the movie without him as Brett Ratner directs it instead. Difficult choice, if I may say so. Anyway, I will admit that the premise of the movie feels similar to Richard Donner's movie like Lex Luthor wants billions of people to die. You think they should at least try something new and different. Also, which its a minor nitpick, I don't mind Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane but they could at least find someone better to play Lois Lane. She is like the equivalent of Katie Holmes from ""Batman Begins"" because she looks slightly young to play the role. Nevertheless, I thought she did a fine job, but could of been someone better to play Lois Lane. Also, compare to ""Man of Steel,"" the movie may have some fine action scenes but I wish if it had more action scenes so the filmmakers don't have to stick by the books on making a traditional ""Superman"" movie like the others. So those are my only issues with the movie. What is good? I thought Bryan Singer's direction was actually really, and has a very unique to style on how he wants this movie to be. Aside from Bosworth, the rest of the cast all did good. I thought Kevin Spacey makes an excellent Lex Luthor, but also updating from the role that Gene Hackman played originally. For Brandon Routh, I thought the look of him for not only looking like the part for playing both Clark Kent and Superman, but that he looks very much like Christopher Reeve. He really does give an outstanding performance, and was able to channel the role very wisely. The special effects are really good, which that takes care of the lame FX from ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace."" I do appreciate some of the nods to the original movies by Donner like having Marlon Brando as Jor-El, its wondrous moments, and of course, hearing the theme song by John Williams. John Ottman's score is very well done for paying respect to Williams' score and making new material on his own. I wasn't bored by the movie as it goes at a good pace, and I did get teary eye from the part that Superman gets beat up Luthor's men as it makes me think of Jesus getting whipped by the Romans. Of course, other comic book movies may have some religious aspects like what this movie did. I do like where Superman tells Lois, when he says that she wrote the article that doesn't need a savior, but he hears everyday when people are crying for one which that many Christians will feel about that. With that said, I think ""Superman Returns"" deserves another look, and I do think its close enough to be as underrated as ""Man of Steel."" I enjoy it, and I'm giving it a 9 out of 10.",/review/rw1692553/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2006,Derek237,7," Why the world needs Superman...
","The basic premise of Superman Returns is that Superman has returned from an unexplained 5-year absence to find a world that seems to be getting along fine without him, that the woman he loves has moved on and has a family, and that he is- at least in terms of any beings similar to him- completely alone. The amazing thing is, this is the least angst-filled, least melodramatic superhero film in the past 5 years or so. I think the recent trend has been to try to get audiences to empathize with their heroes more by making them more human and actually taking them seriously. Peter Parker battles some very serious demons and is in constant struggle with being Spider-man, the X-Men films are very serious and political and the latest instalment, ""The Last Stand,"" featured some startling and emotionally wrenching revelations, and Batman, well, need I go on?

This film out of all the films that were released from 2000 to 2010 do not match the amount of heart and soul of this film. Batman Begins (2005) does come close.
