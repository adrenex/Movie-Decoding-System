26 October 2021,deloudelouvain,7," Nice easy to watch adventure movie.
","If you like adventure movies like Indiana Jones, Romancing The Stone, Jewel Of The Nile, Jumanji and others in this genre you can't go wrong with Jungle Cruise. It's the same entertainment, a bit over the top, not always making sense, but that's hardly the point with these kind of movies. It's just a bit of fun. To me it's very relaxing to watch these kind of popcorn movies. The Rock or Dwayne Johnson might not be the greatest actor but I think he fits in this genre. He's okay to watch in non serious movies. Emily Blunt did a good job as well as did the rest of the cast. The CGI's were more than decent, they clearly had a big budget for these parts in the movie. Jungle Cruise is perfect to watch as a family movie or if you're just a big fan of easy adventure.",/review/rw7192412/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2021,Hollywood_Yoda,8," Jumanji Meets Pirates of the Caribbean
","Jungle Cruise was more of a movie than I could have anticipated, it was much better than expected. Dwayne Johnson plays Frank, a steamboat captain who resembles Humphrey Bogart, which I believe was done purposefully. The story and settings made me think of a movie mashup of Jumanji and Pirates of the Caribbean. The only thing missing was Johnny Depp, but with his current legal issues, he may not be in too many Disney films going forward. Time will tell.",/review/rw7192412/?ref_=tt_urv

",Jungle Cruise is an adaptation of a Disney Park ride that I can barely remember going to and I have been to both Disney parks in the USA.,/review/rw7192412/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2021,tavm,7," Jungle Cruise was pretty enjoyable for what it was
","Partly inspired by Raiders of the Lost Ark and The African Queen as well as the Disney Parks' famous ride this movie is named after, Jungle Cruise is way too much exposition though things are kept hopping during most of its running time. Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt (along with the person playing the latter's brother) take us on a mostly enjoyable ride to whatever they're looking for. My movie theatre-working friend enjoyed this much more than I did but I liked it fine for what it was. Some of the most enjoyable parts were Johnson's corny puns. So that's a partial recommendation of Jungle Cruise.",/review/rw7192412/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2021,HunterSmith_WriteCinemaForLife,8," Disney delivers a mostly swinging comeback during pandemic times.
","Jungle Cruise is a delightfully fun adventure film that finds a compelling, if uneven, swing between old-fashioned adventure cinema and the modern blockbuster mechanics of films like Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle or the post-Pirates of the Caribbean crusades from Disney. Dwayne Johnson is as charming as ever, and assisting him are the company of Emily Blunt and Jack Whitehall. Blunt has been apparently finding her path in Hollywood with well-crafted popcorn entertainment and more thoughtful films like A Quiet Place; I certainly hope she continues to go down this path of success.",/review/rw7192412/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2021,SnoopyStyle,6," a fine ride
","For 400 years, men have been searching the Amazon to find the Tears of the Moon, the flower petals of a legendary tree which can cures any illness or curse. It's 1916 London. Siblings Lily (Emily Blunt) and MacGregor Houghton (Jack Whitehall) steal an arrowhead artifact from the Royal Society. It's the key to finding the tree. They are pursued by the ruthless Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons). They hire a boat skippered by Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson). Joachim reawakens cursed Spanish conquistadors led by Aguirre (Edgar Ram√≠rez).",/review/rw7192412/?ref_=tt_urv

","A simple Disney adventure story with a lot of heart. Yes, the events in the film are preposterous, but they fit with the world that is created, it fits with the type of 'product' this film is. Watch it with your kid(s) - they'll love it. Just turn off the adult cinema critic in you.",/review/rw7192412/?ref_=tt_urv

21 December 2021,planktonrules,3," Just turn off your brain and enjoy...though that might be tough.
","""Jungle Cruise"" is a recent Disney movie that was released to theaters and Disney+. I saw it on Disney+ and am sure it would have MOSTLY looked better on the big screen. I say 'mostly' because some of the visuals are amazing and would have looked great...but there also were a few CGI sequences that would have looked worse on the big screen because they look dated...such as the jaguar and the snakes...all of which look fake.",/review/rw7192412/?ref_=tt_urv

",It's a movie that if you go into it expecting an adventure movie with a standard generic plot. Absolutely amazing!! Emily and DJ's pairing is perfection!! They're so funny together and when the romance scenes happened it progressed so naturally. Dwayne Johnson never ever dissapointed us in his every movie. That's why he is only one who is highest paid actor.,/review/rw7192412/?ref_=tt_urv

","There's a line of dialog in the 1989 movie ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death"" (seriously, you can look it up right here on IMDb) that goes - ""This is not the Disneyland Jungle Boat Ride""! It would have been cool if Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson) said that he and his passengers weren't headed for the Avocado Jungle of Death, but besides me, who else would have ever heard of it?",/review/rw7192412/?ref_=tt_urv

","A darling cast and a unique storyline make Jungle Cruise a charming movie. There are a few flaws and it's definitely a bit long. But, it's visually spectacular, had a good mix of humor and action, and leading lady Emily Blunt has never been better. A wonderful movie experience.",/review/rw7192412/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2021,BA_Harrison,2," Jungle Crud
","I love jungle adventure films, and I like Dwayne Johnson, but Disney's Jungle Cruise is a perilous journey into mega-budget awfulness, director Jaume Collet-Serra unsuccessfully steering this wreck of a movie into turbulent waters with a messy script that lurches awkwardly from one CGI-drenched scene to another.",/review/rw7192412/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2021,Dunkaccino,6," Entertaining for sure, but nothing special

3 August 2021,masonsaul,7," Really good action adventure film
","Undermined by CG that whilst mostly impressive, definitely has its weak moments especially in the third act and a bizarre twist, Jungle Cruise is still a really good action adventure film that's fun, funny and reasonably thrilling. Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt are both great with perfect chemistry. Jesse Plemons and Jack Whitehall are both really good. Jaume Collet-Serra's direction is great, it's well filmed and well paced. The music by James Newton Howard is also really good.",/review/rw7192412/?ref_=tt_urv
