24 August 2000,Tito-8,," One of the best shows ever
","Even though I watch too much television, it's rare for me to become addicted to any show.  This is a rare exception.  Season one is now over, and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.  It's already one of my favorite programs of all-time, and even though I have doubts about how much I will like the next ""Survivor"" season, I'll always remember the first season as genuinely entertaining (and at times, riveting) television.",/review/rw7197696/?ref_=tt_urv

","Just watched Ep. 11 and recently this show is about people just talking about who they're going to vote off. Less than 10 minutes is devoted to an actual competitions. What are they 'surviving"" ? They're certainly not alone on the island . There are film crews following them all over.",/review/rw7197696/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2003,Jdc102,," Fresh and Exciting..One of the best editions of Survivor Yet.
",For some reason it seems that the odd numbered survivor seasons aren't as good (Except for Season 1 of course).  Example: Africa- The scenery was boring and some of the cast was interesting but overall it wasn't anything great.  Thailand-  Probably the worst ever.  The location was good but the cast was the worst yet. But FINALLY that curse has ended because PEARL ISLANDS is Great.,/review/rw7197696/?ref_=tt_urv

5 May 2010,endura-1,10," I'm addicted
","what can i say about this show that hasn't been already said? it is perfect. entertainment, fun, psychology, beautiful surroundings...there is one thing however that often puzzles me. i recently read an interview with jeff probst (the host of the show) and he said that contestants are not allowed any cosmetics etc. on the show. well, how come girls always have they eyebrows perfectly shaped, no sign of hair on their legs or intimate areas and head locks look washed and clean? it's been puzzling me for a while.castaways don't look the part. also why so many beautiful people? i understand the show must sell and probably whoever is responsible for casting must comply with that rule but at the same time the show seems less real because of that.i would really like to see normal people with cellulite and other flaws some time.other than that i wholeheartedly recommend it. hope the show will go on for as long as i'll be able to watch it.",/review/rw7197696/?ref_=tt_urv

",I watched big brother and stomached through most of the season until all was left was the cookout. It was such a boring watch. I didn't care who won. I told myself that Survivor will make up for a disappointing Big Brother season. NOPE.,/review/rw7197696/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2000,doug_funnie,," Awesome!
","CBS hit it big with this show. ""Survivor"" was the best show of Summer 2000, probably the best show of 2000 all together. It was all anyone was talking about. I never missed an episode and each week was amazing! There were twists and turn at every end, you had no idea who was going to get voted off or win the million! The show is so great, from the games, to the interviews, to the voting, which was always the best! An amazing show that will go down in television history! I can't wait for Survivor II.",/review/rw7197696/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2021,smileyprice-46006,1," This season. Is the worst.
",Been a fan loving this show. No words this season. Only 2 shows in and no thank you. These aren't survivor contestants. We've waited so long. And we're routtung for these people? Nope.,/review/rw7197696/?ref_=tt_urv

6 June 2022,melmerbyben,1," 1 Star since Season 41 & 42
","I've looked fwd to Survivor every season since the beginning. Watching every minute of each episode. Since Season 41 & 42, I could care less about the show. These last 2 seasons have been complete garbage and its really too bad. If Season 43 is anything like these seasons, I'll be saying goodbye to Survivor and not waste my time on it.",/review/rw7197696/?ref_=tt_urv

","I gave it 5 out of 10 because of the years past. But this show has become way too woke. I don't need a lecture each week about gay pride, ME TOO, my pronouns, and other social issues. I'm sure if season 41 ever airs Critical RACE theory will creep into the cast. Bye bye Survivor you had a nice run.",/review/rw7197696/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2022,gymoantwerpen,2," well, they had a good respectable run
","It's a shame the show changed this much. It's just no fun watching it anymore. Watched 41 seasons with the most excitement, but the last 2 were dire and season 43 seems to be even worse. Episode one i couldn't even sit through. I get the inclusion thing, although one of the reasons i always loved tis show was for it being so liberal and inclusive. It felt realistic and natural. I'm asian and never felt the need for more asians on the show as it just wouldn't be realistic. Hope the woke police will be satisfied at some point as every show is becoming super unrealistic. Seems the whole world is mostly gay now. As a gay dragqueen myself i'd say... Sure whatever.",/review/rw7197696/?ref_=tt_urv

","My husband and I are HUGE Survivor fans... that is, until last night, April 27, 2022. We will not finish watching this season and will never watch it again. First it started with Jeff can't say ""come on in guys"" anymore. Ridiculous!!",/review/rw7197696/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2021,brendaapls,2," Voting the change with my remote
",Done! Social Justice show or survival and game playing show? This isn't even about what is legitimate social concerns. The last few years the show producers have caved to the loud minority. We are out! So are most of the people we know. This show would bring us together for dinners and conversations and now it is ridiculous. Next Jeff will be apologizing for being white and make sure all the white participants are humbly apologetic as well. We are out. You have ruined it by caving. In since the beginning! Hard to believe that we can feel so done. Sad.,/review/rw7197696/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2001,Jdc102,," Just when you think it can't possibly get any better....
","IT DOES!!!!!!  This is awesome, and in my personal opinion I think the people on this version are a lot more likable, except for three (Jerri, Kimmie, and Debb).  The new version is filled with likable people, who you really want to get far in this game. Among my favorite survivors are Rodger, Elisabeth, Alicia, and really everybody else. Each episode is filled with adventure, even more than the original.  I remember watching the original and towards the beginning I thought it was a bit boring with all those people who I didn't know, but once I watched it, I was hooked.  With this one, from the VERY first episode, i was hooked.  This is a great television show, and I can't wait to find out what happens next!",/review/rw7197696/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wow myself and this show go way back when Richard Hatch won. I am one of few people that can honestly claim to be an "" Ultimate Fan "". Im such a fan that I even wrote about survivor in high school English for a paper / also a poem about survivor . The game has to do with your physical , mental , emotional and social abilities. Survivor is strategic - as there slogan goes you have to "" outwitt outplay and outlast "" . Life is like that to .",/review/rw7197696/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2022,pammy-41783,," True fans disgusted by the last 2 seasons.
",I'm disgusted that I've just watched 2 seasons where all of a sudden race is an issue. I've watched it from the beginning and now will never watch it again. It's a game. It doesn't matter your ethnicity. And Jeff just allowed it to be about racism. I hope it gets cancelled. All we wanted to do was watch a great show with people from every race that come and work together. And yes people get voted out. Get over it.,/review/rw7197696/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2022,nishen-49649,1," Season 41 is the worst season I've seen
","I live in the UK and watched all seasons of US, Australian and South African survivor. Australian survivor is the best and US is the worst. I'll give 10/10 to Austraialns, 9/10 to South Africans (last two seasions were excellent) and 1/10 to US (woke survivor). For them, it's not about entertainement anymore, just a box ticking experiment.",/review/rw7197696/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hmmm, I can officially identify with not one contestant. I wouldn't care but in todays age I am forced to accept everyone yet no one accepts a white male anymore? Survivor is on it last ditch effort to be relevant. Hard pass. And that's saying something as the first season had a gay male winner and we rode the wave of wholeness for some time but it is literally just too far for us. Required characters. Required characters. Jeff Probst sold his soul to liberal, facist America and his inclusion as the puppet master is actually quite comical as he is a straight, white male who runs the games. Now that's funny.",/review/rw7197696/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2007,JackSparrowBauer,10," One of TV's best shows
","Lots of people say that this show is getting really old. I have to disagree. I just love the concept of the show. Vote people out until there's only one person standing. I love it! I want to go on it, but I don't think it'll be around anymore by the time I turn 21. Still, it's a great show. Great competition, likable people (most of the time), and a 1 million dollar prize. This last season (Fiji) was really boring, but I know the show can still stay fresh. It's always really fun to watch, and I always get upset if I miss an episode.",/review/rw7197696/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2022,scottfurletti,1," The show gave in and went woke.
","If someone who has watched nearly all 42 seasons, the last few seasons have been getting difficult to watch. The last two seasons have clearly turned the corner towards wilkism and embraced it. And also seems as if the show is producers have set it up to ensure certain types of winners. This is a show, that's run its course for me and I won't be back.",/review/rw7197696/?ref_=tt_urv
