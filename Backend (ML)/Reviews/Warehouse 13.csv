26 June 2020,RobTortureWright,10," One of the most emotional films you'll ever see.
","I first saw this film not long after release when I was 16 and even then for the typical teenager I was who liked a completely different type of film I still cried at this and still found it fascinating. I rewatched this film tonight at 28 years of age and it reminded me why it stuck with me all those years. Almost a complete portrayal of life itself, At first you find yourself confused and a bit lost, but things start making sense and by the end you put the pieces together and see the beauty and wonder reveal itself. I'm still truly blown away by just how emotional the final scenes are and how someone's love for another person and the need to make things right can drive a person to commit an act of self sacrifice to better other people's lives, at the cost of his own. Honestly one if not The most emotional film I've seen, portrays loss, sacrifice and love so elegantly that it simply has to be watched to witness such a wonderful story.",/review/rw2001559/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is the first time I have ever posted. I saw this movie and it made me want to post. IT seems Seven Pounds is getting a lot of negative press and I felt like I need to do my part to let some people know that this movie is SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL! For me, this was a rare movie that stays with you. I found everything about this movie beautiful..the acting, the music, the directing and especially the beautiful story. A story of giving..sacrifice with purpose. I am not the biggest Will Smith fan, but I must say that his performance for me was ASTOUNDING. I felt his pain and was moved by what his character was doing. This is not a easy story to tell in 2hrs and I think they did a really fantastic job. This movie will not be for everyone...it moves slowly and may be confusing..until you figure it out...then the reality of his purpose will crush you emotionally and at the same time it is so beautiful....SWEET PAIN (it did for me anyway)....Seven Pounds is a wonderful movie that will stay with you long into the night and next day.....Thanks",/review/rw2001559/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2008,datdudesketch,10," Definitely worth seeing!!
","I don't give out 10 stars easily unless it's a film that can keep me guessing. A film that will make me want to see it through to the end, not because I paid hard earned cash, but because I truly care about the characters and where they're going to end up. If you like me, then you're going to want to see this one.",/review/rw2001559/?ref_=tt_urv

18 December 2008,rstone-27,9," Shakespeare of today.
","If this movie doesn't touch every sentimental nerve in your body and  reach to the core of your soul, you are not human.  This movie will touch your heart in places you never knew existed. Each  of us has seen those movies that reach deep within and cause the light  tear to seep out of corner of our eyes and we quickly wipe it away and  hope no one sees us. You will indeed be seen crying on this one. You  will need a box of tissues.  I do not know how or what the so called self critics are seeing, but I  don't think it's the same movie I just finished watching. Yes it's a  little slow, but its real. This is a human in tune with what he wants  and doesn't let ANYTHING stop him from completing what he started.  It's a Shakespeare tragedy in today's society. A movie you should  definitely see.  9 out of 10.",/review/rw2001559/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2009,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," Or as I like to call it ""Will Smith can cry like a..."" well you know what
","Seven Pounds, this was the movie where I was just convinced Will Smith is really going for the ""I'm going to make you cry"" films. One thing I can give him a ton of credit for, the man can cry. My only thing is, as moving as the story is, Will Smith has proved time and time again that he can act, so why is he taking this extremely depressing story? But nevertheless it's still a good movie. I do have to admit it made me cry, but I felt that the stand out performance was Rosario Dawson, I absolutely love this girl, ever since I saw her in 25th Hour with Ed Norton, I knew this girl was going to go far. She's beautiful, charming, funny and talented, can't wait to see how much further her career is going to go. But her and Will Smith, not so sure if they had the great chemistry that the film needed that would've made this into a great film.",/review/rw2001559/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2008,jasonandnick6,10," Simply, WOW !
","This movie is one of the best films i have ever watched by far. The direction of the film along with the acting was simply world class. It's an emotional roller-coaster. Yes it is slow, yes it gets a little boring, but whilst your watching the movie your always taking in the story line and my does the movie make up for it in the last 30 minutes when the jigsaw is put together and the full plot is revealed. I think this movie is actually better than The Pursuit Of Happiness which most will know was also a very good film. Will Smith, Rosario Dawson, Woody Harrelson, Michael Ealy and Barry Pepper all deserve awards with there 10 out of 10 performances. This movie for me is a must see, i am still actually getting over the film as it quite simply blew me away.",/review/rw2001559/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2008,GBarraxjr,10," Oscar material
","If this film doesn't get nominated for an Academy Award, there is no justice. It was an astonishingly good film. The storyline unfolds piece by piece and keeps you guessing until the end, trying to figure out who this character is and what he's up to. The juxtaposition of such a dynamically humanitarian man being an IRS auditor is the first thing that piques your interest and the mystery grows from there. In order to be an excellent film, you need a good story, good screenplay, and good acting. Seven pounds has all that and more. The story was upheld by outstanding performances by Will Smith, Rosario Dawson and Barry Pepper. It's more than a touching film. It's one of those rare films that actually makes you take stock of your life and reexamine your priorities. Kudo's to all involved.",/review/rw2001559/?ref_=tt_urv

11 December 2008,jaredmobarak,10," Hold the elevator  Seven Pounds
","It all starts with a suicide. Or is it a car crash? I guess it all depends on whether you choose to start at the beginning or the end. Director Gabriele Muccino gives you the ability to enter his new film Seven Pounds whichever way you prefer as he starts at the end and works his way back to the beginning, showing us the course of events that led us to that heartbreaking 911 call. This is one powerful movie; maybe that is because I'm a softy when it comes to dramas of this ilk, dripping with weighty moments and chock full of devastating performances, but either way, a film works best when it truly touches me, when it lingers in the back of my head hours after leaving the theatre. And this is from the team that brought us the overrated, sappy, and not all that redeeming Pursuit of Happiness, so I'll just say my anticipation was closely guarded for a big letdown. With all that, though, I was with Seven Pounds from the opening frame all the way until the credits rolled. Even though you figure out what Will Smith's character is doing, that secret mission he is trying to complete, it is the way in which he fulfills his penance that shines bright and leaves you with a tear-filled smile at the end.",/review/rw2001559/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2009,disdressed12,10," very moving and thought provoking
","this is easily one of the best films i have seen in a long while.Will Smith puts in a masterful multi-layered performance as the main character.the movie itself is also multi-layered.and requires you to think as events unfold.it's complex without being complicated.i feel it requires multiple viewings in order to catch things you may have previously missed.besides Will Smith,Rosario Dawson and Woody Harrelson are standouts in their performances as well.the rest of the supporting cast is also at the top of their game.this is not an upbeat movie,by any stretch,but i felt strangely uplifted by the time it was over.for me,Seven Pounds is a 10/10",/review/rw2001559/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2008,kishan-krish,10," Made me cry!!! Movie I can't forget!!!
","Seven Pounds follows the story of Ben Thomas, an IRS agent on a mission to redeem himself from a haunting secret. We follow him on his mission to seek out seven strangers in desperate need of help. Ben's plans are complicated when he meets and falls in love with Emily (Rosario Dawson), a young woman with a terminal heart condition. Italian director Gabriele Muccino brilliantly pieces together a tragic modern day Shakespearian love story, weaving between the present day and glimpses into the dark past. Seven Pounds is not a kick back and zone out film, you have to work as an audience member to put all the pieces together. The more you allow your mind to work in this film, the more you will get out of it.",/review/rw2001559/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2009,thinker1691,9," "" A Thousand good deeds. cannot atone for seven murders ""
","Watching the career of William Smith is not only impressive, but certain to increase in scope, temperament and professionalism. This young man is to say the very least incredible. His talent as well as his versatile performances speak of a true thespian. Here is a case in point. This movie is called "" Seven Pounds "" and relates the story of Tim Thomas (Will Smith), a young man driving a fancy sport's car at high velocity at night in the rain. It's bad enough he is speeding on the interstate, in the dark, talking to his fiancée who's examining a wedding ring, but his diverted attention is not on the road ahead. Directly before him on a collision course is a loaded van, filled with children. What transpires next is the stuff of tragic, horrible, unforgiving nightmares. The movie then follows the remorseful hero as he sets himself a nearly impossible task. Establishing his personal penance, Thomas selects seven people whom he deems worthy and needing help. The character is sincere about his lofty goal, but walks a tightrope between legal action and complex spiritual Karma. In doing so, the audience witnesses his personal struggle and his humble admission to make up for his mistake. Michael Ealy plays his brother Ben, while Woody Harrelson plays Ezra Turner. Rosario Dawson plays Emily Posa, the adhesion to the film and a remarkable assets to the story. A good film and easily recommended, despite the fact the movie strains the audience's patience with its snail's pace and tawdry length. ****",/review/rw2001559/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2010,gts-14,10," Clean the beast / Fix the beast
","The beast might be the desire to inflict suffering after enduring it, but smith's character's heart was somehow enlarged more than the grinch's. It's hard to imagine that a 1,000 pound, 100-yr-old printing press can leave its mark on seven sheets of paper with an imprint as gentle as a kiss, but his character accomplished that too: the help he gave to others was as subtle as it was extreme, with no expectation of reciprocity. Most moving was his decision to apply every last ounce of his financial, psychological, and physical resources to literally ""complete"" strangers: much like the box jellyfish, ultimate power over another person's life can be the most deadly creature on earth. But in his hands it was the most beautiful thing ever seen. Very ironic that I picked up this film on valentine's day! Much more so that I'd never heard of it before; it blew me away. It deserves a top rating for the story concept alone.",/review/rw2001559/?ref_=tt_urv

24 August 2009,bluepolkadotsxo,10," Worth seeing.
","Although I can understand the bad things someone has to say about this movie, I still found it to be absolutely amazing. It will touch you, and unless your a critic searching deep into the flaws and mishaps of every movie, or you just simply aren't touched by anything, it is worth seeing. Don't come into the movie expecting anything, just have a box of tissues and an open mind. It is beautiful and the acting is brilliant. I think Will Smith, despite that he's yet again playing another lonely depressed individual, is amazing. I believe a good actor is someone who can truly portray feelings and emotions we all have at our worst/best experiences in such a way that it reaches out to you and makes YOU feel something. And that's exactly what this movie does. Give it a chance.",/review/rw2001559/?ref_=tt_urv

","Ben Thomas is an IRS auditor but, just lately he has been pushing the limits of his job, using his judgement and perhaps tweaking things to help people. These people appear to be random and his motivations are not clear. At night he stays alone in a cheap motel room with no real possessions apart from a powerful, haunting memory from his past that comes to him in his quiet moments. He appears to be planning something bigger than his day-to-day actions but, as he works towards this, he finds himself befriended and falling for one of the people he has helped, Emily Posa, who is fighting for her life with a heart condition.",/review/rw2001559/?ref_=tt_urv
