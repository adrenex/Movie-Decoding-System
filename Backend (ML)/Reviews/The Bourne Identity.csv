14 April 2018,nogodnomasters,6," They can hear you.
","The Earth is apparently invaded by blind lanky aliens who kill anything that makes sound. How did they build a ship? Once you get past the inane plot, the film isn't half bad. A farm family with a hearing impaired girl communicates by sign and don't make a sound. The creatures have armor, but can be killed with gun fire so I am not sure how they still exist. Just drive around in a tank. They will come to you. There is a lot to this story that is not being told. We basically watch the family go through their daily routine trying not to make a sound and get killed. ",/review/rw4759456/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2018,ThomDerd,10," Don't chew loud.
","In a few words: smart, entertaining, novel and intense thriller movie. Beautiful cinematography and excellent acting from the kids and Emily Blunt. Nice one for John Krasinksi directing and writing.",/review/rw4759456/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2018,CharlesAncelle,6," A great concept with frustrating choices
","Anyone who lives in the world and follows movies has a pretty good idea of the main concept behind a quiet place: there are beings that will kill you if you make a noise.
The film does very little to try to explain where these beings come from, all we know is how long they've been there for and that they have change the face of the planet in a pretty radical way.",/review/rw4759456/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2021,paul_haakonsen,4," Well, at least they tried...
","Well, I finally got around to watch the 2018 movie ""A Quiet Place"" here in 2021, since a lot of people have been telling me that the movie was oh so good and that I had been missing out on a great movie experience. Yeah, so I caved in and opted to sit down to watch director John Krasinski's 2018 movie.",/review/rw4759456/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2021,teebear817,1," She gets pregnant????
","It's an interesting concept that's been done before in movies, so it's not unique... but it's interesting. If you make a noise you basically die... so they leave this kid roaming around in a store where he can be knocking everything over....then on the way home this child walking way behind everybody playing with a toy. Then after the kid gets killed the wife gets pregnant? Are you freaking kidding me? Pregnant with a screaming child to come in the future? That is insane. No way she would get pregnant. What Started out as slightly intriguing, quickly became irritating with no dialogue, just plenty of unnecessary mood music as usual. You never see any military or planes or people on radios. No way to know if there are other survivors or any hope for the future ....they deliberately keeping Bleak and claustrophobic. Basically you are watching a diologue free movie with subtitles for the sign language. Ludicrous beliefs that if you drop something on your floor, these creatures will come. With all the noise nature makes, wind, waterfalls, streams, birds, these creatures would go insane if the had such sensative hearing and they would never hear noises within a house. All in all....preposterous.",/review/rw4759456/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2022,movieliker1,6," Good, but plotholes.
","I generally don't like horror movies because usually they are just stupid. But as horror movies go, this one is pretty good. The acting (love Emily Blunt, not a big John Krasinski fan, but he's talented, and successful) the cinematography, and the music (not the songs they played, I'm talking about the cinematic score by Marco Beltrami) were all good. But as usual in horror movies, there were glaring plotholes.",/review/rw4759456/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2019,Wizard-8,4," Not boring, but too many unanswered questions
","As my subject heading states, I didn't find ""A Quiet Place"" to be dull. However, it has so many glaring unanswered questions that I was unable to enjoy what I was seeing. Here are just some of the unanswered questions I had (spoilers ahead): How did the aliens appear on Earth? What was their purpose of coming to Earth? (It couldn't have been just for running amok in the countryside? If the aliens rely on sound and not sight, how do they get around without bumping into things? Why aren't the aliens attracted to the sounds of crickets, rusty swings moving in the air, birds, or raging rivers and waterfalls? If the aliens can't detect noise from humans near raging rivers and waterfalls, why doesn't the family just live next to the rivers and waterfalls? If the aliens are indestructible (as seen on a blink-and-you'll-miss-it newspaper headline), why can they be killed by a shotgun? Why doesn't the family find shelter underground instead of out in the open?",/review/rw4759456/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2018,Platypuschow,8," A Quiet Place: As good as they say
","A Quiet Place was critically acclaimed and for some reason that tends to mean I won't like it. No idea why I just don't tend to follow the unwashed masses when it comes to movies, I am however mistaken sometimes.",/review/rw4759456/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2018,phd_travel,2," Just can't buy into the premise
",The preposterous premise about these blind aliens killing anything that makes a sound is so hard to swallow that it just doesn't grip the viewer. Of course once you start watching you want to see how the 2 likeable stars and their kids fare in this absurd situation. The childbirth is ludicrous. ,/review/rw4759456/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2018,claudio_carvalho,7," Tense and Original
","""A Quiet Place"" is a tense and original thriller with the story of a family of survivors after an undefined apocalypse. For viewers like me that do not see trailers or read anything about the movie that he or she wants to see before watching it, the beginning is highly intriguing and the mystery lasts until the moment their little son is attacked at the bridge. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski are married with children in the real life and this might explain their chemistry and behavior as mother and father. Unfortunately iMDb is no longer a trustworthy site to read about movies since the last modifications that accept manipulative one-line reviews made by robots or people with one review only that wants to diminish a film. My vote is seven.",/review/rw4759456/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2018,TheLittleSongbird,10," Unnerving silence
","'A Quiet Place' very quickly became one of my most anticipated films of the year. Have liked Emily Blunt a lot in other things, have a lot of appreciation for the genre and absolutely adored the concept. One of the year's best concepts and one of the most brilliant and unique for any film. ",/review/rw4759456/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2018,NpMoviez,8," Nicely done horror + thriller, quite recommendable but has many flaws .
","""A Quiet Place"" directed by John Krasinski is a genuine and tensed horror/thriller. It has a unique premise and backstory. The setup for the story has been done well. The performances by John Krasinski and Emily Blunt, along with the child actors is awesome. The direction of Krasinski is ""awesomer"". The tension and the thrills were genuinely great. That's something I have not seen in a horror/thriller for a long time. Speaking of horror, what we take as ""scary"" is totally subjective. If you're watching this to get some jumpscares or to see a ghost, this ain't your movie. There are many moments that give us the feeling of getting into the jaws of death, unexpectedly. Those were some real thrills. And, the characters know what's gonna kill them and why. So, whenever such things take place, the tension is amplified (no pun intended) and whether or not they are gonna succeed at the particular moment keeps you terrified. For me, anything that keeps you terrified is real horror than some ghosts and jumpscares, so I got my ""horror"" part in this movie, after a long time. It's not that it doesn't have any false scares, just one or two though. Whenever something goes wrong, you can feel the s**t happening. That's some incredible directing. It's just an awesome thrill ride until we reach the third act, where things just turn into the same old ""daddy loves you"" things and the final moments were a bit less satisfying for a thrill ride we witnessed for the majority of the movie. There are some notable plot holes regarding a ""better"" place they should've lived on, some sounds making no significance in the context of the movie's own rules, the way a lot of food, medicines don't get used up after such a long time, the crops being harvested (without any noise?) etc. The movie also shows certain stuff as if it was trying to say ""see this is a plot device, see see SEE!"" and it actually is so. One plotline with Emily Blunt and her ""youngest child"" was something that made no sense to be honest as per the movie's own rules and was obvious to play out in the later part of the movie. The way it was playing out was damn good, but we knew that something was up regarding this. That's all I can say and have to say about this movie, without spoiling anything. If you watch the movie, you'll know what I am pointing at. On the whole, I cannot overlook the flaws but man, I had a great time watching the movie. It's flawed but intriguing. It's probably the first Krasinski movie I liked so much. I have seen one or two other movies he made, some years ago. They were forgettable to say the least. This was, at least, unforgettable and nice.",/review/rw4759456/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2019,slivka_c,3," A series of unfortunate events
","I had to comment the whole time while watching this movie. Are you serious? Who leaves the youngest child so far behind in line? Who makes babies in an apocalyptic world where sound is your worst problem? Babies cry!! Then we fast forward a whole year, the day the father goes fishing with his son is when her contractions start, the basement stairs get screwed up, everything is falling apart in the same day. Luckily the new born is very special and makes pretty much no sounds. Just put him in a box, no food no problem. The creature rips through a silo like it's paper but has difficulties with a rusty pick up truck. I mean i can go on like this forever. It was funny and ridiculously predictable.",/review/rw4759456/?ref_=tt_urv

","The reviews range from couldn't get enough to wasted my time. I don't feel I wasted my time but it baffles me where the 8, 9 & 10s come from. Very good acting... a few good action scenes... but this is all sat on by a lack of any real comprehensive meaning.",/review/rw4759456/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2018,andrewjens-336-975762,4," I am speechless ... at how others can give this film 9 and 10 stars

9 April 2018,prehartwork,3," Had amazing potential, makes absolutely no sense
","First, I enjoyed some parts of this film. The suspense was on point. Acting was good. It wasn't totally unwatchable but for me, it fell short of what it could have been. I'm just going to list why I disappointed and confused. ",/review/rw4759456/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2018,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,1," Huge disappointment. Another overhyped film. Avg at best.
","This film was a huge disappointment. My expectations were high based on the Rotten Tomato User scores, I do not pay much attention to the industry professional critics scores so I ignore the regular Rotten Tomato Score and the Metacritic equivalent. I usually go by the audience score instead.",/review/rw4759456/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2021,rdhoran,2," 90 minutes of tripe
","This is a boring hour and a half of a family trying to be quiet. I didn't care about whether anyone survived because all they did was behave stupidly the entire show.

28 October 2019,Calicodreamin,6," Overrated
","I wanted to watch this because of all the hype, but I think this movie is a bit overrated. The first half is quite boring and a bit over dramatic (they're making nominal noise so why can't they whisper?). The second half is much better, once the action hyped up. But overall I didn't think the characters were well developed, the storyline was dull and lacked flow.",/review/rw4759456/?ref_=tt_urv
