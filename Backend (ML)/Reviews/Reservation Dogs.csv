5 July 2019,Clive_W,10," This is how you get ants!
","I love archer, such a good show, been watching it since 09 when it started, and hasn't gotten dull yet, there has been maybe the odd episode here and there that aren't my favourites but that's not saying I still didn't enjoy them. And in recent series archer has allowed itself to explore other story lines rather than him just being the worlds greatest spy, so long Brett, he was always useless but he died doing what he loved haha. Then when they became drug/gun smugglers, was just brilliant, I would say the detective season is not top my list but that gave us archer in a coma world, and the stories we've had from that have been amazing parodies, season 10 has one the best archer moments or more quotable moments. But that's not to say archer isn't full of quotable moments, this ones just new to add onto the growing list, but I won't spoil it for people. To anyone that hasn't watched archer should really check it out, and I hope we have many more archer adventures to come.",/review/rw6873143/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2016,planktonrules,9," 100% inappropriate....so don't let your kids catch you watching it!
","""Archer"" is a cartoon with no redeeming social values...none. It features dialog peppered with obscenities, there is quite a bit of sex and sexual situations, the 'heroes' have absolutely moral compass and there are drugs, drugs, drugs galore. So, it clearly is a great little cartoon to watch...just don't let your kids, your mother or your preacher know you enjoy this show. And, there is plenty to enjoy-- mostly because the characters are funny, strange and like nothing you've ever seen. As for the stories, initially they are about a strange agency which does spying...for money. In other words, they are like mercenaries of the spy world. And, when that doesn't work out well (mostly because all their agents are idiots and have questionable sanity), they resort to selling cocaine. All in all, one of the most morally reprehensible yet funny cartoons you can watch. Just don't say I didn't warn you!",/review/rw6873143/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2010,athomed,9," Archer is magically raunchy
","In only 22 minutes, Archer gets away with referencing dirty sex every scene, showing off the backside of a woman with the sting of a ping pong paddle still red, and being a very funny, witty new show! It gets away with them because it is funny and also happens to be animated. The animation really works with the style of the show.",/review/rw6873143/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2014,Mr-Fusion,10," As TV comedies go, this one fires on all cylinders
","ARCHER is a brilliant combination spy show and workplace sitcom, with all the quirky and messed-up characters therein. H. Jon Benjamin is perfect as Sterling Archer, but the whole cast is excellent (Amber Nash, Lucky Yates and the always-hilarious Dave Willis, in particular). You could go blind from the heightened dose of smartassery and the dialogue zings back and forth like flying bullets. It's actually kinda rare for an animated show  -ANY- show to be as consistently funny as this one. It's insanely quotable and packs obscene replay value. Seriously, it goes down like candy. And I love that they made Archer's spy car a '70 Dodge Challenger. Bonus points, right there. This show's a personal favorite.",/review/rw6873143/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2011,vod_kao,10," Ultimate Television Entertainment!
","This show is the best thing that's happened to modern day TV. It is animated, yet hits serious topics right at the spot. It makes it look like a kid's show, but definitely with adult situations, which is great. The characters are light and well situated. The dialog is outrageously funny and naughty, containing serious amounts of irony and masked profanities. The plot of the show revolves around a secret agency (ISIS) and the relations between the people working there. The main character is the confident, arrogant and self-involved, yet not that adequate secret agent Sterling archer - a handsome hedonist man, that never cares about anyone but himself. Hilarious. 10/10",/review/rw6873143/?ref_=tt_urv

28 April 2017,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,10," Imagine James Bond Having a Dumb Brother, and You Have Archer.
","Archer is James Bond in sitcom form. Unlike Bond, Archer's mother is the head of the secret service agency he works for. And this mother and son couple do not get along at all. They find joy in the other's humiliation and/or pain. This show is incredibly entertaining, and while the animation is impressive in detail it feels weird to watch at times because it doesn't have the same 'flow' as cel-animation. That's probably because it's done on Adobe After Effects and/or Flash.",/review/rw6873143/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2009,dkbengel,10," Wow! Just ... Wow!
","Having just seen the special sneak preview of 'ARCHER' on the FX network, I have to say that this was possibly the most entertaining, most ribald, most disturbing and just plain hysterical thirty minutes of television I have ever seen. Think 'Venture Brothers' meets James Bond meets a truck load of self-obsessed heroine addicts and you'll begin to get an idea of what awaits us all in January when this series comes to the masses in prime time. Fans of H. Jon Benjamin will love him as he brings his own dead pan cadence to Sterling Archer, a character that is arguably the most narcissistic is television history. The writing is quick and sharp, the animation is stylized and hip and the laughs come faster than you can catch them.",/review/rw6873143/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2018,sniffthemonkeys,9," Great Show overall, but loses its touch.
","Archer is an amazing TV show. It is truly hilarious but it loses its touch during the later seasons when they have new settings each season, it doesn't feel the same, which can be refreshing but also makes the show not feel the same. 9/10",/review/rw6873143/?ref_=tt_urv

1 October 2009,Willtur,10," Excellent show
",I was a fan of the hit and miss show Sealab and later on Frisky Dingo which was less hit and miss and quite entertaining. If you like rank shows. I am also a fan of Venture Bros and I don't see how you cant draw the similarities between the two. I am also happy to see Jon Benjamin get some steady voice work and he was great in Dr Katz and Home Movies. I would recommend it to anyone to watch the first episode before making your judgment. This is the best pilot I have seen in a while and usually their pretty lame even on shows I think have promise.,/review/rw6873143/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2010,greendaylink,10," Epic new comedy!
","Archer is quite possibly the funniest show on television, rapid fire jokes about whore island, a hungry hungry hippo, and baby crazy ex girlfriends, all that plus the brilliance of stir Friday. I am a total TV alchoholic and this show is incredibly funny. Though there is a slight issue with the comedy, if you take yourself too seriously and or you can't laugh at sheer stupidity the show might not be for you. Anyways you won't know if you like the comedy or not without watching and episode yourself. So I strongly incourage everyone to sit down watch an episode or two and I bet you will be rolling on the floor due to the doucheness that is Sterling Archer. Alright Andy I know the fact that arrested development got canceled still hurts but it doesn't mean you should start bashing a different kind of comedy. Archer is incredibly funny, and yes it is basic raunchy humor, but it is the sheer ridiculousness of each situation that allows the comedy to turn in literal loll. so open your mind laugh at a Russian roulette joke and enjoy the brilliant stupidity that is Archer.",/review/rw6873143/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2011,mudvaynelife24,10," great. very funny.
","if you don't like this show, then you have no sense of humor or you take your movies and TV shows far too seriously. this is a very funny and in your face comedy. lots of laughs, stupid jokes, just impossible situations. all of this creates an out of this world event. the premise if just a ridiculous secret agency that never gets the right things done. Archer is just a high school jock that never grew up. i showed this show to a few friends who'd never heard of it and we continued to rewind just to hear the jokes because they were just too funny. these jokes take it right to the edge without ever stepping over the line. its a must see for adults who still love their teenager side.",/review/rw6873143/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2010,jake-179,10," My new favorite show
","This is definitely my new favorite show. Absolutely genius, I would say this is the best show on TV right now. Of course, the content is right up my alley. I love Venture Bros. and other quirky Adult Swim shows, and of course various other animated shows with an adult target audience, such as Family Guy, South Park, Futurama, and the like. Of course, ARCHER is not on Adult Swim, but obviously it would fit right in. Fow now it is on TNT, which is great. I like the idea that a network other than FOX is getting into the this genre. Maybe we will see more shows like this pop up in the ratings battle.",/review/rw6873143/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2010,Marinerman1979,9," What an absolute treat.
","This show caught me off guard. I dismissed it without giving it a chance at first, but then went ahead and watched it on demand. I am sure glad that I did. Archer is an over the top raunchy fest based on the doings of a supposed spy firm. You have Sterling, an insecure guy who thinks very little, does very many, and says just enough to keep us laughing...mainly because he is so stupid. You have Malory, an unhappy boss who loves an enemy, hates being Sterling's mom at times, and has shown more than once to be off her rocker. You then have Lana(L-a-n-a), Sterling's Ex who isn't over Sterling. She is also a no nonsense, ass whipping babe. This show nails it. I highly recommend it.",/review/rw6873143/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2010,dalearyous,10," hilarious! i haven't met someone who hasn't agreed
",finally a funny entertaining show! lately it seems the other short 30 min comedy shows have become lazy and stale. and with south park not starting for another month i was very happy to find this show down right hilarious from start to finish. sure its simple. but the characters are so funny and its pretty well written.,/review/rw6873143/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2014,drummergareth,10," Classy, sexy, exciting and hilarious!
","Before watching archer I would watch cartoons like Family Guy, American Dad and Futurama. These sort of animated shows are good but old and don't change the formula of a successful show. They are all the same, a family/ group of friends getting into mischief everyday and each day is completely different but with the same people.",/review/rw6873143/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2021,ssvfolder-1,9," Amazing and much better then most
","I honesty don't understand how this show doesn't get as much buzz as some of the other adult cartoons out there. This amazing show is smart, cynical, funny, perfectly voiced and suitably animated (the only reason that I took off a star form a perfect rating, though with time you absolutely get used to the style of animation).
It has almost perfect character development throughout the series without too much drama. Captivating characters that in my opinion so much better than all other similar cartoons. Absolutely amazing re-watch value (I watched all the seasons up to date at least several times). This show did get a cult following and I'm really happy that it got renewed (hopefully for many more seasons), but it should be definitely have much more buzz.",/review/rw6873143/?ref_=tt_urv

17 March 2010,chrismueller83,10," Archer proves you can be completely disgusting and still be hilarious
","Archer is quite possibly my new favorite show. This comes from the creator of Frisky Dingo, the show that took a similar comedic aim at superheroes. Archer has some of the best character flaws on television. Sterling Archer is the womanizing main character who despite his aloofness and major flaws is one of ISIS best agents. Lana Kane plays his mocha ex lover who loves inter-racial porn and turtleneck skirts. Carol or cheryl or crystal, whatever her name is this week, is the sex crazed secretary who like to be choked in bed. Cyril is the comptroller who is somehow sleeping with Lana while trying to impress her more than Archer. Malory is Archer's mother/leader of ISIS. Her dog duchess spawned archer's codename and her torid love affairs with other spies all over the world get in the way of ISIS being the number 1 spy organization. And Pam is the chubby outspoken HR rep who is always looking for some way to appreciated while also insulting Carol for being Carol. The characters in the show mix so well together that each episode has the ability to be rewatched numerous times. Watch Archer on FX and see for yourself",/review/rw6873143/?ref_=tt_urv

11 October 2018,anders-n-aa-larsson,5," What the hell happened at season 8?
","I enjoyed this show a lot from season 1-7, and when in season 8 the comatose central character Sterling Archer in a dream becomes a hard-boiled private eye in the 1940's Los Angeles, I thought this is perhaps no worse than when, for example, Bobby Ewing died in ""Dallas"", and the story later, just turned out to be a bad dream his wife had.
