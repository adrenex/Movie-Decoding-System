","The last three movies I saw in theater were real dogs. I won't say what they were, but the last one rhymes with ""fake tricks."" I was in a movie slump, which made me a little apprehensive about ""Sing 2."" Turns out there was no need to be apprehensive at all, this movie was amazing.",/review/rw7699641/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2022,Gordon-11,," Delightful
","""Sing 2"" is truly delightful to watch! The characters are cute, the colour palette is vibrant, and the songs are good. It will bring a smile to everyone's faces!",/review/rw7699641/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,kevin_robbins,9," This is a very well done movie that is a perfect follow-up to the first movie with a well thought-out plot and good use of characters
",Sing 2 (2021) is a movie my wife and I recently watched in theatres. The storyline follows the gang from the first film performing together in the same theatre and not making it big time as they hoped. They decide to pack up and head to Vegas for an audition for a show on the strip. They win the audition but in doing so promised a star for the show who has long since retired. As the gang gets ready for their big act they will need to try and convince a star who has been out of the industry for 15 years to return to performing.,/review/rw7699641/?ref_=tt_urv

","First, I thought Sing (2016) was funny and entertaining. It had great voice acting, great characters, good songs, great musical numbers, and pretty animation.",/review/rw7699641/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2022,neil-476,8," Some great moments
","Buster Moon's proteges are playing sell-out shows in Buster's theatre, but he has bigger ambitions. He wants success for them in Redstone City, the centre of shiwbiz despite being refused an audition, he manages to blag his way into a big budget show for them, but paints himself into several corners in the process, not least of which is extreme danger from Mr Crystal, who commissioned the show. So, while production is under way, moves are afoot to find Clay Calloway, the star Buster has promised. The only thing is that no-one has seen Calloway for 15 years...",/review/rw7699641/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2022,silvermistvio,7," Wow! Didn't expect that.
","Unbelievably great. Although Sing film series has only one purpose that they perform a great show no matter how difficult situation they are in, I didn't think that it would turn out to be this great. That being said, I'd like to see some other different plots. Still, it's so much fun and in my opinion, it's better than the first one. I had a great time with this film.",/review/rw7699641/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2022,briancham1994,7," Better than the original
","I was pleasantly surprised to see that Sing 2 was better than the original. Although I didn't have an extremely high opinion of the first film, this sequel took the same elements and really blew me away. All the characters are true to their personalities and develop more as they confront challenges on a larger scale than ever before. Tired of being overlooked, the ever ambitious Buster Moon cheats his way into the dazzling Redford City and wins over Crystal and his daughter... for as long as he can! The rest of the cast find they're not what it takes, as Suki had warned them, but they force themselves to make the show work, no matter what. Throughout this film we get many new characters and some returning ones, which does mess up the flow of the film and makes the plot feel choppy at times, but it all comes together at the end.",/review/rw7699641/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2021,mrashtastic89,10," Perfect way to end the year.
","It's not often that a sequel is actually better than the original, but I can certainly say that that was the case here, Sing 2 came out of nowhere and was an incredible surprise.",/review/rw7699641/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2022,imseeg,7," Fun for the kids, because it is a happy go lucky animation. But fun for grown ups as well, because of the many great songs...
",Suited for young and old. Endearing musical movie about funny cartoon characters voiced over by famous actors and singers.,/review/rw7699641/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2022,singhlall,8," Great entertainment for the big kids
","This was amazing. Some great songs and performances. This will appeal to big kids and little kids too. Humour on a number of levels. Check it out. Bono has a great role and this is a thoughtful and well written ""kids "" film.",/review/rw7699641/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2021,masonfisk,8," NOT DEEP BUT GREAT FUN TO SING ALONG WITH...!
","The sequel to the 2016 original is more of the traditional 'Little Rascals/let's put on a show' as our intrepid promoter, voiced by Matthew McConaughey's Buster Moon, has hopes of taking his mildly successful local show to the big leagues; a Las Vegas like residency but after the scout is not overly impressed by their little show, Moon decides to gather the troops anyway to hopefully crash an audition. Getting his foot in the door, Moon bluffs his way to the show's backer, voiced by Bobby Cannavale, he can produce a reclusive singer, voiced by Bono, out of hiding to participate in their new production; a sci-fi travelogue created by Gunther, Nick Kroll but there is one caveat, Cannavale wants his daughter, singer Halsey, in the show so off the movie goes as the various cast members have their tasks to do interspersed w/warbling of recent hits keeping the well rendered visuals a delight & even though it's not to the story caliber of say Pixar films, they nonetheless still entertain a whole bunch.",/review/rw7699641/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2022,rafiado,8," Super Enjoying Movie With Family And Relax
","This movie is really enjoying, fun, and spectacular. The musical show was amazing and I really love it and I love all the soundtracks too, and i really like the stage and the stage theme it look so good. Idk why y'all hating on Meena I mean she's not that annoying in this sequel but Porsha oh god she's very annoying girl, like she thought she's the main character and can blame everyone, and I think that one cat is a gay cause he look so fruity with Porsha dad, I was kinda shock when miss crawly eyes was fall. The ending show was super boom super amazing, I really amaze when clay come to the stage and start play his guitar and sing, and the set on the ending was super cool, I was like WOW that was so amazing. The animation, Visual, Song, sound it was so good, the animation was really detail look like Pixar animation without Disney Style, and the animation was really detail to. I really enjoy the movie but the question is what Suki tell the police man to get that wolf (Porsha dad)",/review/rw7699641/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2022,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,9," Excellent animated musical.
","I found this sequel much more fun than the first film. It had me tapping and humming along. The story was well put together too. Excellent character development. This is certainly one of my top ten animated musicals. The animation quality was pretty good too. This is really a film the whole family can enjoy, both young and older will have grins and smiles on their faces by the time the end credits roll. A very good, feel-good film.",/review/rw7699641/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2021,MattD12027,8," Don't believe the critics
","This movie is wonderful, gorgeous, sad, sweet, and entertaining. You can't help but shed a few tears and bob your head with the beat. It's a feel-good experience without much substance but a ton of joy! Please go see it and feel again :)",/review/rw7699641/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2022,Anurag-Shetty,7," Matches its predecessor.

14 January 2022,On_The_Mark,9," Really great film, computer animation has come a long way
","This was better than the first one but also just the animation - man, it's amazing. When he comes out of the water, the wet fur, the stuff they're doing today is incredible, it looks so real. The whole city, the anamorphic animals, it's hard to believe it's animation. Just incredible work, beautiful colors and so much detail, there will be times you will want to pause to see everything. The work here is something to be appreciated.",/review/rw7699641/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2021,ayoreinf,8," Just like the 1st installment - the characters carry it through
","I had one more look at my review of the previous installment - I could almost copy paste it here - it's once again riddled with cliché - in fact I could say its basic premise is one of the biggest cliché in the book - follow your dream - is basically the heart of the so called ""American dream"" - if you really try hard you'll make it - just - never give up.",/review/rw7699641/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2022,JoBloTheMovieCritic,7," Sing 2
","7/10 - while I do not think Sing 2 does anything to reinvent any wheels nor may it be the most memorable release, I had a lot of fun watching this music-filled, visually-stunning, and all-around fun flick that ranks as my favorite animated film of the year.",/review/rw7699641/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2021,goshamorrell,10," Touches the Heart, Universal Studios has made another family hit.
","Buster Moon has a dream: to be the most successful koala in showbiz. In ""Sing,"" he managed to salvage the run-down venue where his musical theater ambitions might thrive, much to the delight of family audiences. Now, in that toon's jam-packed ""let's put on a show"" sequel, Buster Moon and his menagerie of pigs, primates and other crooning critters head to Redshore City - the Las Vegas-like entertainment capital of their parallel universe, which is basically human in every way except for the fact that there are no humans to be found in it - to launch a massive song-and-dance extravaganza. If ""Sing 2"" sounds like a shameless excuse for a bunch of celebrities to perform cover versions of Top 40 hits while animated animals lip-sync the lyrics for our amusement ... well, that's essentially what it is. Buster Moon (voiced by Matthew McConaughey) and friends set out to pitch an original show to oddly Trump-like hotelier Jimmy Crystal (Bobby Cannavale), a white wolf with an enormous arena to fill and nothing to draw in the crowds, joined by U2 megastar Bono as a rocker they must lure from retirement for the big night. Bono is an undeniably big get for Illumination, although one assumes that Universal just backed up the cash truck, getting a new U2 tune in the process. The ""Sing"" recipe is all about recycling familiar songs, but that track, ""Your Song Saved My Life"" - which is terrific - hints at how special this franchise could be if the team committed to writing original music instead. It's a more unified sequence than the series of solo performances that concluded Sing, emphasizing the camaraderie of a company that's not just a collection of performers anymore, but a community with its own set of values and aspirations. Sing 2 gave me goosebumps when Bono stated walking out playing his famous song, Your Song Saved My life... truggling with loss, Calloway just can't find any reason to sing again after the passing of his singular inspiration. By adapting the melodies of some of the grieving lion's own songs and internalizing their emotional arcs,. Sing 2 will hit theaters December 22, 2021. #sing2.",/review/rw7699641/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm not a big fan of musical theatre (most West End shows leave me with a headache). But the final production of ""Out of This World"" at the end is something I would be happy to pay any price to see if it was in our world. The songs are great, the choreography amazing, and the joy real. It would be worth the price of admission just for the final 20 minutes.",/review/rw7699641/?ref_=tt_urv
