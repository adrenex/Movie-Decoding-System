12 July 2005,griffin84,," Nothing could be sweeter...
","Growing up, my favorite book was, easily, ""Charlie & the Chocolate Factory"". Roald Dahl's magical tale of a young boy's adventure in the strange factory was spell-binding. Though I never had a problem with the original ""Willy Wonka"" move with Gene Wilder (despite how unfaithful it was, it was still a cute and heart-warming movie), I was doing back-flips when I heard Tim Burton, quite possibly my all-time favorite director, would helm a new version of the movie.",/review/rw1183022/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2005,thurberdrawing,8," Burton Studied the Book's Original Illustrations
","If Tim Burton's out there I just want to thank him for bringing the spirit of the book's original illustrations to the screen. He even matched the facial expressions to the drawings, especially in the case of Charlie's family. Charlie himself looks like one of the drawings, and the Bucket house is so much like the illustrations it caused me to realize that Burton is as visual as any movie director can be. (Recent editions feature the work of a different illustrator. I'm talking about the illustrations from the 1960s. The difference between the older illustrations and the newer ones is the older ones feature a lot of cross-hatching. I imagine the older illustrations are still available, especially in a hardcover, but you'll need to search the net.) I don't know how he did it, but he got the facial expressions of Charlie's family and of Mike Teavea's father down perfectly. He also absorbed Dahl's sense of humor. The opening fifteen minutes or so, in which the winners of the golden tickets are announced one by one, really get Roald Dahl's sense of the ridiculous. I think Burton's addition of Wonka's childhood story fits well, although I'll agree that the way this is resolved is not completely in Dahl's spirit. Even in the resolution, however, Burton maintains sly humor. It is well-acted by everybody. I'd like to say that Julia Winter, who plays Veruca Salt, has turned in a truly well-observed comedic performance. Depp converts the novel's jaunty, precise Wonka into a quirky one, but it works well, because, as in the novel, Wonka's endearing traits contrast with the fact that he's a tyrant. Roald Dahl gets a rap for his cynicism, and this movie softens his message a bit. Dahl is a bit like Orwell. Both of them point out that man, given power, will exploit his fellow human beings. CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY the movie is not quite as dark as the book. But it comes very, very close.",/review/rw1183022/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2015,PartialMovieViewer,10," Burton/Depp Brilliance
","I thought this movie was very enjoyable and well worth the admission. Unlike some, I did not read the stupid book and do not plan on doing so. Additionally, I do not identify myself as some Wonka devotee and I am sure glad that ginning up Wonka centric criticisms is not my sole reason to live. I must admit I am personally anguishing over the fact that, unlike others, I opted out of performing some pointless comparative analysis between - book – 1971 movie - and the most recent production. The end-result of wasting one's time regurgitating some of these condemnations will simply result in high-blood-pressure, chemical imbalances and soiled diapers. OK – now wait. Once this personal anguish subsides, I will be able to continue – ahhhh – it's over, I can now continue. This movie easily stands on its own merits. Similar to most Burton/Depp ventures, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", will definitely have a number of followers (which I am a member). To some, it will become a classic. Whenever these two dynamic personalities get together, they seem to always stir up some magical tasty potion of entertainment. I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Depp's portrayal of a bumbling, snippy Willie Wonka. His sarcastic and (apparent) clueless delivery was superb. I doubt anyone else could have pulled off this part so brilliantly. I was also pleased to see him evolve away from the very successful 'Jack Sparrow' persona and highlight his acting diversity as Wonka. And once again, Tim Burton highlighted his behind-camera brilliance. Very much like Robert Wise of-old, anything Mr. Burton turns out, is usually worth gambling on. If you are looking for fun and original entertainment – this is the movie for you. If you are looking for a remake, this is not it.",/review/rw1183022/?ref_=tt_urv

","I never cease to be amazed by the versatility of Johnny Depp. Whether he is a pirate or writing Peter Pan or an adventurer or a criminal, he never fails to entertain. There is nothing he hasn't done in his 45 films, or will not have done in the five films currently in production or the 15 films in pre-production. Even as the creepy Willy Wonka (Think Michael Jackson for comparison.), he was magnificent. Maybe we have to blame his father (Christopher Lee) for some of that creepiness. After all, depriving your child of Halloween candy is just mean.",/review/rw1183022/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2005,rspoelders,7," The Fabulous Return of Willy Wonka
","Yesterday I had the pleasure of watching ""Charlie & the Chocolate Factory"" at the Wilkinson American Movie Day. And, oh boy, I was in delight! Don't expect a bleak remake of the amusing (and rather psychedelic) 1971-version. It is in every way a genuine Tim Burton-movie, stacked with beautiful imagery, wacky humor and bizarre characters, but at the same time faithful enough to the spirit of the novel. Roald Dahl would've been proud. It also features outstanding performances by the entire cast. Johnny Depp gives us a strange, almost creepy Willy Wonka, Freddie Highmore is a perfect Charlie, the Grandparents are lovable and wacky, and the five other children and their parents are amusingly irritating. And last but not least, an excellent soundtrack by Mr. Danny Elfman, reminiscent of both Edward Scissorhands and his early Oingo Boingo-days. Go see this with your parents, children, grandparents, movie buff-friends, nephews and nieces ... they will be equally delighted!",/review/rw1183022/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2022,Calicodreamin,6," Bizarre, good, but not as good as original
","As far as remakes go, not bad, but doesn't surpass the original. Depp is perfectly weird, Highmore couldn't be more adorable, other actors well cast. The storyline is just enough of the same and some new. The songs are too weird and detract. Film relies too heavily on CGI making it cartoony.",/review/rw1183022/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2009,moonspinner55,3," Begins wonderfully...but the fun dissipates inside the factory, and Depp is a disappointment
","Tim Burton's version of Roald Dahl's classic children's book, previously filmed with music in 1971 as ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"", opens with great promise, featuring incredible art direction that mixes German Expressionism with Grimm-like fantasy (aided by Danny Elfman's atmospheric, if familiar, score). Charlie Bucket, a child of little privilege who lives with his family in a lopsided house, longs to be one of five lucky worldwide recipients of a prized Golden Ticket, an invitation to tour the candy factory of reclusive genius Willy Wonka. Burton mounts the excitement of the treasure hunt, with the tickets hidden in Wonka candy bars, with gleeful aplomb, and the satire--though a bit heavy-handed--is both trendy and amusing. Once the action moves to Wonka's foreboding factory however, and Johnny Depp takes center stage as Wonka (a would-be misplaced child of the sixties), interest wanes. All the kids and parents are well-cast, particularly Freddie Highmore as Charlie and David Kelly as his Grandpa Joe, but the computer-generated effects turn Wonka's landscape into an impenetrable den of ugly colors and outsized objects (like moving wallpaper). Burton, who expressed nothing but contempt for the previous version, does borrow pieces from that film, improving upon some areas (such as Veruca Salt's exit, with squirrels instead of geese) but falling far short on others (when Grandpa Joe and Charlie secretly unwrap a Wonka bar at night and come up empty, there's no camaraderie between the two, and no embracing of the familial theme). The musical Oompa-Loompas are a dreadful come-down from the predecessor, with songs sung in different musical styles and Burton staging each like a music video (these sequences, too, steal from the first film, yet the Oompa's message ultimately gets lost in the silliness). Depp performs with too much grotesque caricature; sure, his Wonka is out of step with the world, but his sarcasm is too modern, and is geared to get easy laughs from the audience. Screenwriter John August is more out of touch than Wonka; using nasty put-downs to separate Charlie from the other kids is a facile and lazy way of telegraphing us that these children are bad examples, and the flashbacks to Wonka's childhood (as well as a visual history of the Oompa-Loompas) does absolutely nothing but chew up time on the clock. We first see Wonka himself in a flashback based on a story from Grandpa Joe (didn't Charlie know that his grandfather once worked for Willy Wonka?), making Wonka's official entrance several minutes later a non-event. This story is difficult to film without getting gummy or preachy, but Burton was on the right track with his opening sequences. Too bad the second-half is so misbegotten (and not even ambitious, really) that all the mystery drains away like melted chocolate. *1/2 from ****",/review/rw1183022/?ref_=tt_urv

15 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,6," Rather disappointing effort from Tim Burton...
","I know that the 1971 musical was unfaithful to the book, but I did much prefer that version to this well-intentioned but somewhat disappointing effort from Tim Burton, the director of Batman and Edward Scissorhands, and this adaptation was in some way more unfaithful in spirit than the 1971 film. The film does have some lovely sets and inventive visuals, the boat scene is fun if not as much as in the Wilder version, a great job is done with the Veruca Salt/squirrel scene and I liked the performances of Helena Bonham Carter, David Kelly and Freddie Highmore. But I was disappointed with Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. He just lacked the charm and grace Gene Wilder brought to the character, and I don't think Roald Dahl intended a characterisation that was more Michael Jackson than Willy Wonka. Some of the cast overact, especially the girl who plays Veruca Salt, even for the character the spiteful spoilt brat act was way overdone. I liked the music score by Danny Elfman which is filled with whimsy and appealing oddballness(I much prefer his Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare Before Christmas scores however), but the Oompa Loompa songs were rather annoying with none of the noisy melodies memorable and were shot like a music video. Tim Burton evidently tried to make the story darker, and in some respects to the book, it didn't quite work. A good example was the case of the additional character of Dr Wonka, as much as I like Christopher Lee, and he did perform well, but his character was unnecessary, and the script with some over-explanatory narration lacked the sparkle of the 1971 film consequently. The grandparents did bring some comedy, and the movie does start off well. But the unfaithfulness of the last half, meant that the whole film felt rushed and lacking in charm and magic which the Wilder had aplenty. 6/10 Bethany Cox.",/review/rw1183022/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2007,flyingcandy,1," 2005: A Film Tragedy
","This movie was simply awful. I am waiting for someone, anyone, to point out that Johnny Depp was just terrible. The first twenty minutes, in a grandiose fashion, leads us to a giant man named Willy Wonka who can put the world on it's toes by putting gold tickets inside five candy bars. Then when you meet Wonka, he's nothing. Johnny Depp is as pale as a sheet; I'm not referring to his white makeup and fake white teeth, but his acting. He's doing an imitation of Jim Carrey doing an imitation of Michael Jackson. His Wonka not believable at all. The kids are just bad. Rich, and bad. You get the whole Hollywood push of ""rich kids are evil, while poor kids are perfect"", meanwhile, what about the children of Hollywood actors and producers and directors, are they exempt because their parents are artists instead of capitalists? I don't get it. I just don't get it. I really don't get this at all. This movie was so terrible. The songs were horrid. One Oompa Loompa playing them all of them was cheap and lame; and the songs made me hide my head in disgust. And there is a segment where Burton pays ""tribute"" to Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"", and it's all but blasphemous to people like me who literally worship classic films. In the original, Gene Wilder was believable. He really seemed like the character. He was the character. But Depp, as usual, was simply performing. Horrible. Horrible.

","Ahem, where do I start? When seeing this movie the first thing that struck me was the ""exciting"" music at the beginning which reminded me a bit of Harry Potter. The opening scene was absolutely riveting, showing the wrapping of bars of chocolate. I almost fell off my sit because I was so intrigued. The beginning of the film surpassed itself in making us realize by about 2 minutes of it that it was going to be absolutely dreadful. The real fun began when we met Willy Wonka. I won't say who he reminded me of.. anyone who's seen the film would know and I don't want to spoil the pleasant surprise for those of you who haven't yet had the honour. The oompaloompa dances were possibly the worst things I have ever seen. Who choreographed them?! I want to meet this insane idiot! It literally made me want to puke.

28 January 2022,aidanratesmovies,10," Unpopular opinion- this film beats the Gene Wilder version anyday
","A brilliant and imaginative reinvention of a classic tale- Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (like the title) stays a lot more true to Roald Dahl's original source material and makes for a wonderfully wild and entertaining time. Growing up as a youngin- I felt deeply connected to Roald Dahl's imaginative and vibrant stories; having written such books a James and the Giant Peach, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Witches, Matilda and so many more- but no book ever meant more to me than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. When I saw the original film, wide-eyed and excited after reading the book a handful of times already, I felt an immense amount of disappointment and boredom. The original film's acting is dreadful, lacking of a consistent tone, broad and incredibly thin pacing, and all together just a very structurally unsound film. Thus I turned my child eyes to the work of Tim Burton with this film and immediately fell in love. It's such a beautiful adaptation from the source material, giving us the same songs used in the book, and staying incredibly accurate to the storytelling- with a few additions of course for the films runtime. All the films additions though, I really did enjoy, and provided a lot more heart to not only the film but also the character of Willy Wonka in general. The performances are all rather good, not a huge fan of the child actor playing Mike Teavee, but everyone else was perfectly cast and fun to watch- especially Johnny Depp's oddball character performance as the iconic character. The look and tone of the film exudes more of a dark energy, but I feel adds a lot to the wonder and whimsicalness of the story at hand. In the end, it may be an unpopular opinion, but I loved this film and would prefer it any day to the original adaptation.",/review/rw1183022/?ref_=tt_urv
