7 September 2021,planktonrules,8," Interesting and well made...but like the case, frustrating.
","In the late 1960s and into the 70s, an unknown serial killer calling himself 'Zodiac' killed several people in the San Francisco area. How many exactly isn't certain, as the killed appears to have claimed credit for his crimes AND other crimes. In other words, he wanted credit for all sorts of murders...whether he committed them or not. What also makes him unusual is that the guy enjoyed taunting the police and newspapers....and he was also never caught. I mention this because it's all public record...and a search on Google will tell you the case was never solved. And, because of this, no matter how good the movie is (and it is very well made), it must end without the killer being caught.",/review/rw1658353/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2007,evanston_dad,9," Not Your Average Serial Killer Movie (And That's a Good Thing)
","""Zodiac"" may frustrate viewers who come to David Fincher's latest film expecting a traditional serial killer thriller. The film begins with a couple of hair-raising and rather brutal recreations of murders carried out by the mysterious killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These early scenes are shocking and, compared to the rest of the film, disorienting, because they offer the only time that we come close to seeing events from the killer's perspective. As the film progresses, the Zodiac killer himself fades into the background, and the movie turns into a meticulous and engrossing document of the investigation to track him down, an investigation that includes countless blind alleys and false clues and which to this day has not reached a conclusion. I would be more prone to label the somewhat rambling screenplay as sloppy storytelling if I did not feel that Fincher tells the story exactly as he wants to. The elusive narrative works, because the film is about an elusive villain.",/review/rw1658353/?ref_=tt_urv

","On July 4, 1969, a killer shoots a couple on lovers' lane in Vallejo, California. The boy survives. The San Francisco Chronicle receives a letter from the Zodiac killer to print his letters with symbols. Reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr) is on the case with the help of eager cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal). The brutal murders continue moving to San Francisco. San Francisco police detectives Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) are given the case. Other police include Jack Mulanax (Elias Koteas) in Vallejo and Detective Ken Narlow (Donal Logue) in Napa. Defense lawyer Melvin Belli (Brian Cox) appearing on TV gets a call from the supposed killer.",/review/rw1658353/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2010,Hitchcoc,8," The World Doesn't Work That Way!
","This is a movie about process. It's about what happens when a case goes cold and simple answers don't suffice. It's a risk taken when one does a fictional presentation of an historical event from fairly recent times. You can stick tot he facts or simply make things up. I enjoyed this film because the three principle characters were real and human. All were in over their heads to some extent. Jake Gyllenhaal character makes that sometimes unfortunate serendipitous discovery and becomes obsessed. The police have done what they can, but without passion and this is what Gyllenhaal's character brings to the game. Unfortunately, so much time has passed and so much has gone cold. So everything is based on circumstance. We must content ourselves with what we find and give up on confessions or witnesses. I knew from the start what the case was about and I recommend that those sourpusses that complain about this film do a little reading (maybe one paragraph on Wikipedia which should handle your attention spans) and then decide whether you want to bother with this. Personally, I thought the acting was superb and it painted a picture of the frustration with trying to solve a case with only bits and pieces.",/review/rw1658353/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2007,Smells_Like_Cheese,8," A great thriller about the true story of the brutal Zodiac Killer
","Just a few days ago, my mom and I watched a documentary on the famous Zodiac killer and his victims. It was incredibly interesting so it got me thinking about the film Zodiac that was released this year and lucky enough it was released on DVD today so I rented it. My friend and I just watched it a couple of hours ago and really liked it, especially on how it ended and was over all shot. I thought it was kinda cool how it started off like a documentary type of movie, but then was turning into a thriller that kept you going and guessing, even if you knew the whole story.",/review/rw1658353/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2007,classicalsteve,10," The Stranger Urban Americans Fear: A Killer Playing the Most Dangerous Game
","The era in which Zodiac takes place bridges two eras in urban America. The Zodiac appeared on the tail end of a crime-spree that rampaged across the US in the late 1960's. His settling in the SF Bay Area may be one of a number of social phenomenons that pushed America's view of itself out of an innocent 1950's sensibility and into a harder and darker view that became more prevalent starting in the 1970's and into the 1980's. People, even in urban areas, used to be far more trusting of one another, friendly, and civil. Many of the events of the 1960's gave urban Americans a much more cynical and cautious attitude toward people they didn't know. Don't trust or talk to strangers. Better to sacrifice helpfulness than to wind up dead. People are out to take advantage. At least in urban areas nowadays, it seems, people are much less willing to take the risk to meeting someone they don't know, largely out of fear.",/review/rw1658353/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2007,Wolf30x,8," Good, but not what you'd expect
","Usually when a film gets made about a media grabbing unsolved crime, the resulting movie tends to be overtly sensational and at best remotely connected to what really happened. Considering that director David Fincher's last film about a serial killer was the gripping but deeply disturbing Se7en, his take on the Zodiac killer almost seemed primed to be an extreme, nail-biting thriller.",/review/rw1658353/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2007,iamkilgoretrout,10," ""This is the Zodiac speaking...""
","I have been highly interested and engrossed in the Zodiac killer story for the last 5 years now and I can say, without doubt, that this is the best and most accurate telling of the story. The film presents numerous details that were unknown to me before seeing it. All of these facts and theories are thrown together in a way that strings the viewer along, you think it's someone, then you get new information and that person is no longer a suspect. Fincher really puts you into the life of a detective working on the case. You feel just as excited when new information comes about and are equally disappointed when it leads to another dead end.",/review/rw1658353/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2007,frankwhat,8," ""Zodiac""  A Favorable Sign
","I knew a good amount about this case going into the film as I always found the famous serial killer ones very interesting when I'd see a TV special about them on. It's also no secret that it's one of the few that went unsolvable to this day, so I really didn't know what to expect from a thriller that pretty much everyone already knows how it'll end. However ""Zodiac"" was made with a style that allowed the perspective to seem fresh, even if it ultimately wasn't. This is a must see for any true lover of real police work that gets down to the nitty-gritty of what detectives have to go through in actuality. No one's job is glamorized and in fact it's portrayed as the other way aroundpeople get fired, demoted, or simply go flat out crazy. What fascinated me so much about the 'Zodiac Killer' more than the other murderers I've heard about was how he kept changing his methods, which is the main reason why he was able to elude capture for so long. All in all this made for one excellent cinematic puzzle that remained that way.",/review/rw1658353/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2019,Calicodreamin,6," Good acting, good plot, too long
","I felt that Zodiac was way too long. The plot was there (as its based on the true story of the Zodiac killer). But I just felt that some of the scenes could have been cut back on or taken out entirely. It moves too slow for my taste, especially in the first half.",/review/rw1658353/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2011,TheLittleSongbird,9," One of David Fincher's better movies
","For me, it isn't his best, but it really is an impressive film. The best thing about Zodiac is its atmosphere, it is really quite chilling and affecting. Equally impressive is the story, it is a very intriguing one and told very cleverly as it probes the limits of knowledge and evidence with startling power. The script is very well written and really makes you think. And it isn't a David Fincher movie without great visuals and indeed Zodiac has that. The cinematography is really quite skillful and the scenery, locations and lighting match the brooding atmosphere wonderfully. Fincher also does a superb directing, in fact his direction is a primary factor in what makes Zodiac one of his better movies. This serial killer is also quite different, and this is in a good way. Fincher allows the brutality of the murders to take second place to how the investigation takes its toll on the protagonists, and I for one found that quite refreshing. The acting is equally good, Jake Gyllenhaal can be bland sometimes, but he has given some good performances too and his performance here is one of them. Mark Ruffalo is even better, and Robert Downey Jnr even more so. So overall, different but refreshing, clever and well made film and one of Fincher's better movies. 9/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw1658353/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2016,Leofwine_draca,9," Painstaking serial killer story might well be the director's best
","David Fincher's laborious, incredibly detailed account of the infamous 'Zodiac' killings that shocked America in the late '60s is another feather in the hat of the auteur and ranks as one of his best films. The problem – if you can call it that – with Zodiac – is that it's incredibly long and you feel every second of the running time. It's a slow paced movie with little action, more of a police procedural as the viewer becomes enveloped in clues and mysterious over an incredibly long period. Fincher's aim is to recount every single little detail of what happens, and as usual for this director, not a second is wasted. He really gets across the lengthy, sometimes lethargic nature of the case and the boring minutiae of police work. I was entranced by all this but some might find it off-putting.",/review/rw1658353/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2020,bluepink,6," Interesting story but 30 mins too long.

12 June 2007,ackstasis,9," ""I need to stand there, I need to look him in the eye and I need to know that it's him.""
","Between December 1968 and October 1969, a serial killer, who had dubbed himself the Zodiac, operated in Northern California, murdering a confirmed five people, though other potential victims have been proposed. Up until 1974, the killer continued to taunt police and the media with a series of gloating and threatening handwritten letters, in one of which he threatened to execute an entire bus-load of school children. The Zodiac seemingly derived his name from a brand of wristwatch, and his incentive to kill  suggested by a cryptogram he sent along with one letter  was taken from 'The Most Dangerous Game,' a famous short story from Richard Connell, in which a game hunter turns to hunting humans because they are the only quarry worthy of his skill. Despite the best efforts of the San Francisco Police Department, and others investigators such as author Robert Graysmith, the true identity of the elusive Zodiac remains, to this day, a mystery.",/review/rw1658353/?ref_=tt_urv

Providing a series of ciphers with clues to his identity, Zodiac taunts the police with more letters and murders.

23 November 2009,nixskits,10," David Fincher's best is challenging and not for everybody
","""Zodiac"" is a perfect match of visionary director and hard to condense material. James Vanderbilt did an admirable job of taking a larger than one life story and somehow adapted all these people and events (chronicled in Robert Graysmith's two thorough books on the subject) into a script that works. He should have received an Oscar nomination, along with Fincher, supporting actor Mark Ruffalo (portraying Inspector Dave Toschi) and of course, ""Zodiac"" itself for best picture. But the silly academy doesn't reward films like this often and I'll bet less than 20% of them even saw it! ",/review/rw1658353/?ref_=tt_urv

","Zodiac, David Fincher's film about the impact the San Francisco Bay Area serial killer's case had on three primary characters is delivered with great attention to detail and proper pacing. Zodiac is not a film that uses or relies on suspended disbelief to succeed and does not attempt to compress five years of story into one in order to keep viewers interested. Instead it relies heavily on the facts and uses all of its 158 minutes to present them in almost linear form and staccato fashion.",/review/rw1658353/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Zodiac"" deals with a series of unsolved murders which took place in the San Francisco area in the 1960s and early 1970s. (These killings were also the inspiration for the film ""Dirty Harry"", although in that film the murders committed by the fictional ""Scorpio"" were of course solved). It has never been established whether these murders were the work of one killer or several. It is generally believed that five murders and two attempted murders in 1968 and 1969 were all committed by the same person, who may or may not also have been responsible for several other crimes. A notable feature of the case was that the killer, or someone claiming to be the killer, wrote a series of taunting letters to the police and press, something which happens far less frequently in real life than it does in fiction.
