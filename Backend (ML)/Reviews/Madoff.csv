13 October 2004,mdm-11,9," 1980s Flashback to a charming romantic comedy
","Adam Sandler (a Wedding Singer) and Drew Barrymore (a waitress) first meet at someone else's wedding. They soon meet again, when Barrymore is making plans for her own wedding (to a total jerk), even though deep inside she feels that she's ""settling"" for security without true love. Meanwhile Sandler finds out about the two-timing bozo, when the groom-to-be brags about his adventures with every sexy girl that comes along. Secretly in love with Barrymore, Sandler eventually sweeps her off her feet.",/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2004,The_Void,7," Great entertainment with a lot of heart
","A little known fact about me is that I'm a big fan of fluffy romantic comedies. Why wouldn't you want to spend 90 minutes or so watching a film; laughing and ultimately feeling good at the end of it? I don't consider fluffy romance films to be at the absolute top of cinema, but they're good fun, and therefore get a thumbs up from me. The Wedding Singer, however, gets not one thumb up; but both thumbs, firmly, up. So, why does The Wedding Singer succeed more than most films in it's sub genre? Is it the jokes? The beautiful female lead? The gratuitous helping of 80's pop songs? No, it's that this movie has a lot of heart; that's what makes it a winner.",/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2008,planktonrules,8," I wanted to hate this movie but couldn't--it was a wonderful surprise
","In the last year or so, I think I've started to lose my mind. You see, up until then I avoided Adam Sandler movies--mostly because I so disliked him on ""Saturday Night Live"". However, in the last year or so, I have seen several of his older films that I actually liked. Now, this does NOT mean that I particularly liked all of his film! After all, BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE are hard to love--though I will admit that parts of them were pretty good. LITTLE NICKY, on the other hand, was just sludge! But CLICK, WATERBOY and now THE WEDDING SINGER are all movies that I grudgingly must admit were far better than I'd expected--especially THE WEDDING SINGER.",/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2000,Quinoa1984,7," Sweet
","The Wedding Singer is the first Adam Sandler flick that guys can take their girlfriends to see.  It is a nice (and funny) comedy about a guy (wedding singer Sandler) who has been dumped by his fiancee and is soon falls in love with (waitress) Drew Barrymore who is also engaged, but isn't in love either.  It is a nice comedy that almost comes close to a romantic comedy. Steve Buscemi, Jon Lovitz, and best of all, Billy Idol. A+",/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2004,SmileysWorld,7," To date,Sandler's best work.
","I've said it before,Adam Sandler does not do great films.He merely wants to entertain us.Though there are times when he has failed miserably,this is not the case with The Wedding Singer.While it does showcase Sandler's usual juvenile humor,this is by far his most likable character,even to date,and the chemistry between him and Drew Barrymore is undeniable. Though this film is not flawless by any means,it is funny and charming just the same.",/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv

",One of my all time favourite Adam Sandler movies -truthfully I don't watch anything he puts out anymore but this is a classic.,/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 1999,Coxer99,9," Sandler at His Finest
","Adam Sandler stars as a hopeless romantic in this warm and witty comedy that co-stars Barrymore as Sandler's love interest. This one is a big surprise for me. It's the funniest of Sandler's films because he seems calmer than in his previous and recent efforts. He's connecting to a character here it's a nice one. Barrymore is quite lovely as Julia. She's actually adorable in the role and the conclusion to the film is one of the most creative endings of recent romantic comedies. Directed by Coraci, who with Sandler, followed this up with the hit ""The Waterboy.""",/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2021,cricketbat,9," This is probably my favorite Adam Sandler movie
",The soundtrack alone makes The Wedding Singer worth watching. It's full of songs that take me back to the 80s. This comedy is a hilarious blast from the past that is grounded by an adorable love story between Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. It puts a smile on my face every time I watch it. This is probably my favorite Adam Sandler movie.,/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2005,lilcutie18613,10," Awww, the 80's :)
","Adam Sandler plays Robbie Hart, a wedding singer with only enough money to get by. He was going to get married, but Linda, his fiancé', doesn't show up, and finally confronts him saying that she was having second thoughts. Drew Barrymore plays Julia Sullivan, a shy girl engaged to the wrong man. They meet when Julia is waitressing at the place Robbie works at. They are instantly friends and get along quite well.",/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2002,sonata13,10," This movie floored me
","I'm usually pretty cynical about cheesy movies but this movie absolutely floored me.  Drew Barrymore was phenomenal playing role of Julia Sullivan. I've seen the movie at least 30 times by now and her expressions still make me cry, they're just so sincere. I don't know how else to put it.  As for Adam Sandler I think that this is his best role yet, he's a real person in this movie not just some overgrown immature goofball.  On top of everything it's a brilliant 80s satire, for me its right up there with American Psycho. I understand why someone would have reservations about watching this movie but my advice would be to put your cynicism aside for a couple of hours and just watch with an uncritical mind.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv
29 February 2008,barnabyrudge,8," Well-made, engaging romantic comedy.
","Adam Sandler had made generally second-rate comedy fillers prior to The Wedding Singer. Films like Billy Madison, Bulletproof and Happy Gilmore  very straightforward, run-of-the-mill comedy films. The Wedding Singer has a lot more to it than that, and is a surprisingly enjoyable and witty romantic comedy. The trick is very simple  it's a film about people. No fancy plot devices, no special effects, no action thrown in to spice things up  just real and funny characters caught up in a situation that anyone can identify with.",/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv

14 August 2019,jpw-55513,10," A very charming movie.
","Drew Barrymore is so sweet in this film. I just love her. The plot is very simple and a true love story. Of course, love wins out in the end",/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv

18 February 1999,Tito-8,9," MUCH better than I expected it to be
","The generally annoying Adam Sandler actually comes through as likable for once, and that is one of the keys to this movie being a surprisingly fun ride.  Sure, it's predictable, it's formulaic, and it's a little too heavy with 80's references, but I have to admit that I had a smile on my face for practically the whole thing.  Aside from Sandler, Billy Idol was fun to watch, Steve Buscemi's brief appearances were terrific, and Drew Barrymore was especially adorable and effective.  This was a great movie.  Go figure.",/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2020,The-Sarkologist,8," Absolutely Delightful
","It's been a while since I last watched this film, and it certainly doesn't fall into the typical Adam Sandler type of film, namely that a man-child is forced to grow up. In fact, it is sort of completely the opposite, though I'm not entirely sure whether his character in this film would strictly be considered a man-child. Yet, in another sense, I guess it is also one of those films when the main characters are trying to come to grips with who they are and what they really actually want in life.",/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 1998,Wild-2,," Very funny
","""The Wedding Singer"" is not Adam Sandlers best work, I thought he was best in ""Happy Gilmore."" Still, he'll still keep you laughing till the end of this movie. Drew Barrymore is also great as the innocent Julia. There are also very funny cameos by Billy Idol and Steve Busiemi.",/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv

4 August 2005,Moonlyn,10," Funny Singer!
","This quirky film has everything- lots and lots of comedy, a nice touch of romance, some violence and a hint of sadness now and again. Oh and it also stars 2 of the most charming actors- Drew Barrymore, as Julia and Adam Sandler, as Robbie. Their on-screen chemistry is very remarkable to watch and their individual charm is most appealing. The movie is set in the 80's and is a great nostalgic piece for that time period- in all is cheesiness and glory! Sandler as the Wedding Singer will surprise you with his musical talents. And musicians who have run the gamut of various music-related jobs will have extra giggles. And of course Barrymore will dazzle you with her cuteness and poise. This movie will leave you in stitches! And a must see!!!",/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2007,DKosty123,8," Sadler-Barrymore Works
","This film really centers on Adam Sadler's character. In saying that, this is a bit young a Sadler than now, but in this movie, Sadler proves early one that he can do comedy, drama, & pathos. Drew Barrymore, while not having anywhere near as much script, doesn't show all the range but is pleasant enough as the femme fatal in the end.",/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2017,Floated2,6," Entertaining at parts
","The Wedding Singer is considered one of Adam Sandler's better comedy films and especially of his earlier films of his career. The film is what is to be expected, with Sandler portraying his typical nice lovable guy that ends up winning over the love interest. There are some bits of amusement and entertainment but overall the film is quite predictable and is what is expected. The Wedding Singer is not quite like his earlier comedies, where the comedy is more juvenile, silly and over the top. Which is why many consider this of a more mature film. Overall, the Wedding Singer will bring back nostalgia for many and is another reason as to why it is as praised as it is, though it is quite sappy and not in a good way.",/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2020,r96sk,7," Adam Sandler is good
","Not as amusing as expected, but 'The Wedding Singer' is an enjoyable enough watch.",/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2006,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,9," Sweet, charming, hilarious, and heartwarming romantic comedy
","THE WEDDING SINGER, in my opinion, is a sweet, charming, hilarious, and heartwarming romantic comedy. If you ask me, the way that Robbie (Adam Sandler) and Julia (Drew Barrymore) met was very romantic. Also, in my opinion, what Linda (Angela Featherstone) did to Robbie on their wedding day was absolutely heartless. In addition, I didn't like Glenn (Matthew Glave) all that much. The music was great, too. Also, watch for a special appearance by Billy Idol near the end of the movie. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""If you like romantic comedies or movies where people meet by chance, I highly recommend THE WEDDING SINGER!"" Now, in conclusion, when you see this sweet, charming, hilarious, and heartwarming romantic comedy, prepare to laugh and be touched.",/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2014,beauzee,8," great script, acting, SNL faces, lift the all too predictable fluff-line
","sandler is the failed local rock star, now sustaining as local wedding singer. he is an '80s guy, Reagan era exponent > hey, what's wrong with getting married, buying a home, and makin' bucks?! problem is: his chosen one (angela Featherstone) is a dumb as a brick beauty (another Seinfeld actress, who played Jerry's sort of maid), who frivolously decides at the very last minute, not to show up for the kick-off of adam's new life.",/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2004,shawn9210,9," Not the typical Sandler movie
","The Wedding Singer and Punch Drunk Love standout from typical Sandler movies is two important ways.  1) The humor is subtler in these movies, and Sandler is much more subdued.  2) Critics actually like these two movies.",/review/rw0475810/?ref_=tt_urv
