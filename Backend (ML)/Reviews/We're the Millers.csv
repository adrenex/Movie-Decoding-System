28 November 2013,napierslogs,7," The fake family brings many laughs, the other elements bring a few groans
","""We're the Millers"" is a stoner comedy, except better than that because it's written as a family comedy - well, inappropriate family comedy. Oh, and it's actually funny. All of the main and supporting actors keep bringing the jokes so you can over-look the ridiculous plot. David (Jason Sudeikis) is still a pot dealer, even though he's 20 years past college.

","If you've seen enough movies you know exactly how this is going to end a few minutes in, so the fun is watching how they work the plot towards that conclusion. ",/review/rw7117908/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2013,naregian,8," Will probably be regarded as a ""so dumb but so funny"" comedy.
","There's nothing to it, if all you're looking for witty/clever/subtle/deep humor, and you hate sexual/stupid/slapsticky type humor...you will probably still like We're The Millers.",/review/rw7117908/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2014,sanjna-polamarasetty-869-692642,7," An actually funny comedy
","'We're the Millers' follows a drug dealer, a stripper, a runaway and a geek, who come together pretending to be a traditional, all American suburban family to smuggle a whole heap of drugs from Mexico into the US. Fortunately for us, Jennifer Aniston plays a stripper. With all the actors playing surprisingly likable characters, who's opposing chemistry works impeccably when put together.

10 August 2013,mattkratz,9," surprisingly funny
","I came into this movie expecting not-too-good things about it, and might I say I was surprised. It involves a drug smuggler who has to run a job across the Mexican border for a dealer. Knowing he'd look suspicious by himself, he puts together a makeshift ""family"" with three people he's familiar with:his stripper neighbor, a teenage girl runaway, and a horny teenage boy. They fly to Arizona and rent an RV. Hilarious complications ensue. Despite their characters and predicaments, they are shown to think fast on their feet with the bad guys sometimes, and the bad guys manage to track them down after they get the drugs, and some DEA agents find them and wind up accompanying them on their trip.",/review/rw7117908/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2013,ggibson63,10," Surprisingly Entertaining
","I was really excited to see this movie when I saw the trailer, because I thought it looked hilarious, and I'm a huge fan of Jason Sudeikis and I absolutely adore Jennifer Aniston, and I can guarantee that it does not disappoint. It was actually better than I was expecting it to be, because you don't usually expect much from drug dealing comedies. The plot in this was actually pretty clever, and to be honest Will Poulter's character Kenny really makes the entire movie. He played it so well, and he was perfectly awkward and strange, it was hilarious. It was definitely one of the best comedies I've seen in a while. Sure it did have some corny moments that are unrealistic, but I overall enjoyed the movie.",/review/rw7117908/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2014,MLDinTN,6," another road trip comedy
","The idea behind this movie is nothing really new. It's a road trip, this time to Mexico. A small time drug dealer, David, owes his supplier. In order to pay the debt, he must deliver a shipment of drugs from Mexico to the US. He ""hires"" a family to help him to seem less suspicious. They get the drugs then hi-jinx ensues. Of course, they are chased, there's some poll dancing, a huge spider, a lesson on kissing.",/review/rw7117908/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2013,Iv_Genchev,8," Finally!!! A solid comedy!!!
","I have to admit I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did. I laughed during the whole movie and truly didn't notice how did the time pass by. For me this is the best American comedy I've seen in the past couple of years. Very well directed, very good cast. The movie is very casual but at the same time so full of content. I can't come up with any flaws in it. It was not gooey like you would normally expect. Jennifer Aniston was just marvelous as always. I also liked Will Poulter very well.

30 July 2013,Bravesfan17,8," A Hilarious Comedy With a Great Ensemble
","It's amazing to think that nine years ago, director Rawson Marshall Thurber surprised everyone with making a hit film about the sport of dodgeball with the Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller vehicle Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. Since then, he hasn't done much worth writing home about until now with the hilarious comedy We're the Millers.",/review/rw7117908/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2020,rigz86,10," One of my favorite comedies of all-time
",This movie is hands down one of my favorite comedies of all time. There is no way you could watch this movie and not laugh constantly. This is a fun ride the entire ride. It is outrageous at times (but in a great way) but also has heart warming scenes and it all just mixes together in an incredible way. Everyone of the main characters plays their parts to perfection. It just hits all the spots that a great comedy should hit. If you have not seen this movie WATCH IT RIGHT NOW. You will not be disappointed!,/review/rw7117908/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2014,kosmasp,7," Entertaining and funny
","Though let me make clear that I only did watch the version that was shown in cinemas. So no extended version as of yet for me. But even in the cinemas, there were some very funny bits after the credits rolled (stay tuned for a ... tune, that will make you smile and maybe even cry, like one of the main characters here did).",/review/rw7117908/?ref_=tt_urv

","A very interesting movie. I really enjoyed watching movies that made me laugh most of his comedy attempts, especially from Jennifer Aniston and Emma Roberts. The drama side was very weak.",/review/rw7117908/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2013,girly_shu,9," You are going to laugh!!!!
","We're the Millers is going to make you laugh. The movie is more hilarious than you would think. You will be surprise how creative some of those ""stupid"", funny and ridiculous scenes are. The girls are doing a great job. Emma Roberts as an angry teen with a big mouth and Jennifer Aniston as a sexy stripper with mother instincts. Loved the stripper scenes with Jennifer who looks as hot as ever. Kenny (Will Poulter)is just so perfect for the part of virgin, sweet teenage guy and of course Jason Sudeikis as David - the drug dealer - is the one and only who can pull that character as good as he did. The Millers are just the perfect ""family"". They picked just the right people for this comedy. You can expect dirty, funny, sexy, ridiculous! Just go and see it so you can have a good summer laugh!",/review/rw7117908/?ref_=tt_urv

22 February 2014,brando647,7," A Good Deal Funnier than I Expected
","When the trailers for WE'RE THE MILLERS started making rounds, I had no intention of watching it. It just looked dumb. Another low-brow comedy catering to the lowest common denominator. Then the reviews starting creeping out and the general consensus seemed to be that it wasn't all that bad. It wasn't going to win any awards and it's doubtful to be on anyone's top ten list for 2013, but it was fun. So with that little bit of encouragement (and Jennifer Aniston as a stripper) I finally relented and, you know, I don't regret it. It's not a great movie, but it's definitely got some laughs thanks to a pretty nice bit of casting. It's a road trip movie with familial themes but it never slaps you upside the head with them. The movie is about small-time drug dealer David Clark (Sudeikis). He's robbed one night by a gang of thugs who make off with all of his drugs and cash, leaving him on boss man Brad Gurdlinger's (Ed Helms) bad side. But he's willing to forgive David and even give him a nice little payday if he'll run down to Mexico, grab a ""smidge"" of marijuana, and bring it back across the border for him. David reluctantly agrees and formulates a plan of bringing the drugs across the border while attracting minimal attention: pose as a family on vacation and cross the border in an RV. But he's going to need a family. He recruits his stripper neighbor Rose (Aniston), a homeless punk (Emma Roberts), and a sheltered neighbor kid (Will Poulter) and soon the ""Millers"" are on their way to Mexico.",/review/rw7117908/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2013,Dechappell,9," Well...
","Went to hate it, left loving it. Great funny ""real"" movie. Starts and ends like everyone movie, you know it from the beginning, but the laughs and the experiences this gang faces is well don. Not over the top , just laughs and a somewhat sentimental story. Not sure why all the bad reviews, went in with an opened mind and walked Out laughing and talking with friends about how much we enjoyed it. I encourage anyone in the edge to go catch this film. Good for Jen and good for Jason, more daughter and this would be great. Kenny almost stole the show... Man has no heart finds family and gains one. Worth watching Do it!",/review/rw7117908/?ref_=tt_urv

","As far as comedies go this is certainly one of the best I've watched over the last few months. It is an interesting combination of characters which work really well together. You've got the drug dealer, the geek, the stripper and the runaway (who in my opinion is more of a rebel than anything else).",/review/rw7117908/?ref_=tt_urv

13 July 2021,Nicolesbunny88,8," Just a fun, hilarious movie
","I was skeptical because I don't much care for Jennifer Aniston but I love Jason Sudeikis so figured I would give it a shot and was not disappointed. Aniston plays the vulgar downtrodden stripper so well and don't get me started on the genius that is Will Poulter. Slow build up to about 30 minutes in and then I just couldn't get enough! Its not a unique premise, however it does give the viewer a sense of what a real family is: whatever you make it. I will personally be adding this one to my rotation.",/review/rw7117908/?ref_=tt_urv
