24 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,9," Amazing!
","Narcos is just a flat out great show. Its just so gritty and realistic. It's about the rise and fall of one of the most notorious drug lords, Pablo Escobar. It also follows other drug cartels throughout the years and how they do business. It's about real life events which they execute almost perfectly. Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar especially is just incredible. He resembles Pablo Escobar as good as any actor has ever tried. Almost half the show is in Spanish but you get used the subtitles and forget about them pretty quickly. Once you start watching this you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible. It's that good!",/review/rw8461517/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2020,Supermanfan-13,9," Outstanding!
",Narcos is such a great show it's hard to explain just how good it really is. Wagner Moura and Pedro Pescal lead an amazing cast who suck you right into the show. There have been a lot of shows about drug cartels but this is without a doubt the best and it's bit close! It really is addicting once you start watching and you get used the subtitles pretty quick.,/review/rw8461517/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2015,michaelradny,10," Netflix To The Rescue
","Incidentally, I saw an ad for Narco on YouTube, and instead of skipping the ads like I normally do, I played this one out because I was genuinely excited for what I was watching. Instantly I jumped onto Netflix and I was not disappointed. This is a truly gripping show, one of the best I've seen this year. The characters and acting are done well and the storyline moves at a fast enough pace to get your adrenalin pumping for the whole episode. My only fear was that it would be too generic of a Crime drama, but those feelings were quickly swept away. This is truly an original and thoroughly planned out TV show with a whole lot of heart.

5 January 2023,gillmurphydogg,9," Great drug cartel series
","Such a great show! Though the topic of drugs and the war on drugs is so ""easy"", it can still be appropriated to screen so poorly. I found Narcos akin to The Wire in terms of doing honor to the subject matter in a multi-layered way.",/review/rw8461517/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2016,ahmetkozan,10," The Incredible Story of Pablo Escobar
","Narcos is an intriguing and entertaining series. Netflix again done a very good job. Season 1 tells the true story of notorious drug kingpin Pablo Escobar, who became a billionaire through the production and distribution of cocaine, while also focusing on Escobar's interactions with drug lords. This is a massive story.",/review/rw8461517/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2022,charlieedmond,9," Season 1 & 2 is crazy GOOD!
","Now, with the knowledge that most of the events shown are fictional and some real events altered for dramatic effect, I appreciate what the show set out to do.",/review/rw8461517/?ref_=tt_urv

29 August 2015,johmil-18374,8," Fantastic production, we are living in the golden age of series
",This is such a quality production. Its cinema quality in every aspect. I've seen two episodes so far but if this show keep this up I give it an even higher grade. Netflix is now really starting to compete with HBO and this is much better than Netflix anchor House of Cards for example. ,/review/rw8461517/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2022,mm-39,10," Best of the 3 installments
","The Original Narcos is the best of the three installment. The script/story is compelling, because real life is stranger than fiction. We all know stories are altered for time frames, and entertainment value. Incredibly, the more unbelievable events, like the terror raid on the justice court, and the huge bomb, building Pablos' own prison actually happened. I would think this got to be made up. Sounds like a t v script, but no it was real. The character arch, acting, sets, directing and the ebb and flow of the series was balanced perfectly. The mixing of the D E A (English parts) and Columbia (Spanish parts) are done well. Regrettably one may get tired or their eyes from reading sub titles. One of those binge watching series. 10 stars. One of the better shows, like Mindhunter, to watch on Netflix.",/review/rw8461517/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2020,Tweekums,9," A dramatized account of the rise and fall of the Colombian drug cartels
","This Netflix series charts the rise and fall of the Colombian drug lords as their power increases as they earn billions of US dollars supplying the United States with cocaine and the actions of the DEA as they try to bring them to justice. The first two seasons are centred on Pablo Escobar and his Medellin cartel and DEA Agents Steve Murphy and Javier PeÃ±a while the third sees PeÃ±a leading the hunt for the 'Gentlemen of Cali', the cartel which eventually took over from Escobar.",/review/rw8461517/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2022,oscarjneklund,8," All good cameron! ðŸŒ¿

28 August 2015,Tomadour,10," Addicted
","Having seen all Padilha movies, I was anxious to see this new Netflix series and had great expectations. He did it again. I cannot stop watching. One episode after another. OK if the cast is not Colombian. But they are all good actors and play the parts very well. I will try to finish this weekend all the episodes but i think there will be more seasons. Best series of the year so far. The action is great. The scenarios are perfect. The 1980's atmosphere is awesome. 10 out 0f 10. I hope they will make more series like that in the future. Good real stories and perfect action and direction. I could not expect less from Padilha.",/review/rw8461517/?ref_=tt_urv

","At one point in Episode 7 the new president of Colombia says to a group of US officials trying to have him accept more aid to hunt Escobar, ""660 tons of cocaine were consumed in the United States last year.

","Loved it from start to finish. I did not care that I spent most of the time reading English subtitles, this entire series left me wanting and wishing I could speak Spanish. It's simply superb! Not once was I bored, I did not want this to finish, I knew nothing about Pablo's life, but man, what a life he lived. You have to see this to believe it!",/review/rw8461517/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,xisage,8," Sprawling and Satisfying
","Fascinating, thrilling and powerful in all aspects. Top notch acting performance by Wagner Moura playing Pablo Escobar. Boyd Holbrook as Steve Murphy is very solid and grows in stature as it unfolds.

30 August 2015,katysuarez,10," Impressive
","As a native Colombian, born and raised in Medellin (in 1975) and victim myself of the Pablo Escobar era, I must say that I am pleasantly surprised with the show!!! I thought it was going to be another bad gringo movie about Colombia with lots of mistakes and not even Colombian landscapes in the background but, I WAS WRONG!!!! Very good actors too, I didn't like Escobar accent since it's not real Paisa accent but it's OK; it will go unnoticed to non- native Colombians ;)",/review/rw8461517/?ref_=tt_urv

","Kept me going all Xmas Eve. I love the acting, photography, historical perspective, political and cultural storyline. I was also please with the accuracy of the captions. I looked forward for each episode, couldn't put it down, don't want it to end. There are indeed many cartel, drugs dealers, cowboy violence, glamorizing, victimizing, blaming, shaming, complaining, and penalizing films. But this is unique. There is no gross killing, unjustified torture, unnecessary graphic sex and drug usage scenes, women abuse, humiliation, or discrimination. Notwithstanding, it made a good great masterpiece.",/review/rw8461517/?ref_=tt_urv
