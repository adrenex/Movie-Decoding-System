31 October 2016,Dr_Sagan,," This show is ....Special !
","Reporter Ozzie Graham (played effortlessly by Wyatt Cenac) travels to the rural town of Beacon, New York to write an article on a support group for victims of ...alien abduction. They do look like a bunch of weirdos but maybe there is some validity in their claims ...and then some!",/review/rw5664490/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2016,skintone-38600,10," A beautiful uplifting comedy
","I'm so glad I Found this show. It is uplifting,really,really funny, quirky,original,and poignant. The pace is just right,and is never boring, but moves along with wonderfully feel-good humor. I am so pleasantly surprised at this show. I really never expected a show about a support group for alien abductees to interest me.But the funny and heart warming characters have totally abducted me and now I'm hooked . When I try to put in words why I like the show so much it is difficult. But there is a magic about it that just works. The Swedish alien is great. It deftly explores our quirky nature and in the process gives us a different and refreshing perspective on what makes us human.",/review/rw5664490/?ref_=tt_urv

4 March 2021,ukgreek,10," Why on Earth and beyond was this show cancelled?
","This show was hilarious, warm, inventive, surprising, well-written with great actors, loveable characters, and an original storyline. It's one of my favorite shows ever and I was crushed that it was cancelled. It should've been given more of chance to catch on. I'm sure more people would've grown to love it. Sorry, Wyatt. You didn't deserve this cancellation -- it was a gem.",/review/rw5664490/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2016,cherold,8," Funny and likable
","This goofy show about a support group for alien abductees isn't the funniest of this year's sitcom crop (that would be The Good Place, or perhaps Speechless, IMO), but I like it better than some shows I consider funnier. It's quite funny, and the characters are very human and likable (even the aliens are very human - go figure).",/review/rw5664490/?ref_=tt_urv

8 December 2018,hannah07,10," Who's the idiot that decided to cancel this show ?
","This show was original and so freaking funny. The cast was perfect. The writing was original and hilarious. I looked forward to this show every week. Like I said above who's the idiot that decided to cancel this show. Heh, instead let's remake shows that have already been done. There was a reason they went off the air. Or do another so called Reality show that is so far from reality it stinks. This is why I hardly watch TV anymore. Here finally we get a fresh new idea that everyone can watch and they cancel it. I can't believe someone else didn't pick it up.",/review/rw5664490/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2018,A-Guna14,10," Please renew
",This was a good show. I think anybody would have enjoyed it and it should be renewed.,/review/rw5664490/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2016,thrall7,8," An original and very funny show
","I will confess to being a life-long sci-fi fan so when I saw the ads for the premier of this show, I was intrigued. It hasn't disappointed and is one of the most original new comedies of the year. Maybe the most original given retread sitcoms like the stuff CBS has rolled out with Kevin James and Matt LeBlanc.",/review/rw5664490/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2016,pereiradorogerio,," A very special and funny series!
","Man this was an absolute gem discovery! I love it. It's about a very special support group of alien abductees. Compare this with ""The Middle"" (which I stopped watching this season because it's NOT funny anymore) and you'll get it. This series is genuinely funny and yet it has some profound meanings hidden behind the humor. The cast is awesome, we get to see Wyatt Cenac at his best but the other actors, such as Ana Gasteyer, are really tailored for their characters and very funny. I wish comedy would go this way rather than the boring and totally not funny other specimens. What can I say more? Well, give it a try! The episodes only last 20 minutes and I'm sure many of you will love it.",/review/rw5664490/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2019,allen-57990,10," How did this get canceled? & How did this not get picked up?
","Let's see....funny as hell, all likable characters (including the aliens), low budget...ok good reason to cancel?? Boggles the mind!",/review/rw5664490/?ref_=tt_urv

27 March 2021,UrbanElysium,9," Brilliant!
","Ya know I'm fairly fed up finding brilliant shows I love that got canceled/1 (2 seasons if I'm lucky!) season!! This is great! I have zero complaints. Great acting, storylines, dialog, sets, music, directing- all excellent! It treats abduction 'victims' in a very humane way with comedy that flows naturally! WHY was this canceled!!!!!",/review/rw5664490/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2020,glasturla,10," Let's bring it back, please sign!
","This series is too good to die! TBS made a huge mistake cancelling it so please people, sign the petition and let's hope TBS, Netflix or someone smart enough picks it up again :) Jenkins has season 3 already written.",/review/rw5664490/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2017,jerrycrow44,10," Best comedy out there
","Excellent! Hands down the funniest show out there now. If I had to say something negative about People of Earth it would be that the episodes (about 20 minutes) and seasons (10 episodes) are too short. I cannot get enough of this show. I've binge watched seasons 1 and 2 a few times already and season 2 just ended. The cast is fantastic. Everyone has done a great job fleshing out their character. The writers, what can I say, I love you, and that's from the heart. Well, now that its out there I have to share the love with everyone associated with this show. Keep up the incredible work and Thank You! Everyone, Watch this show!",/review/rw5664490/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2019,Bobonthecouch,10," Delightful... the aliens grow on you.
","At first watch I wasn't sure this was for me. I like oddball, quirky shows but, I thought this one didn't quite hit the spot. I'm glad I kept watching. Ozzie's deadpan demeanor actually starts to pay off and the aliens foibles become all too familiar to us as humans. My wife made Ramen noodles for her lunch tomorrow and I just saw the final episode of season 1... made me chuckle. You'll know if you've seen it. The more I watch, the more I like.",/review/rw5664490/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2018,GovernorHorseman,10," The Show We Need and Deserve
","It's a show about alien abductees, pardon me, experiencers. It's a show about aliens. Yet the characters on this show are so eminently human that it almost aches, how easy it is to relate to them. Every single character is someone who is just doing their best to live with their own weirdness. It's a show about connection, and the fluid nature of faith, and learning to embrace the loser that exists in all of us. It's hilarious, and engaging, and ridiculously charming. It's not packed to the gills with rich 20-somethings who have been ""chosen"" to ""save the world"" - because good god do we really need another one of those on air? We really don't. People of Earth is about people, and how great they can be, even when they're not at their best.",/review/rw5664490/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2021,wescartee,9," TBS should get canceled!
",This is a great show. It should have never been canceled. Only show on TBS that ever had some mojo. I wish someone would pick this show up and get it rolling again.,/review/rw5664490/?ref_=tt_urv

21 November 2018,SnoopyStyle,7," light quirkiness
","Journalist Ozzie Graham (Wyatt Cenac) is haunted by memories of hitting a deer while driving to Beacon in upstate NY. He returns to the small town to do a story on Starcrossed, a support group of alien abductees led by Gina Morrison (Ana Gasteyer) or as they prefer to call themselves. Ozzie dismisses the group but his boss Jonathan Walsh keeps sending him back. The conflicting stories come together as the group realizes that the differing aliens are actually working together.",/review/rw5664490/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2017,ckimichels,9," So fun!
","What a wonderfully fun show. Entertaining, engaging, and fresh! It explores the alien experience with humor, playfulness, and just enough seriousness to add plausibility. The characters are delightfully quirky and endearing. The writing is creative and full of spontaneous little twists. My household is eagerly awaiting the 2018 season!",/review/rw5664490/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2021,jennifer-bond-566-366655,9," What he said.
","I agree, who was the idiot who decided to cancel this show. My exact thought were already voiced here. Reality shows are everywhere, this was actually something ORIGINAL. And GOOD. Really good. Resident Alien is finally giving me something close to this. Not the same. But close. Please uncancel this show!",/review/rw5664490/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2020,donsanuk,8," It should be forbidden to cancel series without ending
","People of earth is a nice, fun SF TV show
Both seasons are good
Sad that it was cancelled in the middle of the story
Seriously, it should be forbidden to do this
At least cancelled series could benefit from a unique last special episode with an ending",/review/rw5664490/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2020,djphakt,8," Amazing show that just didn't reach enough viewers.
","Just finished my second run through. This show would have been much more successful if it'd had reached UK viewers. Absolutely hilarious, totally out of the box comedy. Fresh and original. I'm gutted there won't ever be a season 3.",/review/rw5664490/?ref_=tt_urv
