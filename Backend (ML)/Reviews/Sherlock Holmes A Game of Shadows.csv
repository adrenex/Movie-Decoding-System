19 February 2020,christopher-underwood,8," Very rare and illuminating experience
","Such a good film. I felt shattered at the end, as if I had been through some terrible trauma, but exciting all the same, of course. First big surprise here is that this largely American film is directed by an English documentary filmmaker. Second is that the poster and title are just a wee bit misleading. Depicting a real incident in Kentucky we accompany four students on a mission to steal some rare books. Involving an excellent Evan Peters as leader of the group and also featuring the actual four from the original incident freshly released from jail. I have never seen anything like this as we slip from acted to real and back mixing and matching dialogue with the one character talking to himself at one point. Very involving throughout and very imaginatively shot, this leads to the most incredible heist. I'm not sure my heart has ever beat as fast and the mixture of fear, excitement, relief and horror was quite incredible. Most of this is down to the fact that the filmmaking technique used tends to draw you in personally and breaks down the so called fourth wall and as in a dream (or nightmare!) a large part of you is actually mentally engaged in the action. Inside as opposed to outside. Very rare and illuminating experience when the urge of four kids to do something different and make something of themselves tips over into something unstoppable.",/review/rw4327535/?ref_=tt_urv

28 May 2018,js-66130,8," THE BOOK THIEVES
","True story this, though the quartet of perpetrators of the most audacious literary crime have trouble keeping their story straight. That's part of the fun in recreating a 2004 Kentucky teenage heist: having the now grown ups involved, recount the events, separated by distance from each other, and time from the deed.",/review/rw4327535/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2019,ThomasDrufke,7," Downright Strange
","Now here is one of the most unique films of 2018, both in the story itself and the way Bart Layton tells said story. The fact that they used the real life people for each of the four main characters to help propel the story forward in a documentary-style fashion is absolutely brilliant, and even hilarious at times. Unlike their real-life counterparts, these four actors seem to have a really great future, each having their own share of scenes to steal. Unsurprisingly, Barry Keoghan was the clear standpoint, constantly bordering the line of unsettlingly charismatic and offputting. Which, for a movie like this, is basically perfect. A certain part of me watching this kept going, are these kids complete idiots? Some of the things they decide to do and how they go about doing them are just mind-bendingly stupid, but the way these characters act create a definite believability in some regard. But undoubtedly, American Animals is one of the strangest and most interesting films of 2018.",/review/rw4327535/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2018,jdesando,," Interesting take on a heist: truth or fiction? It's fun and sad.
","Welcome to the saddest movie of the year: American Animals. The facile title's suggestion of the metaphoric: that like Darwin's evolution, four young American men, coming from a comfortable middle class, make a ""survival"" choice to rob a library of treasured books like originals of Audubon's Birds of America and Darwin's Origin of the Species.

","A mesmerizing story about a couple friends that plan a heist in which is slightly based on real events. I crave the way American Animals is filmed it's so so good! Evan Peters and Barry are exceptional throughout they're meant for this it seems. The soundtrack is god teir, I see why it's got high ratings.

7 June 2018,briner8397,10," Wow!
","Bad title, that would lead most people to assume this movie is about violence and/or debauchery but there's very little of either. I might have been in the right mood but I was mesmerized and give it a 10 score. Based on a true story and yet a fictional retelling. You know basically what's going to happen but never exactly how events will transpire. Not one false emotion or action in this 2-hour film that treats moviegoers like adults (take THAT superheroes and CGI!). What a relief that a story doesn't take place on either coast, nor is it elitist. And although it's in the genre of heist capers this is a totally original setup. No banks, casinos, jewelry, or even cash. The perpetrators aren't sympathetic or unsympathetic, but believable. Also shows, for real, the impact on family and friends when bored young men cook up something exciting. Hitchcock would love American Animals!",/review/rw4327535/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2018,rorymarsh00,8," A fresh new vision of a weary genre
","'American Animals' is, formally, a difficult film to describe. It retains the structure of the heist films that came before it, even referencing them from time to time, cementing it as a disciple of those pioneers. Where the film stands out, however, is in the way it tells its story, in a non-linear fashion that seamlessly blends between the reality and fiction of this true-crime narrative. Whereas documentaries often use dramatisations to help visually realise their subject matter, here, these dramatisations take centre stage, supported by the painfully real inflections of those who were actually involved in this 2004 heist. This conflux, use to provide commentary, as well as irregular but welcome flair within the recreated narrative, help to differentiate 'American Animals' from other films of its pedigree. Furthermore, these aforementioned recreations feature standout performances from the likes of Evan Peters and Barry Keoghan, further distancing Layton's film from the somewhat shabby predecessors that deploy similar techniques. On a technical level, the film is fairly regular, lacking inspiration with its cinematography which arguably helps ground the events which it portrays. The score nicely compliments the action on-screen, effectively building upon the tension set up by the visuals. The film can, however, drag in places, particularly during the first act, whereupon it hits familiar story beats that could have been addressed quicker, the time taken with the set-up juxtaposing the otherwise revolutionary approach the film takes to the heist formula. Otherwise, the third act is nothing short of thrilling, with the conclusion proving a melancholic reminder of the reality of these events, and the impact they can carry, with its audacity to allow the audience to decipher the difference between what is true and false. 'American Animals' is a heist film through and through, but differentiates itself from others through the methods by which its tells its story and provides connections between the characters and audience. Whilst the pacing can prove problematic at times, persistence ultimately proves rewarding. Should Layton continue to adopt this unique approach to other genres, he may become a standout in years to come.",/review/rw4327535/?ref_=tt_urv

10 September 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8," Thoroughly exciting, bracingly original and surprisingly powerful; truly invigorating filmmaking.
","It's not often that a film makes you sit up in your seat and take notice, yet that's exactly what this heist picture does simply by being so brilliantly and bracingly original essentially for its entire duration. 'American Animals (2018)' intertwines real-life interview footage with its more traditional, though still refreshingly unique (especially in their fantastic editing), dramatisations to create an effortlessly cohesive and compelling narrative in which the documentary is inseparable from the cinematic. This culminates in a gripping, moving and viscerally vibrant account of a 'true story' that not only feels as close to being so as humanly possible but also like something that actually hasn't quite been done before. That's thoroughly exciting. The same can be said for the rest of feature, too, as it's a truly invigorating piece of filmmaking. It shines just as brightly from a narrative point of view as a technical one. There's an emotionally impactful cautionary tale steeped in regret running at the heart of the flick, with a wonderful and almost intangible tension constantly pulling between the interviewed men and their young recreations; the latter justify their actions out of a fear they'll regret not doing them and the former seem to regret having done so. This runs counter to the point you might expect it to make - inadvertently or otherwise, which is also the point most movies in its genre tend to lean towards. Some critics have mistaken it for falling into the trap of 'glamorisation', but I don't think this could be further from the truth as there's often a sense of foreboding, ominous suspense and even real horror which makes for a much more 'realistic' and impactful experience that focuses on the pain of actions that are often brushed aside and could therefore be mistaken as 'not that bad'. At times, it can be kind of harrowing and there's certainly a tinge of sadness to the whole affair. The regret is plain as day. In general, it's powerful stuff. I have a feeling that this movie has just changed its genre for the better. How many times do you get to say that and mean it? 8/10",/review/rw4327535/?ref_=tt_urv

26 May 2020,cricketbat,8," This documentary/dramatization needs to be seen to be believed
","American Animals offers a unique experience in storytelling. This film blends documentary-style interviews with a dramatized version of the actual events in a way I've never seen before, highlighting the unreliable nature of our memories. Plus, the story is one you need to see to believe, as this insane heist was carried out by college-aged amateurs. I'll be thinking about this film for a while.",/review/rw4327535/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2018,sheltonemma,7," What a hidden treasure
","Came to this without knowing the story, but having seen The Imposter, it's impressive seeing this director's confident next step. I loved the combination of documentary style with heist movie, characters overlapping and switching in and out of styles and scenes. Evan's energy is frenetic and he seems to really enjoy the role and the supporting cast are great. It's sure to be a cult hit, with a great soundtrack and some very tense and awkward moments that make you cower and cringe at the mistakes and situations these guys got themselves into. It does begger belief its a true story, that these guys pushed themselves over that line, thus changing their lives forever. However, the fact that it is entertaining does not belie the seriousness and sadness that also comes through more by the use of the documentary elements and interviews with the guys and their families, and the librarian. Although it doesn't ever really answer why they all did it, or why they really thought it would be worth it, why they could justify one element in particular, money aside, with any conviction, or maybe that's because it doesn't relate 100% to its audience, though we can still watch with mouths open and it has certainly stayed with me and will definitely recommend a viewing.",/review/rw4327535/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2018,florisklaver76,6," Beautifully told stupidity
","The movie itself is well done in my opinion. The mix between the acted part and the real people talking about their experiences is good, the acting is good. I just can't get over how stupid these boys are, most of them are doing well in school and seem to be bright enough. They are looking for something to make their lives more special instead of just living ordinary lives, going to college, marrying, having kids and so on. But the way they plan the heist is doomed to fail from the start, and it baffles me none of them actually saw that, are they stupid? Or just blinded by the desire to do something 'special'. Worth the watch because it is nicely done but man those boys are stupid.",/review/rw4327535/?ref_=tt_urv

","An awesome heist movie and not a single gunshot fired. Crazy ain't it?

4 April 2021,questl-18592,7," Library Heist
",This is an interesting movie to write a review for. I didn't love it but wow is it incredibly put together and I super appreciate the style and choices they made here. American Animals isn't a typically structured movie. Rather than being a standard procession of events portrayed by the actors it flits back and forth between the portrayals and the testimonial narrative of the actual people this is about. The way it plays with that idea of their retelling of the events and how their varied perspectives sometimes play with the portrayal we're given is a fascinating experience and one that I will likely go back to in the future.,/review/rw4327535/?ref_=tt_urv

9 March 2019,bob the moo,," Engaging from the start, and plays well as a drama/thriller
","Without knowing anything about the film beyond some structural elements I came into the film and was surprised by how quickly I was engaged by it. The mix of documentary footage and reenactment is not new or special, but it is effective in the early stages of this film of allowing the viewer to catch-up with the people quickly, while part of the reenactment builds tension well early on. As the film goes on, the documentary side steps into the background, but the reenactment side is more than up to the task. It links well to the real footage, adding weight, and the performances are convincing as young men in this situation.",/review/rw4327535/?ref_=tt_urv

8 September 2018,thechair,10," An absorbing study of crossing the line
","Wow. It's been a while since any film has gripped me in quite this fashion. At first I was uncertain about the mix of docu and drama but it proved no issue as I was swept along with this absorbing, fascinating and tense true-crime thriller. The slow build is expertly done, adding layer upon layer of tension as the gang move inexorably towards something it seems very few of them are actually thrilled to be a part of. We've all wondered what it would be like to buck the system, cross the line and taste life on the other side (or I have, anyway), and this film does such a great job of illustrating that drive and its inherent dangers. I simply do not understand the accusations of boredom and 1-2 star reviews on here. Each to their own, I guess, but from the soundtrack to the technique to the performances, every facet of this did it for me. Definitely one of the best this year, or any year. Superb.",/review/rw4327535/?ref_=tt_urv
