4 November 2022,AfricanBro,3," You don't need to
","It was meant to be funny but isn't. Story is something you'd expect in a movie from 2008, all it's missing would be either Sandra bullock, Vince Vaughn or Owen Wilson. Some of the characters aren't really believable, maybe each on their own sure but not all of them altogether. Not really down to the actors playing them, more like how they're written. It isn't a movie that's made for you to believe, it's more just to wring a laugh out of you with an obnoxious plot, but unfortunately it isn't funny which makes the movie seem a bit senseless. Everything was over the top, supposed to be one of those movies you enjoy with your brain shut off, you could tell in the plot which scenes were supposed to be the funny ones with characters put in crazy situations but the dialogue doesn't deliver. The jokes don't land, and it doesn't really have any characters you could root for even though it's a movie were you have to pick sides but I couldn't care less for any of the family. It could have been written so much better, highly forgettable and I wouldn't recommend going to see it especially at the cinema, mine even had an extra sub-charge for this, yet a movie like like Armageddon Time didn't, yet was premiering the same night with a bigger cast. Don't bother, if you're still hellbent on watching though, I then suggest just wait for it to come out for streaming because it's not worth paying for and due to the lack of advertisement or buzz you don't have to worry about missing out on an under the radar gem.",/review/rw8701789/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2023,EUyeshima,6," Immoral Characters Too Tentative to Sustain This Dark Comedy
","Dark comedies inhabited by morally reprehensible characters are a dicey proposition because they challenge the viewer to find something other than empathy to sit through a movie. Director/writer Dean Craig doesn't succeed even though he has a stellar cast willing to stoop to the depths of the venal motivations on display here. Toni Collette and Anna Faris play sisters struggling to keep their New Orleans cafe in business and climb out of debt. Their mother informs them her wealthy, nasty sister, Aunt Hilda, is dying with no direct heirs. There is a race to grab her fortune with two other cousins gunning for the same thing. A slithery David Duchovny and a hellbent Rosemarie DeWitt play the cousins, and in full Tallulah Bankhead mode, Kathleen Turner is Hilda. There are random amusing moments that work, mostly from Duchovny and Turner, but Craig weakens his acidic narrative by making Faris a shrieking harpy and giving the always watchable Collette moments of self-realization. I don't think this 2022 movie is nearly as bad as some have asserted. It just doesn't have the courage to maintain its dark tone to the bitter end.",/review/rw8701789/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,nogodnomasters,8," I love you more than my mother
","Macey (Toni Collette) and Savannah (Ann Faris with a potty mouth) own the Triangle restaurant which has been going down hill since the passing of their father. They are unable to get a bank loan and will soon be under water in New Orleans. In speaking to their mother (Patricia French) they discover their Aunt Hilda (Kathleen Turner) is in Stage 4 and will soon have no Body Heat. Savannah wants to go get in her good graces in hopes she remembers them in her will. Macey wants no part of it until she gets depressed hearing her boyfriend (Gichi Gamba) is going to Alaska for a year. Upon arrival they discover that their cousins are all there for the same reason. The conversation becomes laughably awkward and their actions they take lead to unwanted reactions This creates a funny adult comedy, not too crass.",/review/rw8701789/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2022,ops-52535,5," what is...
","Wrong with filmakers today? Howcome they cant make stuff better than this standardized generic cha-ta-nooga-choo-choo comedy, where the whirlpool of yap-yapping doing the morning excercise of verbalistic commotion, that , at least for a grumpy old man, wears and tears on the tuba auditiva, leaving me with an enforced tinnitus that can never be prevailed unless something funnier turns up...",/review/rw8701789/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2022,c-glive,7," Actually pretty funny
","I went into this with not much hope. Though some of the scenes are predictable, I give the script and actors credit for going all out in some of the outrageous parts. The movie isn't a record breaker but it was a damn funny change of pace. Everyone plays their part to perfection. Reminds me of Eulogy (2004) or Home For The Holidays (1995) or even Greedy (1994). Definitely should be in the high sixes on IMDb.",/review/rw8701789/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2022,tabuno,8," A Daring Darker Comedy, Not For Everybody
","Toni Collette, Anna Faris, David Duchovny, Ron Livingston, and Kathleen Turner star in this somewhat dark, risqu√© comedy about cousins attempting to suck up to a dying aunt and obtain her lavish estate. The director and actors have a lot on their plate in attempting to balance this daring comedy with the immoral actions and rather overt sexual interplay and even a rather M-rated scene late in the movie. There are plenty of reasons for the many audience members to be turned off by this movie, nevertheless with a finely, crafted delicate script and the adequately balanced diversity of the character roles, the humor, the sexual innuendos, the immoral decisions offer up a fascinating interplay of dilemmas that keep the audience off balance. The climax of the movie has a satisfying but nebulous ending for audience members to choose from. The key to watching this movie is to focus on Ron Livingston's and Toni Collette's characters as the moral backbone of the movie and avoid experiencing just a one-tone aspect of the movie which is in reality quite off-putting, repelling and borders on disgusting. Overall, The Estate is a difficult, different, and in some ways a refreshing and deeper, enlightening look at the material world of today.",/review/rw8701789/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,aluvstaemin,10," SO FUNNY PLEASE DONT LISTEN TO NEG REVIEWS!
","I don't what's wrong with peoples' humor nowadays but this movie was hilarious from beginning to end, usually all white cast movies don't make me laugh cause there's a half nude scene right in the beginning or it won't be that funny but this movie was not that. Toni and anna give you a laugh riot ; there's nothing unique abt the story it's the comedy of all the characters that make you laugh. Please guys if you wanna watch a simple funny movie nothing complicated just watch it. Todays worst to worst movies are loved by people cause they are either are too violent or too sexual or too complicated and a movie like this is just plain and simple.",/review/rw8701789/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2022,cwestfa1,5," Sent Out to Die
","Saw the film listed in my local theater listings and was shocked. It has a nice cast, Toni Collete, Ana Faris, David Duchovny and Kathleen Turner, but saw no marketing what so ever for it. It was sent out to die.",/review/rw8701789/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2022,ivantheeditor,10," Absolutely hilarious!!
","What is wrong with people these days?? No, but seriously... what do you expect in a movie?! If a movie like this which is good, hilarious, well-made, well-written, well-acted, etc gets such low reviews what does that say about today's audience? All the Marvel and Disney movies must have really messed with your head because you clearly have lost all sense of judgement. This movie is a total gem! The situations are ridiculous, the actors are hilarious, the writing is great... I mean what more could you ask for? I love Anna Farris and Toni Collette but the real MVP here was Rosemarie DeWitt. She absolutely stole the show.",/review/rw8701789/?ref_=tt_urv

16 December 2022,Tweetienator,4," At Best Mediocre
","Thanks to the cast, The Estate is not a total fail, but the writing storywise and especially the dialogues are not only a few times cringe worthy and plain bad, stupid, generic. Lots of the ""humorous"" scenes are also, lets be tender here, not too funny. What's left to say? The production is okay and The Estate got also a few good moments here and there. Anyway, like many, too many movies these days, the writer was not up to the task to provide something good, interesting and entertaining. Recommended only if you are heavy in some of the actors, everyone else search some other place to kill some spare time.",/review/rw8701789/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2022,cahidi,5," The Degenerates
","Dysfunctional relatives fighting over their dying aunt's inheritance. One of the lowest morality point in a human's life. You gotta be very selfish and shameless to do such a thing. Story wise, it's repulsive. But comedy wise, it's pretty funny. It's just that the cussing and swearing made the the whole thing sounds crass and crude. And it kinda putting me off. Anyway, back to the story, even though it's about a dysfunctional relatives and a loosed moral decision they're making, it still has a moral lesson to draw from. I just wish the director would've put more music into the movie. It would make the movie feel a lot less bland. Maybe even funnier. I don't recommend this movie for anyone. If you have something else, watch them instead.",/review/rw8701789/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2022,danieljfarthing,3," Dreadfully awful so-called comedy full of lame knob & poo gags (and some decent performances)
","In lame so-called comedy ""The Estate"" struggling sisters Toni Collette & Anna Faris believe dying aunt Kathleen Turner's inheritance will resolve their financial woes, so they move in with the grumpy old bag to butter her up for it... as do rival cousins Rosemarie DeWitt (with hubbie Ron Livingston) & David Duchovny. What ensues is a crass & unfunny parade of knob & poo gags that goes nowhere but the toilet. Writer / director Dean Craig did well on his debut with ""Love Wedding Repeat"" but totally craps the bed this time, wasting what's actually a terrific cast on fine form (including Turner - great to see her in a rare appearance)... just in a dreadfully awful movie.",/review/rw8701789/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,crozguy,7," Worth a Watch for Duchovny
","There's no doubt that this has been done before, but it's definitely worth a watch for David Duchovny, and his character. He is definitely the MVP in this movie! I got a few good laughs, mainly from Duchovny's character Dick. Kathleen Turner is the runner up with some of the other funny moments. Lots of crude humor. I enjoyed it for what it was. If you don't like sophomoric humor, like penises being exposed or suggestive dialogue, then this isn't a movie for you. Language was a little rough, not being a fan of the C word, and weirdly placed at times. Script seemed to be written on a junior level. Again, watch it for what it is. If for anything, for Duchovny's character!",/review/rw8701789/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2022,tsfisher-15950,1," The Estate A big disappointment
","I don't know who's choosing Anna Faris's Scripts, but they need to be looked at a little bit more closely. I was a big fan of her in Mom. But if she chose to quit mom for these movies, I would ask for a reboot of the show. I thought of with all of these stars in this movie, it would've been good. I'm a fan of David Duchovny. Also Kathleen Turner. I thought her previous movie overboard was a little funny, so I thought that I would give this movie a chance. I thought wrong. Don't waste your money. I was half tempted to walk out of the movie, but with the prices of movies nowadays, I thought I'd give it a chance. I thought wrong.",/review/rw8701789/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2022,frenkrp,3," The cast kept it from being a complete disaster
","Well, the tagline basically says it all. If not for the over qualified cast, this vehicle would have crashed within its first 20 minutes. I'm really wondering how it is even possible that this really bad movie gathered this ensemble. Oh well, perhaps it was all about money (pun intended).",/review/rw8701789/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2022,catkb,10," Funny from beginning to end
",I found this movie hysterically funny and exactly what I needed at the time when I needed a bit of uplifting from a really rough week at work. David Duchovny is utterly brilliant and Kathleen Turner is despicably wonderful and legendary. Entertaining right from the beginning with its twisted humor and frequent laugh out loud moments that almost made me cry due to un PC nature of the writing and acting! I will absolutely watch this movie again and have highly recommended to friends. Great comic acting and great timing. My parents also appreciated the humor and have shared with many of their friends...,/review/rw8701789/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2022,mmaxon-46379,2," Disappointing
","Great cast, but overall the movie was a disappointment. Usually you can find one of the characters is relatable, or at least likeable. Not so much in this movie. I just never found myself rooting for one character over another. The sisters, played by Toni Collette & Anna Faris were the most likeable, but I didn't really care if they inherited the estate or not. Kathleen Turner with her gravelly, deep voice was believable as the cranky, dying aunt. She added the fun to this very dysfunctional family. I so rarely go to an actual movie theater to see a movie and to be honest I would recommend skipping this one.",/review/rw8701789/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,meltoons,2," Some of the worst acting you will see from very good actors

26 November 2022,adriana2312,5," Flimsy thin story line
","A disappointment in spite all the great actors. All the time they had to make faces to emphasize a comical or hilarious situation but still it wasn't really funny. The topic could have made it into a great movie but it was flat and dead and predictable no matter with what they came up to get to the old ladies money. A high school play no more than that. At times they tried to ""shock"" the audience but even that was played out poorly. Why did the actors agreed to play with such poor script. Not really worthwhile watching. Looking at my watch and my phone now and than and actually being bored with the movie.",/review/rw8701789/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2022,mnpollio,3," With that cast, it is difficult to believe it is this bad
","There have been some pretty savage comedies written about estates, terrible relatives, and death, so it is fertile ground for someone with the right comedic chops. Writer/Director Dean Craig is not someone with those chops. From frame one to the last frame, The Estate is criminally unfunny, predictable and tiresome. The characters are largely unpleasant from the start and do not improve during the course of the film.",/review/rw8701789/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2023,pd78w,," Avoid this movie at all costs.
","A disgraceful movie for all parties involved. I suspect the film was made with a PPP loan - easy money during the pandemic. Perhaps, with few acting jobs otherwise available, several genuine and established actors were lured into this disaster. The script was at the level of a student film (with no offense to students).",/review/rw8701789/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2022,snotfinger,5," Don't blame the actors
","Great cast. They deliver. Story is same old same old, but script is funny and racy. Duchovny and Livingston look older than I'm used to. If it weren't for the swear words, wouldn't have been a great family comedy. Personally, I can't get enough of Kathleen Turner. She can be hilarious and deserves some big roles. Anna Farris is reliable as usual. Very funny. I think it's natural for her. Toni Collette is of course way over qualified for this role, but she doesn't let that bother her. I'm no expert, but I feel the make-up and lighting are very poor, which creates an atmosphere of a low budget movie.",/review/rw8701789/?ref_=tt_urv
