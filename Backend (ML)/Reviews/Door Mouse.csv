25 January 2015,patbradley435,8," Not as bad as they are all saying
","Okay, I've read Hilenbrand's book, which is simply riveting. Louis Zamperini's story is almost unbelievable and the movie cannot possibly do it justice in just over two hours. This could easily have stretched to four hours, but today's cinema-going public haven't got that kind of patience. The film is well done and I was certainly thoroughly entertained by it, knowing in advance it would never be as good as the book, but it certainly didn't leave me cold, demanding my ticket price back. Just watch this for the good movie that it is. Yes it could have been better, but it's a very good attempt by Jolie at the book. I just cannot understand why so many people have given it bad reviews. IMDb puzzles me greatly at times, especially when some awful movies get glowing reviews. Is there some sinister network of people out to sabotage certain movies? I really don't know. This is a very decent movie and Jolie should be proud of it.",/review/rw6053843/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2016,claudio_carvalho,7," A True Story of Courage
","During the World War II, the bombardier Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) and the pilot Phil (Domhnall Gleeson) are assigned in a rescue mission in an old plane immediately after a successful bombing mission. Soon two engines blow up and the plane crashes in the sea, and only Louie, Phil and Mac (Finn Wittrock) survive. Louie is a former Olympian from the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, and stubborn since he was a kid, and he encourages his mates. After a month on the sea surviving in two rafts, Mac dies. A couple of weeks later, they are captured by the Japanese marines and sent to a P.O.W. camp in Tokyo. The commander Watanabe (Takamasa Ishihara) is a sadistic and frustrated man and treats Louis with cruelty since he was Olympian. But Louis is hardheaded and brave and is not broken by Watanabe, resisting his torture and inspiring his mates in the camp. ",/review/rw6053843/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2015,planktonrules,7," Good, but the spiritual aspects of Zamperini's life seemed like they were de-emphasized.
","This film came out a few months ago, so by now there are quite a few reviews--so I'll try to make my comments brief. The film is a biography of the wartime experiences of Louie Zmaperini--as well as a few flashbacks to his life before the war. Zamperini was famous both for being an Olympic athlete as well as his being a prisoner of war in Japan--all of which he later wrote about in his biography. In it, he also talks about his difficulties coping with PTSD and anger towards his Japanese tormentors--as well as, with the help of God, he was able to let go of the anger and life a normal life. In many ways, this is extremely similar to another recent film, ""The Railway Man""--a film which, to me, is better and makes a much stronger emotional impact. ",/review/rw6053843/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2015,tavm,10," Angelina Jolie really did a fine job directing Unbroken
","Just watched this filmed version of the true story of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic runner who eventually ended up at a Japanese prison camp during World War II, with my mom. We both were pretty shocked by the atrocious events that happened to him during that war especially that one Jap officer really torturing him in many scenes. Angelina Jolie really made quite a compelling account about his survival instincts and also his expert running during both high school and the Olympics of 1936. We also had a female cousin of mine visiting and she had to leave when it really was threatening to get intense. Also loved the footage of the real-life Zamperini running during the Nagano games of 1998 with the titles mentioning how he ended up forgiving the country where his tormentors were. So on that note, we highly recommend Unbroken.",/review/rw6053843/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2014,jdesando,," Maybe his life is just not suspenseful. Not!
","Director Angelina Jolie has adapted Laura Hillenbrand's great biography, Unbroken, and made a conventional story about one of America's true heroes, Louis Zamperini. I'll continue to think about how Jolie could have made this more suspenseful, considering Louis was an Olympic runner, stayed in a life boat for the world record 47 days, and survived torture in two Japanese POW camps.",/review/rw6053843/?ref_=tt_urv

","As Jack O'Connoll was getting acclaim for his performance in Brit thriller '71 towards the end of last year his star was beginning to burn even brighter by getting the lead role in Angelina Jolie's upcoming UNBROKEN . Cue lots of interviews with Jackie boy along the lines of ""so what's it like working with Angelina ?"" along with hints the film was going to be a major contender at the Oscars . Of all the films from last year this was the obvious Oscar bait .

",I'm trying to process the rationale for the preponderance of negative reviews I'm reading for the film.

7 April 2015,gradyharp,8," 'A moment of pain, is worth a lifetime of glory.'
","Biopics touch people in a way few other stories do. In the case of UNBROKEN the film detailing the life of Louis Zamperini, from childhood in Torrance, California where he was a problem child until his brother Peter challenged him in more ways than one (and who has the most memorable lines in the script) to encourage Louis to run until he not only became part of the school track team but also an Olympic Gold Medalist and ingrained in his the indomitable spirit sense that reigns throughout this story. From the Olympics Louis joins the armed forces during World War II, sustained fighter plane crash only to be afloat at sea with his two companions for 47 challenging days then captured by the Japanese and placed in prisoner of war camps where he endures the cruel harsh punishment POWs traditionally undergo. The story is well known because of the history books and because of Laura Hillenbrand's novel. ",/review/rw6053843/?ref_=tt_urv

","I cannot understand the negative reviews of this movie ,are the themes of bravery,endurance and forgiveness outdated?It is well known that the regeime of Japanese prison camps was cruel to say the least.The acting of the lead players was faultless proving again that British and Irish actors can play the roles of Americans.I found the movie moving, inspirational. Yes it was violent but not gratious. Ms Jolie is to be congratulated on her directing. One question did the leads fast for their roles or was CGI used to give the impression of their skeletal frames.The ariel dog fights did use use computer enhancement as did the plane crash.I found this movie much more watchable than the much praised""American Sniper""",/review/rw6053843/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2015,dugan49,7," First half superb - last half not
","Unbroken opens with an extended sequence of a bombing run by a US B-17 crew against Japanese targets in the Pacific, and the subsequent attack on the bomber by a squad of Japanese Zero fighters. This aerial combat sequence is one of the most harrowing of it's kind I have ever seen. You actually feel like you are in that plane experiencing that terror and exhilaration first hand. This segment cannot be over praised, it is that good. Another sequence in a bomber, where the plane experiences massive engine failure and crashes into the sea with the crew all on board is also very well done. The flashback segments on Zamperini's running career are also fine, the extended sequence depicting three airmen's time on a life raft floating in the middle of the Pacific ocean is well done. So far it's all good. ",/review/rw6053843/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2015,phd_travel,10," Very well done - from air to sea to land
","This true WWII movie about runner Louis Zamperini feels like several movies in one because a lot is covered - from the air to the sea to the land. So things are kept interesting throughout the 2 hours. Angelina Jolie did a fine job - don't understand the negative criticism. She puts the viewer very much in the place of the protagonists and shows what you need to see with just enough detail. The screenplay by the Coen Brothers is surprisingly lucid. Firstly there is an exciting plane battle which puts the viewer right in the vulnerable position of the crew. The story of Louis's running is inspirational. Then there is the survival in the sea on life rafts for many days. Situations like this have been shown before but here it is particularly well done. Finally the conditions at the prisoner of war camps. There is a lot of brutality shown, more so than previous movies like the recent 'Railway Man'. Can feel for each beating. The production values and technical aspects are top quality.",/review/rw6053843/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2014,griffolyon12,10," Movie Review: ""Unbroken""
","I am always worried for actors when they try their hand at directing. For every Mel Gibson, Emilio Estevez, or Kevin Costner, there are countless others that try and just never seem to get a good handle on it. The biggest misconception that I think a lot of actors make is that since you're an actor you can direct actors better, and while that may be true, they're ignoring a lot of the other elements that make great directors. A director needs to not only be able to work well with actors, but they also need to have an ability to lead, to be able to see the bigger picture, and most importantly, to create the visual language of the movie. It's this last one that I feel a lot of actors trying their hand at directing struggle with the most. Fortunately for Angelina Jolie, she manages to prove that she is a very adept director with a strong visual style to go with her ability to work with actors. Her second film as a director, Unbroken, is as good of a film as any other director could make.",/review/rw6053843/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2015,bison_burger,2," Incredible story, horrible screen adaptation
","Louis Zamperini's story of survival was robbed of all feeling and emotion in this screen portrayal. Jolie has cast a very flat, laconic, and unconvincing crew of young Abercrombie models who lack the depth of seasoned actors who would have otherwise convinced us that there was actual pain and suffering throughout this. After a month afloat on a raft the three men's hair was well-groomed and one even had a goatee (are there razors in the survival kit?). I felt like I was watching Casper Van Dien in Starship Troopers; if you have seen this movie you will know exactly what I am taking about. Read the book - it will give you the emotion and satisfaction you are entitled to from this survival story.",/review/rw6053843/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2014,rebeccaspurlock,7," Jack O'Connell is outstanding..
","Lets just say I just saw a great movie about loyalty, courage, survival and redemption. Angelina Jolie has fantastic directing skills and its Oscar worthy. Jack O'Connell knocks his performance out of the park and he's proved himself with this great performance along with his performances in ""Starred Up"" and ""'71"". He embodies the characteristics of Louis Zamperini and the great wonderful life he lived. Jai Courtney had a small role, but really good surprisingly, can't wait to see him as Kyle Reese in next summer's Terminator reboot. The movie slowed at a point but picked it up and blew me away, O'Connell gives an Oscar worthy performance, but given the competition it's unlikely. Who cares though? This is one of 2014's best films and you'll see it at the Oscars I promise you that.",/review/rw6053843/?ref_=tt_urv
