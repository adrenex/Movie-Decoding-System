20 October 2005,JackCerf,6," A Useful Approach
","The central characters in this movie are unpolitical teenagers who have no concern with the larger political issues of Naziism and simply want to enjoy themselves. Their only perspective is that Nazis are stuffy, conformist jerks and no fun at all. For this reason, a number of mainstream critics (among them Ebert and Berardinelli) trashed the picture for trivializing the crimes and horrors of the Third Reich. These critics, I think, miss the point.",/review/rw0330126/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2004,BruceUllm,," Connected with me on two levels: Swing and Judiasm
","I have always been a very big fan of swing music and am a ""Hollywood Jew"". I.e., not very religious or observant of the ancient traditions, but still a Jew in humor and emotions. So this movie never fails to make my tear up. To imagine a time and place where not only your seeming friends turn on you, but you can't even listen to your kind of music is a special kind of hell on earth. ",/review/rw0330126/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2005,shneur,10," This film deserves A LOT more attention
","This was a real eye-opener! Even to old fogies like me, ""Swing"" is associated with being the music of our PARENTS. In ""Swing Kids"" we see it being very much the Rock'n'Roll of the 30's, with all the attendant counter-culture and generational rebellion elements that implies. When you add to that the setting of the film in the ascendant days of Nazism in Germany, the contrast is both amplified and rendered a much more serous business than just adolescent highjinks. I suppose when you strip away everything else, this is a ""loss of innocence"" movie, but that doesn't do justice to its meticulous production values, uniformly excellent acting, or tight scripting and direction. If the theme is old, the angle is new and very apropos: I was enrapt from beginning to end. (Look for Noah Wyle just before he became a medical student on ER!)",/review/rw0330126/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2006,silvergirl606,6," Good moments, could have been better
","I really don't understand a lot of these reviewers. The movie far from trivializes anything about the Nazis, it simply tries to portray a moment before the bloodiest war in history on a smallish scale.",/review/rw0330126/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2000,Burgundy,," Excellent insight on the youth in Germany...
","This movie does a great job of showing a different angle on the WW2 time period. The struggles the youth of Germany went through during that time were portrayed very well. People complain that this movie doesn't show the horror of the holocaust and the awful persecution the Jews faced, but that is not what it's trying to do! We all read or hear about what the Nazis did to the Jews (& other minorities) and think that the Germans must have been horrible people to have even gone along with this. But this shows how the propaganda they were constantly fed--as well as the activities & sense of belonging the HJ (Hitler Jungen) experienced--could slowly twist their minds to the Nazi way of thinking. One of the excellent things about this movie is how it shows how the main characters change. The changes in Peter & Thomas come very slow and natural, and only when you get to the end (and maybe re-watch it) do you realize how drastically they have changed their views. (Thomas especially)",/review/rw0330126/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2006,Smells_Like_Cheese,8," Why only a 6.1? This was a pretty good movie.
","I remember watching some of this movie in high school(way back when, 2001 I think) when we were learning about World War II. Many of us students kept asking the teacher what it was like to live in Germany at the time and wondered if everyone in Germany was a Nazi? So, they started this movie, but I had something else that day to do, so I only saw a part of this movie. I'm glad though that my mom picked it up recently because this movie had been stuck in my head for so long.",/review/rw0330126/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2001,Boodikka,10," Following: The Greatest Evil
","In reading the reviews, there appears to be some disbelief that the Nazis saw the ""Swing"" movement as any real threat. In Peter Profield's excellent 1991 Himmler biography, he makes it quite clear that the official party line was that ""Swing"" was a subversive evil, as much as any White Rose activity. As for inconsistencies in Bale's character, understand that he is merely a ""joiner"". When the Swing Kids seem like the trend, he's into them. When the Jugeund seem like the better trend, that's what he wants to do.....typically adolescent.",/review/rw0330126/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 1999,Adaleide,," Some people have obviously missed the point of this movie
","Ok for you people who refer to all the Germans as ""worthless human beings"" and talk about how this movie didn't focus on the holocaust, etc....WAKE UP! The point of this movie was to give another perspective on the war. Not all Germans were souless killers. Throughout the movie you could see the consciences of the main characters being pushed and pulled about what was happening. Over here in Western culture, everything is portrayed in black and white:  all the Germans were completely evil, and we were the good ones. No one is denying that the Germans committed some horrific atrocities, but there were some who resisted doing those crimes, and others who actually believed that they were morally in the right because of centuries of ingrained anti-semitism. Geez, North America was anti-semitic then too! Swing Kids looks at Germany from the inside, and the different forces that were at work. Everyone knows what happened during the Holocaust....this movie wasn't about that. I think people should look at all different viewpoints before classifying all the people in a certain group (ie all of the German nation) into one cubbyhole of evil.",/review/rw0330126/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 1999,Tin Man-5,," Uneven, but powerful
","Four German teenage boys (Leonard, Bale, Whaley, and Batrok), living under Nazy reign in World War II, secretly play Swing music, American stuff that's been forbidden, and embrace the concepts of the musical heritage. But this is clearly an act of rebellion, so they must do it in secret clubs at night, avoiding the Gestapo. Their relationships and the outcomes are the study of this film, which is both uneven and, ultimately, very powerful.",/review/rw0330126/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2008,bkoganbing,8," Strangulation Of Culture
","I do love swing music and love the music and artists from the era. So did my parents who were contemporary with it. But they had the good fortune to love it in the USA. It was a dangerous thing to like Benny Goodman, Count Basie, Duke Ellington and most of all Arthur Shawronsky who the authorities did know was Artie Shaw. But these squares were the Gestapo and Swing Kids is about the youth who loved American swing music at considerable cost.",/review/rw0330126/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2004,pipgirl,," entertaining and poignant, a great film
","I'm a History teacher and we use Swing Kids as an introduction to the topic of alternative youth groups in Nazi Germany. I'm not saying that the film is 100% accurate, obviously some dramatic licence has to be taken, but its not far off. Many people on this site have questioned the accuracy, and validity of the film, especially mentioning the lack of consideration of the treatment of the Jews. However that is not what this film is about (if that is what you want see The Pianist or Schindler's List - also excellent films).",/review/rw0330126/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2002,m_a_a_n,," Love the Movie with All My Heart!

17 May 2010,D_Burke,7," A Subset of a Much Bigger Subject That Made a Good Story
","""Swing Kids"" underperformed at the box office, received bad reviews, but today maintains a cult following. Reading the reviews from the film's 1993 release, critics seemed to be ticked off mostly by the fact that the film depicted a seemingly trivial demographic in a horrific time and place. Their argument was understandable: if such mass genocide and political corruption was taking place, why would we want to know about German teenagers who were obsessed with American swing music? My question is, why would we NOT want to know about them?",/review/rw0330126/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2003,nbj,10," Excellent portrayal of swing and moral struggle
","Anyone who has stepped on to the dance floor with a live swing band playing knows just how well Swing Kids captures the electricity of a night of swing. Anyone who has strapped on their best duds an hour earlier knows knows the romance and anticipation captured perfectly as Peter Muller (Robert Sean Leonard) dresses for his last night of swing. This movie was in no small measure part of the impetus for the swing revival in the mid 90's, and I personally get ""in the mood"" for a night of cuttin' rug with Janis Siegel's incredible rendition of ""Bei Mir Bist Du Schon"" from the film. But what makes this film truly superlative is its honest dealings with ordinary Germans' motivations for complacency towards or participation in Nazism. In Nazi Germany it was in everybody's best interest (save the Jews) to play along. From Peter's mother who just wants her to children live happily and avoid the terrible fate of their father to Thomas Berger (Christian Bale) who finds acceptance and encouragement for the first time, they do so for the reasons that would tempt each of us sorely. The horrible truth of the Holocaust is that, like the Germans, very few of us possess the selflessness and moral courage it would have required to oppose the evil tide of Nazism. Swing Kids is almost alone in its portrayal of this chilling truth among Holocaust and World War II films. Robert Sean Leonard's portrayal of this moral struggle for understanding and courage is very moving. (Of course, there's noone better at playing angst-ridden. c.f. Dead Poet's Society.) As he dances his last dance, with the weight of the world on his shoulders, the world spinning around him, he finds a rare kind of release that is perhaps found only on the dance floor. And yes, his brother's cries, ""Swing Heil! Swing Heil!"", in the final scene give me a lump in the throat every time. For all these reasons and more, Swing Kids is an excellent film.",/review/rw0330126/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2004,deanne79,10," Poignant and Thought Provoking
","I don't know how anyone can watch this movie and say it's not a good film. There are so many elements that make it great. I fell in love with this movie in 1993 when I was only 13 years old and it has been one of my all time favorites ever since. I think all actors (especially Robert Sean Leonard)did an amazing acting job. I think it is important to see different aspects of WWII and this is a unique perspective--showing how many Germans were not all of Hitlers mentality but even if they weren't in the beginning it is important to see how his brainwashing tactics eventually affected even the youngest of Germans. Anyway, I think this is an under rated film.",/review/rw0330126/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2003,ivonnsche,," it is authentic enough
","i have read the comment about SWING KIDS not being authentic. well, after doing a bit of research on this topic (swing scene in germany in the third reich) i have to say that there was quite a big scene there. yes, the film might have exaggerated a bit (the hair was not quite as long and they had to cut down on the way they dressed even though they tried as much as they could on the zoot suit front). but it is a fact that there were dances in different cafes and they didnt like the Nazi regime. so i would say give the film makers some slack and a bit of artistic freedom! they tried to portray a group of youngsters that found cure in music and stuck together in a difficult time. i really appreciated this film as normally you wouldnt know about them at all!!! two thumbs up from me as well!!!",/review/rw0330126/?ref_=tt_urv

","There would have been no popularity of the Squirrel Nut Zippers, Cherry Poppin' Daddys, Brian Setzer Orchestra or any of the other retro-Swing bands of the 1990s if it hadn't been for this seminal film beautifully acted and shot, bravo to the director. People quit dancing in the early 1960s, and by the early 70s had forgotten how. Sad but true. But there was a short revival in the 90s of the music and dance of the 30s and 40s, and we can thank Swing Kids for that.",/review/rw0330126/?ref_=tt_urv

25 November 2001,halle95,10," Heart-Racing!
","Rented this video because I like 1930's history and the drama of the story made my heart race as the characters had to decide their loyalties. As German youths are swept into the Nazi frenzy, they are forced to interpret, as an individual, what is humane and what is not, or forced to accept the Nazi ways just to survive. In the beginning the swing music is something fun and exciting, but through til the climax, it is the swing music that expresses an individual repulsion and rebellion against the Nazi mindset. A real character study of family and friendship loyalties in a time of extreme crisis.",/review/rw0330126/?ref_=tt_urv

30 July 2002,EveySK,10," A Thought Provoking Tale of Friendship, Honor, and Loyalty that got overlooked.
","Swing Kids tells the story of Peter, Thomas, and Arvid (played wonderfully by Robert Sean Leonard, Christian Bale, and Frank Whaley respectively). They all live a carefree life fueled by the American swing music of the late 1930s. But living in Germany in 1938, these boys see the change that is coming and it is Hitler's reign that first tears them apart. Peter is caught by Hitler's military police when he attempts to steal a radio for Arvid and he is thenforced to join the Hitler Youth. Thomas joins so that his friend will not have to go through it alone. They go along with the HJ way of life during the day, while still living it up in the illegal swing clubs at night until Thomas falls victim to the HJ ways and starts believing in Hitler's ways causing conflict among the boys. Arvid's loyalties do not lie with Germany and stronly opposses the Hitler way of life. Peter must decide what he believes in and come to terms with the death of his father at the hands of the government six years prior to the story. I would like to say it has a happy ending, but any story about the rise of the Nazi's in Germany can not fully end on a happy note. It is an educational film that should be examined and studied by those who want to fully understand what really happened in Germany and learn the untold story of the few who oppossed.",/review/rw0330126/?ref_=tt_urv
