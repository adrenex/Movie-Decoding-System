22 January 2019,scottsideasare,9," Good solid drama, don't get the criticism
","I'm not sure where the criticism comes from on this series. The comments critical about realism forget that this isn't a documentary. If that's your criteria then good luck with any series.
It's a well crafted intrigue with solid characters with a great mix of an overarching major plot points with excellent subplots. Episode 5 and 6 are a fabulous wrap up that leaves you guessing until the final minutes.",/review/rw4668950/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2018,lhunt-9,10," Finely crafted, highly contemporary thriller
","There is an obvious draw for stories about the aspects of our world that are changing. Aerial surveillance and drone warfare are a prime example. This theme was tackled well by Eye in the Sky, but of course, it was a feature film with a necessary resolution at the end of the story. Pine Gap digs further into this new technology, and sets the story in Australia, which opens the door to exploring the theme of international cooperation as well. So, what is life like when you're in the business of aerial surveillance, drone warfare, and risk assessment? Not unexpectedly, the characters' lives are very much like others' lives, but with this wild card factored in. Thus, much of their work is confidential. Secrecy is necessary, and may become habitual. There is always the possibility of intrusion, sabotage, mixed motives, conflicting policies. Add to that blend well-drawn and deeply sympathetic characters, and set it in an already cross-cultural Australian context (in Alice Springs). That will bring you to Pine Gap, a most compelling production, and well worth further seasons.... This is a great show well-tailored to our age.",/review/rw4668950/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2019,troy-boulton,8," Diamond in the rough.
","Pine Gap is a compelling, well written and sharply produced mini series that deserves a view from everyone into spy thrillers and procedurals/mysteries. With strong production values, this is one of ABC (Australia's) better recent series. Pine Gap is not without its flaws - it nearly lost me early on with some painfully ham-fisted terminology goofs and technical misrepresentations of technologies central to the plot. The show manages to transcend these transgressions with its strong performances, tight pacing and otherwise tantalisingly layered plot and characters, and learns to mostly back away from the dangers of inaccurate specificity in later episodes... After binging the series in 2 sittings, I found myself wanting more...",/review/rw4668950/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2018,Herbalicious_690,8," Espionage and Intrigue
","Just finished the first series. Really strong production values across the board, except the musical score which works well but is mainly underscoring background music rather than feature music. Script is intelligent while not being overly hard to follow, and there is a good balance between information the audience needs to retain for the story-details to make sense. The script is not overly dense with hard-to-follow information, but neither does it assume the audience have shut their brains down into unthinking mode thereby needing every little detail explained over and over.",/review/rw4668950/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2018,jazfro,," and you thought we were friends?
","I have only seen the first two episodes, so this review is about a work in progress.
I felt that the geopolitical context was timely and relevant for anyone living in or near one of the ""five eyes"" countries. The storyline is good, if somewhat predictable with regards to the Chinese bogeyman, but the tensions between American and Aussies are culturally accurate, if at times a little crude. The romantic sub-plot is too obvious and somewhat contrived, but I guess that's par for the course if the series takes a couple of unexpected turns (not likely so far, but who knows?). 
If you enjoyed Berlin Station, you may like this one as a remote controlled / drone version along the same kind of spy series. Not perfect, but still very watchable. And there are some spectacular views of the Australian outback.",/review/rw4668950/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2018,fmobieglo,8," Keeps you in doubt into season 2
","When I started to watch this show, I didn't know what to think of it. it didn't particularly grab me, but kept me interested enough to keep on watching. And it stayed that way until the end of season 1. And there where two cliffhangers that makes me want to see season 2 as well.",/review/rw4668950/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2018,iconians,8," Good thriller
","I enjoyed it. It was long enough to be binged through but not slow paced so you'd get bored. There are enough elements there to keep you guess. Overall story is layered and strong, good background. Strong stakes. Smart bad guys and an interesting dilemma overall.",/review/rw4668950/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2018,tim-1519,10," Excellent, but not your average spy production
",This is unusual for a spy thriller in so much as there are no car chases. no guns and no ludicrous special effects.,/review/rw4668950/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2021,Ioreka,8," Impressive
","Very enjoyable story with strong characters who make you care about what happens to them. The broader plot is credible and the atmosphere of small town Alice is intriguingly portrayed. The personal loves of the characters interweave really well with the plot and keep you interested and guessing. I often don't bother with second seasons, but I probably will with this one, even tho season 1 is nicely complete in itself.",/review/rw4668950/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2019,rwassmer-75884,8," Intelligent and Engaging
","This limited series takes a bit to rev up, but several threads emerge that are convincingly woven into a complex and convincingly real plot. The subject matter is high tech intelligence and the managers and analysts who staff a massive and isolated installation The references to current events and more or less obscure geography are on the mark and lend a sense of the real thing to the story line. The characters are nicely drawn for the most part with a few minor shortcomings. And, there are a couple of (mostly unnecessary) plot lines that are not up to the overall depth of the series. Hence 8 stars and not 9 or 10.",/review/rw4668950/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2019,Venge,8," Big Thumbs Up!
","Canadian Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau, once said, ""Living next to the United States, is like sleeping with an elephant ... one is affected by every twitch and grunt."" The new NetFlix series, ""Pine Gap"", mirrors just such a relationship between the behemoth United States, and its more modest cousin, Australia.",/review/rw4668950/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2018,jhahnel-792-286738,10," Brilliant! An historic topic brought to mainstream - finally!
","Brilliantly acted and everything we've always wanted to know about Pine Gap. The relationships between Aussies and our US counterparts is brilliantly portrayed. Thank you to the actors and people that made this happen. Forget the previous review, this is a series that gets gritty and real and shows the underbelly of the relations between the US and Australia when it comes to the long held conspiracy to what Pine Gap is about and where is where it began. A shared facility that protects the world from global threats and potential harm. Calculating and precise, with amazing accuracy and focus on current topics haunting this world with the Chinese influence on Australian politics. Be scared and very aware that the current threat and obtrusive influence in Australian politics that the Chinese portray is very real. Such an amazingly produced show. Well done to all!",/review/rw4668950/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2018,atrium72802,10," Good on ya mate!
","Don't get the negative comments from some here, this is much better than most of the stuff on Netflix imo. It is far less meandering than Homeland (which had a few good seasons) and the story line is structured and characters persona's are very obviously developed (as per the investigation). Having been to Alice Springs twice recently, and meeting fellow Americans who worked at the facility, and also seeing it from the plane, the series does seem on point, if not exactly coreect on every technical detail. The shots of Alice Springs, Anzac Hill and some of the natural geological sites that they visit (Standley Chasm and Simpson Gap) lend authenticity to the local. I do hope that they continue with this series as it has legs. If you want more Aussie thrillers try Secret City and the movies Mystery Road and it's sequel Goldstone. Crushed is also worth noting.",/review/rw4668950/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2021,zadeereviews,8," Gripping
",It's a well done gripping thriller mystery. Interesting characters and good political drama as well. Give it a go . Watch first 2 episodes and you will be sucked in. Wish they did a 2nd season but don't think it's going to happen now.,/review/rw4668950/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2018,byrdbree,9," Very compelling
","Anyone who rated this less than a 7 or 8 probably doesn't like cinema that makes them listen or pay attention completely. It doesn't spell anything out for you so you have to focus (aka put down your phone) but I think that makes for good television. There were a couple Australian colloquialism that I paused to google, but that's fun! The mystery was addicting and the character development was slow-moving but delivered in the end of the season. I enjoyed it.",/review/rw4668950/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2019,bwilliamson-61219,10," When is season 2 coming?
",We thoroughly enjoyed season 1 and were looking to find season release date. We are terribly disappointed to see negative responses. We watched on Netflix and at the end of each episode were riveted to watch the next episode. We are now on a cliff waiting for the end result.,/review/rw4668950/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2018,melaniemorrison-27861,9," Great Australian drama
","Not sure why Pine Gap is getting bad reviews. The topic is perfect for the current political climate, the acting is sensational and the location scenes in Alice Springs and surrounds is stunning.
I'm aware that life inside Pine Gap is likely to be tedious data gathering performed by a bunch of 'yes' people but that would make for tedious viewing. I like that series writers have created such dynamic, diverse, intriguing characters who have opinions about real things. (In the real world they world they would never have been allowed to work in 'intelligence'). I hope there will be a new series.... feel that there are still many loose ends.",/review/rw4668950/?ref_=tt_urv

","The negative reviews were all the same. People going on about made America look bad. This was an excellent scripted, cast, and acted thriller.
