","Among the thousands of films I have viewed, this movie would rank near the top for sheer entertainment. That's not saying it's the best-made or most intelligent or scariest or funniest or features the best effects, etc. etc. But combine all those and you have a film that's tough to beat when you're looking for 100 minutes of escapist fun.",/review/rw4595484/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2002,MovieAddict2016,9," An excellent family entertainment achievement, with the keyword family, not just kids.
","The smash hit 1995 film Jumanji- based on the children's book- is a great family film. The plot of the story involves a young boy named Alan Parrish who in the 1960's finds a supernatural board game, that was buried underground in the 1800's. Alan is instantly drawn into playing the game, and Sarah-a girl who lives close to him- also joins in the game. After the powers of the game transport young Alan into the jungles of the board game, no one believes Sarah's story of what happened, and everyone suspects foul play. ",/review/rw4595484/?ref_=tt_urv

","I just used to love ""Jumanji"" as a kid. This was what was Oscar worthy to me, because I loved the special effects and Robin Williams. Even though I think I over did it with the Oscar worthy thoughts, still to this day I enjoy ""Jumanji"".

","In Bradford, New Hampshire, in 1969, the bullied boy Alan Parrish overhears drumbeats and finds a boarding game called ""Jumanji"" that was buried one hundred years ago by two boys in the real estate of Alan's father Sam Parrish (Jonathan Hyde). Alan plays the game with his sweetheart Sarah Whittle and vanishes while Sarah flees from bats that have arrived in his mansion. ",/review/rw4595484/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2005,lee_eisenberg,7," I guess that life is a game of chance!
","You know the drill: young Alan Parrish gets sucked into a board game called Jumanji, returns when a brother and sister are playing 26 years later, and has to battle the animals that wreak havoc on the town. It all seems pretty simple, but they play some neat tricks with it in the movie. As the adult Alan, Robin Williams is more subdued than usual, but still makes the character admirable. With good support from Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, David Alan Grier, Bebe Neuwirth, Jonathan Hyde and Patricia Clarkson, this is a pretty interesting movie. I will admit that the monkeys looked pretty fake, but we can't dwell on that in this movie; the point is to enjoy oneself while watching it.",/review/rw4595484/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2021,pawanpunjabithewriter,8," A Classic Adventure-Fantasy-Comedy
","I watched this classic in 2021 for the first time. Trust me, I never felt like old boring stuff. It was truly amazing. Nor, after watching the Jumanji movies till now except for this, did I find this one to be similar. It was different. It was Classical. It was a great show. Fantastical Fantasy. Good adventure although latest ones have lot more. However, this, suprised me considering I had made up my mind of what Jumanji could be. But this was truly amazing. Although latest ones have great cast, next level VFX, astounding adventure, this one's the best. I do love the first part of the latest ones that came in 2017, I'd find rather take a tie between the two than selecting one. Thank you. However, lemme tell you, it was leaving Prime, so I watched and it was worth it.",/review/rw4595484/?ref_=tt_urv

16 November 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," Brilliant family entertainment!
","While I try not to take IMDb ratings to heart, I do think the rating for this film is too low. The film is absolutely fantastic in all departments. I will admit, there are some bits that are quite scary due to some scenes that are amazingly dark. The film does start off slowly, but when the film fast forwards to twenty six years later, the film turns into fast-paced family entertainment. Other than one or two scary scenes and the slow beginning, I could find very little wrong with Jumanji. The story is great, very intriguing and filled with humour, scares and poignancy. The cinematography and scenery are constantly breathtaking, and the special effects are extraordinary. The film is aided by a hilarious and poignant script, spirited direction, atmspheric music and the fact that it goes at a very fast pace. Even the acting was great, with Robin Williams in one of his best performances as Alan Parrish. While he is subtle in places, the director allows him to be funny, which is what he does best. Bonnie Hunt is good too and she and Williams have great chemistry, and Bradley Pierce and Kirsten Dunst are cute and lively. Plus the ending is nice and satisfying. All in all, I love this movie, even with its very minor problems, it is non-stop fast paced family entertainment. 9/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw4595484/?ref_=tt_urv

","In 1969, in a small town in New Hampshire, a twelve-year-old boy named Alan Parrish finds a Victorian-era board game called ""Jumanji"", and starts to play it with his friend Sarah. What the children do not realise, however, is that the game has strange, mysterious powers, and when Alan's token lands on a particular square he is suddenly sucked into the game. Unsurprisingly traumatised by the disappearance of her friend, Sarah runs out of the house shrieking, leaving the game unfinished.",/review/rw4595484/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2013,A_Different_Drummer,10," No No No -- its a 10
","This is one of those films which sort of faded into obscurity at time of release but will I believe over time be considered a classic. I have seen it over a dozen times. And, for the purposes of this review, the reason I mention that fact is to ask the obvious question... why? And the why is because of the narrative. It is nearly perfect. Heck, it may even be perfect. If you are going to create a hi-CGI fantasy about children, geared to the child within (so to speak) you need to jump down the rabbit-hole is a convincing way, so that there is no hope of return. This is the essence of every good ""fantasy"" from the beginning of time, from Peter Pan to Alice In the Looking Glass to the Matrix. Once you are in, it is hard to get out. And that hooks the audience. What better way to establish such a narrative than a kid's game with ""turns"" and ""dice""? Where each roll gets you in deeper? Also a great chance to watch to watch Robin Williams and Dunst before he/she became too old to play these roles; and Bonnie Hunt (great!) before her film career imploded.",/review/rw4595484/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2005,golem3,10," Jumanji  a timeless adventure story
","There are few children's movies that I particularly enjoyed  I can recount The Borrowers, Labyrinth and The Neverending Story. Jumanji, however takes a new place among children's films  in fact, it may seem that initially, Jumanji is about simplistic story about kids playing a board game. Based on a gorgeous picture book story of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg, this movie takes a beautiful magical adventure and makes it into a thrill ride that defies all natural laws.

","Jumanji is a fun and creative adventure. The filmmakers were able to expand the source material in a way that enriched the story instead of making it feel watered down. Robin Williams always does a great job playing a grown-up kid and the rest of the cast is solid, as well. This is an intense and entertaining family film.",/review/rw4595484/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2001,aesgaard41,9," Incredible !
","I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie.",/review/rw4595484/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2021,boblipton,8," Welcome To The Jungle
","Despite the revival of the title, and the pleasantly updated remakes, the 1995 version of Jumanji remains a movie I can look at when I want something fun and undemanding. While there are some problems with it, including the CGI that looked fake even back then, and some lameness in the improvised wrangling between Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, it has Williams near his peak, Kirsten Dunst during her child acting phase, Bebe Neuwirth - not enough of her - and some pleasant Peter Pan symbolism with Jonathan Hyde playing Both Williams' father and the hunter trying to kill him. In other words, there's a moral to the story that actually works.",/review/rw4595484/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2006,lordzedd-3,8," Wish they had more Jumanji history
","My only real complaint with Jumanji is where did this game come from? Who created it? I really wish they could have discovered more about the game's past, it's history. Then it would have made a little more sense. But I'm not saying I didn't like it. On the contrary, I do enjoy it very much, I think it's a cool buried treasure. The characters, the story, the effects all perfect. The cast does a great job in this movie and the concept of a strange magical board game works. I wish there was more monster animals. But the man eating plant and the giant spiders is enough to put it on my page. Robin Williams does great in this first monster movie, wish he do more. But that's just me. Anyway, in conclusion ladies and jelly spoons. This is an assume movie and you can do much worse then Jumanji. 8 STARS.",/review/rw4595484/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2016,Hitchcoc,8," Quite a Lot of Rapid Movement
","I worked for several years at a bookstore. I remember when the children's book ""Jumanji"" came in. The book jacket with the reckless monkeys was very catchy. It was a very short book, so I have a feeling that some liberties were taken with the plot. There had to be a ton of extrapolation. This is a rapid fire movie which at times takes a bit of industry to keep up with. There are rules to the game and for me, they are very hard to follow. There is also a time element that is in play here. Robin Williams, as usual, plays his character to the hilt. The kids are pretty good as well. I'm sure this would appeal to a younger audience. There is no time for attention spans to expire. The computer generated graphics are wonderful, to be sure. Those monkeys are really the stars of the show.",/review/rw4595484/?ref_=tt_urv

","Growing as a child, I used to love this movie when I had it on a video copy. I've watched it dozens of times and it's repeated viewings never fail to amuse me. I haven't read the children's illustration book this was based on, but later I did and I found it very amusing. Looking back at the movie, however, even as a young adult, I still love this film as much as anyone else even though the picture book itself is rather good.",/review/rw4595484/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2013,ironhorse_iv,7," It's time to play the game. You can't move until somebody roll 5 or 8.
","Unlike the game that has it's players being forced to play until it's finish. The movie can be easily turn off people, but it's not that bad of a movie. The CGI is not that great, and the jokes have this very corny humor to them, but getting past that, it's an entertaining film to watch. At least, it kept my attention for the nearly 2 hours. ""Jumanji"" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same: a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start creating havoc to their house and life. Only by finishing the game will make it all go away. The different between the movie and the game is the introduction of adult characters, and how the main characters (The children: Peter and Judy Shepard) on the book are now supporting cast. The movie starts out in 1969, young Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realize its unimaginable powers, until he is magically exile before the eyes of his friend, Sarah, into the untamed jungles of Jumanji. The things that come out of Jumanji are just overblown fears of what a jungle might hold for a uneducation person. Some of the things are just not that common in a jungle settling such as earthquakes, man-eating vines, and certain animals. They cut some things such as the volcano based on the book, from the movie. 26 years later he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) playing the same game. Makes you wonder what happens if its Alan turn and no body has rolled a 5 or an 8 in the game at all or a player dies. There is a plot-hole right there. Robin Williams plays the adult Alan whom rapid-fire humor makes him the most eccentric personality ever. He is great, but in this film, he's more kept back from going too crazy. It's gives the character depth so they can focus more on the story. Alan find out the world he used to know as a child, is gone as a adult. There is a very powerful nostalgia feel to the film that shows how much him being missing has effect the community. Alan reunites with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), the young girl he play the game with in 1969. Hunt as Sarah both funny and appealing. She afraid of everything, but able to show strength when needed. She is not the damsel in distress all the time, her character is pretty believable. Together with the kids try to finish the game before more people get hurt.The producers wanted to make something of this Oedipal angle - Alan, Sarah and the kids form somewhat a makeshift nuclear family - but it's haphazard, forced and totally overwhelmed by the spectacle. The truth is they could have lick their wounds and stop playing, and never finish it and still have great lives. The CGI was great for the day for the animals action scenes. The stampede, the monkeys and others might look badly done today, but it's doesn't hurt the film too bad. Sadly, the film lacks a Jurassic Park realish feel CGI to it, some of the animals, you can totally see where they distorted the UV mapping. Some things saving this movie is the fantastic music score. James Horner did a amazing job on it. The Jumanji drums are just chilling to hear, and the visual of the games first showing up with that sound are creepy. Another character that gives fresh air to the movie is Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde), a villain man-game hunter from Jumanji who quest is to kill Alan. Jonathan Hyde play as both Alan's dad and the hunter in the film. There seems to be a thematic thing than purely to cut costs in casting. It's like it's represent the conflict between the ideas of his father and the son. Alan argument with his father about attending a boarding school, and about facing the bullying he suffer in school. It wasn't until the Jumanji, that Alan was able to grow up to be a man and face all his fears, even his father. It was the most dangerous game type of chase between them that borderline like a Richard Connell's novel. Another supporting character was Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer who gives the movie interesting comedy humor when bad thing happen to his car and him. Director Joe Johnston was hired due to his ILM background, and the film was really trying to improve the special effects and visual effects department, but it's didn't live up to that. Certain visual effects like the animatronic spiders, and the robotic vine flower come out looking like puppets. The effects are clever but mildly disappointing; the creatures' movements have a hint of '50s-style Harryhausen puppet animation. Some children might find the film scary, will prove unnerving to small children, though violence per se is not a factor. Parents ought to consider keeping away children younger than 5. The movie is still a good movie for children, and still holds its hold. So check it out, and play the game.",/review/rw4595484/?ref_=tt_urv

","I liked Jumanji. It is way better than I thought it would be. The story starts out with the burying of a game in 1869. It is then uncovered by a boy named Alan, 100 years later. As he is playing it, he gets sucked into the game until someone rolls a 5 or an 8. That happened 26 years later. Now along with two kids and a woman who was playing the game with Alan in 1969, Alan has to finish the game despite all the creatures appearing out of the game. The special effects are amazing. They were effective and used well. The acting is decent. Robin Williams did a good job as he usually does. I did think that Hunter Van Pelt could've been more realistic. The music is pretty good. I always liked James Horner's music. There are only minor flaws here or there. I rate this movie 9/10.",/review/rw4595484/?ref_=tt_urv

","I decided to watch this movie with my 7 year old boys and absolutely loved it!! The movie is perfect for that age - suspense, thriller, kids, humor, and Robin Williams. I grew up watching him and miss him so much. He is amazing in the movie, and my boys really enjoyed watching it. I had purchased the game so surprised them with it after the movie and we had a fun game night. I highly recommend it for that age. The new Jumanji is geared more towards teenagers and adults with cheesy dialogues just to generate cheap laughs; this one is a classic. I wish they continued making these for kids, because the new ones are definitely not geared towards kids.",/review/rw4595484/?ref_=tt_urv
