19 August 2013,SnoopyStyle,8," unique
","I was expecting something more shocking. Don't get me wrong. This is violent and misogyny at it worst. But we've seen it all before. Especially the worldly movie reviewers that are so eager to give it a zero. If anything, it's the minimalist acting that's unique here. And not just the limited dialog but it's the movement. They don't even move that much.",/review/rw2859787/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2013,FrostyChud,," A clinical study on perversion

18 December 2019,Tweekums,9," Ultra-stylish revenge thriller from Nicolas Winding Refn
","This film, from director Nicolas Winding Refn, is set in the Bangkok underworld where a tale of revenge is about to play out. Julian runs a boxing club, which is a front for his mother's drug empire. One day he learns that his brother has been murdered... it turns out he had raped and murdered a teenaged girl and police officer Lieutenant Chang has allowed the girl's father to extract his revenge. Julian's mother is determined to have her own revenge against the father and Chang. Before the story is over several more people will die.",/review/rw2859787/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2014,BA_Harrison,1," Quite possibly the most tedious revenge movie ever made.
","Drive, the previous movie from director Nicholas Winding Refn and actor Ryan Gosling, utilised a deliberate and rather stilted style that not only resulted in a unique air of cool but which also had the effect of making the movie's explosive scenes of violence more impactful. In Only God Forgives, Refn and Gosling repeat this sparing, slow-burn technique, but take it to the nth degree; this time around the effect is to completely bore the crap out of the viewer.",/review/rw2859787/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2013,toinou328,7," An atmospheric tale of revenge, and not the sequel for Drive
","Critics have gone way too hard on this movie. Lots of violent, strange et slow films have been presented at the Cannes film festival since its creation but yet every time a film pushes the boundaries of violence while keeping its own style, most critics go mad and sometimes shout at the screening, even leaving the theater before the end and calling it ""outrageous"". This film, along with ""Anti-Christ"" is a perfect example of the type of scandals that go on at Cannes for quite stupid reasons.",/review/rw2859787/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2013,Troy_Campbell,4," A missed opportunity.
","Danish auteur Nicolas Winding Refn's first Hollywood picture Drive is one of the best films of the millennium, hands down. His Thailand-set revenge saga feels like a natural extension of that masterpiece, albeit a very boring and pretentious one. Where Drive was slow-burning and enrapturing, OGF is slow and uninteresting; where Ryan Gosling's Driver was charismatic and compelling, his drug-dealing enigma here is dull and vacuous; Drive's violence was impactful and meaningful, the brutality in this is nasty and pointless. There are, however, two shining lights that save this from being completely unwatchable. The neon-lit cinematography is simply stunning and quite often disguises the senselessness of what is actually going on, whilst the ballsy performance from Kristen Scott Thomas as Gosling's reprehensible white-trash mother is a terrific display of her versatility and deserving of a much better movie. A missed opportunity that suggests Refn is a hit and miss prospect.",/review/rw2859787/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2021,Kirpianuscus,," beautiful work
","First motif to see this film is the beautiful trip across various references. It is a majestic film about mother - son relation, about justice, revenge options and equilibrium. It is not an easy or comfortable movie. But it has a precious virtue - the details. Everything becomes a story itself. No doubts, not very comfortable but fascinating at whole. Because, in essence, it is a precise and profound inspired exploration of the themes and cinematography of the thrillers of the last decades. The Asian sensibility is the basic ingredient. So, just a beautiful work. ,",/review/rw2859787/?ref_=tt_urv

26 July 2013,sephev,9," People are missing the point
","It's a shame that people seem to be missing the point behind this film. However, on one's first sitting, it's easily done - Refn's style and pace may fool you into thinking this is a dull, slow film. The long, seemingly unending shots of actors staring into the distance may make you question Mat Newman's (the editor) talent. But what you really need to do is to look deeper into the film, because behind the extreme violence, the beautiful cinematography & production design and questionable reality, there is an interesting message. That message really depends on how you interpret the film, and differentiates from person to person.",/review/rw2859787/?ref_=tt_urv

","Julian (Ryan Gosling) runs a boxing club in Bangkok, Thailand. He and his brother Billy (Tom Burke) also do drug running.

20 July 2013,TheMarwood,2," Refn made the film he wanted to
","I will give credit where credit is due and if you're going to make an indulgent, obtuse and anti- audience film, keeping your budget at a very reasonable $4m is the responsible way to go. But beyond being fiscally responsible for his investors, Refn has taken many steps backwards, producing something very immature. It's neon lit nonsense for 90 minutes without a modicum of restraint. For a film that is so director and DP centric, it's a surprisingly lifeless film. May I suggest for the future, feeding Gosling some amphetamines or Ritalin before each scene - not Vicodin or some other opiate. If this is what Refn needed to make to get out of his system so he can then grow as a filmmaker, I understand. He made the film he wanted to. Now please show progress as the talented filmmaker you are. There's soulless generic products released every week to theaters and this is a film fueled with passion. It shows. It really does. It's a one of a kind disaster. The kind of film you can practically see the director giving the middle finger to the audience.",/review/rw2859787/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2015,Screen_Blitz,1," Compared to Drive, this one fails miserably at nearly every conceivable level
","Director Nicholas Winding Refn and Ryan Gosling reunite after their first collaboration in the art-house crime-drama 'Drive', in this psychological thriller. Ryan Gosling play Julian, a drug smuggler who has fled to crime-ridden streets of Bangkok after brutally murdering a man. There, he runs a Thai boxing club part time, while managing a drug dealing business. When his older brother Billy (played by Tom Burke) rapes and kills an underage prostitute, Choi Yan Lee, father of the victim is enlisted by a corrupt Thai police officer Lieutenant Chang (played by Vithaya Pansringarm) to kill him. With his brother dead, Julian's mother (played by Kristin Scott Thomas) gets the news and flies down to Bangkok where he sends him on a mission to hunt down the man responsible for his brother's murder.",/review/rw2859787/?ref_=tt_urv

","What a pile! I have no idea what my takeaway should be for this film. Not one character says more than 50 words. I'm not even sure who was the least terrible person. This is dark, confused, and meandering with no explanations and loads of gratuitous and graphic violence. I hated everyone in it.

","I've had three separate debates with people over the last few months about Harmony Korine's Spring Breakers. All three times it has been me trying to justify its social/cultural importance as a film and state explicitly why its message is true and needs to be heard. All three times, I felt as if I was talking into a megaphone to a crowd of deaf people. It seemed as if they already made up their minds as to what Spring Breakers was and felt no need to hear other viewpoints.",/review/rw2859787/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2013,shoutatthesky,1," pointless, boring and just plain bad.
","If you like movies that have a very weak plot, many pointless scenes, the addition of dream sequences that add nothing to the plot and only confuse, characters that are not explained and which it is therefore very hard to care about, and many shots of the characters looking into the distance with little emotion on their face and seemingly little on their mind then this is the film for you. I don't mind films that are unique and don't fit the usual Hollywood format but there are things that are essential to a good film such as interesting characters, a plot of some sort and some clue as to what is going on being given but those things are missing from this film. I was so confused and mainly just bored throughout this film. I expected better things from Gosling. And I have enjoyed Refn's other films so I am not just a mainstream film lover only but this effort was just bad film making.",/review/rw2859787/?ref_=tt_urv

16 May 2020,AlexWinterr,3," People will find meaning anything
","I typically like Refn, but this was just disappointing. The plot line is fundamentally a banal revenge tale, cinematography as always is amazing but thats just not enough to save this.
To respond to the positive reviews i'm seeing: How?
Symbology? Where? Nothing happens in this. You get presented with basic characters that have a potentially interesting dynamic, which is explored with... long surreal scenes in which the characters just stare at each other? Its sad how people won't call out a movie just because they believe that lauding a film that the ""simple plebs"" have rated negatively will make them seem like a connoisseur or ahead of the flock.
To end this: it feels like Refn tried to avoid making a mindless flick by leaving blanks for the viewer to fill in. Problem is, when 90% of the movie is a blank for the audience to fill in, the result it something that just feels plain lazy more than anything else.",/review/rw2859787/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2013,A_Different_Drummer,1," Ryan, Change Agents Before Its Too Late!
","There are those kind souls in critic-land who believe that every film, no matter how bad, has something to offer. These are same people who occasionally stop on the way home to hug a tree. This writer will look you in the eye and tell you that this is a film with no redeeming qualities whatsoever that should never have been made. Or alternatively, those that made it should be banned from ever working in the industry again. Don't even know where to start. How about the fact that the story is based on seeking revenge against a cop who ""bent the rules of justice"" to his own will and assisted in the early ""execution"" of a suspect by allowing the father of the girl the suspect had killed into the same room with him. Deliberately. Now, in the piece of insanity that passes here for a script, the brother of the murderer who himself was murdered by the father of the girl he killed looks for revenge. That's the movie. There yuh go, I just saved you the misery of watching it. The really astonishing thing is that Ryan Gosling stars. What, a gambling debt? No offers from Hollywood? I confess I have no explanation for this and I usually have an explanation for everything. My best guess is that he did it on a bet and figured it could not hurt his career because no one would ever see it. And it was a easy gig, not much dialog. The most memorable tag from the film is when the mother (of Ryans character) flies in to see the body of her (other) sun, and demands an explanation as to how this happened. Says Gosling,""Billy raped and killed a 16 year old girl."" Responds our candidate for Mother of the Year, ""He must have had a reason."" Seriously?",/review/rw2859787/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2013,Red_Identity,," Truly awful. Unimaginative, shallow, and self-important garbage
","After the reviews, I didn't really have high expectations for Only God Forgives. I expected to be either mixed or like it to a small degree like I did with Malick's To The Wonder (another film that also got very mixed-to-negative notices). To my surprise, it's a truly abysmal film. I loved Drive back in 2011, and even though rewatches have lessened it in my view, it still remains a fine film. Very aesthetically-pleasing, but also has a simple, strong story that intrigues you all the way to the end. OGF doesn't have any of this. Oh sure, the lighting makes everything look pretty, but even at a visual level the film doesn't do anything interesting stylistically. Several slow-motion shots coupled together with ambient music.",/review/rw2859787/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2013,rubenm,7," This film is pure style
","Basically, there are two kinds of films. Firstly, there are genre-pictures, using established cinematographic conventions, trying to please the audience. They may be good or bad, but are never shocking, disturbing or ground-breaking. Secondly, there are films ignoring conventions, and deliberately keeping distance from mainstream movie-making. Their aim is not necessarily to entertain, but rather to provoke, to shock or to disturb. They may be good or bad, but they don't leave the audience indifferent. ",/review/rw2859787/?ref_=tt_urv
