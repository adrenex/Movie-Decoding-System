19 February 2021,SnoopyStyle,6," interesting premise

Steve goes to buy up the drug supply and discovers that it has usual temporal effects.,/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2021,ThomDerd,7," Nice weird low-budget brahmedy
","For the ones about to watch this film here's a few things to consider: it's a nicely shot film with an interesting storyline and good acting. Pace is slow but picks up half way through and the plot keeps you interested. You 'll encounter some inconsistencies and some massive plot holes but if you're willing to put these aside, you ll enjoy it. 7,5/10",/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2021,TxMike,," A novel drug development in New Orleans.
","We watch lots of movies, often 5 or 6 a week. Most of them are recycled themes of one sort or another. This one, Synchronic, is mostly novel and that is refreshing. It also was filmed in and around New Orleans, a place we are very familiar with and love dearly.",/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2021,rmmil,3," Decent with stupid plot holes
","This film is decent, and I love ""time travel"" concept films in general, but there are few scenes that made no sense in the ""no person would do that"" kind of way, or contained too many ""coincidences"", which heavily impacted my ability to suspend disbelief for the remainder of it (the scenes in question happening about 1/2 way thru the film).",/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2021,MoistMovies,6," Could've done a lot more with the subject material
","The whole synthetic DMT aspect was something new and besides time travel i thought they were going to go even more weird with it.. But they didn't. And that's kind of a shame considering one of the many report people have from just normal DMT is talking to inter-dimensional beings or aliens.
I thought the scene where Mackie goes to the voodoo serimony would have been a good jumping off point for adding some more out there science fiction concepts related to DMT. The ending was very lackluster to me... a hero saves blah blah blah... I've seen that ending in 100x different ways.. fading into history to riding into the sunset..,.
The first half I was much more into it, would've been a 8/10 if i stopped there.. the end took two off for me. But thats because i found it bland and uninspired.
Would i recommend it... Not sure",/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2021,paul_haakonsen,5," Quite linear and predictable...
","I hadn't even heard about this 2019 movie titled ""Synchronic"" before now in 2021, as I had the chance to sit down and watch it. I read the synopsis for the movie and it sounded like it could be something worthwhile watching. So I gave the movie a chance.",/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2019,FilmFlowCritics,8," 7.5 for this ""Buddy-Thriller-Scifi-Horror-Dramady"" Movie!
","There are certain topics, that a lot of film makers avoid, because either its physically to complicated to set up rules and explain them, or they fear the possible backlash. This is why it's even more refreshing to see this approach back in cinema again.",/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2021,jayenglish-83539,6," A decent Sci-Fi-Thriller that COULD have been great.
","This is a decent movie. And that's unfortunate because the concept here is really cool and I think with better writing and less bland and uninspired directing/cinematography, this could have turned out to be a modern sci-fi/thriller classic.",/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2020,nogodnomasters,7," Allways
","The story centers on Steve (Anthony Mackie) who is a paramedic in New Orleans. He is treating a lot of people who are victims of the new designer drug Synchronic. He buys up the drug to prevent people from taking it. Brianna (Ally Ioannides) is the daughter of his partner. She takes the drug and disappears. The creator of the drug, awkwardly hiding in Steve's closet, explains {PLOT SPOILER} that it allows you to travel in time for 7 minutes.",/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv

",A slam bang premise is destroyed by terrible execution in this dreary sci-fi sludge.,/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2020,stevendbeard,7," Drama With Sci-Fi Elements
","I saw ""Synchronic"", starring Jamie Dornan-the Fifty Shades movies, The Fall_tv; Anthony Mackie-Point Blank_2019, the Falcon in the Marvel movies & tv show; Katie Aselton-Legion_tv, Our Idiot Brother and Ally Ioannides-Into the Badlands_tv, Parenthood_tv.
This is a hard movie to classify. It is basically a drama with sci_fi elements. Jamie & Anthony are paramedics working in New Orleans when they start coming across some mysterious deaths. One person is found stabbed with a sword, one is found completely burned and another is found at the bottom of an elevator shaft with his broken and scattered body parts all around him. Jamie & Anthony soon discover that all the victims had taken a new psychedelic designer drug called Synchronic-maybe there's a connection to the deaths? Katie plays Jamie's wife and Ally is his daughter. Ally turns up missing and guess what she took right before she disappeared? Anthony discovers clues that he thinks will lead him to her, but doesn't think anyone would believe him so he records what he is doing, in case it doesn't work, at least someone will know what he attempted to do. The explanation of the drugs effects is where the sci_fi elements come in and it's best if you don't know too much about it until you see the movie. The only problem I had was the ending. It left a big question.
It's rated ""R"" for drug content, language, violence and bloody images and has a running time of 1 hour & 36 minutes.
I would probably buy it on DVD.",/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv

7 April 2020,kosmasp,8," In Sync
","It doesn't happen often, but since I will be talking a little bit about the plot, I thought I'd put up a spoiler warning. I will not talk about the ending, I will not spoil anything that is not being told in general summaries. I still have different standards, when it comes to spoiling and that's why I'm ""warning"" people, before I go on.",/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2022,fedor8,," Starts very well, then quickly degenerates into slow-paced nonsense.
","The movie starts very well: intriguing, to say the least. For a short while there it appeared as if this would be another winner for the Moorehead/Benson team.",/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2021,Cineanalyst,4," Of Fleeting Interest
","""Synchronic"" is surely only worth watching if you're very much into time-travel movies, which I like to think I am, but even this one was lackluster to me. Plus, it's got Anthony Mackie. Seems like this guy is everywhere on my streaming channels lately. He was just in that other movie that appeared on Netflix lately but I decided to pass on, ""Outside the Wire"" (2021), and I delayed viewing the latest episode of ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"" on Disney+ for this one. Not that it's Mackie's fault. He seems like a chill guy--kind of an everyman quality to him, yet gorgeous and fit, but I digress. The movie's promotion seems to indicate that another guy is a co-lead here, but his character really doesn't matter. The pacing is pretty bad--wasting a lot of time on paramedic, family and medical stuff that hardly matters even in setting up the time-travel business--and overly-dramatic scoring does much of the heavy lifting early on to try to retain one's interest.",/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv

","... but it's a bad trip, mistimed and persistently incurable as 'The Time Machine' is replaced by a synthetic pill and a pair of modern day Morlocks demonstrate just how bad storytelling, film making and special defects can be - couldn't even cast a decent rock!",/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv

26 January 2021,Abfabbb,5," Hybrid
","The movie seemed like a hybrid of ""What Dreams May Come""/""Limitless""/with a touch of Wachowski's (""Cloud Atlas"" or ""Inception""). Except it didn't deliver. Some scenes were interesting and the concept had potential, but it never fully fleshed out and unfortunately stayed at the level of an hour long TV program. The dialogue was frequently muddled, low volumes ; weird accents so that it was not relaxing to have to concentrate so hard on ""hearing"" what the actors were saying. I expect dialogue problems when I am watching some British shows----but not in an all English language movie. I do not have hearing or cognitive issues and found this to be a problem throughout the movie. The opening concept of the snakebite was interesting but went nowhere ; the scientist who created Synchronic was interesting but went nowhere. The examination of the Dannelly marriage is boring. Brianna needed to be more complex and sympathetic so that the rescue was intense. I knew more about/cared more about the dog than Brianna because she only had a few lines before she disappeared. The movie does give food for thought to sci fi fans and was okay to pay for a rental while stuck inside during a pandemic. BUT----it was disappointing .",/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2021,AJ_McAninch,4," Slow and Stupid
","And don't put a charming dog in the film if your lead character is so stupid he doesn't have brains enough to know he must be holding the dog to bring the dog back. Yet he brings back an annoying brat. I know ""it's just a movie"", but that adorable dog sacrificed really pissed me off.",/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2021,bear-00997,9," Don't listen to any of the haters...
","If you're a science-fiction fan you're gonna like this movie. The story was good, the acting was good. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I've probably seen every science-fiction movie there ever was. If you'd like a good sci-fi movie, then just give it a chance and you won't be disappointed.",/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2021,nicolasmaczk,4," Poorly written, but watchable
","It was not good, but it was almost kind of watchable (from a far, drunk, or maybe even dead). The idea was probably okay-ish for non sci-fi connoisseurs, but sci-fi fans will definitely find it absurd. The characters are again, poorly written, you can't connect with them since they don't connect with each other either. It feels like the protagonist wants to save his friend's daughter just out of the blue, and the only connection you've seen between the daughter and the protagonist is a depthless conversation that he cut short. Maybe there where more, but I swear I spent more time thinking about interesting things, so maybe I missed it... I really didn't care about that girl, in fact it could have been the protagonist's plumber, it would have had the same impact. I'm always amazed that with the amount of talent out there, this kind of movie can still see the light of the day. You feel no passion and no talent, I don't know the guys who made that film, but they're certainly not getting on my ""to follow"" list",/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2021,ryleilove,10," Awakened Consciousness
","I would advise for those rating a low score, to watch this movie again after their conscious has expanded a level or two. Reading the ratings, I see so many missed the concept of the entire movie. I personally, found it to be intriguing and educational. The lead always plays a role in this genre of ""awakened consciousness"". I highly recommend this one, but depending on the way you view the world, it may or may not resonate and be a little challenging to truly understand.",/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2021,Luispei0015,8," People want original movies and when they have it they complain
","Why is it that when theres a movie with an original idea or script people complain and hate about it, because of this toxicity future writers and directors might not want to take the next step to do original ideas. Yes, the movie is not a masterpiece and sometimes it feels a bit rushed ( when Anthony M. Starts discovering how it works ) but overall it has a great concept, great actors and emotion. Just watch it and ignore the bad reviews.",/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2020,dschmeding,6," An OK movie with a lot of wasted potential
","I loved the first two movies by Benson and Moorhead. ""Resolution"" was a perfect example of how to take a miniscule budget and tell a captivating story with loads of mystery and twists and turns. ""The endless"" went into a similar direction, even incorporating parts of ""Resolution"" and mixing up genres from Thriller, Horror to Sci-Fi including a very dry humor.",/review/rw5401298/?ref_=tt_urv
