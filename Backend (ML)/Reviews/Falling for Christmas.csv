27 May 2017,dmc101,4," Can't Get Over the Physics
","Never mind the horrible acting and gratuitous gushing about how hot Vin Diesel is (at age 50 with sagging arms.. or whatever), how all the girls want to have sex with him and he's happy to oblige because he's Xander Cage who wears a fur coat in the summertime, the plot of this movie is about a device that can decode anything (seems to be a frequent theme these days, this has to be the 4th or 5th movie I've seen that has a device that decodes anything) and it's being used to crash satellites into the Earth with pinpoint accuracy. Now I don't work at NASA or Space-X and I don't have a degree in aerospace engineering, but I am pretty sure you cannot guide a satellite through re-entry to a pinpoint location on the Earth. Even if you could, it's not like it would be a hydrogen bomb like this movie portrays. It would disintegrate and land all over the map in pieces. But no, it gets sent to earth like it's being fired from a rail gun. The orbital decay would take forever even with assistance. ",/review/rw3623909/?ref_=tt_urv

","Mediocre following about one army man incarnated by Vin Diesel and with guns, girls, global domination and intense action scenes . It is packed with action sports , thrills and guns that look like willies . Cage once again is recruited by the government on a special mission .

Marke sends Cage to investigate and to foil some enemies who plan to plunge the free world into anarchy , as Xander using his natural abilities and a whole lot of position attempts to destroy the Pandora Box . He's helped by an expert team , an all-new outfit of thrill-seeking cohorts and taking on a dangerous band led Xan (Donnie Yen) . Cage must combat an intelligent organization and a powerful enemy far beyond his possibilities . Kick some ass, get the girl, and try to look dope while you're doing it.

9 June 2017,marc5477,1," What the heck is this?
",What did I just watch? I get its an action flick but was it meant for children? How can it be for kids given the sexual content? The bottom line is that this movie has power ranger quality dialog and a childish plot rolled into what appears to be a movie for adults. I cant believe it got a 5/10 rating. Perhaps only teenagers watched it?,/review/rw3623909/?ref_=tt_urv

","When Augustus Gibbons, the head of the xXx programme, is killed by a group that has stolen a device known as Pandora's Box, which enables them to de-orbit a satellite to his precise location, top former agent Xander Cage is brought back into action. He is given a team of soldiers for supports but demands that he be allowed to choose his own people.

20 January 2017,Troy_Campbell,7," The guiltiest of guilty pleasures.
","The trailer for this threequel promised dumb fun, but in reality the phrase 'dumb fun' barely covers the sort of bombastic action entertainment this extreme sports-themed flick delivers. The Fast and Furious franchise appears steeped in rock-solid physics by comparison. Yet there's a heavy tongue-in-cheek tone that ensures the utter ridiculousness of it all is playful and enjoyable, rather than eye-rolling and pretentious, á la the recent Point Break remake. The light-heartedness goes so far as to include cheeky cameos, colourful character intro screens and a few meta-jokes about The Avengers, which, along with the amount of fun the entire cast seem to be having, gives licence to the sheer insanity of the set pieces. There's a grenade party game, skateboarding on the side of a bus, sniping whilst hanging from a tree, fighting in a free-falling military transport plane, jumping over moving cars on a highway, and motorbike skiing at the beach. And that's only a tiny glimpse of what's on display. Headlining the titular comeback, Vin Diesel is clearly having a blast in hero-with-an-attitude mode—think Dominic Toretto but without the solemn family-first moral code—whilst his multicultural co-stars do their best to ham it up in the best way possible. Bollywood star Deepika Padukone is full-on femme fatale, martial arts legend Donnie Yen is a laidback arse-kicker, Aussie Ruby Rose oozes next-gen sexuality, acting vet Toni Collette snarls with glee, Nina Dobrev gives good perky nerd, and Samuel L. Jackson does, well, Samuel L. Jackson. The guiltiest of guilty pleasures, xXx: Return of Xander Cage offers up an unapologetically ludicrous action film that earns bonus points for poking fun at itself.",/review/rw3623909/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2017,SAMTHEBESTEST,6," A Typical Money Making Entertainer with Full dose of Action Stunts
","xXx Return Of Xander Cage Review : Finished watching xXx in Hindi dubbed version so my review will be friendly to Indian audience may be. I have not seen previous films of this franchise so my might won't help you but that would a plus point because my views about film will be individual and fresh. xXx Return Of Xander Cage is a typical Action drama film, which entertains you but does not impress if you are looking for something different or new. Script has nothing new to offer so obviously Kick ass Action scenes, Stunts and Dialogues saves the film from being not a Crap. So many Twists and Surprises are there in the 2nd half which are predictable. Acting field had no potential so just forget about it, but want to mention Deepika here cause she has good enough screenspace in film which actually made me feel proud as an Indian. Cinematography is Breathtaking, Visual Effects are Awesome, except couple of scenes which looks animated. Action stunts are something for which you can tolerate this film. Screenplay is good, not boring at all. Direction is pretty Good, nothing impressive but less minuses helps it. Overall it is a Typical Action Drama Money Making and Box Office Friendly Entertainer which has appeal for limited i mean Mass audience. There is nothing bad in watching it at least once, after that you can decide yourself that you want to give it a repeat watch or not (I can't give it a Repeat Watch). I'm giving 6/10* to this Action Drama flick as i think with this script a better movie can't be made.",/review/rw3623909/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2017,cruise01,8," An awesome action film with plenty of eye candy but cheesy!!!
","Xander Cage is back and better than ever in the third installment to xXx. xXx: Return of Xander Cage is an all popcorn fun action film that the audience by now should not expect any more from it. xXx sole purpose is to entertain with its pumping cgi filled action, with plenty of eye candy, and have a decent plot to give reasoning for the characters to chase and fight each other in every sequence.

",". . . Samuel L. Jackson, as Gibbons, urges Leader Trump as XXX: THE RETURN OF XANDER CAGE closes. There's a reason that Detroit was the ONLY city on Earth that Leader Trump mentioned as he was inaugurated last Friday. Viewers of XANDER CAGE are tipped off that the Second American Civil War must be fought and won in the World's one-time ""Motor City."" XANDER CAGE climaxes among the ""carnage"" of ""abandoned factory tombstones"" in Detroit, exactly as described in Leader Trump's speech. When he addressed America's Real Life CIA this past weekend, the news media reported that it was necessary for Leader Trump to pack the first three rows with his own private security guards, to avoid assassination by the CIA's Real Life Black Ops NSA traitors represented by Toni Collette in XANDER CAGE. But with Detroiters such as Dr. Ben Carson and Reverend Tom of Inaugural Benediction fame spearheading his charge, there's still hope that Leader Trump can follow in Vin Diesel's cinematic footsteps to win the Real Life Battle of Detroit!",/review/rw3623909/?ref_=tt_urv

","I went to the movie as a way of waiting for my kid who was seeing a different movie, my wife came with me. I honestly was not expecting anything buy explosions, impossible stunts and a bad story. Boy was a wrong, what we got was 2 explosions, stunts that should not be in any movie because they are not possible by any shape or means in real life, and a story that was far worse than i originally expected.

23 January 2017,bryank-04844,7," Dumb and Fun!
","Has it really been 15 years since we last saw Vin Diesel as Xander Cage, jumping off mountains and beating up the bad guys across the globe? Why yes it has. Only a few years later, we got a 'xXx' sequel with Ice Cube in the spotlight, rather than Vin Diesel. It was stated in the sequel that Vin Diesel's character was killed off, leaving Ice Cube to pick up the pieces and become the action star in the early 2000s. Now, it's 2017 and Vin Diesel makes $1 billion dollar 'Fast and Furious' movies, so Hollywood finally gave the greenlight to another 'xXx' film that has Diesel returning as Xander Cage, despite the fact that he's already dead. These things don't matter with this third installment, titled 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage'.",/review/rw3623909/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2017,sauradeep-paul,1," This movie made no sense
","This movie was awful and a massive waste of time. Physics is apparently non existent. The NSA guards are worse than storm-troopers at shooting. A huge cast but no character development at all and you get no idea of their names as well. The plot makes no sense at all. The acting is all over the place as well. Flying planes, flying cars, flying people and even a goddamn flying boat. Then there are people who definitely should have been killed but still they stay alive and then there are people who died and I don't know how. Overall, one word that perfectly describes this movie is 'pretentious'. It tries to define what's cool and what's not but fails miserably. I wanted to write a sarcastic post about this one, but this stupid movie doesn't deserve that. I hope everyone sues the crap out of the producers for creating such a godawful movie.",/review/rw3623909/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2017,soonyoongkit,1," Poor Screenplay
","With foreign investments, it did not indicate that the production house had to add in so many unnecessary foreign elements into the movie. Is it even necessary to start off the story in a Chinese restaurant? Where was the link? Foreign elements should be added if they were needed to tell the story and not simply just to please the foreign investors. They only make the story weaker. The story line of the movie was ridiculously unbelievable, and the screenplay was absolutely disappointing. The lines were so pale and redundant. It lacked what a big blockbuster movie should have. No explanation was given for many scenes, and it became very puzzling and exaggerating. This was not a small budget movie, but it turned out to be one brainless movie.",/review/rw3623909/?ref_=tt_urv
