21 May 2018,deloudelouvain,6," It certainly works better as a play than as a movie
","During the entire movie I was thinking that Fences should be a play instead of a movie. Most of the time I read the reviews on here after watching the movie, and so did I with this movie, and that's only then that I realized that it used to be a play before becoming a movie. I'm not surprised because the movie is basically people talking whole the time. You never get a minute of rest, it's all about Denzel Washington ranting and raving about everything and nothing. It sometimes feels like a monologue with sporadic comments of the rest of the cast. Denzel Washington's character isn't the most pleasant man to listen to so at one point it gets a bit boring. As far as Viola Davis winning an Oscar for best performance by an actress in a supporting role I wouldn't go that far. Don't get me wrong she's a good actress but this movie is just not Oscar material, at least not to me. But then again over the years I saw alot of movies that in my eyes didn't deserve Oscars, so it might be me with my bad taste. All in all the movie is okay to watch once, but I will certainly not watch it a second time.",/review/rw3629092/?ref_=tt_urv

","In the 50's, in Pittsburgh, the bitter and proud fifty-three year-old garbageman Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) lives a simple life in a poor neighborhood with his wife Rose Maxson (Viola Davis), his teenage son Cory (Jovan Adepo), who is an amateur football player, and his brother Gabriel ""Gabe"" (Mykelti Williamson) that is an insane man after losing part of his skull in the war. His best friend is Jim Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson), who works with him, and his estranged thirty-four year-old son Lyons (Russell Hornsby) is married and tries to survive as a musician with financial difficulties. Troy is a frustrated man since he was too old to become a professional baseball player when the leagues began to admit black athletes. He refuses to receive the recruiter of a college and consequently does not allow Cory to join college. The tension increases in his family when he confesses to Rose that he has a mistress that is pregnant. Meanwhile he has been building a fence in the limits of his real estate.",/review/rw3629092/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2017,mark.waltz,9," Back when Hank Aaron was a nobody...
","When Denzel and Viola were on Broadway in the successful revival of this August Wilson play, I would walk by the Cort theater as the show let out, wishing that I was a part of that very racially mixed audience. I was lucky enough to snag a playbill, but snagging an affordable ticket was impossible. I've stood in the back of the Cort theater for shows for standing room only, but that wasn't possible for this smash hit. In my many years of theater going, I've gotten to see one August Wilson play, ""The Piano Lesson"", learning about how the characters in all those plays were somehow connected, and that helped strike an interest in me to see all the others.",/review/rw3629092/?ref_=tt_urv

","I would give this film a good 7.5 out of 10 stars. I read some mixed reviews about this film and I'm on the side that says it's good, a bit long for what it was trying to deliver, but good. This film didn't need all of the thrills or heavy duty suspense to stay afloat. With brilliant and top notch actors like Denzel Washington and Viola Davis playing the leads their performances alone will make this film something worth seeing. Being that this film is from a stage play it's almost as if this were just a stage play done on a movie set, that's probably why it had so many bad reviews but I think the director (Denzel Washington) wanted it that way. This is purely a drama film delivered well by some of the most brilliant acting I have ever seen. I must admit, it does take a little while for the story to get good but it's well worth the wait. If you're into drama filled experiences with lots of symbolism and good acting I highly recommend this film.",/review/rw3629092/?ref_=tt_urv

It first hit Broadway in 1987 with James Earl Jones and Mary Alice in the leads, and the 2010 revival starred Denzel Washington and Viola Davis – both who reprise their roles for the movie version.

","This film is about a man. A man who carries the burden of generations of hardship, who couldn't fulfill his own greatest dreams because of the oppressive context in which he lived and who tries to close himself off from the world with fences. Tragically, in closing himself off he loses site of the changing times, he boxes his loved-ones in, and he creates an oppressive environment that emulates everything he tried to guard against. The timeless question lies within this story (adapted from a Pulitzer winning play) is: can we hate a man like this?

8 December 2016,Neil-15,," Performances outshine 'stage bound' script
","First let me say that this is a powerful, engaging film. Seemingly, however stereotypical, the opening of this movie feels like a stage play exposition. Although moving forward I found myself increasingly involved in the life of, to me, a thoroughly selfish, almost despicable, protagonist. Denzel Washington inhabits his role as one would fit into a perfectly tailored suit. The depth of his character fits him like a glove. The dislike of his ""Troy' is palpable. It is Viola Davis' performance that gives us any acceptance, and even a modicum of empathy, for his unrelenting dis- likability. Her 'Rose' is a tour-de-force and one of the most honest performances ever put on film.",/review/rw3629092/?ref_=tt_urv

","In ""Fences"" Denzel Washington plays Troy – a bitter, self-centred and selfish man in his mid-fifties who loves the sound of his own voice. They say ""empty vessels make the most noise"" and here is a case in point. Set in the early fifties, race plays a strong card in every aspect of life, and Troy feels betrayed by a failed baseball career that – in his eyes at least – looked over his skills to the colour of his skin. But Troy is also a stubborn cuss, and refuses to acknowledge that even in the 50's ""The times they are a changing'"". His cussedness puts him on a collision course with his teenage son Cory (Jovan Adepo), given his aspirations for a college football scholarship, and his mother (Viola Davis, ""The Help"") tries to keep the peace between the two of them.",/review/rw3629092/?ref_=tt_urv

","When you pair up Denzel Washington with Viola Davis on screen, you know you're in for two of the most outstanding performances you'll see all year and that's exactly what you get from FENCES. That said, if only director Denzel Washington and his crew could've figured out some ways to lessen the stage play feel to it and make this seem more cinematic. But then again, breaking out of that format is indeed usually the challenge when dealing with straight up adaptations from stage plays, just like ""August: Osage County"" a few years ago.",/review/rw3629092/?ref_=tt_urv

Whether it has been in serious, sober-minded films like GLORY, MALCOLM X, and COURAGE UNDER FIRE, or explosive action films like CRIMSON TIDE, MAN ON FIRE, and UNSTOPPABLE, Washington has given all of himself, and then some. And then, like more than a few great actors, he also itched to get behind, as well as in front of, the camera as a director, which he did in 2002 with ANTWONE FISHER, and again in 2007 with THE GREAT DEBATERS. He does double duty again for one of the most insightful and true films of 2016, FENCES.",/review/rw3629092/?ref_=tt_urv

","Did someone say ""Last year's Oscars were too white"" ? Now that we're starting to hit awards season I'm starting to hear everyone in the media say this . I don't want to stir up any controversy , and I don't know about you but when I watch a movie I watch simply as a rabid cinephile . Three thousand eight hundred reviews on this site back up my credentials as someone who may actually watch too many movies . Likewise check out my review of SPOTLIGHT which I described as a weak contender for best picture and I was speaking as a hardcore anti-theist . I was disappointed as I was shocked when that movie beat THE REVENENT to the big prize . In other words I tend to leave politics , religion and other baggage at the cinema door and judge a film simply as a piece of stimulus . FENCES however gives me the impression it's going to be over awarded simply because some people think they'll be righting all the wrongs of the world by giving it prizes . Of course it won't affect my life one way or another but even so let's be honest and say this is a fairly tedious movie ",/review/rw3629092/?ref_=tt_urv

","Because August Wilson wrote the play and screenplay, I figured this was going to be great. But it turned out to be an endless monologue of self pity. If the guy had a heart of gold or a modicum of concern for people, I may have gotten into this. I realize that Denzel Washington plays a character that has come up in the school of hard knocks and facing the evils of racism. But not only is he defeated, he openly tries to defeat everyone else in the film. Viola Davis is his long suffering wife. He's a guy that was a really good baseball player before the color barrier was broken. Maybe a star. But the times kept him from ever going anywhere. His brother is a war veteran who has suffered brain damage. He has a normal son with great athletic ability. His father betrays him when he is going to meet with recruiters which would lead to a college education. The movie looks like a stage production and Denzel delivers long speeches that he determines tell what the world is. In his eyes, it's not worth the effort. Disappointing after all the attention.",/review/rw3629092/?ref_=tt_urv

In a second before the vibrant world of Fences fades into view, the astute theater-goer will recognize the fast-paced almost narrative cadence of two characters talking as lines written for a stage play.

2 July 2017,Screen_Blitz,8," Denzel Washington and Viola Davis are the powerhouse of this riveting Broadway play-based drama
","Featuring an all-black cast, Fences is a deeply riveting domestic drama that celebrates the talent of Denzel Washington in both the acting and directorial department. Sitting in the director's chair for the first time in over a decade, Washington makes a diligent effort both in front and behind the camera to bring August Wilson's Broadway play of the same time to life on the silver screen. His efforts not only embrace the beauty of Wilson's spectacular theatrical project but effectively shed a bright life on the foibles of the African-American culture during the pre-Civil Rights era when segregation between whites and blacks defined American society. It's only too bad that Wilson who wrote the script here passed away a little over a decade prior to this production. The basis of this historical drama is a story that trims away from action in favor of a dialogue-driven narrative, an effort that focuses on the study of one man struggling to make sense of life in a world where the African-American community were victim of shallow opportunities. Set in the 1950s, this film stars Denzel Washington as Troy Maxson, a black garbageman raising his family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His family includes his stay-at-home wife Rose (played by Viola Davis), his impaired war veteran brother Gabriel (played by Mykelti Williamson), and his teenage son Cory (played by Javon Adepo) who's set to play college football. When Cory is given the opportunity, his hard-nosed father brushes it off as of result of his disillusionment for not being able to play Major League Baseball at the right age before blacks were being accepted in the league. The tensions between him, Cory, and Rose soon become more heated when they learn some dark secrets about his past.",/review/rw3629092/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2017,grantss,9," Wonderful, engaging story, with superb performances
","Pittsburgh, mid-1950s. Troy Maxson is a sanitation worker, working a shift with his best friend Jim Bono. Troy has been happily married to Rose for 18 years and they have a teenage son, Cory. Regularly popping in and out of their lives is Gabe, Troy's brother who suffered brain damage while fighting the Japanese in WW2, and Lyons, Troy's 34-year old son from a previous relationship. Troy was a baseball star in the late-1930s, playing in the Negro League, and still bears a grudge for his not being able to play Major League Baseball. He projects this, and other experiences, onto everyone around him, particularly Cory, who has the potential to be a football star. More than just influencing Cory's career prospects (adversely, it appears), Troy has a larger-than- life impact on the lives of everyone around him.",/review/rw3629092/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2017,sonjabermail,10," A universal message
","Fences, the late August Wilson play adaptation, is a movie with universal messages about life, love, family, parenting and black identity. It shows the hardship of life in a common Africanamerican family set in the suburbs of Pittsburgh and the margins of society. It carries a universal message about a disappointed father, who wants to protect his teenage son of life disappointments. Haunted by his inner demons, Troy Maxon fails to show real love, instead we see his harsh personality towards his son and his wife. Too many disappointments in the past have led him to shut off his emotions towards his family but still remaining human and adopting his extramarital child. The movie depicts a society put on the social margins, fighting everyday issues and marital problems but giving us a ray of hope about complex family relations and a young generation respecting their parents. The masterful performance of Denzel Washington and Academy awarded Viola Davis brought this universal play to the screen, giving the viewers a real movie gem and a show calling for their emotional responses and a deeper introspective in their own personal relationships.",/review/rw3629092/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2017,KineticSeoul,8," Soulful film that pierces the heart
","This is a film that isn't for everyone, especially if you aren't keen on listening to realistic and harsh dialogues for over 2 hours. This is based on a play after all. It's focused more on the banter and interactions which includes quite a bit of arguing and fighting with some cheers and singing thrown in. It's a movie that shows how the environment and deep past regrets fuiled by anger and really affect a man. And how that hatred and pain can affect even loved ones in a very painful and scarring way. If I watched this movie as just a kid before my teenage years, I would have been bored to death watching this. But as an adult, watching this put more insight and understanding to the human condition. Maybe it's because my father was a angry alcoholic, his past was full of betrayals and the loss of loved ones. He is a good man that has integrity but was full of anger and had a huge ego. Now as an adult I understand that he did the best he could as a father and as a man. Denzel Washington puts on another believable performance, but it's Viola Davis that really impressed me this time around. After playing the mean and intimidating role as Amanda Waller in ""Suicide Squad"". She plays a beautiful, loving and compassionate wife who tries to see the good in people. Her performance had so much realistic emotions and soul to it. As a matter of fact this is a soulful movie that pierces the heart. It shows the depressing side of reality but it still gives a bit of hope. I am not sure this is a film I would sit through again, but it's a impactful and tear-jerking film.",/review/rw3629092/?ref_=tt_urv

","29 years after its Broadway premiere, ""Fences"" arrives in theatres courtesy of a screenplay by the late playwright August Wilson himself. With two Pulitzer Prizes and his ten-play magnum opus, ""The Pittsburgh Cycle,"" (of which ""Fences"" is the sixth work), Wilson takes his rightful place alongside Eugene O'Neill, Edward Albee and Tennessee Williams as one of the greatest American playwrights. The focus of Wilson's cycle is African-American life across the entire 20th century, with each play taking place in a particular decade. ""Fences"" is set in the 1950's, but the time frame does not date the material.
