1 February 2009,alexkolokotronis,10," This Show Does The Impossible
","When using superlatives with this show it is totally fair. This show does something all other movies, shows, etc cannot do: it can safely apply any genre and still function as a deep and very entertaining show. As everybody episode goes by the show only becomes more addictive. It taps into almost every aspect of life. Every emotion is shown; love, hate, forgiveness, triumph and the list goes on and on. In fact this show depicts life the most realistically. The strangeness and peculiarity of the many themes perfectly displays the confusion in life and how it affects us. The show displays confusion in the clearest way making it almost impossible not to some how relate to the characters in the show. Not to mention also the series ends on one finest note you will ever see not just satisfying the viewer but taking the show to a level far and above anything else I have ever seen before. This show does the impossible twice over.",/review/rw8409272/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2005,stonedonkies,," Raw, personal conflict was never so mesmerizing
","Six Feet Under is meticulous, beautiful, daunting, and powerful. One way or another, it will connect with you, perhaps in places you didn't expect and aren't willing to expose. At times wrenching, at other times cathartic, but always staring back at you knowingly, this show stands head and shoulders above the advertising-driven fare that clogs network TV with mediocrity, token minorities, and jarring commercial breaks. It changed the way I view television, and I recommend it to anyone who's tired of the same old crap.",/review/rw8409272/?ref_=tt_urv

",As I was reading through the comments about Six Feet Under I was struck by how many people expressed how this series made them FEEL. And how many people admitted to tearing up or even crying while watching the show. I admit I have done the same.,/review/rw8409272/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2002,Bgb217,," Excellent, one of the best shows I've ever seen.
","It's hard to describe to those who haven't watched this brilliant show what it's like. Six Feet Under is simply in my opinion, the best hour on television, and one of the best shows ever. Of all time. Brilliantly written, brilliantly told, brilliantly acted, brilliantly brilliant. I've never used brilliant so much in a review before. ",/review/rw8409272/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2004,eamon-hennedy,," Magnificent and Compelling.
","A drama series about undertakers shouldn't really be compelling drama, but when I heard that this was to be a drama about undertakers created by the writer of American Beauty and developed by HBO I took notice.  Those pedigrees instantly suggest a great series and I am happy to say I am not disappointed. First of all this is television of almost redefining brilliance. The series is hard edged (some of the death scenes of the clients (i.e the guess characters whose funeral takes center stage of each episode) tends to be quite graphic, such as the auto-erotica asphyxiation scenario), the language frequently strong (the c-word has been uttered frequently) and there are many number of sexual scenes. However, unlike HBO's other golden child, The Sopranos, Six Feet Under may be undeniably adult fare, this is a series with heart and emotional integrity and is frequently very moving, but does so without dipping into the realms of sentimentality. Don't kid yourself if you haven't seen this series yet, we're not in made for television film territory here. This is dark stuff, full of disturbing dream sequences, downright strange dream sequences and sex of every kind (heterosexual and homosexual both get an equal look in here).",/review/rw8409272/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2005,morphion2,," The Complete First Season Review - Superb
","Screenwriter Alan Ball is most well-known for his 1999 film debut American Beauty (directed by another first-timer, England's Sam Mendes). His first work was a stunning success, captivating audiences all over the world and winning five Academy Awards. In 2001, the pilot for Ball's first television series Six Feet Under aired. While being considerably darker than audiences might have expected, the series soon found its fan base and secured a place in the list of all time greats.",/review/rw8409272/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,killercola,10," The greatest show in history that never got the attention it deserved
","It's that show. The unexpected hidden gem. During its time The Sopranos, Oz and The Wire garnered most of the attention on HBO. All of them great shows to be sure but Six Feet Under quietly premiered a new episode every Sunday night and would become one of the all time great shows with perhaps the greatest show finale ever. If you haven't seen this show you're doing yourself a disservice. Yes, it's that good.",/review/rw8409272/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2002,TuckMN,," Arguably the best hour on television.
","From the haunting opening strains of the incredible theme music by Thomas Newman (part of The Fabulous Newman Boys, Alfred, Lionel, Emil, David and Oscar-winner Randy -- probably the most talented Hollywood musical family ever) to the scene of the death that will be this week's Â‘client' of the Fisher family funeral home you know that you are in for a different type of viewing experience.",/review/rw8409272/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Glad I finally gave this a chance!
","I've been hearing about how great Six Feet Under is since it was on nearly 20 years ago and thought I'd finally give in and watch with the pandemic hitting and having so much free time. I'm glad I finally gave it a chance. I can now see why it won so many awards and why so many people love this show. It's about a messed up family who run a funeral home and the lives of each of the family members. Each episode begins with a death and shows the lives about that person and how they died. It really is an interesting show. While I wouldn't rank it among the best shows I've ever seen it's still a good show that's definitely worth watching. They say the writing and acting are some of the best in television history, especially Michael C. Hall & Peter Krause! It also has one of the best final episodes of any show ever.",/review/rw8409272/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2008,MaxBorg89,10," A masterful look at life through death
","For five years Six Feet Under entranced, entertained and moved audiences all over the world with its black humor, sharp characterization and flawless cast. It is now justly remembered as one of the best programs in television history, and can undoubtedly be considered HBO's masterpiece, hand in hand with The Sopranos - that's how groundbreaking its five seasons and 63 episodes were and still are.",/review/rw8409272/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2005,gus120970,," No exaggeration to call it a masterpiece
","Now that Six Feet Under is complete, it can be viewed as a totality. Whether just a convenient way of bookending 5 seasons of television, the arc of the show's narrative - starting with the death of a family patriarch and the reassembly of a family; and effectively ending with the death of his son five years later and its dispersal, provides a satisfying moral and narrative symmetry which cuts across plot line and cliffhanger devices used to propel and sustain commercial television shows. Six Feet Under had indeed completed its artistic mission of staring death solidly in the eye and viewing its from almost every conceivable angle.",/review/rw8409272/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2021,aabonander,10," Even more profound almost 20 years later
","I watched Six Feet Under when it originally aired on HBO. Hard to believe that was almost 20 years ago. At the time I remember thinking this was the best thing I'd ever seen on television. It was too good for television. It just transcended anything I had ever seen. Over the years I've recommended the show to countless others. After recommending it to another friend recently I decided to rewatch the show. I finished the series in less than two weeks and it is still one of the best things I've ever seen on TV. The effect this show has on me is even more profound today than it was the first time I watched it. This show punches you in the gut. It makes you think. It makes you reflect. It makes you question your choices. It makes you evaluate life.
A lot of incredibly great television series have come along since Six Feet Under originally aired but none of them will hit you as deep as this show.",/review/rw8409272/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is by far one of the best shows I've seen. As with every show, there were a few episodes that were dry but overall it was really good and I couldn't resist binge watching episodes! The shows final finale was by far one of the best I've ever seen, couldn't help but shed some tears. They tie everything together perfectly, I would deff rewatch this series",/review/rw8409272/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2008,PoisonKeyblade,10," The best show ever!
","Six Feet Under, HBO's most accomplished and consistently excellent show, ended a little more than two years ago. So why review the show, and learn about it now? Six Feet Under is much more than it seems. A rich show with several layers, it's all about people living their lives, making discoveries about themselves, and of course some drama, romance, and suspense thrown in for good measure. Not only is the show the best and most amazing show in television history, but it is also an incredible portrayal of human life and what it means to live. We live, we die, and the world keeps moving on. Six Feet Under is all about life and loss and all of the emotions, horrors, and realization that come with it. It is at times depressingly realistic, but it can also be beautifully true. There are so many beautiful things in this world, and if you just look or listen, you can find them. You can take joy in your life and make it worth living.",/review/rw8409272/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2002,The_Wood,8," A show that grows on you.
","Admittedly I didn't care for Six Feet Under the first time I saw it.  Alan Ball's first few episodes seemed a little too reminiscent of American Beauty.  It's not that I don't like American Beauty, in fact I love it; I just don't like to see clones.  Once you get past the similar wicked wit the two share -- you'll find that Six Feet Under is completely different.",/review/rw8409272/?ref_=tt_urv

4 January 2009,jzappa,10," You Will Find Its Rewards Owed No More Than a Handful of Superlatives That Do Justice
","Alan Ball's Peabody-winning seriocomic five-season saga is about a family with a particular blessing in disguise. Three siblings have spent their childhoods growing up with death ceaselessly in their home. And as a part of the business of death, they are on the receiving end of the grief and shock of murders, diseases, accidents and old age suffered by the loved ones of complete strangers (mostly). Each episode, save a baby's handful of significant ones, opens with the death of any given person, caused by anything from gang shootings or heart attack to too much LSD, and that death generally sets the pitch for its episode, pressing the characters to consider their present fortunes and hardships in a manner that is clarified by the death and its aftermath.",/review/rw8409272/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have seen all major TV series: Sopranos, Wire, Breaking Bad, Games of Thrones, Mad Men, Downton Abbey etc etc etc.. and this is the best show of them all without hesitation. This is an excellent drama about relationships, family, life and death. After having watched this series you will be a slightly different and better person. Don't miss this great opportunity! Don't be held back that this is an older series, invest your time and you will be greatly rewarded for doing so.",/review/rw8409272/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2022,justahunch-70549,10," Among the greatest TV series in history
","This endlessly impressive TV series about life, death, love and every other human emotion fathomable that centered around a family owned funeral home is an amazing journey from its first season to its fifth and last of which the latter contains probably the best finale of any TV series ever. This has a huge cast that is flawlessly headed by Peter Krause, Michael C. Hall, Rachel Griffith, Lauren Ambrose and Frances Conroy along with a supporting cast giving performances of equal quality. If you're new to this, ignore some of the initial episode as it offers a style not utilized in any other episode. You will laugh, you will cry, you will be shocked, you will experience every emotion there is if you watch all of this. My admiration for this very original show in a most unusual setting has no limits.",/review/rw8409272/?ref_=tt_urv
