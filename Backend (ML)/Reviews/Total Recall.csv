31 May 2020,briancham1994,7," More grounded than The Simpsons
","It's inevitable that this would be compared to The Simpsons given its time period and style. This show definitely aims to be more grounded and relatable rather than zany. It does this very well but it can alienate some audiences who want an escape from everyday squabbles rather than see more of it. Also, the characters and scenarios become more extreme in order to remain engaging, which slowly defeats the purpose of the show. Still, I enjoyed a lot of the episodes and I think it does have a life of its own outside the typical 90s ""Simpsons clone"" genre.",/review/rw4292249/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2002,budikavlan,," A remarkable creation
","After ""Beavis & Butthead"" (which I loved), I was really surprised what an affectionate portrait Mike Judge put together.  I know well how ripe Texas rednecks are for satire (being a native Texan), though the target is SO easy, it would get a bit tiresome to watch it week after week for years. Hank Hill turned out to be a realistic redneck:  worshipful of tradition, fearful of variety and progress, but not really quite as conservative as he thinks he is.  My parents are very much like that, too.  As I've watched the series, I've been tickled by different characters at different times:  first Bobby (almost zen in his bizarre but internally consistent individuality), then Hank's buddies (where the sillier satire comes in), then Hank himself (eternally thwarted by life, but always strong and loving in the end). Lately, Peggy's outrageous ego has me laughing the most.  Since this is more like a regular sitcom than ""The Simpsons"" is, I doubt it will hold up as long, but for now I love it.  ""King of the Hill"" may be the most realistic portrait of Texans ever seen on TV. In response to previous complaints: 1. While Texas does have many citizens who are members of ethnic minorities, the area of the state in which the show is set (NW Texas--best reckoning has Arlen based on Abilene or San Angelo) has very few of them. 2. If one finds the show boring, one need only change the channel.",/review/rw4292249/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2012,deatman9,7," A great show
",I really liked this show and I was heart broken when they cancelled it to make room for family guy even though I really like family guy. A lot of people don't like this show and I guess I can see why. It has a very dry humor to it which I persoanlly find very funny. Its not like your typical animated show like simpsons or family guy where crazy stuff is always happening. No its more like a live action show very realistic and it just shows people living their lives.,/review/rw4292249/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2010,dee.reid,10," Just another great animated show on FOX
","Mike Judge's ""King of the Hill"" was his next great success following ""Beavis and Butthead"" on MTV. ""King of the Hill"" follows Arlen, Texas, native and conservative family man Hank Hill, and his family and their circle of weird but likable friends. The show is also a satire of Texas life, and the sometimes absurd and eccentric attitudes of people who live there.",/review/rw4292249/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2004,DarthBill,," It's alright to be a redneck
","Hank Hill, the hero of ""King of the Hill"", is the last of a dying breed in many ways. He's reasonably honest, reasonably moral, he works hard, he believes in American craftsmanship, and he loves his dysfunctional family. And he's a conservative. He's a bit repressed emotionally though; annoying him or getting him mad is easy, but expressing those tender emotions like love is hard for him, due mostly to his upbringing by his dysfunctional and tyrannical dad Cotton, an obnoxious old man who lost his shins in WWII and somehow had his feet sewn into his knees. Hank's conservative point of view doesn't always make him easily sympathetic in some cases though.",/review/rw4292249/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2005,tfrizzell,," Getting Life Lessons Across Via the Animated Route.
","Very excellent prime-time animated series from the highly creative and brilliant mind of Mike Judge (""Beavis and Butt-Head"" fame). ""King of the Hill"" deals with a small town Texas family and their wild misadventures. Shades of ""The Flintstones"" and ""The Simpsons"" here as the show has vivid characters galore. Propane salesman Hank Hill and substitute Spanish teacher wife Peggy rear awkward adolescent son Bobby in the fictional town of Arlen. Hank has a wild World War II hero for a dad (Cotton), a niece who lives with him and his family (Luanne), a far from perfect boss (Buck Strickland), a slew of childhood friends (conspiracy theorist/bug exterminator Dale, lonely divorc√©e/Army barber Bill and often verbally incoherent swinging bachelor Boomhauer) and even Laotian neighbors. These vivid characters create a wholesome landscape of small-town Texas community life that accurately shows how lives intertwine and interweave. The situations in the series are hilarious and yet many times life-affirming as the show's brain trust do their best to have messages that center around family, friends and personal sacrifice. The running gags (Dale's wife having a torrid affair with a Native American new age healer who actually conceived her only son while her husband has no earthly clue) and the constant humanity and vulnerability of the featured characters make ""King of the Hill"" a real sight to behold. The art and science of television production combine to make a truly outstanding and intelligent sitcom for most all age groups. 5 stars out of 5.",/review/rw4292249/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2015,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,9," Funny without pushing things too far
","Most adult cartoons on TV these days are crude, offensive and repetitive (coughFamilyGuycough). Lately the two most popular cartoons for adults on TV are South Park and Family Guy. Since I'm a climate change heretic I found a few scenes in South Park to be funny as it makes fun of environmental extremism, but for the most part South Park is just rude, badly animated and probably upsetting to a lot of people. As for Family Guy, it's funny to the ""lowest common denominator"", the morons of the world who find child molestation, racism, incest and mentally disabled people to be funny. That's why I cancelled my satellite TV service. Reality shows, tasteless animated programming, and just plain stupid sitcoms have filled nearly every space of television and is making today's generation (which believe it or not I'm a part of), into idiots.",/review/rw4292249/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2005,movieman_kev,10," A great cartoon for the whole family
","This show chronicles the animated everyday adventures of Hank Hill, his wife Peggy, son Bobby, and niece Luanne. Also featuring Hank's friends, the sad Bill, the paranoid Dale, and the plain indecipherable Boomhauer, as well as Hank's father and foreign neighbors every now and then. The antithesis of all the ""popular"" cartoons of the day (the Simpsons, Family guy, etcetera), and all the better for it. This cartoon is well-voiced, heartfelt, and is great family fare. Oh yeah, and it's frequently hilarious as well. Some blast this show for being a tad more conservative then other's of it's ilk. I say so what? It's refreshing to have one counter-point in a whole sea of one viewpoint.And with the show ending it's 9 year run this season, it still hasn't outstayed it's welcome like some others *cough* Simpsons *cough* And I for one will miss spending time Sunday nights with the Hill family (on the times it WASN'T preempted by Football, of course) ",/review/rw4292249/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2019,ThunderKing6,10," King of the Hill is the King
",One of the things King of the Hill does right that Simpsons fails to do is retire while you are on top rather than drag yourself to a who cares death.,/review/rw4292249/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2019,JayPatton88,10," I hate Fox ended this show
","I loved this adult animation show from episode one to the next to last season, maybe the last season led to it being cancelled, or Brittney Murphey's death ?",/review/rw4292249/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2011,GorillaWarfare,8," The most underrated show of all time
","King of the Hill is unquestionably different from its rivals in many ways: calmer, more subtle and simple. However, what defines KotH more than anything else is its timelessness: other shows seem to benefit off referencing the news and pop culture (South Park and Family Guy primarily). KotH on the other hand, builds its plot inwards around its own characters and locations. It could be shown to anyone in the next 40 years and they would understand it as much as today. Instead of simply racing towards offending the biggest celebrity or corporation, it keeps conservative and to itself. As well as this, the characters are memorable and brilliantly crafted: Hank, an every day man who sometimes makes stupid decisions. Dale Gribble, an anti-government obsessive. Jeff Boomhauer, the most 'modern' of the 4, but who cant seem to talk properly. And finally Bill Dauterive, a slobby but likable bachelor. The one reason I gave this 8/10 is because sometimes the show doesn't always seem to 'get going' and draw you in to the plot, however this is rare and not something that should put you off the show. To conclude, King of the Hill is a show which never got the attention it deserved, and a great alternative for anyone bored of modern ultra-paced cartoons.",/review/rw4292249/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 1999,bat-5,," One of the best shows on TV.
","King of the Hill is probably one of the best shows that you're not watching. A very droll sense of humor abounds in this show about a propane salesman and his family. Along with extolling the virtues of propane and propane accessories, Hank reveres everything and anything Texan:  steak, the Cowboys, Tom Landrey.   Hank navigates life with the help of his Boggle playing wife Peggy, who is a substitute Spanish teacher.  And then there's Bobby Hill,  Hank's only son because of a narrow ureathra.  The supporting players add color to this mix.  You have paranoid, whacko Dale, lonesome Bill and Boomhauer.  Then there's Hank's niece LuAnn, his neighbor Khan, and his father, Cotton.  Throw them all together and you have a show that is worth watching.  One could argue that this show could be done as live action, I think it benefits from being animated. Dream sequences are easier to pull off, and some of the more oddball things that Dale and Cotton Hill do could only be done on an animated show.   Smartly written and full of humor.",/review/rw4292249/?ref_=tt_urv

16 December 2009,athomed,10," A show that creates and expands its own plausible world.
","This review is 13 seasons in the making. For 12 years, I was a faithful viewer of King of the Hill. It started out as a wonderful addition to a great Sunday evening lineup on Fox, it ended as the saving grace to a boring and vulgar Sunday evening lineup. This show was forgotten by Fox for five years, they cut its marketing down to nothing and then wondered why it didn't deliver the numbers they wanted.",/review/rw4292249/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2005,kapilkulkarni81,10," An excellent change from everything else
","Although we don't get this show in India, I managed to get a couple of episodes from the net. Let me tell you, this is a fine show. It deals with an upright, honest and sometimes down-on-his-luck propane salesman from Texas, Hank Hill and his quirky family and friends. But what makes this show different is that it does not have a frantic pace at which things take place. Although, I thoroughly enjoy 'The Simpsons' and 'Family Guy', yet these shows have everything happening at a breakneck speed; the gags, the animation, etc. King of the Hill somehow has a certain calmness to it. It deals with real people (5 fingers, not 4) and fairly real situations. It always puts a smile on my face and it's nice to hear Hank's pearls of wisdom. It was a pleasant surprise coming from the creators of Beavis and Butthead. I definitely recommend this show. Two thumbs up.",/review/rw4292249/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2003,chthon2,," Great show.
","King of the Hill is about Hank Hill, a proud propane salesman in Texas. When he isn't at work, he spends time with his family and three friends. The entire cast is great, and the writing is top notch.  The show is funny without going over the top.  In fact, this is probably quite a realistic portrayal of life in Texas.  One worth watching.",/review/rw4292249/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 1999,Tikiman,," Better than most non-animated shows
","Now that Mike Judge has made a fortune off Beavis and Butthead, he gets to do what he wants - thankfully his creativity extends far beyond the crude (though very funny) humor of his previous series.  KOTH has its share of humor, but I think it shines because of the perceptiveness it displays about life.  The series is full of very touching moments between Hank and his son Bobby, which rang very true with me, since I am an only child (Hank has a narrow urethra, so Bobby is his only offspring).  All in all, this is a great show to watch, and I hope it stays on the air for a long time.",/review/rw4292249/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2020,view_and_review,8," Hank Made Propane Interesting
","I only started watching ""King of the Hill"" because when I heard Hank Hill's voice I thought, ""Hey! That's the guy from Beavis and Butt-Head!"" Who knew that I would end up liking KotH even more than B&BH. I also never thought I'd be able to watch a show in which a guy talked so much about propane. Classic.",/review/rw4292249/?ref_=tt_urv

15 August 2018,justinhinson,10," A great show that doesn't push agendas!!

28 March 2022,kirstiehale,10," Intelligent humor that doesn't have to be gross or slapstick.
","I never really got into King of the Hill when it aired on television. I used to flip through the channel if it ever did come on, but I was also in my early twenties when cable became obsolete, so I'm not sure my sense of humor had ripened enough to appreciate it yet. It actually wasn't until just this week in early 2022 that I decided to put it on as background noise on Hulu. I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. It's a very funny allegory on the ""All-American family"" from the late 90's-early 00's. Growing up in the south, I knew many Hank and Peggy Hills. The humor is subtle, which is what makes it easier to appreciate. There isn't someone yelling in your face to make you think it's funny. I was quite surprised by the mediocre reviews. I suppose not everything is for everyone, but this one is a winner in my book.",/review/rw4292249/?ref_=tt_urv
