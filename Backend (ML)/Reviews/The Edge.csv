22 April 2021,aidanratesmovies,10," A Brilliant and Incredibly Underrated Superhero Satire That was Truly Ahead of its Time
","A faultless and incredibly charismatic little superhero film, Megamind may stand on the shoulders of other superhero flicks before its time, but it also provides such unique and creative differences that raise the bar higher than ever before. I have been a fan of Dreamworks Animation for a long time, I grew up watching it, and I always would prefer it to Disney flicks and other animated adventures that would come out throughout the years. Megamind is easily one of my favorite, and one of their most underrated films to date. Yes it relies on the Clark Kent vs Lex Luthor type of formula, as really most superhero films do, but it took a chance with its ambitious ideas and made it work so well, you can't help but forgive it. The film was largely overshadowed at the time by its animated competeter, Despicable Me which was a delightful surprise, but in my opinion no where near as close as smart and funny as this film. The film has such a great character with Megamind, who isn't just a bad guy, but someone who turns to bad to find a purpose- to feel fit in the world around him, even if it means being feared. The animation is fantastic and the voice work is tremendously on point, Will Ferrell (as he does with so many of his characters) brings so much life to Megamind- in a performance you will truly never forget. The soundtrack is fabulously done by veteran composer Hans Zimmer, and the script is incredibly sharp, with so many moments looking back upon that were truly ahead of its time. In the end, I feel we don't deserve a film like Megamind, but neverless we got it and it came with flair to spare. I love this film, and I encourage anyone who doubted its genius, to give it another try.",/review/rw2357380/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2012,tieman64,," Where'd you park the invisible car?
","""Megamind"" stars Will Ferrell as ""Megamind"", a super-villain who delights in his daily feuds with local superhero Metro Man. Metro Man is played by Brad Pitt, his character a suave, debonair and hilariously cheesy ode to all things manly. Megamind, meanwhile, is your classic superhero villain, only fifty times cooler and a hundred times more slick. Forget Heath Ledger's overrated Joker. Megamind's where it at. The guy struts about like a cocksure peacock, smoke machines, Black Sabbath, AC/DC and strobe lighting forever heralding his oncoming awesomeness. Megamind understands the showmanship of villainy. The wild, ego-maniacal, unbridled jouissance of it all. The guy's Id unleashed. You can almost smell his cool. He also wears mascara.",/review/rw2357380/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2011,planktonrules,8," Sort of like ""Despicable Me"" but for an older audience...
","I think that the timing of the release of ""Megamind"" hurt it quite a bit. If you look at the revenue for this film, it really is not that impressive, as it cost nearly as much as it made. However, ""Despicable Me"", which came out shortly before ""Megamind"" made a ton of money--many times what it cost to make. Now this does not mean one film is necessarily better that the other. I really think that ""Despicable Me"" stole ""Megamind""'s thunder and people were just not interested in seeing two films about an evil genius.",/review/rw2357380/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2012,blade-21,9," A well developed movie for adults and kids
","Every so often I watch a film with limited enthusiasm, simply because I have time me to kill. On these occasions I sometimes stumble across a true delight and am pleasantly surprised...a film that maybe had ""mixed"" reviews or that received little attention upon its release. Megamind is such a film; a great work of animation and character development.",/review/rw2357380/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2010,Mike_Noga,8," Megamind is the Charlie Brown of super villains.
","I am so glad that animated movies are coming back into their own. In the past few years we've seen some really good ones like Despicable Me and How to Train Your Dragon and now we have Megamind. The animation is great but what gets this film 4 stars is the fact that while the animation adds to the movie, it is only one aspect of the film's appeal. The dialog and characterization are strong too.",/review/rw2357380/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2010,ridiculonius,9," It's not HTTYD, but it still kicks butt!
","Dreamworks is notorious for creating a combination of hits and misses - their misses can be anywhere between disappointing (Shrek 3) to just plain forgettable (Monsters vs Aliens), but you'd better believe that their hits hit HARD. Their most recent release, Megamind, coming hot of the heels of the DVD release for How to Train Your Dragon (arguably one of Dreamworks' best), is, despite its poor press, a major HIT in my book.",/review/rw2357380/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2011,appubhai007,9," Different and an entertaining super hero story
",As we all know Pixar and Dreamworks are two of the best studios producing amazingly awesome animated movies. There have been few misses but megamind is not one of those. With dreamworks releasing some fantastic and original movies in the recent past like kung fu panda and how to train your dragon I knew I had to see this one since it came out and I finally got time to watch it now.,/review/rw2357380/?ref_=tt_urv

9 June 2011,claudio_carvalho,7," A Funny Animation with a Parody to the Origins of Superman and a Satire to Superhero Movies
","When a planet is near to be destroyed, two alien offspring are saved by their parents that launch them to the space in pods. Their fate on Earth is opposite: one that is a beautiful baby with superpowers crashes in the lawn of a mansion, while the other that is ugly and blue with a big head crashes in a prison yard with his companion Minion. They are raised in different environments of the Metro City but studying in the same school for gifted children. While one becomes popular but selfish and egocentric, the other is absolutely outcast by the other students. They become enemies and when they grow-up, the population knows them as the superhero Metro Man and the villain Megamind. ",/review/rw2357380/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2010,med77_99,9," An enjoyable animation for adults and kids alike
","I watched this movie tonight with my wife and kids, we really enjoyed this a lot, i found myself actually attached to the characters and intrigued by the plot. i also found myself entertained with the action scenes. my kids also enjoyed it, more so than they enjoyed the lame Alpha and Omega. I guess most of you know what the plot is, so i won't go into it. it is just fun and involves super powers and super heros battles. most of you are probably reading this to decide whether to go and see it or not, let me say, go ahead, it is worth it and enjoyable !! And i also like to add, we watched it in 2D, so im not sure how it is in 3D, but im assuming just as good if not better.",/review/rw2357380/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2011,michaelRokeefe,7," Will Metro City have a new champion?
","A lot better than I expected. Visually exciting with fun for all ages. Super-villain Megamind(Will Ferrell)and the metropolis hero Metro Man(Brad Pitt)have battled back and forth so many times; but Megamind thinks he has come up with the ultimate plan to defeat his goody-goody nemesis. Megamind plans on ending his losing streak by kidnapping pretty TV reporter Roxanne Ritchi(Tina Fey)and catch Metro Man in a copper death trap. With the city morning their hero, it is obvious the balance of living life is just not the same with Megamind in control. Megamind decides to create a villain to challenge and win the hearts of Metro City. By accident the new bad doer is Roxanne's cameraman Hal(Jonah Hill), who becomes Titan. Now Megamind is thinking he has a slam dunk for the first time to save the day. Well, some surprises are in store. Other voices: J.K. Simmons, David Cross, Ben Stiller and Tom McGrath.",/review/rw2357380/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2011,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," Heros are out, Villains are in
","I don't know if it's just me, but it seems like 2010 was the year for villains. Ever since Disney released it's classic film The Incredibles, I think people took more of an interest in the villains, what makes them tick and what their true motives are. So Dreamworks saw this idea and really took advantage. They released Despicable Me which was a huge hit and not even a couple of months later we had Megamind. It seemed like the love child of The Incredibles and Despicable Me, but I went shopping a few weeks ago and found Megamind very cheap, so I figured that I would give it a buy and see if it was worth it. I watched it this morning and even though it's not a very strong animated film, I would say that it was worth the buy. I guess it's just a great year for villains, because we're not seeing them as total baddies who just want to destroy everything and everyone, but maybe they have a soft side too and wanted to be good but their looks were a little too intimidating and their powers were just a little too over the top.",/review/rw2357380/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2011,tabiosk,10," Possibly The New Shrek!
","I don't remember the last time I enjoyed an animated movie this much! One reason being the gorgeous 3D animation-I mean...look at Minion's dome! I was gee-king inside and out on how detailed this movie is from the characters to the scenery. Every time I watch the movie, I always spot something new! Megamind shouldn't have been advertised as a full blown comedy, because this movie held plenty of deep lessons to be learned and so laughter was a little on the offside at times, but those tender moments were probably the best part of the movie! Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, and especially David Cross impressed me with their voice acting talent! I felt as though they ARE the characters...it just felt real to me.",/review/rw2357380/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2011,TheLittleSongbird,8," Not my favourite Dreamworks film, but smart and very entertaining
","As far as Dreamworks movies go, I do prefer Prince of Egypt, Shrek and How to Train Your Dragon, but Megamind is one of the studio's better movies. While the film loses its way in the story just towards the end, and slackens in the pace a tad at that point, it is still smart and very entertaining. In general, the pace is fast and furious, while the story is original and exciting. I also enjoyed the voice acting, I don't care for Will Ferell but still thought he was brilliant as the zany and very lovable titular character, while Brad Pitt also entertains and Tina Fey is suitably sassy. The characters all add a lot to the movie, Megamind for me is one of the better title characters in a Dreamworks film.",/review/rw2357380/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2010,e-elisabeth28,9," Absolutely Amazing and Funny Movie!
","First off, I must say that I am guilty of ""judging a movie"" by its trailers. I have to say it was a pretty good movie because the theatre was literally roaring with laughter.. I even caught myself crying laughing at one point. That's how funny it was. What's funny about it is that it is played out in great animation with an excellently cast (Tina Fey, Will Ferell, Brad Pitt, and Jonah Hill) brewed together to make an excellent superhero movie or spoof rather.",/review/rw2357380/?ref_=tt_urv

","For someone who is not yet in their tweens, this is a 5 star movie. For adults it is a 3 star movie. Megamind and Metro Man both are hurled to the earth from dying planets. Metro Man bumps out Megamind from a good home and lands our blue ""hero"" in prison. Megamind believes he is destined to be the villain his whole life, so he acts the role and harasses Metro Man, an unlikeable egotistical good guy as well as Metro City. After he successfully kills Metro Man and wins, his life is boring without a challenge so he creates a hero to fight himself, Titan Man.",/review/rw2357380/?ref_=tt_urv

","Megamind, a super-intelligent alien villain, at long last destroys his nemesis, the super-hero Metro Man. Instead of being satisfied, he feels empty, so creates a new super-hero.

","What I call a flawless masterpiece is a movie that is original, has dynamic characters and great comedy, megamind has all of the above, and all the actors do a amazing job at acting as the characters, will Ferrell is great as megamind, Seth rogen doesn't even sound like Seth rogen as titan, David cross is excellent as minion and of course Tina feys role as Roxanne is amazing, and this movie has a great start, great ending, great everything. If the Incredibles was the perfect superhero film, then megamind is the perfect comedy film.",/review/rw2357380/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2010,projectblue02,10," I Love Megamind!!
","I tend to watch all the new animated movies that come out nowadays. It's simply amazing to watch each new advancement with each new movie. Megamind truly was enjoyable to watch, all the details and small touches made it a wonderful show. Just the right amount of humor and seriousness, with a strong love interest. It's everything I was looking for in a movie. The character, Megamind himself, voiced with Will Ferrel makes him seriously lovable, how can we not love a silly underdog trying his best? Music for the movie I felt was perfect picks for each type of scene, they seem to give the movie much more power! I want to see much more of these characters, I've already seen it a few times in the theaters, 3D and normal, each time unforgettable!",/review/rw2357380/?ref_=tt_urv
