23 January 2008,billion_mucks,9," A Breath of Fresh Air: Review from Sundance
","For those who might not know the name, director Martin McDonagh is an Irish playwright who won the Oscar last year for his short film ""Six Shooter"" about a chance encounter on a train, and that film's star Brendan Gleeson has returned as Ken, one of two hit men sent to the medieval city of Bruges in Belgium along with his partner Ray (Colin Farrell) to rest and lay low after a hit gone horribly wrong. Ray is a miserable bastard who makes it clear he's not happy about being in Bruges, but Ken convinces him that their boss Harry has a job for them there, as well as allowing them a chance for some sightseeing, none of which improves Ray's mood. Things look up when he meets the beautiful local woman Chloe, played by French actress Clémence Poésy--you may remember her as Fleur Delacore in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire--and scores himself a date, which also goes horribly wrong due to Ray shooting off his big mouth. From there things continue to go south as Ray and Ken get into all sorts of messes and meet strange characters, all of whom will play a part in the larger picture.",/review/rw1997213/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2008,WriterDave,9," ""They're Filming Midgets...""
","...in Bruges. Two Irish hit men (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell) are sent into hiding by their British boss (Ralph Fiennes) in Bruges, Belgium after a botched job only to learn that the most damning job awaits one of them just around the corner. Bruges is a picturesque tourist trap built around the oldest and best maintained medieval city in Belgium. Director and screenwriter Martin McDonagh bleeds the setting and the material for all its worth and makes his feature film debut in superb style.",/review/rw1997213/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2008,ferguson-6,9," Plenty of Alcoves in Bruges
","Greetings again from the darkness. Award winning playwright Martin McDonagh brings his amazing writing talents to the big screen and scores with his first turn as a feature film director. The city of Bruges (yes, in Belgium) is the perfect setting for the multi-layered story. Its well preserved medieval architecture is like an character unto itself.",/review/rw1997213/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2008,jaredmobarak,8," You got to stick with your principlesIn Bruges
","I think that I will shortly be purchasing the Oscar winning short film Six Shooter from 2004. I've got an iTunes gift card for just the job. The thought occurred to me after seeing the wonderful debut from director Martin McDonagh, In Bruges. After seeing the trailer, which really worked for me, many times and wondering at how it is from an Oscar winning director yet never hearing of the name, I did some research. While he already has more little gold men than Alfred Hitchcock, his actual feature premiere is what has opened this weekend. It is Irish, most definitely, and if you have trouble with the accent, maybe you should steer clear until in comes out on DVD, however, if you can cope, this is a smart pitch black comedy. When I say pitch black, I mean black hole expanse of darkness. The trailer leads you to believe it will be an uproarious time, and while it is very funny and very smart, there is a tragic event that is held over the proceedings, lending a somber shadow over all that occurs. In the end though, it is consistent with its wit and drama, telling an intriguing story and never relying on the laughs to hide any plot point that the creators may not have wanted to work out to completion.",/review/rw1997213/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2008,kasserine,8," Nice Blend Of Drama And Comedy
","One of the problems with seeing a trailer for a film is it creates an expectation. If it raises expectations, and the film delivers, great. However, if the film is less then expected, then the viewer feels cheated. The best case scenario is the one I found myself in before I saw In Bruges. Low expectations.",/review/rw1997213/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2010,Tweekums,10," Laughter and tears in Bruges
",The idea of a film about a couple of foul-mouthed Irish hit men laying low in Bruges after one of them has accidentally killed a child in a church doesn't sound like a barrel of laughs but there are plenty of laugh out loud moments in this black comedy.,/review/rw1997213/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2008,allison-190,8," Quite Surprised.
","Going into this movie, I didn't have the highest expectations for it. However, I went to see it anyways, and let me just say that by the end credits I was completely shocked out how much I actually liked this movie. It was not only very funny but you were able to connect with the characters in a way you didn't think you would. The plot was def. very interesting and kept my attention the whole way through. Only real problem I had with the movie was that it was a little bit too long, but it didn't take away from anything. I should also say that I'm not a huge Colin Farrell fan, but after this movie I believe that he has proved that he can hold his own with the other leading men out there. I thought there were some beautiful moments that they captured on film where you see him dealing with his characters inner demons. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for something ""different"", if you're sick of seeing the same ""hollywood-esque"" movies, then please give this movie a shot. If anything, enjoy it for the witty dialogue.",/review/rw1997213/?ref_=tt_urv

4 March 2008,dianesmailusa,," Horribly Enchanting
","Martin McDonagh is a new name for me but it reeks of sounds and smells I recognize and love. Joe Ortonish if you know what I mean. A mishmash of blame and redemption in Bruges of all places. Colin Farrell is superb as the child killer devoured by his own conscience. His dialogue is brutally funny but if we follow his eyes he's stuck on the same place. The child, his death....Brendan Gleeson's interest in Bruges and what Bruges has to offer is hysterically funny and deeply moving. A monumental performance. Ralph Finnes in a totally new vest (if you forget Schindler's) comes to revolutionize the third act with a few aces up his sleeve. He is as much fun to watch as he is frightening. An unexpected treat. I highly recommend it.",/review/rw1997213/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2011,dtb,10," Great Performances and Dialogue Make IN BRUGES a Modern Classic
","I first saw the dark comedy-thriller IN BRUGES (IB) in our local multiplex back in April 2008, and I loved it immediately. No wonder writer/director Martin McDonagh's screenplay went on to be nominated for an Oscar, and co-star Colin Farrell won a Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Comedy/Musical! When McDonagh's short film SIX SHOOTER, starring Brendan Gleeson, won the 2005 Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film, I was already familiar with his plays (including the 2005 Broadway hit THE PILLOWMAN with our family's household fave Jeff Goldblum), so I looked forward to seeing Gleeson work with McDonagh again in IB. I wasn't disappointed. McDonagh's quirky, funny, soul-searching dialogue is a joy to hear. It's chock full of profanity, but the delivery renders it more comical than offensive. The filmmakers even spoof the ""adult language"" in one of the DVD's bonus features, a montage of every time the word ""F***"" is used in IB.",/review/rw1997213/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2008,Michael-Giuffre-2,8," What a Great Movie
","I've used IMDb for years but have never felt the urge to post a review until now. I had the pleasure of attending an advanced screening of this movie in NYC last night to which Colin Farrell attended. I bought the screening tickets just wanting to bring my fiancé to see some celebrities in person while not knowing much about the movie. I figured it would be a ""hard-to-understand"" foreign, indie film whose humor would be lost on a ""dumb American."" However, the truth was absolutely the opposite. My hard-to-please fiancé agreed.",/review/rw1997213/?ref_=tt_urv

","I don't believe there are perfect movies, but the ones that feel damn near perfect on first watch, and you only appreciate more and more after each re-watching over the years - these are the ones that deserve 10/10 rating. Safe to say after 14 years that ""In Bruges"" has been one of these films for me.",/review/rw1997213/?ref_=tt_urv

15 March 2008,stephen-114,10," One of my rare 10s
","The films that I find myself thinking about afterwards are of two kinds - the best and the worst. In the case of the worst I am trying to work out just why they are so bad, in the case of the best, like In Bruges, the rare 10s, they make such an impact that I cannot get them out of my head. It was only later that I realised that Martin McDonagh has, apparently, lifted his basic situation - two hit men whiling away the time waiting for instructions as to their next victim - from Harold Pinter's early one-act stage play The Dumb Waiter. However The Dumb Waiter ends when the message (the same one as in In Bruges) arrives. McDonagh then extends the scenario in quite unexpected directions, the foundations of which have been meticulously laid, sometimes by a mere throwaway line or gesture, earlier in the film. The film is full of memorable moments - dialogue, incident or characterisation - that interweave to form an indelible impression.",/review/rw1997213/?ref_=tt_urv

","Well, to be honest I wasn't sure what to expect from this film, nor am I fan of Colin Farrell, in fact I really didn't like him at all previously....but now I have a new found respect for him and with Gleason and Fienes both in excellent form coupled with a very quick and witty script and some surprisingly violent scenes, this film really has something for everyone (except the young kids).",/review/rw1997213/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2008,claudio_carvalho,7," British Dark Humor at Best
","The Irish hit-men Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) are sent by the Londoner mobster Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes) to Bruges, a medieval Belgium city, in Christmas after an awry job in London. Ray, in his first assignment, was sent to murder a priest (Ciarán Hinds) in a church, and he accidentally shot also a boy on the head. While Ken enjoys the historic city, Ray, who is in inner conflict due to the death of the boy, feels completely bored and misses his home town. Ray meets the smalltime drug-dealer and crook Chloë (Clémence Poésy), who sells drug to the cast and crew of a movie that is being filmed in Bruges, and has an incident with a Canadian tourist and later with Chloë's boyfriend. Meanwhile Harry, who has an stringent code of principles, orders Ken to kill his protégée and friend Ray.",/review/rw1997213/?ref_=tt_urv
