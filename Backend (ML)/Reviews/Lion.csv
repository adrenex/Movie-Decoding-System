","Angelina Jolie stars as CIA Agent Evelyn Salt, who is accused of being a Russian spy destined to assassinate the Russian President. When she goes on the run seeking for answers, her life is thrown into turmoil. Jolie makes a credible hero.

",Jolie kills it as Salt in this intense spy/coverup action movie. The action was well choreographed and kept up a good pace throughout. The storyline had a good flow and some twists were unexpected. The acting was good for an action movie. Overall a solid action thriller.,/review/rw2287243/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2017,Screen_Blitz,7," It is an explosive, briskly-paced spy action foray scorching with an appealing image of Angelina Jolie
","When Angelina Jolie makes her appearance on screen, chances are most people are interested in seeing in nothing but her kicking some major ass. And for those who relished in a good time of shoving popcorn in their mouth while watching her go gun-blazing in the action thriller 'Wanted' back in 2008, this one makes a sound, if slightly lesser option. This spy action thriller, helmed from director Phillip Noyce who brought his work to the screen with two Jack Ryan adaptations 'Patriot Games' and 'Clear and Present Danger', is just another one of your average trips to the land of Angelina Jolie wielding her action skills against the baddies as she fights her way through the sporadic blemishes in the script written by Kurt Wimmer. Unlike 'Wanted', this flick proceeds with a slightly more political agenda at hand, primarily the corruption uprooted from Russia since the beginning of their fallout with the United States during the Cold War. This film focuses on Evelyn Salt (played by Angelina Jolie), a CIA operative who is a living a peaceful life with her German boyfriend Michael Krause (played by August Diehl) and being held as one of the most respectable agents at her job. Her life comes crashing down when she is accused by a captured Russian agent Orlov (played by Daniel Olbrychski) of being a Russian sleeper agent with a plan to assassinate the President of the United States. With the law enforcement along with Agent Peabody (played by Chiwetel Eijiofor) pursuing her and her boss Ted Winter (played by Liev Schieber) the only one who fully trusts her, Salt must set out on a mission to clear her name.

25 July 2010,zetes,5," Dunderheaded action picture
","It almost seems as if it were scheduled to make up for the headiness of Chris Nolan's Inception (yeah, I know, it wasn't THAT smart, but compared to the vast majority of American blockbusters...). It's pretty much a Bourne rip-off. It stars Angelina Jolie as a CIA agent who is exposed as a Russian sleeper agent by a Russian defector. Whether she is one or not, her bosses (Chiwetel Ejiofor and Liev Schreiber) decide to keep her under wraps. She'll have none of that, though, as she fears for the safety of her spider expert husband. So basically, like Bourne, it's about a defecting agent running from her employers while simultaneously trying to foil the bad guys. The film does have a couple of semi-clever twists, but it also contains a metric ton of stupidity. There's no real set-up for Jolie being some kind of Bourne-like superwoman, yet as soon as the action sequences start she's either MacGuiver or Jackie Chan. Weighing in at about 95 pounds (seriously, Angie, eat a burger) she's able to beat the everloving crap out of every trained CIA, FBI or Secret Service agent who gets in her way. The filmmaking is reminiscent of Bourne, but, unlike Bourne, the choreography is confusing and implausible. Very little of the plot makes any sense, from the reason for the initial exposure to Jolie's motivations to the final sequence. Any moderate examination reveals the film to make no sense whatsoever.",/review/rw2287243/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Delivers the action... Awesome plot!
",I found this thriller to be enjoyable. Lots of action - some of it pretty unbelievable - and some twists in the story. Very well acted on all parts. I really like Jolie much more in these action movies than the dramas she does.,/review/rw2287243/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2010,classicalsteve,6," Entertaining Action Thriller But Die Hard Becomes Die Never; Also the Plot Development Gets a Little Unbelievable
","When Bruce Willis makes crash landings in the original ""Die Hard"" movie, at least he winces in pain and it takes him a few moments to regain composure. In ""Salt"", when Angelina Jolie jumps consecutively onto six moving trucks on the freeway, she's flying right up and instantly running at Olympic record pace, sort of like the original Terminator except sporting lipstick. Throughout the movie, she decks secret service agents faster than they can graduate out of combat training if she's not pushing out of moving vehicles going 70 mph while wearing handcuffs, although the officers forgot to put the cuffs on behind her. They put them on in front of her leaving her with a slight chance to get away. I guess the point of this movie: don't try this at home.",/review/rw2287243/?ref_=tt_urv

24 September 2017,TheOneThatYouWanted,8," Salty Spy
","Not sure why this film is not as well received as it should be. It is about an American CIA or FBI agent who is compromised in order to set off a series of events leading to global chaos. This film has a lot of moving parts but is handled well and it is very entertaining. The action is well choreographed and shot without annoying shaky cam. Plus it is non- stop. This film didn't do well enough to merit a sequel, which is a shame because this is an outstanding example of a kickbutt film with a strong female lead. I guess that sort of thing wasn't trending hard enough back then. Sad how Hollywood is using important issues as a mean to market films nowadays. But what is sadder is how people buy into it. Anyway this is a great spy thriller worth checking.",/review/rw2287243/?ref_=tt_urv

19 August 2010,chrichtonsworld,6," Popcorn entertainment nothing more nothing less!
",While I was expecting a little more sophistication in the plot department I realized that such a thing couldn't happen when US versus Russia is at play. (To my knowledge the Cold War is over and the spy business has become more complicated than ever. This oversimplification of old enemies and their wars is too much.) The plot is all over the place and realism is thrown out of the door. There are too many things happening in the movie that are too convenient and even impossible. Still it didn't keep me from enjoying this movie. It even managed to thrill me at occasions even if I was aware that most of the plot was nonsense. Jolie does an excellent job as the action heroine. The action is that makes this movie tick and that is almost the only thing that should count in a movie like this.Ignore the bashing and trashing of Jolie. This is pure entertainment!,/review/rw2287243/?ref_=tt_urv

27 August 2010,geekroad,7," Good Action Flick
","Many reviewers here have stated that this movie isn't realistic because 'Salt doesn't get bruised enough' or 'no one her size could...' Have these people ever been to an action movie before? NO ACTION MOVIE IS REALISTIC. They are all written to be over-the-top because that's what makes them entertaining. We suspend disbelief to enter the world of the action-hero (or heroine) and we go along for the thrilling ride that is sometimes so over-the-top it's ridiculous! But that's what makes it fun. If action movies were realistic, they would be slow and boring. This movie does not cross the line anymore than any other action movie.",/review/rw2287243/?ref_=tt_urv

",Salt is a very good action movie and the plot actually scared me somewhat. It occurred to me that this is a possibility that any country could do to America in the future.

12 May 2018,The-Sarkologist,8," A Thrill Ride
","I saw this film in the cinemas a while back and didn't really think much of it. However I watched it again recently and was really impressed. In fact I was a little surprised that I hadn't written a review of it them, but that is probably a good thing because it means that I can now return to this film with a fresh mind, and a fresh opinion, and also give it the rating that it deserves.
 The film starts off in North Korea where Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent, is being tortured. It appears that she is going to be left for dead, which is to be expected, until a surprising trade comes about and she is released. A little later a Russian diplomat comes into the CIA to offer some information, and suggests that there are a number of Soviet era sleeper agents in the US, and proceeds to finger her as one of them. This is where the fun starts.
 Throughout the film you are never quite sure what is what and who is who. In fact you are never really sure whether Salt is working for the Russians or not, and I won't reveal whether she actually is. In fact you never know who is a sleeper agent and who isn't, and there are some very interesting revelations that come out through the movie, leading you right to an action packed ending.
 In a way we are seeing a post Cold-War Russia, but the thing is that the old Soviet system has never really gone away. One of the targets in the film is the Russian President, and there is a suggestion that he is actually Boris Yeltsin, and a part of me suspects that there is a group within Russia that wants to return to the Cold War era. While there wasn't anything particularly said about what was going on, there was this idea playing in the background.
 The really interesting thing was the suggestion that American diplomats in Russia during the cold war were killed, and their children taken by the Russians and brain washed before being handed back to the United States (or even switched). This was what was insinuated in the opening scene where Salt is speaking with the Diplomat. In reality it is unclear as to how many of these sleeper agents are present, because it seems that the United States government is unaware of how many of these children were brainwashed. Not surprisingly, they made their way into some very influential organisations.
 This is one of those movies that could easily be considered one long thrilling ride from beginning to end. In another way, one wonders how it is that the United States is unaware of something odd going on, if the parents of all these children are incidentally killed. I'm sure after a few there would suddenly be some questions being asked. The other thing is that some people turn out to be agents, even though there was no real hint from the get-go - sometimes I feel that maybe there should be some hints so that it doesn't come out hugely unrealistic. Still, this was a great film, and other that kept me at the edge of my seat all the way through.",/review/rw2287243/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2010,EmilyMoulder,," Jolie proves she can play rough in Kurt Wimmer's Salt

7 August 2010,dtucker86,," Salt is one ""peppery"" heroine
","The people who wrote this film apparently don't think the audience is very smart. They want us to believe that Angelina Jolie who is about five foot four in her bare feet and 100 pounds wringing wet is capable of beating up and shooting about sixty people, crawling around a ten story building on a narrow ledge, jumping from tractor trailer to tractor trailer and climbing down a ten story elevator shaft! Boy she is one tough, ass kicking mama! Some people have said this movie is merely a clone of the Jason Bourne movies (one reviewer waggishly called Salt Jason Bourne with a vagina). However, Jolie makes her role distinctly unique. She holds this movie together with cool intensity that would rival any actor. The plot is convoluted and hard to follow but there is enough action for five movies, so just sit back and enjoy the ride. By the way, for you history lovers, there really was a theory that Lee Harvey Oswald had a Soviet lookalike who was the real killer of JFK and there really is an underground bunker below the White House.",/review/rw2287243/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2010,BigWhiskers,3," Disjointed mess
","I went into this thinking Angelina Jolie looks hot and it will be exciting. Instead it's an overblown mess with jerky camera angles and a plot so convoluted that you could drive a car through the plot holes. Ms Jolie plays a spy for the CIA who turns out to be a Russian sleeper cell spy as well. So she runs and runs and runs and sports a black wig and expensive sunglasses like a character from the Matrix. And they do what I always hate in movies , they zoom in during the fight scenes which makes it all blurry and jerky ,what's the point.By the end of the movie I was so put out especially with the shameless setup for a sequel, Jolie running off into the woods,fade to black.I left the movie theater thinking I'll bet critics like that windbag Ebert will like this movie yet trash another movie that is way better.

21 February 2011,Tweekums,7," Far fetched but contains plenty of excitement
",Salt is a fairly standard spy thriller; as it opens CIA agent Evelyn Salt is being freed from a North Korean prison and soon things are going well for her. Things turn worse though when a Russian agent walks in claiming that Salt is in fact a Russian sleeper agent planted many years previously. At first the CIA don't believe him but when Evelyn runs it looks as if he may have been telling the truth. As the drama progresses it look more and more likely that this is the case and her actions could start a war. She isn't the only potential sleeper agent and as the drama reaches its conclusion the viewer is left wondering whether Salt is an enemy agent trying to reach her target or whether she is in fact racing to protect the target from the true danger.,/review/rw2287243/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2017,cmovies-99674,8," I have seen this film many times on multiple occasions and it never seems to disappoint.
","PROS: This movie really is captivating to say the least. You're always on the edge of your seat, whether you are intrigued with the characters, or the action scenes. There is a little bit for everybody. The build up in the movie was great as well, from begging to end this movie never lets go of that tension it has built up. What also really helped this movie was the lack of plot holes. With a blockbuster hit like SALT, the director normally has no problems leaving big plot holes in the script, but this film doesn't do that. This movie was thought out immaculately. Last but not least, lets also give a shout out to Angelina Jolie (SALT) for giving her best performance in years. Any movie critic can give her credit for her Oscar winning performance.",/review/rw2287243/?ref_=tt_urv
