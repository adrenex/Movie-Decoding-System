9 December 1998,Spearin,," Mama told me not to come
","Remember when you were in grade school and the weird kids down the block were doing something that looked, well, interesting, and your mom told you to stay away?  Did you?  Did you ever wonder what it was they were up to down there, behind the garage, in the basement of someone's house, over by the bowling alley?",/review/rw0419101/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2003,SanTropez_Couch,," I wanted to hate it, but I ended up loving it.
","I described ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover"" as part of the urine in a bucket movement of art. That's not quite fair -- Greenaway had an obvious craft, intelligence, and eye for stunning visual beauty. This film, however, is urine, with or without the bucket. Its makers would no doubt hide behind that mask of ""realism,"" and that's fine. But does anyone who sees this movie come away with anything other than awfulness? That's what I asked myself about ten minutes into this film. Does the movie reveal great truths about us or the world in which we live? Maybe, though I'm not quite sure. If this movie has any value to the average moviegoer, that's it.",/review/rw0419101/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2010,chaos-rampant,," Punk filmmaking at its scummiest, who's to say this is not genuine gutter art?
","Harmony Korine did this when he was 24 years old and everything else aside I like it a lot that a young person gets to tell us what it can be to be young. Irrespective of whether or not a young man has yet found something important to say at 24, I don't like it that professional directors' careers start well into their thirties. There's a big age gap there that is only talked about in hindsight, after the fact. Perspectives and values change as we grow older, whether or not a young man will mature to the point of recognizing the follies and dreams of his youth or he'll embrace the anger and grow up to be GG Allin, and whether or not settling down to a regular life is a personal betrayal of a former self, I think something like Gummo needs to be made and more of it.",/review/rw0419101/?ref_=tt_urv

10 January 1999,cjshan,," A Surprisingly Unique Movie
","I will admit that the reason I rented this movie was because of the numerous reviews that I read about how unbelievably bad and pointless this film was.

23 March 2005,howie73,6," Startling
","Set in Xenia, Ohio, Gummo feels like a deliberate riposte to Hollywood by its creator, Harmony Korine, whose penchant for subversion was already evident in his screen writing debut for Larry Clark's Kids (1995). Eschewing linear narrative, Korine explores, through the use of vignettes and bizarre episodes, the cat-killing escapades of its two protagonists and weaves this quest around a set of unrelated but bizarre events taking place in Xenia. There is no sense of a story, only a mood, and that mood fluctuates wildly from revulsion to surprise. By giving voice to those marginalized from society, Korine paints a startling portrait of landlocked America, one at odds with the Hollywood cliché of its inhabitants. There are many unforgettable scenes and yet it's not an enjoyable film, but it challenges, provokes and pushes the margins - and that in itself is worthy.",/review/rw0419101/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2011,tiimbitz4786,," Life, Death and Alienation in Xenia, OH
","In the first minute of the film, a cat is picked up by the neck and is drowned in a garbage can of water, a scene which sets the tone for much of what is to come in director Harmony Korine's debut feature. The reviews about Gummo tend to center on the sideshow that is the grotesque nature of the film's imagery. There can be no doubt that Korine has set out to shock and horrify his audience, but if you can get past the almost violent nature of the repulsive imagery, there is a lot of meat left on Gummo's bones. Gummo may not be a masterpiece and it's certainly not for everyone, but at its core it's an effective and poignant meditation on life, death, and various forms of alienation which cause some to live as though they aren't really alive in the first place.",/review/rw0419101/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2011,lukeanilsson,," Glimpse of inbred Americana
","Gummo is a nonlinear narrative centered around the residents of Xenia, Ohio. After a tornado devastated their town the surviving residents pass the time by any sadistic means possible. A long day of feral cat hunting ends with a brief discussion of crème brûlée before a session of glue huffing, followed by a visit to a local prostitute suffering from Down Syndrome. It's as if Deliverance and Apocalypse Now had a child, abused it, and left it to its own devices. Horrifying is a word that comes to mind when attempting to evaluate this film. Drunken chair-wrestling, random acts of molestation, and casual conversations ranging in topics from cat burnings to their general dislike of African Americans are pretty typical. The only thing more trash filled, filthy, and septic then their homes, is their gene pool. Life in rural Ohio has never seemed so nihilistic. Though disturbing, I found this to be a quietly beautiful film. Both hyper-real and utterly surreal, it's stylized aesthetic is perfectly suited for the subject and premise. Rich symbolism and unforgettable images demand ones attention in an unrelenting assault on the Status Que. Unsettling and humbling, we are given a glimpse of inbred Americana straddling the border of malignant sadism and total insanity. The story telling style of Harmony Korine reminds me of the work of Terrence Malick, with the addition of a little incest.",/review/rw0419101/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2000,Smith568,10," Pure unadulterated genius served with unreserved love.
","GUMMO is the tightest, most consistent, and honest portrayal of youth's quest for love in a society that has forsaken them ever made. Forget the comedy, forget the outstanding photography, forget the heart stopping art direction. This movie is about the little people forgotten between the cracks who seek acceptance amid overwhelming obstacles of hatred, crime, poverty, disease, and twists of fate that leave them alone and groping for comfort. Almost every character is screaming out for love in one way or another, however dysfunctional their lives may be. All of these issues are real - even if exaggerated in the film - and there are thousands of kids out there who in their own beautiful way are trying to live their lives despite the cruelty of a world that will just crap on them. The next time you watch this film, look for the tenderness between the mayhem...",/review/rw0419101/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2021,IDKflycasual,7," A bizarre film
","After every scene you have to ask ""what in the flying f--- am I watching?"" It IS unique art though and deserves some stars for that. Absurd to the nth degree with no particular plot or story line. Much of it could be described as hilariously entertaining in the same disturbing way that watching two dogs fight over a chicken bone could be. I laughed my a-- off through most of it, but near the end it got sad. You start to feel guilty for mocking these miserable people. But, mostly you come away asking ""why do people reproduce?"" and wonder how much better this planet would be without us abysmal creatures running around wrecking the place.",/review/rw0419101/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2005,eddie-177,9," Give the swine what they bellow for
","If you've never lived in a small midwestern town (predominately white, predominately poor) then I suppose that the immediate power of this film would be lost on you, though it's really not that hard to translate the myriad of sick and twisted characters in Gummo to whatever community you live in. I have been a poor white person my entire life and although I've never come across a retarded girl being pimped out by her brother or a pair of kids killing cats to sell to a Chinese joint for meat, I have cut through the back yards and sat beneath the windows of the buildings where these kinds of things may very well have happened. They most likely didn't, of course. But they just might have...",/review/rw0419101/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2009,moonspinner55,1," The cinematic equivalent of scab-picking...some see this as Art
","Years after a tornado has wiped out much of their small town in Ohio, leaving behind nothing but memories and decay, a group of young and old characters react in different ways to the boredom and vacuousness that has settled in around them. The kids torture and sell cats, lift weights, and listen to death metal music, while the addle-pated adults seem to have killed off all their brains cells from one substance or another. Made for just over a million dollars, writer-director Harmony Korine's independent film is preconceived to shock with its depravity. To Korine's credit, the stultified atmosphere of the piece is arresting, the cinematography is scarily good, and--though the amateur acting is sometimes facile--the foul, stunted vocabulary and heartless aimlessness of the characters seems pretty truthful. Chloë Sevigny has a small part (and also designed the costumes!) playing a platinum blonde flirting with a skinny, pasty jock who tells her he has ADD; when Korine relaxes a little bit and just engages in their talk (or in sibling roughhousing, or jumping around on the bed to Buddy Holly's ""Everyday""), ""Gummo"" manages to work a bit of primitive magic. However, the main objective (as I can tell) is to show the bestiality which arises in human beings who have nothing else to do but lash out. The anger and betrayal these kids feel isn't necessarily addressed verbally (they seem too uneducated to process a genuine thought or articulate their emotions), but it is visualized for us, sometimes graphically. Viewers can argue endlessly whether or not this depiction of human waste is Art...whether or not it is exploitation, common huckstering, completely dishonest, or enlightening. I certainly can see an askew sense of talent (visual talent, anyway) hovering around the movie's edges, but not much entertainment value. If apathy and abject indifference in our society is really this bad, then there's no hope for any of us. The lunatics are running the asylum. * from ****",/review/rw0419101/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2002,HumanoidOfFlesh,9," Hollywood brainwashed you all!
","Young Harmony Korine,who wrote ""Kids""(1995),made his directional debut with this truly bizarre low budget piece of art about young people in small town of Xenia,Ohio.The main characters-two boys(Solomon and Tummler)kill cats for fun and break into a house to euthanize an old woman.Other oddities on display are a man who pimps his retarded sister,a strange shirtless boy in pink bunny ears etc,etc.I love ""Gummo"",because I'm in the position of enjoying everything what is different and controversial.Almost everything today is corporate Hollywood trash with an overblown budget and overpaid actors/actresses.It's truly a refreshing change to see something original like ""Gummo"".Of course it is intentionally outlandish,often repulsive and occasionally hilarious,but it's a treat,if you're fed up with MTV-oriented banal Hollywood crap.Personally I love the soundtrack of ""Gummo""-great death/black metal stuff(Burzum,Bethlehem etc.)Especially Bethlehem is an unique band.They play totally depressing death/black/suicide metal with some of the sickest vocals ever recorded.It's truly an amazing music-check out especially their albums like ""Dictius Te Necare""(1996)and ""S.U.I.Z.I.D""(1998)!So if you don't mind to see something different,watch ""Gummo""-you'll love it!",/review/rw0419101/?ref_=tt_urv

18 September 2001,Dan_Shearing,10," Uniquely compelling film that is not for people with closed-minds
","Well, I'd heard a lot about this film before I bought it, but nothing I was told really prepared me for how different this film is from anything else I've seen. On first viewing, Gummo appears to be a collection of random events, but after watching it a few more times, it it becomes more obvious how each scene and character link together (although there are still a few that I am unsure of!!). The nearest analogy I can think of is of a music album. Each scene is like a song that can be enjoyed on its own, but when the album is listened to as a whole it becomes much more than just a collection of songs, all linked in their own way. Plus, like a great album, the more times you listen\watch, the more you get out of it.",/review/rw0419101/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2006,pentagore,8," Pretty convincing
","I must say I was pretty shocked when I first saw this film. I grew up in various small towns in Oklahoma and have encountered people very similar to those portrayed in the movie. It was like going back in time and seeing all those twisted characters all over again. So yes, there are indeed people just like this, if not worse. I had to convince myself several times that I was NOT watching a documentary! I found that the use of raw black metal music added to the grim feel of the movie, particularly when the two kids are whipping the dead cat hanging from the tree. Hey, if you've never seen bored Southern youth, then don't think this stuff doesn't happen. I only wish it didn't.",/review/rw0419101/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2018,cgearheart,10," Very misunderstood and moving film
","Harmony Korine's feature debut suffered very harsh criticism when it was released due to it's non-linear storyline, non-professional actors, frequent use of different unusual cameras, shoestring budget, and an array of several different disturbing topics that seem quite disjointed and sordid. The movie itself is not for all tastes mainly because it deals not only with the breakdown of a town, but because it's about how not every place in the USA is an American dream and how poverty, boredom, abuse, death, loneliness, disaster, and a lack of healthy relationships can complete destroy and desensitize a whole community and turn them into a band of crazies. The film is a moving and unpolished tapestry of broken lives and the random insanity that occurs in those portraits.",/review/rw0419101/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2004,chris-m-c,," Misunderstood Genius
","Gummo is a film of substance, a rare thing in this time of Estee Lauder actresses and pec enhanced tree trunks stumbling around the kindergarten dialogue.  Reality TV before it became anachronistic.  A film that demands a second viewing to truly understand the director's vision is a rare thing; my initial impression was of a mockery of Red Necked America, but now after several viewings I understand it as a celebration of the sidelined aspect of American culture.  Unafraid to pull its punches, unafraid to deal with the shocking, the jarring, the discomforting; it is a film that is mostly about killing cats and sniffing glue.  Possibly a freak show, but one done in the style of the old freak shows - the freaks call the shots and they revel in their opportunities.  A piece best enjoyed at 5 am on a Sunday morning after burning the midnight oil, when your nerves are raw and you need something with bite to cut through the fog.  Nobody has created such vivid set pieces and each time you review the film there is a new mullet to admire, a chair to be beaten, a Down's Syndrome prostitute to mull over.  Prepare to be shocked and provoked whilst being entertained; when the film finishes you are compelled to take stock of what you have seen and in my eyes that is what films are for.  A hearty thumbs up.",/review/rw0419101/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film is a unique moment.  People who knock it for lack of ""plot"", or characters have missed the point.  For a start the characters are an incredibly rich mixture of people and personalities, who are far more interesting than most Hollywood blank, 2D, characters.  While there may not be a plot, it doesn't need one because the different stories it tells weave together perfectly and you get a great picture of the town and its residents.",/review/rw0419101/?ref_=tt_urv

","SPOILER: Don't let anyone tell you you're close-minded if you hated this movie.  This movie was, beyond an inkling of a flicker of a shadow of a doubt, egregiously awful.  There are always going to be wannabe artsy types out there who claim to see things other people don't; they ""get"" movies like Gummo, or at least they pretend to, so they can act as if they're in on something the rest of the world just isn't smart enough to understand.  The truth is, though, that there is absolutely nothing to get.  This movie is not innovative, nor intriguing, nor even interesting in the least.  There's no underlying meaning to it at all (writer/director Harmony Korine admitted as much in an interview).  It's just a loosely continuous assembly of vignettes depicting random scenes of filth, squalor, and depravity.",/review/rw0419101/?ref_=tt_urv
