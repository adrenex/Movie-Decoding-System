24 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Another excellent superhero movie
","This is a movie that surpasses the original one on many different levels! It has a better villain, a better story and, most of all, a better message. The movie is about Peter Parker who loses faith in what he does, so he loses his powers. Tobey Maguire is magnificent in this movie and he plays so well off of all the other actors in the movie. Alfred Molina is great as the villain and, as always, J.K. Simmons steal every single scene in which he is present. This is really one of the best superhero movies that has ever been made.",/review/rw2148543/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2009,kirk-246,10," Outstanding sequel.
","The first and third 'Spider-Man' movies were simply fantastic.But it gets even better with 'Spider-Man 2'. It's full of action, has plenty of adventure, and is full of award winning special effects.Like any other super hero sequel, there's always a new villain.The villains name in 'Spider-Man 2' is Dr. Octopus.AKA Doc Ock.He has 4 mechanical tentacles that can flip cars and throw people at great distances.Does he remind you of anything? Of course he does.What does he remind you of? An Octopus... Duh.It may sound kind of stupid, but Doc Ock's character actually helps the movie become a 2 hour roller-coaster ride of a movie.Just remember that Spider-Man can do whatever a spider can.",/review/rw2148543/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2018,EddyTheMartian007,9," Still The Best Spider-Man movie, and one of the best CBMs.
",Spiderman 2 is the best Spiderman movie. To me it feels more like a movie about Peter's struggles of being Spiderman. This was the movie which cemented my love for the character.,/review/rw2148543/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2014,drawlife,10," The best one out of the trilogy.
","Sequels are very tricky. They're very hard to crack open, but every so often we do get a sequel that is better than the original like Empire Strikes Back, The Godfather Part II, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Aliens, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Dark Knight, and others.

14 February 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,9," Mature, nuanced and layered; the superhero genre at some of its very best.
","It's hard to decide whether or not I prefer this film to the first, as it tells - in some ways - a more mature, nuanced and layered tale, but what isn't hard to decide is that 'Spider-Man 2 (2004)' is a fantastic movie and easily one of the best sequels of all time. The villain is wonderfully rounded, his motivations constantly clear and his character arc drawn in full before the credits roll, and presents both a physical and psychological challenge for our hero. The story expertly balances the phenomenally fun yet still emotionally resonant web-slinging sequences (a high-speed train in danger provides one of the feature's nicest character moments whereas the whole 'bank' section is amazingly accomplished and thunderously entertaining) with the relatable central dilemma of our very human protagonist. Raimi's directing seems to be stepped up a little, too, as he leans further into his own quirky style - evident in the renowned 'surgery' scene which is one of the best in the entire film. The entire piece just gels together to make a cohesive, complex and rare example of the superhero genre at some of its very best. 9/10",/review/rw2148543/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2016,Leofwine_draca,8," Raimi's superior sequel is comic book excellence
","Sam Raimi greatly improves on his previous ­SPIDER-MAN flick, investing this one with twice the excitement, drama, and character tension. It feels like he was playing by the rules with the first movie – following the studio's plans, never stepping out of line. Here we see the artist at work, delivering some great moments of cinema. There's even reference to Raimi's earlier horror career with buzzing chainsaws and severed limbs in the tense, quirky hospital showdown.",/review/rw2148543/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2014,utgard14,9," ""I believe there's a hero in all of us.""
","Being Spider-Man is wrecking poor Peter Parker's life. He's had to give up his chance at love with Mary Jane, he can't hold a job because he's always late, his grades are suffering at college, his Aunt May is struggling with the loss of beloved Uncle Ben, and his best friend Harry blames Spider-Man for the death of his father. All of this leads to Peter deciding to give up being a superhero. But a new threat rises in the form of mad physicist Otto Octavius, dubbed Dr. Octopus by the press, that may force Peter out of retirement.",/review/rw2148543/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2014,SnoopyStyle,8," Fun Compelling Popcorn Movie
",Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is struggling to make ends meet and having a hard time keeping his secret. He can't even keep his pathetic pizza delivery job. Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is having some success on Broadway. Meanwhile Harry Osborn (James Franco) hasn't lost his hatred of Spidey. He is now funding Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) and his work on fusion. However something goes wrong in his demonstration and a new villain is born.,/review/rw2148543/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2009,gigan-92,10," Truly Outdoes the First
","Wow. That's all I can manage to say after watching this film, wow. This movie really blew me away in all its aspects. The performances were top rate, especially Alfred Molina's portrayal of Dr. Otto Octavius. He really knows how to play that comic book villain with a sense of understanding so to speak. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst romance is a truly interesting and different outlook on being a super hero. We often dream of being super heroes, and yet here we see just the opposite. The audience feels Peter's conflict between protecting the innocent and letting his own life suffer or letting it go and living the life he's always wanted. To get everything he ever desired, he must give up his double-life. Despite whether he gives up being Spider-man or not, he will still forever have to deal with the complication of his dying friendship with Harry Osborn( James Franco). Franco is my favorite actor in this film, a young millionaire dealing with the death of his father, his friend being the only one who can help him bring the murder to justice. And yet, unbeknownst to him, his friend is actually the wall crawler himself. A extremely well done screenplay. Sam Raimi adds touches of humor to the story and it blends in quite well.",/review/rw2148543/?ref_=tt_urv

14 July 2004,Quinoa1984,10," Better than the first- Sam Raimi proves his cool knack for balancing elements of action, drama and comedy
","Spider-man 2, at least, accomplishes one thing above all else- this time, when the Spidey flings himself through the air, it doesn't look as fake as it did in the first film. If anything, this time I did feel the exhilaration that the filmmakers intended. They, being the team at Edge FX, have taken the huge lot of profit from the first film, which became the smash of smashes in the comic-book movie genre, and on that end the film is a success. But even on the human front with characterization the film is a bit of an improvement, which is always tricky for a sequel to do. Two major action sequences involving Spider-man (Tobey Maguire) and his nemesis, Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina, in a compelling turn), are shot and edited to a wonderful, creative impact. And, in an interesting bit when Doc Ock escapes a hospital, echoes of Raimi's Evil Dead comes through with subtle, if grin-inducing touches. The work done on the villain as well as the hero shows, and it helps that Ock is a sleeker, more threatening presence with his mechanical arms than the weird madman in Willem Dafoe's performance.

29 September 2009,blacklist-1,10," Spider-sequel-tastic
",My presumptions of a sequel to a successful original are that they are worn out and are a desperate attempt to cash in on it's predecessor. Look no further for conclusive evidence with the terrible Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen to know what I'm talking about.,/review/rw2148543/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2012,classicsoncall,8," ""I believe there's a hero in all of us...""
","Well I just need to know one thing - who thought it would be a good idea to have a seventy seven year old grandmother hanging from Doc Ock's tentacle as he clambered up a city skyscraper? Seriously, didn't anyone consider that she might have had a HEART ATTACK?!?! Come on, and then she hung from a ledge using a wooden cane? I'd like to know where in the realm of remote possibility this could happen. As the Marvel geek opined, 'Nuff said'.",/review/rw2148543/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2019,amazingkick,10," Bravo Sam Raimi & Sony
","This by far one of Sony's best work om the character of Spider-Man alongside Spider-Verse. A great interpretation of Spider-Man. It is a film that focuses on what matters. The character. Sam Raimi took everything that worked about the first Spider-Man movie and made it so much better. We see a Peter Parker with relatable problems. We see a man that never loses his will and never gives up ACTUALLY give up. He literally can't catch a break. And when he does catch a break and has his confidence boosted it feels so satisfying. This Peter Parker is probably one of the best if not the best character in the whole CB Genre. Doctor Octavius is man which Peter idolizes not only on his work in making the world a better place but also in his love life. Think about it Otto and his wife are a shadow reflection of what Peter wants. When Otto's wife dies and Otto goes insane all he wants is to rebuild the machine that made him proud, that made his wife proud. Harry's development in this movie is completely amazing he goes from being a best friend to absolutely hating Peter and being completely broken from the loss of his father who he so much wanted to impress. Bravo Sony. Bravo Sam. Thank you for giving us this masterpiece. Thank you for giving your soul into making this movie amazing. Thank you for making our childhood and adulthood amazing with this classic.",/review/rw2148543/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2020,J49afc,10," My favourite film of all time
","Inspired by the recent news about Tobey's likely return to playing the web-slinger in the MCU's Spider-Man 3, I rewatched this film. An IMDb score of 7.3 for this film is one of the biggest injustices I've seen on this website. In my opinion this is THE definitive and THE best superhero film of all time.",/review/rw2148543/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was a kid when I watched this in cinema back in 2004
I just want to say after all these years after a few version of Spider-Mans and all the MCU movie.
This one is hands down the best Superhero movie.
It has everything done within 2 hours. Perfectly caught up what it left of from the previous Spider-Man and Toby Maguire will always be my Spider-Man.",/review/rw2148543/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2012,StevePulaski,9," With a brain in its head and style on its side, this is one hell of a ride
","Spider-Man 2 is an adrenaline-packed cinematic delight. A purely functioning superhero film, serving as a sequel to a film that was surprisingly capable after spending a fourth of a century in development hell. Not only is this one of the best sequels I have yet to see, but one of the strongest superhero epics of the decade.",/review/rw2148543/?ref_=tt_urv

2 November 2020,gusgusedu,10," Go watch this movie right now
","This movie it's not just a good superhero movie, but a great film. The source material has been analyzed, and overall studied so It would make the fans happy, but a great superhero movie understands that this is not just for the fans, It's for the whole public, so the screenplay and the dialogue that sometimes sounds a little corny is very well writen. The CGI effects still looking good at this point, watching Spider-Man swinging around it's just amazing. Peter Parker's story arc it's perfect, for the people he interacts with he is just another nerdy guy who doesn't understands the meaning of puntcuality, but for us (the audience) he is the perfect protagonist. This movie is made by someone who understands the character and undertsands about cinema, and that man is Sam Raimi.",/review/rw2148543/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2005,MinorityReporter,8," Takes every element from the first film and improves on it!
","It only happens very rarely that a sequel surpasses the original (Terminator 2, Star Wars Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back) and after the relative disappointment that was the original my expectations for the second film in the series had decreased. When I finally did sit down in the cinema to see this film I was a bit anxious. But my anxiety was quickly put to rest because Spider-Man 2 took the premises from the first film and improved upon them all. The first Spider-Man film a well meaning picture but quite as good as it could have been the second film is a good film for both hardcore fans like myself and the broader audience.",/review/rw2148543/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2004,WilsonLau,10," Spider-man some more... please!
","After being very impressed with the first one after some skepticism, Spider-man 2 is tackling a sequel with great anticipation and even greater expectations. The way Sam Raimi was able to produce the story of Spider-man with such style, realism and above all, faithfulness to the Marvel original comic is tremendous to say the least. The reason why it took this long to make a live action movie for Spider-man is due to the difficulties in making the action sequences look real and being able to connect all the side stories and characters in a single effort. Although it doesn't look flawless, it is still able to fool the eyes. The characters are also faithfully represented.",/review/rw2148543/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2008,freemantle_uk,10," The best Spiderman movie
","I'm a big fan of comic books and comic book conversation when done right. Spiderman is on of the best comic best to be made and is an important cultural figure and important to Marvel Comics. The first and the third films were both good, the first was an introduction and the third really underused Venom. Spiderman 2, like X-Men 2 is best in the film franchise.",/review/rw2148543/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2009,TheLittleSongbird,8," Almost as good as the first film, with terrific visuals and a (I think) superior story
","I really enjoyed the first film, despite its unevenness in the script, and its length. This sequel is almost as good as its predecessor, and for me one of the better sequels out there. If there is one thing that I do prefer over the original, despite the rather slow start, I do think this film has the stronger storyline. The script is in general very good too, but the only other real problem I have with this film is its length. Despite the flaws, it is a pretty darn good action sequel. Two things made this movie as wonderful as it was. One was that it was terrific visually and technically, with splendid special effects and jaw-dropping stunts. The final action sequence between Spiderman and Dr Octopus was in particular brilliantly staged. The cinematography is focused and makes the film even more a wonder to look at. The other was the villain Dr Octopus, superbly played by Alfred Molina. Dr Octopus is made into a rather complex villain, after the death of his wife Rosalie, and becomes a villain after being part of his own invention. The music was also dramatic and fun. The remainder of the performances were very good too, while not admittedly the most charismatic actors ever, (Sean Connery is definitely a contender for that) Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst still give believable lead performances. All in all, a very good sequel. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2148543/?ref_=tt_urv
