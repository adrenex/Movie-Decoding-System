",Yes this game has flawes. I think the game is too long and because of that the pacing suffers sometimes. I also disagree with some minor decisions that were made.,/review/rw5847804/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2020,laragrace-17567,10," DONT LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS
","It's painfully obvious that people who are giving this game a low rating, didn't play/finish the game and are simply going off of the leaks or some nasty word of mouth.
The Last of Us 1 introduced us to some amazing characters and gave them character and depth. This phenomenal sequel has done that same thing, in a different light. Ellie, is still Ellie (and she has always been gay, I don't see how people think this is new news), but now she has grown up and continues to grow through this story, just without Joel. This game isn't supposed to be light-hearted or even fun to watch. It's supposed to make you angry, sad and confused. Joels death is sudden and heartbreaking, which is the brutal truth of what life is like, especially in a post apocalytpic setting. Joel killed lots of innocent people in his quest to protect Ellie, and the consequence of doing do eventually caught up with him. Now Ellie is following down that same dark path, as well as Abby, and in the end? Ellie loses everything. Her family, even her goddamn fingers which were used to play the guitar (one of the most important things Joel ever taught her). Her quest for vengeance, costed her her humanity. As for Abby, she was forunate enough to pull through in the end with Lev, only because Lev showed her that she didnt have to kill or get revenge to be happy. Sure, Abby's story was obviously a retcon, but Naughty Dog clearly didn't account for The Last of Us 1 to gain such a cult following that they had an opportunity to make a sequel.
The Last of Us 2 showed us that even our most beloved characters are only human, and can become the monsters of their own stories. I mean take a look at Tommy at the end. Ellie BECAME him. He lost his sight in one eye and will never walk properly again, yet is STILL out for revenge and in the end? He lost it all. Maria, his community, his self respect.
Self destruction is the biggest killer in this game.
Its an extremely mature story for an immature audience who dont want to take the time of day to really THINK about why these things happen. Why did Ellie let Abby live? Because she finally realised that no matter what she does to Abby, Joel will still be dead. No matter how many people she kills, Joel will not come back. So she lets her go, and moves on, but at what cost?
Give the game a chance. Grow with it. Learn from it.
Its a masterpiece.",/review/rw5847804/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2021,M_Exchange,2," One word for this one
","I vowed to myself when this one was released that I would wait to pay only $20 for a copy because I read bits about it that were depressing. Well, it happened recently on eBay. So now I experience the disappointment myself for the cost of a good meal. I should have opted for a good meal. But like so many of you who knew that you were going to hate it, I loved the first one so much, that... yeah.",/review/rw5847804/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2020,P97,8," Flawed but definitely had it's moments
","Now i do understand what most of you think about this game because of what druckman said, this one is all about hate and even i was really upset and disappointed after you know ""the thing"" happened but if you actually continue to play the game it all make sense and it's not like you are not getting any joel and ellie moment, you should know that joel in the first game did a lot of messed up things with no mercy even if it was out of love and his past is coming to hunt him in this game which was always the case, he's not a hero guys even if you want him to be.",/review/rw5847804/?ref_=tt_urv

22 May 2021,Chewbaccaccino,," Weird writing
","I find it pretty interesting how anyone who is giving this a positive review is leaving a 10/10. Not a 7, not an 8, or a 9. Always a 10, claiming that it is a masterpiece or one of the best games ever made, which is actually ridiculous. This game has certain good aspects from a technological standpoint, but just because a game has good graphics, does not mean it is anything special. Any competent AAA developer will make a great looking game. The gameplay is rather uninteresting, it's very similar to the original and does not accomplish anything special. These factors are not bad by any means; they are good, but they don't accomplish anything in the gaming industry.",/review/rw5847804/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2020,Zubacz,2," This should not be part of the canon
",The first game was a masterpiece and ended perfectly. The only thing that's good about this game is the graphics. The story is simplistic and disjointed. The characters somehow completely changed their personality and now make illogical and stupid decisions. The new characters are ridiculous.,/review/rw5847804/?ref_=tt_urv

","When this was first announced, man was I excited. The first game, although a little slow and clunky to play had the greatest story, I overlooked the gameplay that I didn't enjoy because I wanted to see more of the story, I wanted to see how it ended.
I was excited to see how Ellie has grown up and was excited to see she was going to be the protagonist, amazing, or so I thought.",/review/rw5847804/?ref_=tt_urv

","I just finished it and I am utterly disappointed at what they did with the story . This game is just a visually beautiful mess and tortures you for loving the the first one . I guess Joel says it best in the first game . He actually says "" The sequel was terrible "" and it certainly is because they could've gone a thousand different ways . 2020 is certainly not over yet .",/review/rw5847804/?ref_=tt_urv

","The first game is arguably the best game of the generation (inarguably in the top 5). This sequel has no choice but to be compared to that and it is AWFUL. To be fair, if it weren't a direct sequel to the first, we'd be looking at 1.0001/10.",/review/rw5847804/?ref_=tt_urv

22 June 2020,abdullabuhamad,4," My Least Favorite Naught Dog game!
","First of all I love the first game it's my favorite game of all time I liked the characters the story even the soundtrack everything was great! But Part 2 left me with a Major disappointment, the graphics, gameplay, soundtrack, acting were great! But the story and the narrative was a complete mess and the characters are hard to understand some characters just do things that are not what there meant to do, as a last of us fan am deeply disappointed that the game has to be ruined because of shock value or undeveloped ideas! They tried to be dark and deep but it turned out to be cringy! I'm definitely not looking forward for a continuation to this mess! Overall I'll rate the game (4/10), the first Last of Us game is still going to remain as my favorite game of all time and am going to pretend that this mess never happened!",/review/rw5847804/?ref_=tt_urv

13 July 2020,JLEV-IMDB,2," *This game is a hate letter to fans of Joel and Ellie*
","The Last of Us Part 2 is a betrayal. It undermines the beautifully ambiguous storytelling of the first game and dishonors what Joel and Ellie had to survive and endure. It takes these beloved characters and ruins them to hammer in that Abby was no worse than Joel, Ellie was no better than Joel, and Joel was a villain. In contrast, themes like revenge, violence, and forgiveness all ring hollow in this sadistic game.",/review/rw5847804/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2020,themeganlh,5," As a fan, I'm just sad.
","As a fan of the first game, I was absolutely HYPED for this game. When The Last of Us 2 opens up, you get a beautiful world, familiar soundtrack, and the return of both of the characters we all grew to love in the first game, Joel and Ellie. For the first 2 hours of gameplay, you feel right at home in the world. But it soon begins to fall apart. It is hard for someone who has replayed the first game multiple times to realize that the sequel is not up to par. TLOU is about characters and story. Many people, myself included, did not play the game for the gameplay, which is just like a lot of other games. It was the story and the chemistry between Joel and Ellie as a father-daughter duo that drew us all in. Part two feels like it completely disregards the relationship established in the first and the characters seem to change personality and consistency just to further the plot along. There are times where the characters feel like a different character entirely and I was left thinking, ""(insert character name) wouldn't have done that. They were smarter than that.""",/review/rw5847804/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2020,nadblaster,3," How to ruin your budding franchise
","How to ruin your once-great franchise in four easy steps:
Step 1: Introduce a new character that nobody likes, who does something in the beginning of the game that is so awful every single player will feel anger, sadness, and grief.
Step 2: Spend the next two hours barraging the player with teen angst and awkward romance, then a clumsy, boring tutorial.
Step 3: Let the player forget about Step 1 for awhile by moving hamfisted story to the back burner and letting the player have fun for awhile, then bring that awful character back and force the player to endure several hours of hand-wringing in an attempt to make them like that awful character.
Step 4: Pull the biggest rooster-tease of all time with the ending, which will satisfy exactly nobody.",/review/rw5847804/?ref_=tt_urv
