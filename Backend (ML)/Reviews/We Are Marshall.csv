7 November 2017,johnaskew,1," Shocking second series
","Am gutted at the trash this series has pushed out to the public. The last season gave us hope that the next set of instalments would build into a rich story of the land, the lore and the characters. Unfortunately the first two episode I watched of season 2 will be my last, terrible costumes, amateur acting from some of the newcomers and the dialogue....why would a bounty hunter set in this period of a fantasy use cheap street talk from the 70's? Enough...I am bitterly disappointed I was hoping for so much more....",/review/rw3390772/?ref_=tt_urv

","*general sort-of spoilers throughout* I wasn't hoping for much with this series, but I was expecting something like a teenager-filled legend of the seeker kind of thing with a bigger budget. This was just...no. I haven't read the books so I can't comment on their relation to the show. However, I can say that they weren't good at all. The first two episodes had terrible pacing; at first nothing was happening and then halfway into episode 2, 2 major characters are revealed without any breathing room or reaction time from the main characters. I'd heard the visuals were good, so i was at least looking forward to that. The location scout did a good job and the cgi artists did more or less OK with what they had (for a TV show) but the whole production design is pretty awful. I'm not sure what they're going for with the elves design-wise but there's a complete lack of any sort of motifs, color scheme, etc, that unifies them and makes them stand apart..other than a sort of vaguely modern 70's flower child look. (still not sure how elves are supposed to be different from humans, other than the really cheap-looking ears, because they never bothered to explain it) ",/review/rw3390772/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2016,mhorg2018,2," Barely watchable
","First, I'm not a fan of the Shannara books. I gave up on them sometime after the second book. I also don't think Terry Brooks is a good writer at all. But, since the adaptation of a book to a show rarely is the same, I figured I'd give it a shot. After four episodes, I'm giving up. There are three decent actors in this, Manu Bennett, John Rhys-Davies and James Remar. The rest of the cast is pathetic. Add to this the horrible modern day language like ""I'm freaked out"", and that just helps ruin this. The cheap production values also hurt. But over all this is just bad. How many times will the same character be captured by the reavers? That's just lazy writing. This is the first show I've attempted to watch on MTV, and it will be the last.",/review/rw3390772/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2016,mshavzin,1," Its just like an MTV teenage reality show, but with pointy ears.
","The bar here is set so low, I am not sure if its being done by actual actors, or by a high school drama club. The characters talk exactly like bored millennial at a party. They are dressed in outfits from the Renaissance fair, but even the Ren fest has much more of an otherworldly mood . Its about the same thing all teenage films are about. A big squee over which boys and which girls get together, and if two heterosexual guys make a couple, even cuter. There is no story, or rather it is so dumbed down, that you have to wonder what kind of idiots they were expecting for an audience. There is no feel of adventure. No sense of any kind of danger. Its kind of like ""OMG, that one tree is like totally dying. We should probably do something? OK?"" ""LULZ, I don't really care about the tree, but I want to show all the elf guys that I am elfeminist, so i'm like going to compete in that one tree saving thing, OK?""""YEAH? Do it, girl!"".a real disappointment. No one over the age of sixteen can watch this, or should even try. I was actually hoping that MTV had grown up just a bit.",/review/rw3390772/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2016,pesiweinberg,3," Pretty much exactly what you would expect from MTV
","The show is pretty much your classic MTV show, piled on top of Terry Brooks' novels. Female empowerment angle? Check. Lazy exposition where a character says things for no reason other than to inform the audience? Check. Teenagers being super moody, irrational, all while doing cool things? Check. It's far from the worst thing I have ever watched, but also far from what could have been done with these novels. The show is largely targeted at the young teen crowd, and you can see elements of twilight all over it.",/review/rw3390772/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2016,jordanpthaler,9," Pleasantly surprised, rarely disappointed!
","As someone who has read almost every book in the Shannara series multiple times, I can understand why there is such an uproar about this show being picked up by MTV. However, after last night's two hour premiere I found myself very excited about this series. Now for a quick breakdown of what I liked and disliked:",/review/rw3390772/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2016,Aries_cz,7," As someone who didn't read the books, it is pretty good
","I have not read the source books (never even knew they exist), so I do not have any reference to how much the TV version deviates from it. But I found the world presentation pretty good, all the overgrown technology etc. I would welcome a bit more of the other races (Gnomes/Dwarves), but it might be too soon for that.",/review/rw3390772/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2016,heacock,1," What a waste of a good book.
","The dialogue is downright awful. Elves which should embody some foreign qualities talk like teenagers. The whole TV series is just another show cheaply produced for teens. Instead of making a TV show that could be comparable to Game of Thrones, if done right, they produced absolute trash. The show has few redeeming qualities. I am disappointed Terry Brooks would sell the rights to such trash. The characters are weak because they are something you would find on a show like Twilight. The changes to the story from the book detract from the show instead of adding to it.",/review/rw3390772/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2016,c-kelsall,3," Massive missed opportunity
","Where to start? I am a huge fan of fantasy and sci-fi films and literature (and I don't mean only books which are considered by literary snobs to be 'literature'), and for many years I've been hoping there would be a top-quality film or TV production of FANTASY source material to rival The Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones, the latter of which is an excellent example of how good fantasy on screen could be. So imagine my delight (and trepidation) when I heard that the classic fantasy series by Terry Brooks was going to be made into a TV series. Unfortunately, it's a gigantic let-down. I did give it a 3, rather than a 1, and this is why: some of the acting isn't too bad (they're working with dreadful scripts), the CGI isn't horrible,and it's fantasy, of which there is precious little. The reasons why it's terrible are many: bad script (what is it with the modern angsty teen nonsense? - they might as well be Californian), some poor actors, dreadful outfits, and one of the most heinous abuses of the source material I have yet to witness. Have these people actually read The Elfstones of Shannara (the nearest thing to a Terry Brooks book upon which this travesty appears to be based)? The world of 'science' is ancient history in the books, so long ago that the races of the Four Lands have thousands of years of history of their own since the Wars took place. There is effectively no relationship between the ancient past and the magical setting of the Shannara books. Personally, I think it was a misjudgment on the part of Terry Brooks to infer any connection with our world in his books in the first place, but I don't blame him for the ludicrous post-apocalyptic cliché that has ensued on-screen. Is it a fantasy, or a post-modern sci-fi piece? I can't be sure.I'm not sure who this is for: if you want The 100, why not just watch that? You'll probably have a better time if you do. So far, I've persisted with the weekly installments, but I don't really know why.",/review/rw3390772/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2016,puffyone,1," Pretty Horrible
","They changed the story regarding the locales of the main characters. This was obviously to save money because it would have required gnomes and dwarfs. They added trolls for no reason; which wasn't expensive, because, in the creator's view, they are just people wearing gas masks. They appeared to have gotten rid of the Reaper, one of the most important characters in the entire story. That's probably to reduce cost on CGI. They changed Paranor into a ruin instead of a naturally guarded keep, and changed the demonic attack on it to a hallucination of a duel. Again, penny pinching. They immediately introduced Rovers and have them steal the Elfstones, when they have nothing to do with the story until 2/3 through the book. This is probably to remove minor actors and death scenes-- saving money. The only story change they arguably did to make it easier for non-readers to understand the story was change Wil from a 3/4 man into a halfling. ",/review/rw3390772/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2016,Antagonisten,4," Skip this one
","This seems like a series riding on the success of Game of Thrones. A little science fiction, a little fantasy, sword-fighting and demons. That doesn't have to be a bad thing, I like fantasy novels and there have been very few fantasy series worth mentioning, while science- fiction has had it's fair share of good series.",/review/rw3390772/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2016,gielvdsteenhoven,1," Cinematic torture (haven't read the books)
","Normally, I would tell anyone to disregard reviews from people who read the books of a series or film and are disappointed by how it is brought to life. There are many of them for this series as well. I, however, haven't read the books, and am here to warn you to never ever watch this. It's absolute cinematic torture. A semi-serious storyline in an MTV/Twilight setting.",/review/rw3390772/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2016,micah-62,10," Ignore the Low Reviews if you're trying to decide to watch this
","I've read the Terry Brooks books for over 25 years. I've read all of them and I love them. Is this show a faithful adaptation to the letter of those books? No. Is the show terrible? Absolutely not. Any review that says it's low-budget with sub-par effects is trolling. Pure and simple. The show has effects equal to any on network or premium television and is in the same league as some big budget movies. It has the spirit of the Shannara books and I found it fun, entertaining and exciting. The first couple of episodes were a bit rushed making story transitions that were likely days seem like mere moments but that is a minor issue. My rating system is simple if I was entertained and want to see more then it at least gets a 7. I can watch it with my teenagers then it gets an 8. If I liked it enough to write a review - 10. I hope MTV keeps sex out of it (there's some near-nudity in the first 2 episodes that could have been skipped). It's not necessary and Brooks' books simply don't have it. I like the cast, the acting is actually decent (despite the ridiculous troll reviews) and in some instances good. If you like high fantasy, you will probably enjoy this. If you hate seeing young people portraying young people, or don't like fantasy then stay away.",/review/rw3390772/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2016,maggie9991000,1," Just when you thought it couldn't be any cheesier...
","Just watch anything else. Trust me. I LOVE fantasy. I LOVE sci-fi. This is neither. The costumes, the story-line, the 5000 year old TRUCKS that still has tires? The make-up, the stiff acting. Did I mention the story-line? Because there really isn't one. The thinnest gruel of a series EVER. Oliver Twist would have died of starvation on the first page had he been served something so vehemently thin and totally bland. Just don't. I wish I could have done something else with my life instead of watching those first 3 episodes. In the vain hope it would ""pick up"". It didn't.

","I'm extremely picky when it comes to watching shows. I have to care. I'm glad to admit that I care! It's not perfect, it has it's downfalls, but this show is very special. There are reasons why it's not a perfect 10, and I'll eloborate about it below. I'll also address some of the criticism this show gets here. ",/review/rw3390772/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2016,Tweetienator,4," Sorry, but no new GoT or LotR
","Well, well - its MTV ;) In short, this is a series like many others composed for a younger audience (first show with the same ""mixture"" comes to my mind is The 100): Young beautiful actors + lots of teenage drama and ""love"": one dude dies, the next waits already around the corner, oh weak heart of the young ;) + the occasional disturbance imposed by a bad guy. I didn't read the books so I can't compare the show with them, so lets just say that the storyline of the adaption is (I watched the first 4 ep) shallow and repetitive. Another VERY annoying part of the show is the music-score - at least music was anno domini sth MTV was known for... My ears were bleeding after watching - almost every second u got some music competing with the dialogue/doings of the actors. The endless stream of music is really annoying to me on one hand, on the other the score itself is, lets be tender, improvable. One the plus: imo well done are the settings, the cgi-works (some fine landscapes, the look of the demons etc.), and most of the actors are doing their job okayish to well.
