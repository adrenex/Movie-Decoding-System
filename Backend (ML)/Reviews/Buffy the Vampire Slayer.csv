17 March 2004,vertigo_14,8," Who's the Great Bambino?
","The Sandlot is one of the greatest kids movies ever. It is a refreshing break from the family movies of today that mostly concentrate on stories in that upperclass Reiner-esque suburbanite setting of husband and wife and two and a half obnoxious kids. Instead, The Sandlot falls into a line of memorable adventures like 'House Arrest' and 'The Wizard.'",/review/rw0327970/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2001,MichaelM24,," very enjoyable
","Okay, I didn't grow up in the time this film is set (I was born in 1978). But after seeing the film, I've got a pretty good idea of what it was like. My dad likes the film because of how much it reminds him of his own childhood. The story is simple: a new kid moves with his mother and step-father to a brand new neighborhood where he knows no one. So imagine his surprise when he winds up meeting a kid who invites him to play baseball with him and his best friends. Naturally, the other kids don't take to him too well: he's not very good at baseball, and he can't even throw right. But eventually, the kids grow to like him and teach him the ways of the game, and before long they're having a lot of fun during the summer. THE SANDLOT is a great kids film, very family-friendly, unlike the majority of so-called ""family"" films that are made nowadays. Sure, there's a scene where the kids are throwing up on a carnival ride thanks to some chewing tobacco, but the scene is done more for laughs than as a gross-out. (You can imagine that the scene would be done the opposite way if the film was made more recently). The characters and the young kids playing them are all appealing, and it's nice to see Denis Leary playing a kind sensitive role instead of the over-the-top characters he's used to playing. He's very good, even though the part's not a big one. The few scenes between him and star Tom Guiry are very nice. THE SANDLOT is a very good film. Kids will like the humor, and adults will remember how fun it was to be a kid.",/review/rw0327970/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2000,Quinoa1984,8," One of the greatest childhood films ever
","The Sandlot is a great childhood film because it examines changes and friendship among a group of pre-teens.  It is really just good old fashioned fun (especially James Earl Jones' cameo) in the adventures of their baseball days.  Denis leary makes one of his breakthrough films here.  Entertainment supreme, and maybe adults will like it too. A",/review/rw0327970/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2006,planktonrules,8," wonderful family film that will also entertain the parents
","This is a truly amazing film. It's a very good family film that can be enjoyed by BOTH your kids and yourself! That's rare, as often ""family films"" have too much smutty language or sexual situations for kids OR are so saccharine sweet that sane adults would prefer suicide over watching the films (think Disney in the 1960s).",/review/rw0327970/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 1999,Peach-2,8," Capturing time on film.
",I thought The Sandlot captured the innocence and joy of being young and playing baseball in a small town neighborhood. The film isn't perfect but has great atmosphere. I enjoyed the sub-plot with the dog and James Earl Jones and I loved the scenes when the kids were just being kids and enjoying the summer. The film made me feel good and I sometimes think that's all a film is supposed to do. Check it out.,/review/rw0327970/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2004,departed07,10," an all time classic movie.
","I grew up watching The Sandlot and what i realized about this movie is that this film doesn't have the players winning or losing, but this is about friendship and how a big dog can make your worst dreams come true. The Sandlot is about a gawky kid named Smalls(Tom Guiry) who just moves into the neighborhood and tries to blend in with the crowd, until he fails. Mike Vitar who plays the neighborhood baseball hero Benny, helps Smalls play baseball and fit him in with the crowd. The team accepts Smalls and what makes the film interesting like i written above is that this film isn't about winning or losing, but about living your days in the summer when you are ten to twelve and realize that there is more to life than winning.",/review/rw0327970/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 1999,Adriane,," How can you not love this movie?
","One of the best ""kid"" movies that I have ever seen. A story about friendship and baseball, and the people in our lives. Great one to watch with your friends to reminisce about the old days. Look for a great cameo by James Earl Jones. Recommended for those of us who had great friends growing up, and never wanted the good times to end.",/review/rw0327970/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2007,hu675,8," Likable family film with plenty of amusing moments and the young cast are appealing.

1 October 2013,SnoopyStyle,8," Not just a kids movie. It's a great movie.
","Scotty Smalls is the new kid in the idyllic small town with his mom and stepdad. He's an awkward kid who wants to play baseball with neighborhood kids. There were 8 of them, and he hoped to be the ninth. Their best player Benny Rodriquez takes Smalls under his wing. Over the summer, the group has great childhood adventures together. It all culminates to a story of a lost baseball signed by Babe Ruth and a feared dog named the Beast.",/review/rw0327970/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2004,sublime501,8," Very enjoyable feel-good movie.
","THE SANDLOT is quite possibly one of the best ""family films"" ever made. In it, a young, studious, unpopular boy named Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry) moves to a suburb just before school lets out for the summer, and concurrently has a hard time making friends. He frequently sees kids playing baseball in a sandlot in his neighborhood, and wants to make friends with them. He figures the best way to do this is to join in on their baseball games--but alas, Scotty has almost no baseball skills, while the other kids are very experienced and good at the game. One day, the neighborhood hero Benny (Mike Vitar) approaches Scotty and asks if he'd like some pointers and to join in on their game. Scotty agrees, and slowly improves, while making friends with the other boys in the neighborhood.",/review/rw0327970/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2016,Hitchcoc,9," Beautifully Constructed Movie About Childhood
","I remember that for most of my childhood, all the way to graduation, I played baseball. I was never a varsity player, but my friends and I spent our whole summers doing pickup games. This movie captures a time that doesn't exist any more. Adults have organized so much of the fun out of sports that kids don't get to just play for fun any more. League. League. League. Here we have a ragtag bunch of kids who are all over the place talent- wise. One is fantastic. The rest just love the game. But there is more than the game. There is a mysterious place where balls disappear and a dog the size of a walrus holds forth. There are stories and bragging and all kinds of kid things. There's James Earl Jones, who is feared by the kids through most of the movie until..... See this. It will delight you.",/review/rw0327970/?ref_=tt_urv

But you do what you can, which means learning the game.

","""The Sandlot"" has to be one of, if not the best kids movie ever made. Because this is one of the very few movies that is equally entertaining whether your a kid or an adult.

","I rate my films in terms of context. This film never aspired to be an Oscar nominated movie of a lifetime. But it did aspire to be a good family film, and that it is. For me, I'll admit nostalgia has a lot to do with it. This is a movie from my childhood, and yes as a girl I had a huge crush on Mike Vitar. But at the same time this reminds me of my childhood because my brother played baseball with all the neighborhood kids in our side yard and we always spent our summers outside or at the neighborhood pool just as the kids in the movie did.",/review/rw0327970/?ref_=tt_urv

","The main character's name was not Steve... if you have seen this movie more than once, or for more than 30 minutes, you'd realize the protagonist's name was Scotty Smalls. This movie is indeed a classic, a timeless piece accessible by all. If you love or have ever had a deep passion for baseball, this movie will move you like no other film has ever moved you before. I like to have a few too many beers and watch it through myself... the ending scene where the narrator (Scotty Smalls) tells the stories of how everyone eventually left the sandlot, and town for that matter, brings me to tears. One of the greatest movies of our era and a sure classic for not only us, but our kids as well.",/review/rw0327970/?ref_=tt_urv

18 April 2013,zardoz-13,10," Diamond in the Rough
","Watching ""The Sand lot"" is a lot of fun. The new kid in the block who doesn't know squat about baseball learns a lot about the game during its 101 minute running time. This tale of initiation resembles an Arthurian myth about a knight slaying a dragon. Our pint-sized knights are playing baseball when the protagonist accidentally loses his stepfather vintage Babe Ruth autographed baseball. The child actors are a likable lot and director David M. Evans orchestrate the action with enough flair to make these suburban shenanigans memorable. The first half of ""The Sandlot"" acquaints us with the adolescent adventurers as they accept the outsider and mold themselves into a single unit. Once our hero swats his first four-bagger, he becomes friends with his compatriots. The moment that he achieves this zenith of sorts, he creates the chaos that truly solidifies their group. All along Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry of ""Ride with the Devil"") has said that he knows who 'the Great Bambino' is, but he doesn't. One day after his best friend, Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez (Mike Vitar of ""Sunset Grill""), hits a home run, the guys are left without a baseball. Nobody has enough cents to buy one. Nevertheless, Scott wants to cement his friendship with the group and contribute something. He takes the prized baseball with Babe Ruth's John Hancock on the cowhide and offers it to the guys. Of course, they don't know that the ball Scotty has supplied is a trophy ball. Scotty attain his moment in the sun with his home run. Now, the kids have to figure out how to retrieve the baseball. Hatched a nerd, Scotty concocts several nerdy contraptions to enable them to recover the ball from the backyard where a monstrous watch dog with a reputation lives. Through the action, Evans appropriates every opportunity to build up the dog until it becomes the equivalent of a dragon. Eventually, Benny ventures over the fence in his brand new P.F. Flyer sneakers, retrieves the ball, but the Beast (an English Mastiff) pursues him relentlessly through backyards, a movie theater, a Founder Day Fair, and the swimming pool. The dog turns out to be more than a beast that ate a child. James Earl Jones plays the owner of Hercules. Like I said, ""The Sandlot"" is a whole lot of fun.",/review/rw0327970/?ref_=tt_urv

","As far as fun kids films go, this is one of the best in my opinion. I enjoyed the characters even if they were campy and behaving in cliche movie ways. Everything about the beast and James Earl Jones role I loved about this movie. And the movie has an unusual but very sweet ending that brings me close to tears every time. I can't really describe why. Just see The Sandlot already if you haven't, it is a classic 90s kids movie!",/review/rw0327970/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2005,michaelRokeefe,7," Life is baseball and baseball is life.
","Heartwarming and enjoyable family movie about a young boy(Tom Guidry)that moves into a new town and desperately wanting to fit in with the rest of the neighborhood boys. In the summer of 1962, a bat and a ball is like life's blood. The sandlot is like a home away from home; a place for a young boy to exercise his fantasy and spend the best hours of summer. A good smack will send the ball sailing over the fence to never be seen again for it lands in Mr. Mertle's(James Earl Jones)backyard, which is guarded by a humongous dog...a super slobbering dog that devours just about anything and everything. The high drama and dilemma of the summer is trying to retrieve a Babe Ruth autographed ball from the territory of the big ass junkyard dog, Goliath. Other cast members of note: Patrick Renna, Mike Vitar, Chauncey Leopardi, Denis Leary and Karen Allen. THE SANDLOT is nostalgic, sentimental and stuffed full of innocence and humor. Worth watching again...and again.",/review/rw0327970/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2002,Theoriginaltruebrit,," I love this movie and for one particular reason.
","My husband watched it for the first time a few days ago (over the long Veterans Day weekend).  He then watched it for a second time the day after. He did not have a happy childhood, in fact some childhood memories for him are downright painful.  We have been married 11 years and I know very little about his childhood and what went on.  However, after (and during the second viewing), he began a waterfall of childhood memories that I had never heard before.  Of long summers of ""sandlot"" games with him and his cousins (they were known as ""the cousins"") they could play baseball and football and kicked the butt of most of the teams in town, during the movie his memories spewed forth as if they had been bottled up and just needed to be set free. His friend actually did the ""lifeguard"" thing, pretended to drown to kiss her, and like the movie they were all banned from the pool.  They also had a ""scary guy"" in the old house that everyone was terrified of (in fact so did I as I recall).  He assures me that this movie is as faithful a retelling of a childhood in the 60s as he has ever seen, and he revels in it.  I think that is the greatest compliment that anyone can ever pay a movie and I am grateful to the director for uncorking the well of my husbands memories for me to share.",/review/rw0327970/?ref_=tt_urv
