14 February 2006,mjw2305,6," The beginning of the end
","Batman forever fails to follow in the footsteps of the first 2 movies, after Tim Burton and Michael Keaton were replaced with with Joel Schumacher and Val Kilmer. Schumachers approach is too comical and Gotham has lost the sinister ora that Burton created, Val Kilmer is OK as the bat, and he certainly helps save the film from total disaster.",/review/rw1765705/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2021,bass-player-blues,7," Unfairly criticized but becoming a classic
","Batman Forever may be the most unfairly criticzed super-hero film ever made. It's sandwiched between the fandom of the Burton and Nolan films while simultaneously blamed for leading to Batman and Robin. If you compare it to the darker and more gothic Burton films and are disappointed Keaton isn't still playing Batman, of course you're not gonna enjoy it. If you compare it to the more serious neo-realism of the Nolan films, again you're not gonna enjoy it. What is it you ask? Batman Forever essentially plays out like a live action cartoon and it does this very well. If you watch it through that lens instead of judging it for what it's not you'll find that Batman Forever actually has superior continuity and pacing than any other Batman film except maybe the 1966 version. This is coming from someone who's favorite film is Batman 1989 and a big Tim Burton fan. It honestly baffles me to hear people rave about how great Batman Returns is and then go on to bash Batman Forever. While Returns has a ton going for it, it really suffers from the same core problem as Batman and Robin; the director getting too cute with creative control. All Joel Schumacher did was set out to make a fun super-hero film with something for everyone to enjoy and I honestly think he succeeded with Forever. With Batman and Robin he went too flamboyant just like Burton went too zany and weird with Returns. The first time around both directors got it right testing the waters with their own respective styles. Everything in the film is very cartoonish and if you appreciate it from that perspective it's really quite masterful in a lot of subtle and not so subtle ways. Although Batman The Animated Series was largely influenced by the Burton movies Forever really seems like it's bringing that onto the big screen with real actors and real sets which is quite a feat. Schumacher just added more color and neon which honestly is a welcome change from the stark art deco gothic flavor present in Returns. Nothing wrong with that flavor in Returns, it's just that Burton went all in and we didn't necessarily need more of the same. Batman Returns actually has considerably different art direction from Batman 1989 yet you rarely hear fans complain about that difference or even acknowledge it.",/review/rw1765705/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2002,Smells_Like_Cheese,8," Not as good as Batman and Batman Returns, but it's still a good movie
","Personally, I just enjoyed the first Batman the best, I think a lot of us did. But that doesn't mean this was a bad installment to the ""Batman"" series, it's actually very decent worth more than one look. We do have a new but every exceptional Batman, Val Kilmer, who has a tough role to fit into after the great performances Michael Keaton brought. Nicole Kidman plays Chase, a beautiful and intelligent scientist who has the hots for Batman more than Bruce, she does a great job and looks so sexy! Jim Carrey, the master of comedy, takes the role of The Riddler, only he can bring the true comic relief and was a great choice. Tommy Lee Jones, as Two Face, was also great and so believable as a scary villain. Last but not least, Chris O'donnel as the wimsical, but more serious than anything version of Robin. The dynamic duo are finally put together for this masterpiece of a sequel! ",/review/rw1765705/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2005,lee_eisenberg,5," Jim Carrey stole the show
","Some people talk about ""the stick of straw that broke the camel's back"", meaning when something reached the tipping point. So when did the Batman franchise go bad? Well, ""Batman Forever"" was getting silly, but it still had Jim Carrey to steal the show as The Riddler (""Batman and Robin"" had about as many good qualities as a barrel of toxic waste). Personally, I don't know why they had to have Batman (Val Kilmer) going through therapy; remove that and he still would have been a cool superhero with neat gadgets. Tommy Lee Jones wasn't bad as Two-Face. Nicole Kidman and Chris O'Donnell, as Dr. Chase Meridian and Robin, respectively, didn't really add anything.",/review/rw1765705/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,7," Fast and funny, if rather hit and miss
","I thoroughly enjoyed the first two Batman movies, and although Tim Burton didn't return and replaced by Joel Schummacher I decided to give Batman Forever a chance. The film isn't as good or as dark as the first two films, but it is a huge improvement over Batman and Robin, the less said about that film the better. Anyway, this film is quite possibly the fastest and the funniest of the series, but despite all this there are some hit and miss elements. Chris O'Donnell is annoying and lifeless as Robin, the script has its weak spots despite some terrific lines from Jim Carrey and while Nicole Kidman was bearable, her character could have been written better. However, it is stylishly filmed with Oscar-nominated photography and excellent special effects, the direction is surprisingly more efficient and the action hurls along at an exciting and breakneck pace. The acting is good on the most part with Val Kilmer brooding as Batman and Michael Gough perfect as Alfred. The villains steal the show though, while Tommy Lee Jones is excellent as usual as Two Face Jim Carrey is the one with the best lines and delivery as the Riddler. Overall, hit and miss but a decent entry in the Batman franchise. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw1765705/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2005,jboothmillard,9," Batman Forever
","A totally new Batman and a totally new director, Joel Schumacher. Dropping Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer has now entered Batman's boots. The main difference of this Batman to Tim Burton's is he is not as dark as before. This time the caped crusader is up against the perfect villain duo of Tommy Lee Jones as the dangerous Harvey Two-Face, and with him is the hilarious but also nasty likes of Jim Carrey as the Riddler. There is also the appearance of Nicole Kidman, and later Chris O'Donnell becomes Batman's remembered sidekick the boy wonder Robin. Jim Carrey is more funny than the Jack Nicholson was, but this film is still not as great as the first one. Also starring Drew Barrymore as Sugar, Pat Hingle as Comissioner Gordon and Michael Gough as Alfred. A good array of action and adventure is in store. It was nominated the Oscars Best Cinematography, Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Song for ""Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me"", also featuring Seal's ""Kiss From a Rose"". Batman was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Jim Carrey was number 47, and Nicole Kidman number 21 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",/review/rw1765705/?ref_=tt_urv

","Okay look, Tommy Lee Jones as 2 face was probably a miscast. Sure there are some scenes that are... Well, unnecessary. Do I feel the Jim Carey should have played the Joker instead of riddler?

15 November 2005,Derek237,7," And now for something completely different
","I loved the first two Batman movies, and honestly would have loved to see Burton go on to direct more entries in the series, but Joel Shumacher's Batman Forever is not at all an unwelcome change. I think some people recollect this film and automatically associate it with Shumacher's awful second Batman attempt, Batman & Robin. That is the bad movie. This is not. People also seem to forget how big of a hit it was. Artistically, there were things it got wrong and didn't do as well as the others, but there were things it did so much better, too. For one thing, this is the only 'Batman' with a decent soundtrack to its name (including 2 great songs by U2 and Seal).",/review/rw1765705/?ref_=tt_urv

23 March 2014,classicsoncall,7," ""Let's see what justice has in store for you.""
","Among the four pre-Dark Knight films of Christopher Nolan, I'd say that this one was the most suitable for my tastes. Note I didn't say 'favorite', because in general, these films are on a seriously lower grade level than the Dark Knight pictures. I guess for me, this story at least had some character development missing in the prior two pictures, as in the exploration of Bruce Wayne/Batman's (Val Kilmer) duality and the story of Robin's (Chris O'Donnell) origin. Batman's conflict was given added weight with the presence of Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman), a psychologist who found herself in a similar conflict over which one to choose as a romantic interest. There was an interesting scene where Wayne walked right into an unset trap by seeing a bat in a Rorschach drawing. That was a revelation for both Bruce and the shrink.",/review/rw1765705/?ref_=tt_urv

","Batman Forever is easily one of the more enjoyable superhero movies ever produced in my opinion. It has a perfect balance of comedy, drama, action and adventure, and romance to satisfy pretty much any film enthusiasts. Even though this film had its quirks, especially from a Batman fan's point of view, this Bat-Film is just overall too much fun to let those itty bitty problems bother you.",/review/rw1765705/?ref_=tt_urv

4 October 2002,Angry_Arguer,," Fun, that's the whole point
","Batman Forever lacks the outright depressing, darkened mood of the first two.  Good!  After Batman Returns I didn't know how much more decadent they could get, with so much lack of lighting I was having a hard time just WATCHING the movies. As far as Batman himself I am happy to say that Val Kilmer is NOT Michael Keaton or Adam West.  They were ok for the job but were just too wooden and monolithic for their actions.  With Kilmer we get a much more fluid Batman who doesn't seem to lag around like Keaton's did.  Speed is what he does best...and he does it! The supporting protagonists do the meager, ok job they need to keep this film acceptable.  It is nice to see Dick Grayson ditch that sickeningly awful ""Robin"" outfit a la 1966 and get a REAL superhero suit. THE VILLAINS! No Batman movie would be complete without them!  Tommy Lee Jones is ok as Two-Face and his presence holds on until Jim Carrey--master of dancing around and acting like the modern, much cooler Jerry Lewis--slides in as the Riddler.  Like Nicholson in the first, Carrey holds our attention with his shenanigans (even if they annoy us) and make the movie a bit more fun. That's the whole point.  When we go to a Batman movie, we aren't expecting ""The Godfather"" or ""Citizen Kane"".  We want to be entertained to the MAX and this movie does just that with a hint of glitz and a lot more style than Batman 2 did.  Remember how it took over half an hour for us to get around to observing Keaton as Bruce Wayne in that one?  I think these two are tied for second. By all means avoid Batman & Robin!  You will be utterly disappointed with George ""ER"" Clooney, Arnold ""Jingle all the Way"" Scwarzenegger, Uma ""the Avengers"" Thurman, and everything else in that piece of garbage.",/review/rw1765705/?ref_=tt_urv

","More than ten years, and this probably still hurts like a chemical burn, in the hearts and minds of fans of the dark knight. Perhaps they had just gotten over the 60's series, too... and that one at least had the excuse that Batman hadn't really been done before that point. This follows a good film, and one that came close to being that, and, well, from the first lines, you can tell that this can by no means be considered as proper an approach as either of those. This film answered a once big question; would you rather never see your hero, your idol, in a film, or only see him or her done right? Burton got out of the director's chair when he found that his dark, and far more fitting, style of doing these films was not what the studio intended for future entries, and, presumably because he's cheap and easy to rely on for the producers, not making a fuss, Joel Schumacher was brought in. Everything proceeds to disintegrate. The bleak Gotham gains bright, tawdry neon, oh how the production team who created the architecture of the city in the first two must feel. The characterization is turned into superficial moments and lines of dialog. It's clear that Schumacher neither understands nor respects the medium of comic books; S1m0ne, by Andrew Niccol, goes too far in trying to make us laugh at celebrities and those at home who love them, but at least his production does hold truth and satire. We fans, we read comic books, is what we need really more people telling us how stupid they think that is? The presentation of the villains further illustrates it. Two-Face is essentially the Joker, just with only half a face of make-up. Where Nicholson was haunting and grotesque, Lee, in spite of being a very talented actor who I like and respect, and enjoy the work of, merely comes off as a nuisance, not a real threat. A cartoon. The utter lack of respect for the source material is seen in one brief part, mentioned in the Trivia section, where the character does something that not only is inconsistent, but downright goes straight against the very *core* of the personality of him! The Riddler is possibly even worse. I like Carrey, too... he's the very reason I initially watched it. Heck, these actors are almost all talented, only you wouldn't know it from watching this. The acting is overdone. Heck, everything is! Sequences are pushed to the extremes, with far too many colors and too much going on at once. The once well-written dialog is replaced with pitiful one-liners and such. Robin is introduced to this series of Batman, and he's made hip. See the earring? And just look at him hanging up the laundry! What were they *thinking*? The nipples on the suits even bothered Bob Kane himself. The action isn't even particularly exciting. It's such a shame that this actually had potential; there's back-story, motivation and explanation behind the title character, and the original plot(described elsewhere, it might spoil stuff in the film to reveal it here) sounds interesting. The worst may be that on the surface, this doesn't look anywhere near as awful as it is... it is a technically speaking fairly well-done film. Camera, editing and sound are by no means inspiring, but we *are* talking about Schumacher, here. They get the job done, he gets the job done, that's why the producers like him, that's why he keeps getting work. The effects vary, but many are good. There are a few references that aren't bad. I recommend this only to those who aren't fans. I don't know that I would have made it all the way through this and it's even worse follow-up had I been. As for who will enjoy it... that is a good question. If you're looking for parody, Black Scorpion is really better. 5/10",/review/rw1765705/?ref_=tt_urv
