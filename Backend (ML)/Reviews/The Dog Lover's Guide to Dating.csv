30 September 2018,michellelcalvert,6," Read the book if you are confused.
","I read the book a few months ago and then discovered the movie on Netflix. The movie does follow the book fairly well, but the book just seems to explain things better and provide better background details so you don't feel so confused. I realized the ending of the movie skipped over a lot of details.",/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2018,gbortoli,4," Boring and baffling
","Let me start by saying that this movie is not completely garbage. It has something to it that keeps you going. For some reason, despite an unintelligible plot and amazingly slow pace, you still find yourself watching the movie waiting for it to redeem itself. It doesn't. The more time you invest in this adventure, the more painful it becomes to admit that this movie is beyond redemption, that nothing normal is going to happen and that you wasted two hours of your life.",/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2018,Aaron1375,6," Did I miss something?
","I see this movie is a bit polarizing here on IMDB as some people describe it as a masterpiece and it is only us stupid Americans that do not understand its brilliance while others hate it saying it is a pointless movie with virtually no plot. Where do I fall in? I say it was an interesting movie that does fall apart due to the fact it literally had a non-ending. Seriously, us Americans may not be as smart as you Europeans, but this film literally had no ending, any idiot could see that. Oh, and by the way, movies here in America are made with explosives and all that stuff and pretty much dumbed down for European and other foreign lands so take that for what it is worth. I enjoyed aspects of this film very much and I thought it was racing towards some thrilling conclusion, but it seems to me someone did not know how they wanted this thing to end. Either the director did not like the original ending in the book, or the book had a really anticlimactic end to it and the director didn't want to change it (yes, this film is based on a book).",/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2018,Condemned-Soul,6," 'Hold the Dark' holds all the right pieces, but drifts away into incoherent ambiguity
","Anyone who caught a glimpse of the trailer would be certain a genre-meshing treat was on the cards, but 'Hold the Dark' fails to fulfil on that eerie expectation by the time the anti-climactic ending happens.",/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2020,gailruff,3," The best part was the ending.
","Now they're saying we should've read the book first. That really ticks me off. A good screenplay should be able to stand on its own, even if from another source. The best part of this movie was the ending, as it ended my suffering. Almost everything in this story, from beginning to end, made no sense at all. And it crawled like a sick slug.",/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2018,CinemaClown,," Jeremy Saulnier's Latest Is Also His Weakest
","After establishing himself as one of the most promising talents working in the film industry today with two back-to-back cinematic gems, Jeremy Saulnier hits a snag with his fourth feature film and delivers his first dud with Hold the Dark.",/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2018,Come-and-Review,6," An atmospheric success that is far from perfect
","I can't clearly determine what ""Hold the dark"" is: a sophisticated film that seems mindless or a mindless thriller that seems sophisticated. Nonetheless, it's an enjoyable view.",/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2018,jribeiro739,8," Read the book after. Then watch again. Ending explained.
",After watching Hold The Dark I felt compelled to read the novel by William Giraldi. After my first time watching the movie I was really left with many questions that needed answering. The movie was well shot and every scene seemed to keep me wondering how the movie would come to an end. After reading the novel I then understood the movie in its entirety. Here is the movie explained.,/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2018,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,7," Holds your patience in the Dark
",The basic premise of Jeremy Saulnier's adaptation of Hold the Dark takes place in Alaska where wolf expert Russell Core has arrived to investigate the disappearance of a child claimed by his mother to have been taken from the very animal Core studies. From there Core discovers that the wolves may be the least of his concern. ,/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2020,Calicodreamin,2," Wtf did I just watch?!
","This movie makes absolutely no sense, sparse dialogue, confusing storyline, and weird people. Indescribably weird and nonsensical. People die left and right, wolves are somehow involved, and it just randomly ends. Avoid this movie!! It gets 2 stars because good dark vibes from the cinematography.",/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2018,Technomage001,3," Please re-edit this movie.
","All the parts are there, good acting, engaging characters, great nature scenes, and a great story that ended up being a little too cryptic. The movie held my attention because I didn't want to miss anything that would confirm what I thought the film would be about. But it never did. My suspicions is that the answers were left on the cutting room floor when the film was edited. ",/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2018,Leofwine_draca,8," Challenging
","The third recent picture from director Jeremy Saulnier, following on from his BLUE RUIN and GREEN ROOM (two films I thought were excellent), HOLD THE DARK is a tougher, more challenging picture that takes more effort from the viewer going in. This is no longer a simple, pared-down revenge thriller like his previous pictures, but something more subtle and less clearly-defined. The excellent Jeffrey Wright plays a wolf expert who arrives in a small Alaskan town to investigate a child taken by a wolf pack. He soon discovers that he's in a place populated by some very disturbed individuals indeed. Saulnier's film is a slow burner that commands close attention and is very satisfying despite providing no easy answers. As ever, long stretches are broken by sudden, shocking twists and bursts of violence that'll have you wincing. There's at least one jaw-dropping set-piece and some great acting from the likes of James Badge Dale and Alexander Skarsgard. The ending fizzles very slightly, but overall HOLD THE DARK is a fresh, engaging picture that reminded me of the similarly dark Korean picture THE WAILING.",/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2019,trashgang,9," great atmosphere
","Available on Netflix, my father-in-law told me to go watch this one. He assured me it was great but a flick not for everybody. After seeing it I must agree.",/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2019,tin-B,5," SPEAK UP PLEASE
","Would have been better if the child's mother knew how to speak up. She lit4erally WHISPERS every line, even when they are OUTSIDE CRUNCHING IN THE SNOW her lines are still delivered in a QUIET SOFT WHISPER. I looked her up and she has been in enough shows for SOMEONE to have EFFING told her to SPEAK UP. She is one of many actresses who speaks in a monotone deadpan whisper because they idiotically think it is sexy. It practically made me shut thisw movie OFF. I can't stand women like that.",/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2018,ClaviculaNox,9," Beautifully Captivating
","There are so much negative reviews but it's really beautiful. Most of the reviews written is because they didn't understand the plot of the movie or what it represents.
It's a deeply dark movie on so many levels. 
It's a story inside a story, the mother killed her son because she was living in the dark. As her husband is her brother. Incist. 
And there are many implications and hints across the movie that shows that ""indirectly.""
The scene when he was looking for his wife in the hotel, the woman said ""you both have the same eyes and same hair""
The Indian hunter said ""your father said you are unnatural.""
The pictures inside the drawe, the second picture shows a bow and a girl sitting as a family by lake. 
The wolf mask, they both had it. ",/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2018,Platypuschow,4," Hold the Dark: I get the criticism, to an extent anyway
","Hold the Dark is a bone of contention for Netflix users, the community seems thoroughly torn and I found myself pushing it up my watchlist because it was recommended to me.",/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2018,axekicker78,1," Yet another stinker from Netflix
","The mood looks promising. They you start watching it and it's all downhill from there. Starts with the cryptic, monotone voice over, which is now a cliche to tell you,""Ohh, this is so mysterious and spooky."" Dialogue is terrible, a very bad imitation in terms of pacing of the movie Drive, which was excellent. And it just goes from bad to worse. Skarsgaard is useless. I'm still not convinced this guy belongs in anything but that silly show he was in about vampires. He's one note in everything he does. And you couldn't care less about him or anyone else in this film. And as 90% of all the other reviews state, the plot is unintelligible, slow, and pretentious. Skarsgaard goes around killing people. The end. It keeps you watching because you keep thinking, ""OK, at some point, someone is going to tell me what the hell is going on in this plot. It never happens. I swear, it's like being on a bus trip to Idaho and thinking, at some point, we're going to get there so I can get off this crappy bus."" But you never arrive. How does a script like this get greenlighted? Who reads something like this and says, ""My God, people need to see this! Let's dedicate all this time and manpower to make this non-story?"" I'm dumfounded.",/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2018,saadgkhan,1," One of the worst movies on the name of Artistic Cinema
","It has to be one of the worst movies I have seen recently. mediocre movies are mostly timepass but this one I was kept thinking WTF is hapenning? There are scenes after scenes story changes, new characters comes, die and then it ends without proper answer. 
The whole cast speaks in riddles, slow as if someone is dying. I had to Google after the movie to understand what just happened. Its scenic and Geoferry Wright and Alexander Skarsguard acted well but they can not save this dull movie made on the name of Maloncholia art. Why people can not talk like normal people in movies anymore, Art movies doesn't have to be boring and gore just for the sack of it. Very disappointed!!!",/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2019,Wuchakk,8," Unpredictable bleak Alaskan adventure, mystery, thriller
",An author and wolf expert (Jeffrey Wright) arrives at a remote village in Alaska to help rid the town of a wolf problem that has resulted in a few dead children. Riley Keough plays the troubled mother and Alexander Skarsgård her taciturn husband coming home from Iraq.

29 September 2018,laserburn,2," 2/10 stars for 2/10 parts of the story you should have given us
","Such a shame. You can see that a movie is technically very well made, camera is top notch, acting is excellent, pacing is slow, but steady. It has a lot of things going for it.",/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2018,bushtony,3," And, so...what was it about...?
","There are certain attractive and intriguing elements at play here. A bleak, isolated, poverty-stricken community beyond the fringes of civilisation, surrounded by snowy mountains, forests and packs of wolves. Missing children and grieving parents. A psychologically damaged naturalist, writer and wolf expert. A dogged local sheriff. A veteran of the Iraq conflict who is a stone-cold killer of men. His wife who appears to have murdered their son and blamed it on the animals. Native American mythology surrounding wolves and spirits and stuff. ",/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2018,michelleecooney,8," Bleak doesn't equate to boring
","This was a fantastic film. The acting was solid, stoic, and appropriate for the subject matter. The cinematography was absolutely stunning; leave it to Saulnier to remind us just how red blood really is against the snow.",/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv

1 June 2020,asage19,10," Beautiful film
","I can't say that I understood the whole thing - it was quite surrealistic. I'm fine with that. It's in a beautiful setting. The characters are intriguing, and well-acted, right from the main characters to the supporting characters. It's mysterious, moody, mythical, spiritual... poetry rather than a comic book story. If you don't mind not having your hand held this is the film for you. Ignore the haters.",/review/rw5790546/?ref_=tt_urv
