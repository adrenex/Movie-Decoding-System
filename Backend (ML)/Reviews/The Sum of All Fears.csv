20 July 2004,supertom-3,," Great comedy!
","My Family is a great comedy. It's rare these days that a sitcom can stand the test of time but this has lasted 4 years all ready ad is still as funny as it was to start with, and it was funny to start with which is also important. It's very exaggerated but very much based in real life and everyone can see trademarks of their own families in the Harpers.",/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2018,ilovemovies2016,9," amazing classic 2000s British comedy

24 October 2012,paul_bedward,10," My Family, great slapstick humor.
","A great British sit com series that has evolved with the aging of its stars. The series is based on traditional British slapstick humor revolving around the relationship of family members and their close friends and work colleague's. Basically great humor that can be watched as repeats and still enjoyed by the wider family group. One thing to note is how some of the cast members, including family members just suddenly disappear. Nick the eldest son is one of the key characters in the early episodes and plays a brilliant character who drives his father Ben quite insane with his poorly thought out schemes. Nick suddenly disappears as the series progress and unfortunately it is a loss that affects the program as a whole.",/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2018,darryl-jason,10," Without A Doubt The Best Sitcom To Ever Grace Our Screens
","I fell in love with this show right from the start. ""My Family"" has definitely got to be one of the funniest & well scripted British sitcoms to ever grace our TV screens. The humour is just incredible & the delivery is spot on! As predictable & quick-witted as it is, this never fails to make me laugh.",/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv

",My Family is the most popular British sitcom of the last decade with millions ignoring the snide remarks and put downs from critics and enjoying the misadventures of the Harper Family.,/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2020,melissaclough-15598,10," My family is hilarious
",There are not many sit coms that can make me laugh to the point im in tears but this is genuinely funny. The son Nick has to be my favorite he drives his father completely up the wall. He is funny he makes the whole show what it is. I love all the characters. I always watch this if im having a bad day and it never fails to cheer me up. I recommend this to anyone who needs a laugh. There is one thing that is sad as the series goes on Nick leaves and it does affect the show but its still good to watch.,/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2001,MEG-40,," Yes. it is surprising!
","Robert Lindsay on our TV screens at present in two roles so vastly different from each other- Captain Pellew of Hornblower fame and as the ""insane"" dentist - father - family man of My Family! I am a great fan of RL ever since first seeing him in Nightingales, another quite insane comedy of quite a different calibre.",/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2003,tim1701,," Sharp British Comedy
","It's not often we brits make a comedy that can travel well, but the universal truths within my family make it travel and will make it timeless to boot, Robert Lyndsy is amazingly dry, and Zoe Wannamaker shines in every episode, the long suffering family head makes us all smile by recognising our everyday problems and life obsticles with great punch and hillarity, US viewers may think this is a flop due to how many episodes there are, but it is far from a flop, UK seasons usually only last 6 episodes, My family is now in its third season with a fourth in production, Not to be missed, i am eagily awaiting the bbc to release this on dvd! well done auntie beeb, more comedys like this please!",/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2002,stamper,," A day in the life of the Harpers
","The Harpers are not what I would call a model family, but I think that they are in a way a realistic family. Of course, the situations are exaggerated, but the basics are very realistic. Just look at Susan's clinging behavior towards college going daughter Janey. Janey thinks her mother is being annoying, while Susan thinks that it is fun if she and her daughter are able to spend some time together. Now not every mom is as goes as far as Susan, but believe me, some parents really know how to break your biscuit. The exaggeration of these and other typical daily events, the great actors and the fact that you see how much the individual family members love to hate each other, make this series a must see. If you enjoy this show, also try Men behaving Badly (UK version) and Fawlty Towers.",/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2013,Vincentiu,," special flavor
","a BBC product. so, spiced humor, precise frame for ordinaries problems, good actors and special situations. result - an adorable series. but this is only a sketch of My family. its charm is result of great attention to details. the humor is like a mirror for each viewer. and Zoe Wanamaker is amazing as wife and mother who build measure in her family. like the performance of Robert Lindsay as head of a strange group who becomes, only accidentally, a real family.it is not an exception - many films presents situations about slices of ordinary society but, in this case, something is different. its flavor who discovers, like old Commedia dell''arte, the errors and conflicts, crisis and solutions of each day in warm light.",/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv

","I absolutely love this series, I own the whole box set! Okay, I admit that the series went a bit downhill after Nick left, but still! I rewatch it over and over. What's there to hate? I love British comedy and this is just so enjoyable to watch.",/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2007,kclambeth,6," not awful
","When my family first started it was fresh, funny and had good story lines. The characters were Ben a dentist, his wife Susan, his eldest son Nick, daughter Janey and son Michael. The interaction with the family members was strong, Nick had us all laughing with his cheeky grin and crazy schemes, Susan was the overprotective mother and Ben hated everybody.",/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2004,StayinFrosty,," Hilarious
","""My Family"" follows the day-to-day foibles of the Harpers, a British family of five. There's Ben (Robert Lindsay), the dentist who seems to loathe his life and family. Susan (Zoë Wanamaker), his tour-guide wife who prides herself on her open mind and is an awful cook but doesn't let it hinder her culinary style. Janey (Daniela Denby-Ashe) is the fashion magazine-reading, self-admittedly shallow teenaged daughter. (In season 4, Janey goes to college and is replaced by the vacuous Abi (Siobhan Hayes), Ben's cousin's daughter, for just as much fun). Michael (Gabriel Thomson) is the youngest son, who seems to be the brightest of the bunch. All of them are funny but the character who really shines, is the oldest son, Nick (Kris Marshall). Every scene with Nick is comic genius; from his quest to make money through various schemes and an assortment of jobs to his seeming inability to be troubled by anything.",/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2003,rjhey,," Laugh a minute
","I can be in the foulest mood, but just watching an episode of ""My Family"" can bring a smile back onto my face. Ben is hilarious, with his angry moods and ""don't give a damn"" attitude, Susan with her awful cooking and power to dominate, Janie with her ever practiced money grabbing techniques, Abbi with her extremely dumb blonde act, Michael with his seriousness and finally Nick with his stupid ideas and quick, quirky one-liners. The funny thing is, I can look at the Harper family and it reminds me completely of my own",/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2009,manchester_england2004,1," Symbolises the decline in the quality of British sitcom production!
","Britain has a long history of sitcom making that dates all the way back to the late 1950s. The heyday of British sitcom production was probably the 1960s and 1970s, with such TV shows as STEPTOE AND SON, DAD'S ARMY, ARE YOU BEING SERVED?, ON THE BUSES, GEORGE AND MILDRED, MAN ABOUT THE HOUSE, RISING DAMP, PORRIDGE and countless others being very popular examples.",/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2004,liammurphy1,," Well worth watching..
","It's a damn sight better than recent BBC Sitcoms we've had to endure over the last few years like, My Hero, The Savages, Office Gossip, Mad about Alice, Adrian Mole, Trevor's world of Sport,Revolver, Doctors and Nurses, The Crouches and many other dreadful series' that never made it past the first season and of the nine shows i've listed above only one made it to a 2nd series thus far - the criminally unfunny and unbelivable Ardal O' Hanlon Veichle 'My Hero' which seems to go on forever. 'My Family' is a simple comedy about Dentist Ben Harper (Robert Lindsay) his wife Tour Guide Susan (Zoe 'son of Sam' Wanamaker) and their long suffering family :- Geek Michael, Bimbo Janey and weirdo Nick.",/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2005,fritz2525,," Reason why I love Brit shows
","I LOVE THIS SHOW!!! Its so funny! This family isn't really that perfect nor bad. Its just an average family with some unfortunate events stuff. I think Micheal is so funny but sometimes u just wanna give him a slap on the head for being so stupid. My fave character however is Abbey--the cousin. She reminds me so much of Phoebe from FRIENDS. She was a really good casting and one of the best character in the show I think. How come their daughter (I forgot her name), wasn't in the show then later showed up? Whats up with that? Did something happen or what? Thanks to YTV (a channel here on Toronto) for having this show lined up in their schedule from Monday to Thursday. ",/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2001,iluvmax666,," Brilliant!
","Not an original summary really sums up how I feel about this great comedy. Robert Lindsay is hilarious (and strangely attractive) as the incredibly cynical Ben and Kris Marshall just as funny as Nick. However, in my opinion the star turn is Zoe Wanamaker ( v. sexy) and words dont do her justice. Watch out for the funeral scene in the new series where she is taking 'unprescribed' flu medication and is to put it bluntly, stoned. Her performance here is understated and fabulous, not staggering around, just glassy eyed wierdness. Please watch this (and the repeats on UK Gold) It wont tax your brain and we all need a good laugh sometimes :-) The scary part? I see some of my family in them!",/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2022,miaalike,6," Just above average, as it is funny, but does not avoid caricatures and easy laughs
","Some episodes are one of a kind, others are just routine. As is their perpetual position on the fail side, in what most of the things required from a family are concerned. It is sharp, mean, fun, but it almost entirely lacks a soul, nuances, or depth in the humour.",/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2005,sexy_pisces_gal,," Hilarious Comedy !!!
","This hilarious comedy offers a truly honest insight the daily life of a typical middle-class family. Robert Lindsay is at his comical best as Ben Harper, a grumpy middle-aged dentist who has great difficulty holding onto a dental assistant, whilst Zoë Wanamaker is his witty and waspish wife, a woman with the deluded notion that she is a fantastic cook which the entire Harper family do theire best to try and get out of eating. The real star of this sitcom is the eldest son Nick played to perfection by Kris Marshal. In his early twenties Nicks main objective is to lie around the house floating from one dead end job to another much to his father continued annoyance. Deniela Denby-Ashe is the harpers middle child Janey, shallow and obsessed with fashion she will use anyone to get what she wants even if it means hurting her hopelessly devoted boyfriend Stupid Brian. At the bottom of the pack is the runt of the litter, little Micheal Harper geeky, and bright. He is determined to become the next prime minister, but Michael's main weakness is women- something he has no clue about and tries to rectify with hilarious consequences.",/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv

3 October 2005,Sylviastel,7," A Delightful uneven show!
","I like My Family. NJN started showing it in the place of ""Last of the Summer Wine"" or what I like to call ""British version of Desperate Housewives."" I much prefer them to anything on television. In fact, I love British comedies and I only saw My Family briefly on a British Airways flight 2 years ago so now I have it at least once a week. I love Zoe Wanamaker C.B.E. and Tony winning Robert Lindsay although the children actors have to compete with such talent. It's nice to see a British family for a change. On British shows, children are often never shown. I loved the premiere pilot with the bunny rabbit and would gladly give it a home. I thought it was cute that Zoe and Lindsary were talking to him like a member of the family. I look forward to more episodes of this show. BBC should do more to create comedies. I always prefer the Brits to the American comedies any day.",/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2002,KRAFTEDOUT,," refreshing
","I'm so pleased with this Brit-com.  Although, I don't know how many episodes there are, I think we are only seeing the first block, here at home.  I do hope there is other blocks.  It's so refreshing, the acting, and comedic timing, is bang on.  The series, does carry some of the american strategy, but it's the popular british wit, that connects the two.  Hope to see more of this series.",/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2002,BladeBitten,," I would like to say this about My Family
","Wonderfull! The first My Family episode I saw was the final episode of the first series. I started to tape the second series when it came on tv, and got every episode. Always on the lookout for series 1, I taped them when I saw them, and now taping the third series, 5 mins away from taping episode 4 of series 3 as I type this. This is a great British sitcom, It is sooooo hard to find good (In My Family's case, GREAT) British comedy programmes. Given Bottom which has a certain age rating, My Family is sure enough to make 18 y/o p**s their pants in laughter. There is a great cast. Ben, always the frustrated stress-pot, Suzan, the witty scheming mother, Nick (who has to be credited as the most humorous member of the family and series) as the pillock, Janey, the sexy sassy teenage daughter, and Michael, the quiet and brainy smart-ass. Result = Magic. If you haven't seen My Family, your missing out! Watch it!!!!!!!!!",/review/rw0753562/?ref_=tt_urv
