24 February 2017,grantss,8," Great follow-up to a brilliant movie
","20 years after betraying his friends and running off with (almost) all the money from a scam, Mark Renton is back in Edinburgh. It is his first time back since the events that split him, Spud and Simon apart. He looks up Spud and Simon but their lives are hardly much better than when he last saw them. Spud, after getting his life together, has seen it all unravel, to the point that he is suicidal. Simon is running his father's loss-making pub, in between bouts of blackmail. Meanwhile, the fourth person in their caper of 20 years' ago, the psychotically intense Begbie, is in jail. He has no intention of staying incarcerated and revenge is foremost on his mind...",/review/rw3868041/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2017,mattjkav,8," A quite different vibe to part 1, and undeserved of the bad reviews
","I was the key demographic for the first film when it was released. I somehow snuck into the theater a few years shy of being 18 (and legal) to see it, and it had the same effect on me that it did on so many. The slick production, now-iconic soundtrack, grimy aesthetic, grim humor - it hit me hard (pun intended). Of course at that age, as gen-x cynical and world-weary as I thought myself, I was naive. Drugs were still novel, I was yet to see how dark and sad an actual addiction would look like. On some unconscious level I felt like I would live forever. A misplaced sense of my own intrinsic genius would allow me to balance an appreciation of the seedier, self destructive elements of the world with the actuality of my own inevitable personal success. As such, I walked out of Trainspotting 1 with a spring in my step. It was fun, fast, clever and a quick and temporary tour through some really ugly things. It was 'cool'.

29 May 2017,tomgillespie2002,6," A welcome send-off to a beloved ensemble of characters
","As we are frequently reminded during the course of T2, it's been 20 years since Danny Boyle's iconic and culturally eye-opening Trainspotting. Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) and his cronies, in a monologue no doubt quotable to anybody who was a teenager in 1996, famously decided not to choose life, and instead were on course for a wasted existence of heroin addiction and crime. The main question asked by this sequel is: Was it worth it? The group fans were so eager to see back together may have less hair and more body fat, but they have finally put aside personal squabbles (McGregor and Boyle made up after the former was overlooked in favour of Leonard Di Caprio for The Beach) and worked around ongoing contracts to reunite. While T2 struggles to find a consistent tone and somewhat falls apart during its final act, it will no doubt put a smile on any fan's face.",/review/rw3868041/?ref_=tt_urv

5 June 2018,bob the moo,," Has enough style and energy to get over its weaknesses, and has a lot that will work for people of a certain age
","The return of Trainspotting to the screen such a weird bit of timing. The cast are almost all moved on to very successful careers in cinema and television, with a range of big and personal projects between them. Likewise the film sits in a period in the mid-90's where cinema seemed so vibrant with ideas and new directors (most of whom are now the new establishment); so returning to a place with that establishment didn't think it would work - particularly seeing so many big name actors trying to convince as broken shells. It felt like it would be an exercise in looking back, rather than being a new film in and of itself.",/review/rw3868041/?ref_=tt_urv

18 March 2017,subxerogravity,7," It was OK, If you're looking for it to be more than that, too bad.
","It's an OK movie. Don't really need to see the first one to like the second one, as it's about four people reconnecting with each other after twenty years, and most of the story's content is like that. Although, most of the plot does revolve around what happen in the original movie and is implemented with the idea that you did see the first one as Mark stupidly returns to his old stomping grounds knowing he stole money from his ""mates""(As they say across the pond) and you can only imagine what happen afterwards.",/review/rw3868041/?ref_=tt_urv

","T2 Trainspotting is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific cast. As far as sequels go, it is incredibly fresh, there is no sign of it trying to copy or mimic the original movie. It really does try and succeeds at being its own thing, Danny Boyle clearly had a vision for this movie and achieved it stupendously.",/review/rw3868041/?ref_=tt_urv

","After 21 years of waiting, the sequel to 'Trainspotting' has finally become a reality, and what a fantastic ride it is. Sure it lacks the flare that made the original the classic it is, but with new ideas and a worthy plot that wraps up the original's ending, 'T2 Trainspotting' finds inventive ways to allow us to love the characters we grew up with.",/review/rw3868041/?ref_=tt_urv

30 March 2017,george.schmidt,10," The boys are back in this welcome sequel; one of the year's best films.
","T2 TRAINSPOTTING (2017) **** Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Robert Carlyle, Jonny Lee Miller, Anjela Nedyalkova, Kelly Macdonald, Shirley Henderson, James Cosmo, Pauline Turner, Scot Greenan. The boys are back - Scotland's bad boys that is in this welcome sequel to the indie classic about four friends whose drug habits got them into a crime that ended poorly for three has them reunited when Renton (McGregor) comes back home for the funeral of his estranged mother and finds his buds Simon aka Sick Boy (Miller) and Spud (Bremner) more or less the same but with grudges and smack still in the mix, and a vengeful Begbie (Carlyle) busting out of prison for murderous score settling. Based on Irvine Welsh's novels, John Hodge's screenplay echoes the original perfectly as well as filmmaker Danny Boyle's sharp directing skills intact. Fine acting by the foursome and a nice, canny turn by Nedyalkova as Sick Boy's love interest and partner-in-crime the film has underpinnings of genuine poignancy (largely due to a bittersweet performance by Bremner) and a great re-hash of the Choose Life speech by McGregor that hits the floor running. One of the best films of the year.",/review/rw3868041/?ref_=tt_urv

","Following in the recent trend of dated sequels, reboots and kick-starts (literally and figuratively) here Danny Boyle's 90s cult classic gets a final shot in the arm; loosely hanging its narrative and character development around Irving Welsh's literary sequel 'Porno' and trying to circumnavigate a world two decades older – and wearier – than its predecessor (despite the book only giving way to nine).",/review/rw3868041/?ref_=tt_urv

16 April 2020,Ruskington,5," A watchable but totally unnecessary sequel
","T2T starts off ok; the original cast look great, the Edinburgh landscape is perfectly atmospheric and the music is good (I mean it's not a patch on the original soundtrack but that would be close to impossible). There are plenty of great one-liners and some strong comedic acting from the adorable Ewen Bremner. Jonny Lee Miller and Ewan McGregor give solid performances and Robert Carlyle, while still a bit over-the-top, is just as intimidating and maniacal as he was 21 years before.",/review/rw3868041/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. Sequels are big business in Hollywood these days. In fact, it's not unusual for sequels to be announced even before the premiere of the first! At the other end of the spectrum we have cult films which carry the added pressure of not disappointing (or worse) their rabid fan base. Such is the case with Trainspotting from 1996. So the big question is  can the much anticipated follow up generate the frenetic pace and enjoyable discomfort of the first? ",/review/rw3868041/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2017,calmalley,9," Masterful on its own merits, respectful to its predecessor.
","T2 is all you could hope a sequel can be. Independent and respectful to its predecessor while standing on its own merits as a great movie, art even, powerful maybe. 20 years on things have changed,mostly. It's funny,sad and mature above all else. Boyles directing is complemented with a great script and beautiful cinematography. On to the important aspects, the film plays cleverly With nostalgia without depending on it,giving the audience of the 1996 cult classic something to savor, while also standing independently as an entertaining and even inventive film. Performances are a solid as you'd expect, Robert Carlyle returns in a fantastic albeit expected performance as begbie. The film introduces the advancement in technology over the intervening years with inventive and clever special effects, however the original also boasted some amazing trick of the lens. Finally upon leaving the cinema one gets a feeling of bittersweet and sorrowful fulfillment, the characters we've come to know over the last 20 years hive us nearly two hours of nostalgia packed entertainment, yet one can't help but long for its energetic,frenetic and classic predecessor, no matter how good its sequel is, and it is.",/review/rw3868041/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2017,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8," By all accounts this should've been a disappointment, yet here we have a sequel that not only matches the quality of the original but, for me, even surpasses it.
","What 'Trainspotting 2 (2017)' does so brilliantly is maintain a consistently dramatic thematic through-line that believably builds upon the fallout from the events that shaped the first film's ending. Each of its fantastically drawn characters deals with the past twenty years in very different but equally valid and expertly expressed ways. The belated sequel also stands head-and-shoulders above others of the kind in its inherent ability to deftly handle the references to its predecessor that come with the territory of such an endeavour. By amalgamating these callbacks into the very DNA of its story, the flick ultimately crafts a tale brimming with beautifully melancholic nostalgia, a heartbreaking yet stomach-twisting inevitability and the almost tangible sense of what might have been. Although it arguably, in some small ways, changes the essence of a couple of characters (Begbie in particular), the feature displays a remarkable understanding of its source material. It never makes a notable misstep, actually developing all its key players far more than they ever were in the original 'Trainspotting (1996)' and making them much more relatable in the process. Ultimately, it's a funny yet poignant piece which is more focused than its predecessor but still retains some of its occasionally eclectic hyperactivity, striking an impressive balance between the two differing styles to create what now seems like a highly logical and equally necessary continuation. As if all that weren't enough, it's also superbly directed, introducing an energetic visual splendour to its urban Scottish setting, and supremely entertaining. It's incredibly interesting and amazingly engaging. I actually think I may prefer this film to the first. 8/10.",/review/rw3868041/?ref_=tt_urv
