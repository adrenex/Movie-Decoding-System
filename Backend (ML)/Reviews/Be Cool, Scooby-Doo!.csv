1 April 2021,siderite,8," The Miseducation of Natalia Dyer
","If you watched The Miseducation of Cameron Post, this film is almost identical, only much more about hypocrisy and no lesbianism. The Kirkos christian retreat depicted in the film actually exists, only it's called Kairos, and the story in the movie seems to be rooted at least partially in an actual experience. I was really expecting this to have been a book adaptation, just like Cameron Post, but it wasn't.",/review/rw5720610/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2020,Jeremy_Urquhart,5," While not bad, it was a letdown
","Disappointing that it's sort of just another coming of age movie, taking the tropes and side characters that you usually see in those movies and using them pretty ordinarily here. With the premise it had, I really wish it had been funnier, crazier, edgier, or just a little less predictable.",/review/rw5720610/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2020,TxMike,," Semi-autobiographical movie.
",The writer/director Karen Maine went to a Catholic school in Iowa and made this movie based on her own experiences there in the 11th grade. I didn't attend a Catholic school but grew up being taught Catechism by Priests and Nuns so I can identify with a lot of it.,/review/rw5720610/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2020,CinemaClown,," An Honest, Amusing & Relatable Account Of A Young Girl's Sexual Awakening
","An honest, funny & thoroughly relatable account of a young girl's sexual awakening, Yes, God, Yes is short, simple & straightforward in its approach, and is brilliantly led by Natalia Dyer's sweet & amusing performance. There is a sincerity in this coming-of-age portrayal and a proper understanding of that awkward teenage phase which makes this film both fun & evocative.",/review/rw5720610/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2020,arungeorge13,6," I liked it for what it is, even though not particularly memorable! [+62%]
","Karen Maine's Yes, God, Yes won me over for its slice of 2000s nostalgia and the way it portrayed some very relatable things in the lives of teenagers of those times. The story is a little too simplistic, and it doesn't try to bite off more than it can chew. In that sense, the film's climax probably won't seem too revolutionary when viewed in 2020 where 'sinning' is more of an innuendo than something religious.",/review/rw5720610/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2020,delamancarose,5," It was okay.
","Being homeschooled and a christian growing up in a very humble lifestyle and household, I appreciate the message they were trying to get across in this movie. You grow up with so many restrictions and when you're out of that fearful environment it truly is a wake up call. Knowing that people have been doing what you have been forbidden to do for years and they are alright. I like seeing movies like this where I can relate somewhat to the plot. It wasn't really amazing or the best movie I've seen but it was a good message I think. I have absolutely no idea why it was rated R since it was pretty tame for what else comes out these days but maybe I'm wrong? Anyway I loved Natalia Dryer, even though she's well in her twenties, she can still pull off a teenager pretty well.",/review/rw5720610/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2020,themadmovieman,7," A charming coming-of-age film with a wonderful message
","A really solid coming-of-age drama that portrays the transition from innocent youth to world-weary adult in stark fashion, Yes, God, Yes blends sobering drama with charming humour and charisma in a short but punchy tale of personal growth and discovery.",/review/rw5720610/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2020,AdamDroge,5," Conceptually interesting, but messy execution
","I'd heard buzz about this movie from various sources, so I decided to check it out on Netflix. It's about an awkward and shy teen girl going to Catholic school that is Hellfire and Brimstone towards sexuality of any sort outside marriage, but girl is going through a sexual awakening, so we have conflict.",/review/rw5720610/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2020,cloudbri,8," LOVED this movie! Any ex-catholic will
","This movie is so spot-on about what it's like going to a Catholic School. I don't know if I would have enjoyed it as much as I did if I hadn't been raised Catholic and gone to a Catholic high School. The humor is subtle, but it's good. Go into this movie open-minded and I think you'll really enjoy it.",/review/rw5720610/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2020,billcr12,8," Good Concept
","As someone who had experience with Catholic school for my first six years in the 1960's, I could appreciate the story of a girl struggling with the concept of sin and hypocrisy. Natalia Dyer is a sixteen year-old girl who comes across a chat room online and acts upon her feelings of lust; one of the seven deadly sins, of course, and one which would send you to the fires of hell. George Carlin did a routine on impure thoughts and this continues in that vain. Dyer stays at a four day Catholic retreat with constant lectures by a priest who is not so pure himself. This is not an anti-Catholic film in any respect. It only shows the difficulty for all of us in dealing with sin and our personal failings as human beings. I can pray the Rosary every day and still have a problem with the Church of Rome and their rules. Meanwhile, Yes, God, Yes is an excellent film.",/review/rw5720610/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2020,roger-99-171599,7," Funny, Non-Judgmental Sexual Awakening Story
","After writing the winsome comedy ""Obvious Child"", Karen Maine puts her talent to work behind the cameras with this satisfying directorial debut. An irreverent satire on religious principles and hormonal behavior, the film follows the sexual awakening of a High School Catholic teen girl whose explicit online interaction with a stranger arises her curiosity towards the prohibited. Her quest for understanding herself, the pleasures of sexuality, and acceptance increase and gain shape during a Christian Camp where she witnesses some unusual, scandalously freaky encounters. Natalia Dyer is fantastic, funny and relevant as the heroine trying to figure out herself while observing and learning from the hypocrisy surrounding her. Winner of the Special Jury Award at SXSW it's a refreshing, provocative and smart little gem.",/review/rw5720610/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2021,mattfrancis-03963,6," Ratings are about right
","So Natalie Dyer is a turn on, no not because of her age or innocence, the music is alright, Alice's struggles are genuine and believable, there's much praise for god. But with all the disturbing built up frustration and the type of characters we see this type of stuff speaks volumes for clear underlying mental illnesses for the creators lol. I mean, every film of this type is exactly the same. A girl sees a b. J and lives a boring life then starts fantasying. Meanwhile her friends around her do whatever they please. It's so obvious. Sadly it's more important obvious the movie underachieved.",/review/rw5720610/?ref_=tt_urv

24 August 2020,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,8," I genuinely liked this film alot
","I hadn't anticipated watching this title, but there wasn't much else on so I gave it a try. I genuinely ended up liking it a lot. Mostly because this is one of the few films that gets Catholicism right so I can only imagine their must have been some real Catholics in the production of this film.",/review/rw5720610/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2020,isantistao,8," The Film On Christianity & Sexuality The World So Needs!
","Here it is, finally a film exposing the paradoxical nature of christian sexuality, which it does in the most hilarious ways! This movie shows the reality of human sexuality and how conflicting and hypocritical it is to try to put it into the moral box that christianity tries to and fails. As well as showing a lot of other funny aspects of both christianity and human social nature. This movie had me laughing out loud many times and was really smart and well done and is something that the world really needs to see! So I hope you watch it!",/review/rw5720610/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2020,Rena24,9," Wow!! A Gem In The Wild
","Kudos to Karen Maine!! Her writing is spot on in how she has managed to tell and share the truth (The Hypocrisy of religion) in a way that I can personally relate with. Natalia Dyer was phenomenal, her expressions, reactions, and screen presence was absolutely spot on. everyone should watch this movie. I am glad I found it.",/review/rw5720610/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2020,arthur_tafero,7," Much Better Than Average Coming of Age Film - Yes, God, Yes
","I liked this film because it examined the obvious hypocrites involved in extra-curricular religious activities. And that goes across the board for all religions and all extra-curricular religious activities, such as retreats and the like. The film is quite funny, and the lead actress does a great job, as do all of the supporting actors. But the real star here is the writer and director (who obviously went to a Parochial School, as I myself did). I can relate to the onerous cloud of guilt that is perpetuated by the religious zealots of all religions. It is a common denominator. The coming (literally) of age sexually is a very commonplace occurrence, and is within the natural order of things; however religion somehow tries to deny nature at every turn. I thought the two funniest scenes were the chocolate pudding lid licking and the oven/microwave metaphor for girls and boys by the cleric. Good stuff and not to be missed.",/review/rw5720610/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2020,admanpa-81096,7," Actually quite good
","Ignore some of the bad user reviews. This is a short 1 hour 10 mins good be coming of age comedy. It's second theme of religious hypocrisy is gently made.
A Catholic in my family found it amusing.
So give it a go.",/review/rw5720610/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2021,deloudelouvain,7," Laughing with the religious freaks, my favorite pastime.
","Yes, God, Yes is an entertaining coming of age comedy. Well it's a comedy for those who like to laugh at those religious imbeciles. Because that's what's it basically is, laughing with the insane strict rules they have, and the belief you will go to hell and eternal damnation if you don't march on the straight path they endoctrinated into you. I had fun watching this, but I'm not sure any religious idiot will have the same fun. There's a good message at the end what made it even better. The acting was certainly not bad and that from the whole cast. It's quite simple as a story, no major budget needed to tell this story, but it works, so no complaints here.",/review/rw5720610/?ref_=tt_urv

9 May 2020,cdwelcome-51-56444,8," Fantastic Direction in this Indie Gem
","I had the great fortune of seeing Yes, God, Yes in the Emerging Director section of the St. Louis International Film Festival. The film is pitch perfect, and lead actress Natalia Dyer (Stranger Things) carries the film with tension and humor. I will watch this film again, and certainly recommend it as often as possible. Director Karen Maine's mastery keeps this film moving forward with precision and never misses a beat.",/review/rw5720610/?ref_=tt_urv
