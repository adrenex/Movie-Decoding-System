28 May 2005,mstomaso,8," Very well made military drama
","The suspense is relentless in this believable, tense and superbly acted war drama. One of the best modern war movies I have seen, Crimson Tide is a story about strained loyalty, respect, command, discipline, power, and military practice. Hackman and Washington are perfectly cast as an older battle-hardened nuclear submarine captain and his younger, less experienced but highly educated executive officer, caught in a crisis of potentially world-threatening proportions. Pursued by an enemy submarine, the USS Alabama has nuclear warheads aimed and ready to fire as a pre-emptive strike against a Russian rebel commanding his own nuclear arsenal. The Alabama is commanded to launch, and begins preparations, but the enemy sub attacks, knocking out all communications just as a second command is being received. The nature of that second command and what to do about then becomes the key problem that the Captain and XO have to deal with. Suffice to say, they do not agree on how to proceed, and the remainder of the film is a struggle between the two men and those who support each, in a crippled but still lethal sub, with the fate of the world hanging in the balance.",/review/rw0359196/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2004,underfire35,9," One Of The Best Submarine Movies...
","As CRIMSON TIDE opens we visit various crew members of the USS Alabama as they bid farewell to their loved ones.  For one man, Lt. Cmdr. Ron Hunter (Denzel Washington), it will be his first time as second in command of a nuclear submarine.  Capt. Frank Ramesy (Gene Hackman) is in charge and is not shy about letting everyone know.  He is a seasoned veteran, as juxtaposed with the young idealistic Hunter.  The early scenes do much to set up the main conflict of the film.  For example when members of the crew discuss Carl Von Clausewitz, and his 1832 work Vom Kriege (""On War""), the intellectual showdown occurs between Ramesy and Hunter.  This scene not only heightens the tension, but also reveals the different philosophies of these two men, what they believe in, why they are there.  This short scene goes a long way to setting up why each of these characters are so unbending when the crisis presents itself.",/review/rw0359196/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2006,SmileysWorld,8," Intense!
","I love this film for it's intensity,particularly the intense relationship of the characters portrayed by Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington.They are two men at odds in the worst of situations;the possibility of war.It all involves an incomplete transmission.It could mean war,it could mean nothing at all.What do you do?You could strike your enemy before he strikes you,but would the strike be uncalled for? It's the not knowing that creates the intensity.Hackman and Washington are excellent actors,which goes without saying since they are both Oscar winners,and they play off of each other extremely well in this film. This fact alone makes it a must see,but the film's content is equally as impressive.",/review/rw0359196/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2004,tfrizzell,," Red Alert, Red Alert, Red Alert, Red Alert....
","Tense little action thriller on par with ""The Hunt for Red October"" has a nuclear submarine commander (Gene Hackman) and his new second-in-command (Denzel Washington) getting in a chess match of words and wits ala ""Mutiny on the Bounty"". Russian rebels may be about to launch nuclear missiles at any moment. Commands come through for Hackman to detonate the weapons from their ship, but then another message after that one which is incomplete splits the entire crew. Hackman thinks it is time to take control with aggression while Washington believes that this is way too important without knowing everything there is to know. A wide range of characters on the submarine (which includes Viggo Mortensen, Steve Zahn, James Gandolfini, Rick Schroeder, George Dzundza) must decide which of the all-world performers they are going to side with. The screenplay is mediocre really, but Hackman and Washington know how to overcome that and director Tony Scott keeps the pulse of his audience in high over-drive. Definitely an acceptable piece from the genre. 4 stars out of 5.",/review/rw0359196/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2002,Agent10,7," Tension and suspense achieved
","This is the type of movie Tony Scott should have stuck to creating. While most Jerry Bruckheimer films prove to be bad, modern interpretations of old school martial arts movies, this was one of the better films Bruckheimer ever produced. While the story was completely plot-driven and the performances a little over the top, the rivalry between Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman made this film a cut above the rest of the trash Bruckheimer tends to produce. While simple and direct, it proves to be effective in the annals of storytelling, never overindulging the viewer.",/review/rw0359196/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2004,rmsmythe,10," intelligent, intense, well-acted
","Crimson Tide possesses one of the most intense moments in film: two great actors eye-to-eye, portraying characters absolutely certain of their actions, absolutely convinced that the other's course will lead to disaster. A submarine commander (Hackman) and his second-in-command (Washington) are both shouting at the same time, each ordering the next ranking officer (Dzundza) to arrest the other. Washington believes, with good reason that Hackman is unfit to command because he is disregarding naval procedures. Hackman believes, with good reason, that Washington is disobeying an order and instigating a mutiny. A possible nuclear exchange and the deaths of billions hang in the balance. Dzundza knows that he must make the correct decision, regardless of his like or dislike of each of his superiors.",/review/rw0359196/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2005,JamesHitchcock,7," A Post Cold-War Thriller
","How does one make a Cold War thriller now that the Cold War is over? One way of doing this would be simply to make the film as a historical period piece, and this was the solution adopted in another submarine drama, the more recent ""K-19 The Widowmaker"". Political thrillers however, are at their most effective when they confront us with a scenario that could happen today, or in the near future, and lose some of their impact when they deal with something that might have happened- but didn't- in the past. ""The Crimson Tide"" deals essentially with something that might have happened in the sixties or seventies, but in order to maintain its immediacy it is set in the nineties, with a group of nationalist Russian rebels playing the part that the Soviet government might have played in an earlier film. A similar device was used in ""Air Force One"", another political thriller from the mid-nineties.",/review/rw0359196/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2005,Schaden,6," Perspective from a real nuclear submariner
","( I wrote a lot more but had to edit cause of the 1000 word limit) As a drama Hollywood type sub flick, I gave Crimson Tide a 6. But I just watched it on HBO tonight and have to say it is one of the most unrealistic sub movies I've ever seen. I was in the silent service and qualified in submarines. Of course a lot of what I'll write would not bother the casual viewer, but the discrepancies, details and plot were just too much to overlook. ",/review/rw0359196/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2002,johnnymonsarrat,7," Jon Monsarrat review: intelligent and thrilling
","Although billed as a film about a deep issue (how much control submarine commanders should have over their nuclear weapons), Crimson Tide is really a straight action flick in my opinion. However, it is intelligent and definitely a cut above the action/thriller stereotype.",/review/rw0359196/?ref_=tt_urv

","Excellent military drama with more intrigue and thrills than action. There is a clash of wills between the Captain(Gene Hackman)and his Lt. Commander(Denzel Washington)aboard the nuclear submarine USS Alabama. The mission is to avert an impending nuclear conflict with Russia. Hackman and Washington are tense and superb.

3 September 2000,doofy51,9," Wow! What an adrenaline rush!
","Crimson Tide is awesome in the way it creates intensity and non-stop adrenaline rushes using scenes full of action, and scenes that aren't. The torpedo attack with the Russian sub was so fast-paced and packed with energy that it makes you bounce in your seat. Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington gave awesome performances, and their growing tension towards each other is enough to keep the excitement at a consistent high through the last half of the film. I don't appreciate how Hackman's character is regarded by most moviegoers as a mad man. He is just simply a seasoned, tough-as-nails military officer who must assume that the US is in danger, and he must stick by the orders that require him to go to drastic measures to protect us. The director did a good job at raising the tension, even though the ending was very predictable. The message at the very start of the film set the perfect tone. The entire film is in a way scary by making us wonder if what would happen in a situation like this, and how could the military establish proper operating procedures for it. However, the message at the end of the film re-establishes some hope. 9/10, and I love the creative title.",/review/rw0359196/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2011,The-Sarkologist,8," With half a message and no way to confirm, do you start World War III?
","This film is a political thriller in the vain of Tom Clancy novels. Actually, I don't think political thriller is the exact title that one would use for this film, but I think that it is the closet description that I would give it. Anyway, it is a film set on the brink of world war III. A mad Russian general has captured a military base when the rebellion in Chechnya spilled over into neighbouring republics. Capturing the base he then made a threat that he was going to launch missiles at the United States so their subs are sent out. The situation reaches a point where they are about to launch the missiles so the US orders a nuclear strike. But a couple of minutes later another message is sent out but the sub receives only half of it which leads to a conflict between the captain and the executive officer as to what course to take. The captain wants a nuclear strike while the XO wants to confirmation of the orders.",/review/rw0359196/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2013,ironhorse_iv,8," Roll Tide!! Crimson Tide is a pretty good movie.
","World War III is about to break out in the Tony Scott's movie 'Crimson Tide', when political turmoil in Russia has caused worries in United States when Russia ultra-nationalists threaten to launch nuclear missiles at them. The movie focuses on the military mission of the USS Alabama, a nuclear submarine whom duty is to launch missions back into Russia if war breaks out. The submarine is split in conflicting opinions and wills between the seasoned commanding officer Captain Frank Ramsey (Gene Hackman) and the new executive officer Lt. Ron Hunter (Denzel Washington) on the interpretations of an order to launch their missiles. In the nuclear world, the true enemy is war itself. The movie has this 'Mutiny of the Bounty' feel to it, as the audience is swept into a very plausible scenario between Hunter's more analytical, cautious approach, as opposed to Ramsey's more impulsive and intuitive approach to the mission. Great acting from both of them. I love the exchange between Hackman and Washington on the topic of Lipizzaner horses and Von Clausewitz' view of war. Indeed, all the actors have their moments to shine, including Viggo Mortensen, James Gandolfini and an excellent George Dzundza. The movie is a great suspense with an amazing music score by Hans Zimmer. The heavy use of synthesizers in place of traditional orchestral instruments sound chilling like an old Gothic church's choirs. The well-known naval hymn, ""Eternal Father, Strong to Save"" is given an new spin into it. It's great to note that Harry Gregson-Williams help with the bass thumbing. Great to hear on large speakers the score. The movie has excellent visuals for a smart and tense film. Now to the faults of the film, while Richard Hendrick wrote the novel, he probably knew little about submarines as a lot of the real life Navy's submariners didn't like the film. The movie had many breaches of naval protocols that it became too unrealizable to them. Example are such like Supply Officers are restricted, and cannot be put into a position to where they could take command. They don't have the training to do so. The real life Navy regulations would have Hunter disciplined for insubordination and replaced with another XO no matter what happen on the boat. Still, I like the submarine lingoes, even if I didn't understand them. Both Washington and Hackman play stereotypical roles to the point, it's seem more about a race issue between Black VS White, than an issue about launching nuclear weapons. Who brings up semi-racism likes comments like what color the most trained horse are? Was the racial subtext, necessary? The way, Denzel Washington talks to his subordinates as if they are children is a bit odd. I wouldn't have thought for once a Star Trek or a Silver Surfer reference was going to be in this type of film. Don't get me wrong, it's cool to hear it, but I would love for the movie in those scenes to be taking more serious. What part of the Navy allows a dog on submarine unless it's a K9 unit? Even if you're the captain, I doubt you can bring a dog to pee everywhere. Forget about Tide. Even Clorox could not clean up that mistake. Overall: Crimson Tide is a great movie. Worth watching.",/review/rw0359196/?ref_=tt_urv

","Russia is suffering political instability as rebels threaten launching nuclear war against US and Japan. The US sends nuclear submarine, the Alabama, off to sea. Captain Ramsey (Gene Hackman) needs a new XO. Commander Hunter (Denzel Washington) is brought on board. The two are cordial at first, but soon differences surface.

25 March 2020,brandonmwms-52892,7," Well, from a former Strategic Missile Officer on a Trident
","So, unlike any other movie, I can say that I thoroughly understand the issues posed in Crimson Tide. Gene Hackman's character was based on my own captain who advised on this movie. The movie is entertaining and exciting. And the plot goes to great lengths to create the dilemma faced by the USS Alabama. Most importantly, the attack by the Akula and the loss of communications are the central points that drive the narrative. In that tense setting I can almost believe that the tension between a strong CO and XO could spill out into a disagreement, but no further. Officers pointing guns at other officers offends me most deeply. The racist comments by the captain would not have been conceivable even in the 1990's, the setting for the movie. There are numerous liberties taken with protocol, liturgy, and procedures of how a SSBN operates. But overall they were well coached on how a submarine runs. Even after 20+ years separated from my own experience, the movie greatly blemishes the unbelievable professionalism and expertise of an American nuclear submarine crew. But the exemplary, expert, and efficient performance of any American submarine sailors would make a terribly predictable and boring movie. Thank God.",/review/rw0359196/?ref_=tt_urv
