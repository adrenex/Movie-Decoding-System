11 November 2004,desperateliving,," 7/10
","There's something enormously touching about this film and the way it deals with losses -- Pullman's wife and Casper's mother, in particular. And what's so clever about it is how it uses them as a tool of audience manipulation AND has the evil ghosts use Pullman in exactly the same way that we're being used. This is a smartly written screenplay. The story itself is pretty conventional and predictable: the loner girl gets teased by a popular girl (that nobody really likes) who's out to destroy her; the popular girl has a cute boyfriend that the loner girl has the hots for, etc. etc., story will resolve itself with everyone falling in love with loner girl.",/review/rw3609894/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2004,jdkraus,8," An all-time family favorite that's very touching!
","Ever since i was six years of age, I've enjoyed this movie. It makes me laugh, cry, and excited! i am disappointed that so many people don't like this movie. it is an all-time favorite of mine. It is sad yes, but it has comic relief from the three uncles that try to be humanlike, Casper, the friendly ghost that knows what it is like to be lonely, for instance me, and same with Kat. I am very touched with this film, for it makes me think about me, lonely and depressed, but it has a positive ending which I really adored! i also liked the amazing effects, that were famous at its, time. Of course now, effects from movies are like The Matrix films and LOTR, but i mainly like this film, because it tocuhes my heart in a both sad and sometimes happy, knowing, someone else is out there for you, even if you are a bit...dead. 10/10",/review/rw3609894/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 1999,Boyo-2,9," For adults too!
","Being 'middle-aged', I suppose I was not the target audience for this movie, but I love it very much anyway.  Kiddies aside, this movie is hysterical, well-acted, and touching too. The effects are great and, to be honest, I can't find a lot to critcize here, which for me is all I can ask of a movie.",/review/rw3609894/?ref_=tt_urv

15 November 2009,TheLittleSongbird,8," A winner of a family film- Casper is so cute!
","I really liked this movie, I seriously don't get the low rating. It is a most enjoyable family film, that is really sweet. My only complaints are one or two dull spots in the script and plot(primarily in the middle) and I didn't feel as though the direction was as good as it could have been. The special effects however are simply wonderful, and the sets are suitably dark and Gothic. But what made this movie for me was Casper, forgive me but he is so cute. The whole movie is well worth seeing just for him, but there are many other good things about this film too. The dance sequence especially is delightful.",/review/rw3609894/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," Since when did Casper become romantic?
","Casper, the friendly ghost, is now in computer form! :D I have to admit, when I became a teenager, I doubted this movie just to be kinda cool and not enjoy a kid's movie. But I babysit often, and my cousins wanted to watch this again, so I slipped it in. You know what? I enjoyed it and I think I'm willing to admit that I liked it.",/review/rw3609894/?ref_=tt_urv

14 June 2002,snowravyn,10," Great Movie With Various Perspectives
","After reading the comments, I see most people enjoy this movie with a few picking it over nothing (e.g. not an accurate portrait of ghost?).  I first saw the movie in my preteen.  It was a fun & 'cute' movie, highly entertaining with the trio & treasure hunting & stuff.",/review/rw3609894/?ref_=tt_urv

","I recall this film popping out of nowhere really, saw a trailer for it out of the blue, liked the look of it and went to see it. The creepy Addams Family visuals along with some really sweet looking effects hooked me and overall I really enjoyed this little kiddie flick.",/review/rw3609894/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2014,Rainey-Dawn,8," A Cute Film
","I found Casper to be quite entertaining. It's a great film for the entire family and a good one to watch around Halloween. The story is quite sad yet very funny and the special effects are superb. To summon up this film, I would say ""young love at it's finest"".",/review/rw3609894/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2014,slightlymad22,7," Perfect family entertainment
","I'll admit right from the off I'd never heard of 'Casper The Friendly Ghost' until 1993 when I went to my local multiplex to see the Kevin Costner and Clint Eastwood movie 'A Perfect World' in which a child steals a Halloween costume. So I didn't know much going into this movie. I believe this is the first feature film with a computer-animated title character, and for me the effects are outstanding.

29 March 2006,lee_eisenberg,7," Maybe there will always be the issue of life and death.
","On one level, maybe ""Casper"" is just a kids' movie. But it does bring up the question of how we deal with our own mortality. The plot involves unctuous Carrigan Crittenden (Cathy Moriarty) and her crony Dibbs (Eric Idle) inheriting an abandoned mansion in Maine, only to find out that it's inhabited by people-hating ghosts. After a few failed attempts to get rid of these spirits, they hire Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman), who claims that he can communicate with the dead. When he and his daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) move in, they have a few unpleasant encounters with the ghosts, but settle down. Thus arises the issue of how to cohabit with specters and also please Crittenden.",/review/rw3609894/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2002,Leanne Littrell,," Seeing it is BOOlieving it!
","Who says there are no such things as ghosts? Not if there is the ghostly inhabitants of Whipstaff Manor in Friendship, Maine! This desolate mansion is then, in the words of one of the members of the Ghostly Trio of Whipstaff, 'intruded' by Kat Harvey (Christina Ricci) and her eccentric father Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman), a ghost therapist. Carrigan Crittenden (Cathy Moriarty) had hired Dr. Harvey to exorcise the ghosts, including Casper the friendly ghost and his three obnoxious uncles, Stretch, Fatso and Stinkie, aspiring to gain Whipstaff's 'buried gold'.",/review/rw3609894/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2000,imbatman-2,," often beautiful, often creepy, mostly wonderful, but . . .
","I don't view films as if I'm watching them as the intended audience; I watch them for myself.  And that's why I found it odd at how engrossed I was when I watched this film for the first time at the age of eighteen.  Aside from the great gothic flair of the mansion, two superbly placed cameos, and nice laughable black humour from the ""trio,"" the film took off because of its emotional core.  It's something that a youngster can really get into, but also anyone who finds it sad that a child can die.  When Casper plays with his toys, I just wanted to start crying.  This eternal child--lost and stuck in an age of mystery and wonder.  And yet, he's smitten with a girl--he's starting to go through puberty.  And it's just so sad . . . and beautiful.

","Carrigan Crittenden (Cathy Moriarty) is angry that her father left her only a rundown mansion. Her sniveling lawyer Paul Plutzker (Eric Idle) finds out that it has buried pirate gold. The house is haunted by Casper the friendly ghost and his not-so-friendly uncles; Stretch, Fatso and Stinkie. Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman) became a therapist to the dead after the heartbreaking death of his wife and brings his daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) to every job.

1 November 2014,lisafordeay,6," I enjoyed this as a kid
","Casper is a 1995 film that stars Bill Pullman from While You Were Sleeping,Christina Ricci from Penellope and Brad Garrett who voices Fatso in this movie. The movie tells the story of Casper a friendly boy who happens to be a ghost. Kat Harvey(Ricci)and her dad Dr James Harvey(Pullman) (who is a ghost hunter btw)move to another city and land in a house that was once owned by a young boy who use to live there.But what Kat and her dad don't know is that Casper and his uncles Stretch,Fatso and Stinkie are still living in the house. Of course the reason why Dr Harvey moves is because these people(who were going to live in this house that they moved in,is haunted so he stays there with his daughter).Also Dr James Harvey lost his wife so he raises Kat by himself.",/review/rw3609894/?ref_=tt_urv

16 July 2020,IonicBreezeMachine,6," Better than what you'd think, but is dragged down by unfocused screenplay
","The 1995 film Casper came in the wake of a number of high profile films based on older properties. Some, like The Addams Family, Maverick, and Flintstones managed to achieve impressive box office and/or critical praise while others such as The Beverly Hillbillies, Car 54, Where Are You?, or Richie Rich were met with derision and scorn from critics and audiences. Casper falls somewhere towards to the upper end of the spectrum making it better than Flintstones by a considerable margin, but not nearly as funny or memorable as The Addams Family.
Casper, based on the Harvey Comics character turned star of Famous Studios' series of theatrical shorts, follows the titular friendly ghost as he deals with the schemes of heiress Carrigan Crittenden(played delightfully over the top by Cathy Moriarty), his brash abrasive uncles The Ghostly Trio, a grieving paranormal psychologist and his outsider daughter, and a whole host of shenanigans from either the living or the dead. Needless to say there's elements I'm leaving out because they're either resolved to quickly to be of merit or contribute nothing to the movie.",/review/rw3609894/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2004,sunbeam-4,7," Nice change...refreshing
","After you get through the stresses of your day... your job, the hassles of daily life, all the stressers that are out there daily, it seems great to sit back and enjoy something that will take you out of that for a little while. If you watch the news and read the papers every day like I do, it gets to you after a while...the young soldiers being killed in Iraq, all the election BS that we are being bombarded with right now...all or most of the news is downright depressing. That creates an important place for a movie like this...one that can make your life a little less serious for a while. I've always been a Christina Ricci fan, going back to the Addams Family when she was only 11 years old. She was a great actress even at that young age. You could tell that she would go far as an actress. The personality was there...it set her apart from her peers. At the age of 15, she continues to do a great job in Casper...she is very believable.

31 December 2016,Hitchcoc,6," Generally Forgettable
","The animation and action are fine in this film, and Casper is cute. The problem is that the bad guys are just that. They could be going after virtually any property. They reminded me of Cruela DeVille and her minions. They feel there is a treasure in the house and will stop at nothing to get it. Of course, when you have ghosts who are tricksters and concerned about their haunting place, they are going to retaliate. There are some nice scenes where Casper makes contact with the young girl and they become friends. Eric Idle is pretty funny as always. But overall, I walked away thinking nothing special. Typical of many movies made at that time.",/review/rw3609894/?ref_=tt_urv
