13 January 2019,makleen2,5," More concerned with pushing the filmmaker's social agenda than making us care who gains the English throne
","Historic authenticity is cast to the wind in this revisionist costume drama that feels like it was written by a freshman Women's Studies major. Directed by Josie Rourke with a screenplay by Beau Willimon, Mary Queen of Scots (2018) was based on the book Queen of Scots: The True Life of Mary Stuart by John Guy. Like many films released this year, it has strong female leads, a diverse cast, and progressive social messaging, but checking all the right boxes on the SJW playlist wasn't enough to save this film from mediocrity.",/review/rw4926687/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2019,deloudelouvain,5," Historical biographies need to be accurate and this one isn't.
",I only watched this movie because my wife likes historical costume drama's. The history of Mary Stuart was the subject I thought that would be interesting but the more I watched it the more I had the feeling this wasn't an accurate telling of facts. For example I really doubt there would be a Black lord or an Asian countess at that time in England. Add on that the rather boring repetitive story telling and you get just a mediocre movie. The main actresses Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie didn't do a bad job but the inaccuracy of the story just made Mary Queen Of Scots a movie I will forget everything about it in a week.,/review/rw4926687/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2019,AlsExGal,5," Interesting yarn, it's a shame it's largely untrue.
","Somebody else already called this film the ""woke"" version, and I would have to agree. A black counselor for Mary? An Asian noble woman in the English court? Wherever would they come from? It's not like you could jump on a plane and be anywhere in no time in 1565 And if you could, that you would be accepted when you got there.. Rizzio, Mary's secretary, and Darnley, Mary's second husband, gay? I have actually heard rumors and seen productions about Darnley maybe being bisexual as far back as the 1970s, but at the time, to be homosexual was a crime punishable by death. I doubt that Mary the Catholic queen was so ""with it"" that she would consider Rizzio, here portrayed as openly gay, just one of her gang of ladies in waiting.",/review/rw4926687/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2019,SnoopyStyle,6," are we sure?
","Mary (Saoirse Ronan) was raised in the French court. After the death of her first husband King Francis II of France, the 19 year old Scot monarch returns to her homeland to take back the throne from her Protestant half-brother. She faces opposition from her Protestant subjects under constant attack by cleric John Knox and a rival in her cousin Queen Elizabeth I (Margot Robbie). Her lineage gives her a better claim to both crowns. Elizabeth is in love with Robert Dudley but she is blocked from marrying the commoner. Mary marries Henry Stuart, an English Catholic lord, and faces rebellion from her many foes including her own husband.",/review/rw4926687/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2019,Minnesota_Reid,6," Disappointment
","I really wanted to love this movie. It was beautifully shot, and Ronin was, as always, very strong. And the rest of the cast was fine -- the problems with this Elizabeth were not Robbie's fault. The film was beautiful, but quite, quite dead. And it didn't flow, just a bunch of independent set pieces. Blame the writer and the director.",/review/rw4926687/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2022,a.lampert,6," Woke telling of history
","Director Josie Rourke appears to want to tell the historical story of Mary Queen of Scots and her cousin, Queen Elizabeth the first, as she would have liked it to be, shown in fashionable 21st century terms, not how it was in the 16th Century. I read that Josie was determined to have a mixed race cast and I ask the reader, why? The events took place at a time when not too many non white people inhabited England, let alone took their place as royal courtiers. This is clearly nonsense and I found some of the casting a distraction that spoilt an otherwise fairly decent film, other than an event at the close that brings the two women together in an unconvincing tearful meeting. I say unconvincing, not just because these two strong women would have been unlikely to act like two blubbering soap actresses but that there is no evidence that they ever met. Having said that, most of the rest of the film is fairly accurate that I can see, the rivalry between Mary and Elizabeth, a slaughter of Mary's aide, the murder of her husband and Mary's ultimate beheading. These are all things that may be common knowledge to many so I'm not sure if they count as spoilers or not. Soairse Ronan is well cast as Mary although I'm not sure she is pretty enough as Mary has been described in history. The supporting actors on the whole, apart from some miscasting, are on the whole excellent, David Tennant, Ian Hart, Brendan Coyle and Martin Compson are all strong. The real standout for me is a chilling performance by a heavily made up Margot Robbie as Queen Elizabeth who out acts everyone else in the movie. Josie Rourke had the opportunity to make a really good movie here but has blown it by introducing these modern woke ideas already mentioned, not just by me but by others. I'd suggest she avoids the woke nonsense if she wants her films to make a decent profit and to be remembered in the future.",/review/rw4926687/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2018,schappe1,8," A powerful story about powerful women
","I'm shocked at all the negative reviews I see here. they seem to focus on the ahistorical meeting of the two queens and the use of black and Asian actors in some of the roles. The first is about dramatic license, something frequently used in historical movies, including the 1971 version of this story. Any competent dramatist is going to want his two antagonists to confront each other and I think it's forgivable. As to the second, I recall Kenneth Branagh did the same thing when he cast Denzel Washington in ""Much Ado About Nothing"" a generation ago, saying that black actors should be able to play Shakespearean roles besides just Othello. Josie Rourke, the director of this film, must have had the same idea.",/review/rw4926687/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2018,ferguson-6,7," strong women from the wrong era
","Greetings again from the darkness. The history of monarchs goes back more than a thousand years. These days we view British royalty as little more than telegenic subjects for gossip sites, though for hundreds of years, the crown carried real power. Of course, the system never made any logical sense. Why should a baby born to the ""right"" family be pre-ordained to rule the country? These birthrights even caused much confusion and debate ... and wars ... when there was uncertainty about which kid was the most important. And yes, kids is the proper term. Mary Stuart (Mary Queen of Scots), was six days old when her father King James V died, and she ascended to the throne (though the actual ruling was done by regents until she was older).",/review/rw4926687/?ref_=tt_urv

","There were no African nobles in the court of Elizabeth I of England in the 16th century. Having black actors play some of the parts in this movie makes as much sense as having women as generals in that era. If you are going to do a historical film, either stick to the facts of the time period or don't do the film.

","After so many adaptations, really good, this film says just nothing. Except costumes, landscapes and cinematography. It is not a sin. But the purpose of it seems reduced at political correctness and its basic virtue is to give a reasonable Elizabeth I by Margot Robbie and to propose Saoirse Ronan as Mary Stuart, after the brilliant Vanessa Redgrave.

","In the bonus track of the DVD of ""Mary Queen of Scots,"" the director and the production team discussed how they wanted to build to the climactic scene of the meeting of Queen Elizabeth I and her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots.

16 January 2019,razor323,6," The 1971 version was MUCH BETTER!
","Soarise Ronan is NO Vanessa Redgrave and Margot Robbie is NO Glenda Jackson. This is such a weak, denatured telling compared to the more glorious 1971 version; and yes, admittedly it was based on Maxwell Anderson's play. But it was precisely Anderson's language that gave the 1st go-around such dramatic fireworks. This one is a lame, telegrapher version that tailors the story to the camera; and similarly, panders to PC-ness by casting so many minorities in the Scot and English courts. REALLY? It is so distracting and a travesty on history and does a disservice to the paying movie-goer by feeding into that ""casting diversity"" BUT WHOLLY FALSE Representation, of historical fact. The hairdos of the 2 queens are quite silly and again, dressing all the men in BLACK and just giving color to the queens' costumes betrays such self-conscious techniques that they are all doing these FOR THE CAMERA, not in the interests of historical accuracy. Quite disappointing.",/review/rw4926687/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2019,ToneBalone60,6," Below average, absurdly revisionist, virtue signalling playhouse repertoire.
","This film could have been so much better if the writers has stuck to historical accuracy.
I wont repeat what other reviewers have commented on the politically correct box ticking in both casting and script, that were clearly aimed at the Hollywood Awards committees. (You can't get an Oscar or a Globe these days if you haven't covered the wickedness of the patriarchy, racism and gender issues to an acceptable degree for the California luvvies).
The other issue that bugs me is how people keep assuming that Mary & Elizabeth were sisters.
They were not, they were distant cousins. The confusion is that Queen Mary i of England, who was Elizabeth's sister and the other daughter of Henry Viii is a completely different character.
Even after seeing this film many audiences have still not understood the difference.
I've even seen tourists in Westminster Abbey comment on the fact that the Queen Mary i, buried alongside Elizabeth is Mary Queen of Scots. No No No.",/review/rw4926687/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2019,CubsandCulture,8," A little stilted but an engaging period piece
","The technical aspects of this film really make the film enjoyable. The cinematography especially is a crisp, soulful take on the chamber drama and a lot of time you get lost in the visuals. Likewise, the art direction-costumes are all top notch and in any case make for a splendid atmosphere. The direction brigs a lot of the script by being moody and really inventive in a few places.

","It is tough to make a real life movie about event that happened just a few years or decades ago. How is it to get it right with something that happened even longer ago? It is tough to say the least, especially if you try to be sensible about certain issues. That doesn't mean it holds back punches (or stabs for that matter). When it gets dark, it gets dark.

","Just saw this movie and it was so good; I didn't want it to end. While the story of Mary and Elizabeth has been made before; I was fascinated by this story because of the leads.
Saorsie Ronan and Margot Robbie are just terrific in the roles. The story moved along intercutting between the two queens. Ms. Ronan has the bigger role as Mary and is every inch the queen. Ms. Robbie as Elizabeth is very good, and becomes a hideous caricature of that queen as she ages. The machinations of the queens' courts and political intrigue that lead to Mary's end are fascinating. The costumes, makeup, cinematography and direction are all first rate.",/review/rw4926687/?ref_=tt_urv
