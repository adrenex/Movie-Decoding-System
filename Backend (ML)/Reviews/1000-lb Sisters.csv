","Trash TV but darn is it entertaining. It's TLC what more do you expect? But on a serious note, as sad as it is, this story of two morbidly obese sisters motivates me to eat healthier and stay active.",/review/rw5425198/?ref_=tt_urv

","Ah, yes, TLC. It used to be called The Learning Channel, but doing that now would make it guilty of fraudulent advertising. Anything feeding the mind was removed long ago in favor of tripe like this.",/review/rw5425198/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2020,SamUnfiltered1979,1," Horrid
","This is a show about the most obnoxious hateable sisters. I mean, they have no redeeming qualities. Their weight is the least of their issues. They don't want anything to do with healthy eating or exercise. They just want attention, pity and for everyone to do their work. The first episode the two of them ate enough for a army platoon by themselves. They sit and eat a bowl of spray redi whip then sit and belch on camera. They want to be lazy and people to fawn over them. What has happened to TLC?. This is garbage.",/review/rw5425198/?ref_=tt_urv

",The tension between these sisters is incredible. They need therapy and probably shouldn't be living together. They are constantly fighting over which one of them is more of a victim. I appreciate shows that show the struggle of weightloss and food addiction but this one is hard to watch. I wish them both the best.,/review/rw5425198/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's not as bad as people are saying.. Yes it is disgusting to watch, but it's motivating me to eat better myself so there are positive takeaways from it, I also weirdly find it entertaining..",/review/rw5425198/?ref_=tt_urv

","Other reviewers aren't even reviewing the show or episode by episode, they're just criticizing these women. I sat down and watched. They're spunky and silly but they do try their best, at least Amy did from start to finish. She actually accomplished so much and none of these reviews give her credit, they call her lazy but she DID IT! I found myself rooting for her and hoping the best. Tammy however dampened much of the show with her unwillingness and constant excuses. Please stop hating on them and realize that they're Trying.",/review/rw5425198/?ref_=tt_urv

","Watching this reality series is very sad. Several weeks ago watching television, I seen several commercials regarding 1,000 lb Sisters. I start to watch this reality show this morning at 2 a.m. On Demand on the TLC cable channel and I was horrified at the way these 2 sisters ate food and waking up eating food. I am surprised that they haven't died from a heart attack or some other medical condition. ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜­",/review/rw5425198/?ref_=tt_urv

15 August 2020,sb-487-173392,3," Really sad
","This is just another odd show of odd people airing all of their problems to the public.
To me this show about these sisters who are trying to lose weight is just exploitation. The show may be paying for their service and operations but to me it's just another sad example of TLC scraping the bottom of the barrel again with what I call for black of a better term freak shows.
TLC has shows about little girls doing pageants and they're hyped up drama. Then there are the shows with the little people and their hyped up drama.. And don't forget the people who are trying to find love in foreign countries and those families who have some religious proclivities in their church to have many many children.
All these people can do what they want it's not that I care about that I just think it's sad that they come on television and exploit the situations.
It would be wonderful to say shows with more intelligence less silly hyped up drama and just get rid of the trash TV.",/review/rw5425198/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2022,tessasmommom,1," Addictive trash TV
","This show is horrible, yet I find myself watching just to get my aggressions out by yelling at my tv. Tammy is disgusting, not only because she doesn't take responsibility for her situation, but, she refuses to let anyone help her and her family is taking the brunt of her abuse. Amy did what she had to do to get her life in order, while trying to help her ungrateful sister, and Tammy just keeps blaming everyone for her overeating. And, the two men she was ""involved"" with, were basically two men who didn't give a damn about her, but about getting some screen time. Yet, her stupid ass believes they love her and continus to stuff her face.",/review/rw5425198/?ref_=tt_urv

",This show is a perfect portrait of capitalism with no limits. These 2 sisters clearly have several mental issues that are never explored and treated. They need intensive therapy asap.,/review/rw5425198/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am so addicted and invested in this show! I just keep rooting for them to break the addiction and overcome to get healthy! It is very sad that they are unable to learn how to communicate well and care for each other. What makes me continue to watch is that I am hoping they achieve the weight loss they desire and become able to live a happy, healthy life.",/review/rw5425198/?ref_=tt_urv

","So this is what it's come to, watching 2 obese sisters literally eat themselves to death. P.T. Barnum would be so proud, yet here we are a little shy of two hundred years later, watching the freak show on digital cable TV. I can only imagine the remuneration they receive for shaming themselves publicly is quickly swallowed whole before ever reaching the local S & L. I can't imagine this show lasting very many seasons, let's just hope they are welcomed with open arms in Gibsonton, Florida when this is all over.",/review/rw5425198/?ref_=tt_urv

19 April 2021,office-71571,8," Empathy
","I feel a lot of empathy for them. As they don't know better. That is how they were raised. And I think it is very difficult when you have any type of addiction. But the family must put their foot down, support her and someone needs to find a facility so that she can be monitored and helped.",/review/rw5425198/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2020,MagicMurderFan,3," Pure boredom...
","I watched because during the pandemic, here we go watching trash tv. They are ignorant and mannerless. Can't completely blame them, their mother is a complete monster. The mother is an ignorant hillbilly and she's as big as they are, but she's mean to the girls, like she is so much better. So these girls have a good addiction, the bigger problem (no pun) is that they are selfish and lazy. These girls seem to have the mental capacity of 5 years olds. What's bothersome, is the one has a disability but instead of it providing her with purpose it just allows her to lie around and get fat. This show if anything puts light on, what's wrong with America's assistance programs. One of the girls wants a baby, but I would have to say that's her mentality, like a baby. They aren't toys. You don't take care of yourself, it's like giving a heroine addict a baby. This is just sad that human beings have been morphed into this mentally and physically.",/review/rw5425198/?ref_=tt_urv

","I don't think Tammy has much longer on this earth. She doesn't take losing weight serious enough. It's sad. She knows what the consequences are to her food addiction, doesn't she. Has anyone just come right out to her and say, listen, If you don't lose weight, you're going to die!? She needs to get off those dating sites and focus on saving her life. Because, in my opinion, it's no longer lose weight to look and feel better, hers is a life or death situation!",/review/rw5425198/?ref_=tt_urv

",I love how Amy Michael have really are living their lives with their son & new announcement of a new addition. Chris & his wife are sweet and I'm so happy for Chris in his weight loss. Tammy is the laziest liar manipulative person I've ever seen. She treats the people who are the best to her like trash. She's mean to others also. It has nothing to do with her weight her actions make her non appealing I see her use people & omg if she doesn't get her way calling the cops! On her family members wow. Her siblings have had it with her as has the dr. I'm glad Amy is doing for her family & she should aunt Tammy could get a visit occasionally but I would not leave any kid along with her.

",I've heard of the Slaton sisters from YouTube but recently started watching them from their TLC show. I usually don't write reviews on shows but I just had to write something about this one. I like how it has a comedy vibe to it and the sisters are both very likable. It's also a very feel good/inspirational show. I'm glad that this was put on TLC :),/review/rw5425198/?ref_=tt_urv
