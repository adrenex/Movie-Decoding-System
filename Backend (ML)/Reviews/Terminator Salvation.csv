20 July 2007,ackstasis,9," ""The script I'm starting, it's about flowers. No one's ever done a movie about flowers before.""
","After the phenomenal success of 'Being John Malkovich' in 1999, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman was commissioned to adapt Susan Orlean's non-fiction novel, ""The Orchid Thief,"" for the screen. However, it didn't take long for him to realise that Orlean's book was basically unfilmable, its sprawling and ponderous story lacking any clear structure or coherence. After some months of struggling vainly to write a screenplay from the novel, Kaufman's script inexplicably became the story of a writer's effort to adapt an unadaptable novel. Kaufman's completed script was presented to his financial backers with some trepidation, but they reportedly loved it so much that they decided to abandon the original project and film his screenplay. Spike Jonze, who had also directed ""Being John Malkovich,"" returned to direct ""Adaptation,"" the quirky, twisting, self-referential film that received almost universal critical acclaim. Much like Federico Fellini's classic 1963 film, '8½,' from which Kaufman almost certainly drew inspiration, 'Adaptation' tells the story of its own creation.",/review/rw3197496/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2005,MovieAddict2016,10," I get it now.
","The first time I saw ""Adaptation"" I expected something else and walked away severely disappointed. As some of you out there who Private Messaged me in regards to my initial review posted on IMDb might already be aware, I originally gave it a rating of 3.5/5 stars, back when I was frequently contributing to the site. I passed on without much thought, considering it a disappointment and leaving my critique for those who cared to read it.",/review/rw3197496/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've read many of the comments regarding Adaptation, and it seems as though most people have disliked this movie because of its ending. They make claims such as, ""Kaufman's script was great until the end,"" or, ""Why did Kaufman talk about not wanting to ""hollywoodize"" his script, and then do it in the end anyway?""",/review/rw3197496/?ref_=tt_urv

","While taking a break from studying for my calculus final (a brain-draining exercise to say the least), I sat down to write out this review on what was, no doubt about it, a brain-draining movie (in an offbeat but good way). Of course I expected this from `Adaptation', for last month, in every major magazine, it has been touted as a mind-twisting ride, which piqued my interest.",/review/rw3197496/?ref_=tt_urv

5 October 2003,bob the moo,," For me, it's uniqueness was both it's making and it's undoing
","Following his success as screenwriter for 'Being John Malcovich', Charlie Kaufman is given the job of adapting Susan Orlean's book 'The Orchid Thief' which she expanded from a piece in The New Yorker that she wrote on the obsessive orchid hunter John Laroche. While Charlie struggles to adapt the book into a workable film, his twin brother, Donald, writes a successful script around serial killers. The more Charlie struggles to get a story from the book the more the stories and his life start to intertwine.",/review/rw3197496/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2015,SnoopyStyle,8," Truly original
","Charlie Kaufman (Nicolas Cage) is a neurotic screenwriter on the set of his movie 'Being John Malkovich' in 1998. He is uncontrollably sweaty in a meeting with movie executive Valerie Thomas (Tilda Swinton) who wants him to adapt Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep)'s novel ""The Orchid Thief"". He wants to stay true to the book and not Hollywood it up. The book is the story of John Laroche (Chris Cooper) who takes rare orchids from the Florida State Parks in the everglades using his Seminole Indian workers. Charlie starts developing feelings for his friend Amelia Kavan (Cara Seymour). His twin brother Donald is an easy-going slacker who decides to start screen writing. Surprisingly, Donald's clichéd multiple-personality murder thriller is a big hit while he is really struggling with the flower book.",/review/rw3197496/?ref_=tt_urv

27 July 2003,continuo,9," Cage redeemed.
","A brilliant, original film, hilariously funny almost all the way through, which is why the end seems disjointed and a bit out of sync with the rest of the film...until you consider McKee's advice to Kaufman, the success of Donald's cliched script, and the pressure on Charlie Kaufman (in the film) to finish the script. So it suddenly becomes a thriller, there's drama added to a genuinely moving story and characters, and it seems to rush towards its ending unprepared. But that's the whole postmodern element of the film - is it deliberately bad and pat (like the Player - a much lesser film that doesn't stand up after repeated viewing)?",/review/rw3197496/?ref_=tt_urv

11 June 2003,TxMike,," Brought to you by the ""Being John Malkovich"" team.
","I like to watch movies without preparation, just see what unfolds, so I didn't read anything about ADAPTATION before I saw the DVD this week, except to know that it is highly rated and has good performances. I now wish I had known it was made by the same team that did BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, because that would have helped me ""get into"" this film's mood a bit earlier.  While I enjoyed it very much, I found it somewhat overall less satisfying that MALKOVICH, mainly because I enjoyed the novelty of the fantasy theme of that earlier movie. Still, as certainly the most completely self-referential film I have seen, a story about the screenwriter coming up with the film we are actually viewing, I liked everything but the developments in the final third of the movie.",/review/rw3197496/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2017,guedesnino,8," Subverting the rules for creating a roadmap, is often the very path of affirmation of such rules. For in the end everything is just a process of adaptation.
","The kaleidoscope of metalanguage presented in the film, are presented and used with mastery, either at the beginning of ""Adaptation"" which is linked to the term ""Being John Malkovich"", both directed by the distinguished Spike Jonze. Still on metalanguage, which is about an adaptation of a book to a cinematographic script, which is created simultaneously with the film itself, ie a film about itself, as a joyfully self-referential exercise of self-deconstruction. But it is also, more profoundly, a film about its own non-existence - a narrative that confronts both the impossibility and the desperate need to tell stories provokes our expectations of coherence, plausibility and fidelity to the reality lived.",/review/rw3197496/?ref_=tt_urv

But if being overly precious is not high on your list of movie flaws (there are so many others), this movie may appeal to you, as it did to me.

","Adaptation is kind of like a wonderful mixture of a Woody Allen movie and a Philip Roth novel. We're invited to laugh at the neurosis of an inadequate man, but at the same time the film plays with form, identity and the very nature of writing  there's a lot of stuff going on in the film, but Jonze and Kaufman walk the tightrope perfectly.",/review/rw3197496/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2005,gavin6942,10," If This Movie Were Any Better, God Himself Would Weep
","If anyone says that Nicolas Cage can't act, more often than not they're right. But this is one exception. Cage is not only convincing as one character, but two - so convincing that I found myself forgetting it was Cage and even forgetting the two characters shared one actor. Beyond that, the film is brilliant. It is a voyeuristic glance into the life of a voyeuristic yet solipsistic screenwriter. Based on a true story, it becomes hard to separate the fact from the fiction and ends up becoming something larger than life. There is nothing bad that can possibly be said about this movie. Chris Cooper also shines as the lovable, yet deplorable, John Laroche. Never before has a movie of this magnitude been filmed and never again are we likely to see anything close. My body is still tingling from the excitement felt from my head, through my lower intestine, and straight on to my toe-tips. Highest possible recommendation!",/review/rw3197496/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2004,Smells_Like_Cheese,1," Absolutley... BORING
","I'm sorry, but I have tried to watch this film twice. Both times I just wanted to quit with the movie. I read the back of the cover and all it says is ""GREAT PERFORMANCES!"". Etc, etc, etc. As much as I love Nicolas Cage, Meryl Streep, and Chris Cooper, their performances in the film, I have to say were pretty average. Not their best attempts. The only one that I'd have to say was the best was by Nicolas. He seemed like he was very into his character. But the movie, despite being only 2 hours, felt like it was 3. I just couldn't believe that anyone else couldn't find this movie to be boring. How it could be on the top 250. It's trying to be another ""American Beauty"", and it failed. Sorry to those who enjoyed the film, but I have to say it was horrible.",/review/rw3197496/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2015,lesleyharris30,10," Very Bizarre and Risky Film for Everyone Involved,
","Adaptation is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. This film is very unusual, the way it is laid out, the way we are introduced to and follow the main characters and even the reason it got made is weird (look it up on trivia). Charlie Kaufman was putting his entire career at risk when he wrote this script, as he was suppose to adapt a book in to a movie, but was struggling so much that he instead decided to write a script about him struggling to adapt a book in to a movie, and I think that is much better than how an actual Orchid Thief film would have turned out.",/review/rw3197496/?ref_=tt_urv
