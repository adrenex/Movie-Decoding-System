22 December 2001,Jakealope,8," Good for some laughs
","Before I saw this movie, I was turned off by all the negative reviews and the fact that it was a SNL spinoff. But I bought a used tape from my video store. Instead of war coverage and serious drama, this has become a ray of hope. Make no mistake, it ain't winning any Oscars. But the slapstick is funny, has great co-stars like Joe Don Baker and Chris Walken. It has a good plotline, a search for his family. It's a lot of laughs and fun for plebes at heart. Serious, deep people will be offended, but when we try to make humor serious and deep, we're in trouble.",/review/rw0728839/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2006,ccthemovieman-1,8," Ya Gotta Love 'Joe Dirt'
","For a typical low-brained Hollywood comedy of this era, it was a pretty nice film. Of course, few if any modern-day comedies are ""family fare"" and this one isn't either but the lead character is a gentle, harmless guy. David Spade is very entertaining as ""Joe Dirt,"" a down-and-out nice guy (but not exactly pure, either) who tells his tale of trying to find his parents to sleazy disc jockey ""Zander Kelly"" (Dennis Miller). Brittany Daniel is an attractive, likable female lead.",/review/rw0728839/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2003,Incubus_Reborn,," This movie is a garden...dig it!
","Joe Dirt is simply one of those underappreciated comedies. Having reacquainted myself with it recently (and repeatedly) after having not seen it in almost two years, I myself am beginning to realize that. Not only is it thoroughly funny, it is entertaining and fast paced. David Spade plays Joe Dirt, a kind, well meaning radio-station janitor with an unusual hairdo (mullet!) and extremely bad-luck. He shares his life-story with the listeners of the radio station, which mainly focuses around his never-ending search for his parents (who ditched him on a family trip to the Grand Canyon) and his unrecognized love for hometown hottie Brandy. Joe meets many unusual people along the way, has many misadventures, and as if you couldn't guess, sets himself up for many disgusting and painful situations. The humor is pretty low-brow, but who cares? The movie is funny and that's the bottom line. What I like about this movie is that I can just turn it on and let go. The movie is so well-made for a simple comedy. Spade wrote the script himself, and you can tell he took his time. Every event in the movie happens for a reason and alludes to something that will occur later down the road. Also, Joe Dirt is Spade's first likeable character. You actually feel for this doofus. Even though he looks like white-trash, he is still a good person. Which of course, leads to this movie's moral: Good things come to good people. Or as Joe would say ""Life's a garden, dig it!"" or ""You can't have 'no' in your heart!"" Christopher Walken has a hilarious bit as Dirt's co-janitor at an elementary school that has been placed in the witness protection program and Kid Rock plays Joe's bully perfectly (I love the part where he reads the note just like those guys in high school who couldn't read past 2nd grade reading level). But Spade is the real star here. Too bad this character/movie never took off. I seriously love this movie. It is consistently hilarious, has dozens of quoteable lines (stuff that you say to people in your daily routine) and has an overall feel good vibe to it. I don't know how anyone can trash this movie. For one thing, it's an Adam Sandler production, you know what type of humor you're in for. And secondly: The movie is called 'Joe Dirt!' There are no pretensions here, folks. I wish there were more movies like this out there. And although not everyone appreciates it, I am glad that I at least have this movie and can watch it a million times if I want to. Joe Dirt, you're my hero.",/review/rw0728839/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2007,horrorfilmx,," Surprise surprise
","I'm no huge fan of David Spade and I tend to find the whole ex-SNL-star feature film genre lame and unfunny, but I happened to catch JOE DIRT while flipping through the channels yesterday afternoon and was intrigued enough to watch. And oddly enough I stayed intrigued for the next 90 minutes. The humor was crude, but rarely so much so as to turn me off, and the cast was very good (sure Dennis Miller was obnoxious, but isn't that his shtick?) but what surprised me the most was how caught up in the story I became. Sure it's farcical and impossible to take seriously, but for some reason I couldn't turn it off --- I kept hanging in there to see what would happen next. Even the slightly lame-ass ending didn't ruin things for me. I'd have to say JOE DIRT beats the crap out of similar, more favorably received movies like TOMMY BOY (which I found simply unbearable). Give it a chance.",/review/rw0728839/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2019,UniqueParticle,10," One of the greatest movies ever made!
","I'm not even joking I have probably seen Joe Dirt 50 or more times and still love it! The soundtrack is so damn good and the lines through out especially by David Spade are so good! Beyond hilarious and so much fun! Who ever came up with this is awesome, I love anyone that doesn't mind Joe Dirt. Maybe I am weird, I do have ASD, although I don't like to admit that much. The scene making spoofed Silence of the Lambs is great. The enthusiasm is so heartwarming!!",/review/rw0728839/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2001,timelord-3,6," Surprisingly enjoyable
","I braced myself for yet another film with low grade humour, plenty of bodily function jokes and not enough plot to go around.",/review/rw0728839/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2003,TxMike,," ""I choked Linda Lovelace."" ","""Joe Dirt"" was a free rental from my local library and I was prepared, even anxious to totally dislike it, while passing a cold and rainy winter day inside.  While it is no masterpiece by any stretch, and uses jokes focused on every kind of possible emission of bodily gases, fluids, and solids, there is something about David Spade's earnest if simple portrayal of ""Joe Dirt"" that adds up to a rather fun and enjoyable film. Stir in pretty, sweet, and stacked Brittany Daniel as Brandy, Joe's unlikely best friend and future mate, and you have an enjoyable movie of almost no consequence. About the same lasting impression as watching an episode of Saturday Night Live on TV.",/review/rw0728839/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2001,billybrown41,," Funny as hell
","Yeah, this movie took a trashing from the critics, but what would you expect from a movie produced by Adam Sandler?  I had a blast.  Joe Dirt had a rocking soundtrack, I likeable lead character that you really want to beat up, a rockin' soundtrack, funny dialogue and situations, and the usual slew of Sandler humor; fart jokes, humping dogs, etc.",/review/rw0728839/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2011,theycallmebrandon,9," Better with age
","I just thought that it was amusing reading the reviews all the way from 2001 to the present. This movie received almost entirely negative reviews when it first came out, but now there is nothing but positive reviews.",/review/rw0728839/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2007,view_and_review,8," Joe Dirt: King of the mullets
","I just happened to catch this movie on television while visiting my dad. I wasn't watching for any other reason than it was on. I was quickly engrossed in the movie... it was hilarious. I know that some of the humor, if not all of the humor, was a bit juvenile and sophomoric, but I found it amazingly funny.",/review/rw0728839/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2012,Chase_Witherspoon,7," Joe Deertay rocks more than the kid
","Forgive the title and you should find a warm, funny film that concerns an unfortunate yokel with a permanent mullet hairstyle (Spade) working as a cleaner at a radio station when a prominent DJ (Miller) sees the opportunity to exploit his pathetic story for the ratings of his drive-time programme. But the sorrowful tale earns a cult following as Dirt re-acquaints with his first romance (Daniel) and encounters an assortment of weirdos as he seeks to discover the disappearance of his parents when he was a child.",/review/rw0728839/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2006,darkjezter,7," Forrest Gump meets Jeff Foxworthy.
","Despite the fact that this movie was trashed by critics, Joe Dirt still makes me laugh every time I watch it. If you've seen other movies made by Adam Sandler, then you should know what to expect: lots of low-brow humor and implausible situations. This movie definitely isn't for film snobs, but if you're just looking for a cheap laugh, Joe Dirt is definitely worth a rental.",/review/rw0728839/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2016,PredragReviews,7," Life's a garden,dig it!
","Joe Dirt is a classic white trash trailer dude, that gets lost at the Grand Canyon when he's a kid. He tells his story of where he is today. A janitor at a radio station. The station ends up broadcasting his story and it ends up getting the listeners interested and becomes famous. This story is very humorous and has a bit of a love story in it.",/review/rw0728839/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2001,jellyneckr,," 'Joe' is hilarious!
","As a young boy, Joe [David Spade] got seperated from his parents [Caroline Aaron and Fred Ward]. Ever since then he's spent his life on a journey to find them. On his journey he meets a nice girl named Brandy [Brittany Daniel], a Fireworks salesman named Kicking Wing [Adam Beach], and a friendly janitor named Clem [Christopher Walken]. David Spade is great in this hilarious adventure/comedy full of crude humor. It also has a fantastic soundtrack featuring classic songs from Blue Oyster Cult, Cheap Trick, The Doobie Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Eddie Money, Joe Walsh, and more!",/review/rw0728839/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2007,zardoz-13,8," ""Joe Dirt"" rises among the sod!
","Nice guys finish first in ""Joe Dirt."" This lowbrow, redneck, laugh fest grounds itself in the rude, crude, lewd, bowel movement-oriented gross-out gags of comedian Adam Sandler. Not surprisingly, Sandler's production company 'Happy Madison,' which also made ""Deuce Bigelow: Male Gigolo,"" produced ""Joe Dirt."" Predictably, ""Joe Dirt"" (*** out of ****) appeals to the mentality of an 8-year old in its fixation with all kinds of fecal matter, fart jokes , and big-breasted babes. Strictly speaking, guys more than gals will guffaw at the juvenile escapades of our eponymous character. Although scatological humor dominates this picaresque tale about our thirty something protagonist's search for the ungrateful parents who abandoned him at age 8 at the Grand Canyon, David Spade's sympathetic but half- witted hillbilly hero towers memorably above those lowest-common-denominator-jests. Aside from Dennis Miller's hilarious but obnoxious jeers at Joe's appearance and pedigree, ""Joe Dirt"" shuns mean-spirited melodramatics and contents itself with showing how our resilient hero bounces back from more hurts than anybody should have to endure.",/review/rw0728839/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2007,stephen-lalli,9," The Ish!!!
","I usually hold myself to a high movie standard. I usually would not consider a movie like Joe Dirt the ""cream of the crop."" But like many other times in my life I was wrong. Joe Dirt is a fantastic heart-felt flick staring David Spade as a pathetic white trash orphan in search of his parents. He meets many a folk along the way leaving an impression with them all. I saw this in the theater and thought, ""wow what a funny movie."" But then I caught in on Comedy Central a few years later and lo and behold I was hooked. Good plot, great humor, hot chicks, and even Kid Rock playing his white trash nemesis (it was a real stretch for him :P). If you see this movie for 10 bucks at Walmart or Blockbuster do yourself a favor and buy it. It will keep you company on even your darkest nights.",/review/rw0728839/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2007,Kdogownz,10," One of the best comedies I have ever seen...
","Joe Dirt, played perfectly by David Spade, has to be one of the best comedies I have seen in the last 20 years. While the plot may be far-fetched, the movie does stick to it and is set up perfectly.",/review/rw0728839/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2021,ThomasColquith,8," Better than expected

5 July 2015,ginocox-206-336968,8," Far better than expected
","""Joe Dirt"" offers a lot of laughs, which is the raison d'être of any comedy. And there are many different types of humor: sight gags, 1-2-3 punches, pratfalls, ridicule, absurdities, etc. Some of the humor is broad, raunchy, burlesque and low-brow, but other humor is fairly sophisticated. Some jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, while others are subtle. On a jokes per minute scale, the film ranks among the top. ",/review/rw0728839/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2007,WisdomSeed,7," A Nice Surprise
","I am not sure what was expected from this movie or why the people who did not like it did not like it, but it was a nice surprise of a movie for me. Occasionally some people get together and make an unexpectedly good movie and this was one of those time. With a good amount of humor and cuteness about it, and a surprisingly sympathetic performance from the normally acerbic David Spade it was a pretty nice waste of time, like Fifty First Dates was. There was some guttural humor (an atomic *stink*bomb), it was a well layered joke when you think about it, but it was (thankfully) no Farelley brothers piece of... well you know. It does not ask a lot of you and keeps you entertained. Joe Dirt is the lovable loser, on a mission to find out that home is where you make it (or to love homeboys naked).",/review/rw0728839/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2005,The Gryphon,7," Dumb, but Funny
","I kinda liked this movie. It's dumb, but it has some funny moments and a lot of heart. It's David Spade's first crack at playing a nice guy and it works pretty well. Joe Dirt is a guy who got abandoned in the Grand Canyon when he was 8 years old and he spends his life trying to find his parents and find out why they left him. It's a low-rent ""Forrest Gump"" type movie that has Dirt traveling the country, meeting odd characters, (including a great cameo by Christopher Walken as a member of the witness protection program,) and getting into and out of a variety of silly situations, such as finding a meteorite that turns out to be something a bit less celestial in origin. Nevertheless, Joe Dirt names the ""meteorite,"" drags it around with him and pledges undying loyalty to it. That gives you a taste of the humor in this movie - silly but sweet with the prerequisite poop and fart jokes for the younger crowd.",/review/rw0728839/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie was funny. I thought it was gonna be a dumb lame movie, but i was wrong. I give it 10/10. David Spade was funny and he always is. Kid Rock was good too. Though Jamie Presley was in the movie and they always have her play a ""whore"" character in the movie. I hope they start giving her better rolls in movies. Otherwise this movie was good.",/review/rw0728839/?ref_=tt_urv
