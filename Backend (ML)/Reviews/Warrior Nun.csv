3 December 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Very Entertaining!
","I have loved Tulsa King so far. I actually love everything Taylor Sheridan does so I knew this would be no different. This is fun crime show that knows exactly what it wants to be and you can tell the cast, led by Sylvester Stallone, are all having a blast making this. It's about a New York mafia boss named Dwight ""The General"" Manfredi (Stallone) who is released from prison after 25 years. He thinks he coming out to a hero's welcome but gets sent to Tulsa to run things instead. After not feeling the love from his gang like he feels he should he starts to build his own in Tulsa. Some of it may come off as a little silly but overall it's a really good show that's definitely worth watching. It's obviously doing well because it's already been renewed for a second season which is great news!",/review/rw8761101/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2022,Supermanfan-13,9," Stallone's best role in years!
","Sylvester Stallone absolutely kills it in Tulsa King! For Stallone to do a tv show you knew it had to be a good script and of course it would be with Taylor Sheridan as the created. Sheridan continues to hit home run after home run. He is the best thing going on tv right now with incredible shows like Yellowstone, 1883, Mayor of Kingstown, etc. And movies like Sicario, Hell or High Water and Wind River. Everything he touches turns to gold. Also, one of the other writers is Terence Winter who wrote shows like The Sopranos & Boardwalk Empire. I mean come on? There was no way this show was going to be bad with those two at the helm. It has everything you want in a good show...drama, violence, comedy, etc. Stallone plays a very likable tough guy to perfection.",/review/rw8761101/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2022,AfricanBro,," Just the start
","I watched this out of curiosity, no high expectations, I was just surprised to see Stallone in a tv series. You feel the tension in the scenes, it also feels fairly realistic as far as the plot would demand it. Wouldn't say it's humorous but a couple funny scenes as a result of Dwight (Stallone) coming out of 25yr prison sentence and not fully integrated into the way the world works now; so I'm assuming the abrupt transition will offer some interesting hiccups for him down the line for us. I'm glad someone told him how to use an Uber, it was funny while it lasted.",/review/rw8761101/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2022,yooniverse,9," Another Taylor Sheridan Hit
","I figured this would be an entertaining show. We've grown accustomed to think that anything with Stallone in it nowadays would be a comedy, and Tulsa King does feature good amount of humor. But Taylor Sheridan isn't going to create a simple parody of a mob story and using Stallone as a joke and punchline.",/review/rw8761101/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2022,jaimemedina-36288,9," Right on the money
",Exactly what you're looking. Tulsa King delivers. Stallone hits the mark with a brooding no nonsense performance that blends humor and violence to near perfection.,/review/rw8761101/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2022,geister_faust,8," Solid entertainer
","Likeable and relatively deep characters, plausible plot, tolerable pacing are the driving forces behind this show. Stallone is good being the main protagonist, but I like Andrea Savage and her character a lot, very nice performance. I respected a lot that Stallone is not trying to look younger when his character Dwight honestly mentions his age and how it could affect his relationships with younger woman.",/review/rw8761101/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2022,wrightinchicago-231-671840,9," It held my attention because of Stallone
","I don't think any other actor could have played this role. Sly is bigger than the small screen and he's given the best lines in this show. I only saw the 1st ep on YT, I don't have Paramount, but if there's more being released on YT I would definitely see it.",/review/rw8761101/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2022,pedja-the,8," Sly is back with a bang!
","Sylvester Stallone 's Rocky, old school, hard a$$ acting style fits this show perfectly. From narrating to cruising through Tulsa it just shows that this role is perfect for him. Also acting as a guy his age and style definitely helps to blend in perfectly. As for the show, the buil up in first two episode was great and moving pretty quickly. It will be interesting with coming towards the end of the season how good and how big twist they have prepared. In the meantime if you are Sly's fan you definitely have to give this show a chance, even if you're not, I would still recommend it for the sake of gangster shows.",/review/rw8761101/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2022,celt007,8," Eight for Now might be a 10
",I really like this show . It's a bit unbelievable but mostly entertaining . The humour Stallone brings to the character ( of the writers ) evens out the bits that are absurd.,/review/rw8761101/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2022,danielcereto,9," Sly at it's best
","The series is promising if you know what are you going to find from an actor like Stallone. The script is Ok, settings are great including real Tulsa locations and cast is acceptable.",/review/rw8761101/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2022,turdymac,9," I never make reviews but...
","I didn't know anything about this. I found out by accident. Look, I am a Stallone fan. Have been since Rocky, Rambo, Cobra. Even M. A. S. H. (1970...yeah I'm dated now). Stallone, in my eyes, deserves the upmost respect for his craft. When I was a kid he was a talking point for humor from my peers. Fast forward to today, this man has weathered the hollywierd storm. He has outlasted his peers and become something so much more. Ahnold? Willis? This man is a gem. Imagine, 75 and going strong. Great actor, good eye for a dying business and very, very good start to his first adventure into streaming tv. I take me hat off for you sir.",/review/rw8761101/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2022,phredator,9," Worth it
","I've watched the first three episodes and frankly after the first one I was hooked. This is interesting. I want to see what happens next. I see a man who was knocked down, picking himself back up. And although there is adversity along the way he seems to be making progress.",/review/rw8761101/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2022,collectorofsorts,7," Pretty Enjoyable Series!
","I didn't expect to like this when I watched the first episode last week because I'm not really a Stallone fan. Let's face it, his fame is from playing dumb angry guys and it's a different world we live in these days.",/review/rw8761101/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2022,JonanthanNewOrleans,9," Very pleasantly surprised !!
","Sylvester Stallone is officially back with a non pc action/comedy, he actually has great comic acting and Timing! This is for your old school action /comedy fan's. There won't be a massive intellectual storyline but as long as we get to see Stallone beat up some people I'm happy. Martin starr is also very good as the wimpy dispensary store owner, He's a very good actor and is underrated in the roles he takes on. I love watching the action stars of the 70/80/90s. It's great too see them keeping this genre alive with old school action and humour. You don't need them to dress up in skin tight uniforms and have magical powers to have a solid action movie/ tv show. This is a breath of fresh air and I hope they keep making programs like this and keep away from superhero stuff.",/review/rw8761101/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2022,dmach-61247,10," Awesome series!
","This is a really great show. It has the potential to be the next Sopranos or Breaking Bad. Hope they are not messing it up. Great build up in the first two episodes and a lot of comedic elements which work great. Exactly the show I was waiting for featuring Sly. Schwarzenegger should take a close look on how this kind of ""old man"" show can work and be so good. I waited years for King Conan to happen... and know it will never BUT Arnold, please!!! Bitte mach eine Serie, wie Sly! Eine Serie, wo Du den BÃ¶sen spielst und anderen eins aufs Dach gibst! Please Arnold make a series like Sly! It is never to late... and Silvester Stallone is showing it!",/review/rw8761101/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2022,spunkicub-09192,10," Sly's Still Got It
","Sylvester Stallone is a true icon. Wonderfully written with a mix of drama and comedy. Sly is right on point with his character, and his costars are really good too. Great storyline as well. Only have seen to 2 episodes, and I want more! Makes me proud to be Italian lol. If you thought Sly was great in movies, you are in for a treat, because he is even better in this television show! And he's 75? You wouldn't know it. If you are a Sylvester Stallone or mob movie fan, give this show a shot. I promise you that you will enjoy every minute of it, and like me be on the edge of your seat waiting for next week!",/review/rw8761101/?ref_=tt_urv

13 November 2022,b4blue,10," I watched out of curiosity
","I was pleasantly surprised. Main character is like a ripple in a water that was too calm for too long. At 76 it is pretty impressive he can still land a role like this. It is also very inspiring. Perhaps this story will remind everyone it is never too late to start all over, if you have what it takes. Everything else, like new tech, are just details. Main rules never change. It's all about hustling. Kinda like undercover billionaire reality show, but on the other side of the law. They should have a shark tank for business ideas for criminals. That would be a hit reality show :D. I can't wait to see how this story develops. I will definitely continue to watch.",/review/rw8761101/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm so excited for this series. I feel like the writing is superb, and Stallone was made for this role. He knocks it out of the park, I am a fan. This is very comical and it's awesome to see comedy in these types of shows. I laughed a ton.",/review/rw8761101/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2022,pagemaster7,9," Stallone should have played a mob capo sooner
","I've always liked Stallone, over the years, yes he's sequel addicted but has made some really enjoyable films scattering a few classics along the way. In Tulsa King could very well be his best work just from a acting perspective, he's just stone cold nailing the role of a mafia capo. The series itself has a interesting story, it's well written taking full advantage of the humor of a New York mobster in Tulsa Oklahoma without becoming silly at all, throw in a healthy dose of violence, good writing and dialogue, and a great cast of supporting actors and characters and they have a winner. Fun to watch, well worth a look.",/review/rw8761101/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2022,WordsworthStone,9," right now, taylor sheridan can do no wrong
","I feel like the pilot episode is hitting all the right beats you would expect from Taylor Sheridan. There's the ol' timer, recognizable face, stoic most times, charismatic when needed. They establish the premise of the show from the get go, even starting with some obvious tension. And then, thrust the audience straight into Tulsa, just like Dwight (Stallone). He definitely hits the ground running. He starts recruiting his band of quirky misfits and sets agency in the new environment. And the episode ends with an interesting twist to the call to adventure. *chef's kiss*",/review/rw8761101/?ref_=tt_urv
