30 April 2007,jzappa,10," One of the Most Brilliant Comedies I've Ever Seen
","Hot Fuzz satirizes American action films in a way that an American satire would not. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg don't simply spoof the plot threads and the car chases. They know the smaller details of Hollywood's formula, as they exemplify with its continuous references to the scene in Point Break where Keanu Reeves fires his gun into the sky in anger and the scene in Bad Boys II where Martin Lawrence, in a circling tracking shot, says, ""S*** just got real."" Not only do they tackle those less clear characteristics of Hollywood, they also perfectly portray people who talk about awesome scenes in action movies, hilariously by Nick Frost. The film is brilliantly in precise tune with the American mainstream action adventure.",/review/rw1871957/?ref_=tt_urv

19 May 2007,DICK STEEL,10," A Nutshell Review: Hot Fuzz
","I will say it out clear and upfront - I love this movie, and without a doubt, a definite contender for my movie of the year. By the filmmakers of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz has everything that makes great entertainment, laced with wry Brit wit, and while it contains plenty of references from their earlier movie, it never bores, and for cinephiles, you're in for one heck of a time identifying the countless of movie references within. If anything, I can't wait to get my hands on their earlier efforts in order not to shortchange myself in missing out on the gems by director Edgar Wright and collaborating writer Simon Pegg.",/review/rw1871957/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2007,chrichtonsworld,10," Even better than Shaun of the dead
","""Hot Fuzz"" is brilliant! People who like British humor will love this one! It is really funny! It manages to make fun of ridiculous plots used in action movies and at the same time entertain you with their own ridiculous plot which is quite thrilling! Even when you don't get the subtle humor there are more than enough visual jokes to be enjoyed! I thought it was a stroke of genius to use some serious actors like Edward Woodward,Stuart Wilson and Timothy Dalton! (Timothy Dalton was accused of playing a much too serious James Bond! Well,in ""Hot Fuzz"" he shows that he can be dangerously funny!) As a parody on action movies this movie succeeds where others have failed! I think the credit has to go to the whole team who made this and ""Shaun of the dead"" including the actors! It shows that they actually like the movies they make fun of! That is essential for the the jokes to work! I thought ""Hot Fuzz"" is hilarious and very entertaining! It certainly is one of the funniest movies at the moment! Go check it out!",/review/rw1871957/?ref_=tt_urv

","London Police Constable Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a try-hard. He's too good at his job making everybody else look bad. He gets promoted and transferred out into the country. He starts his new job by arresting his new partner Danny (Nick Frost), the son of chief inspector Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent). Sandford, Gloucestershire seems to be a sleepy little town until a series of murders occurs. Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton) owns the local supermarket.",/review/rw1871957/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2007,snow0r,9," Awesome
","Hot Fuzz is the story of Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), hardboiled super-cop. Intimidated by his arrest record, his cameo-appearance superior officers (Martin Freeman, Steven Coogan, and Bill Nighy) transfer him from the busy streets of London to the sleepy village of Sandford to keep him out of the way and balance the books, because, to be honest, he's making the rest of them look bad. A big cop in a small town, Angel sees murders and conspiracies where the cameo cast of cops and locals see accidents, but, with the help of his partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), it's not long before he discovers that not everything in Sandford is quite what it seems.",/review/rw1871957/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2007,baz_trinity,10," Yarrp!
","Hot Fuzz: The story tells us of an over-active 'policeman officer', Nicholas Angel (Played by the co-star of Shaun of the Dead, Simon Pegg) who is sent to work his duties out in the countryside, to avoid his use of excessive arrests. Suspicions arrive in the town however, as people start getting killed 'accidentally'. Coupled with his rather unprofessional partner Danny Butterman (Similiarily played by Shaun of the Dead star Nick Frost) they get themselves into suspicious circumstances Nicholas Angel fails to ignore.",/review/rw1871957/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2008,Chrysanthepop,," Funniest Fuzz Movie
","The incredibly talented team, Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, who gave us gems like 'Spaced' and 'Shaun of the Dead' are back with one of the funniest action movies 'Hot Fuzz'. Not only does it brilliantly spoof the American action copper films, it also satirizes the English country-life. There are numerous references to films like 'Point Break', 'Die Hard', 'Lethal Weapon' and 'Bad Boys II' and the conversations where they're brought up are hilarious. 'Hot Fuzz' isn't entirely spoof. It's very much got its own sense of humour and the jokes had me rolling on the floor laughing.",/review/rw1871957/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2019,petra_ste,8," Ever fired your gun in the air and yelled ""Aaaaaaah""?
","I confess my first reaction to Hot Fuzz was thinking it was droll but a little disappointing after the faster-paced, hilarious Shaun of the Dead. How wrong I was... now I believe this is the funniest Edgar Wright movie. The first act is slower than Shaun, yes, but the script is meticulously crafted, a comedic masterpiece of setups and payoffs.",/review/rw1871957/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2007,Gareth_Hacking,8," Caught by the Fuzz
","So here we have it, the eagerly awaited follow-up from the same team that brought us Shaun of the Dead. But whereas Shaun (hereafter shortened to SOTD) drew its inspiration primarily from zombie films (more specifically, George Romero's ""Dead"" films), Hot Fuzz throws its net a bit wider, taking in every buddy-buddy cop action film made in the last 20 odd years and combining it with a very British perspective. Think Midsummer Murder spliced with Bad Boys 2 and you should have the rough idea.",/review/rw1871957/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2007,dgraham-1,10," Most fun in a cinema since....forever
","Saw this last night at a special screening followed by a Q&A with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. I liked ""Shaun of the Dead"" but wasn't a huge fan but I liked what I'd heard about ""Hot Fuzz"". I still wasn't prepared to be quite as blown away by it as I was.",/review/rw1871957/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2009,TheLittleSongbird,8," A daring and enjoyable comedy starring Simon Pegg
","I will admit to you, the film does start off slowly, and the finale is very over the top. Plus the murders are unashamedly brutal. But Hot Fuzz is a hugely enjoyable, original and daring comedy. It is fast-paced fun from start to finish. And all this is helped by a sharply observed screenplay, next to flawless comic timing and a wonderful performance from Simon Pegg playing it straight as the over zealous cop. The supporting actors do just as brilliantly with Nick Frost the standout and Jim Broadbent brilliant as always. Paddy Cosidine and Rafe Spall are hilarious as the two Andys, and Timothy Dalton is a pleasant surprise as Simon Skinner, and steals every scene he's in.",/review/rw1871957/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2007,planktonrules,9," Far better than I expected
","When HOT FUZZ came out, I heard a lot of less than spectacular reviews and naturally thought that the movie wasn't up to the quality of SHAUN OF THE DEAD (which starred the same actors and director). This letdown after a blockbuster isn't uncommon (just ask singer Cris Cross or the group Boston) and I just assumed this was again the case. However, I was very, very wrong. Not only was HOT FUZZ a very good film, but I preferred it over SHAUN OF THE DEAD because it managed to make me laugh even more and I thoroughly enjoyed this clever film.",/review/rw1871957/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was lucky enough to see a preview of this film for free after I attended a random screening of Scorcese's the Departed.

4 May 2007,Polaris_DiB,9," How to make a real parody, not package pop culture regurgitation into commodity
","Genre parody is running rampant currently, probably because Hollywood is so out of ideas at this point that they've gone down to the level of making fun of their own crap with even more crap that basically every year we get another slew of pop culture regurgitation in the form of Genre Movie and kids films like Shrek, Happily N'Ever After, and Hoodwinked to make sure nothing worth seeing doesn't have its hilarious counterpart. That is why we need people like Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright.",/review/rw1871957/?ref_=tt_urv

","Simon Pegg is an outstanding member of the London Police Force. He is so good that he makes everyone else look bad, so they promote him to sergeant and exile him to a village in Gloucestershire, where the major problem is swans keep escaping. He is paired with beery, indolent Nick Frost, whose father, Jim Broadbent, is head of the station. Frost keeps asking him about the life of a supercop, derived from the movies, which annoys Pegg, no end. Pegg insists that his most important tools are his pencil and log book, can get through the endless paperwork in three cuts of the film editor's scissors, and gradually comes to believe that jovial supermarket owner Timothy Dalton has been killing off locals for reasons that are unclear.",/review/rw1871957/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Shaun of the Dead"" was probably one of the funniest (if not the best) British black comedy that had been released in 2004. With gritty violence that made you squirm, innocent humour (Nick Frost) with blaspheming insults that just made you laugh out loud, and the quick wit of Simon Pegg with some great fun and horror mixed together, ""Hot Fuzz"" had a huge task of competing with the sheer greatness, of which was ""Shaun of the Dead"".",/review/rw1871957/?ref_=tt_urv

6 October 2007,Coventry,10," Brilliant! It's got everything ...
","And I really do literally mean EVERYTHING you could possibly crave to find in a relaxing and genuinely entertaining cinema experience! ""Hot Fuzz"" brilliantly combines the wittiness & fast dialogs of a buddy cop movie, the excitement & spectacular stunts of a Hollywood summer blockbuster, the absurdity & convoluted plot twists of an Italian Giallo, the excessive gore and sickness of splatter-horror, the atmosphere & setting of a British comedy sitcom and the cast of a thousand. If all this isn't enough yet, ""Hot Fuzz"" refers to multiple great classics of the big screen (""Jaws"", ""The Wicker Man"", ""Straw Dogs"") and even pays tribute to styles and sub genres of the almost forgotten but once golden days of cinema (Spaghetti Westerns, Gialli). For those who were still suspecting ""Shaun of the Dead"", the previous scripting collaboration between Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, to be a fluke, ""Hot Fuzz"" will take the doubt away once and for all. These two British lads are creative and multi-talented movie freaks and they know exactly how the please a wide & versatile range of audiences. The less you know about the film's plot (particularly the main twist) the better, because it's even more amusing when it comes as a totally unexpected and deliciously grotesque surprise. Simon Pegg stars as London's super cop Nicholas Angel, but he's actually too good in comparison with the rest of the corps, and so his superiors shamelessly transfer him to the countryside community with the lowest crime-rate in the whole of England; Sandford. Nick's new colleagues aren't used to solving crimes at all and fill their days with hanging around the pubs, smoking cigarettes and making fun of his obsession with law enforcement. Even when several prominent Sandford inhabitants die in grisly ""accidents"", Nick can't seem to convince them to investigate the possibility of murder. The eventual truth behind the crimes is as demented as it is brilliant, and the last half hour of ""Hot Fuzz"" is a simply non-stop adrenalin-rushing, over-the-top comical, blood-spattered and wildly cheerful spitfire of action highlights. Technically speaking, ""Hot Fuzz"" is a masterpiece as well. The editing is genius, the cinematography is very imaginative and the film makes absolute brilliant use of the rural settings and all its typical characteristics and clichés. Of course, the film owes a large part of its massive impact to Simon Pegg's masterful performance. He's simply awesome and hugely charismatic, especially when depicting the obstinate and firm officer who knows every tiniest detail of the law enforcement book. Pegg's facial expressions (or lack of, for that matter) add even more comical genius to the already hysterical script. The supportive cast (pretty much an assembly of England's finest players) is amazing as well, and each and every one delivers flawless performances. I think Timothy Dalton hasn't had this much fun starring in a film since he completed his first scene wearing the James Bond outfit. ""Hot Fuzz"" is a unique experience all together. It features all the known genre clichés & stereotypes and narrates a seemingly derivative story, and yet, the elaboration is (or at least feels like) something entirely fresh and original. Comedy and violence can melt together in a movie perfectly, it simply requires a gifted team of cast and crew members. Highly recommended! Seriously, if you haven't watched ""Hot Fuzz"" yet, do it as fast as you can!",/review/rw1871957/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2008,hitchcockthelegend,10," Homage or parody, Hot Fuzz is the best of modern British comedy.
","Police Constable Nicholas Angel is the pride of the London Service, trouble is is that he is making everybody else look bad, so much so his superiors promote him to Sergeant in the sleepy village of Sandford, Gloucestershire.

10 May 2008,hnt_dnl,10," A fun-filled, hilarious, joyride of an action film
","HOT FUZZ is one the most entertaining film experiences that I've had in YEARS! This is probably the most enjoyable film I've seen since COLLATERAL. And it's a British film, most of which I find heavy-handed and boring! But not this one! It's actually extremely difficult to put this film into just one category: cop film, action, mystery, comedy, drama, parody, homage? It's actually all of these things and much more. As parody/homage, it definitely has elements of a lot of other 'old' action movies in it: LETHAL WEAPON, DIE HARD, BAD BOYS II (they constantly reference this film along with POINT BREAK), and guess what? There's also a big-time homage to A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS at the beginning of the film's spectacular climax! ",/review/rw1871957/?ref_=tt_urv
