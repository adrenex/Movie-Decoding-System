13 April 2018,nebk,4," Mediocrity In A Cell
",10x10 is a by the numbers (pun intended) mystery thriller starring Luke Evans and Kelly Reilly in principle roles as a kidnapper (Lewis) and his victim (Cathy). The movie starts of interestingly if unrealistically enough when Cathy is kidnapped in broad daylight in front of a shopping mall. From there onwards what ensues is supposed to be a cat and mouse game between the two with the kidnappers motive becoming explained as well as the fact that Cathy is not an innocent victim in the story. ,/review/rw6037859/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2018,sassy-14613,6," Really not that bad. Good acting, different story idea and a good bit of action
","Not sure what the terrible reviews are about. This deserves at minimum 5-6/10. It's unique, it's got some thrills and great fight scenes. Give it a try, guaranteed your entertained.",/review/rw6037859/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2018,hongm-45381,3," Just two stupid mistakes kill the entire movie
","Escape one time, hit the guy hard and doesn't finish him. Escape twice and she has the time to lock him into the 10x10 room and she doesn't. Last thing this 160 lbs woman is stronger than a 200+ man... shame.",/review/rw6037859/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2018,VioleTAK,2," Can't get over how extremely poor script was...

19 May 2018,burlesonjesse5,7," VIEWS ON FILM review of 10x 10
","10x 10 is an unrated, tersely compact thriller. As something about a man who confines a woman to a soundproof cell only to find out that she killed his wife, ""10"" has a torture porn setting without the actual torture porn. Granted, the film could've stretched its running time past a mere 87 minutes for added absorption. Plus, there's a cliched clip of the authorities showing up conveniently after the final confrontation goes down. Nevertheless, 10x 10 leaves you torn and nomadic on which gender to root for. It serves up its transient premise in creepy and effective fashion. ",/review/rw6037859/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2018,snakeye808,2," Deserves an Award For Most Absurd Characters
","First of all, I'm not a fan of people who say the actions of characters in movies are stupid or illogical, or that no one would actually behave in that way, because usually they are talking about a situation that they have never personally been in, and more importantly, all people react differently to situations so who are we to say how the characters should react.",/review/rw6037859/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2018,bricslove,7," Will have to disagree again. This is a believable movie.
","I should really thank the reviewers for lowering my expectations, and then myself for not caring about reviews or rather, for reading between their lines.",/review/rw6037859/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2018,larrys3,5," Some Plot Elements Are Just Head Shakingly Ridiculous
","We slowly learn why Robert Lewis (Luke Evans) has abducted a woman Cathy Noland (Kelly Reilly) from a LA Fitness parking lot, in broad daylight, and taken her to his home, only to be imprisoned in a sound proof 10x10 hidden room. As the movie progresses, many of the plot elements here are head shakingly ridiculous, which destroys much of the film's credibility, as I see it. It will all spiral down into a most wild, violent, and absurd finale.",/review/rw6037859/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2018,peterp-450-298716,4," A would-be thriller with a failing story.

26 July 2018,elenaphysics,1," This was the worst movie I have watched in my life
","Please do not watch this. This was so dumb. A man kidnaps a woman.
He closes in a cell. He asks her all the time 
What is your name?? What is your real name?
Anyway , we come to find out that this woman was a deranged angel of death who took the place of her dead sister and as a nurse she kept killing all the patients who had commited sins. But this could be interesting if we actually watched a movie of her actual action before.
Not to see her incarcerated and being asked the same question all the time.
The man knows that she was responsible for his wife death. He KNOWS that she is deranged and what does he do?? He allows her to move around his house wielding a knife at him. He feels safe because he has a gun but she actually cuts his with the knife all the time. I mean , in the end he kills her, after she has become a maniac with a gun. WHY DID NOT HE JUST SHOOT HER IN THE FACE AFTER SHE CONFESSED? This is not a story of someone who wanted to learn the truth and just let her go. He wanted all along to kill her. Why didn't he do it? Why did his risk his life and his daughter's life? And of course the poor nanny-cleaning lady who died because he was unable to kill the psycho. This movie was terrible. This is not a plot for even a tv series. NO .NEVER. They just put luke evans in the film so that they could project this movie in theatres",/review/rw6037859/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2019,silvermistvio,5," It's not that bad but it's not that good either. Just somewhere in between.
","A lot of people are saying that this film is bad. But as for me, it's kind of enjoyable. But I must admit that the plot is kind of simple and the whole film is kind of normal.",/review/rw6037859/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2018,hallbanks,5," Good Story, Poor Directing.
","This film had extreme potential after watching the trailer, but failed due to unrealistic (very unrealistic) aspects of the film. This is a film that keeps you questioning the characters behaviors, but that's all it does. There is no deep connection with any of the characters simply because the lack of backstory. Also, 80% of the movie is filmed in a house, which makes it extremely frustrating to watch. SPOILERS: First, the good. The characters were played well, the filming and lighting was strong, and there was a good (poorly developed) story. ",/review/rw6037859/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2018,maximovlE,10," So many haters!
","I've given this a 10 just to help outweigh all the low scores. Ok so it's clearly a low budget, there are a few scenes where you're screaming at the screen, why didn't she finish him off when she could? But hey, it's movie land, that's what happens, always. You want realism that why on earth do you watch movies?",/review/rw6037859/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2018,nogodnomasters,8," I've been watching you.
","Cathy Nolan (Kelly Reilly) a friendly woman who works at a flower shop, is abducted in an Atlanta parking lot and held captive in a padded room in a suburban home. We are given clues as to why Lewis (Luke Evans) kidnapped a woman who appears to be a stranger before it is explained.",/review/rw6037859/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2018,rudygerst,1," What a stupid movie with stupid characters
","The movie desperately wants us to believe that the kidnapper took months to prepare his rapture. Yet, he comes up with a plan that makes ZERO sense. Why the hell would he try to kidnap her in broad daylight in the middle of a public place?? Why not at night, when she closes her flower shop?? This idiot almost got caught, by the way. This... brillant mastermind plan could have been trashed within seconds.
Then, the girl takes over stupidity. On one occasion, she knocks out the guy. She could easily have locked him inside the room, but doesn't. She knocks him a second time (God, who is she? Captain America?), then she DOESN'T take the gun that lies near the unconscious kidnapper. What the hell, girl???
The ""secret"" between them is not interesting at all. The movie makes us root for the girl, then the guy, then the girl again, then the guy again... It's fine, but the plot is so stupid and boring that I just couldn't care.
This movie looks like a cinema semester final project, filmed by amateur students with no budget. How the hell did Luke Evans get here?",/review/rw6037859/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2018,d.rust,," Hey, we got some money to waste, LET'S MAKE A MOVIE!
","SPOILER: Really, the title says it all. 10x10 is 0x0. I watched it until just after the housekeeper arrives and I switched it off in favour of watching a MARRIED WITH CHILDREN re-run. MWC was far more realistic and far more entertaining. I switched it back on just in time to see the ending, from the part where Lewis is stopped by the cops. Sigh. What a crapfest.",/review/rw6037859/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2020,robertemerald,8," Well written psychological thriller
","I was worried writing a review for this because I thought anything I said would give the plot away. I needn't of worried, as the blurb given here at IMDb is pretty revealing. 10x10 is a well written thriller, with an exquisite script, and refreshingly, is not all a two person conversation. It was extremely well acted. I found it really enjoyable.",/review/rw6037859/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2018,lavatch,7," Clever Cat-and-Mouse Game
","The strengths of ""10 X 10"" were in the two well developed characters, the ebb-and-flow of the action, the psychodrama, and the excellent performances.",/review/rw6037859/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2018,Wizard-8,3," Not dull, but hard to swallow thriller
","I think that had the screenplay for ""10 X 10"" had been given to several random people before filming started to get their opinions of it, those people would have most likely pointed out most (if not all) of the plot holes and illogical character actions. Then after a few rewrites to patch up those script weaknesses, we might very well have had a decent low budget thriller. As you have probably guessed by the first two sentences of this user review, this movie has more than its share of problems. I admit it's well produced on what had to be a very low budget, it's decently acted, and I was never bored at any minute of the movie. And the movie does start off well (if in a little familiar sense), getting you wondering what's going on and why. Unfortunately, after a time those aforementioned problems start coming up one by one. The two lead characters make some really stupid and unbelievable decisions on the fly (such as not beating their opponent to a pulp when they have the chance, or hastily picking up weapons when they have a chance), and the lead male character clearly didn't properly plan his big scheme very well. (He somehow forgot his daughter would come home later in the day while he was executing his plan?!?!) Despite a few good things to be found in the movie, more likely than not you'll be unsatisfied and frustrated before the end credits start rolling.",/review/rw6037859/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2018,donttouchmeprimate,1," What I liked and disliked.
","You've already seen this movie a hundred times before. So, straight to it. Both main cast members here are far much better than this movie could ever be, which makes me think that they just took this job for the money. We all know who Luke Evans is by now and Kelly Reilly is a pretty well, known lady also.",/review/rw6037859/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2018,toddxdavis,2," Someone took a film course on-line and thought they could produce a movie
","At no moment was there a compelling reason to continue watching this folm so I wen to IMDb to see what others thought about it and just had to finish the movie to see if the bad reviews were accurate.
They are. 
This movie makes you cheer for the lady who never had to use a bathroom the entire time she was held in the small room.
It made me want to cheer for the lady because she showed considerably more passion in her role. ",/review/rw6037859/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2018,Q8-MarronGlace,6," Surprisingly it wasn't as bad as people wrote about it

25 November 2019,bramstayer,2," Guys hands magically become frozen ....Give it a miss
","Big Problems with this reverse victim style thing. The mystery went on too long &....the barrage of questions went on forever.. it WAS potentially setting us up for a good revenge story but nope!
Even the answers to the questions asked 3txs just arent interesting ENOUGH. I WON'T bother too much but I liked the male lead and gave it a look. Waste of his talent. And there were times ( & I mean many) where the woman captive once freed, was hitting him while his bigger stronger hands attached to longer stronger uninjured arms were just frozen at his side! I meam c'mon now!
If you are gonna make the action more important than the story it should be at least better than that! (The ending didnt happen either.) Cheap movie like fast food...ALSO boring. Forgettable a day later.",/review/rw6037859/?ref_=tt_urv
