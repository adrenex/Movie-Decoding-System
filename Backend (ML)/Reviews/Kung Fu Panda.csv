4 November 2022,martinmatt-81974,10," I swear to God this is the movie of the year
","I just finished watching and I am actually blown away. Having it written as a parody is just absolutely genius. This is hands down the best biopic I have ever seen. Not only is this my favorite film of the year, it might now be one of my top favorite films of all time. And the ending is definitely one of my favorite endings of all time. I literally laughed through the entire credits. Even though the film was a parody in a way, the actors still did a fantastic job. Daniel killed it and deserves an award. I thought Evan Rachel Wood was amazing as Madonna. Rainn Wilson was hilarious as Dr. Demento. Love you and thank you Weird Al! Keep being weird everyone!",/review/rw8654310/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2022,charles-boecher,9," Love ""Weird Al""
","I used to love Weird Al, and would buy all his tapes when they came out. He has a childish inventiveness that even though often aggravating, is a wonderful thing.",/review/rw8654310/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,Sylviastel,10," Mr Yankovic, We found Your Son at a Polka Party with an Accordion
",Daniel Radcliffe is brilliant in Weird Al Yankovic's parody of biographical films. It's a fictional account of his life. It gets absurd at times but it is supposed to be. There is a lot of fiction here. It's really a comedy.,/review/rw8654310/?ref_=tt_urv

10 November 2022,CANpatbuck3664,8," Daniel Radcliffe and Evan Rachel Wood Shine in a Uniquely ""Weird"" Parody/Biopic
","I hope few people walk into this thinking it's a serious biopic, you'll be in for quite the surprise. Although Weird starts in a conventional manner, you'll realize that a devotion to reality wasn't the primary goal of the film. It's a parody of the music biopic genre, think Walk Hard instead of Walk the Line or Ray. But the tone and vibe is a little different. Instead of winking at the audience or pausing for laughter, the cast and the crew play it completely straight as if the material was factual. This is an admirable choice, it allows you to pick up on a few jokes that are specifically making fun of movies like this. It reminded me a little of the Naked Gun movies, it fires off gags continually and Weird isn't worried about you catching every single one of them. Weird bounces from scene to scene and you're either going to cruise right along with it or get left in the dust.",/review/rw8654310/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,spongeman_487,9," The Spoof Comedy We Deserve
","An absolute riot of hilarious spoof & parody comedy about ""Weird"" Al Yankovic's 100% true exciting and wildly outrageous life story. Daniel Radcliffe transcends into Al and guides us through this heart wrenching insane, delightful story. This film is full of amazing performances from all cast and is packed with fun, surprising cameos. It's been a while since a parody spoof comedy that was this well crafted, and this one delivers. Eric Appel & Al Yankovic wrote one heck of a script that does not miss a beat, each scene carrying into the next and surprising the audience each step of the way. This film, in my opinion, deserves some kind of a theatrical run. It's way too much fun with a crowd.",/review/rw8654310/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,thesar-2,8," Tonight! On a Very, Very Special UHF Exclusive...
","As much as I LOOOOVE Weird Al, I actually didn't want to see this. It looked like yet another bloated, mostly false and overly melodramatic rise/fall music band movie. I was dead wrong. This is now my official/unofficial favorite rock band movie.",/review/rw8654310/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,EUyeshima,7," Reimagined Biopic by a Master Parodist
","For those expecting an honest biopic of 'Weird Al' Yankovic, get serious. This 2022 comedy was a pretty silly, sporadically hilarious reinvention of his life and career reimagined by the subject himself. He has a minor role as a record executive here (one of the Scotti brothers), while Daniel Radcliffe liberates himself credibly as 'Weird Al' after showing off surprising comic chops in ""The Lost City"" earlier this year. Along with moments of gratuitous, comic book violence, there's a staggering number of celebrity cameos stuffed into this free-wheeling parody of the master parodist, though Evan Rachel Wood has significant screen time playing a believably narcissistic Madonna. Funny stuff but for a selective audience.",/review/rw8654310/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,masonsaul,9," Incredible parody
","Weird: The Al Yankovic Story is a beautiful celebration of all things weird that stays true to its subjects personality with a hilarious lampooning of the standard biopic formula, filled with really funny inaccuracy and plenty of delightful surprises.",/review/rw8654310/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2022,parksiet,8," A hilarious surprise!
","No two movies have surprised me more this year than ""Everything Everywhere"" and now: ""Weird""! It's absolutely bonkers, a movie that only Weird Al could have made. This is the parody to end all parodies; it spoofs biopics/music industry and incredibly turns everything upside down by the end, operating by its own rules. It's insanely funny and one of the biggest comedy surprises of the year, and has fantastic use of setups and payoffs with its jokes! My only problem is in the 2nd half it really starts to feel like a sequence of funny or die sketches rather than a movie. But that's okay... it's supposed to be absolutely nuts! Daniel Radcliffe is awesome in role, and I loved all the cameos hidden throughout! Highly recommend checking this out if you can... it's impossible to find though unless you have a Roku... or as Weird Al himself suggested.. pirate it. So good luck trying to watch it, but if you do, you're in for a treat!",/review/rw8654310/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2022,flipschultz,10," if you know what you're about to watch, you will LOVE this!!
","I have loved Weird Al, since I was a kid, and that love hasn't died. He has been called the ""Court jester of rock 'n roll"" and that title is well deserved. And this movie extends that title to film as well.",/review/rw8654310/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2022,breeze47,10," Perfect parody.
",This is the perfect parody biography for a guy who has taken the piss out of everything for so long. So why not parody biography movies while he's at it?,/review/rw8654310/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,MajBlade2,9," Just give him the Oscar right now

8 November 2022,etann-36707,5," Was liking it but it got too far off the deep end halfway through.
","There is weird and then there is too weird, there is silly and there is dumb. This move had a bit too much dumb for me and went beyond dumb too many times. It's entertainment but I've just barely got past halfway and the feeling of turning it off started to creep in. I've gotten 3/4 the way through and can just shut if off and not finish it. The first 30 minutes or so were pretty good, I was having no problem watching it and it was enjoyable for the most part and soon after it rapidly began to degrade. It is Weird Al after all, so I shouldn't have expected it to be any less than what was delivered here, but it would have been fine as a more genuine story of his life than to make it so absurd, it went from a mildly believable telling of his story to just outrageous goofball nonsense. If the story was that A. L. F. Was Weird Al and Punky Brewster's love-child it wouldn't have been any less strange than the story that was told here and might have been just as entertaining. There were a few laughs here and there, but it went from hope to nope for me rather fast. I just don't know if I can bring myself to finish the last bit of it, I just don't really care how they decide to finish this story, it really doesn't matter, it's just so dumb and unbelievable they could have written anything and it doesn't matter to me.",/review/rw8654310/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,Top_Dawg_Critic,5," Overhyped and overrated nonsense.
","I get it's a parody, but viewers need to be able to compare what's real and what's a parody, so unless you're a hard-core fan of Al, this will seem like a bunch of nonsense, as it did to me. It felt more like a bunch of SNL skits stitched together to make a movie. I enjoyed his music, and know he had a proper upbringing, so I'm not sure what all the hype for this film is about, aside it being a parody, but not a good one at that. Why have this entire Madonna relationship when it wasn't true, etc. It had a few funny moments, but otherwise the story is basically an underwhelming sloth. It's trying to be funny, it's not, but achieves having hardly any substance to fill in its long and dragged out 108 min runtime. I'm a fan of Al's music, but not this film.",/review/rw8654310/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,paul_haakonsen,4," Sure, why not?...
","Right, well this wasn't exactly a movie that I was harboring any particular high expectations for, but still I opted to watch it, as I had the opportunity to do so.",/review/rw8654310/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2022,sad_otter,8," ""I really like Weird Al but I thought this was going to be serious...""
","Really? REALLY? I don't see how those two statements could possibly coexist. ""I wanted Weird Al's real story."" Okay, go look on Wikipedia I guess? Eh, just kidding. I can totally relate: I took my 4yr old to see Silence of the Lambs and that one didn't fit up to my totally bizarre expectations either, so I gave it a 1/10 review too (I kinda hope someone actually checks). I grew up in the 80's. I loved Weird Al. If this has been a serious movie now THAT would've been weird. I trip out we're all on the same planet with the same physics and everything sometimes. Crazy life all works out as well as it does all things considered. Enjoy.",/review/rw8654310/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2022,existing-30526,10," One of the best uses of satire/cringe humour
","Cringe humour doesn't mean that the movie is bad or something. Sometimes (like it is the case with Watamote and some monty python skits) it can also mean a humour meant to make a fun of a a certain subject, whether it is the character or a television/film trope",/review/rw8654310/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2022,vchimpanzee,," Golden Globes for Radcliffe and everyone!
","I was expecting the real story of this master of parody, but of course we can't have that. It took until about halfway through for me to realize this was nothing more than a parody of biographies of celebrities. True, a few details early in the movie may have been close to accurate. But about halfway through, imagine that Al decided to write original songs instead of parodies. So we go from the details of Al's life being changed like Al changed lyrics, to a completely fictional story.",/review/rw8654310/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2022,planktonrules,9," Exactly as I remembered it...every word.
","A few weeks before ""Weird: The Al Yankovic Story"" debuted, I watched a panel discussing it at Comic Con New York. What they showed was very funny...so I just had to see it when it debuted on the Roku Channel...and it didn't disappoint.",/review/rw8654310/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2022,cricketbat,9," Completely ridiculous...and I absolutely loved it
","Weird: The Al Yankovic Story is completely ridiculous...and I absolutely loved it. I honestly haven't laughed at a movie this much in a long time. If you're familiar with Weird Al's life, then this movie will definitely tickle your funny bone. If you're not, then just know that this documentary is 100% accurate. Daniel Radcliffe is giving this role his all and swinging for the fences with the deadpan humor, and it works. I also found all the references and Easter eggs highly amusing. I couldn't stop smirking the entire time. I know not everyone is a fan of ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, but they should be.",/review/rw8654310/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2022,digdog-785-717538,6," oh wow NOT good

5 November 2022,helenahandbasket-93734,1," What A Waste
","I understand the premise behind the concept, but the parodying of Al's life story was just painful to endure- we made it through 60 minutes just hoping it might get better, or funny, or interesting, but it never came close to touching any of these things.",/review/rw8654310/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2022,deconvertedman,10," An epic that will change your life forever.
","Weird The Al Yankovic Story (2022) is the true cannon story of Al's life, a wild ride though the ups and downs of being almost the best accordion player of all time and the number one in a very limited catagory. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll laugh and cry and maybe hicup just a bit and then you'll feel a way you have never felt before a strange feeling, as if an existential dread was about to be revealed to you, but you found the way to seal the gate just in time with that elder sign that your estranged half uncle gave to you in the back-ally on the night of the 27th, and it was quite lucky that the camera was on because it cleared you of that murder conviction! Anyway, so its a pretty great movie I rate it 5 out of 27 twinkey weener sandwichs's.",/review/rw8654310/?ref_=tt_urv
