14 March 2016,Ed-Shullivan,8," Escapism through film can be enjoyed through Adaline's longevity
","Mrs. Shullivan and I sat down to relax and watch a film that would allow us to escape the tragedies of the world events, U.S.A. political campaigning and the high cost of living. Our choice of film for this afternoon was the Age of Adaline. We were not disappointed. The fantasy/romance film Age of Adaline stars Blake Lively as Adaline who was perfect as the ageless 29 year old beauty who through what is described as a scientific phenomena combined with a horrific car accident survives what would otherwise have lead to her sudden death. Adaline realizes that she has miraculously been frozen in time at the age of 29 and through the forthcoming decades she will remain ageless to the point that her only child a daughter named Flemming, will continue to age to the point where daughter must introduce herself as Adaline's grandmother to the current love of her life in the 21st century.",/review/rw3261570/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you can have Harrison Ford in your movie and you just introduce him almost an hour into the movie and it still works: You know you have a winner. Generally speaking the actors involved are phenomenal. It's a joy to watch them. Even if some situations seem a bit sugar coated (not too much though) and there is the occasional clich√© in it, the science fiction element of it, still makes this very interesting.",/review/rw3261570/?ref_=tt_urv

24 April 2015,pamma09,9," Beautiful love story
","I have been looking forward to this film because of the story line. There are so many things to like about it - the flashbacks are well done and so believable. The costumes are so fun to watch. I do not think I have seen Blake Lively act before and I was clearly entranced by her performance. She carries the film so well and is so quiet and well done. I liked the actors - Michaeil Haisman is gorgeous and believable. Harrison Ford - so happy to see him in a movie again - and he is also believable as the father of Ellis. Elen Burnstyn is delightful. This story could have been presented in such a different manner - director Lee Toland Kreiger got it, and it is beautiful story-telling. I love the last scene.",/review/rw3261570/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2016,mark.waltz,7," Ageless is not evergreen.
","Whether living forever through magical waters, aging backwards, living life over and over again or being reincarnated and reunited with the love of your life, the whole idea of going against the natural order of nature and the way that God sets up our life is a scary concept. You are born, you learn about life, go through a variety of experiences, and then you age and die. To have anything beyond that always brings on consequences either tragic or painful, and how the human mind can't fathom surviving decades past all these losses just gives me chills.",/review/rw3261570/?ref_=tt_urv

28 April 2015,bethany-ellen-22,8," Surpassed Expectations
","Already drawn to the premise of this film, I had high expectations of it, and was particularly interested in seeing Blake Lively in the lead role as a 107 year old eternally young woman. From only seeing her work in Gossip Girl, which was adequate but not particularly memorable, I was keen to see what her acting range was like. Not only did Lively impress me, but the film did also, surpassing my expectations. ",/review/rw3261570/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2015,phd_travel,10," Romantic fantasy at its best
","Every generation needs a romantic love story that has an element of magical fantasy and a beautiful lead. In the 80s there was 'Somewhere in Time' and now there is 'the Age of Adaline' about a lovely woman in San Francisco who after an accident stops aging at 29. The story is well written enjoyable logical, complete and clear without being confusing or old fashioned. It's much better to see Blake Lively cast in the role of a romantic lead instead of the druggie or criminal roles she has been in on the big screen (The Town and Savages). This movie makes use of her special quality and loveliness that sets her apart from other actresses to full effect. Her love interest Huisman while not the most good looking actor out there, he has a kind face and they look right together. Harrison Ford is well cast as an older professor and father of the boyfriend. This is a role to which he is suited and doesn't look too old to handle like in some of his recent movies. His passion reminds one he can still act. Clever casting of an actor who looks and sounds like him to play his younger version. Ellen Burstyn plays her daughter and is quite amusing in her own way.

15 April 2015,Chalice_Of_Evil,8," All these years she's lived, but she's never had a life...
","The Age of Adaline isn't the first movie to tackle the subject of immortality, nor will it be the last, but what it does is offer something a bit different to your typical movie about immortals. For one thing, no vampires here. For another, while most of these types of films are seen through the eyes of a male character, it's a woman by the name of Adaline Bowman (her birth name, although she goes by many others) who is the focus this time around, which allows for a unique spin on things. Time and again we've heard from broody vampires and such how much of a ""curse"" immortality is, but here it's applied to what is essentially a real life scenario - albeit with one slight supernatural element. It poses the question that if you were just a regular human being, except you outlived everyone, what would your life be like? Here we see that it would be a life on the run, leaving everyone you know/may get to know behind for fear of them finding out your secret or becoming a specimen in experiments. You'd never be able to settle anywhere - which is exactly Adaline's dilemma. ",/review/rw3261570/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2015,TxMike,," This is a very nice and entertaining romantic fantasy. Ah, to be 29 forever!
","A romantic fantasy because what we witness, as far as modern science and medicine can tell us, is impossible. But some of my favorite movies over the years have an impossible theme. That's why I watch movies, to be fascinated and entertained.",/review/rw3261570/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2015,russellingreviews,7," Would you want to be forever young?
","No wise man ever wished to be younger."" Jonathan Swift  Walking into the cinema... Intrigueing is the word that comes to mind  with The Age of Adaline. It is hard to categorise this film. Is it  fantasy, a romance, a philosophical exercise, or a combination of them  all?   Overall rating: 3.5 stars Cinematic value: 3 stars Big Questions value:  4 stars  What would you do if you were to remain 29 years of age for the rest of  your life? Some might think that this would be ideal, while others  would consider this to be a horrifying experience. This is the life of  Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively). Through a series of fantastic phenomena,  she has remained as a 29 year old for eight decades. She has to  experience a life of solitude and separation, because she cannot age  with those that she is closest to in her life. Her life is veiled in  secrecy, until she meets Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman), a  philanthropist who ignites her passion for life and unknowingly he is a  link to her past. What seems to be an innocent weekend away, becomes a  crossroads for the truth and a chance for her to decide what she will  do with the rest of her life.   I will admit it, a good romance is a joy to experience. Romances may  not be my favourite genre, but they have their place in cinematic  history. The Age of Adeline will not win awards for groundbreaking film  making, but it does fill a void in this year's celluloid offerings. It  is a good, straight forward, romantic journey. Even with the fantasy  element of eternal youth, this was a good film for the romantic at  heart. It can get a bit sappy, but it is a satisfying tale. Indie  director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste and Jesse Forever) is able to  incorporate a level of geekiness to satisfy any male audience members  without sacrificing the primary storyline. His measured style develops  a believability of this inventive story. Kreiger hearkens back to the  beautiful romances of bygone eras, where subtlety and magnificent  cinematography aid in delivering a beautiful romance. With the same  level of measured performance, Blake Lively is excellent as the lead.  She portrays the melancholy of a woman who lives with the mind of an  elderly woman trapped in a perpetually young body. She allows herself  to fall for Ellis, who is an old soul in a young man's body. Huisman  brings a depth of character that makes this relationship right for both  of them. One of the challenges of decade jumping films is the ageing of  key characters, but Kreiger manages to make this element convincing.  From the excellent supporting performances from Harrison Ford and Ellen  Burstyn to the young actors that portrayed them in earlier decades,  these characters were convincing and do not cause any distraction.  Admittedly, the unfortunate component of watching this genre is the  anticipation of sappiness or the inevitable tragedy. The Age of Adaline  is a romance and contains some of these inevitable trappings, but due  to the melancholy of the lead character and the control she has to  shoulder for eight decades, this tale contains the bitter sweetness  needed to move beyond the syrupy elements of many good hearted  romances. Which leaves the verdict that Kreiger delivers an appealing  and enjoyable romance.   Before the opening sequence, this romantic adventure provides some of  the best discussion points in recent cinema. In our era of desired  eternal youth or the desire to merely appearing young, The Age of  Adaline allows the audience to see the curse that this gift can be on  anyone's life. It helps that Blake Lively is an attractive woman and  manages to not experience any disfiguring accidents in her one-hundred  and seven years. Which could cause a level of disbelief in the story,  but does not become a consideration. Her pain seems to come from being  attractive to most men, but she cannot allow herself to respond to  their advances and she is only is allowed to be close with her dog,  Reggie. Thoughts move from eternal youth to eternal life. Her  melancholic spirit is shown in her awareness of this life that she  remains trapped in. There has to be more as death occurs all around  her, but she seems to be eternally trapped. She maintains a mental  strength to not seek death as the answer to her pain, but death does  add to the shadow that envelops her life. If that is not enough,  Adaline has to lie and say farewell to all who come into her life. Her  life is a moral conundrum and explains why she seems to be a shell of a  woman throughout much of the film, until she is eventually allowed to  tell the truth and live the life she never thought she could live. The  Age of Adaline proves to be more than a romance. It is a philosophical  journey packaged as this year's romance.   Leaving the cinema: Is it ironic that a film of ageless beauty would be  packaged in the film making style of yesteryear? This felt like a  romance from the past, but will meet modern audiences with a fresh view  on romance. This is a film that can bring out the romantic in anyone.  It may have a sappy element, but it is satisfying and may make the date  night dinner conversation deeper and more meaningful.  Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this  film? 1. Would you want to be forever young? (Ecclesiastes 12:1, 2  Timothy 2:22) 2. Is an eternal soul better off being in heaven than on  earth? (John 14:2, Philippians 3:20)  Written by Russell Matthews based on a five star rating system",/review/rw3261570/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie touched me personally at a number of levels, because I lived in San Francisco, ""the one that got away"" looked a lot like B.L. and my (very happy) marriage is like the one H.F. portrays. I found B.L. hauntingly beautiful, and this story a tapestry of feelings unfolding; especially her surrender versus flight. Her encounter with H.F. from out of her past is powerful for both characters. And I thought the resolution of her immortality was quite a pleasant surprise that made me smile after being teary-eyed most of the movie.

",". . . whether it comes at age 30 or age 108. In THE AGE OF ADALINE, ""Jenny"" gets hers during her 30th year (or tenth, depending upon how you count), while the title character's initial silver thread gets plucked out at five score and eight. ADALINE is a retelling of the Greek tragedy, Oedipus. Though all the elements of the original remain (a woman doing a father and son, a blind person, secret identities, astronomical abnormalities), a few of the trivial details are mixed around so that Euripides' estate cannot launch a plagiarism suit in the United States (which, thanks to copious Congressional bribe-taking from the Disney MegaCorp and Steamboat Willie, enjoys copyright laws which are due to be extended back to God and His Ten Commandments thing on July 1 of this year). Though ADALINE's story is as old as the hills, Blake Lively's trademark mole is mesmerizing enough to detract one's attention from the scientific-sounding malarkey spouted by the strangely omniscient voice-over guy at the beginning and the end of her tale.",/review/rw3261570/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2015,scottshak_111,7," A beautiful glimpse into eternity
","The Age of Adaline if not great, is a good movie that skims romance gorgeously. The concept though a mere fantasy is brought to life with a scientific outlook and a background narration that doesn't properly explore the how. The theme of the movie is romance and it tries to stay on it with Lee Toland Krieger's beautiful direction.

26 May 2015,troyputland,7," Different from the usual romance film...
","Lee Toland Kriger's The Age of Adaline is a superb romantic thanks to its lead duo. Blake Lively is Adaline, the fair immortal who hasn't aged for several decades due to a severe car crash. She goes from relationship to relationship, from town to town, never settling down. A risky chance comes in the form of Ellis (Huisman), a stylish man whose intellect almost matches Adaline's own. Their encounters are warm, humorous and touching. Great support comes from Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker as Ellis' parents. Nudges of surrealism make TAoA vary from the usual romantic stories. Its voice-over, telling Adaline's 'miraculous' tale, is its only downfall. The unknown storyteller attempts to justify Adaline's conditions, but it comes across as a magnificent coincidence instead.",/review/rw3261570/?ref_=tt_urv

","A lot of reviewers seem to have found some meaning, purpose, and message in the story. To me it flat lined right after the first auto accident and read like a low end novel.
