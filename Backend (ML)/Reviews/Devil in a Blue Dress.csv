6 February 2005,BrandtSponseller,7," Nowehere near as good as the original, but worth a viewing
","A remake of John Carpenter's superior film of the same title from 1976, Assault on Precinct 13 concerns a siege on a largely abandoned police station, which is related to the presence of a notorious criminal, Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne). It's left up to a ragtag group of police employees and criminals to defend themselves.",/review/rw1079711/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2005,Coventry,7," Good remake, but no competition for Carpenter.
","When they first announced there was a remake of John Carpenter's ""Assault on Precinct 13"" in progress, my immediate reactions were a little something like: ""What?...Why?... This is blasphemy! ... This movie doesn't need to be remade!... etc etc"" John Carpenter's original definitely was a revolutionary cult film. It was shocking, disturbing and politically incorrect and they simply can't make movies like that anymore nowadays, no matter how cliché that sounds. Therefore it was impossible for this remake by Jean-François Richet (never heard of him) to improve over the 1976-version. The good news, however, is that Richet never really tries to steal Carpenter's thunder and he surely delivered the best possible movie he could. Assault '05 is an A-budgeted movie that often has the charm of a B-movie and hangs together by adorable clichés, stereotypes and very explicit violence. On new years eve 2004, moments before the transfer towards a brand new police precinct, the old and abandoned precinct 13 is besieged by a gang of heavily armed and well-trained police officers. The reason? Top-gangster Marion Bishop, who was arrested earlier that night, has too much knowledge regarding the corrupt cop Marcus Duvall and his unit. In order to save their own careers, they have to eliminate Bishop before dawn, but also the innocent cops and random people who're in the precinct, because they know too much too now. The film offers quite a lot of suspense, good acting performances (by an impressive cast) and hard-boiled action. The setting (Chicago during a severe blizzard) adds to the tension. John Carpenter's original (which was, in fact, already a sort of remake of ""Rio Bravo"") will always remain one of the coolest, groundbreaking action movies ever (if it were only for that brutal and hugely controversial ice cream-truck sequence alone), but this film is a neat tribute.",/review/rw1079711/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2005,krorie,6," Not as good as the originals, but still worthwhile for action fans
","This is a remake of a remake and yet still packs a punch. I've seen the original ""Rio Bravo"" several times, including when it first came out. It was masterfully done and was one of the Duke's best movies from the 1950's. I saw John Carpenter's ""Assault on Precinct 13"" when it first came out in 1976 and remember it as being one of Carpenter's best movies. Now we have another version with basically the same characters including the drunk, originally played by Dean Martin, who is tested by the struggle for survival and eventually passes with flying colors. When I first heard the Christmas music in the movie, it took me a moment to grasp the reason for the Dean Martin selection until I realized it was the producer's way of paying homage to the crooner's performance in ""Rio Bravo."" This would be more entertaining for those who have not seen the originals. This remake follows the originals to the point of spoiling some of the surprises intended. I won't go into detail on this since it would then spoil the surprises for those who have not seen the originals. The story is there; the action is there; and the entertainment is there, especially for those who are seeing it for the first time.",/review/rw1079711/?ref_=tt_urv

4 May 2005,croatiansensation29,," An exciting, violent action film!
","Now, before you criticize me, I have never seen the original John Carpenter version of this film. Being a huge fan, I really should see it, and after seeing this remake, I will definitely track down the original to see if it is as good as this film. I had a blast! ",/review/rw1079711/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2006,jotix100,7," The old police station
","John Carpenter's original ""Assault on Precinct 13"" was a film that should have been left alone. This remake, directed by Jean Francois Richet, is not without its merits, but in the end, it leaves us wishing it was better.",/review/rw1079711/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2006,mstomaso,7," Intense, wild, well-acted thriller - just a tad absurd
","Jean Richet's remake of the Carpenter thriller Assault on Precinct 13 is surprisingly entertaining. Assault on Precinct 13 (2005) loses the Carpenteresque weirdness and soundtrack, and tells the story of a remote, run-down police precinct under assault using more conventional cinematography and production. This is an achievement, but not because of the difficulty of following in the footsteps of Carpenter - because the film entertains without doing so, and because the narrative - just like all of Carpenter's films- manages to keep going without regard for the improbability of the plot. In other words, the Director kept a straight face and made the film entertaining enough to allow for a certain amount of suspended disbelief.",/review/rw1079711/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2014,SnoopyStyle,7," Good solid action thriller
","Sgt. Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke) is on desk duty 8 months after a botch undercover operation kills his close fellow officer. It's New Year's Eve and he's in charge of Detroit's precinct 13 which is suppose to be closed after midnight. Crime lord/cop killer Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne) has just been captured and is being transported to jail. However a huge snow storm redirects the transport to precinct 13. This attracts a large group of gunmen, and the skeleton staff must fend them off with help from the prisoners.",/review/rw1079711/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2008,michaeljharvey,4," Generic, uninspired interpretation of the original
","John Carpenter's 1976 original was a little cheesy and low-budget looking at times, but it was still a very well done film. It was short and to the point. Carpenter knew how to build psychological tension and his vision of a street gang attacking a police station was menacing. The original Precinct 13 also offered social commentary. It was made at a time when Americans were fleeing the inner city due to a proliferation of gang violence the police seemed powerless to control. The original Precinct 13 registered with the American public in much the same way as the Death Wish and Dirty Harry films.",/review/rw1079711/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2005,TheMovieMark,," This is a movie about Precinct 13. An assault on it ensues.
","Keeping watch over a rundown Police Precinct on an icy New Year's Eve night sure sounds simple enough. What could possibly go wrong? Welp, check your Action Movie Clichés Dictionary and you'll find the answer. Problems arise when a van transporting Laurence Fishburne and other hardened criminals to the city jail finds itself unable to traverse Detroit's icy streets. What are the viable options? I'll give you a clue - there is only one ... DING DING DING ... Take up residence at the nearby Precinct 13 for the night.",/review/rw1079711/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2005,dee.reid,6," Not a pleasant ""Assault"" but still watchable
","The story has appeared many times over the decades in increasingly violent and less stylistic forms. John Wayne was in two, the more famous of which was ""Rio Bravo"" (1959). A seasoned veteran has to command a few loose cannons in order to fend off an invasion. John Carpenter made the stylish and violent ""Assault on Precinct 13"" (1976) before his landmark horror ""Halloween"" (1978). Now we've arrived at this 2005 remake.",/review/rw1079711/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2010,Theo Robertson,5," Merely Okay If You Ignore The Gaps In Logic
",John Carpenter's original is a fondly remembered cult classic .. It's maybe not as good as you remember it to be . You disagree ? Welll watch it again and tell me if you think it contains any superb acting because many of the performances are painfully wooden . That said for a very low budget thriller that delivers the thrills it has few equals . It also contains one of the most memorable soundtracks of cinema so you can understand why when news leaked that it was going to be remade the feedback was very lukewarm and its performance at the box office had a very poor showing ,/review/rw1079711/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2005,FiendishDramaturgy,7," Loud and graphic but enjoyable recycling
","First off, the ""original"" other film critics keep referring to is actually a remake, itself. John Carpenter's ""Assault on Precinct 13"" is really a remake of an older western entitled simply, ""Rio Bravo."" So while everyone keeps whining about remakes, let it be known that they have always remade older works. Always. ",/review/rw1079711/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2005,Syrchek,6," A solid action thriller
",I haven't seen Carpenter's original version but the remake seems like a very solid modern action crime/thriller with an interesting cast. Ethan Hawke may never be recognized as a great young actor by the vast majority of moviegoers but in my opinion he hasn't made a serious flop in his career so far.,/review/rw1079711/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2007,info-11400,3," A nuisance
","Why remake the original ""Assault""? To my mind ""Assault"" was Carpenter's true masterpiece. It had all the elements good Carpenter movies contain. External threat on a small group of individuals. People taking the challenge because they are forced to do so. Isolation! Just remember, the guns in Carpenter's original made no sound, being thus a lot more threatening than conventional devices. And now this remake. Concentrating on ""main character I""s psychology and on his relation to main character II (the evil but honorable). The anonymous threat in the Carpenter movie replaced by a rather conventional conspiracy/corruption background. The ""remakers"" just didn't understand the main plot of the original. And thus produced something pretty ordinary.",/review/rw1079711/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2016,seymourblack-1,8," A Tense Fight To The Death
","This well-made siege-thriller features plenty of action, excitement and some interesting characters but it's also incredibly tense. The tension is created by the predicament that a small group of staff in a police precinct face when they come under attack from a far more powerful and well-armed group of assailants who are intent on killing them. The fact that the besieged staff can't contact anyone to get any help and are led by a psychologically-damaged station sergeant only makes matters worse. Furthermore, when they have to make some uncomfortable alliances and start to incur casualties, things get even more edgy.",/review/rw1079711/?ref_=tt_urv

","For the first five minutes or so this movie looks pretty good. A drug deal is going down, and then it goes bad when somebody makes the dealer as a cop!

19 January 2005,Quicksand,8," A Big Sexy Sportscar with a Dent in the Fender
","It seems ridiculous to say, but I liked this movie because you couldn't predict the order of deaths. That sounds like something a 15-year-old would write, but here it manages to apply: You can't base the order of deaths on the level of fame the actor has achieved, or what order the names appear in the credits. Nobody spouts any glib one-liners after a kill. Death comes fast and without mercy, albeit to a number of faceless Kevlar-clad dirty cops.",/review/rw1079711/?ref_=tt_urv

13 May 2005,=G=,5," Same old stuff
","""Assault on Precinct 13"" is an ordinary action/drama about a handful of cops, a couple of babes, and several criminals in a soon-to-be-defunct police station house on a dark and snowy New Year's eve who come under siege by a small army of bad guys who want to kill one of the prisoners to prevent him from testifying in court. On the inside of the of the besieged police station are a sergeant with issues (Hawk) and the high value prisoner (Fishburne) who team up to deal with the threat. On the outside is the equivalent of a SWAT team led by a ruthless killer (Byrne). As this obviously contrived tale unfolds it becomes increasingly apparent it is just more of the same Hollywood B-movie material with nothing new to offer. There is, however, enough action to make for a lukewarm couch potato watch as long as the brain is disengaged and expectations are kept low. (C+)",/review/rw1079711/?ref_=tt_urv
