7 October 2022,benjaminskylerhill,6," Well-directed and charming but narratively slight
","Well, color me surprised. I actually had a pretty good time with this lightweight musical romp.",/review/rw8736453/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,subxerogravity,7," That was actually good.
","All I can say is that I like it. I was expecting it to be dull going in, but I found myself entertained. It does not hurt that Lyle Lyle the Crocodile was a childhood favorite of mine (Well...favorite might be too much. I'm giving a lot of credit to it simply because it's a book I actually read).",/review/rw8736453/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2022,srdikano,5," A bit flat but charming
","Lyle is an absolutely adorable character. And Javier Bardem and Constance Wu deliver excellent performances. All in all, it was a moderately enjoyable affair.",/review/rw8736453/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2022,peanutclairebailey,8," Really Enjoyed It
","It's a kid's movie and my adult brain doesn't allow me to reason with why there is a talking crocodile living with people in a house (do I lack imagination). Having said that, I enjoyed it. My child (aged 5) enjoyed it. It was pleasant, heartwarming. I would recommend going to see it. Don't be fooled by The Greatest Showman writers producing the songs, it's unfortunately not a patch on that soundtrack.",/review/rw8736453/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2022,monberger,10," Fantastic sweet Crocodile Story!!!
","What a sweet and tender movie, great for children and the whole family. There was no profanity and mention of drugs or alcohol; very clean!!! Lyle was sweet and tender despite not talking except when singing with the voice of Shawn Mendes. Lyle's expressions were charming and expressive (grate animation). Javier Bardem was great, as always. Fun and touching musical numbers; please don't forget to take tissues with you as it has moments that will make you tear up a bit. Please, go to the theater and see it on the big screen, take your children they will love it as much as I did! I would love to see it again.",/review/rw8736453/?ref_=tt_urv

","It felt like it took a while to get going, I have to admit I don't know what I think about the casting, I didn't think the magician had a particularly good voice, then as for the croc, I didn't love his voice, like JLM who does so many perfectly I felt that mendes's voice was a bit whiny in places.",/review/rw8736453/?ref_=tt_urv

1 November 2022,antoniatejedabarros,10," A cute, sweet, gorgeous & entertaining movie / Javier is absolutely brilliant!
","Yesterday we went to the cinema to see Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile here in Spain (in original language, English, of course) and we had a great amazing magical time. Everybody (children and adults) clapped at the end. Javier Bardem is absolutely stunning, brilliant and funny as Hector P. Valenti. The special effects are great and the cinematography is gorgeous. Lyle & Loretta are super cute, the music is fantastic, and the movie is absolutely sweet. No guns, scary monsters, horrific cruel people or super fast flashes needed, only a story about friendship, love and family with real human beings (not superheroes) -and with a lovely singing crocodile that children & parents will adore. 10/10.",/review/rw8736453/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2022,mounishyalamarthi,10," Fabulous musical Croc movie!!
","Honestly, this was the cute movie I have watched after the most recent tom and jerry. Cute crocodile with an amazing Shawn Mendes voiceover/song over. Every character in the movie gave their peak performance. I saw lots of little kids enjoying the movie, they were dancing near the screen when they croc sings. Worth watching if you have kids below 3 years old. It's a complete and clean movie without any obscene. There are a few scenes, where you feel aww and a few scenes you feel sad. I am an adult, I still love these movies. I saw many families enjoying the movie with their little kids. Perfect family-watchable movie for Thanksgiving weekend. Don't watch it as a movie but watch it to enjoy yourself with your family.",/review/rw8736453/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2022,Blashma,7," An interesting movie that was unexpected
","The great feeling that comes from a children's movie. It's quite interesting that Javier Bardem plays such a funny and less serious character, I hope he gets more roles like this in the future, he also sings pretty well. Especially Shawn Mendes, whose voice suits Lyle so well that I can't even imagine.",/review/rw8736453/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2022,doppleganger19692,7," Just have some fun!
","Sure it's an offbeat premise and sure the plot lines are predictable, but sometimes you just want something entertaining to help forget the woes of the world. While it is certainly aimed at a younger audience, this 64-year old found the movie to be entertaining and very enjoyable - not to mention memorable (the music will live in your head for a while much like ""The Greatest Showman"" - same music writing team). As for the rest of our ""review crew"", our 7-year old and his class buddy loved it, our 12-year old liked it very much, while our 15-year old (who also loved ""The Greatest Showman"") wants to buy the soundtrack and the movie when it is released on DVD (yes, I firmly believe in physical purchases and not the ethereal streaming). My bride liked it too, so a solid ""thumbs up"" from us!",/review/rw8736453/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,derekrice-00312,7," It's mainly for kids, but was still good fun
","I'm in my mid-20s and I like Shawn Mendes' voice as Lyle. Having him in the film made it good to watch, but I thought it's plot could have been better. Some of the characters are not emphasized as much as I thought they would be and some of the music is a bit basic. Also, the conflict in the movie was not as climactic as I thought it was going to be in my opinion. Nevertheless, I do not think that watching the film was a total waste of time or money. It's important to keep in mind that this is a musical for kids and therefore the plot is going to be somewhat basic. If you're a Shawn Mendes fan and/or a parent who wants to take his/her kid to see a movie, it's worth a watch.",/review/rw8736453/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2022,yorkhouse-1,10," A clever, triple-digit, feel-good movie
","What's not to love about this film? Pure fun and great entertainment. Lots of unexpected twists and turns, and great acting. Winslow. Fegley is a refreshing new face in the world of cinema, and Constance Wu is wonderful as his worried mother. But whenever Javier Barden's in a scene, he explodes with life and energizes the entire story. Who knew he was a triple threat - dancing, singing, while portraying a great lovable rascal in this movie? This is as as good as The Greatest Showman, with the addition of a singing, dancing, but otherwise shy crocodile whose love language is. . . Food! If you missed this on the big screen, you missed seeing a classic in the making. I don't understand why the Box Office is so low, even though the film's been out for three weeks, as I write this. All I can guess is that Sony didn't market t as well as they should, so most folks thought, ""Well, I've read the book, so why see the movie? WRONG!"" Do yourself a favor and watch this film with people you love. It will leave you feeling free and wonderful. And make you want to celebrate for the rest of the day. How I wish there were more films like this one to revel in!",/review/rw8736453/?ref_=tt_urv

27 November 2022,gandlbest,," Just plain sweet
","A feel good movie. Not just for kids. Plus a lesson about acceptance, worth, and not having to fit in. Also about restorative joy. Beautiful songs and of course Shawn Mendes ' amazing voice. The family aspect was beautiful too. And the villians were not that villianous, showing forgiveness and repentance. Even the implausible became palatable, literally. I liked the cinematography as well. They didn't skimp on anything. Even the cat was well played. CGI but it needed to be (like Call of the Wild CGI). If you want to laugh and cheer on and rediscover hope, and have a few twists and turns along the way, I highly recommend Lyle. Now, I want to read the book series with my family.",/review/rw8736453/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2022,jace_the_film_guy,5," Rip up the Recipe!
","With a strong message at its core and a likable cast of characters, ""Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile"" is great, family fun. The story starts a bit slow, but once the music begins everything changes. Just like in ""The Greatest Showman"", ""Dear Evan Hansen"" and ""Trolls"", Pasek and Paul show their skills with the music in this film. Each song adds depth to the story and elevates the otherwise slow-paced script.",/review/rw8736453/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2022,UniqueParticle,7," My middle name is Lyle so I had to see this it was pretty good
","I didn't realize the bulk of it is a musical which I really am not a fan of but I really liked this for what it is. Quite heartwarming, adorable, full of delightfulness, and great for the family! I love Prim family and Lyle was spot on throughout. The directors are great for feel good movies I really like one of their other films Office Christmas Party, nice to see something more innocent! Javier Bardem is basically David Copperfield character that's kind of perfect joke he's solid though. All the bonding with Lyle is the best aspects, for someone that doesn't like singing in movies this is one of the best ones that I would recommend.",/review/rw8736453/?ref_=tt_urv

30 November 2022,cahidi,7," Singing Crocodile
","It's kinda hard to believe that something who can sing, can't talk, when it can clearly understand the language. But seeing how it's based on a children's book, I won't make a fuss about it. Especially when the story is exceptional and heartwarming. When I read the synopsis, I was intrigued. So, I decided to watch it. And I don't regret it at all. As a musical, it has quite a few good songs. And Shawn Mendes is obviously the right choice to play Lyle. And even though I really wish Lyle can talk, cause it can make the comedy part even better, but I can guarantee that you won't regret watching this movie. Especially with your family.",/review/rw8736453/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,JankiSharma,10," True sharing , affection,love and happiness give courage
","Josh Gordon directed a pleasant movie Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile set in NYC. The movie is based on book series by Bernard Waber. Lyle a crocodile (voiced by Shawn Mendes) is the main character. Lyle has emotions and responds very well to affection, selflessness, acts of kindness, love filled words and music. Hector Valenti (talented Javier Bardem from Vicki Christina Barcelona and No country for old men) is kind and loves Lyle but also has selfish motive of making a lot of money with his own magician abilities and singing Lyle. But Lyle sees through Hector's selfishness and freezes in front of audience. Then comes the Primm family. Mrs Primm (Constance Wu from Crazy Rich Asians and Hustlers) author of cookbooks, her husband (Scoot McNairy from Luckiest girl in the world, Argo) with a new teaching job in NYC school and their son Josh (Winslow Fegley) move into Hector's townhouse without realizing Hector left Lyle in the attic with a note. The friendship between Lyle and Josh, only child and lonely boy, is full of niceness, true affection and fun enjoyable pastimes. Mrs Primm warms up to Lyle and has fun happy days filled with songs and happiness. Lyle eventually makes friends with Mr Primm and wins him over. Primm family and Lyle become inseparables. Hector learns his lesson just from watching Primms . True love just needs true understanding. Shawn Mendes voice is a huge plus point for the movie.",/review/rw8736453/?ref_=tt_urv
