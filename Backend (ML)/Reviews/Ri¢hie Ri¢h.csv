11 December 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Really well written and acted series!
","The White Lotus is so much better than I expected. Both seasons have all-star casts from top to bottom and all do an incredible job. I can't point that out enough, both casts are perfect. Also, the visuals on this show are just beautiful. This series has already won so many awards for season one and I expect season two to win just as many. It's both funny and serious in how it shows the difference in classes and how some of the wealthy and privileged live their lives. There are no real villains in this show but definitely some frustrating and annoying characters. There are so many great characters that everyone will have their favorite and most annoying.",/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2021,avisdolphin,9," We Have All Met These People
","A train wreck of characters....compelling, vile, and darkly hilarious. While we are led to believe one person dies at the beginning of the first episode, as the series progresses, you desperately hope that they all do. Highly recommended.",/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," I enjoyed it!
","I went into watching The White Lotus not really knowing what to expect. I just finished the second season and now know why it's had so many great reviews and won so many awards. What makes this show so good is the acting and the writing. Each character is beautifully written and acted, not a weak link on either season. HBO always puts out great content and this is no different. It's not a show for everyone but I definitely enjoyed it. It's one of the rare anthology shows where both seasons are equally as good. I'm now looking forward to future seasons of The White Lotus and hope they stay as good as these first two.",/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2021,lee_eisenberg,10," no, this is not ""rich people problems""
","Right after ""The White Lotus"" debuted, a criticism that I read was that the series was the latest focus on so-called rich people problems.",/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2022,oasomera,9," The most impressive series I've ever seen
",Though some of the first season was cringe-worthy. This second season is about as masterful as anyone could hope for.,/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,jon-stokes21-539-17875,8," I'm Glad I Didn't Watch This When It Aired!
","I will say from the start this isn't a series for everyone, it's different, there's tons of charecter development, and it's a show I'd find much more enjoyable binge watching then consuming one episode per week.",/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2021,idospasjody,10," This is the BEST dark comedy in years
",Season 1 is a gem. The writing and acting is amazing. I can't wait for every Sunday evening. I wish I wouldn't have started it so I could binge watch the hole thing. There are parts that it takes a few seconds for your brain to process and then bang OMG laugh out loud funny. Rewind watch again funny. The story telling is masterful. Only thing wrong with this show is can't find anything to it's equal wile waiting for the next one to be released. Now that the next one is being released I'm going to wait and watch it when it's all done this is a show that is hard to wait for every Sunday so I'll be patient and just binge watch it.,/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2021,maxinepuffington,10," Cringe in its best
","It's not for everyone's taste but if someone likes weird and satiric humor, can enjoy cringe and slow-burn stories with layers then it would be one of the best from recent shows. Finally something different.",/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2021,NicholasBarton,9," Jennifer Coolidge is Amazing in this!
","I really hope she gets some award consideration love. Every single scene she is in is cringeworthy, fun, and full of depth. She's killing it!",/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2021,gallagherkellie,4," So confused by the praise for this show
","I pushed through and watched it all because I felt bad leaving a bad review on something without watching it all. I think this show tried to rely on shocking and weird moments as opposed to good storylines. I was bored throughout most of the show, and I didn't find it funny at all. I'm very very surprised at how many people love it so much including my friends who were so sure that I would like it too. And it's not even because the characters are unlikable. They are meant to be unlikable and most of the actors do it well. It was very easy to watch so I'll give it that.",/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2021,thedongwu,9," Funny and clever class commentary
","This is a great and unexpected comedy driven by its complex and layered characters, each of whom play an important part in the show's social commentary and satire. Each member of the class plays their role to perfection, in particular, Jake Lacy as a self absorbed rich kid and Jennifer Coolidge as a tragic figure who is inevitably trapped in her toxic patterns and blinded by her privilege. Murray Bartlett and Natasha Rothwell also do an incredible job as the sympathetic hotel staff who have to deal with the nonsense their guests throw at them every day-meanwhile, Fred Hechinger was a surprising stand out, playing a quiet, unassuming character who grew to be one of my favourites in the season.",/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2021,vokeynick,10," Brilliant so far
","This is currently my favorite show that's running (honestly though, it doesn't have much competition). The music is phenomenal and I hope the composer wins an award. It's not everybody's brand of comedy, but just because something isn't lol funny doesn't mean it's not funny. Although we're at episode 3 and nothing of huge significance has happened yet, I'm 100% invested in the characters and can't wait to watch it every week.",/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2022,elena-grandal,10," I really liked the first season, but I LOVED the second
",I am obsessed about season 2. There are so many fascinating characters and the performance of the actors behind them is superb.,/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2021,EPMD57,3," Not my style of humour
","You have to like satire to like this. For me, it's just too detached from reality. I get what they're saying about society, but I just don't find it entertaining enough. Obviously everyone's unlikable traits are overplayed for comedic effect, but to me, that just makes the viewing experience uncomfortably annoying.",/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2021,slowpulse,5," A study of intolerable behavior
","Honestly, this almost feels like an experiment, created to see if it's possible to cram as many cringe-worthy moments as possible in a show, before the viewers give up. It's beautifully packaged, no doubt, with good direction, good cinematography and generally good acting, but I physically hated each and every one of the characters - no one excluded - and spent all my time wondering why their behavior ranged somewhere from mildly deplorable to downright unbearable.",/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv

16 August 2021,nielssloos-17186,7," A bit of a mixed bag
",The show started off really great introducing us to all the characters. Especially the struggles of the staff is portrayed well in this shown. Keeping up a happy face all the time.,/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2021,Aristides-2,3," Difficult Show To Rate
","It's a difficult show to rate because of the high quality of the first 5 shows and the very low story quality of episode 6. Deal breaking examples of the last episode 6, of Season 1:
1. The dropping of the most important supporting character, Kai. (What happened to cause his arrest? We'll never know because he disappears from the series.",/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv

11 December 2022,LongTimeMovieLover,9," Great.
","The first season was great! If Murray Bartlett does not win an award, it would really be too bad. Some of his expressions were so nuanced for very screwy situations, ala the scent at the table giving homosexual clues. I loved everything, although perhaps Molly Shannon did not fit for me as perfectly as some of the other characters. Also, Sydney Sweeney was wonderful as a droll and spoiled Gen Z. Generally well written, well cast, well scored and well directed. Just enough conflict and resolution. This may be more appealing for those of us who know people who fit into the roles or situations, which makes it more interesting, of course. It's not really simplistic, but a complex mix of 2022 rich people-type problems. Substance and nonsense. Like many of the HBO successes, this series is complex enough to watch more than one time. Kudos to Mr. White.",/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2022,intrepidami,3," I read through the 10/10 reviews to see...
","....What this steaming pile did that excited Mike White fans. This is an actual quote! ""just because something isn't funny, doesn't mean it's not funny"". One of the main characters is Rachel. Rachel is a young lady who wrote click bait articles when she met Shane. She admittedly married him very quickly. Shane is a total self absorbed, spoiled dick. This is hammered at you constantly. He spends the entirety of this engaged in warfare with the manager. Rachel slowly comes to the realization she is nothing more than a trophy wife. She is a cardboard dress up doll. She can't work because if people found out it would reflect badly on Shane. They dance around that, but never speak it. His family is all about image as well as wealth. We watch a seemingly smart woman rail and rail against this...until SHE DOESN'T???? She gives in to the fact she's going to be nothing but arm candy?? That he's not ever going to change? WTF is wrong with people? To think this was some masterpiece. It's truly terrible! Are you that blinded by pretty people that you ignore the content? And that's just one of the bad stories. Sure it reflects badly on the elite rich, but it also shows how normal people do bad things too. Is the message you'd do it too, if you were in their shoes?",/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2021,mamet-94713,4," Not funny or even clever
","I don't get the hype of this show. The tone seems off, the writing sluggish and the characters are unbelievable. They all seem like strangers with no connection. Also, are we to believe Rachel didn't know Shane was an idiot before she married him? Also, why does every teenager look like they are 27 years old. After two episodes, I'm out.",/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2022,tomwins1,9," Interesting and revealing
",I'm a 65 year old man and the first two seasons of White Lotus have pulled me in. I've learned so many lessons in life with a drive to know what is most important values and paths to pursue.,/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2021,whatithinkis,7," WHAT a FUN surprise
","The writing, the acting, the camera work, sets . . . EVERYTHING . . . AND a friendly dick pic as well to warm the cockles of my heart. I was expecting some soapy nonsense with canned laughter and instead found writing with depth and complexity AND an interesting murder mystery, which, in opening scenes suggest one thing, but could turn out to be something else entirely.",/review/rw7125643/?ref_=tt_urv
