26 December 2021,djurrepower,7," fastest 3rd act in the wild west
","Somehow I feel like this movie isn't finished. I see a lot of great work, and good ideas. But the story feels unfinished. This is most notible when we have the highpoint of the conflict in the last scene of the 2nd act. And this conflict is resolved the very next scene. And I can't help but feel that this story had so much more to explore. I could have seen this movie surpas coco, with it's more original story, but alas.",/review/rw7719837/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2021,lee_eisenberg,7," ""No one is youer than you."" - Dr. Seuss
","I interpreted ""Encanto"" to mean that one's strength is not determined by traditions or other people's understanding of strength. Strength is about knowing the ethical thing to do, even if it challenges tradition.",/review/rw7719837/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2021,cricketbat,7," Magical, but not quite enchanting as it could have been
","Encanto is a creative movie featuring beautiful and vibrant animation. However, the story feels a little underdeveloped. While there are some magical and emotional moments, it seems as if they didn't know how to end the movie. The lack of a strong villain also makes this movie a little less compelling. Nevertheless, the music is fun, and we enjoyed watching Encanto together as a family.",/review/rw7719837/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2021,masonsaul,9," Incredible Disney animated movie
","Encanto is another Incredible Disney animated movie that continues their winning streak with a fun, extremely vibrant and emotional film that also has great messages and mature themes, even if the narrative is predictable.",/review/rw7719837/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2021,SnoopyStyle,9," magical
","The Madrigals live in a magic house under the protection of an everlasting magic candle. The candle imparts a special power to each one of the Madrigal kids except for Mirabel. She feels left behind. When she has a vision of devastating cracks in the house, her Abuela wants to cover it up and ignore it.",/review/rw7719837/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2021,actaction,5," No Real Problem to Solve
","It keeps talking about magic ending, because of selfishness; but specific selfishness isn't really shown to us by the grandmother... so why does the door close at the beginning (did the grandmother try to stop the magic from continuing because of the prophecy?). The problem isn't ever really that big of a deal & whatever it was it solved itself, with very little effort or adventure or hurdles to overcome. Basically, they are afraid of messing up the magic so they mess up the magic. They they become brave and love each other and everything is fine after all. I guess that's what I just watched. Pretty animation, not bad characters, but not memorable at all.",/review/rw7719837/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2021,matthewssilverhammer,10," My favorite Disney film since Frozen.
","While it has some of the current Disney tropes, it's refreshing to watch a film & not know where it's going - unique characters, plot twists, story turns, emotional gut-punches. It's a movie about magic that reminds us that real magic is when one person puts someone else above themselves. A vibrantly beautiful, hopeful, exciting, & consistently funny treasure that argues that when we prioritize the facade of strength & love over the reality of them, we lose both.",/review/rw7719837/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2022,MissSimonetta,5," Disney on autopilot
","When someone calls a movie ""cute"" in my social circle, it generally means that the movie was inoffensive but not memorable. That describes ENCANTO to a T. The characters are amusing and the animation is lovely (particularly the use of color), but the story seems less like a structured plot than a meandering series of musical setpieces. The music is not particularly memorable either-- I saw this movie two days ago and about all I can recall is the chorus of ""We Don't Talk About Bruno.""",/review/rw7719837/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2022,Sandra-durand80,5," Not what I expected
","The animation is beautiful, bright and colorful. The voice acting was wonderful. The storyline was okay. Too much singing. I know I sound horrible saying that, but I wished they could've toned it down with the singing. My young sons were a little bored and I was too. I mean, it's a very nice movie, don't get me wrong, but it's not a 10-star movie in my opinion.",/review/rw7719837/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2022,KiParvizi,6," Great Soundtrack, Not-So-Great Storyline
","Though I usually tend to love Disney films, I felt ""Encanto"" fell short in terms of its plotline. It's a bit of a slow starter, which contributes to my fairly mid rating. However, whatever the storyline lacked, the soundtrack gave double. You won't be able to get these songs out of your head (and I'm okay with that)!",/review/rw7719837/?ref_=tt_urv

31 January 2022,aaronjconroy,2," Not all that; big letdown
","I really thought I would like this film a lot more but it didn't grip me at all. Doesn't have a patch on Luca or Coco from recent years. The only reason I gave it 3 starts out of ten is that the main character is likable but it lacks anything memorable, overdoes the same scenes that doesn't progress the plot and the ending was so close to being good then they botched it by Disney-ing it up.",/review/rw7719837/?ref_=tt_urv

24 November 2021,chris_rowe-881-168820,5," Very average
","I get Disney is getting deeper and trying to show more important topics but this film felt very average, as a huge Disney fan I've seen 95% of the films, love some golden oldies but moana and coco are two of my favourites, I Was pumped for this.",/review/rw7719837/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2022,pisceschick-00175,6," I probably expected more
",It was cute. Mostly entertaining but I got bored many times (maybe because I'm an adult and this is geared toward kids). I heard a lot of great things and people told me to watch it but I didn't really love it. I don't see myself watching it again anytime soon. I think I expected too much also because I absolutely loved Coco and it's one of my favorite films.,/review/rw7719837/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2021,drael64,5," Bored me silly in minutes

26 December 2021,paul_haakonsen,5," I wasn't enchanted...
","When I saw the posters hanging around town for the upcoming Disney animated movie ""Encanto"", I must admit that I was definitely interested in watching it. Sure, I didn't even know what it was about, but I liked the posters, and let's just face it, Disney does usually pump out pretty good animated movies.",/review/rw7719837/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2022,damorejj,5," Wasn't really impressed
",I enjoyed the visual effects and the colors but I never really seemed to grow to care for any of the characters other than Mirabel. Plus there once again were no real villians in this movie. It's almost as if Disney in these ridiculously woke times is afraid to make a bad guy. So many of their movies are about a female who is outcast or in the shadows of her peers and finds herself. It's just really overdone.,/review/rw7719837/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2021,jbbabycrafts,5," Beautiful visuals, underdeveloped story
","This movie was lovely to look at and as others have noted, it was refreshing to see cartoon characters who looked more like every day life. The story itself was simply missing. It's a shame because there were so many, and I mean many, interesting characters to work with. One of the great things about The Incredibles was how characters creatively used their powers to face problems. This movie could have benefited from the same formula tackling family dynamics, learning to value one another's unique contributions, while facing an outside threat. In this case, the crisis of dwindling magic and a crumbling house wasn't enough to create an engaging story. When it ended we all looked at each other surprised and confused- that's it? It's over? It was fine to watch it once in Disney+ without paying extra. Just disappointing.",/review/rw7719837/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2022,Deathstryke,4," Ironic that for all its focus on magic, Encanto lacks the 'Disney magic' that makes the classics so memorable.
","Encanto, the latest misfire in Disney's increasingly dull catalogue, props up a bland story about a simple family dispute with lots of colour and spectacle, but very little in the way of real conflict or emotional stakes.",/review/rw7719837/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2022,garabedian123,5," Some strange story telling devices

5 December 2021,Sir_AmirSyarif,6," Fails to enchant
","Byron Howard and Jared Bush's 'Encanto' is bright and colorful, yet it fails to enchant. It has some brilliant, visually appealing scenes and plenty of entertaining musical numbers to keep audience hooked, but the plot feels undercooked and trivial.",/review/rw7719837/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2022,samjlopes,5," No Encanto
",Very interesting idea but boring and not so magical execution. Wasted potential. Flat story and predictable. Songs are forgettable. No Disney magic here.,/review/rw7719837/?ref_=tt_urv
