24 September 2014,redwriteandblue,9," Hope it lasts, the pilot was a good start (especially for a pilot) ...
","Finally watched the pilot (episode two tonight); really impressed. Just the right mix of light comedy and mystery, without one genre encroaching on the other. Debra Messing is, as always, like comfort food to watch. Really hope this lasts, even as a mystery level enjoyed the storyline of the pilot. Just wanna take a strap or something to her kids' backsides on the show, though; what hellions! Anyway, LOVED IT ... which, of course, means it will most likely be canceled after a few episodes.",/review/rw3097137/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2022,tailsofthewind,10," I really want to purchase this. Please offer it on iTunes!
","It's too bad that this was canceled, sometimes this happens to great shows. It has a great, diverse cast, and unfortunately that's rare. Please release this digitally so it can be seen by those who appreciate it. I'd love to add it to my collection!",/review/rw3097137/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2016,Tweekums,8," An enjoyably cop show that was cancelled too soon
","This entertaining cop show is set in New York and follows the eponymous Detective Laura Diamond as she and her colleagues solve a variety of murders. Things are slightly complicated by the fact that her captain, Jake, is also her ex-husband and back home she has a couple of rather wild twin boys to look after.",/review/rw3097137/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2015,pimplepopper,10," I love this show
","I admit I watched because I was happy to see ""Grace"" had another job... But even though the pilot had moments of dodgy, by no means was that Debra Messing's fault, in fact by the end she was ""Laura"" in my mind and I was coming back for more. To my delight the show improves with every episode until at the end if the season I had to write this. Give it a chance. :-) All of the characters grow on you and there are some real moments of hilarity, the mysteries keep you guessing and yes it's not the newest formula, but that's OK its comfortable and lovely that you can trust they aren't gonna kill off your favorite characters suddenly Love it :-)",/review/rw3097137/?ref_=tt_urv

18 September 2014,MsMovie,7," OK, changing initial review - which rarely happens!!!
","My initial review was on the pilot and I said this has the makings of a decent show. It has a great cast, great location, limitless crime stories to take from real life and fictionalize.",/review/rw3097137/?ref_=tt_urv

25 September 2014,drewkittell,10," Mysteries of Laura is simply Refreshing, Comical and Original
","Great job NBC, Debra Messing, cast and crew!! In this genre of homicide detectives in New York City, it is REFRESHING, to get done with a long day and have a new cop drama that has the humor and simplicity to include the realities of how most of us try to get by. It isn't meant to be another deep, dark, and serious everyone pull out their guns kind of drama with all the characters in the show going through some kind of mental breakdown each new season. In the pilot and the second episode, it wasn't at all easy to figure out the mystery, so it is also fun to see where the story does lead. So, I say give this show a chance, catch up on it, and sit back for some laughs.",/review/rw3097137/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2015,tiggersgirl-52750,10," Hilarious family show!
","I love this show and it is such a great show you don't have to worry about your kids walking in on. It has its serious moments and great comedy. She always gets the criminal, but in her own snazzy way. We need more shows like this one! There's too many drama filled, cuss word filled shows out there that kids should not watch and this is one my son can play in the room while its on and we can just relax. Hope they don't cancel it! All the characters are unique and perfect in the show. <3 By far one of my favorite new series out on TV today. <3 Mysteries of Laura is fantastic! And they have to keep it around. 10 stars! I live how she is always herself, and no matter what she can figure out who committed the crime. She has this way of attention to detail that just shows how smart she is. Some may think this is too silly a show but I think that is what makes it so great! Shows don't have to serious all the time, and this show's comedy is perfect. Not stupid funny but actually lol funny. I laugh so much that my husband started watching with me and now he likes it. We introduced my sister in law to it and she is a die hard sci fi fan and even she loves it now!",/review/rw3097137/?ref_=tt_urv

3 May 2015,patfitz-59938,10," Love it...
","I really love this show, it is real, down to earth and downright funny as well. As a working woman all my life with 4 children, women have it a lot harder than most men as their job doesn't end when they come home from work, it is just beginning. Debra Messing does a great job as a super smart detective, who gets the job done while still juggling all the chaos in her life. It's real life and funny. The cast works so well together, each with their own personality and dramas. My husband didn't watch it with me at first, but know he's also gotten into it as well and that is very unusual. Please consider giving it a chance at another season, it keeps getting better and better.",/review/rw3097137/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2014,riki-wells1966,8," good for a chuckle
","Maybe it's because I relate to her character with the straying husband (now my ex also), the 2 children, full-time job, etc, but I love this show. As for the crime & figuring out whodunit, I haven't seen much difference from other cop shows, so to give that aspect a bad review makes it obvious that person is just down on this show, not the content. Yes, I am a fan of Debra Messing and I'm so excited to see her portraying a character that is so strong yet so maternal. And yes, it's a plus that I get to watch Josh Lucas on TV after falling for him on the big screen. I truly enjoy this show! I find myself laughing at all the little jokes, the play on words, and whatever else tickles my funny bone. And when the hour is done, I find myself in good humor! This show makes me smile!",/review/rw3097137/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2017,bombad_general,10," Significantly better than its reputation - a victim of atrocious timing.
","OK, first off with the negative stuff: The format was planted into a completely saturated market, and, with all the competition, the series is nothing terribly new. Had the creators maybe waited until ""Castle"" or ""Rizzoli & Isles"" had aired their last season, this series would have filled a great gap - the witty cop show that makes you feel better for watching it. Now the two aforementioned series have run their course, and ""The Mysteries of Laura"" has undeservedly tanked after two seasons (with nothing to replace it, really). Fantastic.",/review/rw3097137/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2015,overminded,10," Very interesting and entertaining show
","Having seen the original series ""Los Misterios de Laura,"" from Spain, I was wondering what NBC's version would be like. I was pleasantly surprised when I finally saw the show. I enjoyed the fact that the original structure stayed the same (single mom detective having her ex as her boss and managing work and home life at the same time) while the characters were adapted to match the U.S. environment. The mixed reviews show how difficult it is to adapt from an original written for a completely different cultural setting. As with the original version, I like following the little clues that lead to resolving the cases intermingled with Laura's personal life conflicts. I am looking forward to seeing its future episodes.",/review/rw3097137/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2014,missmary1983-475-122135,8," Good show with potential to be great
","Debra Messing is a person who plays quirky characters. Some viewers will never like her. She isn't deadpan, she isn't mean (see: House). She is however good with her timing and a good actress. The show's premiere was a bit weak but still enjoyable but this is typical of pilots/premieres - you have to be introduced to characters. However, over the last two episodes, the characters settled down into their roles and the 3rd episode was wonderful. Critics - as usual - will loathe a show that doesn't fit a specific mold and to be sure, this show doesn't. They hated many other successful shows such as House for Hugh Laurie being ""too mean"". We all ended up loving him. If this show is given that chance, we will also grow to love the characters. People expect blockbusters for pilots and this is why so many shows fail, but if these shows go for blockbusters, they leave for the show not maintaining that hype or never introducing them.",/review/rw3097137/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2014,shalimarsubagja,10," funny and girlie
","I love crime drama. And universe gives me more than I can watch. I'm grateful for that, but somehow... I'm getting bored. The genre is getting saturated with similar type of forensic process scene and less sleuthing.",/review/rw3097137/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2015,salibaerik,10," 20 mins in I was HOOKED!
","I watch a lot of TV series, and I can easily say that I have never liked a series from the first episode (pilot). I usually come here on IMDb, read a few reviews, and if I like what I see I watch the first 3-5 episodes of the series before deciding to continue watching or not. ",/review/rw3097137/?ref_=tt_urv

25 September 2014,greysonfurrington,9," Debra Messing is Back!
","Finally a cop show I can watch with my wife! She hates Law & Order and all their countless, predictable shows. But this - The Mysteries of Laura kept her on the couch the entire episode. (Usually gets up to Facebook) I thought it was great. The only reason I can't give it a 10 is in what world would a detective just happen to have their boss be their ex? I'm fairly confident upper brass would have something to say about that but not in Laura's world. Eh, it's some writer's idea of a joke and it's kinda not funny.",/review/rw3097137/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2014,jmcgil22,1," Unimaginative, predictable and BORING!
","The characters and plot lines of this show are predictable, unimaginative and BORING! Debra Messing was great in Will & Grace, but it seems her success was due to shared screen time and a terrific ensemble cast. Here, Messing takes the lead role, essentially carrying the show, and she just isn't charismatic enough to pull it off. The writing is just as bad, with plots that are insulting to anyone with even average intelligence. For example, while investigating a killing, Laura suspects that her boss is the murderer, even though she has no real evidence. Instead of confronting him directly or going to IA, she makes the accusations in public at the victim's funeral. Seriously?! There is zero entertainment value here, and I don't see this show being renewed for another season.",/review/rw3097137/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2014,trochetorres,9," Fun to watch!
","I must admit I was not crazy about the pilot episode. I kind of liked it but really didn't like the way the kids were portrayed. It was just too much. I gave it a chance and haven't missed and episode since. I love suspense and USED to like comedy but most comedy shows out there are ridiculous. This is just right for me... looking to solve the mysteries and a couple of giggles along the way. Well made show, great supporting actors/actresses and Debra Messing delivers a great performance. And by the way, I was never a Debra Messing fan before and disliked her pathetic character on Will and Grace. Thumbs up for her on this show!",/review/rw3097137/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2016,fcmjager,9," Love it
","I've only known Debra Messing in will&grace so i had my concerns for this show. But, i love it. Yes, it has nothing to do with actual police work, but hey, its a show. And it entertains me. I record the show so that i, when my baby sleeps, i can enjoy a fun and easy going show. Its fun and Debra is great as an single mom. Although i can never get my hair like that in between throwing up and changing diapers. So no, it's not reality TV, but if you enjoy comedy and crime, and loved will & grace, this is your show. Okey, i need at least 10 lines to post... I have only seen season one, but i cannot wait till season 2. Have fun watching this fun show. Don't expect Oscar winning acting or amazing screenplay, it's just fun",/review/rw3097137/?ref_=tt_urv

2 October 2014,dustinwaine,8," Cute, quirky show that only Debra Messing could pull off
","I will add the disclaimer that I have always loved Debra Messing. She has a comedic energy that for me, is reminiscent of Lucille Ball and Debbie Reynolds. Cop shows are usually dark and melodramatic, so I find the slightly comedic tone of ""Mysteries of Laura"" to be refreshing.",/review/rw3097137/?ref_=tt_urv
