3 April 2014,caseymoviemania,5," Schwarzenegger delivers a rare dark performance in this extremely violent but ponderous cop thriller.
","From TRAINING DAY (2001), DARK BLUE (2002), HARSH TIMES (2005), STREET KINGS (2008) and END OF WATCH (2012) at which he either writes, directs or doing both duties, David Ayer has crafted quite a career for himself as the go-to guy when comes to movie that explores the dark side of a law enforcement. This year is no different as Ayer explores the same territory again with SABOTAGE. But what's really interesting about his latest effort is his first-time collaboration with the former '80s and '90s king of big action icon Arnold Schwarzenegger playing the kind of role unlike anything fans have seen him before... well, at least not since 1984's THE TERMINATOR or to certain extent, 1997's BATMAN AND ROBIN.",/review/rw3046859/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2014,shawneofthedead,6," A bit of a mess - narratively and literally - but this is still a brutal, surprisingly compelling film featuring a great lead performance by Schwarzenegger.
","There are plenty of reasons to dislike Sabotage, the latest flick starring the Governator, Arnold Schwarzenegger. It's relentlessly gory, and occasionally storms head-first into dumb, torture-porn territory. Anyone watching it for its purported connection to Agatha Christie's most-beloved mystery novel, And Then There Were None, will be disappointed - the considerably less brainy film is, at best, only vaguely inspired by the ingenious twists of the book. But Sabotage remains compelling almost all the way through, and is all the more notable for featuring one of Schwarzenegger's finest, darkest performances yet.",/review/rw3046859/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Not impressed
","This kind of movie is David Ayer's bread & butter, and he has a good cast to work with including Schwarzenegger, Worthington, Howard and Enos. The problem is that the script isn't tight enough and I didn't believe some of the actions of the characters. Worth a watch if you are fans of the genre or the actors, otherwise skip it.",/review/rw3046859/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2015,Finfrosk86,8," Entertaining, brutal action-thriller
","Why did this flop, and why is it rated to low!? I don't quite get that. No, it is not the only movie you ever need to see, but it is pretty darn entertaining, I'll tell ya.",/review/rw3046859/?ref_=tt_urv

14 July 2014,MovieAddict2016,3," I love Schwarzenegger, but this is one of his worst movies.
","""Sabotage"" looked amazing on paper, and at one point early on in production, it was one of my most highly-anticipated action films. First of all, you've got David Ayer coming fresh off the critical and commercial success of ""End of Watch,"" one of the best cop films in recent memory; then you've got a pretty good supporting cast (Worthington, Howard and Manganiello are fine enough for the kinds of roles they're playing here). But mostly you've got Arnold playing his least quintessential role -- what I mean by this is that, over the years, even in his more dramatic fare, Arnold has always enjoyed self- posturing and falling back on his reputation when he plays characters. There's nothing wrong with that, but at a certain point, the wink-wink, nudge-nudge stuff gets a bit repetitive; I thought ""Last Stand"" was a fun spaghetti western, but it was Arnold playing an older Arnold, complete with the ""I'll be back"" puns and jokey homages to older films.",/review/rw3046859/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2014,demnarchangel,7," More story, less action. That is OK!
","The movie is not bad at all, not sure why everyone says it is. Especially when the review just says it is bad and gives no explanation other than implying there is no plot.",/review/rw3046859/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2014,neil-476,7," Suspense mystery with action, not action thriller
","John ""Breacher"" Wharton (Arnold Schwarzenegger) heads up a DEA Special Ops Squad which is brutally effective. The enquiry which follows money going missing during a raid takes its toll on the bonding within the squad which, in turn, leads to complications when someone starts killing squad members.",/review/rw3046859/?ref_=tt_urv

28 March 2014,Rebel_With_A_Cause_94,8," Delivers as an Action/Crime Thriller with one of Arnold's Best Performances To Date!
","Don't listen to the critics! Go see this movie if you are an Arnold fan! Unlike The Last Stand and Bullet to the Head, this is a straight up dark gritty crime thriller with some great action sequences. While most of the team was unlikable, all of the cast gave good performances aside from Olivia Williams who's accent was pretty bad. The story was good and had enough twist and turns to keep me on the edge of my seat for the majority of the film. The action scenes were fantastic and the violence was incredibly brutal and gory! This is one of the most violent mainstream movies I've seen in a long time! Trust me when I say this movie earned it's R rating! I loved how David Ayer managed to combine the genres of action, crime drama, and western elements together while keeping the tone ultra dark and gritty. Arnolds performance here is also one of the best of his career in my opinion. If I had any complaints it's that it is true the characters are very unlikeable and while they are suppose to be, you do get tired of their crudeness pretty fast.",/review/rw3046859/?ref_=tt_urv

16 July 2014,siderite,6," Unexpected mystery action thriller, but not very good
","A lot of people left disappointed by the movie and for a very good reason: it was marketed (I just rewatched the trailer now to make sure) as an action revenge flick. You expect some good old fashioned Arnold bashing of bad guys and instead you get a ""10 Little N!ggers"" like mystery thriller with extra blood and gun violence. I mean, when I saw that Martini's character died, I thought ""the team"" would wreak havoc on those murderous cartels. I even made a mental note to title the review ""No Martini, no party"", but the movie was not about that at all.",/review/rw3046859/?ref_=tt_urv

2 April 2014,billygoat1071,4," Cold-Blooded Reality
","Which is obvious for a David Ayer film, Sabotage gives a grounded depiction to the realm of corruption. It begins acknowledging that crime is nothing to be taken as a joke and one has to think through the stakes before the situation leads to their love ones. It's quite a risky subject taken place on a job of DEA. While the protagonists are hotshots, they also have the capability to get killed in the most mundane ways. But the film meanwhile negates the grander realities and ends up indulging itself into a relentless murder machine that doesn't always make sense. It would be pleasurable if you have fetish for gore, but for the commentaries, it is thematically vague.",/review/rw3046859/?ref_=tt_urv

Arnie: ""Duh!...I was hoping you would have some ideas."" David: ""Ok, just round up some actors and I will get Skip Woods to write a story.""

8 July 2014,zsappenfield,9," Don't care about others, this is an Arnold COME BACK!!
","The whole cast was great don't get me wrong, and i enjoyed the plot of the whole film, as much as it could have been a little longer with a few more, twists and turns, it still got the point with lots of gun fire, lots of ""breaching"" and lots of cussing for no reason. Arnold himself being team leader, did a great job, and finished his mission no matter what, i enjoyed the hell out of this film and i think it was a come back for Arnold, it wasn't a flop (in my head, again most people are posting that it was crap and Arnold is done, blah blah blah) This movie had everything going for it, action packed, lots of good actors, lots of crazy gun fights, lots of cussing and dirty jokes, i saw a review that said this is a ""guilty pleasure for manly men"".....honestly its just a guilty pleasure for anyone who likes action movies and Arnold surrounded by a group of good actors, i hope to see him doing more movies like this (unlike the expendables, which i am not the biggest fan of) this movie was more about him and less about the other actors, i think anyone who is an action movie fan, and an Arnold fan....would enjoy this....so give it a shot. seriously :)",/review/rw3046859/?ref_=tt_urv

",This is not your typical Arnold Schwarzenegger film that most of us are use to from the 80s and even the 90s. Instead we get a film that relies mostly its its good story with very good action scenes here and there. Some may be disappointed by this as we are all use to those amazing summer blockbusters that Arnold was in in the past. Arnold is not getting any younger. I know this and we all should know it. However this film is a very fun film to see at the theaters.,/review/rw3046859/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2014,Seraphion,3," Well This is one of the worst movies Schwarzenegger is in
","Just another common basic premise of revenge within the law enforcement, although this time it takes place within the DEA. Though it gruesomely plunges the viewers into the heat at the start, the story develops so very slowly. Despite being an action movie, the mood of the entire movie feels so slow, especially after the first ten to fifteen minutes of breaching sequence.The pace looks like it's trying to make those of 1990s action movies as reference, where they have a quick, very quick, action packed sequences in the start, yet slows down in the middle parts, and then go back and speeds up at the end parts. The action is not so worthy to be played by Arnold. The director only adds a lot of blood to the scene to make it more gory, but that didn't do the trick. The acting, despite having more than a few action stars, is so average.",/review/rw3046859/?ref_=tt_urv
