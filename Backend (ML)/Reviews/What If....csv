11 March 2018,Special-K88,," a touching throwback to the adolescent years
","In the year 2002, Catholic high school senior Christine McPherson, self-named ""Lady Bird,"" is an impetuous girl literally from the wrong side of the tracks who's at a critical stage in her life: she's continually at odds with her mother, despises her mundane life in Sacramento, and wants to go to college on the east coast in a city with culture. Her ordinary life suddenly takes a turn when she has to deal with popularity, discovering boys and romance, and coping with the problems of people other than her own. Cute, quirky, and thoughtful coming-of-age story is one everyone can relate to, with the all-important themes of teen angst, adolescence, and ambition; colorful dialogue, well-drawn characters, and believable situations are only elevated by a talented cast of actors. Twenty-three-year-old Ronan perfectly embodies the spirit of a self-absorbed teenager in all her complexities, making it easy for viewers to recall a similar time period in their lives. ***",/review/rw4150004/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2018,Mike_Devine,7," Gerwig makes a statement on the importance of finding your voice
","Offbeat and off brand, Greta Gerwig's 2017 major studio directorial debut 'Lady Bird' is a tale of angst, stress and a strive for perfection and acceptance. The 2002-set film showcases Sacramento in all its glory - or perhaps, lack thereof - and puts Academy Award-nominee Saorise Ronan in the driver's seat to make an impact on audiences.",/review/rw4150004/?ref_=tt_urv

21 July 2018,SharkByteAudioProductions,8," A solid, mature and bittersweet coming-of-age tale that manages to shy away from its genre's conventions
","Lady Bird is surprisingly set in a post-9/11 Sacramento in 2002 , which is an un-usual but refreshing era for a modern coming-of-age story. While coming of age stories can often fall in to their charming but conventional trappings, Lady Bird shines in that it doesn't shy away from showing the faults of the characters it follows throughout its run time, almost to the point that you want to see even more of their journeys through life.",/review/rw4150004/?ref_=tt_urv

18 May 2018,Sebastien02,9," Refreshing
","This coming of age movie is finely written and directed by Greta Gerwig. She loosely bases the story on her own experiences growing up in Sacramento. The main character, Christine, is 17 years old and calls herself « Lady Bird ». I like her free spirit. Saoirse Ronan fully embodies the role, bringing her energy and her sense of humor. She gives a great performance, as does Laurie Metcalf. Both actresses perfectly capture the complex relationship between a mother and her daughter. The rest of the cast is also good, especially Lucas Hedges and Timothée Chalamet who play the boyfriends. The scenes with them are indeed funny and colorful. This bittersweet comedy deserves to be seen. It's a refreshing portrayal of teenage life.",/review/rw4150004/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,8," Lady Bird is a lovingly crafted coming-of-age drama.
","""Another one? Seriously. Will these ever stop?"" is probably what you are thinking. The answer is simple, the process of coming-of-age is relatable. A relatable story is one that viewers will warm to. Lady Bird is no different. It packs heart, plenty of character and subtle witty humour. A young girl, who titles herself ""Lady Bird"", is brought up in a catholic school and is at the stage of moving onto college. As with other synonymous films of this sub-genre, our teenage protagonist experiences their first love, family conflict and identity crisis. All part of the long process of growing up. This is nothing new, you may find its unoriginality to be a flaw but if it isn't broke...don't fix it. Also the short runtime results in a despondent narrative due to the amount of content being rammed into it. Despite the meaty plot, Lady Bird just works. So simple, yet incredibly effective. Addressing problematic themes of religious upbringing, materialism, guilt, wealth and the all important identity crisis when being a teenager. Gerwig may not be the most experienced director, but she definitely puts herself on the Hollywood map now. Nothing too fancy, a few quirks here and there but her reliance of the static camera position allows the actors to own the screen. She enables them to bring out the characters by simply giving them the whole screen. They are fundamentally the vital aspect. The characters themselves are fully realised and developed quite nicely, none of the events felt forced or coincidental and so the natural progression, particularly for Lady Bird and her mother, was presented efficiently. Ronan and Metcalf had a luminous chemistry together that felt both loving and prickly simultaneously. Hedges and Chalamet provided decent supporting roles also. I honestly don't have much else to say, if you've seen any coming-of-age film before then, really, you've seen this as well. Its formulaic approach is a small detriment to an incredibly acted, directed and written drama that will provide smiles all round.",/review/rw4150004/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2018,cricketbat,8," There's a lot to love about Lady Bird.
","Even though I was never a rebellious teenage girl at a catholic school in Sacramento, I still found myself relating to this quirky movie. Lady Bird captures the essence of what it's like to be a teenager. And while Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf really shine, each cast member adds something to the film. There's a lot to love about Lady Bird.",/review/rw4150004/?ref_=tt_urv

2 May 2018,tomgillespie2002,7," Funny and relatable, featuring two outstanding lead performances
","At first glance, this second feature from actor-turned-writer/director Greta Gerwig appears to be yet another quirky and twee little indie feature which made the cut as the obligatory low-budget entry into the Best Picture category at this year's Academy Awards. Yet Gerwig wasn't brought in by Noah Baumbach to co-write Frances Ha and Mistress America for nothing. She has a unique voice, and a keen eye for the smaller moments in life that most people didn't realise they had forgotten or missed. Lady Bird is riotously funny, incredibly relatable (for both sexes), and features two incredible lead performances. It's also profoundly authentic, and will have many female viewers (and some male) squirming in their seats as their own awkward memories of adolescence come pouring back.",/review/rw4150004/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2018,jtindahouse,6," I expected more to be honest
","I kind of like films like 'Lady Bird'. Coming of age, teenage dramas where the characters have infinite charm and deal with things we all remember fondly (or not so) from our adolescence. A particularly fond one from recent memory was 'Edge of Seventeen'. I like them as films, but they have to be something truly superb to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. For me 'Lady Bird' was not quite that good.",/review/rw4150004/?ref_=tt_urv

","With one of my favourite trailers of the year, the awards attention, the theme of coming of age and the critical acclaim, 'Lady Bird' very quickly became one of the year's most anticipated films for me. Deliberately didn't see it at opening weekend though, just in case it was busy and difficult to get tickets, after the insane opening weekend of 'Black Panther'. ",/review/rw4150004/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2018,tmpsvita,8," A truly remarkable coming-of-age comedy
","A truly remarkable coming-of-age comedy, above all for its sincere, credible nature and it is not at all easy to be honest and sincere with a film of this kind, for the simple reason that in most cases these ""coming- of-age ""are often filled with clichés, stereotypes and commonplace, and more often than not they base their foundations precisely on these things. In doing so they are not credible and absolutely forgettable.
Well this is not the case.
The merit of an extraordinary script that is impeccably written, it is a mature, intelligent, often ironic, sweet, credible, intense and also very emotional script. 
Greta Gerwig manages this script in a superb way, despite her little experience (this is her second film as a director but first soloist) is extremely aware of the intensity of her film. The interpretations are also particularly notable and not only that of the protagonist, played by the talented Saoirse Ronan that with this role, in which she identifies perfectly, reaches its 3 nominations at the Oscars at only 23 years, it could be called a new Meryl Streep; but also the interpretations of the rest of the cast: from the young and promising Beanie Feldstein, to the most mature, and in this movie is also very good (so much to receive a nomination, the first in her career), Laurie Metcalf, up to two young masculine promises Lucas Hedges and Timothée Chalamet, both discovered only in these two years (the first in 2016 with his performance in ""Manchester by the Sea"" is the second this year with ""Call me by your Name"".
Unfortunately, however, from an extraordinary beginning, extremely ironic, fun, fresh, the film lost itself a little towards the middle, which is a little heavy, and then it recover itself in the final.
Watching it, it came back to me, given their similarity in terms of the theme and the rhythm, another coming-of-age of 2016, ""The Edge of Seventeen"", also an excellent film that unfortunately was relatively forgotten and ignored.",/review/rw4150004/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greta Gerwig, usually disappoints me - as an actress and now in her writing and directorial debut, LADY BIRD, a coming-of-age film about a seventeen-year-old girl growing up in Sacramento ""the Midwest of California"" (the best line in the film,) and the love/hate relationship she has with her working-class family and peers. Social distinctions figure prominently in Gerwig's cinematic world of ""ironic class strivers."" I keep wondering why I am left cold by her words and her characters and eventually understood that LADY BIRD is too self-consciously trying to be inclusive - inclusive of every contemporary issue - touching upon a diversity of characters and situations with momentary episodic flashes.The touch is light, illustrating concerns rather than delving into them, giving us tokenism - glossing over deep pain and longing with a CliffsNotes diminution.",/review/rw4150004/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. Joining the likes of Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and Ben Affleck, Greta Gerwig proves her significance and brilliance is most apparent behind the camera, rather than in front. Her first feature film flying solo as writer and director is without a doubt, one of the year's best. Surely she has benefited from having a very talented live-in muse and mentor and partner in Noah Baumbach, but this extraordinary film is clearly Ms. Gerwig's passion project  and it's a thing of beauty (character warts and all).",/review/rw4150004/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Lady Bird"" is an inspiring film for teenagers and practically the directorial debut the unknown Greta Gerwig, who is also the writer of this sensitive coming of age story. Saoirse Ronan has wonderful performance in the role of Christine 'Lady Bird' McPherson, a teenager with typical adolescent problems. Troubled relationship with her mother and siblings; high-school pranks; romance; sex; disappointments with boyfriends and friends; financial problem; dream on going to college and improving life, all these elements are realistically explored by Greta Gerwig, maybe based on her personal experiences in Sacramento.
