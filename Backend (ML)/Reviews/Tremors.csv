16 October 2002,Infofreak,," Surprisingly enjoyable good old fashioned monster movie!
","On paper I would have expected 'Tremors' to suck - a low budget sci fi action comedy written by the 'Short Circuit' guys, and directed by a hack who went on to make 'City Slickers'. It doesn't exactly inspire confidence, does it? But if you put your prejudices aside you'll find that this is a surprisingly enjoyable good old fashioned monster movie. There is humour here, sure, but thankfully the movie doesn't go for a camp, tongue in cheek parody style, something for me that almost never works. The movies real strength is the perfect casting of Kevin Bacon ('Diner') and Fred Ward ('Henry And June') as the small town handymen turned reluctant heroes. They are supported by the left field but inspired casting of 'Family Ties' Michael Gross and country singer Reba McEntire as a couple of gung ho survivalists. 'Tremors' succeeds in what it sets out to be, an exciting and wonderfully entertaining b-grade horror thriller. A lot of fun and highly recommended.",/review/rw2661591/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2013,SnoopyStyle,8," Great B-movie horror
","A small isolated desert community comes under attack from underground monsters. Valentine McKee (Kevin Bacon) and Earl Bassett (Fred Ward) are two poor handymen. Rhonda LeBeck (Finn Carter) is a seismology student. And the hardcore survivalists Gummers (Michael Gross, Reba McEntire) are just some of the town residents.",/review/rw2661591/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2004,Aaron1375,9," Good cast, good story, good movie.
","Go figure, but this movie was not exactly successful at the box office, I am guessing it made a lot on video however.  It has spawned two sequels and even a television series.  This one though was a fun movie to watch thanks in large part to its cast.  Kevin Bacon is good as the lead and Fred Ward is also very good.  They play a couple of friends living in a very small town in the middle of nowhere.  There only wish is to get out of this place and get somewhere big, unfortunately something big is just under their feet. Seems there are these snake creatures living underground and their going on a killing spree.  They seemed to have chased an old man up a power line where he died of thirst, then they take out a farmer and his livestock, and then they take out these two working on the side of the road.  This movie is rather bloody considering it is a pg-13 movie.  The town meets and we are introduced to more colorful characters like the survivalist couple, the stingy grocery owner, and the annoying kid who loves to play a prank or two. There is also a student there studying seismology or something and everyone turns to her for the answers.  This movie has a lot of comedy and some great scenes and is an all around enjoyable movie.",/review/rw2661591/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2020,Calicodreamin,7," An absolute classic
","Tremors is an absolute classic thriller, pitting the inhabitants of a small podunk town against four giant worms. The cast is well rounded, with Bacon and Ward playing the two unexpected hero's. And Reba? Amazing. The storyline is developed, the acting and dialogue not too cheesy, and the effects great for a movie it's age. Just a good time.",/review/rw2661591/?ref_=tt_urv

1 July 2004,SmileysWorld,8," Excellent homage to 50's B Movie horror flicks
","What we have in this film is the atmosphere of some of the old 50's B movie classics with an 80's touch added,and very well done at that. We have unique and rather intimidating monsters,as well as a very unique cast of characters to battle them.While Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward may be listed as the leads,I think that Michael Gross practically steals the entire show.While it isn't flawless,it certainly is entertaining enough.I would recommend it to any fan of 1950's B horror films.It is well worth the rental and would be a good addition to anyone's library.",/review/rw2661591/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2006,planktonrules,8," Great Hillbilly Sci-fi!!
","I was absolutely shocked when I saw this film, as I really expected it to be a terrible piece of trash. Instead, I was thrilled that the movie had an excellent sense of humor and never took itself seriously--and that is why it was so successful. In many ways, the film was a lot like a traditional 50s sci-fi film about an invasion that the authorities won't believe is taking place--combined with massive amounts of drugs or a head injury to give it a very weird twist! Instead of the typical victims (usually teenagers), the citizens in this Western locale are anything but! Especially the wonderful characters played by Reba McIntire and Michael Gross! They actually seem to COME ALIVE and ENJOY the invasion of these giant killer worms, as it allows them to put their very formidable arsenal to good use!! They are probably better armed than some of our National Guard units! Plus, the others, including Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon, don't just stand there and die or act like idiots from a HALLOWEEN movie, but grab guns and get to work trying to save the planet! This is a movie that really succeeds since it has real attitude and is lots of fun!",/review/rw2661591/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 1999,Op_Prime,," The best movie of 1990
","Tremors is a flawless film. The story is original and entertaining. The actors make it all the more fun, especially Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward and Michael Gross. Tremors is the kind of movie that can't be placed in a certain genre. It's a little bit of everything; horror, comedy, action, adventure, etc. Don't miss this very good movie!",/review/rw2661591/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2016,Quinoa1984,8," a childhood favorite and a not-guilty pleasure
","Tremors was the kind of monster movie that seemed to find its way into my childhood video library - was it meant for kids, I have no idea (it's not not meant for them, if that makes sense) - and it was something that got repeat viewing. I think it was because the tone was sharp for this kind of material. The filmmakers had more of a budget than something like a Japanese Godzilla movie, and the actors, including people like Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward, are not taking a s*** so to speak, they're not there just to collect a paycheck (or if they are, they hide ir so well that you don't notice).",/review/rw2661591/?ref_=tt_urv

31 August 2007,wmjahn,10," The BEST B-movie in the 1985 to 1995 period, if not even longer !
","""Tremors is a flawless film"" wrote another commentator on this site and he's damn right ! What a movie ! I've missed it in the cinema, because over here in Europe, this maybe played in Vienna in 2 theaters for one week and hardly anybody catched it. But some time later, maybe 1992, 1993 it was shown on TV, some midnight cheapie, I thought, but watching it, it scored bullseye, I was glued to the TV-set.",/review/rw2661591/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2005,FairBear,8," Worms! Worms! Underground drag racing worms!
","Loved the movie. How could you not? It has two lovably bumbling buddies, Val and Earl, played to perfection by Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward. It has a remarkably funny gun crazed survivalist couple played completely straight-faced by Michael Gross and Reba McEntire. It has a wonderfully batty bunch of ""townsfolk,"" a winsome heroine and bad lot of underground drag racing worms looking to eat the characters mentioned above. The movie stands out from the ""trapped and pursued"" genre because it contains tongue-in-cheek humor, comedic escapes, inspired foreshadowing of doom and nutty monster mayhem. This is a delightful B monster movie that would best be watched with fellow funny movie buffs, popcorn and beer.",/review/rw2661591/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2005,jotix100,8," Monsters under ground
","Not having seen this enormously pleasing film before, we decided to take a look at it recently. Ron Underwood has done the impossible with the talented people under his direction. He has created a film that takes us back to earlier years when this genre was more popular. It's Mr. Underwood fortune to have been able to get an intelligent script that scares our wits, and at the same time, it gives the viewer ninety minutes of wonderful escape.",/review/rw2661591/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2001,Wez-1,," Has 'cult classic' written all over it.
","This movie caught me by surprise: I worked in a video store, and one day we got a preview tape of this movie, prior to its video release. I hadn't heard much about it, so I watched it, and was quite surprised at how enjoyable it was. Since then, I have seen the movie about ten more times (at least), and still get a kick out of it.",/review/rw2661591/?ref_=tt_urv

11 July 2012,Hey_Sweden,8," It doesn't matter where they come from!
","It's easy to see how the engaging monster movie ""Tremors"" could win over an audience. It's the kind of movie that both gently pokes fun at, and pays homage to, its inspiration. In this case, it's the creature features of the 1950s. Many impressive elements come together to create a successful whole; everything just works here.",/review/rw2661591/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2016,Leofwine_draca,10," Top tier monster comedy is among the best of its kind
","Now, I'm not the world's biggest fan of monster comedies. DEEP RISING left me feeling a little cold, despite the praises of other genre fans, and I absolutely hated LAKE PLACID for its routine, unfunny shtick. However, TREMORS is something different: this cult classic has so far spawned no less than three sequels and a television series, and that stands as a mark of its ensuing popularity. The movie is very funny without trying too hard to be so; much of the humour comes from Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward, who reveal a natural aptitude for comedy, and who are one of the greatest double acts in movie history. Their bumbling, awkward, poorly-educated handymen are gifted creations and account for much of the film's quality.",/review/rw2661591/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2019,socrates4,7," Great Monster Movie
","I'm not a big fan of the genre in general, but this one is great. They really showed just what they can do with the monster flick if they get some good actors and a good script. The old classics were always so corny, and maybe a little charming for that reason I admit. But this has all the charm of those classics and more.",/review/rw2661591/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2002,Agent10,7," Good, stupid fun for the whole family
","Under my current rating system, this ranks as a piece of brilliant stupidity. While the plot and the idea seem really stupid and moribund, the performances and collection of principle actors proved to be an excellent mix, creating a grab bag of humor and suspense. I especially loved Michael Gross and Reba McEntire's performances as the gun toting couple. Kevin Bacon may have a game named after him, but this is one of those little films which proved to be a stirring presentation of the persona he can project. This film was all about good fun, and it delivered.",/review/rw2661591/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," One of the sharpest and funniest monster movies in years!
","I cannot believe how entertained I was by Tremors. As a comedy-horror it succeeds on all levels, that is in my opinion, and it is for me one of the sharpest and funniest monster movies in years. It goes at a tremendously fast pace, it is sharply written being funny and smart and the giant worms are fantastically designed. Add some skillful cinematography, lovely scenery, superb sound effects and an atmospheric score to the mix too, as well as some clever direction and some terrific acting. Fred Ward is charismatic and cool as Earl, and Kevin Bacon is really likable in his role. Rhonda is not the vapid female lead like I feared, she is intelligent and tough, and that was refreshing as was Finn Carter playing her. Out of the number of the entertaining cameos, Michael Gross comes off best as Burt, he was hilarious. Overall, enormous fun and atmospheric, and on a side note the only follow up movie of this movie I've seen so far Tremors 2 I found surprisingly entertaining for a straight-to-video sequel. 10/10 for Tremors.

","Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward play two handymen in a remote desert town, who yearn to get out and into the big city, but it turns out they waited too long, as a mysterious underground monster appears, killing many townspeople and livestock, until our two reluctant heroes team up with Militarist couple Bert Gummer(Amusingly played by Michael Gross) and his wife, played by Reba McEntire.

1 August 2021,Tweetienator,7," Cheesy 'n' Good
","A few days ago I put this little piece on my plate again - and it still works: Tremors is a funny cheesy flick with a solid production and cast. Is it stupid? For sure, but in a good way: recommended for everyone who got still a tender heart for all those trashy 50s monster horror movies and cheesy horror of the 80s.",/review/rw2661591/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2015,g-bodyl,8," A Fun B-Movie!
","Tremors is actually quite a fun B-movie, typical of your usual early-90's flair. It's a film that has something for everybody. It has some good sci-fi action, plenty of comedy thanks to the two bumbling leads, a rather unique and horrific creature design, and this film resembles a mini disaster movie and that is a good thing. I also liked how this film is not flat-out horror. Sure there are some chills, but there is enough action and comedy to combat the horror elements of the film.",/review/rw2661591/?ref_=tt_urv

20 August 2012,drqshadow-reviews,7," Wild, Unapologetically Cheesy, Good Times
","A playful bit of rubber monster schlock from the tail end of the '80s, this is one great big vat of cheese and it makes no efforts to conceal or apologize for that. I can respect that kind of dedication to identity, even if it is grade-school simple and lowbrow, and that's a big part of why the movie's still such a blast to watch today. Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward and Reba McEntire head up a cast that's about as one-dimensional as it gets, flaunting their stereotypes with enthusiasm in the midst of an utterly ridiculous set of circumstances. The premise behind the monsters is original, and the effects actually look pretty solid considering their age, but the concept is pushed to such extremes that there's nothing to do but laugh at the sheer, ballsy idiocy of it all. It's stupid, thin and thoroughly overdone, but just as much dumb, naked fun to watch today as it was when I first caught it at the age of twelve. A gratifying way to senselessly waste ninety minutes of your life.",/review/rw2661591/?ref_=tt_urv
