10 December 2020,nathanmanson,8," Absolutely hilarious
","Ryan gosling had me in tears at times, even Russell Crowe had me laughing. It was hilarious with a good story. I didn't really know what to expect when putting this on because I've never even heard of it, but I'm so glad I found it. Was just a solid film all round, I have absolutely zero complaints or anything negative to say about it.",/review/rw3567084/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2020,henrycoles9,9," Ryan Gosling as a ragdoll
",This was an ecstatics spectacle. Ryan Gosling just keeps falling off and tumbling and walking out unscathed in search of the truth. And the beautiful vibe of 1970s Los Angeles is brought it to perfection.,/review/rw3567084/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm sure this film is going to divide audiences, in the same way that ""Kingsman"" did.",/review/rw3567084/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2016,Lewis_Heather787,9," One of the most surprising films in years!
","For a start i can't believe that I missed this film in the cinema and am I now regretting that decision considering how unbelievably good this film is. The main reason for me to take a look at this film months after it had been in cinemas is the two main leads, Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. Both of which are amazing actors and are just fantastic in there respective roles in the film, they play of one another in the film so well it really shows that both actors genuinely get on with each other. As for other actors they are all great however there is one who in my opinion rises above even Crowe and Gosling and that is the character of Holly March played by Angourie Rice. She is brilliant in every scene she is in whether it be insulting her father or giving advice for a con, this actress has great potential to go on a do great things. Turning our attention away from the cast and to the story and director, both roles which where filled by Shane Black. Once again this very talented director has hit it out of the park, the script is absolutely brilliant and there is never a dull moment in this film. Whether it be the banter between Holland and his daughter or to Jackson the lines that the actors deliver are amazing and perfectly timed, especially Hollands random quotes about Adolf Hitler. As well as the script that Shane Black helped to write the directing in this film is simply unique and brilliantly stylised, it probably really helped Black to write and direct this film. I would like to mention that ""people"" these days say Hollywood isn't making original films anymore and that only franchise films will be made. However a film like The Nice Guys is original and was made and unfortunately from what the box office results are know body bothered to go and see it, I know I'm guilty of that as well. This really makes me sad and it is also sad for this film because it 100% deserves a sequel but will probably never get it. There are some films around that have conned their way to multiple sequels without any of them being any good...divergent..cough.....Finally I would like to say that this film in my opinion is the best of 2016 so far, this film is such a surprise you will not be disappointed if you see it.",/review/rw3567084/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2017,kosmasp,9," Not so nice
","But very good if you are into this kind of stuff. So this is not Kiss Kiss Bang Bang or Last Boy Scout, but it is a new movie by Shane Black, which is a reason to get excited about. If you like weird dialog and situations comedy that he seems to be able to write spot on, then you are in the right place.",/review/rw3567084/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2016,PyroSikTh,8," A Laugh Out Loud Comedy
","The Nice Guys is pretty much a buddy cop comedy, except instead of cops, they're a private investigator and a contract tough guy who find themselves both looking for the same girl, who's gotten herself wrapped up in political and pornographic intrigue. While there are a number of action sequences, The Nice Guys is focused more on delivering humour and jokes based around a couple of reasonably well-developed characters and a mystery that's a little absurd and off- the-wall.",/review/rw3567084/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2016,lasttimeisaw,7," wackily retro and refreshingly nihilistic
","Shane Black's third feature film, after his tent-pole stint in IRON MAN 3 (2013), THE NICE GUYS returns to his home turf L.A. as in his palatable debut KISS KISS BANG BANG (2005). A retro-70s odd-pair comedy couples a stone-faced heavy Jackson Healy (Crowe, sizably ballooned in his physique, whether intentionally or otherwise) and a goofy private eye Holland March (Gosling), who are set to look for a runaway girl Amelia Kutner (Qualley), but soon discover several deaths happened to those who are connected to a porno movie made by Amelia, in defiance of her mother Judith (Basinger), a honcho in the United States Department of Justice.",/review/rw3567084/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2016,zetes,8," A tad disappointing given the fantastic trailers (which spoiled the film a little), but still a lot of fun
","'70s detective movie starring Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, directed by Kiss Kiss Bang Bang's Shane Black. It is a ton of fun. There's definitely something missing that I'm not quite able to put my finger on - it really feels like it should be an all-time classic, but ends up falling short. There's some weaknesses in the script, like Black isn't quite able to make his themes work entirely. It has so much great stuff in it, though. The two leads are ace, both giving near-career best performances. Angourie Rice is also excellent as Gosling's teenage daughter. They do fail to establish a great antagonist, though bad guys Matt Bomer, Keith David and Beau Knapp are all memorable. Others who will remain nameless aren't as good. The film is very funny, thankfully, with Crowe and Gosling bouncing off each other nicely. It is true most of the best bits were given away in the film's two trailers. If you haven't seen them, you might enjoy this even more than I did. I'd definitely recommend it either way.",/review/rw3567084/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2017,SnoopyStyle,8," fun action crime drama
","It's 1977 Los Angeles. Porn actress Misty Mountains crashes into a house and dies. Mrs. Glenn is certain that her niece is alive and hires private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) who starts tracking Amelia. Amelia hires professional muscle Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) to stop her stalker. Jackson breaks Holland's arm assuming resolution to the case. Then, two other thugs break into his place. He partners with Holland and his sassy daughter Holly to save Amelia. In the process, they discover a labyrinthine conspiracy involving a porn movie.",/review/rw3567084/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2020,Holland_March,10," Gosling and Crowe star in one of the most underrated and hilarious
","The Nice Guys is an absolutely fantastic film from beginning to end! Every scene in the movie has at least 3 jokes that will make you belly laugh, and the action is well shot and choreographed. Additionally, Angourie Rice is also great in this flick, as she puts on one of the best performances any child actor has. Did I mention how funny the jokes are? The villains are great as well, even if they are extremely intentionally cliché making them so much better! That aside, the film provides the audience with a genuinely well thought out and well executed mystery. All in all, is this film fantastic? Yes. Is it funny? Absolutely. Should you watch it? DEFINATLY.",/review/rw3567084/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2019,akola-87921,8," Great Cast all brilliant.
","My British/Irish humour puts me at variance with US comedy. This film was funny because of the subtlety and great acting. I rarely like films when a child tags along because often the child behaves with a pretence superior to the adults but in this film the young girl was outstanding and can be taken seriously and believable.
This is one easy to follow adventure with lots of funny bits. The story is not the star, the cast and the way they blend is well done. Rarely do you see a film when the whole cast are brilliant.",/review/rw3567084/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2016,AudioFileZ,5," A Good Pairing Hampered By Weak Script
","I think one either likes this movie quite well or feels like it was a much larger opportunity missed. For this viewer it was the latter. As the movie began I felt it had promise especially because Russell Crowe was likable slug Nick Nolte type and I liked his character. The film has a definite film noir nod, but it's a late 70's period buddy crime flick to be more precise. It does try to inject continuous comedy, but none of it is knee-slapping funny as it's more of a low-key, fairly constant, comedy. ",/review/rw3567084/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2020,Flippo9204,8," Great film
","FINALLY!!
A comedy that tries to tell a story!
As a bonus, it gets told amazingly well.
The cast was also great, but I have to say that Angourie stole the show.
I enjoyed watching it, a lot actually.",/review/rw3567084/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2016,Giacomo_De_Bello,8," 8/10
","Shane Black doing what he excels at the most and doing it at the very best: ""The Nice Guys"" is funny, smart, action packed, violent, irreverent, thrilling and entertaining all at the same time without ever having tonal shift problems, it molds so many elements into one cohesive package that will give you a blast at the cinema and won't alienate you even with the sudden appearance of a giant talking bug in a car.",/review/rw3567084/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2016,cdcrb,5," didn't work for me
","I should have been on high alert when the studio changed the trailer. the second one was better. the story is two guys looking for a missing girl. Russell is a tough guy and Ryan is a detective. I know what the screen writer was going for-laughs-unfortunately these two aren't comedians and can't deliver funny lines. they have absolutely no chemistry together. Ryan has a young daughter who is thrown into the mix, and in many instances the atmosphere is inappropriate for her age group. I guess that is supposed to be funny. I enjoy these guys very much as actors, so I was disappointed. I realize movies are subjective and I notice the 8+ rating. I also noticed that if this is a success there will be a sequel.",/review/rw3567084/?ref_=tt_urv

26 May 2016,cougarfan-bridger,7," The Nice Guys
","I'll admit that I am unfamiliar with most of Shane Black's original works, watching The Nice Guys made me want to go back and take a look at his earlier films. The characters were well written, even better cast, and fit well with the theme of the film. There was rare a dull moment, it seemed I was either enjoying the dark comedic tone, or getting engaged in the plot. While the first two thirds of the film seemed excellent, the writers set themselves up for a fantastic finish, but were unable to capitalize on that potential. The script seemed to suddenly turn very basic, with things ""falling"" into place almost too miraculously to be true. I never felt like I had truly been given an ending worthy of a classic detective story, but the fast pace of the film and humor was enough to make it very enjoyable.",/review/rw3567084/?ref_=tt_urv

15 May 2016,rwicky19,9," Stupidity as an Art of Comedy
","The Nice Guys represents the buddy movie genre at its best. Shane Black is a excellent director and a brilliant writer. He knows how to create hilarious characters and how to put them in absurd scenes — absurd in a comic way. The gags are all unexpected; I was constantly asking myself ""What the hell is going on?"", and then burst into laughter. The plot could seem weird at the beginning, but it's not the main point in this movie, it is only used to create a context to the jokes. People in the theater couldn't stop laughing. There is a new and original joke every two minutes. Russell Crowe plays his part very well, but Ryan Gosling's performance is already cult. All is in the look in his eyes, and that stupid expression on his face. Two stupid and impulsive men in an outrageous world full of porn stars and guns, fighting for...money. And truth, of course. Always the old truth about some kind of conspiracy (the only weakness in the movie). Hopefully, Shane Black doesn't insist too much on that and concentrates himself on the constant jokes. I guarantee you, you will laugh a lot. I know I've just watched an excellent movie when I feel sad during the credits, because it's already over. And then, it's just pure happiness.",/review/rw3567084/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2016,writers_reign,5," And A - Way We Go
","Having, for reasons best known to himself, allowed his weight to balloon to Jackie Gleason proportions and contriving to resemble him facially, Russell Crowe elects to give us his Ralph Kramden crossed with Papa's Delicate Condition. It starts off very ho-hum with both leads somewhat at sea but gradually it becomes more watchable especially whenever Angouri Rice is on screen and effortlessly stealing every scene that isn't nailed down and even those that are. There's a passing nod to Chinatown in the idea of corrupt business interests albeit the main thrust appears to be an attempt to bring off a buddy-buddy movie that is only partially successful. Overall it's a passable diversion if light- years short of others in the genre.",/review/rw3567084/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2016,dierregi,3," Starts as buddy movie then derails into a patchwork of clichés
","Crowe and Gosling play PIs with different personalities forced to work together. Not groundbreaking territory, but suitable for lighthearted entertainment. Unfortunately, what starts as a drama set in Los Angels in the late 70s, soon turns into a weird mix of Boogie Nights and Taxi Driver, minus the darkness of those two movies - but missing also their greatness.",/review/rw3567084/?ref_=tt_urv
