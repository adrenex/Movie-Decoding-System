3 December 2020,mikejade,3," Gone downhill big time
",December 2020 - Crime show gone to the dogs. The story is more drama and personal interaction with little actual crime. They take turns doing their acting. Plot holes abound. Question. Who wants to watch a show about COVID19,/review/rw6957987/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2021,jodee143,4," Succeed without Lucas Black?
","Like the show and I like this NCIS the most out of all of them. Yet, I'm really missing the character played by Lucas Black. He is charismatic on screen. A joy to watch. Scott Bakula can't carry this show with CCH. CCH is stronger and much more likable scene stealer.",/review/rw6957987/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2020,mafdenver,3," So awful I just can't watch anymore
","Have you noticed they read their lines as if half the sentence is on a cue card and they need to wait for the next card to come up? Do you think of Joey Tribiani doing math in his head when they try to act? It's not often I dislike characters more than the WACKY! tech guy but in this lame NCIS outing, he's the least annoying. The girl with the pouty big lips as the token hot latina and the little fire plug as the token sassy black girl - how are people not up in arms over the nasty stereotyping? Those two girls gripe at every single sentence. It's truly cringe-inducing to watch them.",/review/rw6957987/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2014,face-819-933726,9," The right kind of show at the right time. History has made this possible.
","I really was glad to see this show, so I am going to have to keep focused on the review, and not the ""Fan boy crap"". I will get right to it, NCIS has been a solid show in the top 5 since it was first launched, and the LA version has done well with the older crowds, but there has been a lack of real darkness, and this will be the right place to look for the darkest of dark, to be more like Criminal Minds. The Bijou the swamps, and the Parishes are always fun for those of us who only go there to party, and with the success of True Detective this year this show was a forgone conclusion. Now the cast is extremely robust, packed tight with real acting heavy weights, Everyone loves Scott Bakula, and Lucas Black the kid from Sling Blade has never had a bad performance, though he has never been anyone beyond the Alabama boy that he is. CCH Pounder was the conscience of The Shield, so she will be a great Coroner. So far what they have shown us is quality, and that CBS is giving them the room they need to make quality drama. If you like NCIS, or Criminal Minds, then you will be hooked on this one as fast as you can smell the bait. This is the right time for a show of this kind to be on network TV, don't expect any language, but there should still be some nice edge.",/review/rw6957987/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2014,household137,6," Review of NCIS New Orleans
","As a New Orleans native I implore you and the writers to walk down any street in New Orleans and talk to a LOCAL. We DO NOT eat shrimp and grits for breakfast and praline bacon isn't in our fridge. We have worked very hard to come back from Katrina and it PAINS ME that this series (which I love and watch regularly) is making us look like uneducated loud mouth pigs. Please - come uptown and take a census of LOCALS, have a LOCAL help you with the dialect!! We DO NOT talk like that unless your're from Mississippi. PLEASE! I LOVE my city and would LOVE for the series to continue and for us New Orleanians to sound like the intelligent up and coming tech community that we are! Thank you!",/review/rw6957987/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2018,ravenhair702,8," so tired of people leaving this show...!
","Today is April 3rd and tonight is Shalita Grants last show on NCIS. She took over after Zoe McLellan left the show after season 2! Can ANYONE get a 5 year contract on this show? Just when you get used to a character, they leave! Really tired of it. Don't get me wrong...this is one of my favorite shows, but come ON! I really wanted Lasalle and Percy to get together. They had chemistry. I wonder who is going to take her place on the show and I'm setting the clock when she or he becomes an agent. I give them two years...tops! I just hope that the show makes them a good deal not to quit for at least 5 years. It's just not good for a show if they have people constantly leaving. I looked Google as soon as I watched the last part of tonight's episode. It stated it was a ""Mutual agreement"" Oh horse crap. I looked up McLellan's reason and it said ""Creative differences"" That means She wanted more money and they said no. Tired of it, folks. TIRED of it.",/review/rw6957987/?ref_=tt_urv

25 March 2014,mitchellhaleyou,10," Bellisario Does it Again. NCIS New Orleans is spectacular.
",Donald P. Bellisario does it again. Beautifully done. NCIS New Orleans makes me want to watch and see what happens next. Nice introduction and expansion of new characters as well as the expansion of existing known characters. As always doesn't disappoint with the history of characters and their development within the NCIS. I think this show displays only the best in screen writing. NCIS New Orleans really expands and broadens character area and ext. screenwriter's aspect. NCIS New Orleans is so worth any high budget external location filming endeavor. Brings us back int. to what we expect and know out of existing locations and characters. NCIS New Orleans also is developing a pretty awesome int. view aspect of a NCIS New Orleans office. While I have no idea of future intent of the producers; I'm hopeful the producers expand this show to an NCIS New Orleans full season. I want to see more.,/review/rw6957987/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2014,maverick-zenica,1," ooo myy gooddd
","where to begin...hmmmi normally I don't write reviews , but this time i had to do it , cause we are talking about NCIS people !! i am a huge fan of NCIS series, but this one i will for sure skip.. Acting was so lame,i was almost falling a sleep during the show..{jazz New Orleans, and Scott Bakula ( for gods sake CPT Archer you can do better than this} Lets make some comparison to NCIS /NCIS LA...even on a boring episodes ..they make me smile , with one liners, or Gibbs slap on the head , Dinozzos film references,Hetty's crap , Hanna, G , Deeks ,Abby , Mc Geek en rest .. I really really was hoping for more from the pilot ... The pilot is there the crucial point where u catch the audience, make us wait for next episode , keep me on the edge , and not make me watch bedtime story ... I give it 2 * only cause i am {was} a fan of Capt Archer....",/review/rw6957987/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2014,frebo3,5," Where are we?
","Sad to say, as a fan of both NCIS and the charm and culture and cuisine of N'awlins, I'm VERY disappointed in NCIS New Orleans. I'll admit my opinion is biased by the 11 years I spent in the military, which gives me certain expectations about organizations like NCIS or Army CID, where they work, and the people - civilian and military - that work there. I have two major problems with both NCIS NO and NCIS LA. First, there is no sense of ""place"" in NCIS NO or NCIS LA. NCIS HQ in Virginia is a well defined brick building, and Gibb's house is Gibb's house. The NCIS (Virginia) office space is a well-defined ""bull pen"" with dividers, and team members have assigned space in a realistic office setting. There is an elevator between lower levels of the building (Abby's lab and Duckie's domain,) Gibb's team space, and the Director's office. There is a video teleconference room, an interrogation room, and other realistic looking work spaces. I almost believe I could show people around the building - BUT in both NCIS LA and NO - there is no clearly defined team work space that looks like anything I've ever seen in a military organization - people wander about giant lofts or industrial sets with no evident connection to their work - to include the Navy O-6 (Captain) commanding USN operations in the city! Does Pride offer breakfast to his team in his office (an industrial loft) or his residence (also an industrial loft?)I just can't suspend that much disbelief. Is there a kitchen in the office or does he hold team meetings at home? Quien sabe? They might as well be on the Good Ship Lollipop. The second problem is, Gibbs as Special Agent in Charge has set the bar VERY high. From the very first episode, the guy exuded ""command presence,"" as does Rocky Carroll as Director Vance. Nobody on either NCIS LA or NO has that quality - and if it's not demonstrated at the onset of a command relationship, it's unlikely to emerge later. Again, I just can't suspend enough disbelief to take either of the spin-offs seriously - but I LOVE the old original NCIS (with a few minor reservations.) Aside from these issues, the NCIS N.O.production values are excellent - but the plot twists in the opening episode created another challenging level of disbelief based on improbable coincidences among the victim, the NCIS team, and the perpetrator. Sayonara, NCIS N.O.!",/review/rw6957987/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2014,lukebearone,3," Pitiful extension of the NCIS franchise!
","This series, in the opinion of a huge fan of NCIS and NCIS: Los Angeles, is simply pitiful. The writing, especially in the pilot and the first two episodes, is weak and puerile, so weak is the plot line and dialog, that they felt it necessary early on to drag in Mark Harmon, Michael Weatherley, Pauley Perrette , David McCallum and Rocky Carroll to prop up far-fetched story lines, like a Baton Rouge doctor starting an epidemic of bubonic plague. And their presence didn't help at all! As a New Orleanian I rapidly grow tired of Scott Bakula's character's constant references to Hurricane Katrina and how this ""great city"" has suffered enough. The audience has suffered enough already! The entire premise for this show is weak from the git-go -- I am sure that the Navy Department has more important cities which have NCIS departments that could be a better basis for a series than this decrepit river town of less than 400,000 residents. I give it barely 3 stars, out of a sense of compassion to all involved.",/review/rw6957987/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2018,fannyvanelewijck,10," Love it!
","I loved ncis from the start. 
It felt natural to love this one too.
I like all actors. Scott Bakula is great,CCH Pounder had this presence in every scene that I just love. She brings balance in everything whenever there is an unbalance of emotions, or need of wisdom or good advice...(Like Yoda).
Everything and everyone is so wel brought to life. Too bad that Belgium is a bit behind on the seasons.",/review/rw6957987/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2020,dastr,1," Getting worse and worse.
","I've about stopped watching it. Bad enough that way back at the end of season 2, they got rid of Brodie. Big mistake. Then later, they get rid of Sonja, another mistake, I understand Lucas Black leaving for personal reasons.
But then you've tried to turn that Lab Monkey into a field agent. Hahahahahaha. He's no more believable as a field agent than my 80 year old invalid mother. In fact, she'd be more believable. Giving him new glasses and a beard doesn't turn a monkey into something he's not. His role is now a HUGE mistake.
You should've brought in a replacement for Lucas, instead of trying to turn a sow's ear into a silk purse.
So, it's reached the point I can't watch it anymore. Too ludicrous!
You want to save this show, put the lab monkey back where he belongs, and bring in a replacement for Lucas Black's character. Somebody that would actually be a field agent.
Although, your show is now a great comedy, unintended as that was ,",/review/rw6957987/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2015,ceiag,2," Soooo disappointed
","I knew that there was going to be (is) a NO spin off, but I was so dreadfully disappointed in this. I have just watched the two-part launch in series 11 of NCIS, and the only character who was believable was the wonderful CCH Pounder. The characterisation and sympathetic background was laid on with a trowel. You need to allow characters to develop, to grow up, not be born complete. The parallels stretched the audience's tolerance (the Abbi, the Ducky (although, as I said, CCH was great), the new girl...)and insult their intelligence. And even in England, we appreciate what New Orleans went through with Katrina, but to mention several times how much these characters had done or suffered because of it, in the opening of a series, belittles the genuine suffering of the people of that iconic city. I am sorry if I have offended anyone, but this was so disappointing, I cannot help but say so.",/review/rw6957987/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2020,nims-1975,1," Too Soft, No Intensity, Awful Acting, Pure Crap
","NCIS: New Orleans is an absolutely crap US TV Cop Show which doesn't deserve 1/10 it deserves 0/10 because it is just lame, weak and just absolutely crap. The acting in this US TV Cop Show is awful and so are the characters. The characters are too soft and are not as strong or powerful as the characters in NCIS: Los Angeles are. Lucas Blacks acting as cop Christopher is also awful, he also is too soft and so are the other cops. They are not at all physically or emotionally strong as Sam Hanna(played by LL Cool J), G. Callen(played by Chris O'Donnell), Kensi Blye(played by Daniela Ruah), Marty Deeks(played by Eric Christian Olson) are in NCIS: Los Angeles.
