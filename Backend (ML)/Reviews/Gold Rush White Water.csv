1 December 2002,basrutten,," Very interesting
","Along with ""X-Files"" and ""E.R."", this is one of the very few TV series that has consistently been able to keep my attention for more than a couple of episodes. The combination of good acting, nice storylines and intriguing court cases makes this series very interesting to watch.",/review/rw8361622/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 1999,Scream-11,," Missing this show should be a crime
","The Practice is the only show on television that never fails to make me reconsider my views on some of the controversial issues in society today. The writing is the best I've ever seen on television, and I love the characters, but the best thing about the show is that it deals creatively with important topics, like euthanasia and attorney/client privilege.  As long as The Practice continues to take my breath away every week, I will be a devoted fan.",/review/rw8361622/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2001,jaspervanzyl,," ""Riveting, Life-Changing, A Triumph!""
","The Practice is a magnificent triumph created by one the most ingenious masterminds of the nineties, David E. Kelley. The Practice features the most incredible cast that a law series could hope for. My first impression was: ""There is no way that these people aren't real lawyers, I mean, it's just not possible!"" Dylan McDermott is fantastic as Bobby Donnell, Steve Harris riveting as Eugene Young, The beautiful Kelli Williams is exquisite as Lindsey Dole, and the rest of the cast (leading and guest) doesn't fall far behind.",/review/rw8361622/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2002,raysond,," One of the best series on TV
","If you're not watching ""The Practice"",you're missing out! Don't sleep on it. One of the best series ever devised for television and it shows. This is one of the most riveting shows around today and for good reason. The actors are first rate,the writing is astounding,and the production is brilliant. What other show can topped it? None. Riveting courtroom drama at its very best. Not since ""Perry Mason"" has a show held its audience captive and keeps them in suspense until the last minute. This series ranks up there with David E. Kelley's ""Boston Public"",Dick Wolf's ""Law and Order"",and John Wells' medical drama ""ER"",and the paramedic drama ""Third Watch"".  Kudos to all!!!  Catch it Sundays on ABC-TV,and weeknights on FX.",/review/rw8361622/?ref_=tt_urv

","From 1997 to 2000, this was one of the best shows on TV. The interplay between the actors was topnotch; the show was involving, often both intense and funny within the same episode, and the large but extremely talented cast interacted to create some brilliant TV. These '97-'00 episodes are highly recommended, and fortunately they are in syndication on cable.",/review/rw8361622/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2005,plkcsk,," The Practice NEEDS to be on DVD !!!
","Please - When are all 8 series of that fantastic programme, THE PRACTICE, going to be released on DVD?? When? When? When? For those who do not know the series, the following is a summary: Set in Boston, The Practice centres on a firm of passionate attorneys to whom every case is important and every client worth a fight to the end. Legal manipulations are the firm's modus operandi, and they have it down to a science, making even the most questionable arguments convincing. And while they can't  and don't  win every trial, the pursuit of justice remains the priority until the final verdict is announced  and sometimes afterwards. Pursuing justice, however, often confronts them with serious ethical and moral issues of conscience. But please - when is it coming out on DVD??",/review/rw8361622/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2016,safenoe,10," The best - not all the good guys win but some of the bad guys do
","TV legal dramas aren't documentaries, and they're not supposed to be (of course), but if there's one series that comes close to reflecting real life practice, it has to be The Practice.",/review/rw8361622/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2015,AlsExGal,8," A great legal drama in the David E. Kelley tradition
","This show was a fine example of successfully mixing torts with the titillating with a good balance that has eluded so many other courtroom dramas over the years. The premise of the show is that Bobby Donnell is the head of a law firm that is barely managing to keep itself financially afloat due to the kinds of cases that the firm takes and the fact that they have trouble collecting their fees from more than a few of their clients. However, these lawyers are the kind of people you would always want on your side. They have a can-do attitude and seem to relish an uphill fight. In fact, at several points in the show, they remind one another that the reason they took on the uncertainty and lesser remuneration of starting their own law firm was so that they could choose their battles rather than work for a big firm where the price of financial safety would be representing big corporate clients, right or wrong. Although this show has a large sexual component, it has several average looking and even outright plain looking folk as regular castmembers. Furthermore, these average looking people, with more than their share of physical flaws, are actually given meaningful personal lives. Creator David E. Kelley actually wrote five of the first six episodes of the first season, and it shows in the performances. Unlike many shows where the characters struggle to figure out who they are, these actors and actresses have their personalities down pat with their opening lines.",/review/rw8361622/?ref_=tt_urv

18 May 2004,jellyneckr,," Overall a great show!
","The series finale of THE PRACTICE aired Sunday night and although I have only watched the show a few times during its last season, I'd say the last season was the best season. The finale season had some of the strongest episodes in the show's history. James Spader really saved the show. For a few years, the show was really lacking and was really falling apart, but once James Spader was brought onto the show, it became better than ever. The show was on for a good seven years and while it probably should have been canceled a couple year ago, I'm glad it stayed on as long as it did. Overall, it was a great show, mainly thanks to the interesting story lines. I'm looking forward to the spin-off that is supposed to start this fall.",/review/rw8361622/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have seen David E. Kelley's other shows. Ally is OK. Picket Fences was good. Chicago Hope was OK. And now the Practice. The Practice is without question the greatest show put together through 6 seasons. I am dissapointed with season 7 (2002-2003) but the show has shocked me before, and I am not giving up.",/review/rw8361622/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2003,westpac,," different take on the law
","""The Practice"" is unique among lawyer shows focusing on the defense side of the table in that virtually all of their clients are guilty and they're defending them not because of any social injustice but because that's what defense attorneys do. In the early seasons Lindsey was on retainer to a drug lord and her character was almost predatory. It was refreshing to see attorneys who knew their clients were guilty as hell and spent their time trying to get evidence suppressed and ruthlessly attack witnesses (including a rape victim) to obtain reasonable doubt.",/review/rw8361622/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2010,Jetset971,8," One season too long.
","I would have given ""The Practice"" a 10 out of 10 or at least a nine out of ten except for one thing, the last season. First let me talk about the good aspects of this show. Top notch cast and writing, excellent direction, crisp story lines and editing all combine together to make this an exceptional lawyer show. I really enjoyed the complex nature of the show as these professional lawyers struggle with ethical challenges that come with defending unscrupulous and deplorable clients. Yes, at times it got a little over used, but for the most part it enhanced the show immensely. For seven seasons I watch and admired this show for its daring bravado. However, in the last season they made a critical error, one that should be a cautionary tale to all television executives and producers. For whatever reason, contract disputes or orders from the top, the cast was literally gutted. Half of the top regulars, Bobby, Lindsey, Rebecca, and even Helen Gamble left the show. This had disastrous consequences. The remaining players did their best but this show was damaged beyond repair. To be fair, the introduction of James Spader as the silky snake attorney, Alan Shore, was a very welcome addition. Thankfully he was spun off to ""Boston Legal"". Still, he was not enough to salvage the rest of the show and it was just painful to watch the demise. Why do producers and directors of hit shows always squeeze the last drop out a show, when they know they should end it while its on top or at least not far from its prime? It is frustrating as all get out to me that they don't realize the obvious. Since they don't seem to even know what the word ""obvious"" means here is a list.(These are just a few. Go to ""Jump the Shark"" for a more complete list.)",/review/rw8361622/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2005,policy134,," The third time David E. Kelley has done a law show and it still works.
","David E. Kelley was of course a major asset for L.A. Law because of his experience as a lawyer. Therefore, he had an insider's knowledge and his scripts were also considered the show's best. Here we get basically the same premise but instead of focusing on wealthy lawyers from the West, we get blue collar lawyers (if such a thing exists) from the east. The sunny atmosphere of L.A. Law has been darkened considerably and I think that every single character has some kind of depressive side to them. That makes it hard to even think of them as the good guys, also because of the questionable clients they represent.",/review/rw8361622/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2020,safirecharmed,10," A roller coaster ride of emotions
","This is a compelling show featuring many different personalities that somehow come together for one reason: goodness and the law. Some days you were disgusted with the despicable acts that were happening on the show and other days they redeemed themselves. The last season they lost what made the show so wonderful and I'm not talking about the characters. Alan Shore was a detriment to the show. He was an interesting guy and funny but he had no moral standing. He made everything sarcastic in a humorless way. Of course it was hard to lose several main characters but keeping Jimmy, Eugene, and Eleanor really helped. It's only sad the adding Alan sure and Tara ended up making the show horrible in the end.",/review/rw8361622/?ref_=tt_urv
