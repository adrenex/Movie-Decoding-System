20 July 2018,CountJonnie,8," Brilliant and motivating
","Ben Stiller is Walter Mitty, a man who looks as if he does nothing, is nothing and is perceived as nothing. Except for during his little fantasies in which he is a hero, but during these weirds moments in which he dozes off, others write him off.",/review/rw2929284/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2014,kosmasp,9," So many great moments
","Actually just one of them would make me want to give this a 10/10 and it is very close in my eyes. The scene I'm talking about involves a helicopter and a song that really got under my skin. If you don't feel a thing during that scene ... well I don't know what to say. The whole thing is build upon feelings and dreams. Obviously breaking out of them and making some of it reality (not the ones that can not be achieved obviously, like flying or other stuff) is the ultimate goal.",/review/rw2929284/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2014,Horst_In_Translation,8," Succeeds not exactly for realism, but has huge emotional impact from start to finish
","""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" includes a truly uplifting story and gives a push to everybody to live through their dreams instead of dreaming through their lives. If I had to pick my favorite component of the film, I'd probably go with the writing. However, I have to say that I also liked most of the performances. Stiller made a good job as the lead and so did Wiig. Adam Scott (""Parks and Recreation"") was a good choice for the main antagonist to Mitty and he made slick really work. He really nailed his scenes, also the condescending way in which he treated the dreamer Walter Mitty.",/review/rw2929284/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2019,thatgirlmyra-9946,9," An Uplifting Escape
","This movie was something I really related to. It shows a man who is perceived as nothing important and wants to change that. This movie could easily inspire anyone, and it's such a wonderful change from the typical sad and action filled movies now. I just love this movie and would highly recommend it.",/review/rw2929284/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2015,classicsoncall,8," ""Stay gold, Pony Boy!""
","This movie started out slow for me and was starting to get a bit tedious with Ben Stiller's portrayal of the title character, but the Greenland/Iceland trip managed to win me over. Kristen Wiig's take on Bowie's ""Space Odyssey"" was what was needed to add some poignancy to Walter Mitty's (Stiller) quest to discover himself, find adventure, and win over the unattainable love of his life.",/review/rw2929284/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2014,CalRhys,," An Utterly Mesmerising Spectacle
","'Tropic Thunder', 'The Cable Guy', 'Zoolander'... Ben Stiller has created some entertaining comedies, but 'Walter Mitty' is by far his most audacious piece of direction so far. The story is solid and the cinematography is stunning, Stiller has created an utterly mesmerising spectacle that follows the same basis of the 1947 classic starring Danny Kaye. Whilst I found the majority of the film charming and entertaining, it's the beautiful cinematography from Stuart Dryburgh that really sells this flick, and in my opinion should have been worthy of an Oscar- nomination at the least. One of the most entertaining comedy-dramas I have seen in recent years, a film that Stiller should be proud of.",/review/rw2929284/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2014,TxMike,," A really fine movie, Stiller and Wiig in non-comedic roles.
","I am not a big Ben Stiller fan, but I DO enjoy many of his movies. With that as background, I went into watching this one with a bit of apprehension, but overall I found this to be one of the better movies I have seen recently. And I see about 250 a year.",/review/rw2929284/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2015,filmfanperspective,8," In a busy world, Walter Mitty is our spirit animal (****)
","It might be difficult for choosy audiences with cynical dispositions, but if we can look past the pesky product placement in ""The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty"", we're left with one very, very good film. Ben Stiller, who usually seems to have little clue how to use his specific talents, gives his best performance to date in front of and behind the camera. This is a film that may not resemble the source material verbatim, but the spirit is clearly alive, with a few touches to modernize the idea. As a whole, it's a sweet, confident, and poignant film that has a lot to say, but I think it speaks only to those willing to listen.",/review/rw2929284/?ref_=tt_urv

","In Afghanistan on the snow covered Himalayan Mountains grizzled and world wise Sean O'Connell played by Sean Penn gazes at his coveted photo moment. Sean says that all he wants is to be ""in the moment"". Sean Penn is selfless gravitas in this moment as he confides in Ben Stiller's exasperated mild mannered Walter Mitty, who literally travels to the ends of the earth to track down the maverick old-school legendary photographer. Be in the moment and be present in life--are the eloquently poignant lyrics of Director Ben Stiller's ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"". ",/review/rw2929284/?ref_=tt_urv

21 September 2018,cricketbat,8," Inspiring and creative
","The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is inspiring and creative, and I appreciate creativity and being inspired. The exotic settings and the unique soundtrack enhance the viewing experience. I do feel like it should have been funnier, though. I don't know if it will hold up during subsequent viewings, but this movie is an entertaining ride the first time through.",/review/rw2929284/?ref_=tt_urv

","My first watch in the cinema was ok, but somehow I was expecting more, what exactly, I'm not so sure. 2nd watch without the expectations was much better. 3rd watch and I now think this is an exceptional film, good story line, strong performances, the scenery, the soundtrack, it's like Indiana Jones decided to become the lead singer of The Strokes or something like that, nuts I know. A solid 8/10.",/review/rw2929284/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2018,ellinmara,10," A film (not only but especially) for all daydreamers, searchers for meaning in life, and eccentrics...
","I am a fan of many fandoms and have seen many films which include elements of or are about fantasy, dreams, and/or imagination. But ever since The Secret Life of Walter Mitty came out, it has been my favorite film of all times. I can't quite say why this film appeals to me to such an extent. I suppose because I myself have spent a lot of time daydreaming about all kinds of stuff, and have, at times, felt a bit out of place in the world we live in. What I have found most enchanting about this film is just how very ordinary and relatable Walter Mitty is. And then he stumbles into this odd adventure... but it's not just your ordinary hero-on-quest, great-adventure story. It is so much deeper than that. Please watch this film! You won't regret it!",/review/rw2929284/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2015,RNMorton,10," Very very rewatchable
","I didn't get the original Secret Life of Walter Mitty and Danny Kaye always made me uncomfortable. This is a much different remake about a photography processing expert at the to-be-revamped Life Magazine who has to locate the negative for the shot which will cover the last published edition of the magazine. Ben Stiller is usually very accessible as an actor, we can get into his head and relate to his predicaments and his solutions. That is never more true than in this movie, maybe because Ben also directs as well as stars. Kristen Wiig is also fine in an understated manner as the girl Ben would like to get to know better. Some of the fantasy sequences (Walter has a penchant for day dreams, often at the wrong time) were a little hard to follow. But some of them worked grandly, particularly Wiig's acoustic rendition of Space Oddity at the Greenland bar, which is a magical and pivotal moment in the movie. There are many breathtaking panoramas of the places visited by Mitty, mostly filmed on location in Iceland. Each time I see this it grows a little more on me, and the enchanting musical score compliments things very well. This sort of has to be taken on its own terms but on those terms it is a very very nice work.",/review/rw2929284/?ref_=tt_urv

","I saw an advanced screening of ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" last night. To the right person, this movie is life-changing, life-affirming, and truly beautiful. No, the narrative isn't perfect. The script isn't perfect. There are narrative flaws and stretches of the imagination, but this movie is about stretching the imagination.",/review/rw2929284/?ref_=tt_urv

","One really has to wonder what the professional reviewers are really thinking. We looked over the family movie list and barely decided to go to this one based on lackluster reviews. Six out of six of us REALLY liked it and found it deep and entertaining, and easy to watch. By all means, if you are looking to enjoy a movie, go see this one.",/review/rw2929284/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2013,BharatSamra,9," Two Hours of Fantasy That Has Something to Say About Reality
","Loosely based on the 1939 short story by James Thurber, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty explores the idyllic fantasies of its titular protagonist, as he attempts to escape the mundane motions of his daily routine employment at Life Magazine. When Mitty (Ben Stiller) discovers that photojournalist Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) has misplaced negative 25, intended for the cover of the final print of the publication, he sets out on a larger-than-Life journey to locate the missing photograph, while reducing his need for daydreams as he discovers that not even his wildest fantasies are a match for an adventurous reality.",/review/rw2929284/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2014,tavm,7," Ben Stiller's version of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was enjoyable enough for me
","Before I review the movie proper, let me just say that I'm familiar with both the original James Thurber short story and the Danny Kaye feature movie version. I think I remember liking both good enough but it's been awhile since I read the former or seen the latter. I did like this version starring and directed by Ben Stiller. When he's daydreaming, I managed to laugh heartily at most of them and when he's experiencing his real-life adventures, I marveled at how he's experiencing something he'll probably never do again but will now have tales to tell to future friends or family members. And Kristen Wiig does well in a more straight role that's much different from her more familiar cartoonish parts, like her recent turn in Anchorman 2, and has the same awkward vibe that matches well with Stiller's character. I also loved her singing of that David Bowie song in one of Mitty's dreams. My movie theatre-working friend thought the whole thing may have been too weird for his tastes but I liked it fine and wouldn't mind seeing it again. So on that note, I recommend this version of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.",/review/rw2929284/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have given this a ""10"" rating. There was one minor issue I had with the movie that would make it not quite that in my mind, but a ""9"" rating would be an injustice to this extraordinary film and, since I'm unable to give it a 9.75 or something like that, ""10"" it is.

","For those who remember the Sam Goldwyn film on The Secret Life Of Walter
Mitty you will find this new version nothing like it. Ben Stiller got some laughs
in for sure, but his general treatment of the classic James Thurber story is far
different than the one that starred Danny Kaye back in the day. Goldwyn and

27 December 2013,nancy-330-878904,10," Outstanding
","I expected this to be funny and perhaps a little goofy. What it is is a breathtaking work of art. This is Ben Stiller at his best. The movie is just wonderful. It's funny, thought provoking, touching at times and startling at others. It's entertaining throughout. The pace may seem slow at times to those used to action packed films, but I personally don't care for nonstop technically enhanced action scenes for no apparent reason. I've been hoping people would tire of those for some time now, so we can get back to good stories again. This was a great story, loosely based on the original short story by James Thurber. I wish there were more movies out there like this. That would definitely get me back into movie theaters. As well...the acting was superb all around. Kristen Wiig was outstanding--as usual. I think this may be her best work as well.",/review/rw2929284/?ref_=tt_urv
