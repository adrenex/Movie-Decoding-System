5 November 2021,Supermanfan-13,9," The early seasons were great, not so much lately!
",Billions is such a terrific show that takes place in the financial world but you don't need to know much about that world to enjoy the show! Even though it hasn't been as good the last few seasons it's still a pretty good show and gets a high rating from me because those early seasons were just that good. Damian Lewis and Paul Giamatti lead an amazing cast that are all at the top of their game here!,/review/rw4744045/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Fantastic (especially the first few seasons)!
","Billions is such a terrific show that takes place in the financial world but you don't need to know much about that world to enjoy it! It tells the story of billionaire hedge fund Kong, Bobby Axelrod (Damian Lewis) and his fight against a U. S. attorney named Chuck Rhoades (Paul Giamatti). He tried to build a case against Axelrod but Axelrod keeps getting away with what he's doing. What makes them even more at odds is Axelrod employs Rhoades wife, psychiatrist Wendy Rhoades. She refuses to give up her career for her husbands crusade. Both men try to outmaneuver the other. Even though it hasn't been as good the last few seasons it's still a pretty good show and gets a high rating from me because of those early seasons. Lewis and Giamatti lead a amazing cast that are all at the top of their game here!",/review/rw4744045/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2022,Homer_Ate2,7," Season 6, I'm done.
","Season 1 - 4 were great. 5 however started to loose me. 6 was a total washout. Prince was a terrible protagonist, no match for Chuck, only was at times because the script said so.",/review/rw4744045/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2019,foghorn_clj,5," It was great... Until it wasn't.
",Season 1 and 2. Great. Fantastic. Had me on the edge of my seat. Season 3. Boring drivel.,/review/rw4744045/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2022,ammypearson,4," Used to be the best show in tv
",Billions used to be the best show on TV. It was groundbreaking and exciting and witty and incredible. But now it is just woke garbage. It has gone downhill in the past few years. I try to give it another chance even though Damian Lewis left but it is practically unwatchable now.,/review/rw4744045/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2022,cparousis-30615,2," Season 6: No Axe, No Bueno...
","Wow, the show without Axe is weak sauce. The Michael Prince in the Axe role character doesn't work. There isn't that bite to the show like in the previous five seasons. The characters don't gel without Axe. Axe was the show. This will be the last season, IMO....",/review/rw4744045/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2022,dzeilstra,8," Another series that should have stopped
","Billions was a great show with great actors. Up to and including the first 5 seasons I really enjoyed it. But as it often goes, the makers can't get enough of their success and just keep going on. Until the momentum, the excitement and the spirit is gone. This is also largely due to Season 6 being without main actor Damian Lewis. So I watched one episode but it did not get me hooked and after reading some other reviews I thought it best to leave it at that and watch something else instead.",/review/rw4744045/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2019,bsloughrin,1," Season 4
","Boy, how far can you fall. They have destroyed the characters, they have turned the story in to a caricature of what it was. Not worthy of 10 minutes of your time.",/review/rw4744045/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2019,bsloughrin,1," What was once a 10 Star Show
","First couple of seasons this was brilliant, riveting, and fun. :Last season not so much. This season is one hackneyed cardboard stereotype after another tied together more so many cliches it is clear the script was created by AI. And to top it off some the finest actors of the past 40 years have been given the opportunity to deliver such nonsense that their performances will easily rank among their worst.
It's a sad shame.",/review/rw4744045/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2019,markbradfordupvc,2," How the mighty have fallen
","The first two series of this show was something completely different , you were brought into the exciting life of a billionaire playboy called Bobby Axlerod (played by Damien Lewis )that owns a hedge fund company. You saw how he makes his millions buys his sports cars and lives in a mansion in the Hamptons. However series 3 started to get stale with lots of annoying characters the main one been Taylor mason played by Asia Kate dillion.
What keeps the show going is Bobby axelrods shady dealings and his stand offs with Chuck Rhodes played by Paul Giamatti a US attorney. The problems started in series 3 most of the story lines are in Bobby's offices we rarely see he home ,it's all about share dealings.
I tried to get into series 4 but the script is weak ,boring and seems to have been written by 18 year olds. I am currently watching episode 10 I can't imagine I will watch another episode it's too irrating",/review/rw4744045/?ref_=tt_urv

1 June 2020,crescendo_1,3," The Plunging Stock
",There's just so much cringe and pandering that one can take. After an interesting first season this series is heading towards the same fate as the House Of Cards or Game of Thrones final season. Although it was never as good as those shows from the start. The characters have devolved so much by this time that one can't even call them one dimension. It stinks of wokeness and butt-hurt revenge fantasies.,/review/rw4744045/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2016,brooksrob1,10," Note to self; DO NOT BECOME BILLIONAIRE : )...
","There are many series and movies about being a rich billionaire, many are set in California, a few are in NYC but, often they are clichés' and stereotypical representations of the man. ",/review/rw4744045/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2019,davebbr,5," Getting hackneyed
","As usual, a great series starting to nosedive.The third series was getting weak on plot and by 2/3rds thru the fourth season, one was starting to wish Taylor and a few other characters had been killed off at birth. Shame.",/review/rw4744045/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2020,seanwilson-36931,8," A Brilliant Show That Lost Its Way
","The first two seasons of this show are some of the best TV I've watched. The battle between Axe and Chuck (two awesome lead characters) is thrilling, engaging stuff and there are some interesting sub-plots too. At one point it was one of my favourite shows of all time.",/review/rw4744045/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2021,loozzotys,2," first 3 seasons great then downhill

31 January 2022,bullseyejack-880-914376,7," Without Axe, the show has lost its edge.
","It's a different show, but not for the better. Giamatti's new persona and plans make no sense, nor do Corey Stoll's. The main characters who have left the show have diminished it. The new characters have not improved it.",/review/rw4744045/?ref_=tt_urv

19 September 2021,quocvietle,2," Stop while you're ahead
","First 2 season was so underratedly good, can probably head-to-head with some of HBO. Then season 3 was a small set back in quality, several things being dragged and stretched too much. Season 4 just plainly poor, let Bryan go whilst kept Tyler Mason was a big and questionable choice. Then season 5 ... awful, intolerable compare to the predecessor. The painter is plain and boring, new character are not interesting, a Julianna Margulies that contribute nothing and the Tyler Mason gamble is a complete lost.",/review/rw4744045/?ref_=tt_urv

25 March 2019,luigiterra,1," Significantly worse
","In season 4, everyone is an extreme caricature of themselves. The polished, unlikely, overplayed mimicry, the mechanical punchline-based conversations and the hurried manner as if the writers have to finish a given number of scenes before being allowed to go to the toilet -- it´s nowhere near the previous quality.
Dialogues, contexts, heartbeat - all gone. This is pure lazy writing and ""let´s get this over with so we can go home""-mentality and openly communicated.
You´ll only end up annoyed by this. Watch something else.",/review/rw4744045/?ref_=tt_urv
