1 February 2016,nbmartino,9," Heartwarming Superhero Tale with Excellent Writing: Renews My Faith in Animation!
","There is a lot to love about Miraculous Ladybug. As a rabid lover of animation since the 90's boom of TV animation, I can tell you right now that it is perhaps one of the most phenomenal cartoons I have seen in an extremely long time. Combing a plethora of genres, from action, to comedy, to fantasy, and romance, ""Miraculous"" is an example of a series that is not afraid to take risks and defy common conventions of the genre in order to maximize quality, something that has been absent from modern television for a decade. At first glance it may appear like a typical magical girl/lame superhero program, but do NOT let the kiddy ladybug image fool you. It has such a high enjoyment value that you will forget that you are watching someone fighting monsters every week, but rather, live through the experiences of a not-so- typical high school girl whose life has been changed forever.",/review/rw7666662/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2020,thenolanfan,6," Review - Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir
","During the first season, I was a fan of the series. I have nothing to say about the basics of the story and the romance, originally, it was what interested me on the show more than the combat. However, 5 years after the beginning of the show, nothing went beyond, the character are still pretty much the same and no important revelations were made. I'm bored of the reviewing the same formula over and over again. I want some changes, this series unlike many other takes is time too much three seasons of 10 episodes would have been enough. The producers announced that there will be 5 season and that the series would end in 2021. However, I will probably watch the final in 2022. That means that this series would have been 7 years old. I think that the viewers are growing an that it would be the time to end the series. At the beginning of the first season, I gave it a 9/10 now it is a 6/10. I don't want to go below 6/10. I hope they will review their formula.",/review/rw7666662/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2020,RachelCop,3," I used to like this show but..
","The start of Season 1, I was loving this show.. sure it took until the end of Season to actually give us more of a story but hey it was something. All the episodes repeat the same formula: someone gets sad/mad Hawkmoth sends out a butterfly to turn that person evil then Ladybug and Chat Noir save the day. That's pretty much all of it, so the plot is Marinette is obsessed with Adrien but is nervous to admit her feelings. While Adrien is in love with Ladybug (Marinette as a hero), so basically they both love each other but don't know it yet. I used to love Marinette in Season 1 but after a while.. she's a creepy stalker willing to take out any girl who even dares talk to him. She knows Adrien's entire schedule, and none of her friends even raise an eyebrow to it.. they encourage it!",/review/rw7666662/?ref_=tt_urv

9 February 2019,alv790,," Fluffy but pleasant, it's more enjoyable than I would have expected
","This is a sweet TV show about a high school girl who is secretly a superhero, and protects Paris with the help of a high school boy superhero. The fight are innocent and rely more on smarts than on violence. There's never any real harm done because all damage is magically repaired after a villain is defeated, and the villains are ""de-evilized"", so they can happily go back to their normal life.",/review/rw7666662/?ref_=tt_urv

","This just... needs to stop. It keeps going and it's almost like every character is having negative development. And goodness knows the episodes themselves are... repetitive at best. Honestly, I had high hopes when this show released... but I'm slowly losing interest.",/review/rw7666662/?ref_=tt_urv

4 June 2016,jjiawen,10," Sometimes my jaw falls open while watching. But maybe that's just me.

1 December 2021,ultimatedisneycruisefan,10," I'm an adult and I love this, but some intense scenes.
","This is the most amazing show that Zag has created, a true treasure trove of love-squares like Adrien and Marinette (I wanna see them get together sooooooooo badly!!!!!!!!!), Ladybug and Cat Noir, Alya and Nino, and much more! Although I've been noticing very dark things about this show; like Adrien being mentally abused and neglected by his father Gabriel ""McEvil"" Agreste (he is Hawkmoth), Cat Blanc, Ephemeral, theories about the Agrestes, and much more. I mean this is kid friendly, but I highly advise parental supervision on most Season 4 episodes and Season 3's episodes: Cat Blanc and LadyZilla (my nickname for the ""Ladybug"" sentimonster episode). This show is definitely the ""Splash Mountain"" of emotions, but it's worth it. Go check it out! :)",/review/rw7666662/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2016,carmenreyesdavila,10," What Animation needed!
","I absolutely love this show. Not only it does have an amazing humor, but the animation is sublime. We can quickly relate to the characters and experience some greatly written adventures! I can assure you'll quickly become addicted to this show.",/review/rw7666662/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2016,jimihandrix,8," Great french cartoon
","Okay so as you probably've guessed after reading the premise,LadyBug is a homage to the superhero and magical girl genre,and it shows in its transformation scenes,to the villain who turns innocent people into his henchmen by using his mind control powers,to the whole ""oh,I'm not interested in you,Cat Noir,I got a crush on Adrien,a guy who looks just like you but can't be you"" cliché.However even if it might use some clichés,most of the times they come off as a homage rather than a repetition of something which has been done over and over again.It really doesn't matter if something has been done before,what it really matters is what you make out of it.My only real problem with this show is that it feels a little bit too much like Sailor Moon,yes I know it's supposed to be a homage but sometimes the tune feels a bit generic especially when it comes about the villain.He's not bad but someone like him could very well belong to any magical girl anime who had a villain with mind control powers. Anyway outside of this the show doesn't have any other real problems and the CG is awesome by TV's standards.Okay,maybe some character look better than others but Marinette,who's our protagonist has the best design and the best transformation scenes.Originally the show was gonna have a 2D anime style but I think the art style changed for the best.By not making it look like a traditional anime they made it easier for the viewer to recognize its comic book superhero themes and the action also feels more intense because of the CG.Also for a french cartoon the English dub seems to be pretty good so far,yeah some characters sound better than others and it's once again Marinette who got the best voice and for an European cartoon you don't usually expect something like this from English dubbers.Still,I recommend you to first watch it in french if you ever decide to fallow this series.",/review/rw7666662/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2016,mccreadielyn,10," A Charming Series!
","This show is one of the best I've seen! I love everything about it. The characters, the CGI, the music. It's really charming. This show is full of innovation and smart ideas (such as the villains and about the miraculous) and it never fails to entertain me. The characters are mostly likable, although the characters Chloe and Lila got on my nerves a bit. The English dub is pretty good too- the voice acting and the lines.",/review/rw7666662/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2020,kermitkid,9," Claws Out
","French CGI anime-style cartoon that debuted in 2015. I had seen bits and pieces of the show here and there, and I remember someone at a church Halloween party was dressed as Marinette, but I only recently got into the show, and I was hooked from the first episode. The animation is gorgeous! The facial expressions are just so big! The animation is fluid! A lot of CGI shows these days tend to look cheaper, but this looks very movie quality, almost on level with Pixar. For me, this show really hearkens back to when I was a kid and watching shows like ""Kim Possible'' or ""Batman: The Animated Series"". A weekly superhero series with a new ""villain of the week"". So what is the plot of this show? Marinette and Adrien are two teenagers in the city of Paris who are chosen by a Chinese master to become holders of beings called kwamis, which power the source of their superpowers called Miraculous. Adrien's miraculous is his ring, and Marinette's is her earrings. The main villain is a man named Hawk Moth, who wants to obtain their Miraculous for himself, for reasons I'm not going to spoil, and I'm also not going to spoil Hawk Moth's true identity, but if you haven't figured it out by the end of season 1, you weren't paying attention. Hawk Moth uses his own miraculous for evil, and to feed off the negative emotions of Paris' citizens and gives them superpowers to get revenge on the person who wronged them, with the stipulation that after their revenge is gained, they will steal Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous and bring them back to him. This is pretty much the formula for every episode. Someone will be wronged, usually by Chloe, Hawk Moth will give them superpowers, they'll terrorize, Marinette and Adrien will transform into Ladybug and Cat Noir, they'll fight the villain, they'll win, turn them back to normal, and Hawk Moth will basically say ""I'll get you next time."" The biggest thing about the show is the dramatic irony in the writing. Marinette has a crush on Adrien, not knowing he's Cat Noir, and Adrien has a crush on Ladybug, not realizing she's Marinette. This can be delightful frustrating for the viewer, as several times the ship comes close to sailing, but something ends up screwing it up. Another great thing about the show, is that, while it is primarily focused on Marinette, and the fact that is technically a female-led superhero show, it never makes a big deal out of it. It's like how Kim Possible and Ron Stoppable were equal partners in the team, even though Kim was technically the leader. It never flaunts or shoves down your throat that it's a female led show....unlike a lot of other things that have been doing that lately. (Supergirl, Captain Marvel, Dark Phoenix, etc.). This makes it a show that boys can enjoy as well. While the season 1 and 2 episodes are essentially the same thing over and over, but with a new villain, the episodes after that start to give more insight and backstory into the lore of the world and expand upon the abilities of the kwamis. I really like this show, and hope that Disney, who now owns the show, sees the potential in it as well, and gives it more seasons.",/review/rw7666662/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2019,9thgraders,10," A very good cartoon
","This is a comedy and fantasy. The director of the film is Jeremy Zag. There are two characters. Adrien and Marinette and the characters are superheroes (Lady bug and Chat Noir). The scenes are in the street and in the school. In the morning Marinette and Adrien go to school. At ten oclock, a horrible man opens the door, and he has a pencil ball, Adrien and Marinette run for a toilette and they transform. They go to the class and they get a power. I like this cartoon because there is suspense and action. This is a very good cartoon.
The heroes follow the horrible man and they take the powers from the man.
And I like this because he is in a street for a day, but they don't kill the characters.",/review/rw7666662/?ref_=tt_urv

","OK so.... I hate seeing hate for this show. I can understand hating certain characters but... This show is amazing. It's full of comedy and it can contain mystery like ""who's next?"" and ""will they ever find out?"" I really wish people would give this a chance instead of reading one bad review about it. Seriously just give it a chance! If you like it, you like it. If you don't you don't. No need to make a big deal about it.",/review/rw7666662/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2016,dothetorpedo,7," great series
","The episodes are a bit repetitive, but still very creative and unpredictable. We know the Lady will win in the end, but it's always a surprise how. The two leads are very well balanced and likable, and the series manages to create enough interest. Marinette herself is a very great role model, but still feels well rounded enough to be sincere, and the audience finds it easy to root for her and Adrien, the secondary lead; and there is enough tension between the two to keep it compelling.",/review/rw7666662/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2018,rainadaunen,10," Amazing!
","This show is so amazing! The animation is gorgeous, the characters are funny and likeable, the fight scenes are look awesome, my only complaint is the story.
it's kinda bland and has already been used a thousand times 
but other than that,
If your looking for something to watch that's funny, romantic, and filled with Acton, or just wanna watch something with your kids, siblings, cousins,or ect this is a must watch
I definitely definitely recommend it",/review/rw7666662/?ref_=tt_urv

22 June 2021,EarthToLil,1," This show feels like it's made for 3 year olds
","This show makes me want to hit my head against a wall because it's so stupid and way too cheesy. My friends all like this show and they don't respect the fact that I don't like this cartoon. The whole fan base in general is just toxic with all the shipping and inappropriate drawings online. It's not funny, the animation looks like clay and the episodes are predictable because basically the same thing happens in every episode. I don't really have much to say, I just hate this show.",/review/rw7666662/?ref_=tt_urv
