20 December 2015,claudio_carvalho,8," Tense Thriller
","The American engineer Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson) is expatriated to Southeast Asia to work in the water plant of his company. He travels with his wife Annie (Lake Bell) and their daughters Lucy and Beeze and befriends the English Hammond (Pierce Brosnan) at the airport. Nobody from his company comes to take Jack and his family to the hotel and he accepts the ride offered by Hammond with his local friend Kenny Rogers (Sahajak Boonthanakit). Soon Jack notes that the television, telephone, Internet and cellular do not work and the front desk explains that they are facing problems. On the next morning, Jack walks to the market to buy a newspaper, he discovers that there is a revolution in the country and the rebels are executing foreigners. Now his only hope is to reach the American Embassy with his family. But the rebels are everywhere and Jack does not speak or read the language of the country.",/review/rw3403419/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2015,palavitsinis,7," Unexpected... Bravo!
","Going to watch a movie with Owen Wilson starring, you usually expect some kind of comedy or romance. Not this time. I was really worried that he would not be up to the task with this one, but this was not true, not true at all!",/review/rw3403419/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2015,bob-the-movie-man,8," Tenser than a tuk-tuk ride at rush hour
","""No Escape"" is set in an anonymous South East Asia country bordering Vietnam facing a violent civil war, with the uprising triggered by perceived foreign imperialist intervention. The film was shot in Thailand but looks and feels like Cambodia. Having had the fortune to spend time in Cambodia and be immersed in its troubling history, this feels well positioned: the economic premise at the heart of the film - that governments invest in loss-leading foreign-aid, in this case water treatment, to 'buy' future strings of the leadership - is controversial but has the ring of truth about it. Countries like Cambodia have been used as political footballs by the Super Powers for many years, and are pressure-cookers of injustice and discontent.",/review/rw3403419/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2015,paul-allaer,8," Much better than the movie critics would have you believe
","As ""No Escape"" (2015 release; 103 min.) open, we see a high level meeting taking place (drinks are tested for poison before consumption). It's the Prime Minister (of an unnamed country), and before we know it, the Prime Minister is murdered. The movie then switches to ""17 Hours Earlier"", as we get to know the Dwyer family as they are en route to Southeast Asia: Jack (played by Owen Wilson), Annie (played by Lake Bell), and their two young daughters Lucy and Beeze. During the flight they also meet Hammond (played by Pierce Brosnan), who has visited the country 15 times and knows the place inside out. Upon arrival at their hotel, Annie comments ""Welcome to the fourth world!"", as there is no functioning TV, phone or internet. The next morning Jack goes for a walk to by a US newspaper, and inadvertently gets mixed up in a stand-off between demonstrators and police in riot gear. At this point, we are not yet 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw3403419/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2015,sddavis63,9," A Non-Stop Heart Pounder!
",There were scenes in this movie when I literally felt as if my heart was going to pound its way out of my chest. Among other scenes I'm thinking of the extremely quease-inducing one where the Dwyers have to leap from one building roof to another to escape those trying to kill them - and as part of it they actually have to throw their young children across the open space from one roof to another. I could barely watch that scene. And has there been a more horrific scene filmed than the one in which young Lucy Dwyer (who can't be more than 10) has a gun put to her head and another in her hands and is told she'll be killed unless she kills her father. There are several times in this movie where the title seems to be the only possible conclusion. Surely there's no escape for this family.,/review/rw3403419/?ref_=tt_urv

26 August 2015,StevePulaski,7," Fulfilling entertainment with slickly (and clearly) edited action
","John Erick Dowdle's ""No Escape"" is a taut thriller, nicely edited and strongly paced, resulting in a film that knows exactly how to get your adrenaline up and your movie-going senses tingled. Dowdle has been a strong force in the horror genre ever since his seldom-seen, largely unreleased debut ""The Poughkeepsie Tapes"" came onto the scene in 2007. Since then, Dowdle has proved his ability to direct claustrophobic thrillers such as ""As Above, So Below"" and ""Devil,"" solidifying his filmography as dynamic and rounded, especially for a horror/thriller director.",/review/rw3403419/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2016,Leofwine_draca,6," A good story, well told
","A good story, well told is how I would describe this above-average American thriller that actually manages a certain level of intensity and momentum, two qualities I always look out for in my movies. It's a simple action thriller with a focus on movement and escape, as an American family visiting an unnamed south-east Asian country find themselves caught up in a coup and must literally flee for their lives.",/review/rw3403419/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," No Escape
",One of my favorite movies of 2015... A fantastic movie about an American expat family trapped in an unnamed South East Asian country after a civil war had broke out; fighting for survival and a way out of the war torn country. Owen Wilson's should be given credit for acting in roles that are out of his typecast. Wilson's acting really shines in this movie. While Brosnan played a convincing Blackops operative that indirectly fueled the fire to a revolution/coup. I would recommend anyone to watch it at least once... I would greenlight a prequel to the backstory of Hammond (Brosnan's character) if given the opportunity because it would be an amazing movie. Even a spinoff sequel focusing on the other expats trapped in that same country would be watch worthy.,/review/rw3403419/?ref_=tt_urv

2 September 2015,suzgotmail,9," Finally -- an action movie without a zillion pointless explosions
","I went to this movie because I was curious -- Owen Wilson NOT in a comedy?? I was pleasantly surprised. Owen Wilson nailed it -- a loving father trying *desperately* to save his family. Yes, this situation has been done a zillion times before (for example, THREE ""Taken"" movies) -- but I've never seen it done with this much intensity. The movie's focus was not on the ""action."" Rather, the focus was on the interplay between the parents/kids, how they dealt with each other and the various situations, providing a deeply human touch against a horrifically inhuman background (a massacre). And it was this extreme contrast, of the human vs the inhuman, that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the movie.",/review/rw3403419/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2020,rachelvick-55947,9," This movie is way underrated!
","My husband and I are big into movies of all genres and appreciate quality. We loved this movie. It was very intense/stressful with suspense from beginning to end. It speaks to what parents/family would do for each other. We had never seen Owen Wilson in a role like this, but thought he and Lake Bell did a phenomenal job! Believable performances by all. Even the kids did great. This movie is very underrated!",/review/rw3403419/?ref_=tt_urv

25 August 2015,ferguson-6,5," Kenny Rogers Taxi Company
",Greetings again from the darkness. An effective thriller must either put real people smack dab in the middle of believable peril or facilitate the suspension of disbelief. This latest from writer/director John Erick Dowdle (co-written with his brother Drew Dowdle) takes bits of each of those approaches and provides a pretty intense ride despite the mostly nonsensical happenings.,/review/rw3403419/?ref_=tt_urv

","I went in to this movie not expecting much. having read some reviews online prior i had my hopes set a little higher as many people said the intensity of the movie was high. the reviews did not do that justice. this might be one of the most relentless in your face movies i have ever seen. once things start to go wrong and believe me it does not take long at all, it rarely ever gives you a chance to breathe.",/review/rw3403419/?ref_=tt_urv

",I really enjoyed this movie from the plot to the acting and the ending. It was purely intense and will definitely have you on the edge of your seat.

6 September 2015,wrhalljr1,8," Good Movie
","I thought Owen Wilson was excellent in this movie. It was very suspenseful and really did keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Pretty graphic I must say, which is the only reason I did not give it a 9 or 10, but well written with an excellent plot. Going in I was a little apprehensive as to how good Owen Wilson was going to be in an ""action"" movie but he did not disappoint. A tad unbelievable given his build and stature as to what he was able to do from a physical standpoint in the movie but still kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. All in all I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes action and suspense.",/review/rw3403419/?ref_=tt_urv

",This thriller about an American family caught up in a bloody coup in an unnamed South East Asian country is exciting from start to finish. It's a fictional thriller with elements of some real terror we have seen in true stories like 'Hotel Rwanda' and 'The Killing Fields'. The on location (Thailand) filming is atmospheric.,/review/rw3403419/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2015,Aylmer,5," Shark-jumping opportunity misser nonetheless offers many solid thrilling moments
","There are certainly many things this film has in common with Owen Wilson's other ""serious"" action movie BEHIND ENEMY LINES, with him as a fish out of water in a hostile foreign country just trying to get to safety and gradually being pushed more and more into action hero territory as the film goes on. This film is a little different in that Wilson is just a totally average employee and having to protect his wife and two young daughters. The selling point for a suspense-based film like this is realism, which the makers excellently set up in the first half but completely lose gradually as the film goes on due to some utterly head-scratching decisions...",/review/rw3403419/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2015,tanpurepiyush,8," Owen Wilson is so good in serious roles !!
","I always enjoyed Owen Wilson's comedies but I still recall his Behind Enemy lines role and he did it so perfect! In this movie too, I did expect him to do a fantastic job in a serious role and he just crosses all your expectations! Pierce Brosnon was was amazing in this movie, though not that much of a screen time he shares, but shines in whatever time he gets on screen. The child actors and the female lead did their job fair n square. The slow motions used are so perfectly timed in this movie and go so well with the background scores.",/review/rw3403419/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2015,pc95,3," Far-Fetched Garbage
","(spoilers) Director John Erik Dowdle has failed with ""No Escape"", a ridiculous ""thriller"" that features a brain-dead script. This is fair warning to ""escape"" watching this mess while you can. Not worth your time...I used fast-forward greatly. Anyone whose traveled internationally knows that unless you're a complete imbecile, you research where you're going as well as the people and customs of the land. Here we're supposed to believe that an engineer/businessman would haul his whole family over to Thailand unwittingly during a government coup. About 25 min of runtime in subsequent to introductions, the movie spirals out of logic. At least a dozen scenes are completely ridiculous. There's the helicopter crashing right ontop of them, bullets flying everywhere but hitting them, and my personal favorite Wilson character actually throwing his daughters across 10 story rooftops. And of course even a tank brought in for the wow factor. This is tasteless, vapid junk. Wilson, Bell, and especially Bronson are collecting paychecks. Awful 3/10 STAY AWAY Check out ""The Year of Living Dangerously for real cinema.",/review/rw3403419/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2016,disinterested_spectator,6," A Revolution Saves a Family
","""No Escape"" is principally a fantasy film for husbands who are failures. A lot of men feel they have let their wives down, and in this movie, Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson) has done so in a big way. From the dialogue we learn that he used to be in business for himself, but he eventually had to give that up. So, he takes a job with Cardiff, a water company, requiring that he relocate his family to some unnamed country, which would have to be either Laos or Cambodia, which means he and his family are strangers in a strange land, where they don't speak the language and where the food being sold in the marketplace would cause you to lose your appetite. They check into a hotel where the phone doesn't work, some of the lights don't come on, and there is nothing but snow on television. And this looks like the best hotel in the whole city. It all proves to be too much for Jack's wife Annie (Lake Bell), and in the middle of the night he finds her sitting on the floor of the bathroom crying. In other words, if things had proceeded normally from this point, this would have been a movie of misery, probably resulting in Annie's taking their two children back to the United States before long and filing for divorce.",/review/rw3403419/?ref_=tt_urv
