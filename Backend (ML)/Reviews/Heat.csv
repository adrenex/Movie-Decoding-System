28 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Great Show!
","Barry is absolutely deserving of all the praise it gets and Bill Hader is excellent in this! In fact, the entire cast is amazing. It has been nominated and won so many awards it's hard to keep track of and every one of them has been deserving. This show has everything in it...comedy, drama, action, suspense, etc, etc. It follows a depressed hitman named Barry (Bill Hader) who's looking for a way out of the business. He travels to LA to exeoan actor but falls in love with the city. He gets involved with an acting class and instantly loves it and wants to become an actor. He meets and falls for his girlfriend, Sally (Sarah Goldberg), there. He wants to become an actor but his old handler, Fuchs, won't let him walk away. Besides Hader and Goldberg, it stars Henry Winkler, Anthony Carrigan, Stephen Root and more. I can't say enough about this incredible show that hasn't already been said, I promise you will not be disappointed once you start watching it!",/review/rw4773250/?ref_=tt_urv

3 December 2022,ahmxii,9," Unique in its nature.
","Everything about the show is perfect. In its every episode ending it lets viewers with no words, thats what happened when I finished season 3, still I havent got words to say. Just wanna say this is the most greatest shid I ever seen. It was dark, funny, & brilliant! Hader is a standout as Barry. The range he shows is phenomenal.",/review/rw4773250/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2018,pwtatl,10," Those Chechens!
","I agree with everything good said about this black comedy and can only emphatically add that the Chechen gang is exquisitely crafted and hilarious. Perhaps the most extraordinary character, the bald Noho (""Can I get you a submarine sandwich?""), is unforgettable. Just a brilliant performance. The ridiculous twins, one who is obsessed with killing Barry and then his tortuous brother who insists on building a set of stocks, are wonderfully absurd.",/review/rw4773250/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,lakings97,8," Darker and edger
","Barry: Season 3 on HBOMax finds Barry who is played by Bill Hader who can't forgive himself for killing Henry Winkler's girlfriend. His grief and anger issues put him in a dark place to try to help Henry because of his guilt. In the meantime the Bolivians and Checknyans continue their war against each other to the point that the father in law played by Miguel Sandoval travels from Bolivia to bring order to his gay son Michael Irby's group. Anthony Carrigan and Irby fall in love end up prisoners in Bolivia. Stephen Root does not appreciate what's in front of him but ends up seeking vengeance towards Barry. Overall this is a dark comedy series that is funny, well written and captivates the audience. Alec Berg and Hader bring together a great cast but each episode is it just was not long enough. The stories could be lengthened but I am sure it is very expensive to make. Looking forward to the fourth season.",/review/rw4773250/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2020,tb-07119,10," This show has everything
","HBO's hottest show is ""BARRY"".
Former SNL member and current boyfriend of the internet, Bill Hader, has gone ALL OUT.
This show has everything! Depression, ptsd, a morally conflicted hit-man, and if that's not funny enough, just wait till episode 7!",/review/rw4773250/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2022,kenc-05236,9," like 50% dark 40% humor 10% everything else for a amazing show
","This show reminds me a little of how Bojack Horseman is structured in a good way. With being all happy and go lucky until it stops on a dime and becomes an insane tense filled show all because the main character is a ""good guy"" that's really an jerk. Now that since Bojack is one my favorite show that's a great compliment from me but Barry also does its own thing.",/review/rw4773250/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2022,d_carlotaj,8," LA: Mecca for Lost Souls
","""Barry. (2018), a tv series. Directed by Bill Hader and Alec Berg, who created it. Stars Stephen Root and Sarah Goldberg and Henry Winkler. This movie is either a horror film or a theater of the absurd film. But if it's both, the film manages to skillfully weave these two genres together to make a statement about the film industry, its purpose and patterns of psychological states of minds of the ""hopefuls"" who desperately pursue success in acting. At times it is almost painful to watch as the actors' dreams descend into bathos. Years of trauma, neglect, and rejection literally warp their perceptions to the point to where they cannot distinguish between reality and fantasy. They are seeking truth in acting. Which is actually an oxymoron. They end up believing that if they ""hit all the marks,"" they will maneuver themselves into position to attain validation, fame, money, career, acceptance, love. All that glitters that is supposed to be fulfilling. This film shows just how myth can destroy lives. Like the hopefuls flocking to LA, and even the migrants who believe that America is an endless utopia ripe for the picking, dreams will be dashed when reality sets in.",/review/rw4773250/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2020,LongLiveTheNewFlesh27,9," A brilliant comedy that you cannot miss
","When I first read the description of Barry, I immediately dismissed the show as being either too high concept or too gimmicky to be fun. I was wrong. Not only is this show a total hidden gem, but it contains some of the funniest and most morally complex characters on TV.",/review/rw4773250/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2018,deloudelouvain,8," We want more seasons!
","I just finished binge watching season one of Barry. Short episodes you can't get enough of. It would be a total disappointment if there would be not more seasons of this show. It's the perfect mix between crime and comedy. The humor is very subtle, almost like they don't do it on purpose to be funny, but they certainly are. Bill Hader as Barry has one of those faces and expressions that makes him naturally funny. But not only him, but the whole cast was funny. Stephen Root, Glenn Fleshler, Anthony Carrigan, Paula Newsome, Henry Winkler and Sarah Goldberg all add something funny and special to this show. The story is well brought and entertaining. I really can't wait for more seasons of Barry.",/review/rw4773250/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,NormalGuyReviews,9," What Perfectly Timed Comic Relief Looks Like
","This is a great show I highly recommend it. Barry has drama, action, thrill, and lots of laughs. Like I said, if you enjoy well timed comic relief this is the show for you. Also, Bill Haders performance is perfect and I can't imagine anyone else in this role.",/review/rw4773250/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,hector-61488,8," Thoroughly entertaining.
","With Bill Hader going all out in this series, one does not need to think twice if its worth a watch.",/review/rw4773250/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2019,cherold,8," Fascinating, often hilarious comedy that gets better, then gets darker.
","I was on the fence after the first episode of Barry, which was quirky and amusing but didn't quite grab me. But my girlfriend insisted we watch a second episode, and then I got hooked.",/review/rw4773250/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,loganschainker,10," Bill Hader's Masterpiece
","I find it interesting that though this series is critically acclaimed, it has less than a 100,000 ratings on IMDB. Similar to Better Call Saul, Barry does a fantastic job at balancing darkness with humor. It's a very easy series to binge. The episodes manage to pack a lot without feeling rushed in a short runtime of only 30 minutes. The best part of this series is Bill Hader. He perfected the character of Barry Berkman. Season 3 was excellent and is by far the darkest yet. Overall, Barry is one of the best series' on television right now. If your still not sold, I recommend you watch the ""ronny/lily"" episode. Not only is it the best of the series, it stands pretty well on it's own.",/review/rw4773250/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2018,neener3707,8," As Charming And Fun As I Imagined
","Right from the get go I knew this would be a gem, from the trailers to the clips, there was something unique and charming about it. Happily I was not disappointing as the show now has my full attention and I really liked it, looks like another HBO. So you know the premise, killer gets dragged into an acting class, finds out he loves it even though he sucks, now he wants to balance killing with his new found passion. But without giving anything away, there is more to the story than just that. The writing was as witty and charismatic as I expected, kind of reminded me of Dexter. The producers are known for some pretty big shows like Seinfeld, Silicon Valley, and of course Bill Hader himself. So its no surprise we have another fun little show on our hands.",/review/rw4773250/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,RT Firefly,," Season 3... why?
","The first two seasons of this show were extraordinary. Hader and Berg told a story of how complicated life can become and walked the thin line of how we as humans do bad things, yet justify them in our own heads, no matter how terrible they might be. It was a superb psychological study, and they did it all with comedy, which is an amazing achievement. Then came season 3.",/review/rw4773250/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2022,NixSar,7," A dark comedy with plenty of spirit marred by uneven third season
","Barry's excellent first season deftly blends comedy with very dark material, avoiding the usual clichés or owning up to them in creative and fresh ways. The acting is excellent all-round with no one to single out as being too good or bad. The second season continues much in the same vein, but the material is already suffering. The original premise is being milked too hard and loses some luster and charm, but it is still quite fun and better than many of the shows out there. Then comes the third season, and I think the whole creative team completely messes up. They knew they cannot keep doing the same thing three seasons in a row, but they couldn't quite decide what it is they are doing.",/review/rw4773250/?ref_=tt_urv

7 July 2020,ebeckstr-1,10," Two words...
","Per. Fect. Through two seasons thus far this show is perfectly written, perfectly cast, perfectly acted, perfectly directed. It is simultaneously bust-a-gut hilarious and gut-wrenchingly dark, disturbing, complex, and moving. Bill Hader and company have created something genuinely unique, and what might go down as one of the best American television series ever.",/review/rw4773250/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2020,iamkeysersoze-13228,10," Bill Hader is incredible
","I don't know why I put off watching Barry so long cause it's absolutely perfect. Barry is simply one of the best tv shows of all time.
Barry is highly addictive and consistently engaging in ways I never imagined. All 8 hours fly by incredibly quick. Barry is funny, shocking, thrilling and you every character is insanely well written.
Whilst season 1 is terrific, season 2 takes things to a whole new level in everyway. It's fresh and original. I don't really have any massive flaws with the show. There's a few insignificant flaws but few and far between.
Bill Hader is absolutely incredible. Delivering not only the finest performances in his career but one of the finest tv performances ever. I would love to see him in more serious stuff like this.",/review/rw4773250/?ref_=tt_urv
