12 September 2020,mcouillard-61316,10," Caught this one by accident...and WOW! It's amazing!
","So, I just happened to see this up on Netflix this morning, and I was bored and really had nothing else to watch, so I said ""I'll give this one episode, it's rated G and is a musical, so I'm not expecting much"".
.......
And, i just finished binging the whole damn thing! Let me just say that forget the fact that it's a 'kids' show for a minute, it doesn't really feel like it when you're watching it. The original music, dancing and acting were some of the best I've seen from Netflix (or anywhere else in recent memory if I'm being completely honest).
I'm 44 years old. And I LOVED this show. I've actually downloaded the soundtrack as well, and it's pretty freaking awesome!",/review/rw7669896/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2020,leahwhittingham,10," Amazing!
",I watched it all in one day. I wasn't going into this thinking it would be this good but it was really good. It was heartwarming at times and although could be cheesy it was still really good! The music is amazing and really catching I downloaded the album as soon as I finished the show. Really good to watch and might even make you cry.,/review/rw7669896/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2020,bcirilli,9," Binged it all & might need to rewatch it
","This can be a bit cheesy at times but this is one of those shows that makes you feel good inside and makes you smile and cry. The acting & writing were spot on and you honestly care about these characters and want to see them happy. The music is so much fun and every single song makes you feel something....happy, sad, inspired... This ensemble are so talented and the premise is really cute. I really hope there is another season. I just finished watching the entire season and I honestly can say that I'm fighting putting it on again. Bravo to all involved. Wardrobe, lighting, writing, audio, acting, set design (and others), you all did a fantastic job.",/review/rw7669896/?ref_=tt_urv

",The 7+ rating on this show shouldn't turn anyone older than that age away. This show is amazing!,/review/rw7669896/?ref_=tt_urv

13 September 2020,rocknredfox,10," BEST SHOW
","I loved this show much I watched the whole season in a day!! That's saying something. It's a feel good, funny, emotional, and romantic show that just makes you feel good. Truly a very ""high school musical"" like show. The music is great let me add. Great for teens or preteens and family friendly. LOVE!",/review/rw7669896/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2021,TheDyingGirl,10," Everything that HSM and Glee wished it could be!!
",Honestly it was so good and I am way too old for the tv show. Normally I wouldn't watch it but the premise intrigued me. The good news is that the show did not dissapoint. Great music as well. I am also glad they found an actress who could actually sing not that nasally annoying voice that most Disney stars have.,/review/rw7669896/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2020,ladybugz613-230-471608,10," Unexpected entertainment
","I'll start with the fact that I'm 64. I stumbled across this yesterday while getting ready to watch something else and was, slightly, intrigued. When my teen daughter came out to see what I was watching I described it as a kind of High School Musical kind of show, by the very talented Kenny Ortega. I was already 3 episodes in. I just finished the last episode. And I gotta tell ya, it just kept getting better with each one. Yeah, it's a little cheesy, but some cheese is good. The music was pretty great! The last episode ended with a cliffhanger and I just said ""what?? That can't be it!"" And looked to see if a 2nd season has been ordered. It hasn't, but im gonna keep hoping for it, because I can't wait to see how this plays out!!",/review/rw7669896/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2020,cddrra-82766,10," This will lift your spirits! Amazing! 3rd time watching it!
","I loved every minute of it! So emotional and yet so uplifting! I cried, laughed and loved the songs! Its so good Ive watched it 3 times and downloaded the album. Loved it! Waiting for season 2",/review/rw7669896/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2020,Zaid_Khoury,9," Old disney vibes
","This show brings joy and excitement, it focuses on friendship and innocent crushes yet the music was outstanding. Director Kenny Ortega is amazing, picked a good cast to represent JATP, the song choices were very nice and not too hard on the ear, excited to see what else Season 2 brings us.",/review/rw7669896/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2020,Geniface,10," A Great Watch
","I stumbled across this show completely by accident, and was only intrigued because of the title(I like ghost shows), and I found myself binge watching the whole series. The writers of this show really know how to make you fall in love with the characters and make you want more. I cannot wait for season 2.",/review/rw7669896/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2021,adaptor,7," Fun for the whole family
","I watched this with my kids because I knew some people that show up as extras in the band scenes. However, I was pleasantly surprised by it. I am not its target audience but I could still enjoy it and I think it is a good story with some great messages for kids.",/review/rw7669896/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2020,rutbachoudhury,8," julie and the phantoms
","Season 1:
ok so i mean kinda cringy but like bro lowkey love it. i didn't even know there was gonna be singing even tho i watched the trailer but omg the songs r such a bop. like the first ep it started off with the sunset curve singing and i was like ok that's pretty good and then at the end of the ep when she sang wake up aka one of my fav songs on this track i was like wait this is too good and then the 2nd ep when they sang bright forever and my guy luke started to sing, literally my mouth opened he was so good and the song was so good it was just too good. i love how netflix actually chose people who played an instrument and they were all able to sing which i absolutely loved and this show was too short. i need season 2 but with like 20 episodes plz. also i wish it was a little more for an older audience but can't do anything about it that. love and ship luke and julie so hard.",/review/rw7669896/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2020,maanikroda,7," I love the Julie and Luke chemistry going on. I'm dying to see where they take that relationship next season
","I just started watching today and I'm in love. These characters are so relatable and yet so unique at the same time. Like, I said, I started watching it today and in between my crazy amount of work, I managed to already watch 6 episodes back to back. I think its fantastic and am on the edge of my seat. I think it is also cool that I noticed Cheyenne Jackson, Jadah Marie, and Booboo Stuart and all from the descendants franchise along with the director/producer Kenny Ortega. Also that Owen Joyner and Savannah Lee May worked together in Knight Squad. It's amazing to see different cast mates working together again.",/review/rw7669896/?ref_=tt_urv

",I really wish there had been more episodes. I just keep watching the one season over when I need uplifting. Great music and great energy!!!,/review/rw7669896/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2020,dreamingstar-68136,10," Love, love, love!!! THANK YOU KENNY ORTEGA!!!
","This show was something I went into being interested but not expecting too much and I've never been more glad to be wrong!!! It was charming, funny, heartfelt and had INCREDIBLE music!!! I cried both happy and sad tears but every minute was worth it!! I never thought I'd feel so much emotion over a ghost boy band and the chemistry they had with not only each other but also Julie!!! Also I could listen to Cheyenne Jackson sing for hours and Boo Boo Stewart showed really good and emotional acting chops in this too! Kenny Ortega THANK YOU for bringing us this incredible experience!!!!",/review/rw7669896/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2020,jgardiner-871-726729,8," Back from the dead
","This a great family show. It's for all ages.
This show is about losing loved ones, and trying to cope with grief, growing up, making and honouring friendships, respecting others and their emotions and of course some awesome music!
The main actress is so talented.
Some of the sweetest love songs and dances. Terrific musical but I don't know if I like all those friendship bands on her hands. Lots of love and sentimentality about lost relationships.",/review/rw7669896/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2020,johannes2000-1,8," Entertaining, with some great music!
","This is a very sympathetic show, with an original premise, a good pace and some surprisingly fine music. It's clearly aimed at (female) teens, so story and dialogues are accordingly very respectable and decent. There's a gay character in it, that's at least something, but regrettably he get's no further with his male love-interest than a big hug, evidently even a kiss was too daring.",/review/rw7669896/?ref_=tt_urv

",I watched all 9 episodes the day it came out on Netflix. I love this show! I am constantly rewatching the performances. The singers have amazing voices and the story line is pretty great. I'm really hoping for a second season with a lot more episodes.,/review/rw7669896/?ref_=tt_urv

12 September 2020,dukcinea,10," Loved Every Minute.
","I've been pretty frustrated and down lately and have been. Reading a pick me up. I saw this and at first was like, this looks lame.
I was wrong. I didn't even know it was a Kenny Ortega project until I looked it up after watching the first ep.
This was exactly what I needed. 😃
I really hope there's a second season.",/review/rw7669896/?ref_=tt_urv
