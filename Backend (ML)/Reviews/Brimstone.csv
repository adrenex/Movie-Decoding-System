19 September 2021,Darwinskid,," Good thing it's on Netflix...
",...Because if it was anywhere else it would've been cancelled after its first episode.,/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2021,tonymars-63087,1," Trash
","A jumbled mess of clich√©s masquerading as a comedy show, pure garbage.",/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2021,TikkiMia,," Unfortunate, not funny
",What year was this written? It feels quite dated and like the writers just recycled old jokes from the 90's. Such a shame Netflix gave this show a season and got rid of so many other good shows.,/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2021,gregkut-245-771714,6," Very specific jokes for Chicago audience
","The CPA Twitter fees has been really funny for years. The show is decent and has a few good laughs, but is very specific for a Chicago audience and for people who grew up in pre2000's Chicago, when Chicago was full of blue collar SNL Super Fan types. A few nitpick details - Diane should be from the Southside or south suburbs.",/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2021,dvsusmc,1," Trash
","I'm a native Chicagoan. This is hot fawkn garbage. I tried, I really did. Made it to the 3rd episode and couldn't go any further. Stale inside jokes that only Chicagoans would get. It's a really bad ripoff of Peter Griffin. The Chicago centric comedy gets old really fast.",/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2021,JuYoAvGi,1," Embarrassing Portrayal Of Chicago
","I was born and raised in Chicago, and I don't know anyone who talks or acts like these people. The Chicago accent being used is ridiculous and over the top. Some of the way their words are pronounced sounds similar, but no one in Chicago has an accent that thick. I gave up after 3 episodes. Give this show a miss.",/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2021,draftdubya,1," 25 years ago maybe in a Italian neighborhood
",Whoever wrote never lived in Chicago in the last 30 years. Everything someone from outside of Chicago would say is in this show. They should've made the aunt older. 40 something year Olds are perfectly fine with technology.,/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2021,lawrencelawrence86,1," Meh
","Adult animation has become a 50/50 affair. I love some of the efforts over the last 15 years but recent attempts have left me flat due to lack of ideas and weak content. The hunger to get new programs out by different providers has definitely diluted the shows, I'm sure this will get an audience but enough to get more seasons seems doubtful.",/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2022,Sandra-durand80,1," I don't like it
","As a Chicago native, this is embarrassing. On top of that, this animated series is not funny. I found it to be boring. I wished they could tone down the profanity just a tad, too.",/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2021,springeraldmeza,1," So who is the target audience for this show?
","Not all things on Netflix are bad, but when it's bad it's bad. To get something labeled ""Adult Animation"" we need to check of an overuse of the F-bomb, brief nudity and controversial topics. It's all good if it's in good taste, for example ""Hoops"" was in bad taste, so we have a male in his mid 40s who is a basketball coach/ gym teacher who life is falling apart around him, try to find meaning in his pathetic life through teaching kids the art of basketball by using the F-bomb over and over.",/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2021,Narce,2," So if I'm NOT from Chicago, I don't matter?
",Several reviewers have mentioned that this show is somehow very true to Chicago - and I'm not just thinking of the sports teams mentioned in the show.,/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2021,tommypezmaster,9," The Mighty B Done Right
","Diana showed us that she does have a heart and will do anything in her power to set things right for them. I'm also dead serious that this should replace The Mighty B on Nick rewind. Cause this show is an underrated classic. The Mighty B (pleas do not get offended by what I'm going to call it, it's true anyways) is a short-lived critical and commercial failure. Diana is everything Bessie should've been.",/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2021,dropkickc,2," Pretty average.
","Honestly, I'm not sure what I expected from this show. I loved the Twitter account so I thought this might be great. Unfortunately, the same humor that I enjoyed from that doesn't seem to translate into this pretty mediocre show. It's a love letter to chicago, that bit definitely comes across. I'm 4 episodes in and may not finish as each episode feels so different as opposed to one cohesive piece of humor. It's a gonna be a pass from me dog. There's much better animated shows out there these days.",/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2022,Dodge-Zombie,1," Terrible.
",This isn't funny. It's frankly just terrible in every way. The main character is so annoying that I'd like to see her killed off after 5 minutes.,/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2021,sdpfnqwe,1," Hot garbage
",These comments praising the show have to be bots or the weirdos from her Twitter account. The show is just a female Bojack with a Chicago accent without any of the depth. I don't know what even possesses someone to get a team together and create something this awful.,/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2021,sbwotoronto,3," It's been done
","There are your shows where a character is either incompetent, lazy, clueless or just likes to party. Diana is all rolled into one and in the end she learns something or someone learns something from her at the end of the episode.",/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2022,nemo-90991,1," Ugh
","I really wanted to like this show. I'm in my late twenties and at this point all I watch is adult cartoons. I love bobs burgers, family guy, American dad, Simpson's, etc. The standard set is so high and this show just failed to stand up against literally any other adult cartoon out there. I really need more adult cartoons but this show was so hard to watch. I couldn't make it past episode 3. Also why are the graphics so bad. I was shocked when I found out this show was from 2021!?!?",/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2021,purgatorysun,1," What is this
",Wow Netflix just keeps bringing on the crap. Whoever looks after programing should be fired. This is just garbage. I gave it a one because I watched 10 minutes and hurt my eyes. This is just Yuck.,/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2021,michaelgentile-47492,1," Mission Hill rip of
",This is just Mission Hill with bad writing. I highly recommend checking mission hill out instead. Chicago Party Aunt is an unfunny and poorly written mess I would not recommend it to anyone its as bad as family guy and paradise pd 1/10 do not recommend.,/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2021,pfne,8," Without Lauren Ash, it wouldn't work.
","The main character in this show could be grating, annoying and a total put off... BUT.. the depth of the voice work of Lauren Ash is so good, it changes the main character into a much softer and a much more sympathetic character. She manages to temper the annoying elements of her character with a softer, more emotional element.",/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2022,cvfdchief,2," Hot mess
","Hott mess, over done, worn and tired feeling and this is coming from someone that loves South Park, Rick and Morty, Family Guy and Big Mouth.. If you want to watch something similar but well done from north of the boarder may I suggest ""Fugget About It"" !.. way better and not like this where every joke has to be spelled out and shoved in your face.",/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2021,dlbblades,8," Binge watched in one night
","UK reviewer and some jokes I didn't understand. Definitely an alternative to family guy etc. If you like rude, crude and stupid jokes, then definitely you'll find this funny. Hoping for a 2nd season thanks netflix.",/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2021,highandmightyme,2," Hot garbage
",Over and over again the magic of Rick and Morty is tried to be attempted. This is another weak attempt. It sucks. It's not funny. Don't waste your time.,/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2021,ukgreek,8," Helps to be from Chi-Town
","If you're not familiar with the cultural references (and stereotypes), it may not be very funny. But if you get them, it's pretty damn funny and there are a LOT of them. Quite creative, really.",/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2021,connorkn-87221,2," Brutal. Just brutal.
","I am the target audience for this. I live in and love Chicago, and adult animation is my favorite genre. And yet.",/review/rw7421194/?ref_=tt_urv
