29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Awesome!
","Jeremy Renner absolutely kills it in this new series from Taylor Sheridan. I watched the entire season of Mayor of Kingstown from start to finish in one weekend and I'll probably watch it again sometime in the near future. It's every bit as good as I had for. Besides Renner it also stars Kyle Chandler, Aiden Gillen and Dianne Wiest. It's created by Taylor Sheridan (also creator of Yellowstone, 1883, Sicario, Hell or High Water, Wind River, etc). Sheridan has become one of the best writers in Hollywood and he hits another home run with this one. This While the acting is fantastic, the writing is just as good as the show will keep you entertained. It has everything you want in a great show...action, drama, suspense, twists, etc. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and wanting more. We need more shows like this!",/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2022,Supermanfan-13,9," Amazing!
","Mayor of Kingstown is every bit as good as I had hoped for. This show has easily become one of my favorite new shows. With a star studded cast that includes Jeremy Renner, Kyle Chandler, Aiden Gillen and Dianne Wiest it's pretty hard to go wrong. Also, Taylor Sheridan (creator of Yellowstone, 1883, Sicario, Hell or High Water, Wind River, etc) has become one of the best writers in Hollywood and hits another home run with this one. This show has it all...action, drama, suspense, twists, etc. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and wanting more. I absolutely loved it and can't wait for future seasons!",/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2022,gilesadhamilton,9," Visceral
","Brutal, bleak, relentless, thrilling, brilliant TV. The grubby underside of the American Dream laid bare. Superbly acted and filmed without pity. I've knocked one star off for the extremely irritating Diane West character whose virtue signalling is utterly extraneous.",/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2021,Ed-Shullivan,10," Gritty series, corruption permeates the air in Kingstown as destitute men live only long enough to await their imminent demise as street justice is meted out
",This series has already shown its potential as a top notch crime/drama TV series just based on the first episode. Jeremy Renner is a bona fide A-lister film star who signed on to this TV series knowing just how well written it was and which includes a stellar supporting cast of TV and film stars that will allow the series to keep its audience glued to the series episodes each week which I am sure will continue for a few seasons more.,/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2021,joeyford-55342,8," well written dark stuff
","Renner is perfect in this roll. He is the brother of the Mayor. The mother plays a depressing, liberal history teacher who hates the world. Lots of good stuff, some nudity, some violence. A well balanced cops and robber drama. This one has legs.",/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2021,bhester0806,8," Great start, lots of directions this can go
","I'm excited to see where they are taking this. The general plot is a great idea and leaves open a kind of Sopranos-SOA-Justified-Shield-ish type vibe where it can go a lot of places and show a lot of angles. Ignore the negative reviews, anyone who writes off a show based on one episode, or the first 15 minutes of one episodes has no business leaving reviews because their opinion becomes invalid from a lack of depth.",/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2021,mkayseryan,10," Taylor Sheridan
","Thank you sir , really you get what people want to see. This man understands drama he really does. He's running 3 shows that are absolutely brilliant. Thank you brother you are helping me out a lot.",/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2022,A_Different_Drummer,9," Taking risks pays off
","One of the most hard hitting dramas in TV history. Makes CITY ON A HILL look like a sitcom. Renner finally gets to show his acting chops. Whether the audience will appreciate this is another matter entirely. Wow. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer."" Please check out my list ""167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))",/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2021,jgathings-95761,10," Show is DOPE!! Soooo Grittty and Dark! 10/10!
","My kinda show right here. Dark, gritty, smart, unnerving at times. Hopefully it gets renewed for season 2 cus Jeremy Renner is KILLING IT!! If you liked Sons of Anarchy, Breaking Bad, Bloodline, The Sopranos, or Escape at Danamora it definitely falls into that klan of shows that are very adult and dramatic and violent.",/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2022,lwmswm,9," Excellent Across The Board
","Mostly fast paced. Solid action, production values and acting. I seldom give 9 stars but this series is a easy 9. R rated for violence and nudity. Not for kids.",/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2022,BenzoEnzoMk2,9," S1 = WOW
",Season 1 is BRILLIANT.,/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2021,horst69,7," Really good
","Good story telling, good characters and cast, well paced and competently executed .",/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2022,RobbieRedeyez,8," Decent series , very good Renner
","While watching this first season , at times i felt this is really good , but overall i do think its not the level of the absolute topseries .",/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2022,natashialw,10," Greatest drama series in a long time!
",Wow! Just finished binging season 1 and cannot wait for season 2. Such an action packed thrilling drama that hits deep and keeps you watching non stop! Jeremy Renner is superb as always and great in these types of roles! The entire cast has done well and cannot wait to see what season 2 unfolds! I hope this show can get 5 seasons or more! So much to work with for all these characters and their development and wanting to dive more into Mike's past even!,/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2021,KOOLAIDBRO,10," The show started and I was lost, but
",This show is awesome. Renner has made me into a believer in him. It's dark and gritty complete with a dealer in a lawn chair with a cooler full of dope.,/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2022,xmike-25541,10," THIS is PHENOMENAL
","Not a SINGLE MINUTE in this entire series is a waste of time. Stunning Jeremy leads 100% great cast. Every character is believable, story is original and perfectly crafted/escalated. If you watched (like me) ""We own this city"" and got disappointed then trust me, this series is what BernthalÂ´s series should have been.",/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,obeidallahmohmmed,8," Such an epic show
",The best of what i have seen of Jeremy's works so far after Wind River. This show has its own dim atmosphere with intense events. No shred of boredom will enter while watching this series. The events are organised and well set in a really heated environment. Just mind-blowing.,/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2021,Dimakovtun,8," Rare pearl in the genre
",Criminal dramas aren't something new. They are usually cheap to produce and are based on cliches. That's why majority of those are bad.,/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,ZinQ,9," Bloody brilliant!
","Best thing on TV for a very long time. Only 9, as it was a little hard to follow at times. Cannot wait for the second season. A really good hard hitting show.",/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2021,Chrispearce2,8," As commented very gritty and grim
",This is not always an easy watch in its gritty realisms. Episode 2 was particularly hard hitting for me. I would definitely recommend it if this would be your cup of tea. A very good turn by Jeremy Renner.,/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2021,darrel076,10," This is the series I've been waiting for.!
","Well casted, awesome story and filled with all the good stuff. I wish I had waited for it be complete so I could have binged the season. Anyone giving this less then 8 needs to get their head checked.",/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2022,danielcereto,9," The Shield meets Prison Break
","Mayor of Kingstown season 1 is a masterpiece. It's like you get inside the soul of The Wire and The Shield, and mix with best of Prison Break. The result is an amazing solid uncommon and risky piece of art.",/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2021,bbigdiddle,9," Yes
","Gritty, Dark & continuously intriguing. Is there ANY genre Taylor Sheridan won't eventually tackle. Man, what a writer & show runner. He seems to be broadening out while sticking to what he seems to know. I will at least look in to anything he does. I cannot say that about many nowadays.",/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2022,tb4now,9," Another hit for Taylor Sheridan
","This new show is awesome!!! I could not stop watching it, and as a result I saw the whole season in 2 days. My only complaint is that it almost makes all law enforcement look like the bad guys, and makes almost all the bad guys look like the good ones. But still, a great story, and great acting. I can hardly wait for Season 2. There is going to be a season 2 right?",/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2022,Moe_Wishah,10," Truly Amazing
","I never knew Jeremy Renner can be so grit, badass, and emotional all at the same time. What is so great about this show is that its so real.",/review/rw8524849/?ref_=tt_urv
