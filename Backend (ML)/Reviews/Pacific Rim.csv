20 June 2008,ametaphysicalshark,," Great entertainment delivered in a visually stylish package
","Guillermo Del Toro's ""Hellboy"" is really the sort of comic book adaptation that should be commonplace- a film that feels every bit like a comic book in its energy, style, and visual feel, but is entirely worthy on a cinematic level as well.",/review/rw4521357/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2007,Quinoa1984,8," Guillermo Del-Toro's exciting, fun tribute to the flamboyantly cool powers of comic books
","Hellboy is self-conscious, perhaps, but in the best ways possible. Actually, it's more due to writer/director Toro being very aware of what makes up the conventional bits to every sense character-wise to the world of a comic-book, but also what can be entertaining as well, than it is just to having it being a Hellboy movie where the comic-book Hellboy already exists IN this world (guy sees the Hellboy comic, looks up, it's Hellboy!). We get the tough-as-nails, dryly witty, and possibly ticking-time-bomb hero in Hellboy, a deadly serious villain in Rasputin (yes, Rasputin, with a blonde Nazi as his evil side-kick no less), the young apprentice to the hero (Ruper Evans as John Meyers), the hero's love interest (Liz Sherman played by Selma Blair), the father figure (John Hurt's Professor), and the reluctant 'boss' (Jeffrey Tambor), not to mention the plucky side mutant in Abraham (Doug Jones) AND a magnificent creature in that hard-ass slug. They're all there, bright as day (or dark, depending on point of view), and it all works wonderfully due to Toro running with it all head on. It's not done in a way that's meant to pander to the audience, either, but just to have fun with the conventions, to see what makes them all crackle and pop under big-time special effects. It's not quite a guilty pleasure because Toro is also a smart craftsman.",/review/rw4521357/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2005,BrandtSponseller,10," One of the best comic book films
","Towards the end of World War II, the Nazis engage in efforts to win the war through means of invoking the paranormal. They attempt to open a ""portal"" for seven beings who are meant to invoke the apocalypse on Earth, but a U.S. Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense is on hand to stop them before they get too far. They do not stop them as quickly as they'd like, however, and the U.S. troops soon discover that a bizarre infant, part devil, part man, red, with horns and the demonic works, with a large right hand made of indestructible stone, has gotten through. They acquire the infant, we go forward in time to the late 20th Century, and most of the film concerns an adult Hellboy still working in conjunction with the U.S. government to help battle monsters and the paranormal.",/review/rw4521357/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2008,loganx-2,8," Red Horns Do It Better...
","Great comic series, good times on screen. Del Toro doesn't capture the shadowiness and the Gothic art of the books, but does the get the heart of the material, and plays it well between lighthearted comedy, lighthearted action, and as much weirdness(talking corpses, psychic merman, pyroknesis, Rasputin, clockwork Nazi assassins, and Cthulu, to name a few of the flourishes), as the story can handle.",/review/rw4521357/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2018,bowmanblue,9," They don't make 'em like they used to
","If ever there was a film that probably shouldn't work, it was one about a reformed demon, born during World War II and designed to help the Nazis take over the world, but now spends his time slaying monsters and saving the world instead. 'Hellboy' was a film made in 2004 and came just before the massive resurgence in comic book adaptations which, to this day, still dominates the Box Office with superhero movies. It's a strange kind of film that, although popular enough to generate (and equally good, in my opinion) sequel, it never got the third part to send off the character and give him the trilogy of films that us die-hard fans felt that he deserved. The reason I say it's 'strange' is because (like many, I guess) I never knew much about the film before watching it at the cinema. I didn't know it was based on a comic and merely saw the posters advertising the movie prior to its release. I knew that (the ever brilliant) Ron Perlman was in it and that was enough for me. The fact that much marketing material centred on a giant demon silhouette sporting a huge firearm was merely a bonus for an action/horror fan like myself. ",/review/rw4521357/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Good
","I've been slowly making my way through Guillermo del Toro's catalogue of movies and this is my first time watching Hell Boy. If you're a Del Toro fan, then this one won't disappoint. He's such a superior director - he adds artistry to this action film through his use of shot making, pacing and colour. At times, the dialogue attempts to be a bit too cute and the love story adds little to the plot, but overall, it's a fun movie that doesn't try to overextend itself.",/review/rw4521357/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2004,rbverhoef,7," Entertaining comic book movie
","When you are watching a comic book movie you have to take certain things for granted. The superpowers, strange villains, things like that. They are there in a non-existing world; saying they are implausible is true but not relevant. What a comic book movie needs is a nice story that is set in its own world (although real existing places can be there too), an entertaining superhero played by an actor who is able to really create the character, spectacular visual effects that fit the action but most of all it needs to breath the right mood. 'Spider-Man 2' did a perfect job, 'X2', 'Blade II' and now 'Hellboy' come very close. The difference is that 'Hellboy' is the first from what will probably become a series.",/review/rw4521357/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2007,pugheaven,8," Quality comic book capers
","What a cracking little film this is, haven't seen it since the cinema in 04' and it's better now than then with some sensational effects. Great script with Ron doing a splendid job. I've never read comics as I don't like them, but I'd go so far as to say, apart from Batman, this is the best comic book to movie tie in ages... not cheesy, just the right amount of comedy in it and good solid acting. Music could've done with a alittle more inspriation, but this film looks great with some lovely lit scenes especially when hellboy is in the snow, he looks fanastic ;-)",/review/rw4521357/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2008,garlonuss,8," An amazing spectacle
","This movie is a fun watch, but mainly because of Ron Perlman. The action is well done and the story is great, but Perlman makes the character of Hellboy (a demon raised by ""the good guys"") just amazingly human, with a wry sense of humor. You would be hard pressed to find anyone anywhere who could do this character as well as Perlman, let alone better. The physicality seems to have been tailor made to fit Perlman's features and the delivery of the lines is just so understatedly comedic that there are few who could pull it off at all.",/review/rw4521357/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2016,Leofwine_draca,9," Creative and colourful comic book romp
","Guillermo del Toro's follow-up to the successful BLADE II is another film in the same spirit: playful script, strong action and excellent set design. HELLBOY is another in the recent line of pretty decent comic book hero adaptations, and hey, what do you know, it's a pretty decent film. Perhaps not the masterpiece I had hoped it to be, but definitely as good as BLADE II and popular enough at the box office to warrant a sequel. After years of solid roles in support, Ron Perlman finally gets the lead role he so richly deserves, and he is brilliant as Hellboy, the wisecracking, bright red, half-human half-demon superhero who has a huge stone hand and files his horns away every morning. Perlman's make-up is excellent giving him that fine balance between dodgy realism and comic-book colourfulness and really, his character can't be faulted at all.",/review/rw4521357/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2007,Ithorianjedimaster2,9," A highly over-looked movie that surpasses Van Helsing
","Someone told me a long time ago that ""Van Helsing"" and ""Hellboy"" were in the same level of quality, saying they ""both sucked"". Well, that's a filthy lie. What you have here is a movie (based on a popular comic book of the same name) that does EVERYTHING that it seems ""Van Helsing"" slipped on. Don't get me wrong; I liked ""Van Helsing"", but let's face it, it wasn't the best movie ever and it lacked a lot of character development and an ending that was a bit of a cliffhanger (because you never find out what Van Helsing's past is), but ""Hellboy"" is another story.",/review/rw4521357/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2004,has_no_pseudonym,7," Hellboy, not perfect, but entertaining.
","Let's be blunt, the movie is, in essence, a little lumbering and flawed and has a rather odd climax. The beginning is overlong and vaguely too fantastical, but once you realize this is a very different world, a comic book really, and normal rules don't apply, it can be forgiven. In fact most of the flaws can be forgiven because of Ron Perlman and what he brought to the picture.",/review/rw4521357/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2008,bkoganbing,8," The Hellboy Cottage Industry
",If Mike Mignola isn't careful he's going to have a whole cottage industry devoted to his comic strip creation Hellboy. Having just come from Hellboy II: The Golden Army and seeing his credits at this website makes me think about what a gold mine Mignola has found.,/review/rw4521357/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2005,ghoulieguru,7," Hell of a Movie!
","Alright, so seeing as how I'm comment #430, I don't imagine that anyone is going to read my review, or that anyone will be encouraged to watch Hellboy because of anything that I'll say. There are others who have written short novels on IMDb about what a great movie this is, so there's no point in me doing more of the same.",/review/rw4521357/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2004,hannibalw,," Great Film- Possible Tent Pole
","Hell Boy is a near classic of great proportion as played by the underrated Ron Perlman(Beauty and the Beast ) Perlman is an actor you probabley wouldn't recognize as he has had to wear so much facial make up in his career but he imbues 'Hell Boy' with a real humanity and a scathing wit .""How am I ever gonna get a girl when I drive around in a garbage truck ? "" John Hurt as his father has little to do but that he loves Hell Boy there is no doubt having rescued him on the night he came from hell . Dr. Broom adopts the boy and they live at the Center For Paranormal Studies in New Jersey with a fish like creature and a fire starter girl who Hell Boy loves to pieces . I hope that this becomes a tent pole series for the studio as I would like to see Hell Boy in other situations . Five of 5 stars for 'Hell Boy'",/review/rw4521357/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2004,rcavellero,9," AMAZING!
","I must say I would have never expected in my wildest dreams to enjoy a film like this so much, much less this one.  Hellboy has it's faults but it's truly comic book/horror/fantasy hybrid masterpiece. It is the probably the best comic book movie I've ever seen. Based on a little known comic book I'm sure people will be running to buy now. Hellboy is the story of a group of bad guys whom are trying to destroy the world and end up bringing forth a small child like hellboy. After years of being raised by his founder he becomes a superhero monster fighting bad guys like himself and bringing them to justice while defending humanity. He's helped along in his quest by pyro girl Liz Sherman played beautifully by Selma Blair. And a very cool intellectual fish Looking guy referred to as Blue. But those people are back to destroy the world again as they have ressurected their master and it's up to Hellboy and his gang of misfits to protect humanity and foil their plan. I'm sure it sounds surely predicatble but that something this film lacks in troves. It's completely original, completely new and just great. The performances by Ron Pearlman, John Hurt and Selma Blair are completely involving. The story is well developed, emotional, scary and funny. The direction is taut and well developed. Definatly Del Toro's reigning masterpiece. I must say I was overly impressed by this film probably because I wasn't expecting too much but I can guarantee you one thing I will be going to see it again. Hellboy is amazing!",/review/rw4521357/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2005,Boba_Fett1138,6," Quite stylish but somewhat disappointing movie.
","Director Guillermo del Toro already showed with his previous movies that he has a great visual style. ""Hellboy"" is no exception and it has a great dark comic book atmosphere. Too bad that the story and most of the characters don't really work out the way they're supposed to.",/review/rw4521357/?ref_=tt_urv

2 April 2004,morris8277,9," An awesome thrill-ride
","I'm usually pretty skeptical about comic book to film translations thanks to such esteemed turkeys as ""Captain America"", ""Daredevil"", and ""Punisher"" (the early 90's version with Dolph Lundgren). But this movie, which could've been bad.....real bad, somehow found a way to be ammusing and entertaining, while at the same time staying faithful to the comics original characters, storylines, and influences.",/review/rw4521357/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2013,A_Different_Drummer,10," Did I miss the stargate to the alternate film dimension?
","I look at the IMDb review tally and I have to wonder aloud whether I missed the Stargate to the alternate film dimension where every director is as good as Del Toro, and therefore every film is as good as Hellboy?? Because only in such an alternate dimension, where such films are commonplace, would the mediocre score be justified. Lets get to the point. Tel Toro is one of the greatest living directors, period. Although I did not ""love"" MAMA, for example, as a total experience, I was mesmerized. That's what Del Toro does. He mesmerizes. (I did love the Orphanage, one of the greatest horror films of all time and largely unknown in NA). But what makes this production extra-special is Perlman. In case anyone missed it, Ron is a solid actor whose career by and large is one B-movie after another. And, if he is not starring in a B-Movie, then he is in a supporting role in an A-movie -- eg, Driver. Here, Ron not only gets to star but steals scene after scene. For all his size and presence, he manages to present Hellboy both as a capable hero and at the same time a fratboy jealous of his girl (Blair.) As much as I loved the sequel (it was great) I gave a top score to this one because of the sheer joy of discovery the viewer gets to experience when encountering this team (Del Toro, Blair, Perlman) for the very first time.",/review/rw4521357/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2019,jamesrupert2014,8," Good, demi-demonic fun
","During a secret Nazi paranormal experiment in Scotland, a red and horned child from the nether-regions crosses into our reality. He grows up to be 'Hellboy', an agent of 'The Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense' and becomes our hope when a reborn Rasputin unleashes a fecund demon as part of a plan to bring about an 'end-of-days' apocalypse. Typical of a Guillermo del Toro film, the imagery is striking, especially the brief scenes of a post-apocalyptic Earth. The characters, drawn from the 'Hellboy' series of graphic novels (created by Mike Mignola, which I have not read) are imaginative and engaging and the production team do an excellent job in bringing them to the screen. I particularly liked Kroenen (Ladislav Beran), the self-mutilating, 'clockwork' Nazi assassin, the character design and make-up is outstanding. Ron Perlman, also under a lot of makeup, is quite good playing the wisecracking titular demi-demon, as are Doug Jones (equally made-up) as Abe Sapien, the PBRD's amphibious scholar-agent, and the ever-moribund John Hurt as Prof. Bruttenholm, Hellboy's adoptive father. All in all, a great 'superhero' film: clever, fast-moving, fun, and much more imaginative than most of the films in the better known DC or MCU franchises.",/review/rw4521357/?ref_=tt_urv

","Nearly 15 years ago, Ron Perlman made his comic book debut in a movie called Hellboy which became a surprise hit at the box office. Based on a classic graphic novel and directed by the guy who would go on to win an oscar for ""The Shape of Water"", ""Hellboy"" is an amazing work of art that has to be seen to believe.
