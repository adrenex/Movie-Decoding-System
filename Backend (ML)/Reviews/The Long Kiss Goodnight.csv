","Room in Rome is the story of a short-lived physical and emotional liaison between two women in a hotel room in the last night of summer. It would be a night of intense discovery, a tour de force between two ways of seeing life, love and sex.",/review/rw6154123/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2010,Herakhthor,10," Beautiful, poetic, profound...and very sensual!!!
","I had the great fortune to see this film at the closing gala of the Festival del Cine Español en Màlaga. I have been a great fan of the work of Julio Medem ever since I saw 'La Ardilla Roja' some 15 years ago. And his latest film doesn't disappoint either. However, it is in some ways a departure for him. He said so himself at the press conference the day before the screening. He called it the 'most simple film' he has made so far. This is certainly true as the story is quite straightforward and (apart from a few small scenes), the entire film concentrates on its 2 female protagonists. It is no secret that the film is based on the Chilean film 'En la cama' by Matias Bize. But Medem has made the material entirely his own and developed it in a completely different way. The only things in common with the previous film is that they both charter the encounter of 2 people who only just met during one night in a hotel room. But that's where the similarities stop. Of course the biggest difference is that here the protagonists are both women. Ever since 'Lucia y el sexo' Medem has been concentrating more and more on the exploration of the female psyche. This was most evident in his previous film, the (apart from the end) masterful, yet very misunderstood 'Caotica Ana'. But whereas that film ambitiously delved into deep philosophical questions about the subjugation of the female over 2,000 years of patriarchy, here this exploration takes a simpler, though no less profound form - the exploration of female love & sensuality. Having 2 women instead on a mixed couple (or 2 men for that matter), allowed Medem to concentrate on this aspect without any distraction. He said at the press conference that for a number of years now he has been discovering and exploring his own feminine side. And it is exactly this which gives the film its universal appeal, instead of being 'just a lesbian' tale. The feelings and sentiments expressed & shown will resonate with every viewer, regardless of their sex and/or sexual orientation. This is probably also in no small way due to the involvement of both actresses in the shaping of their characters as well as the final script (Medem re-wrote the screenplay a number of times to incorporate their inputs & ideas). And their respective performances are excellent. There is real chemistry between Elena Anaya and Natasha Yarovenko - without this the film just wouldn't have worked. Both give very subtle and nuanced performances as what begins as just a night of fun & sex gradually turns into something far deeper as both characters realise they are falling in love, something neither had bargained for. Guarded at first, telling each stories which may or may not be true, both women start bit by bit to reveal more about themselves until in the end their souls are as naked as their bodies. A couple of months ago a so-called promo circulated on the internet, cobbled together from stolen material from the first week of shooting, which suggests the film is no more than a voyeuristic soft-core fest. But nothing could be further from the truth! Yes, both are naked most of the films running time, and yes, there is some sex. But the sex is beautifully filmed and essential within the story line. And the fact that they are naked is just that, a natural fact! They would be, given the situation, and one soon forgets about it. What matters are the characters and the way they develop and interact with each other. Being quasi a 2-hander, the film does have quite a theatrical feel. Most of the dialogue is in English. That seems only natural, as one girl is Spanish and the other Russian, both meeting in Italy. This allows for some poignant moments when neither can really express what their feel in this foreign language and start speaking in their own tongues - which, of course, the other can't understand. But Medem also works with silences - some of the most profound realizations happen just with facial expressions. Intervowen in all this are the directors trademark poetic touch, with references to philosophy, art & history, as well as to his own films - there is even a reference to his next project, Aspasia (look her up on Wikipedia!). Coupled with excellent, atmospheric camera work (well, it is a Julio Medem film after all) and an evocative soundtrack with music by Jocelyn Pook and Russian Red, this is a deeply touching and satisfying film, one that stays with you. At least for me, but judging by the long standing ovation for Medem, Elena Anaya, Natasha Yavorenko plus the film's producer, Alvaro Longoria at the end, I don't seem to be the only one who feels like that.",/review/rw6154123/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2011,GOWBTW,," Deep and enticing!
","When I first watched this movie, I wasn't going to give it a negative thought to it. It was very mind soothing, very sexual, very erotic, it was very interesting to see. When you spending a night in a very exotic locale, you just want to let it loose. You have two young ladies who happen to room together for the night. They spent their times naked, talking about things they do, who they met, what their professions are. Despite their differences, they build a common bond which a memory that will last for a lifetime. The shower scene is classic. Closeness is always going to be a factor here. Now I have be working at a hotel, anything goes from closed doors. No inhibitions were shown, insecurities were not visible there. Rome is romantic for anyone who want to get away, so as the old saying goes ""When in Rome, anything goes"". This movie is not your typical late-night choice, and it is for late night viewing only! 4 out of 5 stars!",/review/rw6154123/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2011,ThrowntoReality,7," Nothing special, yet beautiful and touching
","There is no real reason why I should like this film. There are literally hundreds of films like this. Two people who've never met each other before fall in love over night and it's all because of coincidental circumstances. We've seen it before, a thousand times.",/review/rw6154123/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2011,davmun3,9," Intoxicating
","Julio Medem's ""Room in Rome"" is the tale of a Spanish lesbian who, one night in Rome, picks up a Russian girl who has never been with a woman before. At first the girl is nervous and after some foreplay in the lesbian's hotel room, she gets cold feet and sneaks away while the other girl is sleeping. But she has forgotten her mobile phone. She returns to the hotel room and knocks on the door. The other girl answers the door naked just as a waiter comes to deliver food to the room next door. She doesn't cover herself up but tells the waiter they may want some food later. And so begins a night of games, fantasies, laughter, love-making and the baring of souls as well as bodies.",/review/rw6154123/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2015,CineMuseFilms,8," A bitter-sweet love story beyond gender boundaries
","This is a film with a beautifully simple narrative arc, all focused on one night and one space. An experienced lesbian seduces a novice...they spend a night in a room in Rome where their naked physicality merges with Renaissance art in a small world that is transformed through loving a stranger....all the makings of another homo-erotic love tale with high-brow artistic flourishes and a haunting musical score to carry the story to the high watermark. But this film genuinely cuts new ground: it is full of surprises, twists, and exquisitely painful turns. The acting is playful, vibrant, and the interactions erotically natural, giving the film a power not found in the genre factories. Definitely on my short list of all-time favourite films.",/review/rw6154123/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2012,cartmanandme,10," Amazing iconic movie
","This movie is not for the people who cannot understand love. I use to believe that love was only heterosexual, but after seeing actors portray the genitility of love so elegantly, my world had changed. This movie should receive every award, from best picture to best actor. Also the song choice is stunning. Loving Stranger, could not have been a better choice. This movie is sentimental, lustful, and relates to something everyone can understand, which is why in my opinion it is a classic. To the actors, and director I bid them a fine job, and this movie will go down in the histories, as one of the greats if not the great.",/review/rw6154123/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2016,RodrigAndrisan,," Super film
","The film, first of all, has a superb music. Then it is filmed in a unique manner, intimate, full of intensity, the camera penetrates slowly into the core of the soul of the two female characters, two young women who fall in love with each other during a night in a hotel room in Rome. The two actresses, Elena Anaya and Natasha Yarovenko, shows not only their physical beauty, but a small part of the beauty of the human soul. It's a love story, very sensitive, it is not soft-porn. The most intense moment of the film is when Alba and Natacha are singing the Italian song ""Volare"" in the bathroom. Although all the action takes place only in that hotel room, the movie is not boring at all, can be seen with pleasure, and 2nd and 3rd time.",/review/rw6154123/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2020,douglasransom,8," Intriguing
","When I first saw this in my local movie store, my first thought was ""this is just going to be softcore."" When I watched it, I was intrigued by it.

Overall, very, very good.",/review/rw6154123/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2010,molibden_smith,10," it made me feel
","First, I saw this film in September. In October I had a chance to see it on a big screen at the Baltic Pearl Festival in Riga. I have to say, that this film can be seen more than once. You can watch it over and over again and every time you'll get a pleasure. First of all, great directing, the music was just amazing, camera operator did a great job, and acting: Elena Anaya played her part perfectly - she can smile as a child, in a few seconds she can cry as it really hurts. Amazing! I respect this actress! Natasha Yarovenko can not be compared with Anaya. I don't know if she is an actress,but if she is, then not the best one. But(!) that was the raisin of the whole movie, Natasha was so unprofessional, that it made me believe that this story really happens. I mean this Russian accent, sometimes she looked just stupid, but are we perfect in reality? Natasha made me believe in everything that happened that night in Rome, Alba made me feel every single emotion as if I were there in that hotel room.",/review/rw6154123/?ref_=tt_urv

At beginning of the movie i just thought that the sex was hot(purely in my animal way). but when the movie preceded i was,like , this is what a love should feel like. at this point i want to say that i'm not gay(whatsoever).when i was at one point of the movie, if anyone were to ask me 'what is the most beautiful thing in the world?""..i answer would've been ""mmm, i don't know,lesbian!"".",/review/rw6154123/?ref_=tt_urv
