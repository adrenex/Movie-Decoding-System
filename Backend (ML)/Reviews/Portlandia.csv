15 October 2006,MovieAddict2016,7," A witty satire that doesn't take sides on the smoking controversy.
","A clever satire of the spin-world (thanks largely to its cast and a witty script by Jason Reitman), Thank You For Smoking comes on like Wag the Dog via The Insider Â– it's a painfully honest insight into the tobacco industry, led by the narration of Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), the Big Tobacco corporation's chief spokesman. His narcissistic self-infatuation (""Charles Manson kills people; I talk."") and sleazy tactics land him in trouble when he finds himself bribing a lung cancer victim in front of his pre-teen son, who is not yet old enough to smoke but is being influenced by his money-driven father.",/review/rw1336287/?ref_=tt_urv

24 March 2006,bitcetc,8," Inhale
","You'll need to inhale, then exhale slowly and relax before plunging into the world of Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), lobbyist and bag man for the Tobacco Industry. The laughs are some of the best abdominal exercise I've ever had at the movies. Thank You for Smoking is far and away the best satire to come out of Hollywood in years. The last attempt I remember was WAG THE DOG. This film is far better at true satire, its wit biting do-gooders and do-badders alike. It has been too long since Satire and the Politically Incorrect Sense of Humor have been allowed to point out the absurd in all sides of an issue. If you don't laugh out loud, your sense of humor has become a casualty of malpractice by the Doctors of Spin and the Nursemaids of Political Correctness.",/review/rw1336287/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2008,Chrysanthepop,," 'Argument Or Negotiation?'
","Jason Reitman's 'Thank You For Smoking' is a remarkable satire about successful 'B***S***ting'. Oh the things one can get away with, the things one can turn around and twist just through words, charisma and a smile. All the characters are/were hypocrites. Even in the relationship between Nick and his son, we see how his own traits brush off on his son. Not only that, he teaches his own son how to get away with things just by using words. Reitman's execution and screenplay are very intriguing. He uses clever humour and the lines spoken by the actors are absurdly amazing and hilarious. The multiple meanings of the lines particularly stand-out. Also, Reitman's intentions in making this successful satire seem very genuine as the film is not pretentious nor condescending (as is the case with many of the so-called recent satires). There's a stellar cast of which all the actors (except Katie Holmes) naturally fit their parts. Aaron Eckhart carries the film. It's difficult to describe his performance in words as the actor seems to pulls it off with ease. Nick Naylor was meant for him. Acclaimed actors like William Huffman Macy, Maria Bello, Rob Lowe and Robert Duvall all do nothing short of excellence in their acting. Even Adam Brody provokes laughter. Katie Holmes is the weakest link but this can be easily overlooked as she's not there for long and the other actors compensate enough. The cinematography and background score are very effective and the visuals are impressive. The sepia tone and brightness gives the feeling of a classic movie where things are positively exaggerated. While some people find the film offensive because they think it promotes smoking but 'Thank You For Smoking' is not really about smoking. It's pretty much about politics. Political Incorrectness. I'll be watching this movie again because it deserves so.",/review/rw1336287/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2006,paxatron,," ""Thank You"" for a good satire!
","First of all, sorry for the cheesy title. I couldn't help myself. Second of all, ""Thank You for Smoking"" is, in fact, a darn good satire - one of the best I've seen since ""Election"". Aaron Eckhart holds the picture together with a witty, charismatic performance as a tobacco lobbyist. The film is basically about his profession as he spins the news, pitches a movie idea, dodges a subpoena, has an affair with a reporter (Katie Holmes), tries to spend time with his son (Cameron Bright), and has lunch with an alcohol lobbyist (Maria Bello) and a firearms rep (David Koechner) - where they literally compare body counts. The performances are excellent across the board, from William H. Macy's crusading Senator to Rob Lowe's smirking Hollywood agent who struts around his office in a kimono. Even Adam Brody is enjoyable as Lowe's hyperactive assistant whose in-joke with a co-worker earned one of the biggest laughs of the movie.",/review/rw1336287/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2007,claudio_carvalho,8," For the Mortgage
","The chief spokesperson and lobbyist Nick Taylor (Aaron Eckhart) is the Vice-President of the Academy of Tobacco Studies. He is talented in speaking and spins argument to defend the cigarette industry in the most difficult situations. His best friends are Polly Bailey (Maria Bello) that works in the Moderation Council in alcohol business, and Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner) of the gun business own advisory group SAFETY. They frequently meet each other in a bar and they self-entitle the Mod Squad a.k.a. Merchants of Death, disputing which industry has killed more people. Nick's greatest enemy is Vermont's Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy), who defends in the Senate the use a skull and crossed bones in the cigarette packs. Nick's son Joey Naylor (Cameron Bright) lives with his mother, and has the chance to know his father in a business trip. When the ambitious reporter Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes) betrays Nick disclosing confidences he had in bed with her, his life turns upside-down. But Nick is good in what he does for the mortgage.",/review/rw1336287/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2006,bob the moo,," Not a sharp or acerbic satire but more of a gently mocking comedy that has laughs and a consistently enjoyably tone
","Nick Naylor is a talented man who is employed as one of the top spokesmen for ""Big Tobacco"". Sure he has to keep the alleged ""truth"" about the health effects, contributing to the death of 1200 people each and every day, but he's got to pay the mortgage just like the rest of us. He is separated from his wife but still wants to be a role model to his son while also pursuing his chosen career. Summoned to meet with The General (one of the last great tobacco barons), Nick is put in charge of pushing through new ways of promoting smoking while also defeating a push by Senator Finistirre to put a skull and crossbones on the front of every cigarette packet sold in the country.",/review/rw1336287/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2006,inkblot11,9," A film so hot, it's smoking!
","Nick (Aaron Eckhart) is an attractive, scumbag lobbyist for a pro-tobacco institute. This makes it difficult to raise his young son without damaging the youngster's ability to determine what is right or wrong. There are also problems with his ex-wife, soothing but shamefaced dinners with two fellow lobbyists, and an affair with an attractive reporter (Katie Holmes) on this season's agenda. Will Nick be a hero to anyone? And is his charmed but flawed existence about to take a wrong turn? What a year for lobbyists, indeed. We have Jack Abramoff and, now, Nick Naylor. The very attractive Eckhart is superb as the man whose love for debate supersedes his ethics. Surrounding him are wonderful supporting actors, including Holmes, Robert Duvall, Maria Bello, Sam Elliot, and the talented youngster, Cameron Bright. Let's all bow to concept and top-notch script, however. The movie's storyline is the reason this film is important and laudable. Do you want to see a movie which will result in a first class conversation and coffee opportunity? See this one, absolutely.",/review/rw1336287/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2006,ArizWldcat,8," Funny movie: looks at ALL sides of the debate
","I saw this at Sundance last night (actually it was a Salt Lake screening, and thus the filmmakers didn't bother to drive 30 miles to talk to us...not that I am bitter...) At first I was a bit worried that this was going to be the old hat anti smoking movie that makes all smokers victims of the eeeeevil tobacco companies, but then I saw that it was based on a Christopher Buckley novel and I relaxed a bit! This pokes fun at all sides of the issue, from the tobacco lobbyist's insistence that there has been ""no conclusive proof"" that tobacco is harmful, to the legislator's thinking that putting a warning label on cigarettes will actually make someone pick up a cigarette package, read the label, and decide not to smoke...as if ANYONE with half a brain doesn't know that inhaling smoke into your lungs will harm you.",/review/rw1336287/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2006,missygoldstein,10," Very Good
","Very smart, funny and interesting movie. I seldom say that about any movie. The story of a lobbyist for the tobacco industry who's job is to put a spin on cigarettes, improve their image, make them cool again, and prevent one senator from getting legislature to mandate that cigarette companies place a large graphic skull and cross bones on each pack sold.",/review/rw1336287/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2006,filmquestint,8," Coughing And Laughing In Another Planet
","Ivan Reitman must be so proud. I'm not kidding, his son Jason has come out with a caustic original comedy all his own. I don't know what people outside Los Angeles may make of this. They may think is science fiction when, in fact, most people who have spent any time there knows that this is as normal as going to church in the Vatican. The scenes inside the CAA like agency are even underplayed if you believe that. Aaron Eckhart is as perfect as they come. The charming monster with human sides. William H Macy, Rob Lowe and the rest of the cast are great fun to watch. I'm rooting for this movie to make a zillion bucks. It'll be nice to have more good writing, good acting and good direction in March for a change.",/review/rw1336287/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2006,besttom,8," Very funny edu-tainment that doesn't take sides
","I saw this movie at a screening in DC last night. It was great. Aaron Eckhart, the single leading man with the WORST haircut in Hollywood (full disclosure - I'm damn near bald) matches very well with the direction of Reitman. From the get-go, it's a fast-paced send-up of everyone and everything in the tobacco war. The entire cast does a good job (w/ the exception, maybe, of Katie Holmes). Rob Lowe is hysterical in his cameo, but I have to say Eckhart & his MOD squad buddies (Maria Bello & David Koechner) really light up the screen. Their scenes of discussing the dealing out of death through the industries they represent over drinks are a real strong point of the movie.",/review/rw1336287/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2008,billion_mucks,8," Exceptional Anti-Hero Preaches
","How does it feel to be hated by everyone? Nick Naylor is the spokesman of a cigar industry decided to ""clean"" the image of smoking. His character is poetic, from where he gets the nerve to go on with his job, to his utter manipulative skills and brave charisma. His character transforms those around him with major intelligence.",/review/rw1336287/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2006,petep,9," Remember: cholesterol kills
","This was quite the clever satire. But it's not really about smoking. I was reminded of Cinderella Man (last year's best film). That one wasn't really a boxing movie: it was about a man realizing what was important in his life, and boxing was just a means to an end. Thank You for Smoking isn't trying to convince people to smoke, or, not to smoke. It's about choice. Well, that's what the characters are lobbying for, quite literally. Maybe since this is a dark comedy, it doesn't really have any moral high ground. But Aaron Eckhart, who plays the lead role of Tobacco industry spokesperson Nick Naylor, and is playing a character who himself smokes, doesn't actually light up a cigarette on camera.",/review/rw1336287/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2006,jon.h.ochiai,10," Paying the Mortgage
","In the opening scene of ""Thank You for Smoking"", Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) Tobacco Lobbyist is a guest on the Joan Lunden Talk Show with a young boy Robin, who is a dying of lung cancer. Nick somewhat sympathetic, makes his argument that it is in his best interest to keep people like Robin alive so they can continue to smoke cigarettes. Nick proclaims that the Tobacco Industry will spend $50 million on campaign to educate kids against smoking. Nick wins over the entire studio audience for his humanitarian stance. A young woman sitting by also watching the movie, voices that ""I am very annoyed."" She might have been clued in by the movie audience laughter that satire lives and thrives in Jason Reitman's ""Thank You for Smoking"". Reitman's screenplay based on the book by Christopher Buckley (son of William Buckley), ""Thank You for Smoking"" is painfully hilarious and a clever dark comedy focused on the multi-billion dollar Tobacco Industry. Writer and Director Rietman has a similar conceit as his main character Nick Naylor as he tells his story in the context of freedom and the consequence of choiceÂ—however skewed the context. Aaron Eckhart is amazing as Nick, Time Magazine's ""Sultan of Spin"". As Nick describes himself, ""Michael Jordan plays ball. Charles Manson kills people. I talk."" His Nick Naylor is the Vice-President of the Academy of Tobacco Studies, or in English he is a Tobacco Lobbyist. He is a master at what he does. Nick is also the political target of Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy), who wants to stamp all cigarettes with a ""poison"" label.",/review/rw1336287/?ref_=tt_urv

",This was the most enjoyable film we saw at Sundance. Smart and funny is not an easy pairing to find these days.

3 September 2006,Philby-3,7," The Right Smoked Out
","Lawyers are often asked how they can act for clients who are clearly bad people who ought to be in jail. Once the arguments like ""everyone is entitled to a fair trial"" and ""everyone is presumed innocent"" are swept aside, it usually gets down to ""well, I've got a mortgage to pay."" So it is for lobbyists for unpopular industries. There is no legal industry more unpopular than Big Tobacco and in this film Aaron Eckhart plays with great relish, Nick Naylor, a superb operator with absolutely no shame who prosecutes Big Tobacco's cause at venues ranging from grade school classes to congressional committees.",/review/rw1336287/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2010,moonspinner55,6," Somewhat precious send-up of amoral big business, but with good laugh lines and an expert cast
","The moral ambiguities of a smooth-talking, quick-thinking lobbyist for the tobacco industry come under fire while he continues to work for a heartless organization that panics when cigarette sales drop even the slightest percent and cancer patients turn up on TV talk shows. Writer-director Jason Reitman, working from Christopher Buckley's novel, cleverly juggles his film's dark-hued elements with comedy in an inviting package. The filmmaker doesn't attempt to use sneaky reverse psychology on us (thankfully); instead, he boldly displays the smug recklessness of not only the tobacco industry but the squawk-boxes for the alcohol and firearms people as well. We see them for the bloodsuckers they are, bragging about doing their dirty work ""for the mortgage""--and Reitman even manages to make them funny. Aaron Eckhart was the perfect casting choice for this ""Sultan of Spin""; with his creamy pseudo-charm and unbridled arrogance, Eckhart knows just how to play the devil incarnate and make him both wily and buffoonish. Reitman's style is jaded satire in a glossy format; he wrings big laughs out of the quotable lines of dialogue, though there's no weight behind his verbal (and visual) slings and arrows. The movie's edges are blunted in its quest to be likable--it's a skewering of all the outrageous behavior we see on the news--and nothing here goes beyond the cheeky, sideways-slanted humor which deliberately dominates. **1/2 from ****",/review/rw1336287/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2007,Christopher_Reid,5," Just not that funny.
","I had high hopes for Thank You For Smoking, a satire about smoking and the way the media, politicians and people in general act in relation to the issues it generates. I found it to be disappointingly tame in its derision of the hypocrisies and manipulation of the various groups and characters in the film. Sure, it presents a number of interesting ideas, but most of them just don't really go anywhere. William H. Macy's character in particular seems plainly unoriginal and pointless.",/review/rw1336287/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2006,dhaufrect,9," ""Thank You for Smoking"". It looks good like a movie should.
","Jason Reitman has written and directed a fantastically funny film. It portrays a tobacco lobbyist, Nick Naylor, who will bend over backwards to make a buck. The part of Naylor is done exquisitely by Aaron Eckhart. His associates in crime do likewise for the alcohol and firearms industries. One of the high points of the film is the actor, Sam Elliott, portraying the Marlboro Man, Lorne Lutch, who is dying of lung cancer. He masterfully looks and sounds like the image of this former character of billboards and TV. Rob Lowe plays Jeff Megall, a Hollywood mogul, who is convinced that the plan to add cigarettes to current films will enhance his wallet as well. One expects to see a documentary on the tobacco industry, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a delightful comedy that deserves a great success. It should be on ones list of current films to see.",/review/rw1336287/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Thank You for Smoking"" does what few movies ever know how to do: it hits us all right where it hurts, pointing out everyone's hypocrisy in everything, and the way that our society is based on spin. Aaron Eckhart, whom you may remember from ""Erin Brockovich"", gets the role of a lifetime as tobacco industry spin doctor Nick Naylor, whose job it is to make his industry look good and win people over.
