9 February 2022,shane1181,9," Hilarious period dramedy
","Downton Abbey was about upstairs/downstairs affairs in the UK, while this dramedy is about old money/new money in America.",/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2022,DukeEman,8," The crumbling of manners in New York city...
","Julian Fellowes' mighty pen is back (and even more cheekier) in this lavish production. This time dealing with aristocratic socialite snobbery of the ugly kind, ruthless business affairs, political sabotaging, hidden homosexual relationships, racial prejudices, and society control freaks. (But I'm sure there is more after only viewing three episodes.)",/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2022,thiagosblancos,7," I don't get all the bad reviews...
","I've been waiting this for a while, especially since Fellowes mentioned it, I knew the premise could deliver a good show, and so it is. I'm giving it a 7* for the time being for I know it could be an 8 but I will reserve judgement until the end of the season.",/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2022,jrigler-52145,9," Wonderful!
","What's not to like? Fabulous sets, beautiful and authentic costumes, Broadway actors, and an intriguing story line. This isn't something to over-analyze; just enjoy it!!",/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2022,dpoland-76589,8," Easily triggered? Then don't watch
","Reading some of these reviews is almost as entertaining as the show itself. Some proclaim to love Downton Abbey (which by the way also raised sensitive issues such as class, heritage and sexuality) but when it makes a small subplot in an American show - the trolls emerge proclaiming ""no, no 'woke' stuff.""",/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2022,ajkbiotech,10," Great acting, nice story line, but historically implausible
",1) the show is beautifully shot,/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2022,bjarias,7," ... early-days ... nothing yet outstanding or terrible
",".. early to tell yet so far so good... nothing much new in the story.. but acting is up to the task, and it's interesting to see Streep's youngest daughter take to the small screen... we'll see how it goes.",/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2022,AvidWatcher101,10," Love it!
","Visually stunning, great stories, so engaging. Just what I needed. Kudos to Julian Fellows on another hit. In spite of some users on IMDB not liking the show, it's a hit!!! Like Mrs. Russell, it will prevail.",/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2022,VintageSoul56,8," Yes, I Will Be Watching
","I have read about how the new rich tried to infiltrate the ranks of the old rich in 19th New York. I am also reading a book by British author Anne de Coursey, ""Husband Hunter's"", about the young American heiresses who married into, mostly, British aristocracy and invigorated it with their money. Actually, it was mainly the mother's who made that happen.",/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2022,julieshotmail,7," Meryl Streep's spawn is ironically the worst actor in this series
","You can say that ""The Gilded Age"" is a knock-off of the beloved ""Downton Abbey,"" effectively showcasing the beautiful sets and award-worthy costumes, however failing miserably to come up with compelling plot lines. The multiple subplots in ""The Gilded Age"" are razor thin and just try to get by from the sheer quantity. I keep hoping for some original plot development or even shocking twists but they never come. Besides the pretty art work and costumes to look at, the talented actors do keep me glued, especially the two sisters played by Cynthia Nixon and Christine Baranski. You have to love Baranski's cool snide delivery of those memorable one-liners. Cynthia Nixon is a revelation here as Aunt Ada. I have always found her to be rather annoying in her other work, but here she is my favorite, and I look forward to every scene that she is in. The other actors, from Carrie Coon as Bertha Russell to Blake Ritson as Oscar, deliver capably as expected. However, it needs to be called out that the main protagonist, the so-called glue to all characters and all storylines, is played by an actress who is clearly out of her league. The burden of carrying the show falls on her shoulders, and her inexperience and shortcomings are in full view. Louisa Jacobson exudes zero charm as Marion Brook. She fails to make this central character sympathetic which is critical to the quality of this show. For the first few episodes I start to question why she is selected as the main actress as I am perplexed. Then I find out that she is the daughter of none-other-than the great Meryl Streep, possibly the best actress of all time. There must be an assumption that due to genetic association, Louisa has to be just as good. But here is living proof that sometimes the apple can indeed fall far from the tree.",/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2022,dbuckshnis,10," Stunning, opulent and twisted
",This period piece is delightful with opulent sets and costumes! Truly stunning works of art and twisted plots galore. The acting is fabulous! The old money versus new money theme is always a dilemma of the ages.,/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv

26 January 2022,nyccents,6," TERRIBLE casting and directing
","First of all, the main character Marion Brooks is supposed to be 17/18. I. Real life this actress is 30 and looks it. Why not cast a genuine ingenue like Bridgerton did, and make it more credible?! Louise Jacobson is a pretty girl but she is not a radiant 18 year old carrying the storyline here.",/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2022,rhmacl,5," Lavish, and talent galore! But... the writing...ugh
","OMG! Baranski! Nixon! Coons! MacDonald! This series drips with an embarrassment of talent, but the writing comes off as unnatural, and forced for rapid story movement. It seems to be trying too hard to capture the unique qualities of Downton Abby, but it's no longer new and intriguing the way Downton was.",/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2022,judgewashington,2," Julian Fellowes fared much better in England
","Everything about this series seems plastic and contrived. I adore Julian Fellowes, but his work is best done in England not in the United States, where American producers feel that overproduction makes everything better (it doesn't). The Gilded Age lacks all the charm, wit, and subtlety of Downton Abbey---the dialogue is too modern and PC, the CGI too obvious, the sets are too brightly lit (and look just like sets), the costumes are too immaculate, and many of the actresses have had a distracting amount of face-work (particularly Christine Baranski). Where's Dame Maggie Smith with her sagging jowls and her innate sense of superiority when you really need her? There's a Gay subplot that seems forced, and people of color are treated far more unrealistically than they were at the time. Overall, the series attempts to be historical while mirroring contemporary culture, making it both inaccurate and slightly ridiculous.",/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2022,conway3000,10," Entertaining Show
",I am enjoying The Gilded Age and will continue to view weekly. We are still in the process of being introduced getting to know the characters. Julian Fellow's knows how to weave a tale so I suspect the story will get more complex as the series unfolds.,/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2022,jakebrann,1," Holy hell it's bad!
","Are they kidding right now with this 8 star rating? I made it exactly 21 minutes into the first episode and couldn't take any more of the horrible acting. The woman gets her purse stolen at the train station and does absolutely nothing, doesn't yell out that her purse was just stolen, quietly sits there and cries when it literally happened 10 seconds before? Forget this one! Seriously though the acting is so bad and phony.",/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2022,trademarcdesigns,3," Disappointing
","I'm afraid I wasn't very impressed with this show. The sets are opulent, the costuming is above average, but that's all there is - it's as if they put all their efforts into creating some great visuals, but forgot all the important things. The story is simplistic, the dialog is stilted and contrived, and the acting is lackluster. I am assuming the real fault lies with a bad script and poor direction because that many actors can't all be this bad - it has to be that they have very little to work with.",/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2022,efd-10467,8," Harmless Fun with a touch of historic interest
","This is a well made light hearted show, the interesting part is the view of New York at that time, the money and opulence of the ruling class, it makes for a lighthearted change to the endless sex and violence.",/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2022,sophiakjaer,1," nothing is saved!
","The plot, the writing and the acting are just HORRIBLE and I say that being kind carie coon is bad It's not worth you wasting your precious time watching this! But if you enjoy watching grown-ups act and act like kids, this show is for you!",/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2022,DJWinston,7," Is overacting for the camera a thing now?
","Okay, so I did think most of the people onscreen were badly miscast. But that being said, they are all talented folks. So why the major overacting from about half of them? Without mentioning names, so much excess facial ticking and looks and snorts and sighs that make absolutely no sense. Is it because too many of them have too much live theater in their blood? Just cool it. Cut it back by half. Just stand there and say your lines with intention, not ticks. Even if you don't move a muscle, the camera will get it all.",/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2022,kgft,6," C'mon Julian, get it together!
","I love Downton Abbey so much that during shut down I binged it for a second and third time. I'm also a huge fan of Christine Baranski, so I was really looking forward to this new series. I haven't been happy with it and after the second episode I realized why. There are few endearing characters like there are in Downton Abbey, and Christine Baranski plays a relentlessly cruel, obnoxious snob, displaying almost none of the delicious wit that she usually shows. The other characters are poorly fleshed out so far. All this is the fault of the writer; I don't know what he was thinking beyond laurel-resting. I'm going to give it a few more chances, but if something doesn't improve it will never make it to season two, at least for me.",/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2022,wht1knight,4," A brave attempt
","Following the success of Downton Abbey, there were hopes for this show, but the grace and awe of country castle do not transfer to the US in this show. The first episode sets the tone and context for the story and characters, but the gaps weaknesses in this show are too obvious. The use of green screen to create old golden age rooms is too obvious and the result is something akin to a Star Trek video game from the 1990s; I am guessing sets and locations could not be provided. The digital house staff just look awful.",/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2022,info-42423,1," Where's the Horse S**t?
","There is nothing in this show that rings true. The dialogue is calculated and cartoonish, the acting forced and borderline community theatre, and the sets are ""Music Man"" clean. People don't now, nor ever did talk like these characters. And the streets of New York were never this clean.",/review/rw7799748/?ref_=tt_urv
