29 April 2021,eddie_baggins,7," A gritty old-school crime thriller with a killer Statham performance
","Sticking to the lower budget roots that got him a start in a big way thanks to Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, Guy Ritchie has followed up his minor but well-received The Gentleman with Wrath of Man, a crime thriller that sees the divisive but entertaining director get his favorite lad Jason Statham back on leading man duties.",/review/rw6882190/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2021,deloudelouvain,6," For a Guy Ritchie movie disappointing, for a Statham movie like usual.
","Guy Ritchie is after Quentin Tarantino and The Coen Brothers one of my favorite directors. With sublime movies like Snatch, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and The Gentlemen, he's one of those directors you follow and are curious and excited about when a new movie comes out. But not all his movies are of the same quality. Like Sherlock Holmes for example (which I found mediocre) Wrath of Man is just passable. It's all well directed but the quality is just not there. And it's a movie with Jason Statham, so it speaks for itself what you will get. Statham never laughs, Statham can't be beaten, Statham wants revenge, in short Statham plays the same character every time. A bit like Liam Neeson. I don't say those are bad actors, certainly not, but it's just always the same. Wrath of Man is full of mindless action, a lot of dead people, a lot of questionable scenes (like the heist for example that looked like doomed to fail). I watched the movie trying not to yawn, I was hoping to get those great dialogues Guy Ritchie is known for, but that just never happened. Wrath of Man is just okay to watch once, but that's it, certainly not at the same level as the other movies from Guy Ritchie.",/review/rw6882190/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2021,Krush_Burner,7," Intense and grim heist movie
","This is definitely not your average Guy Ritchie film. It is not light-hearted, albeit there is some slick dialogues. It has no comic appeal, albeit there is a bit of dry humor. Think of shortened edition of Michel Mann's ""Heat"" rather than ""Snatch"" or ""Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels"", and you'll got some understanding of what it's all about.",/review/rw6882190/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2021,morfindele,9," No frustration
",I am surprised of some reviews that are saying about frustration from this movie. What did you expect from the Ritchie's film with Statham in 2021? Sophisticated drama with Oscar winning plot?,/review/rw6882190/?ref_=tt_urv

27 May 2021,SnoopyStyle,7," Ritchie does another crime thriller
","In L. A., an armored truck is robbed and the two drivers are killed. Patrick Hill (Jason Statham) barely passes the tests to be the new hire at the company. When his truck gets hit, he turns into the Terminator.",/review/rw6882190/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2021,Tweekums,8," Guy Richie and Jason Statham team up again for a solid crime thriller
","This film from director Guy Richie opens with an armoured truck carrying a significant amount of cash being ambushed in Los Angeles. By the time the attack is over the guards and one bystander are dead and the crooks have vanished with the money. Five months later Patrick 'H' Hill applies for a job at the armoured truck company; he just passes the entrance test and is hired. Soon afterwards a truck he is aboard is attacked. Instead of just handing over the money he fights back, shooting the attackers with military precision. It is obvious that Hill is more than the average person he initially appeared to be. Without giving any details; he is a man on a mission and he is going to end up head to head with his target when a team of thieves plan a robbery that could net then over one hundred and fifty million dollars!",/review/rw6882190/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2021,MadamWarden,4," MEDIOCRITY OF GUY
","I went, not expecting much of this movie given what I saw in the trailer, but I was at least expecting some punchy one liners and a solid plot given it is Guy Ritchie, one of my faves. How disappointing to see neither. Boring, mundane script and a relentlessly stupid plot with so many holes, you could drive an armoured car through it blindfolded! E.g. Unmapped network of tunnels in LA, $160 million that fits into a few duffel bags, only 2 ATVs for 7 criminals and said millions. OMFG. What dross!",/review/rw6882190/?ref_=tt_urv

21 July 2021,kosmasp,9," Path(s) of Man
","Jason Statham and Guy Ritchie ... some might call them a dream team. And while Jason has the looks and drive to feel like an action ""hero"" of the past - he also has quite the talent to be above that cliche. We know him and even at the beginning of this, when no one of the other characters seem to know what they are dealing with - the audience knows there is more to the man, than we are shown.",/review/rw6882190/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2021,aaronclawrence,5," Well made, but actually kinda boring
","This is not your traditional Guy Ritchie movie with slick fast paced action, clever humour and lots of twists. Which I have loved in the past. It is basically a combination of heist movie and revenge thriller. But it's played very straight, without a lot of effort to build characters, and doesn't ever seem to build much momentum. So a few times during the movie I found myself looking at my watch, wondering if it was really going anywhere.",/review/rw6882190/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2021,questl-18592,4," Wrath of Critic
","I bet there's a good movie buried in this thing, I just don't think Guy Ritchie can unearth it. From the jump, the acting felt amateurish, the dialogue clunky and forced. Statham is solid but that's not really saying much because he's basically just playing his usual tough guy badass role, which normally I'm in for but he's lost in the shuffle of this movie. The whole second act is a muddled jumble of time jumps. 3 years ago, 5 years ago, 8 months ago, a week ago. Whatever it actually was it felt like in the course of 20 minutes I experienced 5 timelines and I was getting whiplash being yanked around so much.",/review/rw6882190/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2021,neener3707,7," Another Gritty Worthwhile Crime Flick From Guy Ritchie
","I love Guy Ritchie films, I saw this on a whim and didn't know it was him until the opening credits. So when I saw that I knew I was in for a white knuckle action fueled ride that I would love. And while its obviously not his best, by a long shot actually, I liked it, I enjoyed it, and I recommended it to friends and family. But a masterpiece it was not.",/review/rw6882190/?ref_=tt_urv

19 July 2021,ztigr,8," Great cast. Understand that JS character is not a hero.
","A lot is giving away in the trailers for this movie that spoil surprises. I am a big Jeffrey Donovan fan and this is the best performance I've seen Scott Eastwood have. Josh Hartnett is underutilized unfortunately. The back and forth timeline helps improve kind of an ordinary thriller. Please remember when watching this story that Jason Statham's character is not a hero. He's not even an antihero. He is just as bad or worse than the ""bad guys"". I have seen people online ask questions such as ""why didn't he...."" And the answer is simple, he is not a good guy so he was not motivated to help others. The title says it al...",/review/rw6882190/?ref_=tt_urv

","Jason Statham get a job with an armored car company in Los Angeles. After extensive testing and training, he is assigned to work with Holt McCallany. Despite barely passing the tests, when a hold up is tried, Statham kills all six bad guys singlehandedly.

12 May 2021,crmorgan6,7," Fun action movie without the politics
","Glad to see a movie that isn't constantly rubbing some sort of political garbage in your face every two minutes! This movie proves you can successfully have a diverse cast that doesn't seem forced. The dialogue is a little contrived at times, which took me out of it, but for a couple hours of shoot em up fun with a semi-clever story (and Statham is pretty bad ass) it's worth the price of admission.",/review/rw6882190/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2021,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," Not as Stathamish as I would've liked it.
","Not one of Guy Ritchie's best films either, and the timelines created more convolution than intrigue. But if you're a Statham fan, and love action, revenge, bloodshed and carnage - like me, then you need to watch this. It's an 8/10 from me.",/review/rw6882190/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2021,Leofwine_draca,8," Ritchie's best in 20 years
","I liked this one quite a bit despite the obvious flaws. It turns out to be a remake of a French thriller and I can say, hand on heart, that it's Guy Ritchie's best movie since SNATCH. Jason Statham is at his taciturn best as a stone-faced hero who takes a job at a security firm driving armoured vehicles full of cash. Shades of MONEY MOVERS here, the Aussie classic of the 1970s, and very nearly as good, although the middle section gets bogged down with too many layered flashbacks which reduce the momentum. The good news is that it picks up for a fantastic extended action climax which is the best I've seen from Hollywood in a while.",/review/rw6882190/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2021,Pjtaylor-96-138044,5," A moody man in a moody movie.
","Guy Ritchie's latest, a remake of 'Cash Truck (2004)', focuses on a mysterious armoured vehicle driver who displays lethal proficiency whenever a truck he's in is targeted by armed robbers. The plot plays out in chapters, moving back and forth throughout time to reveal different layers to the characters and situation. It's a decent idea but it's executed a little poorly; Statham, the man we all came to see, sort of disappears for a large chunk of the 'Wrath Of Man (2021)', despite retaining protagonist status. Having said that, the flick does get better as it goes along and its weakest aspect is definitely its first, seemingly most straightforward segment. That's because it's basically just a bunch of guys making crude homophobic and sexist remarks as they go about their day job. Sure, there are one or two decent action sequences, but even these don't make up for just how monotonous it all is. It doesn't help that Statham is just playing a moody man in a moody movie, without a hint of the sort of self-awareness that makes his overly 'macho' aura work in other productions. It really is just a bit boring, and its perpetuation of the type of toxic masculinity that went out of fashion years ago (which continues throughout its run-time) actually makes it feel old-fashioned in the worst possible way. When its narrative starts to get a bit more involved, it does become a bit more engaging. It tries to develop its side characters enough so that you care when some of them inevitably die, which is appreciated even if it doesn't quite work. The action in the latter half of the picture is more compelling than that in its first and the filmmaking, in general, is on point throughout. Sadly, its revenge element doesn't have the impact it should because the person getting revenge hasn't been developed as a character for quite some time (so, even though he's physically there during the finale, he lacks any semblance of presence). That's the problem with the whole affair, really: it lacks impact. Even at its best, it's just the sort of thing that unfolds in front of you and immediately slips from your mind. It's a self-serious slog for much of its run-time. Even though it has its more successful moments, I wouldn't really recommend it. 5/10.",/review/rw6882190/?ref_=tt_urv

5 May 2021,The-Sarkologist,9," Another Ritchie Gem
","I've always liked a Guy Ritchie film, and this one certainly doesn't disappoint. In fact it seems as if he gets more traction if he makes a film that isn't necessarily based on well known characters (considering that King Arthur really didn't go down all that well), though even if he does make a film that flops, he always manages to pick himself up again and make something different. In fact, he seems to be able to survives flops that would be career ending for some directors.",/review/rw6882190/?ref_=tt_urv
