1 February 2020,ankitak-64340,10," I'll miss this show
","After watching the last two final episodes of this series I've changed my rating from 8 to 10. Why? Because I loved the last two episodes - the simple and sweet ending they gave to this awesome show, with no twists whatsoever.",/review/rw5460355/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2020,ahmedgorshy,10," the good place is when a tv show is changing the world for the better
","The good place is when a tv show is changing the world for the better.
There are no longer a lot of this type of program on television, and this is a rational thing in the public domain, but an act that has become a bad place, or this is what I thought before I watched so good place.
When I watch The Good Place, I do not watch it as an entertainment series. I am changing my life for the better, and the series has already succeeded in doing that. Thank you, The Good Place.
Note The series contains the most relaxing nerve ending you will watch so don't forbid yourself to watch it",/review/rw5460355/?ref_=tt_urv

",And now it's over but I won't forget it. There is nothing more I can say beyond what has been said. This show was unique and wonderful. I loved it. I loved it so very much. I will miss it. Thank you Michael Schur and everyone involved - you did a good thing.,/review/rw5460355/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2020,buke95,10," After Finale- Please Give This Show Whatever Award There Is
","Perfect. Just perfect. I appreciate that the series ended at the right time, and I can feel that it served its exact purpose. The whole cast/crew deserves a standing ovation. Every detail of this series is so meaningful, funny, sad, smart, emotional, all at the same time.",/review/rw5460355/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2020,Dracyan_TheRealOne,10," Take it sleazy
","I know true perfection doesn't really exist and that every show has it's flaws, but with The Good Place I just can't think of what they would be.",/review/rw5460355/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2016,Narce,8," A Good Place for a Good Show
","First off, I have loved Kristen Bell's work ever since the late, lamented Veronica Mars series. Like Buffy, she is the perky blonde who saves the world. And perhaps in this series, she will have to do the same - literally! The whole ""look and feel"" reminds me very much of Pushing Daisies - the saturated colours, the segues into absurdity, even the life-after-death motifs. And that's not a bad thing - Daisies was one of my top favourite shows.",/review/rw5460355/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2016,hfreexx,8," A feel good show with a stronger message underneath
","I love this show. It's a feel good comedy that's lighthearted and will make you laugh while still trying to get some good life lessons across. You also don't need to search to find the deeper meaning in the show, its made blatantly obvious, but its not heavy. ",/review/rw5460355/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2016,jakew500,9," Imaginative and Fun
","Honestly, this show is fun. That's the bottom line for it. I have watched the first eight episodes so far, and it's not the funniest or most clever TV I have every watched, but it was fun to view. It's bright, has fun set pieces, and the characters are all great. Kristen Bell and Ted Danson both play their parts beautifully, and are a pleasure to watch perform. One of the most fun aspects of the show is slowly having the rules of ""The Good Place"" revealed to you as you watch. I hope this show isn't cancelled, because I would be sorely disappointed if I didn't get to keep learning how this world operates. If you haven't yet tried out ""The Good Place"" it is well worth a shot.",/review/rw5460355/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2016,Dr_Sagan,," Original, funny enough, and maybe with a hidden message...
","Just watched the double-episode pilot of ""The Good Place"" and I would say it's a ""Good Comedy"".",/review/rw5460355/?ref_=tt_urv

",The final season proved that this show really is a beautiful one (and one of the best shows ever on TV).,/review/rw5460355/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2016,doubtitall,8," An excellent new comedy
","I almost didn't watch The Good Place, but I was pleasantly surprised. It is well done and very entertaining. The writers have done a nice job of designing a biting satire on thinking about the afterlife without attacking any real religion in particular.",/review/rw5460355/?ref_=tt_urv

","Two moths ago I lost my wife.So many Grief I had ,So many tears.
This show told me maybe she is in the good place now.
After many years I will find her in the good place.
Thank you. All the cast of the show.
Thank you! The creator of the show.",/review/rw5460355/?ref_=tt_urv

24 October 2016,roughacresrlmckee,9," Entertaining enough to drag me into binge-watching
","I thought this would be boring, but watched the pilot... then the second episode... then the third... fourth... fifth... sixth... seventh... and came full-stop only because those are the only episodes I could watch now On Demand.",/review/rw5460355/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2017,windsoflight,10," Plot Twists Abound!
","I only started watching it for Kristen Bell, but it quickly became my favorite TV show. I couldn't spoil this even if I wanted to. You really have to watch it for yourself. Every episode left me going, ""Wait, what?! How can you stop it there??"" and the final episode of the season literally made me scream ""WHAT THE FORK?!"" Ignore the reviews of anyone who hasn't seen every episode yet. Trust me when I say, you have no idea what you're watching until that last episode. Then, you'll likely have to re-watch it (like I am right now) to see it in a whole new light.",/review/rw5460355/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2020,geraldjaupi,10," Virtuously Sleazy!

21 November 2016,planktonrules,9," So far...so good.
","I am writing this review after having seen the first 9 episodes of ""The Good Place"" and the show is now on hiatus---awaiting more episodes in January. So far, I have enjoyed it quite a bit and my review is only based on the show thus far...it might continue to be excellent or it could degenerate to crap (look at seasons two and three of ""Heroes"" and you'll understand what I mean).",/review/rw5460355/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Picture a wave. In the ocean. You can see it, measure it, its height, the way the sunlight refracts when it passes through. And it's there. And you can see it, you know what it is. It's a wave.
And then it crashes in the shore and it's gone. But the water is still there. The wave was just a different way for the water to be, for a little while. You know it's one conception of death for Buddhists: the wave returns to the ocean, where it came from and where it's supposed to be."" -Chidi",/review/rw5460355/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2019,jennjall,10," Great Show - Philosophy Grad Student Approved üëçüèª
","This show is not only clever, creative, and funny but it tackles philosophical dilemmas in a hysterical way, especially The Trolley Problem episode. As a philosophy grad student, this brings pure joy to my heart. This show works through issues from some great philosophers (accurately, if it I might add) while having fun and making fun of how us humans really can't help but fork things up sometimes.",/review/rw5460355/?ref_=tt_urv

",there are not but few shows now days that have it all the humor the family friendlness the good characters but this oh this is one of this oh this is one of those shows i laughed nonstop heavenly comedy really i liked mr danson as God and elinore proves anyone can in fact turn their life around if they bare given the chance to succeed in life its very beleiveable as well u cant really help but love this show its sweet a good lesson nothing is really wrong at all here just mabey slightly on the corny side sometimes but still well worth a watch good fall family comedy with a heart and a good message u gotta watch to see just how good of a place it truly is,/review/rw5460355/?ref_=tt_urv
