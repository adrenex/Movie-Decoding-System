9 December 2014,bowmanblue,7," Fun... mostly
","If you're thinking of watching 'The Expendables 3,' then 'part 3' is a kind of odd place to start any franchise. Therefore, I would generally recommend starting with part 1 and going from there. However, in case you're in any wonder as to what it's all about, it's basically an ensemble cast (led by Sly Stallone) of all the biggest (and best?) action stars of the eighties (plus Jason Statham thrown in for good measure).",/review/rw3075441/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2014,namashi_1,7," Good Fun! And Mel Gibson is Great as a baddie!
","'The Expendables 3' is an entertaining 3rd part in the series, which had an amazingly impressive sequel. This action extravaganza which completes the trilogy, is indeed Good Fun! And its such a pleasure to watch Hollywood Legend Mel Gibson stealing the show, by enacting the baddie to perfection! ",/review/rw3075441/?ref_=tt_urv

30 August 2014,chaos-rampant,," Mind-numbingly tired
","The second was mildly enjoyable, the third time it's tired, the attraction has lost any charm and they still haven't figured out a way to create a sense of world. Terminator, Lethal Weapon, all these films created their own world. Even Cobra had a home to come back to, that marvelous Venice beach apartment next to the Pepsi logo where he forked pizza with a knife. ",/review/rw3075441/?ref_=tt_urv

17 August 2014,ferguson-6,5," The Knife Before Christmas
","Greetings again from the darkness. Whether you saw the first two in this series will directly correlate to whether you head to the theatre for this third entry. The filmmakers' attempt to attract a younger audience by adding a ""new"" crew and dropping to a PG-13 rating backfires, and will not provide the legs this franchise needed for more installments.",/review/rw3075441/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2014,anghart,3," Seems the audience is Expendable
","When the first Expendables was announced, it was supposed to be a throwback to the early years of action cinema - gratuitous violence, one liners and major carnage. The first two films lived up to this. The third is just awful.",/review/rw3075441/?ref_=tt_urv

","The first one was interesting seeing old big names on screen. The second one had the Chuck Norris jokes and van Damme doing his signature kicks. This one?... This one has a lot of ""kaboom and badawoom""... Which is why, I guess, it is an all right movie.",/review/rw3075441/?ref_=tt_urv

","Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and The Expendables rescue Doc (Wesley Snipes), who has been imprisoned for eight years, from a train that is transporting him to a maximum security prison. Doc joins Barney, Lee Christmas (Jason Statham ), Gunner (Dolph Lundgren), Toll Road (Randy Couture) and Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) in the assignment of stopping the dealer Victor Mins during a transaction of bombs. However they discover that the dealer is actually the former Expendable Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson) that shots Hale Caesar badly. The Expendables take their friend to the hospital and Barney meets Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger) in the waiting room that tells that they are old. ",/review/rw3075441/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2014,Seraphion,7," Nice to see so many stars on one frame
","After the last movie, Barney goes on freeing one of his old team members, Doc. And on their next assignment there's a surprise, the target of the op turns out to be Stonebanks, Barney's presumed dead old teammate, who is still alive and now is a big shot arms dealer. Stonebanks get a clean shot at Barney but instead shot Caesar to get to Barney's mind. Stonebans' trick worked, Barney feels that he's not into losing anyone else close anymore, and decides to break up the team that's been with him since the first movie. He then contacts Bonaparte, and together they recruit young guns to make a new team. With the new team, they take on Stonebanks again and succeeded. But Stonebanks apparently has a tracker with him and the team gets ambushed on a bridge. Barney was tossed into the river while the youngsters are captured. Barney then sets up to go alone for the rescue, having only Galgo, the talkative operative formerly denied entry to the team by Bonaparte, to go with him.",/review/rw3075441/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2014,hawkfrend-875-968087,8," Great popcorn flick
","I read a lot of bad reviews about this film, attacks on the script, plot and direction, so I was pleasantly surprised to find they were all wrong and they totally missed the point. I think these people were expecting Oscar winning performances but this film is about watching bad guys getting their a*s kicked. I also read that the actors seems withdrawn and bored of their roles and that is utter rubbish, and even if that were true it doesn't matter, im not interested in deep characters and meaningful performances in films like this, I just want to see lots of destruction and the bad guys getting owned.",/review/rw3075441/?ref_=tt_urv

","Aging mercenaries portrayed by aging action stars team with younger mercenaries to battle an international arms dealer (Mel Gibson) in a poorly written, badly shot and cut, muddled mess of an action film - the third entry in the series/franchise/action hero seniors tour begun by Sylvester Stallone (already having milked his Rocky & Rambo franchises for remaining crumbs) in 2010 with a decent first entry.",/review/rw3075441/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2014,siderite,8," Best one yet

15 August 2014,enquiries-81-121224,9," Just watch it
","You know what. With a busy lifestyle and so much to do everyday, every now and then you just need to watch an action movie that you do not need to think too much about, that simply washes over you and puts a nostalgic smile on your face.",/review/rw3075441/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2014,Meven_Stoffat,2," The Expendables trilogy now has its Godfather III
","First off, nobody expects a film like The Expendables to be amazing. Even the cast and writers are aware of it, which is why the first two movies in the series succeeded. They were merely an excuse for our favourite childhood action stars to blast people's brains apart and utter cringe-worthy one-liners, and sold themselves as such, and that's why the series worked in the first place. The series was pure trash and it embraced it, and so did we. I mean, how can anyone expect a film with a scene where Chuck Norris makes a Chuck Norris joke to be anything deep? If we want Shakespeare, we'll watch Shakespeare, simple as that. And so it leads you to wonder exactly how on earth The Expendables 3 ended up the way it did. The first red flags were raised when it was announced earlier this year that the film would be rated PG-13, and that was just the start",/review/rw3075441/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," I enjoyed this movie
","After the mediocre first and insultingly stupid second part this one finally delivers what the series always set out to do: elderly action stars in ironic, fun action scenes. The humor works much better here and doesn't feel as forced as before and the new additions are great. Especially Gibson obviously had fun with his villain role. Sure, this still isn't one of the smartest films ever made and it certainly wouldnt have needed the young additions. But at least the film is fun and thoroughly entertaining, unlike the stupid second part.",/review/rw3075441/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2014,EdWrite,8," Never mind the quality feel the width
","If you are looking for intellectual enlightenment please stop reading. The Expendables 3 is not for the cerebral it is full of blazing action scenes, comfortable humour and a plot that is held together by duck tape but it delivers in spades. OK Harrison Ford is his usual gray self but Antonio Banderas shines in every scene he is in mixing pathos and humor in a heady mix of, ""why has he not been the lead in anything more than the cat in Shrek"", for so long. Also Wesley Snipes has his moment in the sun as a quipping killer whose knife prowess and capability makes Stratham's character step up to the plate.",/review/rw3075441/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2014,tmf084,8," Really decent action flick
","Don't expect too much and take it for what it is - a high profile summer action flick that's out there to bring you some light entertainment and a bit of nostalgia. The story is simple and filled with tropes but makes sense to a degree where you can buy it and focus on the action sequences and one liners, which are pretty funny. I especially liked that they went for classic action sequences, still with lots of explosions and fight scenes but keeping it tidy enough to not overload the audience - unlike other movies where action scenes start to become just flickering images because they put so much in them and so many dynamic camera movements that you almost start to feel nauseous.

25 August 2014,PWNYCNY,1," Perhaps the worst major motion picture produced in the 21st century.
","For those who enjoy wasting their money and time watching bad movies, this movie will be a joy. But for those who value artistic excellence and high quality entertainment, you are now warned: stay away! This movie is a cinematic disaster. One could attribute this tepid result to poor acting, but that would be charitable because there is no acting. The acting isn't even cheesy; it is non-existent. Except for Mel Gibson, every member of the cast is merely reciting lines. Some of the so-called performances are downright shocking in their shallowness. Perhaps the most egregious example is that of Antonio Banderas. His clownish performance in this movie has to be the nadir of his career. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a shadow of his former self. It could also be said that the movie lacks a compelling story. That too would be giving the movie too much credit. What is supposed to pass for a story is so unoriginal and so lacking in depth as to render it superfluous. The actors recite lines, but the lines do not form a story. No character is ever developed enough to warrant empathy or any other audience reaction. If only the cast were playing caricatures of their former roles, then maybe that would have generated some excitement or at least laughs. But sadly, they're not even caricatures. The movie does include several scenes with unintended humor, but this movie is not a spoof. It is a serious attempt to present an action and adventure motion picture, and the attempt fails. If this movie was played for laughs, then maybe there would be something positive to write about, but that would have required that the cast actually be comical and act and not just show up. There's no point in assigning blame for such a poorly produced production; it does not matter. Over-the-hill action actors may have a place in cinema, but this movie is not their venue. Give them a good story, solid direction, and interesting lines and maybe the result would be satisfactory. It happened with the Wild Bunch (1969); there's no reason why it can't happen again.",/review/rw3075441/?ref_=tt_urv
