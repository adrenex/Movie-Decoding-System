24 January 2016,ivo-cobra8,10," Adrenaline Rush - Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift is a solid good third entry action flick!
","The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) in my opinion I think is a solid good action sequel, a very bashed and hated in the series. Which I don't think this movie is bad, I think is a much better movie than Furious 7. I always loved this movie, I think it is a good movie, but in the series is not the worst one, but is far from worst one that would be Furious 7. I think it was a different solid, good sequel in the series and I love it for an action film. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a fun movie to watch: it accomplishes what it set out to do and that's provide the most realistic yet gravity-defying racing sequences, backed with the eye-catching background of the electrifying, neon Tokyo. Plot-wise it suffers a bit and the acting isn't top-notch, otherwise the loud music, import cars, cityscape Tokyo, and Japanese pop culture more than make up for the flaws of the film that you'll watch it again and again.",/review/rw1392816/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2017,CinemaCocoa,8," No rats in buckets, no CGI, just an entertaining flick featuring excellent car racing
","Branching away from any original cast members of the first two films, thankfully, Tokyo Drift provides a refreshingly new look to the franchise.",/review/rw1392816/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2014,zardoz-13,8," ""Tokyo Drift"" Charts A Change of Pace
","""Better Luck Tomorrow"" director Justin Lin's ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" qualifies as a departure from the norm for a franchise. First, the action takes place in Asia instead of Los Angeles. Second, until the ending, we don't see anybody familiar. Although the hero is a misunderstood misfit, he isn't anything like the major characters in the previous films. Lucas Black plays a high school kid who is attracted to trouble, but he isn't a professional thief or a public servant. As Sean Boswell, he winds up in Tokyo and has to prove himself in an entirely different culture. Inevitably, our hero clashes with the nephew of a Yakuza boss played by the legendary martial arts superstar Sonny Chiba. Lin does a terrific job orchestrating some complicated action, especially the scenes where drivers drift. The drifting here, particularly during a town race, is breathtaking stuff. On the basis of its stunt driving, """"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" ranks as a good movie. Of course, the Chris Morgan screenplay is shallow, but he fills the action with interesting characters. Lucas Black is terrific as the fish-out-of-water hero. Brian Tee makes a first-class villain as TK, while Sung Kang is appropriately laid-back and cool as a glacier. Superior stunts, adrenalin-laced races, and a sympathetic protagonist make this ""Fast and Furious"" installment a breath of fresh air.",/review/rw1392816/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2015,Tweekums,7," A new cast in a new city
","This film may be part of the 'Fast and the Furious' series but, apart from a brief cameo, it features an entirely different cast. Instead of being centred on undercover cop Brian O'Conner it follows teenager Sean Boswell who is sent to live with his father in Tokyo after destroying his car in a street race. His father forbids him from having anything to do with cars but it isn't long before a classmate introduces him to the local 'drift racing' scene. Here he has a run in with DK, the best racer and nephew of a local Yakuza, who isn't happy about Sean talking to his girlfriend. Sean challenges him to a race and DK's friend Han Seoul-Oh lends him a carÂ… which he promptly destroys; if he is going to race he will have to learn how to drift. Han teaches him how to drift while Sean works for him to earn the money to pay for the wrecked car. It isn't long before DK and Han's friendship ends when it becomes apparent that Han has been skimming money. This ultimately puts Sean in his sights; Tokyo isn't big enough for the both of them; a drift race down a treacherous mountain road will determine who stays.",/review/rw1392816/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2006,pauloshdias,8," Refreshing and innovating
","""The Fast And The Furious"" series opened the cinema for a whole new way to make car movies. This 3rd movie from this series added the cherry on the top of a sweet cake. Lots of action during the whole movie and, I must say, a very good argument. Way better than the 2nd movie with some characters very well created and also their evolution through out the movie.",/review/rw1392816/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2013,Bruce722,8," Really good film.
","The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is the least popular of the Fast and Furious franchise but it's also the most underrated. While I thought the country accent was a little overblown and some of the cgi looked a little too obvious, the movie was really good. The plot is fresh and exciting, the acting is spot on, and the cars are great. That's honestly one of my only gripes with 2 Fast 2 Furious is that, while really entertaining, it got away from the car element quite a bit. This movie brought back the cool car factor that made the first film so special. Overall, while it wasn't as good as the first two, it was still a great movie in its own right and one that can stand alone without the others.",/review/rw1392816/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2020,rajjindal-72925,10," UNDERRATED Movie ! Totally
",This is the only movie about cars racing and after this they are only fighting between each other . Why this movie do not earn more at box office i don't understand. But for me this movie is best in franchise after fast five.,/review/rw1392816/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2013,tmm_8705,7," For the most part a good car action flick.
","The first film was BREAK POINT with cars. The second one was Miami VICE with cars. This is REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE... with more cars. To be honest, I kinda liked this one better than the last two, despite Lucas Black somehow beating Paul Walker as the least charismatic actor in a starring role. What I mainly like is the direction by Justin Lin. The focus on police undercover stories is dropped in favor of the street racing culture and its connections to the mob. Was actually delighted to see Sonny Chiba appear, I must have missed his name during the opening credits. Purely as a movie about car action, I think it succeeds better than the first two. There's a goofy quality to it that kinda helps one go along with things. Best to sum that up is Lucas Black smiling like a dork with blood on his teeth, living for the thrill. That's probably what this film series needed, and less soap opera/undercover drama. Consider me surprised.",/review/rw1392816/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2021,patches89,8," MOST UNDERRATED OF THE SERIES!!
","I absolutely love this film, it moves over to Tokyo where instead its just pure speed we get the taste of the drift makes it kind of Need for Speedish. The protagonist is quite forgettable but we are introduced to Han and the best racing to date.",/review/rw1392816/?ref_=tt_urv

8 April 2008,ma-cortes,6," The drivers, the cars and the Drift races are the real stars of this movie , well directed on Tokyo location
","This is an exciting narration of drifting auto racing with exceptionally fine camera work and great car chase sequences and crashes on the metropolitan streets. It deals about a rebel American adolescent named Shawn Boswell(Lucas Black as a determined race-car driver) challenges his contender for a race cars, causing wreak havoc racing 195 mph through streets. To avoid the jail, his mother(Lynda Boyd) sends him Tokyo where is his father(Brian Goodman) as US military. Meanwhile the newcomer Shawn tries to ingratiate with Twinkie(Nathalie Kelley) and the world of racing in Japan, and hoping to join his extended group. In Tokio he discovers the underworld of the Yazuka and competes against Drift kingpin who is niece of mobster chief(Sonny Chiba who does a credible job).",/review/rw1392816/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2006,accidentalist,7," Surprisingly good - Sung Kang steals the show
","I'm getting the feeling that the majority of reviews here as of June 14th are bogus. Why write a review if you've only seen the trailer for the film? Anyway, I had the opportunity to see this movie yesterday. Yeah, this is the one of those film series people will hate before seeing. It's over the top, has cheesy dialogue, and has an unlikeable protagonist. With that said, it's actually pretty entertaining, and isn't all that bad.",/review/rw1392816/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2006,andrew-limtiaco,8," Not a bad film considering it was a Part 3
","Usually when a film has a Part III, it leaves you with, ""Why did they make a third film?"" Case in point, ""Smokey & The Bandit"". Now I am dating myself if that's the only film I can come up with when it comes to trilogies. But car movies are seldomly done in trilogies. Star Wars, The Godfather, Lord of the Rings and Back to the Future are the only exceptions that have worked in the past because there's an on-going story line.",/review/rw1392816/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2006,andykhiem87,7," Decent, Hardly any substance, But Sometime to watch :D
","What can I say about this movie that many haven't already noted? Well first of all I saw this movie twice, and probably shouldn't have. The cinematography was phenomenal and the racing sequences were jaw dropping. Unfortunately, this movie lacks substance. The storyline was really iffy and probably not likely to happen and the acting was a little shaky.",/review/rw1392816/?ref_=tt_urv

28 March 2021,sarnieken,7," The last one about actual racing?
","Look behind the woeful accent and this is actually a good movie. The first F&F was about racing, then went all Miami Vice. A final return to the street racing scene had to move away from the original cast as they had lost their 'From the streets' appeal.",/review/rw1392816/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2006,DaRick89,5," The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is far better than I expected - but I had low expectations. Enjoyable but not critically appealing
","I was quite surprised by The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift. Of course, I expected it to be a pile of steaming garbage, particularly with the formula of increasingly dodgy sequels. So when I went to see it with some friends, I had obvious misgivings. These misgivings, or at least the worst ones, such as the movie being unbearable to even look at, were fortunately unfounded. I kept my eyes on the movie the whole time, mainly because of the souped cars, but the fact that I went through the movie without flinching (a lot, except at some of the bad dialogue that was prevalent), says quite a lot. Maybe my view of The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift is heightened by the fact that I cracked a few jokes during the movie.",/review/rw1392816/?ref_=tt_urv

18 August 2007,DVD_Connoisseur,," Glossy, exciting bubblegum for the eyes and brain
","The third installment in ""The Fast and the Furious"" series is possibly the best so far and was a pleasant surprise. I went into this film with low expectations but was genuinely thrilled by the film. As a devoted petrol-head, it doesn't take too much to start my heart pounding and the sight of the automotive pornography portrayed here certainly did the trick.",/review/rw1392816/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2006,CuriosityKilledShawn,1," Utterly worthless waste of time and money
","TFATF is THE most pointless and artistically redundant franchise in history! The first, which was a total piece of crap, gave way to a tepid, moronic sequel and now, after three years of peace and quiet we are punished with Tokyo Drift. The most American Japan you will ever see in a film! Although there is even less of a story than the other two (if that's possible) it is still a carbon copy of its predecessors and offers absolutely nothing new. The characters are crap! The action is lame, soulless, overcut and PG13-friendly and is obviously 'inspired' by hours and hours of endless Playstation.",/review/rw1392816/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2006,LilyDaleLady,1," The Slow and The Stupid: Part III

","When teenage road-racer Sean Boswell (Lucas Black, who is too old for the part, but hey-ho) gets in trouble with the law for a third time, he avoids a jail sentence by going to live with his father in Tokyo; there, he becomes involved in the drift racing scene, coming to blows with DK (Brian Tee), the nephew of a powerful Yakuza.",/review/rw1392816/?ref_=tt_urv
