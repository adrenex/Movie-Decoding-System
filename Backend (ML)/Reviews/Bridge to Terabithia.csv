","'From Dusk Till Dawn' is kind of brilliant, brutal, bloody, Tarantino, horror, silly and funny. It is brilliant, brutal, bloody, horror, silly and funny the way Sam Raimi's 'The Evil Dead'-series is all those things, the twist here is a screenplay written by Quentin Tarantino. This means the first hour is just brutal and bloody, sometimes a little funny, in the 'Pulp Fiction' kind of way.",/review/rw0385417/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2010,hitchcockthelegend,9," Outrageous!
","It was probably the most fun I had at the cinema back in 1996. I absolutely love ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", very much one of those films that you either buy into or you don't. There's no surprise element with the film, you get everything that director Robert Rodriguez and writer Quentin Tarantino said you would get - a hard buttocked road movie that turns into a raging ""B"" horror movie gore fest.",/review/rw0385417/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2001,BaronBl00d,," Not Your Average Mexican Hay-ride
","Although I am not AS lovestruck with this film as many other reviewers are, I did find it an entertaining albeit conscience-churning experience.  From Dusk Till Dawn really is two films in one.  The first part tells the story of the Gecko boys(Not Geico) played by George Clooney and Quentin Tarentino. They are escapees from the law and have killed over a dozen people brutally already by the time the film opens.  For me, this tale of how they kill a gas station guy and finally abduct a preacher and his two children for their RV is the most chilling part of the film.  Clooney plays a guy with little moral conscience well.  Tarentino does a good job too and you can see his wit throughout the script.  I found both men very despicable, so I guess the acting was good.  The film falls into parody/farce, however, once the the whole gang(the two Geckos and the preacher and his daughter and son)reach a strip club/bar out in the middle of nowhere in Mexico.  What happens here, to the uninformed viewer, will be totally unexpected.  Does it work?  To a degree, however, the film really loses momentum and credibility it might have had.  The acting in general is all acceptable.  Harvey Keitel once again shows us why he is such a good actor.  Juliette Lewis is also very good in her role as his daughter.  Nice to see guys like Tom Savini and Fred Williamson too.  Oh, and Salma Hayek IS the highlight of the film.",/review/rw0385417/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2000,Quinoa1984,10," Gore + vampires + Tarantino & Rodriquez= great entertainment
","Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk till Dawn combines vicious violence, Cheech Marin vampires, and some funny humor from the cast into one big collective film.  More than a basic horror movie, it has Rodriquez as a fine director and Quentin Tarantino as a good screenwriter who bring to the screen basic shoot em up fun.  Not all of it is for the people out there, but for thrill seeking teens, it's worth a glance.",/review/rw0385417/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2001,great_sphinx_42,8," Robbers and Preachers and Vampires, oh my!
","Anyone trying to do a 'serious review' of this movie needs to lighten up. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are the Gecko brothers, two bad, bad men on their way to Mexico. Along the way they pick up a preacher played by Harvey Keitel and his two kids. They're supposed to meet a partner at a bar called The Titty Twister, and once they get there madness ensues. From there it takes a turn that many seem to find infuriating but I personally find highly entertaining. It's humming along like a typical Tarantino picture, and then- BOOM. Out of nowhere, it becomes all too clear that these two bad, bad men are not by a longshot the baddest in *this* bar. All of this can- and *will*, given the right attitude on the part of the viewers- read as a loving high-five to 70s zombie flicks, a homage to the campy fun of those movies. The tough guy dialog continues throughout, the gore level is astounding, and we see via Kate- the preacher's daughter, played by Juliette Lewis- that sometimes a p***ed-off virgin with a crossbow can more than hold her own. On top of that, it has a hella-cool biker-bar soundtrack and Salma Hayek in a bikini. What's not to like?",/review/rw0385417/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2006,jluis1984,8," Great action-packed thrill ride!
","Directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are probably the two most recognizable faces of the generation of filmmakers who had their start in the independent scene of the early 90s. Rodriguez had a tremendous success with his western-inspired action movie ""El Mariachi"" while Tarantino reached fame and glory after updating heist movies in ""Reservoir Dogs"". Their friendship lead them to make movies together starting with ""Four Rooms"", but together with make-up masters Kurtzman, Nicotero and Berger the two young directors crafted one of the most original movies of the 90s: ""From Dusk Till Dawn"".",/review/rw0385417/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2003,Son_of_Mansfield,7," If Seth Gecko had taken on those tomatoes, they never would have eaten France.
","George Clooney should have stuck will this kind of role. He did fine in Out of Sight and Ocean's Eleven, but he really dominated this movie with a fury that we may never see again. Almost every line he delivers is memorable and that is not all Tarantino's doing. The rest of the cast is dominated by cool cameos and veteran cult and mainstream names. The exception being Ernest Liu who does a good job of holding his own. No Tarantino film would be complete without a good soundtrack. This one, as with Desperado, features songs by Tito and Tarantula. Although I have only heard four songs by them, I consider them one of my favorites. I will never forget what my parents told me after they watched this without me. ""You sure can pick 'em,"" my mother blurted with distain. Do not make my mistake, watch it with your parents to see them squirm.",/review/rw0385417/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2013,rubenvanbergen,7," Concept: 9, execution: 6
","I sat down to this movie with no preconceptions whatsoever, as had been recommended to me. This turned out to be very good advice, because it makes the twist in the middle a complete surprise, and therefore all the more enjoyable. (It is for this reason that I'm giving a spoiler warning, as even knowing there is a twist might rob people of that experience.) ",/review/rw0385417/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2001,glitzgirl76,," So tacky it's good...
","I have to say that this is actually a good movie although it does lose it's way towards the end. The final 15 minutes I thought were a little crappy. I prefer more realism in my vampires but having said that, I cannot fault Tarantino, his is perfect in the role as the twisted Richard Gecko, and although I don't usually like George Clooney he was surprisingly cool as Seth. There are some funny moments that you have to have a slightly twisted humour to appreciate (which I do!) and as long as you don't take it too seriously, it is an entertaining movie. If you like overacting, lots and lots of blood and Tarantino movies then go see.",/review/rw0385417/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2006,LoneWolfAndCub,7," An action-packed extravaganza!!
","From Dusk Till Dawn is simply a fun movie. Not meant to be taken seriously at all. If you're looking for a movie to sit back and enjoy for brainless entertainment, get this. There is nothing wrong with the acting, the music really good and the special effects are gross (but great).",/review/rw0385417/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2006,ThePedofinderGeneral,6," Half an interesting film
","The first half of this film is like anything you'd expect from Quentin Tarintino and Robert Rodriguez: cool 70's soundtrack, snappy dialogue, really good editing, lots of violence, and a slightly unconvincing role by QT himself. I thought it was disturbing, stylish and pretty good for the first half, and was enjoying it.",/review/rw0385417/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2005,MovieAddict2016,7," Bizarrely entertaining - loud, trashy, vulgar...fun. Not great, though.
","Coming into this I knew it would be action over content - after all it was directed by Robert Rodriguez. The fact that the script was written by Tarantino didn't really mean anything since I had gathered from various sources that this was Tarantino's homage to the ""splatstick"" genre (of Evil Dead, etc.) and as a result the script probably wasn't so hot compared to Pulp Fiction.",/review/rw0385417/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2005,jesuit25,8," Crime/Horror
","I loved this film for many reasons. For one, the switch from a crime thriller to a horror thriller was seamless. I for one had not heard much about this film before I watched it, and I assumed the TV Times were mistaken in called this a gory horror thriller. To me, it was a simple crime thriller, the norm which is expected from Tarantino's pen. However, the switch was such a shock and so fast, that I didn't now what happened I was amazed at this revelation, since there was no word of any horror topics beforehand in the script. It was completely out of the blue, and resulted in a pleasant surprise.",/review/rw0385417/?ref_=tt_urv

19 August 2007,barnabyrudge,6," Outrageous, intentionally trashy comedy-horror-thriller.
","In 1960, Alfred Hitchcock did something unthinkable in the film ""Psycho"". Halfway into the movie he killed off the main character (and the film's biggest star), thereby shocking the audience through sheer unpredictability while simultaneously changing the expected course of the narrative. A similar trick is employed in ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (although the two films are nothing alike). For the first half the film is a kinetic crime thriller, characterised by writer Quentin Tarantino's trademark witty, hard-boiled dialogue and a clutch of well delineated characters. At the halfway point, the film suddenly switches to become an ultra-gory, ultra-violent vampire movie, almost a hyperactive homage to ""Night Of The Living Dead""! It is a jarring switch; the effect is like watching half of two separate movies. There is an element of frustration that the serious crime thriller half never gets properly resolved, and similar frustration that the horror half is not introduced and built-up logically. But both halves are undeniably well-made and the actors seem to be having a great deal of fun with their outrageous roles.",/review/rw0385417/?ref_=tt_urv

28 May 2019,Keemshave,7," Entertaining monster flick.
",A movie that will have you laughing at the sheer absurdity of its scenes. The corny scenes fit the tone of the film as well. Practical effects are better in some scenes than others but overall it works throughout the film. It's a nice change of pace from the first half of the film to the second. A good Halloween monster flick and has a solid Clooney performance.,/review/rw0385417/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2007,pfgpowell-1,1," A pointless and repulsive waste of time
","Just what is the point of this film? It starts off as one film, then changes track, cheating us of a resolution to that film and ends as another movie which is nothing but a pale, pale imitation of so many other schlock-horror flicks you've ever seen. The overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of hubris. Screenplay by Tarantino, direction by Rodriguez, two guys who have previously shown talent, but who now seem to believe their own hype and assume that whatever they do must be good merely because THEY did it. But it doesn't quite work that way. You're only good while you continue doing good things. There are so many questions to ask: Just what are George Clooney and Harvey Keitel doing getting involved in such pointless dreck? Clooney initially makes an intriguing bad guy  utterly ruthless and efficient  and it would have been interesting to see where that was going. But, of course, we never do. And the Clooney of the vampire film changes into a completely different character. That's not clever or witty, that's just bad, bad work. Keitel looks thoroughly ill at ease throughout, and no wonder. Did no one in the studio take a look at the script before this project was given the go-ahead? Tarantino is utterly unpleasant as a murderous sexual deviant (and why did he, as writer, assume we would find the rape, gruesome murder and butchering of an inoffensive hostage funny). On every level  except the technical  this film stinks. Avoid.",/review/rw0385417/?ref_=tt_urv

","From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) is one of my personal favorite vampire films of all time. The best excellent action horror 90's insanlly entertaining movie from director Robert Rodriguez and writter Quentin Tarantino. In my opinion it is their best film, I love this film to death. I am huge fan of this movie.

","There is no reason not to make a film which leaps abruptly from one genre to another. From Dusk Till Dawn leaps from the hard-boiled crime thriller to the gory vampire monster movie at the halfway mark, and does it so blatantly (seamlessly? I think not!!) that you can see the stitch marks.",/review/rw0385417/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2001,bob the moo,," A film of 2 halves - neither very good
","Clooney and Tarantino are brothers on the run from the law.  When they spend the evening in a truckers strip club they find more thrills than they had expected.  This film was trading on several things - the success of Tarantino, Clooney's star power and the hot property of Rodriguez after Desperado.  Unfortunately these are the main things the film has going for it.",/review/rw0385417/?ref_=tt_urv
