18 June 2020,MJDMLQ,5," Should have never rebooted for Season 3
","The first two seasons, with the exception of the last episode of Season 2, were excellent and well acted. When they decided to reboot the series for season 3, there was a serious drop off in show quality. They abandoned a great cliffhanger from season 2, replaced the cast with far inferior actors/actresses, and created a story with characters you really don't care about. Stick to the first two seasons.",/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2020,libbyhatch21-1,7," Seasons 1 & 2
",Really miss the cast & story of the first two seasons. There was so much more story to tell & a lot of unanswered questions. Who killed Kieren? Emma's Dad or Brandon James' brother? What other murders will Noah & Stavros write about? What does the future hold for everyone? I guess the 3rd season is a reboot.,/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2020,www-allie_roo,6," Awesome Season 1&2!!! Why ruin it in season 3??
","Absolutely loved the first two seasons! So I'm am incredibly disappointed they abandoned that storyline, so much was left not to mention many questions unanswered. Didn't give season 3 a chance, finish what you started because that was a fantastic plot with great characters.",/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2021,sammielimehouse-84658,8," First Two Seasons Are Good, Last Season Sucks
","I wish the series ran at least a couple more seasons with the original cast. The cast members of seasons one and two worked so well together and I think they could've told a lot more stories. Honestly, I'd be up for a Scream prequel about what happened in Lakewood before the killings. Nonetheless, they rebooted the entire show in season three and in my opinion, that did not end well. If you ask me there are no redeeming qualities about season three. Basically, I thoroughly enjoyed the first two seasons and was extremely disappointed about the third.",/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2020,danielcereto,8," Great for fans
","I've watched season 1&2 and I can say that there's great quality on the series, mostly concentrated on season 2 by far superior to season 1.
If you love scream movies the series is great for you. It has it's flaws and plot holes but the acting and twists are pretty good. So, overall great two seasons.
Season 3 reboot is pretty bad. Most of new casting is amateurish Afro-Americans. A lot of racial debate on the script, why? Sorry, not for me.",/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2020,alexacaleigh,8," 10star for S01 and S02 but 5star for S03
","What did I just watch??? Season 1 and 2 are awesome! What happened to season 3? Just hope that in season 4 , they will bring back the story and characters in season 1 and 2..
season 3 is lame and just OK.",/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2018,Sleepin_Dragon,8," Plenty of scares to keep you gripped.
","I am so surprised by the quality of this series, I'd intentionally avoided it believing there wouldn't be enough mileage in it, but I'm always glad to be proven wrong, the writing is so good, that yes there is enough mileage in it to keep you gripped and maintain your attention. Initially the crimes seem to come at the expense of characters that you care nothing about, people seem to be introduced just to be bumped off, but as it develops that changes. I understand they couldn't use the original scream mask, but this one looks good enough, works just as well.",/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2020,thevy-prak,5," Season 3 is garbage
","Season 1 and 2 were great and I was looking forward for season 3 to follow the original plot line. But they decided to reboot it and it was awful. From the plot line to the acting, everything was horrible. I wonder how it's possible to get it this wrong. It was completely whack, I can't emphasise it enough!!! The reveal was a complete joke although it could have been interested. The underlying societal problems they hinted at a few times (racism) could have been exploited way better. And also, why is Tyga in it? He was the worst of them all (followed closely by the actress playing Olivia) and his dying scene was almost hilarious.",/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2018,ivo-cobra8,8," A good series that comes to an end season 1 the best season 2 was flawles
","Scream TV Series was a good show that comes to an end. The first Season rocks it is the best in the series. Second season was flawless and was really boring. The Anthology was about Brandon James who was a killer but was caught and who is killing teens now. At the center of those murders was Emma Duval (played by Willa Fitzgerald), a teenage girl who is somehow tied to the town's dark past. I love the mystery in first season and who did it and why. The show is so intense that you are hooked up. Willa Fitzgerald and Carlson Young were a terrific actresses I seriously did enjoy them. John Karna as Noah Foster was also good in the series. The TV series started good as a slasher series. This series was dedicated to Wes Craven who died in 2015. Season 1 and 2 were good. Season 3 is been rebooted which it will suck! 8/10 a good series I have enjoy it.",/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2016,ahmetkozan,7," The murderer will be some less you think...
","Amicably making a case for itself. As a TV series, Scream has the advantage of having infamous namesake and it does deliver the classic slasher gimmick, although its greatest attribute is its self- awareness. It realizes the obstacles, such as clichÃ© high school setting and transition from movie to series, and rather than trying to gloss it over, Scream faces it head-on with smart quips in addition to the mandatory pool of blood.

5 December 2021,owenholder-23178,9," Scream the tv show maybe the most underrated show
",This is if not the most underrated show of all time. I love it. The first two seasons are amazing. I haven't seen season 3 and never will. But damn those first two seasons are some of my favs. I love the characters. I love the vibes. I thought the story was great. And the kills are cool. It's cheesy but in the best way possible. Hopefully the rumors are true and there will be a season 4 with the cast from seasons 1 and 2.,/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2020,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,4," Could have been fun.
","This series just didn't do it for me: beyond the shock value and goriness there's nothing to really keep the viewer invested. It's not psychological horror, it's not really jump-scare horror: it's just soapy horror that doesn't have any real 'bite' to it.",/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2020,Kannaman,8," Noah Foster is the best character, barring Beth.
","I'll admit, I was skeptical. I looked at it for a week and a half before watching it. And when I did watch it I was struggling with how you make a slasher flick into a show. But then, my boy Noah (the best character in the entire series) decided to break the fourth wall in the first episode, and explain exactly what was going to happen and how it would work.",/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2019,rjjackson-17120,2," Here we go again.. Season 3 downhill already..
","A lot of tv shows of this type, appear to be removing good story lines to tick the 'politically correct' boxes. They are now all mingling into the same show.",/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2016,deloudelouvain,5," I guess for teenagers it's okay
","It's obvious that there are a lot of teenagers on IMDb otherwise Scream would never have such high ratings. I did like the movies so I thought I give the series a try but I didn't knew it was on MTV. And it surely shows that it's on MTV. That channel is not what it used to be. They should just stick with music and not series. But I guess for tweeners it's probably okay. But for adults it's most of time cringing to watch. I mean honestly, high school should be kids from around 16 years of age no? Here they look all like they are way in their twenties. Maybe they were that dumb that they had to do their years over and over, like eight times or so. Well at least they act as dumb as teenagers, with a lot of gossip, bullying and romances, and extremely bad music. The typical things teenagers like to watch. I made it until episode five and then I had to give up, couldn't take it anymore. And if you're looking for a lot of thrilling and bloody messes you will be disappointed because there's almost none. So if you are sixteen or less go ahead, but if you're older just skipp this.",/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2019,nadiyaaibrahim,4," It's so lame and kiddish!
","Being a BIG fan of the original Scream movies , this series was a disappointment! No wonder Emma Roberts turned it down. The plot was so predictable , the cast was so gloomy (leaving out Audrey and Noah ,Jake to a certain extent) , Emma - Willa Fitzgerald's character was so lame and omg what are these teenagers ðŸ˜‚
Totally a disgrace to the Scream movies !",/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2015,preppy-3,1," Pretty dismal
","Dreadful TV series based on the ""Scream"" films. It takes the basic premise of the films (kids being stalked by a killer), throws in a new storyline with different characters and uninteresting twists. The show tries to show how clever it thinks it is by referencing old horror films and shoving social media in our face nonstop. The opening killing isn't scary or particularly well-done. It just made me remember how good and scary Drew Barrymore's one from the original was. The actors hired to play the ""kids"" are way obviously too old for high school. They're all good-looking but have zero acting ability. The worst is easily John Karna. His line readings were so awkward I didn't know how to take his character. He's talking about murderers and killings in a VERY annoying casual way. Worst of all the show wasn't interesting or the least bit scary. The nonstop commercials MTV kept inserting didn't help. I won't be tuning in for episode 2.",/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2020,Calicodreamin,6," Mostly good
","The scream series is good for the most part, some awesome slasher action and fairly well developed plot lines. The first season is by far the best, season two a bit boring and sloppy, and season three felt out of place. Overall, good for a few scares and very mindless entertainment, just beware of falling through plot holes.",/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2015,Aktham_Tashtush,7," I really thought this would turn out to be a cheap copy of Scream but on the contrary, it is so thrilling and have more than a bunch of exuberant scenes.
","WoW ,, i really didn't expect it to be that thrilling and full of mysteries,, well it is no where near the movie itself and yes there are some weirdly motionless quiescent moments MTV style like but gosh the craziness and the jumpy scenes are patching up any unnoticeable holes.",/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2015,ZCDomingos,10," What a great surprise!
","I was a little bit worried in the beginning, but with all the videos and stuff they released I actually started liking it, it's different so, if you want to see a copy of Scream Movies, forget it. This is completely different, but in a good way, it's has a good sense of humor, which reminds me the Scream Movies, the mask it works, for me, and actually this show has a story behind, so the killer doesn't kill just for fun. It's funny how they try to ""blame"" some characters, so we can have our own theory.",/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv

7 June 2016,Dannyboi94,7," Very entertaining
","The Scream movie franchise is one of the best horror/mystery movies out there, so when I heard they were making a TV show about it, I instantly dismissed it. MTV shows are known to throw overly attractive actors in your face, and have cheesy dialogue that only teenage girls would like, but they changed that here.",/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2020,darkwizard404,7," The finale of S2 ruined it
",I just finished S2 of this series and I loved it. Both the seasons were fantastic and kept me at the edge of my seat with the twists and thrills. Yes it has quite a few plot holes but they are ignorable. The show managed to have almost the same amount of impact as the movies. Sad that it was discontinued and we were never able to know who Kieran's killer was. The finale of S2 was a disappointment and wasn't needed at all.,/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2019,gabbyh-56791,2," Season 3: disappointing
","After watching season 2 I was excited to continue the storyline with Emma Duval, and I was so upset when I started watching season 3 and they had changed everything, to be honest I didn't even continue watching season 3. It was such a bad idea to scratch the original story. Could have at least published what was going to happen so we weren't left on a cliff hanger!!",/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2017,lorcan-61881,2," Not powerful enough to reach the movies
","Scream is one of my favourite horror film of all time, none of the sequels are even bad so that explains a lot to me even the really tacky third film. Now, when Stranger Things came out, I was off Netflix for four months, due to the antipation for the second season. Anyway, I finally got back on Netflix just about two weeks ago and though I was determined to watch the new show on Netflix, Dark, I decided to give Scream: The TV Series a go considering I love Scream. This show is actually not good, its quite boring just so you's know, it had nothing to actually live up to,but, it did have the same feel to Scream so it was actually quite cool to literally see a 90's horror film like Scream come back, cause they did do that, very well. The acting in this show was quite poor, I liked some actors and actresses like Noah and Audrey and Daisy but thats probably it. Scream: The TV Series is actually quite a bad series to be honest, but its Scream so..its also kind of awesome!",/review/rw4009481/?ref_=tt_urv
