21 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,9," Entertaining!
","I have enjoyed all the Marvel shows so far and Hawkeye is no different. While it's not the best of the Marvel shows, it's not the worst either and is definitely worth watching. It's only six episodes long so you can binge the entire season pretty fast. Jeremy Renner, Hailee Steinfeld and Florence Pugh all do a fantastic job bringing this series to the MCU. With Renner getting into his tragic accident and maybe not being able to walk normal again this may be the last time we see him as Hawkeye. I hope he's able to play the character again but his health is far more important and I hope he gets better quickly. If you're a Marvel fan then give this a try, I think you'll enjoy it as much as I did.",/review/rw7583049/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,9," Solid watch for Marvel fans
",I have to admit I'm a huge fan of the MCU and have enjoyed all the Marvel shows so far so I may be a little biased. I found Hawkeye to be a pretty entertaining show that's been a fantastic addition to Phase 4! I don't get some of these negative reviews though...did you not watch the trailers? Some of you are acting surprised at what you were watching. I don't get it...what were you expecting that you didn't see? If you didn't like this it's because you didn't want to. It's just such a fun ride that you can't turn away because you can't wait to see what happens next. Jeremy Renner is as terrific as always and Hailee Steinfeld and Florence Pugh are both great additions to the MCU. I'm glad to hear that they plan on doing a season every year set around Christmas.,/review/rw7583049/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,kevin_robbins,9," A tremendous action hero series
","Hawkeye (2021) is a series that I recently watched on Disney+. The storyline follows Hawkeye and his life after half the world disappeared due to Thanos. He now needs to balance his family life, build a relationship with his kids and he makes some new friends along the way; oh, and an assassin is on his butt. Can Hawkeye juggle everything while still mourning the loss of his family and friends?",/review/rw7583049/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,CANpatbuck3664,8," Fun Character Dynamics and Great Performances Keep Hawkeye Breezy and Engaging
","You can almost always count on Marvel to deliver some satisfactory action at minimum and while I have a couple of notes, Hawkeye still gets the job done on that front. The action in Hawkeye is a lot of fun if your primary aim isn't to scrutinize everything. Kate and Clint are amazing archers and while their abilities are constantly on display, their great comedic banter also punctuates the action scenes. The choreography is also solid and delivers the requisite punches and kicks. My only complaint (which may or may not seem fair considering) is that things got just a little senseless/cartoonish at the end. I won't argue that those scenes weren't fun but while I was noticing things here and there in the earlier episodes, the finale went past my limit. I know that this might seem petty but minus the opening including the invasion of New York by the Chitauri, Hawkeye was going for something more grounded. Physics need not apply normally with Marvel but I find they do a better job of disguising in most of their releases. On my second viewing of Hawkeye, I couldn't help but notice it more frequently.",/review/rw7583049/?ref_=tt_urv

",This is another Marvel/Disney+ show that I wasn't sure if I was ever going to get around to watching. The reason being that they are long and I don't watch a lot of television. I decided to give it a go in parts when I would feed my newborn daughter.,/review/rw7583049/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2022,solojere,10," A Kate Bishop Christmas
","A year later, and I still love Hawkeye. I remember when it first came out, staying up excited to watch it the second each episode dropped and loving each second. Now rewatching it, the show is still great. For the most part, the MCU tv series haven't been for me (up to this point). They aren't bad just felt dragged out at times. But I love Hawkeye, and I thought it was just as good as the films and even better than a few. The show does Clint Barton (the OG Hawkeye) justice when they could've easily used Kate to make him look dumb. I love that they explored his post-Endgame PTSD and the fact that he is basically the last of the OG Avengers. Also, Hailee Steinfeld is the perfect casting for Kate Bishop. Hailee is one of my favorite actors (she is literally great in everything she does), and this is among her best works as an actor ( she sings too!). She does a great job of portraying Kate Bishop as a complex character who is talented but often too headstrong for her own good. And I love the character development she goes through and that the show allows her to make mistakes and learn from them. Also, Hailee has great chemistry with Jeremy Renner and Florence Pugh. Pizza, the dog, was way too cute. Lastly, Florence Pugh kills it. I would argue that this show does a better job exploring her character than Black Widow did. There are only six episodes, so it is a pretty easy binge-watch. Plus, it's set at Christmas, which is fun. I won't spoil anything, but some people might not like a couple of twists. But I would remind those people that this show is about Clint Barton and Kate Bishop and not about the other characters, who we all know will show up in other MCU shows sooner or later. I would definitely recommend watching it or rewatching it. I can't wait to see Kate Bishop again!",/review/rw7583049/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2022,stevenjlowe82,9," A Christmas MCU delight
",I was so thoroughly impressed by this entry into the ever expanding MCU. Admittedly I've found phase 4 to be a very inconsistent and incoherent jumble and incredibly lackluster. As far as their TV shows go Wandavision is by far my favourite but Hawkeye is a very close second.,/review/rw7583049/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2022,deepfrieddodo,8," Festive Crime-Fighting Fun
","Taking a step away from the grittier Ronin front, Hawkeye brings back a fan favourite character into a family friendly series. This may not be what a lot of people were calling for, but as a kids series, as a Christmas series, it's pretty great.",/review/rw7583049/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2021,briancham1994,3," A whole lot of nothing
","This TV show reminds me of an internet skit in the early 2010s that parodied the then-popular wave of Electronic Dance Music. In the skit, a DJ plays a dance track that builds up, raising the energy and tension. The drumbeats get faster, the synths get louder and more instruments get introduced. The dancers await the track's ""drop"", when the music is supposed to peak in energy and enter a new phase. But instead of reaching a resolution, the track just keeps building up, and up, and up - ad infinitum - to the bafflement of everyone in the room.",/review/rw7583049/?ref_=tt_urv

24 November 2021,sumtim3s00n,5," Rather average, onedimensional and clichee but watchable enough
","Hawkeye by itself might not be at first glance a character to base a show on before so many other choices. However given a large library of comicbook stories, he definitely could be given depth and a good story woven with interesting characters.",/review/rw7583049/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2022,toseale,8," Hallmark Has Nothing on This Perfect Christmas Show
","I found Hawkeye to be plenty of fun as a chase show set during Christmas. Beforehand, I had been wishing he'd get a show, but Jeremy Renner exceeded expectations and proved to me that he really needed a show more than a movie. I loved the dynamic between him and Hailee Steinfeld's Kate Bishop. His character really arched with her help. Another great addition was Alaqua Cox's Echo. I am a little hyped for her show coming soon, and I hope it unravels her story in a good manner. The show's only real backfires are the show's sometimes slow pacing and the hidden ""big bad"". He really didn't do much for me compared to what he could've been, and I hope future installments do him justice if he returns. There is plenty of twists and turns to this show, mixed with some wholesome, action-packed moments that blanket the characters and the show well. It's worth the Disney+ subscription, I promise.",/review/rw7583049/?ref_=tt_urv

10 December 2021,Her-Excellency,9," Great Addition to the Franchise
","I started out thinking this was a bit overdone and uninteresting, and geared toward a younger (teen) crowd, but it had just enough to keep me interested and watching when time allowed - mostly due to the dog 😉. Thankfully, not only has it steadily remained mostly entertaining, but it has consistently and continuously IMPROVED, with Episodes 3 & 4 being particularly funny, well done and simply top-notch ESPECIALLY due to the addition/inclusion/introduction of Maya Lopez.",/review/rw7583049/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2021,Homer_Ate2,1," Positive review bombing exists
","The show may have Hawkeye in it, but it is NOT about him. It's about a 22 year old girl with plot armour. Sure the story established that she's been training in martial arts, archery and fencing since 5 (qudos). But it doens't explain how she is able to confidently jump into a fight with a handful of bad guys and be totally calm throughout and afterwards. Sorry, suspension of disbelief will only take me so far.",/review/rw7583049/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2022,alekspredator87,8," The series about the ""Mascot"" of the Avengers or how Marvel says goodbye to Hawkeye
","Jeremy Renner and his character Hawkeye appear at the very beginning of the Avengers saga. Back then, there wasn't even a team of Earth's Greatest Heroes, but Clint Barton's performance took place. As the past decade of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has shown, the presence of such a team member was very welcome in any of his appearances on the screen. Barton really became one of the connecting links of the franchise, a kind of glue in the good sense of the word, without which the team could hardly exist.",/review/rw7583049/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2023,alexanderramos-33335,7," Best mcu show yet
","Best mcu show this far. Jeremy Renner was great as Hawkeye. I really liked Hailee Steinfeild as well. They both had a great chemistry. My biggest flaw was the villains, i really didn't like the deaf girl Maya or the other guy (whatever name he's was.)I liked Kingpin but he was in just one ep. I love Florence Pugh but I really dislike Yelena and i hate how she separated the main leads from fighting Kingpin together. Story I thought was a bit confusing but a good twist with Kates mom. The action was far better here than the previous shows, especially the car chase. The humor was balanced and not cringe like typical mcu humor. A really good show.",/review/rw7583049/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Hawkeye"" is yet another mediocre Marvel production vomited out by Disney Plus, full of the same woke nonsense and empty virtue signalling instead of character development and an interesting storyline. Yet another dreck where the show's namesake is only a guest while playing second fiddle to yet another empty ""bestest ever"" avatar... Which puts it pretty much in line with all the other Disney Plus/Marvel mediocrities outhere like ""WandaVision"", ""The Falcon And The Winter Soldier"" and ""Loki"".",/review/rw7583049/?ref_=tt_urv

","Just finished the first two episodes (I seriously dislike episodic releases, I will probably wait until the whole season drops before I watch the rest). Initial impressions - interesting characters, great chemistry between Clint and Kate (they are perfect foils for each other), great fight scenes (they've given Kate the Black Widow's signature move). Lots of action. Lots of fun. Love the dog. Based on the first two episodes, I'm giving this series an 8 (great) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}",/review/rw7583049/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is absolute trash. It is like they hired the directors from ""CW"" and I am getting ""CW"" Trash TV crap and not DISNEY quality. (Hell the TV show ""The Flash"" was better than this). This is not what I expected from Disney at all. I am really disappointed and I hope they make some changes to the directors really soon here. Jeremy Renner is great but Hailee seems to be a bit girlish. I was hoping to get a wonder women type character to take over the Hawkeye franchise and not a non muscular type women. I do not know what they where thinking when they where type casting! They only picked out models and not the best Physique. To me Hailee Steinfeld is non believable as an Athlete. I can see Tony Dalton as the villain! The rest of the characters are just chosen for their looks except for the original characters that where from the original Avengers movie franchise.",/review/rw7583049/?ref_=tt_urv
