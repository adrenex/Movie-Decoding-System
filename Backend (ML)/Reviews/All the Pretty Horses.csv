30 October 2014,pjr235,8," Brilliant!
","Had a great time watching this movie. I'm not a fan of 'old time-y' films but this was a good watch. The story was so that it kept my interest as I kept wondering where it was going to go with all this and I felt at one point it would turn out a bit cliché. I was wrong, and never bored getting from one scene to the next. I recommend it but I can't say much more other than I liked the cast (Don't want to spoil it). Great actors/actresses.",/review/rw3288380/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2015,planktonrules,9," One terrific film
","I loved ""Stonehearst Asylum"" and consider it among the best films I've seen recently. However, I'll be honest with you--why I like it probably isn't the reason you'd like the film. As a retired therapist and psychology teacher, I love films that talk about the history of mental health treatment--and this film is set during the bad old days of mental health treatment, when asylums were practically houses of horror. Add to this that the film is based loosely (very loosely) on an Edgar Allen Poe story and you've got most of what you'd need to capture my interest. Fortunately, the film also works when it comes to the acting--and there are some really terrific performances.",/review/rw3288380/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2014,RetroRick,9," Take your meds and watch it
","I did enjoy this film. Its a nice piece of Gothic melodrama rather than a Gothic horror (as it's made out to be) not least because its concern is to humanise rather than exploit its subject matter. 19th (and 20th) century mental asylums were fascinating and terrifying places, and fortunately or unfortunately depending on your opinion the film doesn't really explore the worst horrors that took place in those institutions. Etc is one of the 'abuses' that used to be forced on people, but since its still in some circumstances used today (as it can be effective for treating depression amongst other things) its got a slightly ambiguous status as an 'horror' treatment (although I've met people who were profoundly angry at being forced to undergo it). Despite this - the film works very well, not least because we never know quite what to expect from Ben Kingsley and the always top notch David Thewlis as the villains of the piece, and to go with the melodrama there's some genuine villainy & tragedy to keep the narrative going not to mention a few twists and turns.",/review/rw3288380/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2015,claudio_carvalho,8," One of the Best Films Released This Year
","A couple of days before 1899 Christmas, the Oxford new graduate Dr. Edward Newgate (Jim Sturgess) arrives at the Stonehearst Asylum for a training period as alienist. He is received by armed men commanded by Mickey Finn (David Thewlis) that takes him to the office of the superintendent Dr. Silas Lamb (Ben Kingsley), who tells that has not received his presentation letter but welcomes his help. Edward is surprised by the unusual treatment of Dr. Lamb that leaves the interns free in the institution instead of drugged and imprisoned. When he is introduced to the patient Eliza Graves (Kate Beckinsale), he becomes infatuated with her. He learns that she has partially mutilated the face of her abusive husband, who is a powerful man, and has been resident at the asylum since a couple of months ago. ",/review/rw3288380/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2014,cosmo_tiger,6," A movie that is good & worth seeing but with this cast it should have been better. I can see why it wasn't a big release.
","""Believe nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see."" Edward Newgate (Sturgess) has just graduated medical school and takes a job at a mental institution. When he gets to know his fellow doctors he isn't sure what to think. Little by little he begins to uncover secrets about the asylum and the more he finds out the stranger things seem. This was a good movie but at the same time it was also disappointing. I liked the idea of this and the twists were perfect and placed at the right time. None of them seemed too far fetched, but that also could have been because the movies was about an insane asylum. With a cast like this however I was expecting something a little bit better. Kate Beckinsale, Jim Sturgess, David Thewlis, Brendan Gleeson, Ben Kingsly and Michael Caine are all big name actors but the movie never rose to their level. This is a movie that is worth watching but it's best to temper your expectations when you see the cast. Overall, a movie that is good and worth seeing but with this cast I feel it could have been better. I can see why it wasn't a big theater release. I give this a disappointing B-.",/review/rw3288380/?ref_=tt_urv

","I only watched this movie because it had the word ""Asylum"" in the title (Honestly - I just hoped it would have some Arkham Asylum type crazies in it). I did not have high expectations when I started watching this movie... ",/review/rw3288380/?ref_=tt_urv

31 October 2014,m_gh_gh,9," Surprisingly good!
","I guess the IMDb rating is not anymore relevant for the quality of the movies nowadays. back then, prior to 2005, it was a good sign of distinguishing good movies from the crap, but not anymore. I guess IMDb authorities have to find ways to prevent organised efforts leading to high/low rating of the movies in their website. I have been already a victim of false ratings ,i.e. Chef, but now I read only the reviews before I watch a movie. ",/review/rw3288380/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2014,spryisfly,9," Eerily entertaining & engrossing! One to see twice!
","Surprisingly smart movie. My eyes were glued to the screen. I wanted to watch it again right after I saw it. It has a bit of a ""Shutter Island"" feel to it, however the only things similar are Ben Kingsley, a Mental institution, suspense, spoilers, a script and story that keeps you pleasantly confused, and solid acting. I was unsure whether or not I wanted to watch this movie because of middle-of-the-road reviews. I'm a serious film freak, and maybe I disagree with critics on movies with style and substance that are THIS original. I gave movies like ""Cloud Atlas,"" ""Snowpiercer,"" ""Inception,"" 9 of 10 ☆s. If you love unique films with plot twists, you'll like ""Stonehearst Asylum!""",/review/rw3288380/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2014,A_Different_Drummer,3," One of those love it or hate it films..
","Most of the reviews including those from IMDb members will emphasize how you don't see these sort of films anymore, they hark back to the Vincent Price or Hammer Films of the 60s.",/review/rw3288380/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2015,Seraphion,6," Great twists, but a bit too much at the ending
",The story presents many points of plot twists and major revelations. But for me the ending seems to be way over done particularly when compared to the story's starting point. The movie is nicely done for me. It keeps the mystery aura very thick. The flash backs and role reversals between the characters captures the audience in a very curious position. But then for me the surprise at the ending makes the finale feel way over done. The acting overall is a nice job for me. Kate Beckinsale actually loses some of her appeal but she is still quite beautiful. Jim Sturgess did quite alright as a doctor in this movie. But the main attraction is indeed Michael Caine and Ben Kingsley who did a great acting job in giving vivid live to their roles.,/review/rw3288380/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2016,Wizard-8,," Too long and drawn out
","The written works of Edgar Allan Poe have made for some fine movie adaptations over the years, like the ones Roger Corman made during the 1960s. However, this particular adaptation, while not really a BAD movie, is all the same a disappointment. The biggest problem with this movie is that it is too long and drawn out. While the opening and closing of the movie aren't too bad, the middle portion fails to hide the fact that next to NOTHING important to the plot is happening. While there may have been enough material here to make for one of the entries in a horror anthology movie, there simply isn't enough for a feature film, especially one that is almost two hours long. Also, Michael Caine fans may be disappointed that their idol doesn't have that many scenes. Caine is good, and so is the rest of the cast for that matter. The movie also has an acceptable look and good period detail. And if you really patient and manage to sit through the long slog of the middle of the movie, you will be rewarded with an unexpected twist at the end. So the movie's not really bad, though all the same it's enough of a disappointment that doesn't really warrant sitting through to see the good things about it.",/review/rw3288380/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2014,lathe-of-heaven,7," Well, it certainly is no 'SESSION 9'... But, it is a well made, entertaining film. Blu-ray: Excellent A:9 V:9
","When you've made an absolute masterpiece like 'SESSION 9' (and not everyone necessarily agrees) it is a pretty difficult thing to follow. ('SESSION 9' happens to be one of my ALL TIME favourite Horror films) So, you can imagine that my expectations were quite high, probably higher than they should have been. But, I REALLY do like a nice Classic Period Gothic Chiller (HAMMER anyone...?) and coincidentally I frigg'n LOVE Horror films about Asylums, so I was very much looking forward to seeing this.",/review/rw3288380/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2014,powell-yendi,8," A Lifetime Movie Remake on a Grander Scale.
","Naturally, the most outrageous and feared changes to social dynamics tend to make for interesting stories. Hence, a recycled plot about role transposition in an asylum is to be expected. In 2011, I saw the Lifetime movie named Committed, which has the same plot as Stonehearst Asylum. After seeing the Lifetime predecessor, nothing about this movie was surprising or unpredictable. Yet I must say that the Lifetime version paled in comparison with Stonehearst Asylum. The acting in Stonehearst topped the charts. The set was beautiful and the aura was incredibly appropriate. The scripts and costume designs were noteworthy. This movie was an overall fulfilling form of entertainment. I value a well-made movie, so Stonehearst is worth watching.",/review/rw3288380/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2017,Sleepin_Dragon,9," A top quality Gothic thriller
","This film seemingly passed me by, so I was so glad to accidentally stumble across it, I'll say categorically that this is a superb movie. It boasts a tremendous cast, with phenomenal performances in particular from Ben Kingsley and Kate Beckinsale. It boasts fantastic scenery and production values, 1889 is truly brought to life with fabulous costumes and macabre devices. It's a fantastic story, full of suspense and mystery, you feel a sense of unease from the very beginning.",/review/rw3288380/?ref_=tt_urv
