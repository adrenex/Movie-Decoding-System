30 September 2020,d-alston,4," The mistake I made was to watch the British version first.
","I decided to watch the British version through before taking a look at this, which was probably a mistake.
Instead of being gritty and interesting, the fugitives in the new version have a frothy high-school vibe, Jessica Hyde has lost the classy demeanour and the neurotic self-possession to become a thuggish brat, the personality of the child, Carl, has been watered down so that none of the powder-keg anger and rebellion springing from a childhood of neglect remains and the psychopathic assassins are nothing like as sinister, demented and quirky as the originals.
The British version demanded patience and intelligence from its viewers, while the American version dumbs-down the plot and serves up heavy exposition from the word go.
Even the bizarre and cryptic artwork from the original series, in which clues were buried, has now been transformed into a literal comic strip.
Instead of the moody and atmospheric soundscape of the first version, we now have pop music underscoring some of the transitional scenes.
This new version is glitzy and superficial where the original was stylish and deep.
Although the original version didn't conclude at the end of its final (second) season - and this one might eventually extend further to wind up the story - I'm not sure I can watch the rest of this, knowing how significantly inferior it is; I probably wouldn't have had as much of a problem if I'd only ever seen this predictably-Americanised remake.
If you only ever watch one of them, ditch this one in favour of the first.",/review/rw6126931/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2020,mega0013,6," I thought it was entertaining...until I watched the UK's original version
","I liked Amazon's Utopia enough to finish season one. I mean, being that 99.9% of American television wanders between IQ diminishing & total brain rot this series is at least watchable. But then I decided to watch the original version of Utopia that aired in the UK back in 2013. And after just 2 episodes I realized that it already put Amazon's 2020 Utopia to shame. It seems to me by americanizing Utopia Amazon turned a gem into a pacifier for the masses. By removing parts of an already great script and replacing them with America's PC ideology, Amazon made their own version become stale and a bit bland. If you like this Utopia then be sure to check out the original; which happens to be streaming on Amazon video for no cost to subscribers.",/review/rw6126931/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2021,rsvp321,," Watched this, gave it a ""9"", then watched the UK version...

1 October 2020,DrProfessor,4," Cringe worthy.
","This show was made for a younger demographic than the original. Having high hopes for this, I was terribly disappointed when after just a few minutes, I realized that this is more like, 'Bride of Chucky', than it was like, 'Saw'.",/review/rw6126931/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2021,thebricks,1," Watch the UK version instead, this is like a parody of that one
","Anyone remember when someone satirized the proposed American Akira remake? This show pretty much is just like that. I saw Utopia premiere on Amazon Prime some months ago. I watched that first, the US version, had absolutely no idea what was going on and turned off. Hated the show. I saw the UK versions also on Prime but figured if the US one was so bad, the UK one could only be worse.",/review/rw6126931/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2021,A_Different_Drummer,4," There is no shame..
",".. in trying to recreate a classic. Sometimes it works. Not just time. The casting is more aggressive, the faces are slicker, but the writing, the delivery, the direction are all MEH. The creepy vibe of the British version is nowhere to be found.",/review/rw6126931/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2020,andrew-hill515,3," Go home Utopia you're drunk
","As far as I can tell the script writer and show runner have never seen the show this was rebooting. If someone read a synopsis of the show, waited 2 weeks so it was fuzzy, got drunk and described it to a hack writer, it would be a bit like this US version.",/review/rw6126931/?ref_=tt_urv

25 September 2020,teutonfirst,8," I haven't seen the original
","SO my review is not subjective. Maybe I will watch the British after. So far, I enjoyed it. It's shocking, brutal, mystic and took me by surprise. I guess for those who saw the original they feel entitled to gave it one star, but the show is far better than one star for a tv serie and far better for those who didn't see the original.",/review/rw6126931/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2020,s3276169,4," Lacks the crunch of the original from the UK....
","How to describe the US remake of the UK series ""Utopia""? Imagine taking a fresh crisp apple, dunking it in preservative, shrink wrapping it in plastic and putting it in garishly wrapped box with ""fresh apples on the label.",/review/rw6126931/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2020,southdavid,7," Hyde and Seek
","I am another devotee of the original version of ""Utopia"" which always comes up as an underseen gem, whenever such lists are made. I quite enjoyed this retelling, though I'm not sure the increase in scale and scope was necessary and it may go down as literally the worst timed release to a series of all time.",/review/rw6126931/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2020,freqeteq,5," Unimaginative Remake
","The very first thing you see in the first episode of Utopia are the opening credits, opening credits that consist of a montage of generic stock footage. This opening sequence sums up the US remake of Utopia nicely, unimaginative. It doesn't even feel like the show is trying to have any kind of identity of its own. I wasn't expecting it to be as stylized as the UK version was, I didn't expect them to try and copy what the UK show did, but didn't expect it to be as bland as it is either. A good example of how uninspired the show feels is the music, something that has become iconic from the UK version because of Cristobal Tapia de Veer's score, but here it sounds like music that could be from any number of syndicated police procedural shows, it's forgettable and bland and I doubt anyone will be adding the music from the show to their playlists any time soon. And it's not just the music, everything feels generic like they're doing just the bare minimum to get a scene done instead of trying to create something unique that's memorable and stands out. I think I've seen one interesting camera shot in the first two episodes.",/review/rw6126931/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2020,W011y4m5,5," Watch the UK original instead.
","To be quite frank, I'm a huge admirer of the crew involved with both productions of UTOPIA (the original & the reboot) & therefore, did initially have faith in those who were tasked with helming the remake - due to their previous impressive credentials... But surprisingly, creator & executive producer Gillian Flynn (none other than the author of groundbreaking masterpieces like ""Gone Girl"" & ""Sharp Objects"") - a writer I completely adore & respect - did undeniably get it completely wrong here. There's clearly no excusing that.",/review/rw6126931/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2020,jamiekressinger,6," It's ok but it's NOT the UK version.
",It's only half decent cause the uk version was great. Just like most shows the USA copies they mess it up a bit.,/review/rw6126931/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2020,roxmewild,3," Not for me
",I have watched first 5 episodes and to be honest I think this was intended for a young teen audience as apart from the seriousness of the concept the actors and script are very immature and so very very underwhelming!,/review/rw6126931/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2020,ranwulfs,5," Had no idea this was a remake of an earlier British series.
","I just finished binge watching this, and thought it went waaaay downhill in the last several episodes. Really disappointed with how the season ended.
But what really frustrates me is it *isn't* some original, visionary stuff as advertised: it was a much better 2013-14 British television show first. I'm watching it over on YouTube as I write this. Watching the Brit version after seeing the American one, you can see how the original elements were adapted and twisted. No idea why someone thought it was necessary to dumb it down for us 'muricans. Another reviewer commented the artwork in the graphic novel within the story is much, much better in the American version, and I agree. But that's a small thing. Everything else in the British version is better, as you'd expect.",/review/rw6126931/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2020,TheFarscapeProject747,9," The original was brilliant, this works too
","Ok so don't listen to the people who were determined to hate this show for the simple fact that the US had the gall to remake a show from the UK. For months I've seen ""why does the US remake all of UK shows? Can't they come up with their own?"" To that I say come on you know that the majority of US shows they make are their own and original. Anyway after having seen said original and loving it I was skeptical by the horribly made trailer but as it turns out the show is actually really good. Yes it's the same story with a different spin but still good. I'm not sure why theres hate for the actors being better looking like really that's what you focus on? And to the one person who said that this show claims it's original and gives credit only to Gillian Flynn than they chose to overlook the fact that original creator Dennis Kelly is an EP and is mentioned in the opening credits. So go into this as if it's an adaptation from a book and judge it on it's own merits.",/review/rw6126931/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2020,darrel076,3," Utopia UK is the only Utopia.
","I don't know what trash this is supposed to be ,but the great story of Utopia it is not. The creators should be embarrassed. The original UK Utopia is such a good show. This doesn't come close; with idiot characters, violence with no heart behind it and a storyline that crumbles apart each episode . Skip this ,watch Utopia 2013.",/review/rw6126931/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2020,lexxierjosei,4," It fails both as a remake and a separate show.

3 October 2020,saccitygrl,3," Truly Americanized
","So you get great source material and decide to jump the pond and bring it to a new audience. What happens--the same thing that happens in every american film/series--scrap the characterization, scrap character arcs, amp up the violence.
The original series is AWESOME in every way. But truth be told it never caught on because of the grotesque violence. It is very violent--think Layer Cake. However, the violence served the PLOT--this trash just tosses it in as shock and awe effect.
In the process the storyline/conspiracy becomes less and less plausible and the motivations of the characters becomes more and more elusive.",/review/rw6126931/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2020,jacknlowe,3," They lost me with Episode 2
","Too much gratuitous killing of innocents. You kind of get why the 2 Harvest henchmen wipe out Wilson's family...but the supposed ""hero"" of the story kills off a promising character who only wanted to help people and save the world. For what? Just to make an example and terrify the group into blindly following her. Completely unnecessary and stupid. That makes the main character just as bad as the supposed bad guys (The Harvest). And I'm supposed to root for her? I don't think so. Stopped watching this crap and will look for the fabled BBC original which is supposed to be so much better.",/review/rw6126931/?ref_=tt_urv

","I had to write a review to warn others of how terrible this tv show is. I forced myself to watch it until the end in case it improved, sadly it did not. It´s a complete waste of time and a burden to watch. I did not enjoy this one bit.",/review/rw6126931/?ref_=tt_urv
