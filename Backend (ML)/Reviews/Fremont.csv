11 January 2020,SnoopyStyle,6," some flaws but still good
",Rookie cop Alicia West (Naomie Harris) is returning to patrol her childhood New Orleans neighborhood. Her body camera records narcotics detective Terry Malone (Frank Grillo) executing his drug dealers to hide his drug deals before a coming wave of investigations. Malone and his police accomplices pursue West through the devastated neighborhood as they seek to eliminate the body camera. She finds help from reluctant local Mouse (Tyrese Gibson).,/review/rw5220337/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2019,Fella_shibby,7," Decent thriller with sufficient tension n action.
","The film is a about a female cop who goes on the run after she witnesses a murder. The plot has been done umpteenth no of times.
Cops burning 50 percent of the confiscated drugs n they sell off the remaining 50 thru their dealers n when things get heavy they try to cut loose ends.
The best part about this film is Miss Moneypenny's acting. The star cast is decent, we have Frank Grillo n Tyrese Gibson.
Grillo must be tired doing the same kinda roles but he is good at it.
It was so good to c Gibson aft long time sans Fast n Furious.",/review/rw5220337/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2020,bob the moo,," Endlessly generic but at least distracting; irony of the cast is that they both lift it, and deserve much better
","I've been a fan of Naomie Harris since she was in White Teeth, and I was interested to see this thriller with her in the lead, even if the trailer and everything I heard about it told me it would be generic at best. Unsurprisingly this is what it was - the type of thriller that you could stop after 15 minutes and pretty much guess the rest. Of course the reason why we know this type of plot is that some films have done it really well and made it a model to be leant on, but not this film. Instead it plays it out in the most obvious way, with little effort in the writing and no twists or turns to even vaguely excite - everything is heavily signposted as if they didn't trust the viewer to get anything by themselves. As it goes where you expect, it delivers enough distracting scenes to manage to get by, but everything is heavy-handed. The title is pretty obvious in its meaning, but it doesn't do anything clever with it, but it leans all over it from the very start. The actual thriller elements are also fairly basic and hard to believe and there was so much scope to be tighter and better.",/review/rw5220337/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2021,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," I liked it better than the film critics did
","Not sure why they nitpicked on this one so hard - maybe they can't stand all the bogus high single-film reviewers, but still, far too many haters as well. I for one enjoyed it. The directing was on point, the screenplay was well put together with excellent pacing for the 108 min runtime. Sure there were a few plot issues and some cliches, but it was still very suspenseful and entertaining. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. Cinematography and score were decent, and the casting and all performances were excellent. It's refreshing to be satisfyingly impressed when going in with low expectations. It's a very deserving 8/10 from me. To see how I review films, or read more of my 1000+ reviews, click on my username.",/review/rw5220337/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2019,skullcrushergurl,9," Gripping and suspenseful!
",I have NO idea where these bad reviews are coming from. The movie was just released today! Anyway the story was gripping. It does touch on where identity and being a cop intersect but at the end of the day right is right and wrong is wrong no matter who you are. The acting (especially by Naomi Harris and Tyrese) is phenomenal. Very suspenseful and action packed.,/review/rw5220337/?ref_=tt_urv

","I kept this movie aside for quite sometime reading the poor reviews. I watched it after the recommendation of a friend. The movie was a pleasant surprise. A very good thriller with good suspense. Also, I learned that I shouldn't be always falling for the negative comments of users. Many of them gave negative review as the cops were shown as the criminals. But then there are good and bad people among priests also.",/review/rw5220337/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2019,jmdillehay,7," Haters gonna hate
",Solid movie. It was very tense and entertaining. I get the feeling that the super low ratings are from people that hate the message. I mean seriously...a 1/10? Thats silly. I guess the low rating people are either unaware or turn a blind eye to police brutality and corruption. Do a little research and you will find that the NOPD has a long history of corruption. I rate it a 7/10 based on the movie outside of the message. I would not be surprised if the same people that hated black and blue loved training day because the lead is a corrupt cop black man. This is not a bad film at all.,/review/rw5220337/?ref_=tt_urv

25 October 2019,onggiachay_max,8," To some bad reviewers!
","Ok let's get this straight. The movie is pretty good to me. Some ""American traditional"" social problems are depicted strongly and its script is great also. I am not a drama person but I feel that it is a bit weird when most of bad reviews are made just because the content points out some cops are bad?! Really guys, isn't that not true? Guys, bad people are everywhere, they can be teachers, doctors and of course they can be cops. It's absolutely logical and makes sense. No matter if you are a real patriot or not, you can't deny this fact. It would be silly to rate the whole performance 1 star just because you don't accept this truth. Please don't be rude and make your reviews fairly so this website can bring its true value to everyone. To those who don't see the movie yet, there is nothing wrong with it, just spend some bucks buying tickets yourself, your sweetheart and families and enjoy the movie. I promise everything's gonna fine! Don't put your trust on haters!",/review/rw5220337/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2019,ayojerkinskarega,7," Not as bad as the rating
","Very interesting narrative about police and race relations; but because of how the movie was executed, it falls short. Ok writing, acting, and plot. The main character, Alicia West played by Naomi Harris, story was pretty good. At times, because of the directing, her acting wasn't believable. Also, because of the spotty development of the secondary characters, it was hard to have any empathy towards them. In contrast, great use of background aka mise-en-scene, to deliver a message to the viewers that are watching. Lastly, I do like the overall message of the film which is that we all are people (especially black people and other people of color) and all we want is to be treated as such.",/review/rw5220337/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2020,Johnny_West,5," Pretty Good, Faster Pace Needed
","Hundreds of movies about police corruption have been made, including Another 48 Hours. Nobody made a big deal about the race issue. I did not care. I remember the Alien Nation TV series had a couple of episodes about corrupt alien cops. It is just a story, and the important thing is whether or not it works.",/review/rw5220337/?ref_=tt_urv

26 October 2019,xomlaodong,7," Disregard the super low reviews! Not fair...
","I didn't know why this movie had a low review. Went to watch it then thought, ""Ohhh, now I see why."" The low reviews probably come biased with the bad publicity for law enforcement lately. This movie portrayed some issues that happen to relate to law enforcement but sticks to its own plot for the sake of its own ENTERTAINMENT VALUE instead of political statement.",/review/rw5220337/?ref_=tt_urv

","Naomi Harris is a rookie New Orleans cop. On her first night ride, her instructor tells her to stay in the car, but gunfire draws her out. She turns on her body camera and is witness to her partner taking part in a gang execution. Soon she's wounded and trying to get the footage, with every hand raised against her.",/review/rw5220337/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2019,stevendbeard,6," Rookie vs Bad Cops
","I saw ""Black and Blue"", starring Naomie Harris-Rampage, Moneypenny in the Daniel Craig Bond movies; Frank Grillo-The Purge:Election Year, Captain America:The Winter Soldier; Tyrese Gibson-the Fast & the Furious movies, the Transformers movies and Mike Colter-Luke Cage_tv, The Good Wife.
This is a cop thriller with a rookie cop vs bad cops. Naomie is the rookie cop that winds up in the wrong place, where a drug dealer is meeting some dirty cops. Things go from bad to worse when the bad cops-led by Frank-kill the unarmed dealers in cold blood. Naomie gets the whole transaction on her body cam, which starts a dangerous game of hide & seek with her hiding and the bad cops seeking her and her body cam. To make matters worse, Frank puts out the word that Naomie did the killing and the dead dealers uncle-a big drug dealer himself, played by Mike-puts out a bounty on Naomie's head, so just about everyone is after her; good cops, bad cops, drug dealers, drug dealers' friends, etc. Tyrese plays a local store owner that is about the only person that will even try to help her get her body cam footage to someone that can be trusted to put it to good use. There is not much new here-as far as plots go-but it is executed decently.
It's rated ""R"" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-one viewing is enough-but it would be alright as a rental.",/review/rw5220337/?ref_=tt_urv

3 November 2019,matthewssilverhammer,3," Color Me Disappointed
","Get Out was the best film of 2017 for many reasons, not least of which was its powerful ending. In a matter of a few seconds, it captures America's struggle between the black and cop communities with immense creative grace and emotional class. Black and Blue does the exact opposite. With no clear point-of-view, it serves to only propagate the deep divisions within our culture, without having anything of nuance to say about it. What the pontificating and insufferable John Q was to the American healthcare system, Black and Blue is to police corruption.
When a rookie cop has her body-cam capture corrupt cops killing a drug-dealer, she becomes stuck between the warring factions of the lower-class black community and the police. When the chase begins, the film has an early-90s Saturday matinee feel to it, with some solid thrills and surprises. Unfortunately, that suspense is short-lived, buried under cartoonish villains and even an inability to get the basics of storytelling right.
Worse yet, I don't think the words ""subtlety"" or ""subtext"" were ever once understood by the filmmakers. Without exaggeration, at least 90% of the dialogue is an incessant diatribe on something we already know: systemic police corruption is bad, and the black community has suffered most from it. If the movie trusted our awareness of this, it could've spent more time on developing its characters and plot.
As for the morality of the film, my stance as a highly-privileged white man should be taken with a giant pile of salt. However, the film's biggest problem may be its disinterest in having an opinion. To stay bipartisan, it unintentionally demonizes all sides; it's hard to imagine people from either camp walking away feeling happy. It's a shame because I think there's a good movie to be mined here, but this isn't it.",/review/rw5220337/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2019,roman-dadiomoff,9," Full of Suspense
",This is an excellent movie that exceeded expectations. My wife and I got to go to an advance screening and were expecting a solid 6 but it blew our socks off. Naomie Harris is phenomenal and her character Alicia's backstory is what made this such a good movie. To have grown up on those streets and know the people but to leave and serve in the Army to come back as a cop (presumably after her mother dies after you see her moms tombstone at the very beginning). This story is a great example about how one person can make a difference and that committing a crime is wrong no matter who does it.,/review/rw5220337/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2020,pkdyer1965,8," Justice Is Not a Colour
","Having not a favourable review from some critics I went into this with a open mind, I wasn't expecting such a gripping compelling thriller.
This is up with the best of recent crime thrillers, it starts with ex army rookie cop brilliantly played by Naomie Harris witness bent cops on her cam killing a gang member.
It races a great speed gripping at every turn, seeing if our hero can save herself and execute justice.
One of the best films of 2019 a throughly recommend thriller.",/review/rw5220337/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2019,subxerogravity,6," The message was loud and their is a good movie under it.
","It's one of those movies made to pull at the emotional strings of a certain audience. Everything about this movie was niche to black folks tired of police brutality and this movie is all about justice for those who get none. Every single scene will have you shouting at the screen if you know what if feels like to be targeted by the cops cause of the color of your skin.
The point that they were trying to make registered, but the movie was not bad at the same time. It Had some good action, very suspenseful and I especially liked Nomi Harris and Frank Grillo as the opposing sides

19 November 2019,insideatl,5," Decent Thriller
","The acting was above average good performances by Tyrese Gibson and Naomie Harris. Harris did well considering the plot gets basic fast. The plot wasn't all bad it just lacked creativity, there was definite room for improvement. The film was entertaining but then it kind of becomes very predictable; you're really waiting to see how it's going to end. Overall it's a decent thriller; not bad but not good either.",/review/rw5220337/?ref_=tt_urv
