","With Matthew Vaughn at the helm, X-Men: First Class is a classy, fun time that brings the best out of it's strong cast. The action scenes and dialogue pop with a ferocity, and breaths life into a incredibly engaging storyline.",/review/rw2443862/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2020,UniqueParticle,10," Fantastic X-Men prequel
","Exhilarating action, formidable foes, well written, and highly entertaining throughout! I love Matthew Vaughn films or least most of them he's very good at his craft. Kevin Bacon is always great at villain roles along with the rest of the cast is so good. Part of me remembers seeing this in the theater that was fun especially then I had people to go with, in the last several years I mostly go by myself I hope that changes eventually either way X: First Class is exactly what you want it to be!",/review/rw2443862/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2020,Med-Jasta,10," Possibly the best X-Men movie
","After X3 and Wolverine Origin our expectations for the X-Men franchise were pretty low if not gone completely. This seemed like a last ditch effort by Fox to make something out of X-Men. When pictures were being released I laughed at them with my friend. Beast looked weird and everything looked cheap. I went to the theater thinking, ""I don't know why I'm seeing this it's gonna be stupid.""",/review/rw2443862/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2011,rachel-673-19946,9," A prequel that does not, in any way, suck. Amazing, isn't it?
","There came a point, about half way through this film, when I emerged from the world of wonder on screen, took stock of my emotions in that instant, and realized that yes, by God, I am LOVING this movie.",/review/rw2443862/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2011,the_rattlesnake25,8," A franchise is reborn...
","Beginning with a crime-thriller and a fantasy film on his directorial résumé, it is safe to say that Matthew Vaughn may have already found his niche genre in the super-hero field despite only directing four films in seven years. His first super-hero project, 'Kick Ass,' opened in 2010 to solid critical acclaim and a finalized gross of three times the film's ordinary $30 million dollar budget. And after only two years, Vaughn returns with 'X-Men: First Class,' an origins story to accompany the Bryan Singer/Brett Ratner X-Men trilogy released between 2000 and 2006. It's intelligent, enthralling, well-acted, stylishly directed, and most importantly by focusing heavily upon the relationship between the two central protagonists, it does not feel like a conventional super-hero film.",/review/rw2443862/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2011,RikerDonegal,10," Superb! Rock-solid script, two amazing lead performances (the film is basically a bromance).
","What you need to know about this movie before you go and see it.  1. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are superb. Each one, alone,  would have made the movie terrific, but together? Forgetaboutit! Every  step of the way, every scene, every emotion, these two men own the  movie and watching their bromance is a treat from start to finish. Make  no mistake about it, even when the world is on the brink of utter  destruction what really matters is how these two men relate to one  another. And when you watch the movie, you will care.  2. Everyone in the cast is good. Kevin Bacon has never been better, and  Jennifer Lawrence is wonderful. Rose Byrne and January Jones aren't  given much to do, Ray Wise and Michael Ironside only have a few short  lines, but - across the board - the entire cast are a delight.  3. The story is tight. You've got a bad guy with a plan, which he sets  about executing in A/B/C fashion. Against him, the good guys work  together. Their motivations are different, of course, but they pretty  much want him stopped so they unite. That's it.  4. Charles and Erik are fascinating characters. They debate. And  viewers can debate endless about them, and about who is right, etc. As  you watch you desperately wish they could stay friends, but you  understand why they ultimately can't. Even if they themselves, in these  early days, don't understand it yet. To have that so perfectly captured  in a Summer Blockbuster movie is part of what makes this a treat and a  future classic. But, aside from their relationship to each other, the  movie takes time to make each of them interesting in his own right. We  get to see Charles as a teacher, for instance, and come to understand  how he impacts upon the lives of those he tutors. Some of Erik's best  moments (away from Charles) are in his comments to Mystique about her  appearance, making it clear that this man has more to him than the  shadow of his past.  4. Most supporting characters have very little screen time. But that's  okay, since this isn't THEIR story, really. Of the bunch, it is  Mystique and Beast who are best served. Both have terrific character  arcs that - in a lesser X-Men movie - might have been the highlight of  the film. Here, their stories serve as quality background material to  the main event (Charles and Erik). Beyond that, we just learn enough  about everyone to know what they can do and like them a little bit,  mostly through their banter and most obvious character traits. Once  scene where most of the supporting characters are clearly terrified  will certainly go a long way towards making you care about them for the  rest of the movie. On the downside: Shaw's two henchmen don't get  ANYTHING to do except use their powers, and at the end of the story we  know as much about Emma Frost as we did at the beginning. But these are  the exception, not the rule.  5. Visually, this movie is a treat. The FX are good, no surprise, but -  much better - the actual sets/costumes are beautiful. Whether it's a  remote CIA lab or a lap-dance club, whether it's the Magneto helmet or  Mystique's everyday clothes, you are always admiring 'the look' of  what's on screen.  6. There are action scenes all during the movie, but - having said that  - the movie builds as it goes. The first half is more  story-heavy/character-heavy so that when the action REALLY starts we  care about everyone. And, again, it works. Even with the scant details  given their characters, when Banshee and Havok (for example) go into  battle you are invested in them to a certain degree.  7. There are surprises. Deaths, betrayals, cameos and name-dropping.  But, as well as being cool, all of this makes perfect sense for the  story/universe of the movies.  Superb! Rock-solid script, two amazing lead performances (the film is  basically a bromance). Haven't been this excited about the X-Men  franchise since X2: X-Men United.",/review/rw2443862/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2011,McGrit,," X Marks again marks the spot! Great Film!
","There are plenty of big action scenes throughout but it's the first half of the film that really impresses. Establishing these characters and the entire universe is done remarkably well and in a remarkably moving manner. This new spin on familiar ""bad guys"" Magneto and Mystique does give the actions and emotions for the characters a new level of appreciation and helps give them so much more depth and pathos. Both sides of the fence (Xavier's vision and Magneto's contempt) are advanced and the brilliance of the plot is that both sides are understandable and relatable. The viewer can simply sit and watch it unfold but also be emotionally invested in the journey. During the second half, plot threads move towards resolution and action picks up. Xavier is a shining example and his journey throughout the film matches that of Erik.",/review/rw2443862/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2011,moviexclusive,9," A first-class summer blockbuster that packs awesome action, great character drama and outstanding lead performances to restore the X Men franchise back to glory
","The X Men movies followed a similar trajectory to another Marvel property ""Spiderman""- the first movie was a surprising blast, the second built on the merits of the first to deliver ever bigger and better thrills, but the third just knocked the wind out of the sails. And so like any self-respecting franchise would do, you go back to the beginning and start all over again- well, in this case, much much further back to the beginning.",/review/rw2443862/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2011,Joejoesan,8," The best prequel movie ever made... period
","Normally prequel movies are made because the main characters of the first movie died (or in the end achieved their goals) and the producers still want to make money out of the franchise. Think Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid, Psycho, the (still to be made?) I am legend and of course George Lucas's Star Wars saga. X-Men First Class also falls into that category, but I cannot imagine that anybody will be complaining about that. Director Matthew Vaughn created a great, thrilling and sometimes even moving picture that without any doubt will get raving reviews and be a huge commercial success. God knows both movie and director deserve it.",/review/rw2443862/?ref_=tt_urv

","In 1944, in Poland, the boy Erik Lehnsherr unleashes his magnetic power when his mother is sent to a concentration camp. The evil Dr. Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) brings Erik to his office and kills his mother, increasing his abilities through anger. In New York, the wealthy Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) meets the mutant Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) and invites her to live in his manor.",/review/rw2443862/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2011,TheLittleSongbird,8," A very good and fresh prequel/reboot
","I liked this movie a great deal, while not as good as the first two movies it is an improvement on Wolverine. It is not among my favourite superhero movie but I can think of worse. It is not perfect by all means, while it was good to start with with a touch of atmosphere some of the music later on became rather generic and Jennifer Lawrence I had mixed feelings on, great looks and personality but sometimes forced delivery and her character being not as well developed as the rest. The visuals however are spectacular, with imaginative photography and editing and first-class special effects, costumes, lighting and settings. The story is mostly compelling with the action/thriller based moments genuinely intense and cracking while making way for some nuances on the social and political side of things. The script is well written too with some memorable lines, the film is well paced generally and Matthew Vaughan's direction is what makes the film so fresh. The acting is fine mostly, Kevin Bacon is a good and charismatic villain but James McAvoy and especially Michael Fassbender are terrific. Overall, very good and fresh. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2443862/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2011,Movie_Muse_Reviews,9," The origin story that the ""X-Men"" universe deserves
","Superhero movies have been thriving in both Hollywood and public consciousness for almost 10 years now, and one of the biggest reasons has been the origin story. ""Spider-Man"" in 2002 revealed how the emotional power of a superhero's motivation can humanize even those characters with the most extraordinary powers. ""X-Men: First Class"" provides this oh so necessary background to a franchise whose last two film entries sacrificed depth of character for mutant and superpower pageantry. Wolverine might be the most popular character from the ""X-Men"" world, but the story of how Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr developed two different ideologies and became Professor X and Magneto encapsulates the comics' core. ""First Class"" recognizes this all the way.",/review/rw2443862/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2011,Logan8888,," Grand-Scale Storytelling Mixed With Superb Action
","Fox can breath easy again because I think it's safe to say the even the extreme fanboys will be putting down their pitchforks and torches and smile after seeing this amazing film. I know for a fact that general audiences are going to love this movie. I know some fans can be irrational and hold on to their hate because they expect certain things they read in their books but I can't seeing anyone being that irrational when faced with a result that delivers what First Class manages to deliver. It honestly is a genre-defining movie on a level with any comic based film that has come before it. Everything in this movie is exceedingly better than what Fox delivered in their last two efforts with this franchise. Going back to the beginning and re-hiring the guy that brought us those films was a splendid idea. The acting here is superb and the dialogue is rich. Every character feels absolutely believable no matter what abilities they have on display. No cartoonish villains or cheese in sight, every side of the issue is presented by people who believe they are the ones who are in the right and the underlying message of tolerance and bigotry only add to the depth of this film. If not a genre-defining movie than maybe it redefines the comic book genre. It restores the sense of epic adventure and grand-scale storytelling that we saw in X2. In fact, it perfectly complements that great film and probably surpasses it.",/review/rw2443862/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2011,mad_mandonna,8," Clever, exciting, funny and stylish. What more could you want?
","I love the Xmen, I won't beat around the bush. There are so many mutants, heroes and anti-heroes that you relate can to at least one of them. The franchise has had its ups and downs. The first two films made the superhero genre what it is today. Stunning set pieces, breath taking special effects and a group dynamic that was brilliantly cemented in the second film. The third struck a middle ground where the spectacle overshadowed the narrative but was still a fun ride, and the last title Xmen Origins: Wolverine, was the only miss-step in the series. Xmen first Class is really very good. It manages to keep up with the first two whilst retaining an originality in its own right.",/review/rw2443862/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,jonnyhavey,9," ""Fluid Pace: Classy and Stylish Prequel""
","Director Matthew Vaughn is back for a more conventional super hero movie after wowing audiences with last year's ""Kick Ass."" He has redefined the ""X-Men"" series with a very stylish work of cinema as attempt two at creating a prequel is successful with ""X-Men: First Class."" Like ""Origins"" there are a plethora of characters that the audience has to worry about, however, with the smart use of time and space Vaughn develops the roots of various mutants with a fluid pace. James McAvoy (""Wanted"", ""The Conspirator"") and Michael Fassbender (""Inglourious Bastards"",""300"") set up the best on screen matchup of the year with their respective portrayals of Charles Xavier (Professor X) and Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto). The film commences as Erik is separated from his mother and killed by a man named Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon, ""Frost/Nixon""). This is followed by background of a young Charles as he befriends a very familiar character, Raven aka Mystic (Academy Award Nominee Jennifer Lawrence, ""Winter's Bone""). After this brief exposition, the audience is taken on a nonstop thrill ride as the mutants influence the Cold War. Erik embarks on a path of vengeance to kill Shaw. Since their last encounter Shaw has started his own mutant army and has a very dangerous right-hand woman, Emma Frost (January Jones, ""Mad Men""). Meanwhile, Charles and Raven are tracked down by a woman named Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne, ""Bridesmaids"") for their mutant expertise. Everything is connected in one way or another as the 1960s setting makes the film a cool cinematic rebirth to a new ""X-Men Trilogy.""",/review/rw2443862/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2014,Leofwine_draca,5," Superhero prequel fails to breathe new life into tired franchise
",X-MEN: FIRST CLASS is a film that aims to breathe new life into a somewhat tired franchise (so far consisting of the original trilogy and two stand-alone Wolverine stories) by telling the back story of the Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen characters from the original movies.

3 June 2011,wafeys,9," Almost pitch-perfect!.... An X-tremely good job!
","What stands out in this movie (besides the look of some of the mutants), is the clever way in which all the pieces fall into place as a prequel which cements the backdrop and tone for the previous X-men offers. This one however, stands above them though for the consideration and tact that has gone into developing these understandably complex characters. Resulting in a more complete movie experience.",/review/rw2443862/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2011,Aaron1375,9," This X-men movie is a first class ride.
","This X-men movie was great, out of all the X-men films this one ranks second to the second as X2 still holds the title as number one X-men film. This one is not to far behind, the only reason I did not give it a 10 are some problems this one has when tied with the other films. I know they say it is a reboot, but if that were the case why were there so many things tying this to the other films? Seriously, in a reboot you would change costumes and looks of characters, in this one when the young X-men wear their costumes for the first time Beast's costume looks like the one he wore in The Last Stand when he commented that he could not believe it used to fit him. That and it opened with a scene that looked as if it came right out of the first film, the awakening of a young Magento's powers. Enough of whether it is a prequel or a reboot, what it was for me was an entertaining film. The story has Eric (later to be known as Magneto) trying to find the man responsible for the death of his mother, a man who goes by the name of Sebastian Shaw. Meanwhile, Charles Xavier is writing papers and is a bit of a flirt as he and a young woman by the name of Raven have formed a special bond. Well it is not long before the two meet up as there is a wonderful scene where Eric finds Sebastian, and the army finds them both on Sebastian's boat. They soon join up and begin recruiting other mutants as Shaw has other mutants working for him so they think they need more to help in their struggle against him. The action is great here culminating in a great battle at the end and the full awakening of Magneto's powers. The effects are really good in this one too as is the acting. Nice to see Kevin Bacon in an extended role in this movie, when I first saw he was going to appear in this one I was afraid it would be nothing more than an extended cameo. The guy they got to play Magneto was great as I could actually see him looking like Ian McKellen when he ages. The guy playing Xavier is good too, just do not see him looking much like Patrick Stewart, but this goes back to the point of whether this is a prequel to those films or a reboot. I am sorry, but to me it seems like a prequel so the thing that happens to Charles at the end of this one does not really work in the context of the third film as in that one he and Eric visit a young Jean Grey and Charles is walking, also the fact that at the end of this one they are essentially against each other so chances are they would not be visiting her together unless even Eric felt her powers were in need of guidance at the time so he agreed to accompany Charles because of her being such a special case. Also, the end of Wolverine has an appearance of Charles at the end and he is walking, this one can be explained as the appearance of Charles could be akin to what Emma Frost did to the Russian dude here in that he simply made himself appear to the young X-men. Like I said though this may be a reboot making all these points groundless except for the many things tying this film to the other four movies. Other than this gripes it was a totally solid film, the best I have seen so far in the summer of 2011, mind you there are still many movies I intend to see. I also have to say this film features one of the best villain deaths ever, of course after that death the birth of one of the best villains ever begins.",/review/rw2443862/?ref_=tt_urv

","After X-Men Origins: Wolverine botched the franchise's first prequel; it's understandable why this movie was met with some trepidation. Thankfully, where that movie failed...this one succeeds, and unlike other prequels, it offers some surprises. Although we begin in familiar territory with an almost-shot-for-shot redo of the first movie's opening, as young Erik Lehnsherr's separated from his parents, causing him to manifest his powers (bending a gate), *this* time we see there's more going on, as a scientist (played by Kevin Bacon) wants another demonstration of Erik's power, which he's unable to do until his mother is killed...THEN he shows what he's capable of (including crushing soldiers' heads with their own helmets).",/review/rw2443862/?ref_=tt_urv
