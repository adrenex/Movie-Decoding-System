27 May 2021,bestford,9," Kate Kate captain Lee
","Mmmm let's start with Kate a mean girl who thinks she's a really all round nice gal. News flash she's not. She's every bully I've ever met rolled Into one person. Captain Lee, Kates very own personal assistant. Can be an over the top disciplinarian, and other times a wise old mentor. The others crew mates are a various bunch of misfits with various issues. Yet I love it so... I guess that kind of makes me a hypocrite. Oh well...",/review/rw7899840/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2017,DonutLover,," Strangely Captivating and Addicting
","As someone who is not able to enjoy a vacation this summer, I have turned to ""Below Deck"" as well as ""Below Deck Mediterranean"" as the opportunity to witness blue, inviting oceans and all sets of fun water toys as well as foreign lands that I have never seen. Something about watching the sea every day soothes my hot soul and helps me plan for summers ahead in which I will be the participant in the cool, delicious ocean play.",/review/rw7899840/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2021,tom-456,3," Unrealistic reality where too much drama is contrived for the show
","There's enough drama in one episode of this silly show to last the real thing for several years. Too much of the conflict among the yacht crew is created for the benefit of the camera, in order that people will watch the show. And Captain Lee, to say it plainly, behaves perpetually like a jerk. He is not a leader. I dislike the fact that his conduct is portrayed by the show as leadership, while the truth is that his conduct is perpetually a very good example of poor leadership. His favorite trick is to put direct subordinates between himself and the working crew, when he knows that the working crew are screwups and that his direct subordinates have little if any experience in managing people. Then when the screwups screw up, he gets to rake his subordinates over the coals. This is all a big setup for the benefit of the home viewer. It would be nice to see an above-board documentary of how the crew on a small chartered yacht operates when it isn't all put on for the home viewer.",/review/rw7899840/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2016,BobbyG,9," This is Actually a Good Show
","I won't explain the plot or setting of this series. Just read the previous reviews. It doesn't seem like it would be possible to make this interesting, but somehow the people involved in the production have made it ""must watch"" TV. You could call it a guilty pleasure, but the show is very engaging; mainly the interaction between crew and customers (personality conflicts on display regularly). Below Deck demonstrates how challenging it is to run a private cruise ship and how difficult it is to obtain employees with the proper work ethic and temperament to get the job done. The production values of Below Deck are impressive with the editing being top-notch. Some of it might be contrived because it's hard to believe this concept could be this absorbing, but I recommend it highly for those with time to kill.",/review/rw7899840/?ref_=tt_urv

24 January 2021,bubsta-38437,8," Watched one season, just had to watch the rest
","Others have described this as a guilty pleasure. I have to agree with that. This is an interesting snapshot into human behaviour, it is not like most reality shows in the way that it is more of a snapshot of the lives of people rather than people put into an environment.",/review/rw7899840/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2020,grantwrathall,7," Great programme. Funny. Idiots galore
","This programme is classic. The crew are very interesting. The clients,although not always, are loke spoilt rich kids (the girls). In they act like kids. The staff drama is great. The pretty ladies that melt down allll the time. And the pretty boys with GIANT EGOS.. lol. Go Ashton. He has a crazy huge EGO. Loves himself. Haha. And it always works.

29 July 2021,safenoe,7," The Love Boat and more
","I started watching this last year when I had lots more time to watch shows that I discovered while channel-surfing. Below Deck is a guilty pleasure for sure, but so what, I love the drama, romances, yelling, back-biting, sniping and galore. Kind of a microcosm of all the drama playing out now everywhere I guess.",/review/rw7899840/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2021,m-elle-kat,6," Guilty Pleasure

1 November 2016,Dunham16,9," a charming piece of reality show fluff which rings true
",The premise is not at first enticing. A luxury yacht is for rent to wealthy charter primary bookers staffed by a so called professional crew for fiction totally untrained in any the social graces normally expected of such formal service and likely to be written by the fiction writers to clash with each other as males and females for days at a time must sleep and eat in each other's presence in very tight crew quarters. The yacht t ravels to different ports each season with a slightly differerent crew each time writing in perfectly delightful fictitious wealthy charter primaries and perfectly delightful new yachties for often interesting stories of why their ports of call have been for centuries premiere world tourist attractions. What makes this show enticing under these not always promising circumstances starts with the marvelous casting each and every on an absolute gem. ==Just take your pick because all are superbly written and superbly cast. Next is the delightful minute to minute interaction of the crew which is like any reality show what happens when not well meshed people work together under not well planned out management- certainly every episode delightful to watch for this fluff.,/review/rw7899840/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2021,jakeadam1998,7," Take it for what if it is...reality tv
","If you take this show at face value, it is an entertaining show with frequent drama and shocking moments. The crew is picked by the casting to be entertaining and unique, which most of the crew are. The guests are entertaining if not being complete a**holes most of the time.",/review/rw7899840/?ref_=tt_urv

31 July 2020,CriticFred,8," Just what the doctor ordered!
","Brilliant. I can't stop watching it. I love how you get to have an all access pass, so you can see what the charter guests are seeing and what a life of luxury they have. But also that you get to see what happens ""Below Deck"", what there going through and what romance is in the air. What I think I like about it the most is that you get to see the different sections of the crews, and that they put in what the person is saying at that moment which is always funny. I must say though I do like Kate and Ben they are so funny together, which makes it have a great vibe, especially when it gets really irate in the kitchen. Love it, watched, Brilliant.",/review/rw7899840/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2021,rscott25,7," As I watch it more....
","I seriously wonder who screens these people. Is it strictly for drama, or some semblance of seamanship? For me, having worked in a hotel...you have an instinct of what is important. MANY of these people, from sailing, to med...seem like they have never worked in any hospitality position, much less a high end one. That includes the Chief stews and Bosuns. I can say, I would not hire a huge majority to work at the local Motel 6, much less for the richest of the world.",/review/rw7899840/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2020,coldwar-88559,3," Time to dock this crap
","I dunno but somehow I made it thru every season since the beginning hoping that things would straighten out and we would get to see what it actually takes to work on a luxury motor yacht but that is still left for the real crew of the ship while these lollies frolic and get drunk and fight each other. So after several seasons of this garbage, with each season worse than the last, I am signing off. I am embarrassed for everyone that actually works in the yachting industry. This season was just toxic. Toxic guys, toxic girls, toxic guests, and tired ass craptain. More for yall to enjoy but I am done. This is no better than Love Island or that crap. Dumb ol me for thinking that somehow this would be different than other Bravo shows at some point. Oh well. Plenty of other things to watch for 3 episodes then drop when someone enrages twitter lol.",/review/rw7899840/?ref_=tt_urv

",I don't know why the boat crew are surprised at finding or seeing coke in these guys bathroom.

",I think this show is awesome but makes me so jealous.
