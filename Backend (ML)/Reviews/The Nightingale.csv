21 January 2020,anders-n-aa-larsson,5," Did they come up with the character, before the story?
","It seems like, in The Conjuring 2, the writers just thought: ""a monster in a nun costume - that seems really cool!""
Then, when they try to build a story around it, they can't get the square peg to fit in the round hole.
It's a nun monastery in Romania. And a demon called Valak. But why is he running around in a nun costume? That story doesn't get developed enough.
A good ghost story always have a mystique and history, but this movie doesn't deliver in that aspect. Instead they seem just to rely on jump scares and cheap thrills.",/review/rw4322695/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2018,tonyjcole94,3," Very VERY VERY cliche. Lots of jump scares. Dragging plot.
","This film is OBVIOUSLY missing the James Wan touch that we loved in the conjuring universe films. Even when Wan used jump scares , it worked bc the atmosphere was tense and creepy . In ""The Nun"" they're overly planted everywhere in the movie to make up for the fact that the director couldn't keep the audience captivated any other way.",/review/rw4322695/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2018,onexmillion,7," What's with the 1 and 2 star ratings?
","I've seen a few stinkers of horrors that certainly deserve 1 or 2 starts, but come on, The Nun deserves better than that.
Sure it doesn't have the finesse of The Conjuring films, the plot is a little thin and the scares do rely quite heavily on the tried and tested loud jump scares, but:",/review/rw4322695/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2019,lewismusgrove88,3," This movie sucked.
","I wanted to like The Nun but damn this movie was garbage. Sure it was shot nicely and the acting was fine, but good grief the story was dull as dish water. Full of cheap scares and a dumb, dragging plot. The nun character was far scarier in The Conjuring movies.",/review/rw4322695/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2018,jtindahouse,5," A huge let down
","If you had told me five years ago that one of my most anticipated movies of 2018 would be titled 'The Nun' I would've been very surprised. It was though. I had been looking forward to this movie ever since it was announced. I'm a huge fan of both of 'The Conjuring' movies, but have admittedly not loved either of the two 'Annabelle' spin-offs. I was very pleased to see James Wan was attached to the writing side of things on this one though and so held out high hopes for it. Sadly though, I have to report this is another complete misfire.",/review/rw4322695/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2018,TheLittleSongbird,4," The less than creepy nun
","Have an appreciation for horror, remember really liking 'The Conjuring' films (though they need a re-watch) and liked the idea. The advertising also suggested a quite creepy film if done right. Seeing that 'The Nun' was not positively received, critically and by word of mouth, however lowered my expectations somewhat, being one of not many to have respect for critics opinions.",/review/rw4322695/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2018,robinalers,6," Not what you want it to be
","Let's begin with saying that the movie is definitely still worth the time to see. As there are a few moments where The Nun is portrayed in such a way that you do feel how great and powerful it is, and the music during these scenes (trust me, you will recognise them when you see them) is incredible. You'll feel hopeless, just as the characters at that time, but unfortunately these moments are scarce.",/review/rw4322695/?ref_=tt_urv

","In 1952, in Romania, a nun hangs herself to escape from an evil force. When the peasant Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet) finds her body, the Vatican sends the priest Burke (Demián Bichir) and the novice Irene (Taissa Farmiga) to the abbey to investigate the case.

16 September 2018,tjlisson,3," For Teenagers
","OK but ultimately run-of-the-mill horror. The budget theater I saw this flick in was filled with noisy teenagers yacking and reacting throughout, which would have been a lot worse if I really thought I was missing much. ",/review/rw4322695/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2018,Fella_shibby,8," I found it be very similar to Dark Waters (1993). This film too boasts of awesome cinematography n spooky atmosphere n
","I gave an 8 for this reason only.
In my review of Dark Waters n A Cure for Wellness, I mentioned that cinematography n atmosphere ain't enuff to save a bad film but this film ain't bad. It is well acted n directed n unlike the other two this wasn't boring at all.
Compared to the recent pg13 horror films by Warner Bros, this film has a little blood but the only bothering trend continuing in all these films (Insidious, Conjuring, Annabelle 2 n this film) is the lack of kills.
Nobody seems to die in these films apart from Annabelle 1.
People r thrown away, people r pushed against walls n pillars but they seem to survive. Of course, this film has some offscreen kills n this is one of the reason y its different from the above films.
The priest scene with the hat n bag was also similar to The Exorcist.
In the future I hope they show some good amount of blood n on screen kills in such films.",/review/rw4322695/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2018,nimdude,4," Technically decent, narratively ridiculous and unconvincing
","The Nun is another chapter in the marvel cin
... conjuring cinematic universe that for some reason keeps expanding.
The jumpscare plagued, unexplained and way too over the top plot is such a waste due to the fact that technically, this movie is the best in the conjuring universe. ",/review/rw4322695/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2018,kluseba,9," Oozing with atmosphere
","I don't care about The Conjuring series but decided to watch The Nun nonetheless because it takes place in Romania, has both religious and occult elements and is set in an old monastery surrounded by a gloomy graveyard, dense forest and isolated village. ",/review/rw4322695/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2018,blakegill,9," Definitely worth the time!
","In a time where found footage and torture porn films are considered scary it was nice to see a good old fashioned ghost story. The conjuring series is a good one and the Nun is no exception. A nice eerie tone with a couple of twists make it an instant classic. If you're a fan of the conjuring series you'll enjoy it. If you are looking for nudity and gore, maybe worth a pass.",/review/rw4322695/?ref_=tt_urv

18 April 2021,andreascaloni,6," OK
","The Nun is a spin-off of 2016's The Conjuring 2 and the fifth installment in the Conjuring Universe franchise. The plot follows a Roman Catholic priest and a nun in her novitiate as they uncover an unholy secret in 1952 Romania. The movie has great locations, some interesting ideas, good jumpscares and atmospheres, and a pretty good first half. Unfortunately the film has a bad second half with some ridicolous moments. The Nun is an entertaining movie but it isn't what i was expecting from this very creepy character of the franchise.",/review/rw4322695/?ref_=tt_urv

","Let me tell me how you'll enjoy this great movie. Even if you re a fan of old cult horror films, leave your ego outside the cinema. Don't convince your self that you won't get scared or that you won't like it. YOU WILL, after that. This movie has excellent sound effects, great soundtracks, good sensation and a lot of scare. It is a nice completed scenario from the conjuring universe and it might expand. I loved the constant scare, every few minutes we had some chills!",/review/rw4322695/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2018,Yee_Reviews,5," Horror Film for Amateurs (Teens)
","Good: The setting of an abbey helps create the dark and haunting tone of the movie. The creepy atmosphere built with dim lights and fog help set the mood. Because of the atmosphere and mood there is great suspense for the first few scares, but with too much repetition of jump scares, the tension starts to dissipate...",/review/rw4322695/?ref_=tt_urv

","I just saw the movie this weekend, at 4DX 2D, and I can tell you truthfully I had tons of fun.
