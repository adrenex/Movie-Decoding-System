14 October 2018,zack_gideon,10," Perfect
","This show is about life and death, the two conditions we all know. Personally watching this show made me cry many times. I'm a guy who never cries. This show is directed perfectly. Acting is also perfect. The mother's soul is acted in a way where I've never been so moved ever. Carla gugino is so incredible that it brought me to tears. She might be the best actress on the planet right now.",/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2018,sxxn_hotmd,10," I don't want to believe that a perfect horror series does exist. My first-ever review!
","I have never written a review before. This series undoubtedly deserves my first. I have never watched a show that is perfectly written, cast, directed, and executed. This one will always be my favorite series of all time with companies like Chernobyl, Game of Thrones, and Black Mirror.",/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2018,hlahorner,8," Outstanding Beginning, Disappointing Finish
","Creepy, gothic, atmospheric drama/horror story about a family who briefly lived in a haunted house and the far reaching effects it has on each of their lives. ",/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2018,MadMadamMolly,10," Amazing!
","I'm quite a horror junkie, and it's so rare to find such an engaging horror series. Fantastic atmosphere, the creepy bits weren't overdone so none of it seemed hokey, acting was spot on, and in the end I didn't feel cheated by the plot line (no holes or strings left dangling, I really hate when that happens). Usually I can tear apart horror movies because of inconsistencies or impractical things but I saw none when I binge watched this show. Just fantastic all around, and I really enjoyed the way it was told, the past and present and how it flowed so well. I recommend this 100%.",/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2018,ahmetkozan,9," Super creepy. Best horror I've seen in a long time.
","So, Let me start by saying I would give this show an 8.5, however, I have bumped it to a 9 as I finished the show recently, and my impressions of the last two episodes may be negatively skewing it lower.",/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2018,pnathan28,10," Damn good Horror show.
","Really well written and acted, with a good story and characters. Thos is everything AHS should have been.",/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2022,kadenkgcampbell,10," utter perfection
","Spectacular show. It is now one of my favourite shows ever. The acting, the story, the spectacle, the character development, the pace, the horror. It is truly a perfect show. I wanted to talk about everyone's character separately and explain how much they meant to me.",/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2018,zakkattackkkk,8," We need more horror like this!
","The Haunting of Hill House is HANDS DOWN the best horror series I've ever seen. It's a meditation on death, grief and trauma. It is equal parts scary and engaging. The best character development I've seen in a long time and a huge leap forward for horror. We need more horror like this. It has disturbed me and moved me. It's portrayal of the supernatural as more of a human experience and less of a ""poltergeist"" type is revolutionary. It, to me, makes more sense to believe in ghosts than I ever thought was possible",/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2022,smileyyanny97,9," As Perfect As Art Can Be
","Everything about this show was excellent in concept and execution. Writing, casting, acting, directing, cinematography ect... were great. A true tour de force of visual media. The show contains such sensible and intellectual ideas about grief and family that makes it so hopeful in the end, despite being gut-wrenching and terrifying. Although this is supernatural horror, it is well grounded in reality, even more than some ""realistic"" horror films.",/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2022,ten-thousand-marbles,9," Truly chilling, intense, beautiful and sad
","This is one of the best things I've watched in recent memory. There are times it is legitimately scary with goosebumps and all, and times it is touching and may raise a tear. It caught me quickly and kept me engaged til the end.",/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2018,davidm-14,8," reimagining of the shirley jackson book
","Unlike other reviews have indicated, this is not a sequel, prequel or remake of any of the prior film versions or the classic novel. my personal favorite is the 1963 robert wise version, ""the haunting"". scared the crap out of me as a child - the doorknobs and the bending walls. russ tamblyn from that version even makes a cameo in this version as well, playing nell's therapist.",/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2020,TheVictoriousV,9," Getting horror right by cutting deep
","With its wintry color schemes, outstanding performances (exemplifying casting that has kept both acting ability and actor-likeness in mind), and niftily nonlinear storytelling, The Haunting of Hill House adapts Shirley Jackson's gothic classic into the finest horror show of its era. Then again, as a multitude of critics have argued, the word to use might not be ""horror"" - the word is ""terror"".",/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2018,junenwaller,9," Investment in the characters is an understatement
","I don't usually invest my time in watching anything in the horror genre, as most are generally predictive and due to lack of music accompaniment I know when to cover my eyes so as not to end up on a defibrillator. The generic full of unnecessary gore and a lack of believability storyline was definitely missing from this well written and performed series. Nothing in this genre usually surprises me, but this was something very different.",/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2018,khayatrony,10," I almost cried at the end of episode one
",This is what I've been waiting for. I am a huge horror fan and a huge fun of this show. I almost cried at the end of episode one because I've been waiting for a show like this for so long. Thank you!,/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv

18 October 2018,panos0000,6," Drama not horror
",Started of great but it fell apart after the sixth episode.Too much melodrama and too many monologues ruined it.,/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2019,tulsi-das-khan,6," Overrated
","I'm not saying this show is bad. But best horror show in the history? Are you serious? First of all, it's not horror. It is pure family drama which unfortunately drags for too long. The cinematography is spot on, the acting is great but that's about it. The series blends well with the different timelines but fails to create the required tension. It was a lame attempt by Flanagan to keep the viewers hooked",/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2022,YourAnxietyIssues,10," The BEST Horror I've Ever Seen
",I literally cannot rave ENOUGH about how good Mike Flanagan is.,/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2018,jkp-309-258974,6," The last episode was bad, bad, bad.
","I don't watch many horror shows, but gave this a try. It kept me interested and there are some creepy and scary moments. I personally thought the character development was well done and the drama unfolding made me come back for more.",/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2019,JShaft33,5," Don't understand the hype
","Writing this after 6 episodes and entertaining the idea of quitting right now. I find myself utterly distracted. This is like a gothic version of this is us. Overly dramatic. Drawn out storylines and conversations. Jump scare tactics. I really wanted to like it but it just couldn't hold my interest. I found a lot of the characters insufferable. If you don't care about the family dynamics, there really is not much left.",/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2018,ken-01440,6," Strong start, weak finish.
","I want two things after a horror movie/book/mini-series, some sort of closure and an uneasy feeling walking down a dark hallway. ",/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2018,Salamalad,8," Captivating
","A series of a family that got f'd up in a haunted house, and you just want to find out why and what really went wrong. Each episode is captivating and you cant help but keep watching. horror/thriller/drama, good job netflix its always a 50/50 but this series is good",/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2022,zte1133,10," Not your average horror show
","If you like face paced jump scares then this isn't for you. Personally I find the directing and overall flow of the entire show to be perfect. Mike Flanagan is amazing, I've loved all of his work so far. This shows horror is deep, subtle at times and really connects with the fears of a child and on to adulthood. Acting was superb as well in my opinion, there was at least one character everyone could connect with. If you like horror and drama and are tired of your typical cheap jump scare movies/shows then I can't recommend this enough. I've watched it all the way through 4 times already! Give it a shot!",/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2021,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8," The rest is just confetti.
","'The Haunting Of Hill House (2018)' is more likely to cause heartbreak than a heart attack, yet it still somehow leaves you feeling uplifted in the end.",/review/rw7618654/?ref_=tt_urv
