28 July 2001,mentalcritic,10," Easily the best thing that has come out all year...
","It would be all too easy to dismiss Enemy At The Gates as being an attempt to cash in on Saving Private Ryan's success, but in my opinion, it is a very worthy competitor. In fact, it is a better film. I say that primarily because I am sick to death of Americans using World War II as a basis for films that generally amount to little more than propaganda. Of course, Enemy At The Gates comes off as being somewhat fantastic due to its attempt to balance entertainment with historical fact, and it came as a surprise to me to learn that Sergeant Vassili Zaitsev was a real person (whose sniper rifle is still an exhibit in a Russian museum), but this makes it all the more entertaining to watch.",/review/rw0973015/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2015,SnoopyStyle,8," compelling war movie
","It's the fall of 1942. Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) grew up hunting with his father in the woods. He, Tania (Rachel Weisz) and countless other untrained recruits are brought up to the front at Stalingrad. He and Commisar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) survive a suicidal charge. Vassili kills 5 Germans in the aftermath and Danilov writes about him. Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins) seizes the opportunity to make him a star. Opposing him is the aristocratic German sniper Major König (Ed Harris).",/review/rw0973015/?ref_=tt_urv

","In ""Enemy at the Gates,"" the future of the greatest battle of World War II, would be decided between a young Russian sniper and an aristocratic sharpshooter from Germany sent to kill him Jude Law and Ed Harris sit for hours waiting for the right moment It was a duel set in the siege of Stalingrad Stalingrad was one of the biggest and bloodiest battles of World War II, and in the midst of this huge battle, these two soldiers were hunting each other down ",/review/rw0973015/?ref_=tt_urv

",Bursting into my Top Five war movies of all time is this film. A gritty and realistic portrayal of one of the worst battles in the history of war - the 1942-43 armwrestle for the city of Stalingrad.,/review/rw0973015/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2003,MovieAddict2016,," There's something missing here...
","""Enemy at the Gates"" seems as if it can't make up its mind as to whether it is a brutal war epic or an affectionate character study. Both of these can work together and form a terrific movie, or they can seperate and become their own. This one's in-between. It held my interest in certain areas, but yet also left me a bit disgruntled by the way it manipulates its audience. And there's a silly love story thrown in for good measure. That does it.",/review/rw0973015/?ref_=tt_urv

21 August 2001,mhasheider,10," An extrordinary work of raw skill and imagination.
","A gut-wrenching and impressive hide-and-seek thriller that uses the bloody battle of Stalingrad (during the second World War) as the clever disguise here for a real battle of courage and determination.  The film follows a young and highly talented Russian sniper from the Urals, Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law - ""eXistenZ"", ""The Talented Mr. Ripley""), who gains national fame from the help of Danilov (Joesph Fiennes - ""Shakespeare in Love""), a propoganda officer and his true love and fellow sniper, Tania (Rachael Weisz), who is also flirting with Danilov.",/review/rw0973015/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2020,ma-cortes,7," The bloody battle of Stalingrado between two nations became a conflict between two men well played by Jude Law and Ed Harris
","The film is a love story and death set in 1942-1943 during the Battle of Stalingrad, into the six month battle that caused nearly 2,000,000 total casualties (wounded, killed, captured) for the two opponents, including hundreds of thousands of Russian civilians. Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins) arrives in Stalingrad to coordinate defense of the city and demands ideas from his subordinates on how to improve morale. Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) , a senior lieutenant, suggests that the people need ""an example, but an example to follow"" and give them hope.Danilov recommends Zaitzev. Soon after, Danilov begins publishing tales of Vasily's exploits in the army's newspaper that paint him as a national hero and propaganda icon. Vasily (Jude Law) is transferred to the sniper division and becomes friends with Danilov. Both also become romantically interested in Tania Chernova (Rachel Weisz) , a citizen of Stalingrad who has become a private in the local milit a.With the Soviet snipers taking an increasing toll on the German forces, German Major Erwin König (EdHarris) is deployed to Stalingrad to kill Vasily to crush Soviet morale. A renowned marksman and head of the German Army sniper school at Zossen, he lures Vasily into a trap and kills two of his fellow snipers, but Vasily manages to escape, but the confrontation goes on and on.

18 March 2001,sisko2374,," A selective distortion of history
","""Enemy at the Gates"" by William Craig was a great history of the Battle of Stalingrad as retold by living participants. ""War of the Rats"" was a powerful, moving dramatization of Zaitsev and the Soviet snipers who fought at Stalingrad, as well as the Germans who opposed them. I thought that the movie would be based on at least the novel. I was disgusted to find out that the producer/director/writers chose to throw both of these memorable books out the window and instead manufacture their own vision of the battle that provided absolutely no historical insight, replacing the great stories of the two books with warmed over putrid anti-communism.",/review/rw0973015/?ref_=tt_urv

7 July 2016,Leofwine_draca,8," Hugely efficient war movie, with thorough authenticity
","This effective movie has a great, epic background over which to play the story - the battle of Stalingrad in World War II, which left the city in smouldering ruins and hundreds of soldiers (on both sides) dead. Like with most modern blockbusters, the budget is big (the biggest in Europe, it has been said), and there are plenty of authentic bombing raids and gun battles in this action-packed movie which only slightly drags towards the end. CGI fighters spit bombs down on to the ruined streets and the smoke from dozens of explosions fills the sky to great effect in some truly breath-taking battle sequences. The film doesn't shy away from the violence either, preferring to show in graphic detail the sight of bullets erupting through bodies and exploding heads, blood everywhere, particularly in a disturbingly realistic scene showing enemy fire peppering a group of soldiers huddled together on a boat.",/review/rw0973015/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2002,Spleen,," Uh, guys, there's a war on
","No doubt the title is an indication of what the film would LIKE to be about. The Germans forces were indeed ""at the gates"" - they are on the verge of capturing Stalingrad, they would lay siege to Leningrad, and at one point even Moscow appeared to be in danger.  The situation was desperate.  But after we're told all this, the position of the German army turns out to have no more to do with the story than the position of the sun in the zodiac. After a bitter, violent battle over - well, we're never told - nothing of a military nature happens again.  Not even offstage.  (Until the end, when, after a brief ""offensive"" of unfathomable significance, an epilogue tells us that the Germans were repelled from after all.)  All the action in Stalingrad freezes so that we can watch a protracted duel between a Russian and a German sniper.",/review/rw0973015/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2002,Theo Robertson,7," Good Film But No Classic Epic
","I liked ENEMY AT THE GATES , but its flaws are very obvious . First of all is Rachel Weisz who makes a very unconvincing Soviet heroine with a very distracting upper class English accent , I guess this is to make the film more marketable to a potential female audience along with the inclusion of a love triangle which is slightly unnecessary and underdeveloped ( Witness the scene where it looks like Danilov is going to have the hero arrested as an enemy of the state and this is never followed up ? ) and did we really need to have the inclusion of a sex scene ? These small problems  spoil the film somewhat and stops it becoming a classic epic",/review/rw0973015/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2006,ccthemovieman-1,6," Should Have Been Much Better
","This was a pretty solid World War II story but wasn'tas good as I hoped. It's still definitely worth a look and worth collecting if you like Word War II movies. Speaking of looks, this film got panned for its cinematography by some national reviewers because it was ""too bland,"" but that was deliberate. It's a bland topography and a somber story.

24 November 2001,David-240,10," The futility of war, and what causes it.
","I really loved this film.  It is one of the best movies about war - what it is like, and what causes it.  I know some people find the love story hard to take, but it is there to illustrate how jealousy and envy can lead to irrational acts, hate, and even war.",/review/rw0973015/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2005,planktonrules,10," smart, gritty and fascinating
","I had never heard about this movie when I first saw it on television, so I really had no idea what to expect. If the movie hadn't captured my interest, I'm sure I would have changed the channel after just a few minutes. However, the sheer intensity of the opening segment where hundreds of Russian soldiers were literally thrown into the German lines practically unarmed (and with ""political officers"" behind them threatening to shoot them if they slowed at all in their advance) fascinated me. In fact, I remember barely breathing and feeling VERY tense during this segment--now that's great film making! The scene slows after nearly all these Russian troops are needlessly wasted. Remaining alive in a bunker is a political officer (Joseph Fiennes--the KGB man who enforces Stalin's mad directives and insures proper communist thinking among the soldiers) and a common soldier (Jude Law). They are pinned down and seemingly about to die. Fiennes is about to take a chance at attacking a group of five Germans--hoping to take them by surprise. He's obviously nervous and, as a political officer, probably useless when it comes to actual fighting. He asks Law if he can shot. ""A little"" is his reply--and he takes the gun. Then, like a shadow, he methodically kills all five Germans--timing his shots with incoming artillery rounds to cover the gunshots. Fiennes is absolutely amazed with the marksmanship and from then on, makes Law's character a hero of the Great Patriotic Struggle.",/review/rw0973015/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2003,bob the moo,," Very effective thriller with only a few dead spots
","When Vassili Zaitsev first arrives at the Russian front in Stalingrad, he finds himself stuck in one man's land and, before returning to his own lines, takes out five officers with one rifle.  Looking for a morale booster, Political Officer Danilov uses Vassili as a hero to spur the other men on.  However when the Germans' morale falls due to the snipers, they bring in Major Konig, an expert sniper, to hunt down and kill the Russian hero.  Thus begins a game of cat and mouse between the two men.",/review/rw0973015/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2005,AKalinoff,1," Best Described as an Insult. Used better as firewood.
","When my American friends told me about this Movie I thought I might enjoy it. After 5 minutes I did not know whether to be angry or disgusted. The battle of Stalingrad(Leningrad is modern St. Petersburg up north, Stalingrad is Volgograd in Russia's south) has never before been so knowingly destroyed and revised to demonize and smear the country that won the war in Europe, and helped to fight and defeat Japan before it attacked the US in 1938-39.",/review/rw0973015/?ref_=tt_urv

1 May 2002,andy-227,," Another prime example of why I hate Hollywood.
","""Enemy at the Gates"" may be seen by your average historian as a good war movie.  Things like ""based on a true story"" heighten it to some level of importance and integrity.  The reality of it, and many films like it, is that it's just another cliched, contrived piece of Hollywood claptrap that is neither interesting nor inspiring.  Put aside all of the hollywoodishness of the story structure and style of the movie, it fails on a geometric level to even maintain the casual viewer's interest with entertainment value. Whether this was made by a huge corporation which recycles film formulas or not, ""Enemy at the Gates"" is quite tedious.  The ""love story"" is hackneyed and unengaging because of it's own cliche.  The set-ups are never paid off with satisfactory conclusions.  The characters are uninteresting because they wallow in their own cardboard cut-outness.  This isn't even a good Hollywood movie.  In terms of style, one can sense the ""Private Ryan"" rip-offs running amok.  Huge explosions and gunshots are filmed at a similarly fast frame rate as the battle sequences in ""Saving Private Ryan"". Now, despite all of the cliches and imperfections of ""Private Ryan"", that film DID break new ground with it's style and vivid battle sequences which linger with the viewer long after the closing images.  ""Enemy at the Gates"" is just a boring, uninteresting retread of war movies and pointless love-triangles that is as much a failure to innovate as it is to captivate and entertain.  It's just another example of why I hate Hollywood and avoid it as much as I can.",/review/rw0973015/?ref_=tt_urv

","I went to see ""Enemy at the Gates"" with my husband, as I knew it was about his favorite battle of his favorite war that he watched continually on the Military Channel. After having to endure a harangue the whole way to the screen about how we would be seeing the real battle that won the war, not that inconsequential D-Day that ""Saving Private Ryan"" made such a big deal about as the U.S. didn't come in until the Russians already had turned the tide, I asked could he please be quiet during the movie and refrain from commenting on inaccuracies, etc. until after.

17 June 2001,WalterFrith,," A good cat and mouse game.
","Ed Harris (the Nazi) and Jude Law (the Russian) are matched against each other as World War II snipers serving their countries.  Joseph Fiennes is also good in a pivotal role as is Bob Hoskins as Nikita Khrushchev and Rachel Weisz as a strong female character.  This is a compelling look at the constantly needed reminder that simply, war is terrible and the innocent victims that suffer is even more tragic.  Director Jean-Jacques Annaud's still framed direction has always lacked a depth of character development but he still makes admirable films for the high end lovers of film art.",/review/rw0973015/?ref_=tt_urv
