12 September 2005,dphelan-1,," Riveting and touching with great stories and performances
","I starting watching COLD CASE while in a hotel room at a conference. When I returned home I found that my wife had also begin watching the very same episode. So we started making it our regular Sunday viewing. It is in a word - fantastic! The mood, the music, the actors, the back stories and the weird plots draw you in each week. In addition they work in themes that are important but they never beat you over the head with them. So far i have seen stories on the ease of getting guns and how they harm society, child abuse, pedophiles, and racism. But I never feel I am being preached to. The episode about the little boy sold into sexual slavery by his uncle and the tragic way this evil pedophile ruined his and others lives will stay with me forever. It was very heartbreaking. The opening credits and the great music by ES Posthumus ( as well as the songs that set the time, place and mood throughout the episodes) are eerie and evocative and just wonderful. I love this show.",/review/rw1799375/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2019,monberger,10," The music is a fantastic strategy for this show!
",I want to say that the music played an important role for the high ratings this show got. I personally love it! I think is the kind a show you will want to see reruns now and then. It is very emotional and pulls you in to the memories. It is really too bad that never was released on DVD and much the less on Blu-ray. I believed there is an issue with music copyrights. My hope is that the network and music studios get on some kind of an agreement and decide to release this great show. I know it's all about money.,/review/rw1799375/?ref_=tt_urv

","I found that I absolutely love this show way too late apparently. I have been checking on all steaming access for several years now and cannot find a place to watch it. I never have had the opportunity to see them all therefore certainly not in order. I am a out of the closet, unashamed binge watcher. I want to see them all. Someone please add it to a streaming format.",/review/rw1799375/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2019,ma-cortes,7," Nostalgic and sensitive series about a Philadelphia investigation squad assigned to investigate cold cases committed many years ago
","Good show, nice series formed by 156 episodes, 7 seasons ,about an expert force at law, a professional squad of homicides, Philadelphia set, taking on cold cases, bringing them to life . Being starred by lone female detective Lilly, Kathryn Morris, who finds her calling when is assigned by her superior boss John Stilman : John Finn, to investigate criminal ""Cold Cases"" , older crimes that have ever been solved and working for Philadelphia Department . They must attempt to re-think the killing scenes and interview other people involved with the victims to find out a link to solve the criminal cases executed many years earlier. At their hard work they suffer risked incidents, at times, and dangerous situations that from time to time put them on the verge of nervous breakdown. It is well paced by using flashbacks, including nostalgic songs from the 60, 70s, 80s, 90s... Homicide is timeless but detection methods change. Hope lives, because the evidence never dies. Better late than never.",/review/rw1799375/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2003,4-Kane,," The best new dramatic series of 2003
","A few years ago, I remember hearing stories about actual cold case squads, and how they successfully solved cases that went unsolved for many years. I was so intrigued by such stories that it soon occurred to me that it would be cool if there were a TV series involving characters solving unsolved crimes. To my knowledge, there wasn't one. But that has finally changed, thanks to this clever new show.",/review/rw1799375/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2005,bjobrei,," best TV show for years
","This is brilliant ! In a time where ""best shows""are simply physically exhausting to watch-this is a revelation. Each episode leaves you in deep thought-and you get insight in the feelings of both victim and criminal. And indeed others involved. Some wonderful touches, like ""then and now"" footage adds to the brilliance. I am still young myself (well, ok...31..) but I dislike the mtv-style of filming in many American series. Cold case gives you an opportunity to think for yourself, unlike an other popular show- where a hero with one facial expression saves the world from the bad guys over and over again. I will not name this show-seems I am the only one hating it:) But-cold case-yes, bravo. More of this please !",/review/rw1799375/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2005,skoyles,," Canada 7.5, USA 10
","First there was ""Cold Squad"" set in Vancouver masquerading as.... Vancouver! Now while Vancouver is only barely Canadian it was refreshing to see a Canadian-made show set in Canada rather than New York having Vancouver's Coast Range mountains in the background as in one infamous example in a Jackie Chan movie. (I bet all those people in Brooklyn and Harlem enjoy the snow-capped peaks they can see from Manhatten.) ""Cold Squad"" was a reasonably good police procedural and worth a look.",/review/rw1799375/?ref_=tt_urv

8 September 2005,Stibbert,," Give these cold ones a warm welcome!
","I'm glad I got the opportunity to catch this show. It's no doubt one of the really good shows on TV these days. Cold Case follows homicide detective Lilly Rush of the Philadelphia police as she digs up the ""cold cases"". Old unsolved crimes.",/review/rw1799375/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2020,m-47826,8," Near perfection crime drama.
","If it wasn't for some cases silly conclusions, the show would get a better rating. Obviously, the best part are the flashbacks. Taking us back to different years/decades, and the soundtrack that goes with it. But the soap is good too and gives the series a new appeal, when investigators private lives get just as messy as their « cold cases » victims. I doubt the show will ever get a DVD or VOD release, because of the music copyright issues. And I refuse to watch it without the original soundtrack, that is a character on its own. So I hope channels will keep rerunning it, because it's really good. And my personal favorite.",/review/rw1799375/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2017,snowyprecipice,10," Stellar work of art
","I've watched almost every 'mainstream' crime show out there and Cold Case is definitely in my top five. The use of music, the plots, the characters... they're all amazing. Maybe I'm a bit biased because I'm an oldies-but-goodies fan, but some of the songs, along with the scenes, brought tears to my eyes. The plots are good, some are even brilliant, and I was riveted for 90% of the episodes. The ease with which scenes from the present transit with scenes from the past really gave this show its unique flavour/catch. Especially at the end, when they show the present people (victim's families, friends etc) the way they were in the past.",/review/rw1799375/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2004,danikka1,," Best Show on T.V.
",I didn't get into Cold Case until half way through the first season but I LOVE it! It has quickly become my first choice when I turn on the TiVo - surpassing all the Law & Orders and Without a Trace..... I found the use of music to bring you back to whatever era the crime was committed to be terribly effective and the last few minutes of each episode are haunting.,/review/rw1799375/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2017,OllieSuave-007,8," A good 2000s mystery drama!
","This is one the only mystery/crime drama I saw during the 2000s, and it was pretty good for what it was. It starred Kathryn Morris as Detective Lily Rush, whom took on the task of solving cold cases at the Philadelphia Police Department.",/review/rw1799375/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2004,Dani-62,," Never ceases to amaze me
","""Cold Case"" features fictional cases that have been unsolved for years. The stories are touching, even though we know these situations are not real. The show never ceases to amaze me and touch me in ways most television shows cannot.  Somehow it seeps under your skin because you know thousands of people in the real world live with the things that go on in the episodes. Kathryn Morris gives  a stellar performance each week and always has the audience rooting for her to kick some butt.  The editing is unique, as well, and I think the strongest tactic the show uses is how they always wrap up the case and the episode by arresting the person as they are now, but never failing to cut to show what they would look like if they had gotten arrested when they first committed the crime.  The victim almost always appears vindicated at the end.  This of course works  best when they go  back to cases some ten or more years earlier. This is a new show, and it has certainly broken out of the mold.  It is not just another formulaic crime drama.  The fact that each episode is about the individual case and not the saga of the detectives makes it easy to tune it at any time and get heavily involved.  CBS has done it again - their demographic is no longer just middle aged middle class individuals.  With shows like this they are proving they can reach a wider, savvier audience.  Jerry Bruckheimer is back on top to stay,",/review/rw1799375/?ref_=tt_urv

","Cold case is a great comfort show: it's repetitive and predictable but in a good way, the cases are mostly interesting, and the detectives take up just the right space.

","I totally loved this series when it was on television network. The cast, storylines, drama will draw you in from the beginning to end. I'm starting to rewatch the series on HBO Max. I really wish they would bring the cast back together and create a spin-off of the show. I would love to see them all working together again.",/review/rw1799375/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2008,drystyx,8," Takes you on a journey
","That sounds better than ""takes you for a ride"", because I mean this in a good way. This is probably the only crime show on TV with any credibility and creativity. Indeed, the cases usually start out giving you the feeling of ""No, I've seen this before."" But the writing makes this a journey, which takes you on a trip you don't expect. The clues are given in such a way that you follow along with the cast. Character development is stronger here than any crime show on, hands down. That may not mean a lot to you on the surface, but believe me, when you watch a show, it does make a difference. It's usually why you think a show is entertaining. You do care about these people. It may be a bit melodramatic, but murder should evoke that emotion. This show earns the right to be ""mushy"" at times (which the end usually is, but as I said, this show earns the right to be so.) I think I described this show very well. If you want to watch a crime show that isn't mundane and predictable, this is the one. Thumbs up from a hard to please critic.",/review/rw1799375/?ref_=tt_urv
