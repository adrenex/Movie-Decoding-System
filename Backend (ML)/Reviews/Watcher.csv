","French horror has been pushing the boundaries for some time now. First there was Haute Tension, then A l'Intérieur and newest in line is Martyrs, hyped up to take it all a little further. And it did, it definitely did. It's just that it doesn't belong in the same list as the films mentioned before. Martyrs goes way beyond.",/review/rw5052229/?ref_=tt_urv

5 May 2009,Coventry,10," Experience the Pain!
","I often wonder how much further the horror genre can and will evolve in terms of sadism and the portrayal of ultra-explicit violence. Especially the youngest generation of French directors appear to be involved in some sort of sport competition where each one aspires to surpass the other when it comes to showing sheer brutality and stomach-churning sickness. ""High Tension"", released in 2003, was quite extreme already, but since then there came ""Them"", ""Frontier(s)"" and ""Inside"" and each separate film raised the bar every time. Now, after experiencing the nearly indescribable intensity level of ""Martyrs"", I sincerely hope that no other movie will ever go beyond the standards set in this film. ""Martyrs"" genuinely is an astonishing and jaw-dropping ordeal that is guaranteed to leave even the most hardened and trained horror buffs speechless. From what I gathered reading reviews and listening to opinions left and right, I already knew this wasn't going to be picnic, but the truth is that absolutely nothing can prepare you for what you are about to see in ""Martyrs"". It may sound a little fantastic, but the infamous and supposedly nauseating torture porn titles such as ""Saw"", ""Hostel"" and ""Murder-Set-Pieces"" look like sophomoric episodes of Sesame Street in comparison with the recent stream of French shock-features and in particular with ""Martyrs"".",/review/rw5052229/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2008,sinnerofcinema,10," almost banned in France due to it's haunting brutality, This is the kind of film nightmares are made of
","Making its Stateside debut, Pascal Laugier's ""Martyrs"" was the grand finale to a spectacular constellation of fine horror films. ""Martyrs"" however, is not like a ""SAW"" or ""HOSTEL"" in which there are creative forms of torture served for your viewing pleasure, this film has an art house feel to it that leads into the bowels of depravity. It's demonstrates how evil man can be for the share pleasure of scientific research. It reminded me of a brochure that I received depicting the horrors of how animals are slaughtered for human consumption. If that is a brochure you'd rather not digest before dinner, ""Martyrs"" is the type of film you may not want to view on a full stomach. Brilliantly executed in ways better described only as experimental, Pascal Laugier takes us to the end of the tunnel, the last stop, to a place where there is no longer any separation between humans and animals, predators or prey, it' a place so dark, you will no longer have to imagine for now it has been recorded on celluloid. All the ""SAW"" or ""HOSTEL"" or any other torture porn created to date has nothing on ""Martyrs"". Why? Because they French know their cinema business like no other. They leave nothing up to the imagination and nothing is too taboo for them whereas here in America, filmmakers tend to like to draw certain lines when it comes to making horror films for shock value. ""Martyrs"" is one of the few crossover films that could play at a horror film festival, as well as a intellectually artsy festival or a gay & lesbian festival alike. It covers the gamut in storytelling and that is what makes this film so powerful and so inherently haunting ,it will carve many putrid memories in your phsyque long after viewing. I would not recommend this film to folks with weak stomachs.",/review/rw5052229/?ref_=tt_urv

29 September 2012,MrGKB,5," The real martyrs would appear to be the audience...
","...and what we're ultimately allowed to witness is, at its core, some pretty empty-headed, although visceral, existentially sadistic nonsense. Nonetheless, I can't deny that ""Martyrs"" packs a punch (several of them, in fact, to the face and gut, repeatedly, to its protagonist, after fooling us about who the real protagonist is). It's ultra-violence that Alex and his droogies would lap up like synthemesc milk-plus; presumably the audience is meant to as well. Aha, but auteur Pascal ""The Tall Man"" Laugier isn't through with us yet! After rubbing our collective noses in viscous pools of vengeance and hallucinatory blood guilt, he dials up the sadism a few more notches with a tiresome third act that trucks in absurdist fantasies of an elite cabal searching for proof of an afterlife through the inducement of a tortured martyr's vision of what can only be feebly represented by a coruscating white light.",/review/rw5052229/?ref_=tt_urv

","I watched this movie, because I enjoyed the director's ""Tall Man"". Someone reviewing that film mentioned this one, saying, that it contained social comment, as did ""Tall Man"". The first part of this movie seemed gritty and quite realistic, and I could empathize with the characters, who were abused children. The second part of the movie (it has three distinct parts) begins with a shocking scene, which I felt totally morally bankrupted the film, as the abused girl kills children, the children of her abusers. Maybe it's just me, but I have a hard time believing someone tortured as a child and still in great pain from it, would coldly murder other children. In any case, this second section is more standard ""horror movie"" fare, and I lost my empathy for the main character, as an abused child. The second main character alone survives until the third section. Here she is accosted and tortured graphically for a long period of time. At this point, as I did with ""Funny Games"", I'm asking myself, ""Why are the film-makers showing me this?"" I am not entertained by watching people suffer, unless there is some redeeming, meaningful reason for showing this. Unfortunately, I could not find one here. A gang of insane, old, rich, white people babbling some quasi-metaphysical nonsense AIN'T a reason. Crazy people will commit any manner of atrocity, but it won't make any sense and I don't need to watch it. Thank God, this director got a little more realistic for his next feature. If you want to show children being tortured, you better have a hell of a good reason for it. The last two thirds of this film just left me empty. Amazingly, I didn't even feel for the girl, who gets tortured in the last third. That's how meaningless this scene was. I saw a reason why Hanaeke was showing me pain in ""Funny Games"" (that I, as an audience member was a voyeur) and Noe's ""Irreversible"", showed me the truly sickening nature of real, out-of-control violence. I felt the violence in those films was justified. Here, I could find no justification.",/review/rw5052229/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2008,dschmeding,7," Whats wrong with the French??
","It seems like every year you get a new french movie that the horror community talks anxious about mainly because of its boundary breaking shocks. After last years direct hit to the head ""A l'interior"" and the to me rather weak ""Frontieres"" this year its ""Martyrs"" which is supposed to raise the bar another bit and i start to wonder what makes the french go that berserk and over the top lately.",/review/rw5052229/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2008,rogergeorge,9," Brave, brilliant, brutal...
","Having missed the opportunity to catch this at the Midnight Madness showing in TIFF08, I decided to go against all stated horror movie rules and watched this today around midday at a complex in downtown Toronto.. It's difficult to know what to say about this movie really; like a birth or a death, you really have to experience it yourself and draw your own conclusions. What I will say is that as a committed horror freak, rare is the occasion when I tense up and watch a film contorted, somehow trying to protect myself from what I'm putting myself through.. It contains enough tough to see horror/gore to satisfy the bloodhounds (though it doesn't feel like another attempt to up the gore ante for the sake of it, thankfully) and then - if you can watch it and many couldn't - transcends the genre totally with a jaw-dropping final act which if you're interested in the human condition and the capacity for seemingly normal people to do incredibly bad things will have you asking questions for some time to come and recognising that when horror and ideas mesh successfully, the result can be breathtaking. Absolutely not enjoyable but there again if you go to see a horror flick at a film festival and you know beforehand that it originally received an X-certificate in France, kicking up an almighty stink in the process - well, you know that an open mind is the least you can bring to bear. With that in mind I would recommend Martyrs as a film of incredible tension, harrowing physical violence and indelible imagery; unsurprisingly, the director name-checked Dario Argento during the Q&A as a major influence in his youth and there is a clear and confident signature in the work which suggests some parallels can be made between the two film-makers. I loved this movie and for those who have already posted comments good, bad or indifferent (and I really can't imagine a neutral response!) I hope like myself you have come away with a genuine sense of having seen something the like of which we are unlikely to see for some time..",/review/rw5052229/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2008,dante_leebo,7," Disturbing
","The film was introduced by the film's writer director Pascal Laugier at this year's Frightfest in London. The organiser's referred to the film as ""The film they most wanted"" of the 28 shown at the festival. It was easy to see why. Of all the films I saw at this year's Frightfest, Martyrs was not my favourite but without a doubt it is the one that plays on my mind the most. The film has been compared to both Hostel and Hellraiser but I think it has a lot more substance than both of those films. The central performances are top notch and Jessie Pham as the young Lucie is very convincing, completely holding your attention. So why only 7 out of 10? As well made as this film is, the subject matter is just so utterly disturbing I wanted this film to end a long time before it actually did. It is not a film that is to be enjoyed. It is not the escapism that you may be looking for. The first Act is a revenge story on a family who may or may not have been responsible for the kidnapping and torture of a young girl 15 years previously. It is the second Act though that is the more disturbing. The viewer wants it to end almost as much as the girl captured wants her ordeal to end. This is a must-see movie but certainly one that is going to divide audiences right down the middle.",/review/rw5052229/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2016,Tweetienator,5," Whole Premise Dumb Beyond Belief
","Well lots of reviews so I don't write too much about the story. Imo the best part of Martyrs is the first half but after revealing of the ""truth"" behind all the torturing this movie got in my eyes some kind of comical. I mean the whole purpose/premise of torturing someone to transcendent him... Any neurologist or doctor could tell u what will happen after someone has to endure too much physically/psychological pain/trauma, and it certainly has nothing to do with the afterlife or other dimensions or what-ever, (you get a good shot of endorphines and maybe some dissociation etc.) So watching the beatings etc. I was the whole time asking myself in the 2nd part of that movie how so many people (a cult or whatever, looked like rich old ppl afraid of death and their servants or whatever) can be so dumb to believe they could get a insight of the life after death by torturing someone. The ""solution"" of this movie really sucks. So whats left!? A good slasher in the first half with some drama, after that we see something like Mel Gibsons The Passion of Christ. If I compare the torture scenes I got to say that The Passion of Christ is far far better - it got me far more emotionally involved (the pain of the mother watching her son being whipped etc). The torture scenes of Martyrs are in the given context some kind of a miss-kick - the motivation behind it is so unbelievable that I didn't get in any kind of sense emotionally involved. What I also don't understand is why the girl didn't try to strangle one of the captors with the chains - long enough they are. So what's left!? The actors did well (ofc a minus for me is all the French emotional tantrum), the camera works also fine. Verdict: not really bad but in no way a cinematic triumph or must-see.",/review/rw5052229/?ref_=tt_urv

","Only for torture movie fans. It says ""horror, mystery, drama"", but it would be an insult for horror and mystery genres. Drama... yes, it is, and an extremely sick one too.

","OK I managed to watch this for the sake of completeness around 12 years after it was made. It lives up to the hype as far as brutal torture is concerned but I seriously thought all this mean freak show had at least some sort of plot. This is not true for Martyrs, as it is a continuous and mean-spirited assault on the senses with only purpose to shock. To tell the truth I got past this kind of cinema (if we could call it that) more than 20 years ago so the shocks are not so shocking for me anymore. What's truly shocking is the high rating this got on IMDb, which unfortunately is not surprising given what is considered as ""horror"" nowadays. Martyrs is clearly not horror, just an offensive freak show labeled as horror while it is just porn with the torture and brutal gore replacing the sex.",/review/rw5052229/?ref_=tt_urv

10 August 2019,Beard_Of_Serpico,1," Extreme but feels pointless.
","Martyrs is a French horror movie which is part of the ""new wave of french extremity"" which means it's extremely dark, gory and disturbing.
You're not supposed to have a good time watching this movie and i know that's the point but the whole thing just felt so shallow and pointless to me.
The second half of the movie is pretty much a woman being beaten to within an inch of her life and tortured. No story, interesting dialogue or characters just a girl being punched, kicked and mutilated over and over again.
All of this torture is for zero payoff, the ending is one of the dumbest things i've ever seen and it actually made me mad watching it.
I have no problem with movie gore and violence, a lot of my favourite movies are violent but this was just garbage.
