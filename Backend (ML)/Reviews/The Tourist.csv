28 December 2013,ctyankee1,," Disappointing
","It starts off with two women, Regan and Alvirah arguing about going into a detective business right from the beginning before you even know who they are. They are both friends and will be going on a a Mystery Cruise. ",/review/rw8177808/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2017,P3n-E-W1s3,4," An Average TV Murder Thriller
","This made for TV movie had the potential to much better than it turned out as it was based on Santa Cruise By Carol & Mary Higgins Clark. Unfortunately, the film suffers from everything.",/review/rw8177808/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2021,athompsonblue,6," Cute but Incomplete
","The beginning was confusing. I had to check IMDB to see if this wasn't a sequel to something else. The movie should have given more clarification on who these two women and their husbands are, and Reilly's relationship with her novelist mother.",/review/rw8177808/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2021,tiffanytallent1981,5," Like Clue on a Cruise Ship
","If you enjoy murder mysteries, you'll enjoy this movie. It does tend to move at a slow pace at times, as well as jump around to numerous characters. It's hard to keep track of what's going on or who people are, unless you pay attention. Especially since the characters are actually playing characters within the game. Lol This movie felt like it should've been a mini series instead. I think it would've worked a lot better and allowed the audience to better know the characters. Plus, we would've been able to see more mysteries solved by the best friend duo.",/review/rw8177808/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2021,jewelch,4," not as good as I had hoped
","Well I have to say this was not as good as I had hoped it would be but I did watch it all the way through and never thought i regretted this. you deside , watch or not. James Welch Henderson, Arkansas 2/21/2021",/review/rw8177808/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2020,ptnana-34392,3," NOT ACCORDING TO THE BOOK.
","This was a total disappointment from the book. Alvirah Meehan is a 60 year old woman who spent most of her life working as a cleaning lady, not some 25 year old married to a 60 year old. The book and characters was definitely not the same as the movies and thus a GREAT disappointment. If you can't stick closely to the book, don't make the movie.",/review/rw8177808/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2022,debchadwick,," Casting -- wrong!
","All you have to do is watch ""Deck the Halls"" and the casting for that movie. Scottie Thompson (Regan), Kathy Najimy (Alvirah), Larry Miller (Willie), David Selby (Luke), Jane Alexander (Nora), etc. The actors in this movie just seem miscast to me but that is only my opinion.",/review/rw8177808/?ref_=tt_urv
