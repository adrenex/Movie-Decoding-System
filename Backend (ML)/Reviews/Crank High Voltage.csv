18 April 2009,terrencepatrix,8," In short, I liked it.
","Let me start off by defending my rating of this title. Really it's hard for me to rate a movie like this, it is directed right at me and my type of people. I can't help it that I like a movie like this, it's just the way it is.",/review/rw2127319/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2009,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,8," ""Crank: High Voltage"" is one of the most over-the-top and ridiculously entertaining films of the past 10 years! It's an adult version of ""Looney Toons"" and a worthy sequel!

15 June 2010,Matt_Layden,6," Crank 2 Is Off The Wall Insanity.
","After surviving a fall from a helicopter, Chev Chelios is kidnapped directly from the spot he landed in and is taken to a place where they remove his heart. He is given an artificial one that requires an electrical charge to keep running, every hour or so. Now Chelios is on the run trying to find his old heart and to keep charged.

17 April 2009,DelBongo,7," Where Is My Strawberry Tart?
","Crank 2: High Voltage practically begs to be passionately loathed by absolutely everyone, with the notable exception of antisocial teenage boys. Its rank, nihilistic tone is relentless and exhausting. The misogyny is benchmark horrendous. The acts of violence are brutal, frequent and often blatantly homoerotic. Its flippant. Its homophobic. Its vulgar. And it feels as much seething contempt for its own narrative coherence as it does for its few prominent female characters.",/review/rw2127319/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2012,nerdomatic10-937-667230,7," Extremely intelligent mindless action flick
","Quite possibly the silliest movie ever made. I'm pretty sure these guys set out to make the ultimate mindless action flick and they succeeded brilliantly IMO. I've never seen anything like it before. IMDb claims the budget was $20M, although that seems like quite a stretch. But there is about $1B worth of craziness in it. The makers didn't hold anything back - no restraint whatsoever and it's amazing. Anyone looking to be offended will be. Guaranteed. I've heard of people walking out of movies but this is the first time I ever saw it happen. I wonder if they asked for their $$$ back. I'm pretty sure the theaters are covered from giving refunds; there's fine print on the tix or something.",/review/rw2127319/?ref_=tt_urv

16 April 2009,Quinoa1984,7," where's the heart.... I don't mean the movie, I mean the actual heart?
","For those of us that saw the first movie Crank it seemed open and shut - a retooling of D.O.A. and Speed to combine a exploitation-action-comedy that had Jason Statham gunning after the dirty folks who slipped him a irreversible Chinese poison that would kill him immediately unless he kept his heart racing like a coke-driven locomotive. At the end it seemed especially the case since, well, Chev Chelios falls out of a helicopter and crashes on a car. Dead? Actually no, as case turns out to be.",/review/rw2127319/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2009,warthogjump,8," absolute INSANITY!
","Crank 2 screams insanity from the word go. It yells ""bullshit"" left, right and centre. The things that happen in this film are extremely far-fetched and anybody chasing a 'realistic' movie will be disappointed.",/review/rw2127319/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2009,akumous,10," Absolutely INSANE!!

24 March 2017,Uriah43,2," A Bad Sequel
","This movie takes up where its predecessor left off with a mob hit-man named ""Chev Chelios"" (Jason Statham) falling from a helicopter at a high altitude and crashing onto a street somewhere in Los Angeles. Then, seconds after hitting the ground, a van pulls up and quickly puts his body inside before driving off. He soon wakes up to find that his heart has been replaced with an electrical device and that the rest of his organs are about to be harvested as well. Naturally, he doesn't quite like that idea and escapes to find the man responsible--and possibly regain his own heart in the process. Now as far as this movie is concerned I must confess that I wasn't particularly impressed with its predecessor which I believed had a great deal of unrealized potential. Because of that I rated it as about average. This movie, however, also had some of the same characteristics of the first but unfortunately it was the bad similarities that predominated. To be more specific, anything other than profanity and mindless action was essentially thrown out the window to make room for more profanity and action. In short, other than possibly the performance of Bai Ling (as a prostitute named ""Ria"") there really wasn't anything interesting about this film. And even then she was just as foul-mouthed as everybody else. Regardless, I thought that this movie was pretty bad and I have rated it accordingly.",/review/rw2127319/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2009,TxMike,," Nude, crude, profane, funny and non-stop, over-the-top action.
","I generally find loud, crude movies with pervasive filthy language very unentertaining. But this one is so funny, and so over-the-top, that it is hard to dislike it. I found myself marveling at the creativity of the writers and directors to find new and interesting ways to move the story forward.",/review/rw2127319/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2009,michaelRokeefe,7," High voltage is an understatement.
","Frantic and explosive. High octane action as the manic hit-man Chev Chelios(Jason Stratham)basically picks up where he left off the first time, but this time out he is chasing a Chinese gangster, who has hijacked his nearly indestructible heart and replaced it with a battery-powered artificial one. The deeper Chelios gets into the challenge of finding his heart, he discovers it is in the chest of a 100 yr old gang patriarch Poon Dong(David Carradine). Chev's girlfriend Eve(Amy Smart)is part of the action...and I do mean action; sex in motion. For moral support, his physician Doc Miles(Dwight Yoakam)is always a phone call away with advice on how to keep the plastic heart pumping to keep the mean caffeinated fighting machine running. Getting in on the real rough stuff are Mexican mobsters, boycotting porn stars, strippers with automatic weapons and even the LAPD.",/review/rw2127319/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2009,bundyboy_4,10," Insane Movie
","This is without a doubt one of the most insane films I have ever seen. I loved the first film and have been looking forward to the sequel. This one blows the mad-o-meter off the chart. I read on here somewhere Jason Statham was quoted saying something like. ""You ain't ever gonna get an Academy Award for doing Crank"" Well I beg to differ; I think an award category should be created for making a film like this. It has similarities to the first film of course but that's what makes this film so enjoyable. Jason is superb as Chev Chelios again and had me laughing my ass off with his cockney slang and his superb stunts. One thing I will say, I took my wife with me to see this and all the way through the film she had that ""Could this get anymore ridiculous"" look on her face. Meanwhile I couldn't stop laughing at the fact that the more outrageous this film got, the more I found myself loving it. You know when they say ""A roller-coaster ride of a movie"". Well on this roller-coaster ride you ain't strapped into your seat, it has dozens of loops and it's faster than anything you have ridden in your life. You need to see this film. In fact scrub that, I will say thisCrank 2 falls into the ""Things to do before you die"" category. Go and see this now.",/review/rw2127319/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2009,basrutten,1," Sets a new low for the ""soulless action movie"" genre
","I have to admit I actually liked the first ""Crank"" movie. Sure, it was silly and cheap, but it was also fresh and a lot of fun. ""Crank: High Voltage"" (CHV) however, shows that more is not always better.",/review/rw2127319/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2009,madmarek,1," Total and utter rubbish

22 April 2009,Ric-7,2," Very disappointing
","If you have not seen the first ""Crank,"" you may enjoy this as simply an extremely gross action film. I saw the first film, and gave it 9/10. This film is barely a 2.",/review/rw2127319/?ref_=tt_urv

3 May 2009,doppleganger19692,2," Only for testosterone-inflamed young males
","If you are a male between the ages of 15 and 25, and your idea of great entertainment is close-ups of nude females combined with bloody shootouts, Dramamine-inducing super shaky camera shots, rapid-fire choppy editing, a dialogue consisting entirely of every possible use of ""f--k"", and unnecessary gore, then this is your ""Citizen Kane"". Anybody not in the previous category should probably avoid this film. The only redeeming factors are the over-the-top and totally in-your-face incidents of humor (though too few and too far apart), and Dwight Yokum. Amazingly, there was a couple in the theater (they, along with us and one other person made up the entire viewing audience; six!) who brought their very young son to this film. When he is older, and spends every day in detention from being psychologically scarred from viewing a film like this at such a young age, I hope his parents admit their role in his warped upbringing.",/review/rw2127319/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2009,psheehanuk,1," Terrible, Awful, Horrible
","I really enjoyed Crank 1. Despite being a bit over the top, the story was pretty solid and the pace was excellent. Crank 2 is one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. The story is terrible, the acting is awful, and even the action is lame. There's one scene where they don't even fight and replace it with some kind of dodgy animation. Very poor indeed. It looks as if it were written by a chimp and a porn star - no brain power required There are some funny moments, but not enough to redeem this film. What's next, Crank 3 where he's dressed as a mummy (you'll understand). Only a idiot would like this film. Seems to be plenty of them out there. There are thousands of good scripts out there, so why did they make this in to a film. Shame on Hollywood!",/review/rw2127319/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2009,thinker1691,9," "" If you died once, chances are you will find the second time easier ""
","From the moment you began to see this film, be prepared to take a long two hour roller coaster ride filled with excitement and pure adrenaline. The character Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) is back. How? We don't know, but the fact is, he is and far more lethal than ever. Discovering himself on the operating table and about to be castrated may have been the impetus to awaken him. Now his desperate mission is to search for the elusive Johnny Vang (Art Hsu) who has his missing heart. In this second addition to the first installment of 'Crank', this supplemental film is called "" Crank, High Voltage."" In addition to searching for his heart, Chelios is hindered by an old enemies list which seems to be without end. Even though the film throws everything at the audience, it further morphs into a Japanese rendition of Godzilla vs King Kong. Excitement and physical action proliferate the movie screen and includes the return of his friend Dwight Yoakam as Doc Miles and the late David Carradine as Poon Dong. This is a good film for Statham fans which leaves little to the imagination. ****",/review/rw2127319/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2009,siderite,8," No apologies fun. Squared.
","I've wanted to see the movie for a long time now, meanwhile listening to people complaining about how unrealistic it was. Right! Like the first Crank was totally real. Just because most folks know more about electricity and high speed impacts than blood chemistry doesn't make the sequel any less fun. Unrealistic! Hell, yeah!",/review/rw2127319/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2009,SebaZava,6," It's beyond exaggeration
","Crank: High Voltage is one of the most insane, hyper-active, over-the-top, frenetic and crazy motion pictures I have ever seen. It is a video game with flesh-and-blood actors, a cartoon come alive. It is so over-the-top in fact, even more so than its predecessor, that it threatens to abandon Earth and exist in a totally different plane. You either like it or don't like it - I can see a lot of people being offended by the film, and that's not only because of its violent nature. There is everything - violence, sex, nudity, gore, language, crazy dialogue... it is not a movie for everyone. Me? I guess I liked it, - not as much as the first installment, mind you - but I think it was sometimes was too much. A film this crazy can eventually tire the viewer - it's no wonder, therefore, that it's a mere 85 minutes long.",/review/rw2127319/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," It's good movie to watch
","A pretty violent film with not much of a storyline, apart from a heart. The whole film was basically clips of action sequences which didn't add anything to the film apart from some of the 'better' scenes. It was all over the top and exaggerated to the max, with preposterous action scenes where he was not harmed at all, to loony jumping off buildings. It wasn't one of Jason's best films.",/review/rw2127319/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2011,g-bodyl,7," Good, But Not Great!
","I don't know why they had to make Crank 2. I think Crank was good enough on it's own. When I saw that this was coming out, I had no intentions to see it. Well obviously I did see it because I'm writing a review. This is actually not bad. It's not great either but this is a good B-movie.",/review/rw2127319/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2009,lastliberal,8," Maybe long time.He die hard with a vengeance.
