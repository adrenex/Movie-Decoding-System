10 July 2020,AngelHonesty,5," Hard to enjoy
","I enjoyed the books. I know that no movie or show based off of books are nearly as good, so I will not rate this compared to the books, but as a stand alone show.",/review/rw4166170/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2018,basoirbans,10," From guilty pleasure to shameless obsession!
","The most important thing I want everyone to know is that it get's better. Much better.
If you love the genre, I recommend you watch through the first season as the second season is better and the third season is totally awesome.
There are many likeable actors/actresses. The acting is believable.
The special effects get noticeably better by the season.
I absolutely LOVE the story. This is my favorite genre and I'm glad I watched through the first season even though I wasn't to eager to finish it.",/review/rw4166170/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2016,jokiko-59457,10," Shadowhunters: from ZERO to HERO
","I've been a fan of the books years before the TV show started, so I had high expectations. But I also saw enough book to TV adaptations to know what expectations were realistic. Did Shadowhunters blow me away? No, but it did manage to pull me in, very slowly. The show begins with a lot of potential but also with a lot of issues. It's cheesy, the acting was a bit off for some of the actors, it doesn't have the best special effects and the script lacks here and there. And yet I didn't give up on it and I'm so glad I didn't.",/review/rw4166170/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2020,tradairn,1," Split Personality
","I'v been reading the reviews and I'm glad to know the show improves in Season 2, but I'm on Episode 8 of Season 1 and I'm not sure I can stick with it long enough to get there.",/review/rw4166170/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2018,fjustfer-39371,8," It builds its own version.
",The new season of Shadowhunters clearly makes a stable foundation of what makes its book counterpart so intriguing. I believe this is the time where it shines and subsumes itself to the character and environment of the book that all readers are familiar of. Season 3 is the stepping stone of what could become a long running show.,/review/rw4166170/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2020,aimtrain1021,1," Poorly acted and weak script
","I am almost done with the book series, so I wanted to try the show. Looks wise the cast resembles how I picture the characters, but the acting and dialogue is so poor that it takes away from the story. I am 3 episodes in and it's so cringey. And I like these types of shows-Buffy, Supernatural, Vampire Diaries were all great shows with good casts.",/review/rw4166170/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2018,kayjordansibley,10," Just get through S1
","Get past S1 and its smooth sailing. I think it needed to find its legs and the actors needed to discover the characters more. And S2 doesn't disappoint. The cast and characters are diverse spaning across the spectrum in personality, ethnicity, and sexuality. Strong women who support each other, men who break free of the stereotypes of true masculinity, badass fight sequences (come S2)...its just good. Though it's a fantasy show, it deals with real world problems with care. The special effects and writing improve greatly in the second season. And this current third season just keeps getting better. Hoping for a season 4!!",/review/rw4166170/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2016,mr-michael-wood,4," Delivery lacking
","After the wife and I saw the movie we were disappointed to find out they weren't going to make the next in the series for the big screen. Our woe was turned to hope when we learned that it would instead be turned into a TV series. Sadly the good news stopped there. The sets look good and the story seems to be staying loyal to the book (for the most part), but the major downfall is both the acting and the special effects. The acting seems like that of your average high school drama class, lines that need pauses between them are blurted out quickly and with sloppy delivery, even the body language is lacking in any real commitment. While some of the fight scenes look good for the most part the entire feel of the acting, fighting and effects can be easily summed up as power rangers. To touch quickly on the effects, while TV shows have much smaller budgets than feature length movies I feel some effects should have been left out in favour of old school tricks rather than cheap looking garbage. By far the worst part was seeing the Shadowhunters tech, mixing high tech gadgets with this magical world feels like Bilbo Baggins texting Gandalf for advice.",/review/rw4166170/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2016,twilight-1010,10," Improving every week, absolutely obsessed now!
","I personally love this show so much! It took about five episodes to get above just decent, I'd rate the first five episodes a C- or 5.5/10 but after episode 5 I give the show a B+ or 8/10! Clace finally get a bit of chemistry in episode 7, Alec is perfect, the script gets slightly better with every episode I promise! The plot deviates from the books but that just keeps it interesting! The key points and incidents are definitely still there though. Malec is my favourite part of the show. I'm honestly so obsessed with this now and seriously hope it gets renewed for a season 2! That's when the storyline and character development would really get brilliant in my opinion. The cast are getting better every week and the only thing I have against it now really is the CGI/special effects but I get that they're on a low budget so I forgive that. Script still needs work but already seeing improvements as I said. If you are a fan of the books, movie or supernatural fantasy dramas you'll love this!",/review/rw4166170/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2016,edacheeky,8," Gradually improving, lots of potential. Overall enjoyable to watch.
","Shadowhunters, although not amazing and award-worthy, is still relatively enjoyable to watch. There are many aspects of the TV show that need improvement, but that doesn't mean that there aren't things the show has nailed. I personally have not read TMI yet and I feel that people are comparing the book and TV series too scrutinously. I feel that having not read the books has helped me enjoy the show rather than be frustrated that the show isn't sticking to the books. Among the cons, the acting of certain characters is quite cringe-worthy although some are new to acting so we can't judge them on this. The script was also pretty cheesy, but then again it reflects the target audience. Let's just hope that'll improve later on. Apart from that, I think a lot of us can agree that the institute design was not that great, it was way too techy and didn't feel homely at all. The pros, on the other hand, include SIMON! Simon is amazing in all respects! Alec and Isabelle were great throughout. Jace's character improved towards the end of season 1 which is great. I didn't know how to feel about Magnus at first but currently, at the close of season 1, I'm liking his character which is very much like Jack Sparrow, as youtuber Christine Riccio pointed out. With regards to Clary, I love her relationship with Simon, apart from that I don't think she grew much until towards the end of season 1, like Jace. I'm hoping for more improvement regarding the characters in the upcoming season.",/review/rw4166170/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2016,stevetrowbridge98,8," People are being too ridiculous and harsh.
","I enjoyed the pilot, despite the changes I really liked the pilot. So many other people are complaining about changes made to the TV show but guess what? They said ahead that there were going to be changes so many other people should have anticipated these changes. And apparently they did not, even though they claim otherwise. Yes, spoiler alert, they did change Clary's age, Luke's occupation and other minor stuff like that. Plus they have to make changes to appeal to everybody, not just book readers which I am. So really most of the changes are small, it's still following the same storyline so I think people need to chill out and realize that there were going to be changes anyway. And people are also complaining about the acting. Look, I'll be the first to admit that no one is going to win any Oscars or golden globes here but let's remember that about 60% of the cast is not very experienced. They are extremely new actors and it does show but I would not call it horrible, maybe shaky at some parts but overall I thought it was decent and I've seen much worse before believe me. And now for my final complaint: the ignorant people that are comparing this to twilight, calling it another twilight, and someone even saying that it was twilight fan fiction??? First of all TMI is WAY different from twilight, don't know where these certain people are getting that from. Second of all, I believe that TMI is WAY better than freaking Twilight. What, it's similar because it has romance in it and because there are vampires in it? Oh okay so every book, movie, or TV show that has romance and vampires is a twilight ripoff right? Get out of here with that. The vampires here DO NOT sparkle, in fact they burn if the sun touches them, and the romance? It's way more fleshed out and way more organic that the twilight romance, I can tell you that. So really I think people need to calm down and accept the changes. Plus, this is a pilot people, pilots are not always the best, sometimes they aren't very good and even though I thought the pilot was decent that still may have been the case here. Give the show a shot, don't just give up after the first episode because it could very well get better as the actors will have time to grow into their characters and maybe all of the people moaning and complaining will adapt to the changes. Believe me I HATE when I read a book that I really like and the adaption is no where near like the book but I don't feel like they changed so much here to warrant so much complaining.",/review/rw4166170/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2016,Grey2black,7," A New Shadow World Worth Exploring
","I've read almost all the books, but the story of Clary, Jace, Simon, Isabelle, Alec and Magnus... That one I know from start to finish. Can't say I appreciate the movie, but I've found this TV show to be quite interesting. Sure, it has deviated from the books, but I hardly know a TV show based on a book that hasn't. Even movies do it all the time. So I gave it a shot and I'm willing to follow it through. If I wanted to see the story of the books then I'd read the books. When I watch Shadowhunters is really to see what they're willing to do differently. And so far although it hasn't been great, it isn't poor either. I've found it to be a good show to follow. And until it becomes impossible to watch then I'll continue seeing it.",/review/rw4166170/?ref_=tt_urv

","Mortal Instruments by Cassandra Claire is an amazing book series and this web series has done a huge injustice to it. I was utterly disappointed on watching the episodes and couldn't get past a few. The acting is just terrible. There are no expressions on the cast's faces, the scenes look very disconnected, the way that the storyline is displayed is hugely disappointing.",/review/rw4166170/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2020,SnakeDis,5," Show for Bored teens nothing more
","The introduction was somehow decent first episode wasn't totally terrible the gci or i don't know what is called , was amazing showing great potentials but then comes clary or the (actor) first of all every time she speaks doesn't sound normal humanbeing would speak she speaks like she is the living incarnation of drama her acting didn't really make the character make sense at all and the dialogue was so corney i couldn't stand most conversations she made and she is the main character , Frist major flaw Her relationship with Jace i am not aganist romance but do it right all there conversations turns to be corney as hell and away from the point and overall not intersting, The actors didn't make me feel like they are the characters they are providing us poor acting and poor dialogue they had some were good but most of it was bad , Second major thing that doesn't make any sense is her going on missions without even being trained !, Moving on to the main villian for the first season and most of the second one ""Valentine"" i know that his name might be orginaly from the books but i seriously couldn't take someone called Valentine seriously even when his name comes in converstation i can't make a connection between his name and how serious the situation is , and the villian MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL like he betrayed his orginzation that he swore to serve and betrayed his ""brother like"" ""parptay bond"" i guess is called That's actually good made me intersted THEN Never telling us WHY HE DID IT? Gives us No Explination why he did it or Why he got SO MOTIVATED to do it ,Moving on to Clary's mother Now BIG ISSUE HERE Clarey mother had no importance to connect with the audiance we don't know her\seen enough of her to even care about her being kidnapped or to relate with what the main character felt when her mother died , Her mother had no VALUE in the show what so ever except being a motivation for the main character that's why when she died noone cared Then when clarey mother actually died clarey didn't express any emotion like your mother you were trying to save died A Horrible death two minutes ago And continue to say that she is : Okay, like why the hell were you so motivated to SAVE HER if you didn't care about her from the BEGINING??!!, it Simply doesn't make anysense it's a show for bored teens no more no less Even in that case you Watch this if it's your last resort.",/review/rw4166170/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2016,dontpanik,7," Much better than others would lead you to believe
","Let me start by saying that I loved the books and hated the movie so much I tried to get through it twice and never made it beyond the first 15 minutes. Does this stick completely to the books? No, of course not. It follows the story line much better than the movie. Remember, this isn't a mini series so they need to set up a broader world. The characters are true to type and so much better cast than the crappy movie. I can already see that I am going to like Simon. He's pretty much exactly like in the book and bonus, Alec doesn't look like one of their dads :D. 1pilots are almost always meh and require setting up the premise so don't worry about it being plot heavy. They settle in nicely in the second episode. (already on Hulu plus a week in advance). Give it a shot if you like the books.",/review/rw4166170/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2021,lyndadaneliuk,2," Appreciate the movie so much more now...
","Glad some folks are liking this, but the acting is extremely unfortunate. There's no real character development, wooden line reading, and they did a terrible job of introducing the story.

","Yes, I continued watching even though it pains me. I have read the books, watched the movie and now I am watching the series. I like to tell myself it is only because I like Cassandra Clare's concept of Shadowhunters livin off the grid protecting ungrateful mankind. I also like to think this is the only reason why there are 9 or 10 star ratings - people love it when their favourite books get put to the screen, no matter how abyssal the result.",/review/rw4166170/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2016,alicialouba,10," just give it a go.
","Give this show a chance. Just do it. People are complaining that the first episode was crap. I hope people realize that for some of the cast this is their major big break. Besides, it gets so much better! I'm sick of all the reviews that were published right after the first episode was released and people are listening to it as they think that is for the entire show when it is not. So, do the people who actually have waited for this show since March and are actually enjoying it, and don't spread negative hate around social media and whatnot because I surely am not the only one to see the show expand and explore. Not saying everyone has to like it, but please don't brainwash other people into thinking it is bad when it's not.
