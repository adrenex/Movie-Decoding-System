","This was not a show that I expected to be blown away with, although I am a long term fan of Sarah Lancashire, and with Sally Wainwright involved I should have expected it to be good.",/review/rw6449547/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2014,ianlouisiana,10," Wonderful writing,great performances.TV drama at its best.
","One day Mr S.Pemberton will be recognised for the superb actor that he is.In ""Benidorm"" he plays the outwardly crass Garvey paterfamilias as a completely believable bloody - minded Manc,but his performance slowly reveals him to be a loving husband and father frustrated by his inability to articulate his emotions. From ""The League of Gentlemen"" to ""Inside No.9"" he has displayed the ability to act and perform comedy outside the box and in ""Happy Valley"" he has reached a new level as an embittered accountant who conceives a plan to hold his boss's daughter for ransom after being refused a pay rise.He passes the plan on to a local villain then finds his boss has changed his mind. Horror - stricken,he goes to the local nick where he meets sympathetic Sgt Cawood(the equally inspired Miss S.Lancashire),but runs off before she can get the truth out of him. Sgt Cawood has what you might call ""issues"" as her daughter committed suicide after giving birth to a child as a result of rape.Incidentally,she is buried in a graveyard near Sylvia Plath.Not surprisingly the child has ""issues"" too as does Sgt Cawood's sister(The mighty Miss S Finneran - Mrs Garvey in ""Benidorm"" -who is a recovering heroin addict. But please don't think that ""Happy Valley"" is a drama that disappears up it's own self - pitying bottom because all the women are too tough for that particular cliché to apply. Instead they front it out as the rapist is released from prison,gets a job with the local bad guy who is engineering the kidnapping and proceeds to rape the victim. Miss Lancashire is the best,toughest and cleverest female cop since Miss Frances McDormand in ""Fargo"".It would never surprise me if in the end she didn't feed the rapist into a woodchipper.I certainly don't fancy his chances of staying alive,let alone free. What with ""Happy Valley"" and the female - led ""The Crimson Field"",the BBC are leading TV drama out of its male - dominated somewhat patriarchal comfort - zone and giving us some real warts and all portraits of women who are not content to make tea and cakes while hubby rides home on the 4.55.from Victoria.",/review/rw6449547/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2014,Tweekums,10," A dark drama
",Kevin Weatherill is an ordinary man doing an ordinary job as an accountant; he is not happy man though; he wants to send his daughter to a private school but his boss refuses to give him a raise. When he sees that another client is dealing drugs he comes up with a plan he will get this man to kidnap his boss's daughter and use the ransom to pay the school fees. This man agrees and the plan is set in motion. Keven later changes his mind but by now it is too late the girl is about to be kidnapped by a couple of men; including the thoroughly unpleasant ex-con Tommy Lee Royce. Royce is already known to the police; most notably Sgt Catherine Cawood; Royce raped her daughter leaving her pregnant but nothing could be proved. Following her daughter's suicide she is determined that Royce will get nowhere near her grandson and hopes to put him back in gaol as soon as possible she doesn't know about his latest offence though; nobody has reported the kidnap to the police an inaction that will have fatal consequences.,/review/rw6449547/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2014,Red_Identity,," Absorbing, tense, and wonderfully acted
","I expected something slow paced, in the vein of The Killing. Not at all, but it's absorbing and tense from the start, very mainstream-accessible, and always intriguing. The acting from all involved is pretty excellent, especially Sarah Lancashire. An amazing performance, one that I hope gets serious awards recognition next year. I ultimately liked this more than I expected to, it's easy to get caught up in its plot and I also think that it does a great job moving it along at a surprisingly fast pace while also having some fantastic character moments. At times it gets a bit too over-the-top in its melodrama, but it never actually fails to emotionally hit home. I'm super ecstatic that it's coming back for a second season.",/review/rw6449547/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2014,josephsoap21,10," By far the best series I've seen on TV this year
","I cannot praise this series enough. It has an air of realism about it from its location to the main actors. The lead sergeant Catherine Cawood and her sister are so ordinary, preoccupied with ordinary things, (no trendy,smarmy,clever middle class media interpretations of what ordinary people speak like dialog). Without exception every character is believable. With master classes in acting from the lead, her sister, her grandson and Tommy the maniac. The criminals are believably cruel and stupid in measure. The damaged and unfortunate are portrayed realistically but with compassion. No left wing idealism or right wing coldness that usually invades these type of program. The setting is the bleakest place I've ever seen, a beautiful English valley shrouded in mist, dampness and high rises. The streets and buildings are claustrophobic. Most of all the story is credible, consistent and finely paced. raw emotions are not avoided and dysfunction is everywhere. And yet there's something noble in sergeant Catherine Cawood.",/review/rw6449547/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2014,rven3,10," BAFTA material
","I thought 'Scott & Bailey"" to be extraordinary - and it is - but ""Happy Valley"" is gut wrenching, heart stopping, uncomfortable, and totally, totally brilliant. Firstly, nothing of quality can be created without a very good script, and Sally Wainwright's script is her best yet, and rivals her Scott & Bailey scripts. The dialogue crackles with its own rhythm, and sharp observations of modern life, while the emerging story is all at once shocking as it is at times ordinary.",/review/rw6449547/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2014,cliffmacdev,10," As good as Telly can get.

4 June 2014,jarcheese2012,10," Intense
","The most intense, well written, well acted crime series I've ever seen on television. For six weeks I've been hooked on a story that uses a police drama as a framework for the human emotions that are at the core of this fantastic series. Steve Pemberton (The League of Gentlemen, Inside No 9) as the self-interested accountant out of his depth when a kidnapping plot goes horribly wrong was brilliant and James Norton was easily one of the best psychopaths I've ever seen in a television drama. There was real depth to his character and I expect he was hated by viewers as much as Joffre in Game of Thrones nonsense police officer. But it was Sarah Lancashire's show all the way as the tough, no-nonsense, but damaged police officer. At first I thought this was going to go the way of the film Fargo, with it's kidnapping-gone-wrong scenario, but by the start of the second episode it was clear that it was going to take a different path. Be warned though, it's dark and unsettling with moments of sudden shocking violence, especially at the end of the fourth episode, where I was left shaking at the sheer intensity of it all. Better than anything American crime dramas have had to offer us over the past year, it was brilliant. Absolutely bloody brilliant!",/review/rw6449547/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2020,gallagherkellie,8," Great cop show
","I love how the British do crime shows! So raw and realistic.
The main actress is amazing, she does such a good job at being equally scary and sweet.
It's got some good twists and shock moments. Definitely worth watching.",/review/rw6449547/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2014,info-6-485649,10," Stunning drama
","I've been thoroughly enjoying this dark gritty drama. All the leads are excellent, but Sarah Lancashire as the main police officer with a tragic family history, is outstanding. It started well then just got better and better with each episode and twist of the plot (and screw) having me on the edge of my seat. I've just watched what must be the penultimate episode and it has left me physically shaking - it was that convincing and shocking. It's hard to credit the complaint of mumbling by one reviewer. I can't recall even one line of script I didn't follow and it's usually something that bugs me. I'm so glad I've watched this series, it's got to be one of (if not the) best TV dramas of 2014.",/review/rw6449547/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2016,kalle_ankare,10," None better
","The fact that Sgt Catherine Cawood is not a real person but a character played by an actress is completely 100% inconceivable. The portrayal is SO real in every aspect. It's real in every mannerism, in the shift between her persona as a private person and police officer, in the way she dresses, the way she wears her hair, her make up, the choices she makes and how she behaves. I've never seen a performance like it in my life. So extremely vulnerable, yet so extremely strong and when push comes to shove so extremely brave and tough. I for one would not want to cross her, for she would surely kick my behind severely, at the same time I sure would want her to talk to if ever I was victimized.",/review/rw6449547/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2014,juanita-langley,9," Absolutely riveting
","This drama series is indescribably good. What takes place in the first 10 min of episode 3 has left me, a very brave and unflinching movie/TV watcher, shocked to the core. I was so upset that I had to pause the show to regain my composure. Sarah Lancashire's portrayal of Catherine Cawood is leaving me in awe and I find myself counting the days to the next episode. It is impossible not to feel her passion for policing, her incredible pain at the lost of her daughter and the disappointment she has in her failed marriage and ex husband. The fury I feel towards Kevin Weatherill for his stupid and selfish act that culminates in the horror that is this show, is testament to Steve Pemberton's brilliant acting. If you do not watch this series you are seriously missing out on maybe the best ever detective show made in the UK.",/review/rw6449547/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2019,Calicodreamin,10," Thoroughly enjoyed watching
","A delightful drama about an English police Sargent and her tumultuous home life that weaves in and out of her work life.
The main character Catherine is amazing in so many ways. Kind, but strong, strict, but loving. She shines in this show.
Each season focuses on the solving of one major crime, but interweaves small plot lines and family drama.
You'll be sure to fall in love with the characters.",/review/rw6449547/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2014,albatosh,10," Gripping, Powerful, Tense, 100% drama at it's best
","Happy Valley......not for most of the residents! The BBC tend to (every now and then) come up with a block busting drama series. This one had (and has) me gripped to my seat from the start. Clever interaction between all the cast and 'Superb' acting on the part of every actor/actress including Corrie's Sarah Lancashire and Benidorm's Steve Pemberton. Great Yorkshire setting, the atmosphere oozes out of every brick & stone. Edge of the seat stuff, every episode ending in a cliff hanger.. Please let there be more BBC, you do have an awful habit of killing of great drama series just when everyone is hooked (e.g. Garrow's Law). Bring on season two please (writer) Sally Wainwright",/review/rw6449547/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2014,flying_pixel,9," Just give her the award now - Sarah Lancashire
","I've only just realised what a great actress Sarah Lancashire is (I last saw her as a dizzy blonde in Coronation Street!). In the whole range of the Happy Valley character its the silences, those long lingering close-ups of her face as it conveys everything she doesn't have to say. One minute you feel sorry for the poor sod; next your laughing at the characters directness; next your almost in tears as she drives to hold herself together in the face of crippling memories. The story itself it terrific but sitting in the middle is Catherine Cawood, the dedicated, honest, seen-it-all-before, no-nonsense copper. The writer who opened the story with the confrontation with a smack-head allowed some cracking dialogue to kick the series off and show us the character we will grow to like and care for. The BAFTA's hers!",/review/rw6449547/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,jdhb-768-61234,10," Simply the Best
","The original ""Happy Valley"" six-parter has to be the best, or at least the best I've ever seen, police dramas series. The story is brilliant, the casting, acting and direction superb and the absence of 'background dramatic music' is a God send which adds so much to the overall ambience. Viewers are actually able to hear the dialogue and aren't distracted by the annoyance of entirely unnecessary noise which does nothing to enhance the drama, in fact, it diminishes it.",/review/rw6449547/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2014,dnolan714,9," Excellent British Drama
","My wife and I were surfing the net one lazy Sunday afternoon and I found Happy Valley on Netflix. BBC television frequently has shows we enjoy so we pulled it up and began watching the series. It's started off slow and it takes a bit to catch up with the language and how it flows but we're good at understanding the dialog. The longer we watched the more we became engrossed in the story line. I'm a retired cop after 30 years on the job and yes there were some minor flaws in basic cop stuff but I'm forgiving ....it's a show, not reality. The writing and acting were impeccable. The story flows and the many strands of the story began to come into one main story. We recommend you just sit and watch as it unfolds, you will enjoy the story. The individual actors had their characters spot on and really developed their individualism. Human behavior and rationalization of ones actions were mingled throughout the characters. Despicable, weak minded individuals, criminal types and then the sociopath one that really stands out from the minor league criminals...it's all in this show. Honestly, we watched the entire series ( 6 hours ) in one afternoon and evening. I've already checked and noted that the BBC has renewed the show for another season so we can see the Sergeant build her character even more, along with the supporting cast.",/review/rw6449547/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2014,Brentdavids,10," Breathtaking Stunning Exceptional Brilliant
","I cannot fault this Police/Crime drama. The writer has proved again, as with Scott and Bailey she has a feel for UK Policing and the consequences for the victims, offenders and officers involved of the crime. I was pretty much in tears at one point following one of the scenes and was astonished at how amazing Sarah Lancashires' performance was. Thiswas truly BAFTA material all round with faultless performances that's why 10/10. I sincerely hope they do not have a second series but let this remain a one off spectacular piece of TV. I understand a second series has been discussed but why would you risk blemishing a perfectly constructed drama?",/review/rw6449547/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2014,camdentownie13,10," British character drama at its very best
","The best thing on TV since Broadchurch, and it may even have the edge. Sarah Lancashire's performance is the glue that holds the whole story together, but every character is painted in broad strokes without a cliché among them.",/review/rw6449547/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2014,AudioFileZ,8," Solid Brit Crime Drama
","The Brits have a way with crime dramas and it isn't just the gray overcast horizon. No, free of the Hollywood shine there's a palpable sense of struggling with the added weight of bad people intersecting, and changing, the lives of everyday folk. In a very personal struggle we find a survivor, a mother and a police woman, who rises to be morea real heroine.",/review/rw6449547/?ref_=tt_urv

","Absolutely incredible Drama with a capital ""D"". Please tell me they are talking with Sarah Lancashire about a second series.I look forward to seeing Sarah, the cast and production team at all the award ceremonies this year.BRILLIANT!! and we have only seen 4 episodes. The locations, the camera work,the wardrobe and the realistic make up all combine to give the episode such realism it is at times genuinely frightening.In my experience fear generated when watching TV comes only with groundbreaking drama of the highest order. The cast leave me breathless with admiration at such fine performances from all involved but like all great team efforts there is one shining light giving a career best performance as Catherine Cawood that is Sarah Lancashire.",/review/rw6449547/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2019,elizrug,9," Brilliant acting

20 October 2015,BeneCumb,8," Externally strong, internally fragile policewoman in a rough-and-tough environment
","Like Scandinavians, the will and power of the Brits to produce both interesting and seamless crime series have not faded away - Happy Valley is another fine example of it. And things are realistic, happening at present, in a small English county with its ups-and-downs, yet not making the place on the harshest crime spots of the world (as it sometimes seems when following Miss Marple's and Morse-Lewis' activities :) ).",/review/rw6449547/?ref_=tt_urv
