","Or the truth of wars, when wrong fully targeted elements of society are hit due to either wrongdone calculation or just willfully, it hurts generations to come anyhow. Copenhagen where hit, but also bergen , laksevåg in norway where also hit by the brits when trying to raid u-boot bunkers, missing and taking out a elementary school instead, with massive amout of casualties why i mention this is that my friends mum survived the ordeal, and ive always been admiring her gut and how she told her stories, when youre a history geek yourself...",/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2022,peterrichboy,8," One of the saddest tales WW2
","I've never really understood the term friendly fire, it's a term used in the war time when a Allied troops or planes accidentally kills or Injures troops or civilians of an allied country. There really is nothing friendly about this especially when it came to the 86 children killed during the bombing raid on the Copenhagen Gestapo offices in 1945. You can't help but feel this was something that should never have happened with experienced crew as the war reached its conclusion, especially as it was a daytime raid.",/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2022,chad-61313,10," Excellent
","I thought this film was going to be a slow burn, but I was completely wrong. From story line to the acting, everything about this movie blew me away. Such a tragic tale and the producers, directors, cast, made u feel like u were in the middle of it all. It's a heartbreaking, true story and you'll realize how much the innocent suffer during times of war. Don't miss this one!!",/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv

",Wow what an incredible piece of storytelling about a true event .,/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2022,allankaaber,10," Shockingly awful scenes
","Words can not describe the horrors that occurred on march 21st 1945 in Copenhagen, but Ole Bornedal does a really good job. This could very well be one of the top 5 ever made movies about WW2.",/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2022,albertval-69560,8," War and Its Horrible Miscalculations
","Indeed, this is a gripping story by any standard. One of the unintended unfortunate consequences of war to the unaffected bystander but deeply tragic to the victims' families.",/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2022,Finalreminder,8," A worthy watch
","As a cold hearted SOB it's extremely rare to find a film that hits me in the feels, but this one certainly did. Well written and executed and fantastic child actors. This is up there with some of the best war films in my opinion.",/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2022,patherwill,9," Don't want to think of parallels
","Horrible to think of the circumstances that make this such an incredibly moving film especially as it is a true story.. RAF bombers head for Copenhagen to bomb the Nazi headquarters out of existence, where its its occupants have placed a human shield in the building. However, as with all the best plans something goes very wrong and..........? Fanny Bornedal (daughter of the writer director) plays the mischievous, maverick Nun, Sister Teresa who is able to win over the school children as she speaks and acts on their level. The real stars include Bertram Enevoldson, Ester Birch and Ella Nilsson as three of the kids. Keep the tissues within reach.",/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2022,kosmasp,8," Topical much
","Hopefully not in the World War (3) sense, but just in the sense of Ukraine being invaded by Russia. And the bombing of facilities and houses that are not quite necessary. A meanigless war and a lot of grieving and hurt people left ... more so every day it goes on.",/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2022,orkneyislander,8," Well made
",Covering the WWII RAF raid 'Operation Carthage' Some harrowing scenes that added to the realism. And good acting from the children involved.,/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,turtleloverules,9," The Bombardment
","This biopic was a sad commentary on mans endless pursuit of power through war. The character development was rich, and the soundtrack was stirring. Always looking for a new foe, when the enemy is within. 9 stars for poignancy.",/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2022,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,7," Perfect timing. Tragic true story.
","As another reviewer mention, I too feel the release of this film right now is perfect timing in lieu of the current events happening right now in Ukraine. How history repeats itself is insane.",/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,hawaiialin,10," Masterpiece
","Very sad to see, but this was done so well. Acting on the spot, cinematography brilliant, you get sucked into the action and just brilliant. Very very tragic story, be warned this is hard to swallow...",/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2022,biffpsych,9," The Middle of an Epic Film
","This was difficult to watch (for historical reasons). I saw it as ""The Bombardment"" on Netflix for its U. S. release March of 2022. So many productions have portrayed the horrors of WWII and without diminishing such a profound impact those events had on the world. I did not know this story, and it was a punch in the gut. What a tragic event!",/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2022,SpartacusSuperBowl,10," Harrowing and deeply affective
","This is a harrowing World War 2 story, with a deep emotional impact earned through distinctive characters. Spartacus Super Bowl won't say much more, to avoid spoilers, but the child actors in this Danish film are truly wonderful.",/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2022,screenwriter-972-149612,10," War is unspeakable
","Not the most assured '10' I've ever given. But there are moments in this film that do what drama on film was meant to do, tell a story visually. Tell it as clearly and as artistically as the narrative will allow. This movie does that magnificently. Two scenes, among many, will prove that point and deserve your attention.",/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2021,maorimahara-36520,9," Denmark,21st of March 1945
",I've always been interested in everything that has to do with WWII. My grandmothers brother worked in the underground against the nazis who occupied Denmark and unfortunately was shot by some German fanatics and left to bleed to death on the roadside in Skærbæk/Denmark - one day AFTER Denmark was liberated.,/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2022,BijeshNagesh,8," Stirring & Emotional
","A deeply mournful and emphatic WWII story that sees the ravages of warfare through the eyes of everyday citizens instead of soldiers, ""The Shadow in My Eye"" is a remarkable lesson in pathos-driven truth-telling. The movie was based on actual events, and dramatized where required.",/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2022,grglmn,10," Amazing Movie
","I was transfixed from start to finish. Best movie I have seen in some time. Acting is very good, dubbing in English not distracting. The children and adult characters are Interesting. The story is beyond moving. Some scenes definitely not for the faint of heart. Most of the criticism seems to be against the nun's character, given the times, some questions regarding faith from anybody makes sense.",/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2022,denise-882-139023,9," Children and War
","This film is about the accidental bombing of a school in Copenhagen and the horrific loss of innocent lives. It does not dwell on the whys and wherefores of the accident. It just happened. Should the RAF have been bombing in city centres? Whatever the reasoning, this film does not comment, it just is.",/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2022,robcallawayvfr,9," Incredible child actors, moving and relevant film
",I thought twice about watching the film as the subject matter seemed too close to what we're currently seeing on the news happening to the poor people in Ukraine.,/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2022,jimpd,8," What a sad story.
","The biggest mistake in the movie is, that Bornedal tries to fit a love story in and it failed. I rather wanted more about why Shellhuset should be bombed rather then text before the movie, that by the way difficult to read.",/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2022,braids-10242,8," A true reflection of war!
","Having watched this epic, true war movie today,I can relate this unforgiving world war 2 film with a realistic inside look at what is happening in today's war on Ukraine. Fantastic actors and brillant camera work,i do not want to give any spoilers by saying much more. The only people who suffer in war are the innocent!",/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2022,ghatbkk,10," Not a happy tale, but a true one well told
","Extraordinarily well told story of the RAF bombing raid against the Gestapo headquarters in Copenhagen and the accidental bombing of a children's school not far away. This is not a happy story, it is about the trauma of war and the tragedy of war. And it should be watched.",/review/rw7978778/?ref_=tt_urv
