3 December 2021,ronin-88,6," For fans of Millie Bobby Brown
","The acting was very well done and charming. There were a lot of good moments and some beautiful shots. Millie Bobby Brown is solid in her role. Also, the fight scenes were well executed. The supporting cast was largely excellent. But, the writing came up short. The beginning was one long voiceover and rather dull. Enola's looks at the camera were fun but too much of the story was told that way. They violated the ""show, don't tell' tenet of all good fiction. Also, if you're a Sherlock Holmes fan, you might be somewhat turned off by this movie. If you're Millie Bobby Brown fan though, you'll probably love it. I still like her character in this - it was good to see her have an opportunity to play someone so different from Eleven on Stranger Things.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2020,faolanredwolf,6," Not for Sherlock Holmes fans, but not bad either.
","Enola Holmes is absolutely wonderful, quirky and charming. You'll absolutely love it, unless you're a Sherlock Holmes fan, then it quickly looses its charms. They basically change every character completely to fit the story, rendering them unrecognisable. But, it's made for young teen girls and they will love it. I should also add, that Henry Cavill is one of the worst Sherlock Holmes, I've ever seen. I genuinely like him as an actor, but in this case I think he was terribly miscast.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2020,jesamazinghawley,8," Perfect for a 15 yro girl
","This is the movie I wish I had at 15. This isn't about Sherlock Holmes. It's not about solving a mystery or surprising the audience. It's about a teenage girl finding out who she is. It was charming, funny, wonderfully acted, aesthetically pleasing, and sweet. If you are a grown man criticizing it, Back off. This wasn't made for you. Or me. This was made for 15 yro girls. And the fifteen year old girl in me LOVED it.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2020,boggie4758,7," A cute little movie
","I must have watched a different movie then some of these viewers. This was better than a 1,2,point movie..It was a cute movie. Millie has become a really good actress. This was not a Sherlock Holmes movie..is was a movie of the fictional little sister of Holmes. I thought is was very well acted and I even loved how she would speak to the audience, that was a good touch....this was very much worth seeing. I enjoyed it.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2020,korpake,5," It could have been so much more...
","Interesting premise, interesting setting, good actors, terrible writing.
The plot is all over the place.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2020,evanston_dad,4," Not the Target Audience
","I acknowledge that I'm not the target audience for this movie, but come on, it still could have been more entertaining than it was.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2020,zekehardrock,9," Am I the only man who love this movie?
","Mille Bobby Brown is excellent, Sam Claflin is extraordinary and Henry Cavil is being Henry Cavil. The Production is great, the story is heart warming but the mystery is not to much.
I cant wait to see the spin off with Henry Cavil as Sherlock Holmes.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2020,the_oak,9," Fun, sweet and uplifting
","I enjoyed this movie and I am someone who is in the center politically. I sometimes think woke culture is pushed too much, but not in this movie. In my opinion this movie is about being your own person. I loved the acting and had no problems accepting the story.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv

23 September 2020,pranayjalvi,5," Millie Bobby Brown solves a dull mystery in Netflix's disappointing Enola Holmes
","Without much of a mystery to solve, this young Holmes comes across more like a junior-level Wonder Woman: intelligent and highly trained yet puzzled by this unfamiliar, unfair world of men.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2020,tocanepauli,8," A charming film - good for the whole family!
","Rarely nowadays can we find a film that everyone in the family can watch together but happily this is one of those films. Charming characters, good story, action, lovely landscapes...
Just a very enjoyable film....",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2020,Sleepin_Dragon,6," It's good family fun, not to be taken seriously.
","How wonderful would this film have been for teatime on Boxing Day, it very much has that cosy, family viewing vibe.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2020,s3276169,5," Oh the irony......
","I'll start by saying this is not one for me. Its pitched squarely at teenage girls. My concern is the rather nasty underlying message about men, that's part of the baggage.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2020,blanche-2,7," family entertainment
","I agree with one of the people who posted here. People very often view a film not for what it is, but what they either think it should be or want it to be. As the poster pointed out, this isn't a Quentin Tarantino film. It's well-done family entertainment about the adventures of a young woman, Enola Holmes, as she sets out to find her missing mother.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2021,mrocco-1,5," I'm a woman
","What a shocker, another 'Men are BAD' movie. The top review says ' If you are a grown man criticizing it, back off'. I'm a grown woman, grew up in the 60's and 70's, and I'm criticizing it. The new world order is to portray all (or even the majority of) men as controlling towards women and girls, which is simply not the truth. It hurts to see society is swallowing this load of crap hook line and sinker. To be told you need to be empowered is to take away the power you already have.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2020,Calicodreamin,5," A bit boring
","The storyline was a bit bland and disjointed, a lot going on but no substance. The acting was fairly good and the costumes were great. The looking into the camera narration was borderline creepy and didn't add anything to the story.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2020,Idle_Hands08,7," Teen Version of the Guy Ritchie genre
","This movie was a lot of fun... I'm a fan of the action packed Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes films, and this felt a lot like a PG-13 version of those films... It's rated M for the action sequences, which were well done, but definitely had that PG feel to it. The production design, acting, soundtrack, and pacing of the story were all very good... I would have scripted the final 15 minutes differently, but it still worked in the scheme of the plot and the motivations of the main characters. Millie Bobby Brown is a great young actor and is again the corner stone of this film. A new take on a classic, just enjoy it for what we enjoy films for... A fun, engaging story...",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2020,eddie_baggins,5," A fast-paced but forgettable addition to the Sherlock cannon
","If there was one thing the cinematic universe probably didn't need it was yet another iteration of the Sherlock Holmes universe but proving once more Hollywood the film world in general seems to be content resurrecting and re-imaging properties until they are no longer filled with any life left in them, along comes Enola Holmes.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2020,Leofwine_draca,3," Not one for purists
","Inevitably as I'm not in the target teen market for this film I ended up hating it, but then I'm a guy approaching it as a fan of Conan Doyle and authentic screen depictions of Sherlock Holmes, not this modernist teen fantasy version. And this film is pure fantasy, not even attempting to look into the moral codes and etiquette of Victorian society, but instead throwing in random disparate elements including all-female ju jitsu clubs and the sight of a random artistocrat cavorting around the countryside with a female minor. The plot hinges on a ridiculous, underwritten and uninteresting mystery, while the cast is littered with familiar faces ill at ease in their roles: Helena Bonham Carter, whose entire role is rather pointless; Henry Cavill, who couldn't be more miscast if he tried. The only decent performances come from Burn Gorman (once more typecast as an assassin) and the excellent Millie Bobby Brown, whose charisma and exuberance shine off the screen.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2020,daillstate,7," Please make a sequel
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film. All of my preconceived notions of this movie were tossed out from the start. I'm so glad she's not a Mary Sue, with her flaws. 16 year olds weren't here children at the turn of the 20th century, so it's refreshing to showcase this. At the same time, they made an error, in my opinion. They made mention of the Ritz hotel, but it wasn't opened until 1906. Otherwise, everybody did a good job. Breaking the 4th wall was a nice touch as well.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2020,oscarflash,7," Millie as Enola
","All I can say Millie has a great future a head, she was brilliant the entire movie is based on her great performance and the entire cast and crew did a great job to show how awesome actor Millie is.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2021,bob_bear,3," Anachronistic Bunkum
","If you enjoy anacronystic casting and a feminist agenda crowbarred into Victorian setting, you'll love this. I don't, so I didn't.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2020,kosmasp,7," Female Holmes
","Sherlock Holmes ... has a sister? Interesting and why not? I know some may have issues with that, but think about all the girls who know can have some fun too. And that is the target audience. Young female viewers. That doesn't mean you can't have fun watching this, if you are not in that specific demographic. It just means, you are more likely to enjoy it, if you are.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2021,lee_eisenberg,7," it goes to Eleven
","I should start by noting that I've never read any of the books depicting Sherlock Holmes's younger sister. In fact, I've never read any of Arthur Conan Doyle's original novels. Coming into ""Enola Holmes"" completely unaware of its background, I was pleased. The point is to be entertaining, and the movie is just that. In a role quite different from Eleven on ""Stranger Things"", Millie Bobby Brown plays Enola as a vivacious girl out to challenge the Victorian era's gender norms while solving a mystery. It's nothing spectacular, but will be enjoyable if you have nothing else to watch.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2020,musicalfreakgurl,," Breaking The Fourth Wall and Feminism
","I read quite a few reviews forsaking this movie. While I understand their standings, I don't think they understood the movie. There were several revolutionary women during the time of the movie and before it. Shall I remind people of Joan of Arc?! Anyway, back to the movie. The background was about ENOLA HOLMES NOT SHERLOCK. There are plenty of movies about him even if she did not exist in Sir Arthur's books. While the movie had undertones of feminism, it was mainly about a coming of age story, where society expects you to conform to their standards instead of being an individual, much like today. Also, when Millie was talking to the audience it is a real thing called Breaking The Fourth Wall, which is a term for the invisible wall that exists between the world the play or movie in this case is in, and the audience.",/review/rw6118289/?ref_=tt_urv
