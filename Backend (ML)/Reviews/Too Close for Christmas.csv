11 March 2014,shawneofthedead,8," It may skip a couple of beats, but this is still a pretty great number.
","Typically, coming-of-age stories unfold in a predictable fashion: kid tentatively ventures into the world beyond the one he knows, where he encounters people and things that will change him and his outlook on life forever. It would be easy to dismiss Kill Your Darlings as yet another entry in a tired genre: the tale of a poet who finds his voice through a heady cocktail of sex, drugs and college. But John Krokidas' debut feature film, which takes as its subjects the American poets of the revolutionary Beat Generation, fits in so much more, as it explores a haunting search for life and legacy that teeters close to the edge of death.",/review/rw3022439/?ref_=tt_urv

11 December 2013,l_rawjalaurence,6," Slightly Muddled Tale of the Beat Generation
","John Krokidas' film explores the early life of Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe), and how he came into contact with Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan), Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston), and William Burroughs (Ben Foster). Through their association the ideas of the Beat Generation were born. The film starts off very promisingly, depicting Ginsberg's early life at home in Paterson, New Jersey, and his subsequent career at Columbia University. We understand something of he and his friends wanted to rebel against established conventions - not only literary but societal conventions. The 'official' view, as propounded by Professor Stevens (John Cullum) seems stuffy and old-fashioned. As the action progresses, however, so the film's priorities become diluted; rather than focusing on the genesis of the Beats, the action concentrates instead on the complex love-triangle involving Lucien, Allen and David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall). We are given the distinct suggestion all of three of them are emotionally immature, which thereby reduces the significance of their 'rebellion.' Matters are not helped by Radcliffe's rather colorless performance as Ginsberg - his expressions rarely change from being rather bemused as what's happening around him. A brave attempt at recreating the values of a previous generation, but the director seems to lose the courage of his convictions.",/review/rw3022439/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's a story of the poet Allen Ginsberg's youth, from a nice Jewish kid in Patterson, New Jersey, to a dropout from Columbia University in 1944. This milieu -- and the neighborhood called North Beach in San Francisco -- produced the Beat Generation or Beatniks. Many of them, the ones we meet in this film, went on to considerable but ephemeral fame -- Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs, and Ginsberg himself, probably best noted for his poem ""Howl."" The title, ""Kill Your Darlings,"" is from William Faulkner who, taken either by a fit of absurdity or maybe drunkenness, advised writers to delete those passages in their manuscripts that they liked best.

","In 1942 Paterson, NJ Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe) is trying to keep the peace between his cold poet father Louis (David Cross) and his unstable mother Naomi (Jennifer Jason Leigh). As a freshman in Columbia University, he befriends outgoing rebel Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan) in the tradition bound atmosphere. He introduces Allen to his friends William Burroughs (Ben Foster), jealous David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall), and Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston) with his girlfriend Edie Parker (Elizabeth Olsen).

","Director and co-writer (with Austin Bunn) John Krokidas have created an atmospheric visit to the beginnings of one of literary history's great movements – the Beat Generation – and in doing so have carved a fine story that combines not only the rise of the Beats but also examines the slow emergence of recognition of sexual identity crises, in both a positive and a critical manner. Cast with a group of very fine actors and accompanied with musical director Nico Muhly's sensitive score that includes the references to Brahms symphonies and trios and transcriptions of themes along with terrific excerpts from Harlem's jazz scene (courtesy of Dawn Newman as a jazz singer), this film is successful on many levels, not the least of which is the reminder of the permanent impact on American literature and sociology imprinted by the likes of Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and William Burroughs. The very sensitive opening sequence, appreciated only at film's end, sets the dark tone of the film and opens the window to understanding the Beats (also called ""the Libertine Circle"" by Ginsberg).",/review/rw3022439/?ref_=tt_urv

This is proof that there is an acting life for Daniel Radcliffe after Harry Potter. It is a thrilling and provocative must see. The film flows beautifully and keeps you entranced. This film pushes the limits to new depths that the industry is in desperate need of. I left the film feeling like my mind had been opened to a whole new level.

20 February 2015,j-penkair,7," Madness and Insanity
","The film would be enjoyed by fans of the Beat Generation's poets and homosexuals who take their birth rights seriously, or both. I am a homosexual and I did enjoy this one tremendously. Not in so many films that homosexuality serves only as an undertone, despite some visualized images of homosexual lovemaking. Absolute love of freedom becomes the overriding theme of this bunch of homosexual artists. I think this film will get all of us closer to a natural treatment of the third sex. Homosexuals would be equaled to heterosexuals when their ""issue"" ceases to be an issue for the public at large. The film is not trying to tell the whole story of these artists. Just a very thin slice was chosen to be told, and what a slice it was. My country, Thailand, is still stuck with the 18th Century superhuman theory of politics. All moral codes are determined by how much you love and glorify the king. Nothing else really matters. Even a murder is construed by law as being better than libeling the king, his family members, and his men. So I understand how it feels to be so free, and be met with ultra-conservatism at times. Madness can come as a result of being free, but the lack of it would drive you insane. Quite a different of psychological episodes. I encourage you to watch this film and do more research about these characters. You will end up knowing a lot more about yourself.",/review/rw3022439/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Under the right circumstances even he might change the world."" Columbia University in the 1940's unknowingly gave life to some of the best poets in the world. Alan Ginsberg (Radcliffe) shows up and is almost instantly dissatisfied with what he finds. The school is too straight laced as far as teaching goes. He meets future legends Lucien Carr (DeHaan), William S. Burroughs and Jack Kerouac. What starts off as a group trying to change the world spirals out of control until a murder changes the lives of all of them. I have never been ""hip"" or into the beat poet scene. Never been a fan of Kerouac or even a big fan of Hunter S. Thompson for that matter. Not really sure why but they just never appealed to me. I watched On The Road but wasn't that impressed so I wasn't all that excited about watching this one. I do have to admit that this was much better then I expected. This one had a Dead Poet's Society aspect to it and I think that is why I ended up liking it. If you are a fan of the beat poet generation then you will love this. I liked how the character interactions grew to an explosive resolution, that was interesting to me. Overall, much better then On The Road, but this movie made me want to watch that one again now that I know more about the relationships. I give this a B.",/review/rw3022439/?ref_=tt_urv

","A little over an hour-and-a-half, but seems much longer. Little to no conflict one can care about - Kammerer just pops in and out of the narrative, which can't sustain any sense of tension between him and Carr, or Ginsberg. The central figures of Burroughs, Ginsberg, Kerouac, and Carr come across as shallow and self-absorbed. Perhaps at that young age they were, but that doesn't make for compelling drama. And the montage surrounding the murder, with its heavy-handed penetration imagery, is so over-the-top obvious to be almost ridiculous. The cinematography is just ugly - I realize the lighting, color palette etc. were deliberate artistic choices, but it still looks unappealing. The actors do a good job with what they are given (Foster as Burroughs is especially good, capturing his cadence, inflection, and mannerisms without descending into mimicry), but overall the film is unfocused, slack, and unpleasant.",/review/rw3022439/?ref_=tt_urv

","Daniel Racliffe takes up the part of notable poet Allen Ginsberg here, but I'm fairly certain most audience members of the Harry Potter generation will still see the little magician in him for years to come. So is this Radcliffe's big breakthrough movie as an adult. Not really. It's still a decent effort though and from the visual standpoint he's certainly a good choice for the character. Here he is truly interesting and somehow involved (though not directly) with his best friend murdering another man.

","As if you couldn't tell from the title, Kill Your Darlings is a pretty heavy drama. It takes place in the 1940s, focusing on the Beat Generation poets going to college and discovering themselves. If you don't like that group of artists, you will not like this movie. (For that matter, you won't like the 2010 biopic Howl either.)

","It's no surprise that some of the most effective works of the Beatnik generation were born in the scuzzy halls of jazz bars; soaked with whiskey induced grammar, intoxicated with muddled philosophies, their pages bathed in the permanent smell of tobacco. Much like the work of Lewis Carroll, drugs, alcohol, and culture were catalysts towards the ideology of destroying the old and building the new. The movement itself was a rousing feat with great cultural ramifications. The film itself is a work that sometimes trades in the grainy for flashy; rupturing not only the pattern that the authors were trying to break, but the whole tone of the film as well.",/review/rw3022439/?ref_=tt_urv

","I saw this film at the Ghent (Belgium) film festival 2013, where is was part of the official Competition. For a brief but scary moment I thought myself sitting in the wrong venue and deja-vu-ing The Perks Of Being A Wallflower, a movie highly praised all over, but I hated it from the beginning to the very end. I remember that I wanted to walk out at that time, but didn't for two reasons. One that I sat in the middle of a row in a fully booked venue. Second that I wondered the whole movie long what it could be that I overlooked, knowing its high praises from various reputable sources. Luckily I soon realized that this movie Kill Your Darlings is completely different, in spite of the fact that it also follows a university freshman and would-be writer. So from the outside my initial fear was justified.",/review/rw3022439/?ref_=tt_urv

","My review of Kill Your Darlings may be heavily bias because I have read everything I can get my hands on about the relationship between Ginsberg and Carr and I am a beat fan before almost many things. However, this film examines Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe) before he began his literary revolution and the character is one I found easy to fall in love with. Radcliffe portrays Ginsberg - with the aid of new comer writer and director John Korkidas - with a playful naive innocence as he approaches love and friendship at Columbia and his relationship between Carr (Dane DeHaan) is believable from the moment you see them in the same scene.

16 September 2019,classicsoncall,8," ""Welcome to the edge of the world!""
","If I had known this film was about some of the original members of the Beat Generation poets, I probably would have picked it up sooner. Oddly, the story never once mentions the word 'Beat' to describe them, instead opting for a term coined by Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe) that focused on 'The New Vision'. Somehow, this entire relationship between Ginsberg, William Burroughs (Ben Foster), Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston), and Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan) occurred well below my radar when I became interested in some of the writings of Kerouac. But that was in the early Seventies, well past the era in which this story took place. If one isn't ready for it, virtually anything by Burroughs and Ginsberg is so outlandish as to be unreadable and incomprehensible. However the story here is amazingly true to the facts of what occurred regarding the death of David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall), though certain critics will disavow Kammerer's homosexuality and being a predatory stalker. For purposes of the film though, a lot of the facts regarding the relationship of these men to each other and how they reacted to David's death is handled extraordinarily well. One slight omission, even though it was mentioned that Kerouac's girlfriend Edie Parker (Elizabeth Olsen) was set to receive an inheritance and decided to use that money to bail out Kerouac who was arrested as an accessory to Kammerer's murder, a stipulation in the will stated that the money wouldn't be released until she was married. They did get married in New York's City Hall, with Kerouac handcuffed to a detective!",/review/rw3022439/?ref_=tt_urv
