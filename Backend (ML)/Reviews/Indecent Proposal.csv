20 September 2020,EPMD57,6," Frustratingly disorganized and drawn out
","There is a lot of good footage, audio recordings, and interviews that help tell the story. The subject matter is fairly interesting, and I do think it's a story worth telling. The problem is that it's disorganized and could use a heavy edit.",/review/rw7750826/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2020,helenahandbasket-93734,8," A Beginners Guide To Grooming
","This is precisely how skilled manipulators groom their victims- they'll prey on your weaknesses, pump you full of confidence to rip it out from under you, tell you you're special/outstanding then do a 180 and proclaim you to be stupid/weak/a follower.",/review/rw7750826/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2020,bogus-bogus-one,6," Too much filler
","Painfully slow to watch due to all the repetition and ""filler"" scenes.
I'm convinced that the series should edited down to two or three episodes at most.
It's is definitely an interesting topic so my advice.. record everything, fast forward as needed.",/review/rw7750826/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2020,theknownames,8," Current events
","This was necessary, I am on episode 8 and I can see why some people feel this has been dragged out , but is it ? No; the point is that these people are still in this and it's all about the how , how they got there happen.
How can this happen to sophisticated people with resources. I don't feel it's been stretched out , in fact, the issue for me is binge watching which creates tedium ( it's probably why it's been released weekly)
Anyone who walks away thinking it can't happen to them had missed the point imo. This is happening now the fallout is current events , it's no tiger king this involves thousands of people across the globe and i am not expecting resolution by episode 9. I am hopeful but I believe this was meant to take us in the journey of how they got to where that are and the frustrations and obstacles of getting out . There are still people in right now .

28 September 2020,ajae-54401,5," Should have been a four-episode series
","Too many episodes... They made 10 ""ok"" episodes instead of making four really good episodes that had just enough coverage and length.. Instead, it kind of drags on and doesn't really grab me as much due to the repetitiveness of it. It's still pretty good, mainly due to the large collection of recorded calls, but it could have benefited from more brevity.",/review/rw7750826/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2020,paul-allaer,7," New documentary series examines cult-like organization NXIVM
","As Episodes 1 of ""The Vow"" (2020 release; 9 episodes of about 60 min. each) opens, we get to know Keith Raniere, who talks about ""optimizing people's experience and behavior"". We go to ""2017"" as a guy named Mark confesses that""I was afraid to be attacked if I left the organization"", and then the shocking headline as we go to ""2019"" where Keith Raniere is convicted of sex trafficking. We then go back in time as we get to know Sarah, who meets Mark on a cruise and they hit it off, big time. Mark convinces Sarah to take the organization's (called NXIVM) initiation program (called Executive Success Program). Sarah is skeptical at first but soon finds herself fully on board... At this point we are 10 min. into Episode 1.",/review/rw7750826/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2022,Klaaatu,10," Second season way better than the first season
","Although I found the first season interesting, I agree with most of the reviewers that it was way too long and drawn out - and very repetitive. They should redo that season and rerelease it to live up to the second season.",/review/rw7750826/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2021,chron,5," Interesting Story, but an Editing Failure

15 September 2020,tylerwoodrownichols,5," Squandered potential, bogged down by tedium
","As usual, too many people on here are leaving ratings based on a.) how interesting the source material is, or b.) their personal feelings about the cult and people who participated in it. Those feelings are valid, but not really what IMDB is for. Instead, I prefer to focus on the quality of the documentary itself and HOW the story is delivered.",/review/rw7750826/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2020,carlos_carpio,3," Unbearably stretched out
",It's a solid good story but it would have been best to tell it in a more dynamic way in 90 minutes or 2 hours max. The desire to turn this into 9 episodes Is poor storytelling and just makes it unbearable to watch after the third episode.,/review/rw7750826/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2020,brewcorp,10," Fascinating
",I read a lot of the NDA reviews complaining how this series was drawn out into 9 episodes and should've been much less but I disagree.,/review/rw7750826/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2021,quaseprovisorio,8," it maybe seems disjointed at times, but i really enjoyed it
","Its true that the series sometimes repeats itself and its not very chronological accurate, but i actually didnt care i enjoyed all the episodes. I never find it boring for one second, and believe me when i find something boring i never insist. I liked the fact that they gave time for everyone to tell their story. They were relly concerned with having the most ""pawns"" as possible.",/review/rw7750826/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2020,nyobatusa,10," excellent insight to a cult - authentic recorded conversations
","This is such a great documentary for the fact that we are able to see and hear the recorded conversations thanks the brilliant mind and intution of one member. The South African guy and the Australian girl his wife. Now it is not a coincidence I think that those people were first that saw something fishy going on in there. They are not Americans. The reason I say that is because they might have a bit of different perspective on ideas and values in a society. Regardless of stupid reviews complaining the show has too many episodes or that they are too drawn out, they missed the whole point. My take is the opposite. They actually capture the insight and process of the many many years of people's lives. They are supposed to be long that was the point of the documentary. Thanks to the evidence the leaders were brought to justice. There are many crime shows and movies on cults and religious groups how they manipulate and brainwash victims that seemingly voluntarily keep on being stuck. This document shows why.",/review/rw7750826/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2020,maanikroda,7," NXIVM is different in that, on the surface, it appeals much more directly to the intellect
","The story of NXIVM is massive. It's impossible for every notable detail to make the final cut. That said, there are some omissions that seem significant. For example, investigative journalist Frank Parlato, who has written extensively about NXIVM over the years, is mentioned in early episodes and characterized as someone who isn't always viewed as credible. But in the seventh episode, Parlato becomes a supporting figure in the series as he helps actress Catherine Oxenberg, whose daughter India refuses to leave NXIVM, in her attempt to get law enforcement involved in the situation. Given all the evidence Parlato has compiled and his willingness to help, he comes across as semi-heroic, albeit eccentric. A visit to his website, the Frank Report, reveals that it's filled with reporting on NXIVM but also posts written by Roger Stone and at least one defense of QAnon, a juxtaposition that caused so much cognitive dissonance in my brain that it turned into a popping-confetti cannon. While it's understandable that Noujaim and Amer decided that a whole sidebar on Parlato would be too distracting, this still raises the question of what other notable information or nuances may have been sliced out of the series.",/review/rw7750826/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2020,revchristodd,10," How Smart People Find Themselves in Cults
","Usually when you see documentaries on cults, you get the weird stuff first and it makes it hard to understand how people get into these things. This documentary series brings you into NXIVM as you would if you were discovering it as an interested person, and then a new member, and you get deeper into it before you start learning about the really bizarre stuff, just as the people featured in this series did. Created by 2 extremely clever people, one of whom is a nurse and counselor, the insights NXIVM offered folks are attractive, helpful and at least partially true. For the first time I could see how an intelligent person could get caught up in this. It helps that rather than getting just talking heads looking back on the events, this features a wealth of material from a filmmaker who became the organization's person in charge of media. So we see things as they happened, we get clips from their official training videos, we get interviews with the cult leader and can see firsthand his charm and subtle manipulations. And we get recordings of actual phone calls where people are not always as guarded. We see the gradual dawning on the higher ups who are the focus of this series as they confront just what they have let themselves get enmeshed in. If you've ever wondered how smart people could possibly find themselves in a cult, this will help you understand those who get taken in by plausible lies fashioned by subtly manipulating psychological truths.",/review/rw7750826/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2020,horst69,1," Guilty pleasure
","I give it a 1/10 , but I enjoy watching it .",/review/rw7750826/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2020,sebwilliams,6," Thorough but unfocused
","While the series has plenty of recorded phonecalls, recordings and interviews with people who were involved with - and since escaped - the organisation, the series lack of proper pacing trips it up. There is no straight timeline being followed, but instead it steadily introduces more people and might then go back to previous events we have already seen because these newly introduced figures were also involved in that. This leads to topics switching quite randomly. As such the series might struggle to hold your attention past your innate interest in seeing where things go in the end. In conclusion the series seem to portray events accurately enough, however it meanders too much and doesn't have a defined 'thread' you can follow that will keep you in suspense. I would put this slightly above average 6 episodes in.",/review/rw7750826/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2020,editing_budgie,1," This is raw footage, not a documentary

7 October 2020,FIoret,8," Before you watch this documentary be aware the filmmaker's are former members as well.
",Update after watching season 2: I changed my orginal rating of 5 to a 8 after watching the second season. This season presents a more balanced view of the group. Specifically Nancy's contributions. She's a complex woman. Obviously very smart but naive when it came to judging Keith's character and actions. I hope her and the rest of the women interviewed are able to one day move past Keith. To trust their instincts and not depend on others to feel worthwhile. To feel accomplished and loved. Keith preyed upon their fears and weaknesses. I'm happy he was stopped before he could ruin additional lives. How others can continue to support him after knowing what he did to Camila and her sister is disturbing.,/review/rw7750826/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2020,mTopoMax_deleted,8," It get worse...much worse
","If any of our millennial reviewers (in residence) believe that the people who got caught in NXIVM's web are stupid or simply bourgeois people in need of a hobby-think again!
Either some of the viewers have been asleep for the past ten years (NXIVM was all over the media and the subject of a year-long podcast about a year ago) or so, or simply have the empathy of a Social Media Influencer.
However the first episode shows NXIVM in a light that is mostly benign that anyone judging (as WASPy really??) the participants has to be mean spirited or uneducated.",/review/rw7750826/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2021,b4blue,10," As long as it should be
","Yes. It is very long. This is good, because in order to understand, you need to go beyond dry info. The way this was presented enabled me to understand (not fully, of course) how the protagonists felt and why they allowed everything to happen, the way it did. It could happen to anyone. The show does not serve you everything on a plate. Protagonists that were directly involved are still left with sense of shame and a lot of questions into why, but you have to get that answer yourself Their experience is only theirs, but you have to look into your mind and see the patterns that could have led you down the same path.",/review/rw7750826/?ref_=tt_urv
