27 July 2022,pranayjalvi,5," Mediocre Spy Thriller
","Two solid hours of efficient Netflix content is what's on offer here, the action-thriller equivalent of emptiness with nothing but cliche thrillers and mediocre action.",/review/rw8358371/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2022,lovemichaeljordan,7," It's not bad, but 200mil USD should produce more, right?
","It doesn't look like a cheap movie, but no chance that this movie had over two hundred million dollars in budget. It's a decent and enjoyable movie but it shouldn't cost that much. Spend your money on better things instead of this easily consumed but entertaining film. Companies like Netflix and Disney keep producing mediocre content when they have insane budgets. Do they spend every penny on the CGI and hire children to do the writing? The writing in Gray Man is not bad, but maybe we should expect more when they have an almost unlimited budget?",/review/rw8358371/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,deanbean317,3," I was happy when it ended!
","This movie started off okay, some clever dialog, some good action scenes still grounded in reality, (you know, where Newton's laws still apply), and some very creative camera angles. Then, as usually happens, it turned into a Roadrunner/Wilie Coyote cartoon. Humans became superhumans, injuries, no matter how numerous and serious, never slowed our protagonist and one man bested armies. This was so bad...I GUARANTEE a sequel!",/review/rw8358371/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2022,imseeg,4," Another mediocre Jason Bourne copycat. The story is completely silly, but even worse the action is laughably stupid as well.
","Another Jason Bourne copycat and a really mediocre one at that. Why is it mediocre? Because of a mediocre silly story and lots of mediocre supporting actors, who usually only star in tv series.",/review/rw8358371/?ref_=tt_urv

23 July 2022,IonicBreezeMachine,7," It may not be the ""Bond killer"" I'm sure the producers were hoping for, but The Gray Man is a solid action thriller that delivers.
","Court Gentry (Ryan Gosling) is a man serving a lengthy prison sentence for murder when he's approach by CIA Donald Fitzroy (Billy Bob Thorton). Fitzroy impressed by Gentry's lethal skills and lack of familial connections offers him recruitment into the Sierra program, wherein convicted felons agree to work for the CIA as deniable off the books assets who can ""operate in the gray"" in exchange for commuted sentences, which Gentry accepts taking the designation Sierra Six (""Six"" for short). 18 years later Gentry continues to operate for the CIA as the last member of the Sierra program much to the ire of Denny Carmichael (Regé-Jean Page) who has succeeded Fitzroy in position and voices disdain for Fitzroy's tenure including the Sierra program. When an assassination in Bangkok assigned to Six reveals his target was Sierra Four, Four gives Six an encrypted drive that was Carmichael's true objective and this sends Six into the wind. Carmichael seeking to retrieve the drive before it can be decrypted enlists the aid of sociopathic private contractor and former CIA assassin Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans) to take down Six and retrieve the drive and Hansen issues a bounty on Six that sends every assassin after Six. Additionally Hansen takes hostage Six's now retired mentor Fitzroy as well as Fitzroy's niece Claire (Julia Butters) to ensure Six has no allies.",/review/rw8358371/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2022,krzysiektom,5," Mediocrity.
","Mediocre. The script and dialogues are really poor, they needed more polishing and talent. Acting is mediocre or weak, everybody's just doing their usual shtick, without much effort. Special effects are weak too, like in a tv series. The fights are choreographed and shot well. All in all, yet another big budget and big stars Netflix adventure that is a forgettable let down, mainly because of a very dumb script.",/review/rw8358371/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2022,Joshumms,8," Finally a Great Netflix Action Movie
",Netflix finally made a good high budget action movie that strays away from the high budget action comedies with middle of the road action and comedy they have been making like Red Notice and The Man From Toronto. All this movie needed was great action and enjoyable character performances and a serviceable story and it delivers. The action in this movie can range from a little choppy to very slick but it's overall really good. Chris Evans as a villainous maniac is absolutely amazing to watch and Ryan Gosling and Ana De Armas are simply bad asses. Definitely worth seeing in the theater rather than Netflix.,/review/rw8358371/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2022,yannik_kng,4," ""The gray man"" or ""Why money is not everything""
","To start with something positive: The movie looks good, the production quality is high, i like the drone shot although they are totally unnecessary. The fight in the end is good. Sadly, that's it, more or less.",/review/rw8358371/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2022,masonsaul,5," Disappointingly mediocre
","Considering the huge budget, cast and previous talent of the filmmakers, the fact that The Gray Man is thoroughly average is extremely disappointing. An action thriller that does nothing new and doesn't even play the greatest hits in a particularly memorable fashion.",/review/rw8358371/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,Bonitao,7," Enjoy.
","Unfortunately, before seeing the movie I saw some reviews and critics who criticized the movie a lot, classifying it as shallow, meaningless and so on. Obviously it's not a masterpiece of action movies and doesn't come close to Bourne or 007, however, it still manages to be a good movie, the plot is a little cliché and shallow has secondary plots that don't go deep and for me in that, the movie falls short. The action scenes have a lot of cuts which honestly takes the excitement out of the scene. The various locations, despite enhancing the film in terms of photography, are very beautiful.",/review/rw8358371/?ref_=tt_urv

","This was fun and action packed! Had some great one liners too. I haven't seen Ryan Gosling in a minute, I'm glad he's back! Chris Evan was great, he delivers his comedic a lines with as much force and his punch. I say it's a fun, high octane way to spend 2 hours.

","Speak for yourself you might say - my Thursdays are quite different. Hey, I'm with you! Mine are also quite different. Also I don't remotely look like Ryan Gosling - especially not when you consider the one scene where he takes of his shirt (depending on what you like, you may find that arousing or abhorent I reckon, but I can't even imagine what he had to go through to get that ... physique - no pun intended) ... just saying.",/review/rw8358371/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie is horrible.

Terrible. Every cliche on Earth. Ugh.",/review/rw8358371/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2022,radhrh,1," Another Netflix fail.
","I'm honestly quite surprised that there are writing credits for The Gray Man. Even more astounded that it's an adaptation from a book. A top CIA assassin finds out something he shouldn't and is then chased round the globe by the CIA's number 2 assassin. That's it, that's as much plot as you get. Not exactly ""Tinker, Taylor, Soldier, Spy"" is it? Even though it's aimed at the action spy thriller market and is a Bond/Borne wannabe it fails to live up to even those franchises limited narrative depth. So what we have is a series of very frantic action sequences with not much to link them together. I became bored after the first hour and watched a documentary about base jumping dogs instead. No, really.",/review/rw8358371/?ref_=tt_urv

24 July 2022,ecsecs-91225,," Awful..
","I'm not going to make specific comments about the movie and spoil the fun, ALL the other 1-3 star reviews have thoroughly taken care of that. I'm here to state it's blatantly obvious the film industry is trending downwards at full speed. Even with an all star cast, proven directors, and an ample budget, this was the best they could do? What's most alarming are the 8-10 star ratings for a movie that nothing more than cut and paste of random fights, shoot outs, character decision making devoid of logic, and very predictable absurd action sequences. We'll never get back to the days of not being required to completely shut off our brains ""start to finish"" in order to enjoy a movie.",/review/rw8358371/?ref_=tt_urv

25 July 2022,classicsoncall,7," ""We're going to train you to kill bad guys.""
","If what you're looking for is unrestrained, over the top action, then this movie is for you. It's got the requisite chases, gunfights, and explosions, along with a James Bond style exit from a doomed airplane in which the hero, in this case
Ryan Gosling, parachutes to Earth after dispatching a crew of mercenaries originally hired to extract him from danger. Gosling is Sierra Six, released from prison eighteen years earlier upon the request of CIA operative Don Fitzroy (Billy Bob Thornton) in exchange for his life as an off the grid, untraceable assassin. With the usual handful of double crosses and expected twists, Six runs an international gamut of hit-teams and mercenaries to continually thwart his primary foe Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans), who's disregard for the usual norms of covert government agencies earned him the contract to take out Six. But come on, you know that wasn't going to happen right from the start, whether or not you've seen a few dozen of these types of pictures. A back story involving Fitzroy's niece (Julia Butters) is also in play, adding to the unenviable task of Six keeping an encrypted disc out of the hands of his formidable adversary. The finale is fairly predictable, but at the same time the film felt unfinished with the fates of several players in question. Ana de Armas and Alfre Woodard provide additional star power in support of Gosling's misadventure as Sierra Six, and to top it off, he doesn't even have to wear spandex.",/review/rw8358371/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2022,geister_faust,4," Nothing new
",The problem with action movie reviews is that people tend to overestimate insignificant movies like that while labeling them as 'good fun' and that drags entire genre to the bottom like an outlier in a non-weighted average. Action movies don't need to be 'simple' or 'dumbed down'. There are great action flicks over decades that are praise-worthy and some of them are even defining sub-genres of their own like Heat or Bourne series and some are just standing alone like Ronin or John Wick and ageing like a good wine.,/review/rw8358371/?ref_=tt_urv
