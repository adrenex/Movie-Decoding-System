17 May 2021,tsroque,5," Had High Hopes
","I had such high hopes for this film. I seriously don't think basketball scholarships are the #1 issue for Asian families. Would have been more believable if the parents were against Boogie's dream to play ball, but instead, Boogie was just a good player...not the best with family struggles.",/review/rw6974893/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2021,sue-534,6," Lead actor and actress too old to play High School kids.
","I thought the story was very good and it kept me interested. I like sports movies in general and movies from and about lots of other cultures. I had two issues with this movie: The actor and actress who played Boogie and Eleanor are 28 and 30 years old and didn't look like H. S. kids at all - not even close. The 2nd issue was with the ending and all the closeups of the eyes, I thought it was overdone.",/review/rw6974893/?ref_=tt_urv

",This film tells a story that is best understood under a lens of an understanding of the Chinese culture. It is an engaging story.,/review/rw6974893/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2021,iboso64,3," Dreadful and dull = Dreadfully dull
","The camera crew knew what they were doing. It's well-shot, I'll give it that much. The writing it bad, the direction is bad. I'm assuming Eddie Huang either has money, or knows people with money, because that's the only way slop like this gets financed. The lead is sullen, almost everyone is unappealing, and there's zero tension. Even the clich√©d final game lacks any sort of suspense. It's clear that the only reason this got a theatrical release is the pandemic has made theaters desperate for product and better films still want to make some money, so they're waiting. This is filler. Wait for it to show on some streaming service, then skip it.",/review/rw6974893/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2021,shoeis,1," Zzzz
","The basketball scenes were terrible, the outdoor basketball rims were barely nine foot to allow the actors to dunk. The main characters are supposed to be high school age yet they look like they are late 20's at best. The love story was a joke. Boogie says he loves her, but he has or shows no passion for the girl, or for anything else other than complaining or sulking. Very disappointing.",/review/rw6974893/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2021,ilikemovies2323,7," Could've been better. Could've been much worse.
","While for the most part Boogie may seem like a tonally confused, mess of a film, I find it to be more or less saved by its incredible amount of passion, great characters, and the few good actors that portray them. Especially Taylour Paige whose performance is as good if not better than her's in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. Can't wait for Zola.",/review/rw6974893/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2021,Eggoreluckadman,7," Good coming of age movie
","Exactly what you expect in a coming of age film but with the style and substance of asian culture and director Eddie Huang's perspective. Good performances as well from the entire cast. Only issue I had was the ending felt anticlimactic and a very ""Hollywood"" ending",/review/rw6974893/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2021,sheriefryan,5," Definitely had its moments, but shallowness of the plotline made the film end up being average.
","I was excited to see this film, what attracted it to me was seeing Pop Smoke on the trailer but learning the story and seeing how climatic the trailer was especially about the story and the life of a Basketball player challenging Asian stereotypes to be just mathematicians or restaurant owners etc... and actually taking up a sport mostly dominated in America by anyone but Asians. I especially enjoyed seeing a contemporary Asian narrative (in this case, Chinese) because of their underrepresentation in the media. On the one hand I really liked Boogie's father who was hard and tough on Boogie but was always supportive, despite the challenges he is facing as a father and a husband, while being on parole. I love the support he showed towards his son. However I feel like the rivalry between Monk and Boogie should have been explored better, especially considering how they have both been with the same woman, Boogie's challenges knowing that the one person who he sees as a threat especially in the sport which is mostly his entire livelihood has laid with the person he loves. And also the girlfriend showing her independence and taking the step to make sure that their relationship doesn't fall apart. Monk barely appeared in the story, and could have played more of a prominent role altogether. All of this was filmed months before Pop Smoke passed away, so there is no excuse.",/review/rw6974893/?ref_=tt_urv

3 April 2021,gurjotgill,10," LOVED IT!
",Great movie! (Ft. Pop Smoke) Been following Eddie Huang since the tv series Fresh off the Boat. It's a coming of age story of an Asian American trying to make his own way.,/review/rw6974893/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2021,alvaromedina-13897,10," It gives a inside view of the culture of an Asian American
",I really enjoyed the movie! Sure it wasn't filled with drama like other sport movies but it really portrays a good insight on Asian American culture and the struggles they face with traditions. I would highly recommend you watch before believing the reviews!,/review/rw6974893/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2021,ks-60500,2," Please cast probably
","Finding someone look like 40s and act a college boy, come on......are you kidding me? I can't fit in the drama at all by his look. The leading actor literally a 30s adult, aren't there any younger actor to pick ? Lame lane lame. For those Chinese, speak not traditional Chinese at all, come on, aren't there any better actors to pick???? This movie have serious casting issues, don't treat audience stupid.",/review/rw6974893/?ref_=tt_urv

","Alfred Chin (Taylor Takahashi ) is a Chinese-American who wants a basketball scholarship so he can play in the NBA. He has some discipline issues plus colleges typically do not Asians basketball scholarships, but he is welcomed as a walk on. His immediate goal is to beat Monk (Pop Smoke) the top city player. Chin also has a girlfriend and a best friend to help him sort out 5,000 years of Chinese history all laid on his shoulders.",/review/rw6974893/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2021,susanlchallis,3," Messy, boring, slow, not sure how I ended up at this movie
","The main character was flat, boring, came across as angry, pretentious, obnoxious, and you didn't emphasize with him at all. Very little character development.",/review/rw6974893/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2021,calicut110,6," Well done
",Nothing earth shattering but it's a nice coming of age story. Especially targeted at the Asian American experience. The lead did well and so was his girlfriend. I think it could have had a little more clarity in the end but outside that I was entertained.,/review/rw6974893/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2021,Jeff_34,," Asian Hip Hop Hoops
",Asian Hip Hop Hoops. Could it have been better? Sure but watch it as an underground indie thang and then you can appreciate it better. It feels like none of these cats are trained actors and you know what? Why not. It has a story that is worth telling. Learn more about other cultures everyone. (PS. too bad none of these guys are hoopers but... ;),/review/rw6974893/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2021,aaronkimj,10," I liked it
",It wasn't trying to be some epic tale or some feel good cheesy film. Alfred had good composure for the part and the editing made the line delivery and story pacing feel smooth. I also liked that the film was short and doesn't spend excess time in unnecessary subplots.,/review/rw6974893/?ref_=tt_urv

","I like Fresh Off the Boat. I like Eddie Huang on Vice. I did not like this movie. It started off ok, but soon got cheesy and downright terrible. The best scene was when the dad arrived home and caught his wife discussing their son's future with the agent. Now why a wife would invite an agent home like that without anyone there is beyond me. But, at least it was tense. The dynamic between the main character and Black chick was ok. Surprised that he's tuff throughout the movie, then when it came to sex he was insecure lmao I guess it's character development. There was zero tension between the main guy and Pop Smoke. It was just too forced and there was no development for that. I guess it just set up for the cliched basketball game ending where all problems are solved by winning the game. THAT entire sequence was filmed and edited very badly. I actually laughed out loud when, after the coach yelled at the main character for causing problems at their school game, he suddenly showed up and coached at the tournament game. What?? Poo Smoke was pretty much there to look and sound evil, and get extreme closeups of him grilling the camera or something. Hey, I would've hit a fat paycheck to do that too. Eddie Huang you are the man for Fresh Off the Boat and your Bice specials but this could've been way better.",/review/rw6974893/?ref_=tt_urv

",Just watch the trailer. That's all you need to know about this movie and where it's going.,/review/rw6974893/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2021,felixtr,9," It really connects.
","For an asian growing up outside of Asia, this really connects. Can also see many parts of the movie was probably from Eddies own experiences. I think this movie is many times better than ""Crazy Rich Asians"" that everybody loves. This is a hidden gem.",/review/rw6974893/?ref_=tt_urv
