",It came full circle. I had alot of burning questions from the first season and when i heard they renewed it i was ecstatic. This is the perfect ending so please don't ruin it with a third season.,/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2020,ahmedgorshy,10," The greatest absurd Show
","Watch this show if you want a frivolous, light crazy comic story that you can watch in one session. This is what I want. This offer deserves to be included in the imdb list. It is my favorite show in 2017.",/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2018,GraXXoR,10," Compulsive, binge viewing required.
","From the first five minutes, I was hooked. And I was hook line and sinkered into thinking it was going to be a teenage angst road movie! Not so!
The entirely Adult theme, off kilter storyline and the entirely believable yet totally surreal characters draw you inwards and downwards on an inescapable maelstrom of a tale that forces you to care about the protagonists and their all too tragically inevitable fate.",/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2019,skylarschmdt,8," Watched It All In A Day
","A different kind of show where two unfit kids go on an adult adventure. One of the few shows that was odd enough to keep my attention and making me watch episode after episode until I had realized I just spent the whole weekend finishing this series. For people looking for something more gritty and new, I'd recommend this as a watch.",/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 2019,vindstilla,9," When silence really speaks to you
","Loved it. Was kind of skeptical in the beginning of season one but quickly it grew on me. Season two I binged watch in one afternoon, and now I'm sad I didn't save some of it for later! I love how this show is dark without being overly creepy. I love how the dialogue is sparse and the silence really speaks to me. No grand gestures needed in the acting, which is very held back and understated in an honest but still kind of funny way. You can feel a lot of things happening under the blank and quiet surfaces of the main characters faces while the bizarre plot is developing. Great storytelling.",/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2018,jonnyrottenappleseed,10," Great show.
","Its not edgy, cliche, or funny really. It tackles real issues of attachment and abandonment in a world full of people that glorify narcissistic tendencies. The growth of the characters is gradual but real in just one season. It has comedic writing without being overall condescending to any one thing in particular.",/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2019,whatithinkis,10," What an stunning surprise
","I too thought: what! Season 2? No WAY . . . just leave the perfection that season 1 was, as is. Let it be. I read the reviews here, and despite a hint or two, was unprepared for the NEW perfection of season 2. Wow.",/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2018,bhojrajsapkota-63235,9," One of the best Netflix TV series
",This is one the best Netflix series out there. This is the story about a psychopath James who fakes his love for Alyssa so he can kill her however after staying with her he start to connect with her. The TV series has a good plot with good acting skills also the music is super good as well. Highly recommended it watching also it can get addictive.,/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2017,iamchrisallan,10," Fantastic
","We binged this one. We just couldn't stop watching. There is so much that is wonderful about this drama. Excellent writing and acting. The locations and sets are uniquely fabulous. It doesn't feel like a British TV drama, more like an American road movie. Great pacing. A wonderful mix of humour, darkness and pathos. Truly fantastic.",/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2019,a_mobbs,10," Watched it in one sitting
","I absolutely love this series, as much as I loved the first. The lead actors delivery of their lines - bewildered, angry, sad, and happy (but only happy once or twice) contributed to their excellent performances. Utterly gripping, utterly brilliant.",/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2020,deloudelouvain,9," Brilliant!
","What a great short series this was! I binge watched the whole thing in a couple of days, that wasn't too difficult as each episode only last about twenty minutes and the entertainment level was very high. Not only was the story very well written but the acting of Jessica Barden and Alex Lawther was on top. The quirky relationship they had, the weird chemistry there was between them was a delight to watch. The very thick accent of Jessica Barden added something very special to the atmosphere of the story. The End Of The F***ing World might only be two short seasons long but it's a great show, the kind you wished they made more of. Definitely a show I recommend and that I will watch again in the future.",/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2017,MrOpinionated,10," Deserves the awards probably won't get.
","So much of today's TV is puerile and childish. This most certainly is among the Best of British TV. I fear that it's title will prevent it from awards though. After a good 53 years of watching screens, this stands proud as an example of what you can do if you have true talent. I look forward to seeing what all involved have to come...",/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2017,djcatsgc,9," Weird
","Well have just finished watching all 8 episodes. I can see the audience , young (me 60), that the producers were aiming at . However if you like your stories in the K Dick / Missfits, style then you will enjoy this. I have given it a 9 /10 rating as there were a couple of ""odd"" occurrences, that I will not elaborate here, for they were minor and could spoil things. Give it a go.",/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2018,who_cares_about_the_IDs_here,5," I want this to be considered as great show
","Well, frankly it is easy to binge, short 8 episodes put online altogether. It feels a little bit weird kind of a ""chumscrubber"" or ""thumbsucker"" movie (if you're familiar with it) but a bit longer, with different story arcs of course. ",/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2021,lee_eisenberg,10," sociopathy the humorous way
","So far I've liked what I've seen of ""The End of the F***ing World"". These teens are essentially sociopaths, but the clever show has just the right touch to keep it in good taste (along with the complexity of the characters). With a cool soundtrack to boot, this is one show that you're bound to like.",/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv

",Couldn't stop watching this weird amazing thing thank you Netflix for this masterpiece,/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2019,apl670,10," Loved it
","I honestly don't know what it is about this show that utterly captivated me. I binged the first season in one go earlier this year and I often think about it. I had no idea there was a second season coming (it really had a ""stand alone"" feel) so got such a surprise when I opened Netflix earlier!! Queue second binge (and I'm not a binge watcher at all) and no chores done. Really enjoyed it! I was so worried they'd ruin it somehow, but I was transfixed yet again. Alyssa and James are played so amazingly, fantastic acting. I can appreciate it may be a love/hate kind of show for people. But for me it's one of the best things I've watched in ages. I think if you loved the first season you will love the second one too.",/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2017,beadybrent,10," Couldn't stop watching
","I've just watched the whole series in one go and I wish there were more episodes. The writing is fabulous - witty but naive, cruel but touching. ",/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2019,Tweekums,9," A gripping black comedy drama
",This series is centred on seventeen year olds James and Alyssa. James is convinced he is a psychopath and plans to kill somebody; when the rebellious Alyssa suggests they run away together it looks as if he has a victim. They set off and things don't go well. After one particular incident they find themselves wanted by the police and head to Alyssa's estranged father on the Isle of Sheppey. Here things come to a dramatic conclusion as series one comes to an end. The second series takes place two years later and introduces new character Bonnie who is just as troubled... I won't say more as that would require spoiling details of series one.,/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2018,technicolorkelly,10," Dark and beautiful (originally written in the Netflix reviews section)
","Spectacular. I started watching on a whim when I saw the Netflix banner and got so caught up that it's suddenly 5:00 AM and I just finished the finale. This is a younger version of Bonnie and Clyde except PLOT TWIST the crime has a reason and one of the protagonists is a would-be sociopath who sets out to kill the other. The acting is brilliant, the characters are brilliant, there are lesbian police detectives whose lesbien-ness isn't the main focus of their characters. What more could I ask for? I'm sure that people are going to complain about the romanization of violence/crime/anarchy or whatever, but I would argue that this show does exactly the opposite. Everything has consequence in this tragic tale, from the young protagonists' actions to the adults whose mistakes have irreversibly damaged the lives of their children and the people around them. The performances are stunning. I've only ever seen Alex Lawther in Black Mirror, but I look forward to his future projects. That dude has a long career ahead of him, and so does Jessica Barden. A side note: As someone in their late teens, its refreshing to see actors who actually LOOK like teens playing teens. Every other piece of media shows airbrushed adults in their mid twenties as the ""average teen"" and it gets exhausting (I can confirm that almost all of us look like baby eggs with faces, even as a freshman in college). This is dark, this is real, this is relevant, and this is beautiful. P.S. This is not a rigged Netflix review. I am ACTUALLY giving this 5 stars and I am writing it of my own volition. Peace out",/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2019,moofyieman,10," One one the best series I know
","This series is right up my alley.
Every character is somewhat off and therefore very interesting. I love how everybody's got issues and is both vunerable and capable.
The first series were more intense then the second but I can't stop watching Alyssa and James; I just love both of them.
The music, the beautiful songs tops it off.
They should make a series every year, that would be so much fun watching them growing older.",/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2018,WakeyBakey,8," Gets better as it goes
","As a guy in my early 30's, I'm sure I'm not the target audience for this. It seems like more of a teen-thing.
But, for me, this starts very strong. Interesting characters and a perfectly set up modern Bonnie and Clyde story.
Sadly it looses a lot of momentum once they decide to settle down for a few days. It gets all about feelings and understanding each other. I'm sure this helps some people to connect to either of the characters... But for someone who's past these ""What is life and what do I do?""-feelings, it's just too slow and boring to watch.",/review/rw4029971/?ref_=tt_urv
