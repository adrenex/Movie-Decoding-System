14 September 2020,TheTexasChainstoreManager,3," Not Wallander
","""Young Wallander"" has nothing to do with Wallander, so it's pretty obvious that the creators are trying to just use a pretty internationally recognizable name to sell this show. My guess: they probably changed the name because it couldn't stand on it's own legs, so they just slapped ""Wallander"" on a script that initially was something else and everything points at this. Wallander is nothing like the Wallander we know. The creators explain this as (sic)""He hasn't become that cynical person yet."" They're Swedes in ""Sweden"" (filmed in Lithuania, with mostly British actors) but they speak English to appeal to a wider audience. Wallander is young i recent time, which obviously isn't right. The creators explain this with (sic)""Well, you have to bend your imagination...""
If the show actually was about a young Wallander in the Swedish '70s, actually filmed in Sweden, it would've been a very interesting take on the character. But this?.. They could've called it ""Young Batman"" and tell us to use our imagination.",/review/rw6063472/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2020,pjdickinson-27822,7," An odd beast
",This is made by Yellow Bird UK and other than the lead actor who is Swedish the cast is British. It's also set in the present which means it serves as neither a prequel to the British or Swedish series. It's also not filmed in Sweden like the other series but in Lithuania. It's not a bad show but it just doesn't feel like Wallander.,/review/rw6063472/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2020,cdmllm,8," Integrity to consistency missing
","The fans of the previous two Wallander series that tuned in to Young Wallander are bound to be disappointed that the new series timeframe is not consistent with that of its predecessors. Adam Palsson is a good actor and does well carrying the lead in this presentation. In keeping with the first two series the timeframe would've had to be the 70's.......for those too young to know, cell phones were a good 20-30 years away. Young Wallander uses a smart phone, looks like an iPhone. They easily could've called this series something other than Wallander which would have in no way impacted the premise of the show. So why call it a Wallander where comparisons would obviously be made....except for reasons of drawing a ready made audience. I am watching this series independent of the lead character growing into the older version of Kurt Wallander.",/review/rw6063472/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2020,rmorgansjd,7," It was good until the end.
","The writers got lazy, and just ended the season abruptly. Very disappointed. But the acting and the storyline up until the last episode was really good. I still think I would watch it even with the disappointing ending because the storyline and the characters are really well done. I'm just disappointed with the ending.",/review/rw6063472/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2020,Supermanfan-13,8," Gritty, edgy detective show!
","I never read the books so I didn't really know what to expect from Young Wallander but I ended up liking it quite a bit. It's a gritty, edgy police detective show that will keep you entertained throughout the series!",/review/rw6063472/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2020,altereggo123,2," Woke, predictable, badly acted and unsatisfying. Wallander in name only.
","Set in present day Sweden, as others have noted, this cannot be Young Wallander, unless IKEA sells time machines. I don't seem much to connect the younger man to the old. Calling it Wallander seems like a marketing decision-easier than getting people to watch a brand new detective, I guess. Also, almost everyone speaks English, but it was nice of all of those British actors to pretend that they were in Malmo. The lead, who is actually Swedish, delivers a weird interpretation of Young Wallander. He speaks softly and breathlessly, always. I don't know what he's doing, but I wondered whether it's his real voice or an artistic decision. A Kenneth Branagh imitation? It sounded very affected. The characters and plot are the most disappointing elements of all. A black gang leader with a heart of gold. Desperate immigrants. White supremacists. Billionaire philanthropists. A dedicated cop bucking senior officials to get at the truth. When are screenwriters going to stop using this formula? Woke=predictable. The series seems to have set itself up for a season 2, which won't be on my watchlist.",/review/rw6063472/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2020,andrew_jakobs,6," barely ok..
","This is coming from having seen both the Swedish Wallander (Krister Henriksson) series (which is the best) and the UK Wallander (Kenneth Brannagh) series (which is also very good), and watched only one of the Swedish movies with Rolf Lassgård (as the others are hard to come by).",/review/rw6063472/?ref_=tt_urv

12 September 2020,mrfrane,4," Probably just a bad idea in the first place
","Leaving aside the notion of retconning a well-known Swedish character, set in the present, filmed in Lithuania with a cast of British actors, this just isn't very good and isn't remotely suspenseful. A youthful version of Wallander would presumably be reasonably intelligent but someone waving their hand and saying ""Poof! You're a detective!"" doesn't work when the writers trot out a remarkably clueless Swedish dude who can't take simple instruction. ""Do nothing to draw attention to yourself"" seems simple, and probably shouldn't have led to Kurt being beaten even more senseless by a giant drug dealer. Most everyone is pretty, I'll give them that. They may have relied on the CW for casting. I was hoping for something entertaining enough to see through to the end but I was just bored.",/review/rw6063472/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2020,jeanblackqueen,1," this is many things but one thing it is NOT is young Wallander
",This has nothing to do with Wallander. They merely used his name to hook people in. The people who made this had a cop show and couldn't sell it so they paid someone to be able to use the name Wallander.,/review/rw6063472/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2020,epost-20607,4," Bad and lazy writing coupled with glorification of gang related criminality
","This was bad, really bad.
Wallander keeps making stupid misstakes just for the sake of creating drama later on and thats lazy writing, something that i had hoped was behind us when it comes to TV-series these days.
The depiction of the Malmoe gang criminality also leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Especially with how things are in real life Malmoe these days.",/review/rw6063472/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2020,uni-404-263652,1," Not good
",Nothing to do with Wallander. Set in today not 1970's. Not even we'll done police/detective story. I drudged though the 4 episodes but should have heeded those who quit early.,/review/rw6063472/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2020,BeGerman,9," Adam Pålsson ...
","... who plays the young Wallander are the perfect cast. After seeing the first 4 episode I like his acting and first link to the Wallander from the original novels and Swedish TV show. That the show are based not in the 70s underline the actuality of the story and makes it more interesting.
We know the end of Wallander's life and I like the idea of how it all started.
More like other shows.",/review/rw6063472/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2020,gallagherkellie,5," Why bother having it set in Sweden?
","If you want to make a Swedish show, hire Swedish actors and have them speak Swedish. If you want to make an English show, set it in England. It's so frustrating that I had to stop halfway through episode one.",/review/rw6063472/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2020,vince.smith,1," Cultural appropriation.

3 September 2020,chriswhite-26622,6," Why in English so many Brits in the cast?
",I am a Brit but disappointed that this could not be made in Swedish and with a Swedish cast.,/review/rw6063472/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2020,emeliesweden,8," It's OK
","Being a Swede, I'm not overly excited with an English speaking Wallander, however it's still a decent series to spend your time with on a rainy day. But I would have enjoyed it better if it was in Swedish cause it's a Swedish character. Also for everybody who doesn't know, Sweden and Swiss are two different countries;) Not many non European people seems to know this.",/review/rw6063472/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2020,jwmson-15891,2," Young Wallander it isn't
",As others have said this is not a prequel to the excellent Wallander series. I'm a huge fan of Scandinavian noir and police series and just finished watching Before We Die which was very good and stars the same actor and so this was very disappointing for several reasons. Everything about this is turgid and the use of English but with a mishmash of accents is distracting and annoying.,/review/rw6063472/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2020,pfabrams3,8," Not the same Wallander but worth a watch
","I was hoping that this series would be set in the past like Endeavor/Morse but sadly, this is not going to tell us the moody, brooding backstory of Kurt Wallander. It is a little too modern for my taste, but we watched it anyway.",/review/rw6063472/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2021,crumpytv,1," Dreadful
","Definitely not Nordic Noir. What a disaster.
English speaking Swedish lead, Adam Pålsson (Before We Die/Moscow Noir/The Bridge), with a British cast. It just doesn't work.
Why not in Swedish with Swedish actors.
This incarnation of Wallander is not a patch on the forerunners and Adam Pålsson is just not convincing in the role. His whispered hoarse delivery made me think he had been watching too much Eastenders.
It had the feel of so many run-of-the-mill UK dramas.
Also, I felt uncomfortable at the portrayal of ethnic minorities/immigrants. i.e. Sterotypical low-life. Political correctness has gone too far I recent times, but they could have done with applying some to this production.
We ditched this after episode 2 which was boring and I just plain awful.",/review/rw6063472/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2020,Tweekums,7," More of a reboot than a prequel
","This series is centred on Kurt Wallander, a young police officer in the Swedish city of Malmo. One day he witnesses an horrific crime on the estate where he lives... a young man, with a Swedish flag painted on his face, has been tied up with tape over his mouth; another man removes the tape revealing a grenade which explodes seconds later. This leads to him being moved to the serious crimes unit. The crime leads to tensions rising as many seek to blame the migrant community; following leads will put Kurt in real danger and uncovering a variety of secrets.",/review/rw6063472/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2020,sas2014,6," The whole charm of wallander was him being an awkward Swed
","I loved wallander & hace seen all of his original Swedish series. The whole charm was his awkward yet brilliant character. Swedish culture, Their way of interaction, dark yet beautiful nature. Pål the Danish actor Playing wallander has done great danish roles But this one isn't a convincing character for him. Should have left it scandi cast & original Svensk language",/review/rw6063472/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2020,aemc-85169,1," Not a Young Wallander
",So disappointed on so many levels! It's set in present day so calling it Young Wallander is just silly. It's not even filmed in Sweden. Part of the beauty of the Wallander series was the location. Where are the Swedish actors? And lastly it has gratuitous violence. Not the cerebral show I expected.,/review/rw6063472/?ref_=tt_urv
