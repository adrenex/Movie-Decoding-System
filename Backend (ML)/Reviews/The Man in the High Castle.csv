16 August 2020,bob the moo,," Wonderfully self-destructive
","The first five minutes of Uncut Gems are bewildering and disruptive; it feels like you re thrown into the middle of something, can't quite hear what is going on, and feel the pressure of whatever situation we have just found ourselves. It continues from there with an intensity that is relentless. It does not make for an easy film, but it makes for an engaging one. It totally sells the sense of addiction and relentlessness of gambling - the highs it offers through the thrill of the chase and the elation of the win, but also the lows of the many downsides and loses.",/review/rw5673872/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2019,davidgiorgione,9," Pleasant surprise... wow...
","That was INTENSE. Decided to watch this after seeing this film pop up on so many ""2019 Top 10 movies"" lists and I couldn't be happier that I did. Adam Sandler absolutely killed it in this, I kept feeling confused at the choices he made but at the same time felt sorry for him.",/review/rw5673872/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2020,searchanddestroy-1,8," Adam Sandler looks like a kind of Jewish Al Pacino
","Some folks wrote that this movie was a mix-up of Marty Scorcese and Abel Ferrarra style and I think that's right. And Adam Sandler speaks, looks like, borrows every expression on the face from Al Pacino. I Don't know if the audiences have also noticed this but that's so obvious. Anyway, that's the kind of role, character that would have perfectly fit to Robert De Niro's co star in HEAT and the IRISHMAN. I like this uncut gem very much.",/review/rw5673872/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2019,Quinoa1984,8," ""You're the most annoying person I've ever known""
","They should hand out high-grade blood pressure meds to people going to see this after it ends. The major strength and in a way the slight weakness of Uncut Gems is how laser-focused the Safdies are in conveying total anxiety, stress and mania through this extreme act of full cinema SOUND (levels of acting and over-lapping dialog, that Vangelis-Blade-Runner-on-Steroids/Crystal Meth score, some of the cinematography and the tracking of the camera).",/review/rw5673872/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2021,witster18,9," You didn't give Deliverance 3 stars, did you?
","Personally, I find the more a film affects my feelings and emotions, the better(no matter the emotion). From Tobe Hooper's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", to ""Free Solo"", or even ""August Osage County""; films aren't simply bad because they make you uncomfortable. One could argue; the more uncomfortable, the more effective. This is the case with Josh and Benny Safdie's ""Uncut Gems"".",/review/rw5673872/?ref_=tt_urv

15 September 2019,kjproulx,10," An Intense Roller-Coaster
","It has been a fascinating ride watching the numerous ups and downs of Adam Sandler's career. From classic comedies like Happy Gilmore to great dramatic performances like Reign Over Me, he has proven time and time again that he is a very talented guy. The problem is that he has let himself fall out of the spotlight over the last ten years, simply due to the fact that he has been choosing some of the worst films of each year, on multiple occasions. In what might be the greatest performance he has ever given, Uncut Gems is his latest role that will be released this fall. After viewing this at the Toronto International Film Festival and giving it a little time to sink in, I can confidently say that this will end up being one of my favourite films of 2019 by year's end.",/review/rw5673872/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2019,gortx,," NOT an Adam Sandler movie -- a Safdie Brothers FILM
","UNCUT GEMS (2019). First things first. This is not an ""Adam Sandler movie"". Yes, he is the star and the focus of the advertising, but, this is very much a ""Safdie Brothers film"". Emphasis on ""film"". Benny and Josh Safdie are very much in love with the look and feel of the films of the 70s and 80s, in particular. But, as with GOOD TIME, they are not interested in doing a cutesy wink-wink homage. It's in their bones.
Sandler plays Howard, New York city jeweler who's also a full-time hustler. His marriage to Dinah (Idina Menzel) is falling apart, his gambling debts are piling up and he is facing health issues. He banks his future on an Ethiopian rock which houses the title valuables. Also involved are a two-bit floozy he's carrying on with (Julia Fox) and Boston Celtics legend Kevin Garnett - playing himself.
From the get-go, the Safdie Brothers (who also co-wrote with Ronald Bonstein) bring enormous energy and drive to the proceedings. Sandler starts at 11 and goes from there. Similarly, Daniel Lopatin's score is often mixed so high it becomes intrusive at times (the synth music itself isn't bad, sort of a retro blend of Vangelis and Jean-Michel Jarre). Darius Khondij's 35mm photography is both slick and gritty.
Director Yorgos Lanthimos (THE FAVOURITE) has remarked that UNCUT GEMS is like ""a Robert Altman film that was dipped in acid."" Altman's 1974 CALIFORNIA SPLIT certainly fits the time period and some of the themes. Of course, Altman was an original and as many of his admirers have found out over the years, overlapping dialogue and naturalistic atmosphere do not alone make an ""Altman film"" (Altman himself often enough failed to create the unique mood). UNCUT GEMS works because of the filmmaking brio and Sandler's driven performance. Still, at times, it seems to be trying too hard. It works best in the last act when the Safdies let the drama play out more. It's a good film, even if not quite up to GOOD TIME. But, hey, Celtics fans now know how Boston beat Philadelphia in that 2012 Playoff series!",/review/rw5673872/?ref_=tt_urv

17 December 2019,Top_Dawg_Critic,4," A stressful convoluted mess of nothingness
","How is this even a movie? For starters, who's idea was it to have a constant loud, atrocious, out-of-place and annoying score in almost every second of this film. Then putting a bunch of loud people in one room yelling, ignoring each other and talking nonsense, and call it a movie. This is the garbage daily workplace stress people want to avoid, not watch expecting to be entertained, but instead resort to drinking to settle down watching this stressful convoluted mess of nothingness. What was even the point of the traditional dinner with still non-stop annoying loudness and useless chatter? I get the writers are novice/newbs, but at least have a seasoned writer proofread this mess before it goes to action and viewers watch stunned for 135 mins wondering what they're watching, only to get a stupid ending. 4/10 all going to Sandlers great performance",/review/rw5673872/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2020,eddie_baggins,9," An unrelenting adrenaline rush of a film, Sandler's finest hour
","Breaking out with 2017 effort Good Time, directing duo Benny and Josh Safdie quickly became one of the most talked about up and coming filmmaking prospects in Hollywood, with their Robert Pattinson starring thriller showcasing a knack the brothers had for crafting a frenetic thriller filled with abundant energy and visuals, that if refined further, could create something truly special.",/review/rw5673872/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2020,tjs-73604,9," The noise is the point
","""His character was unlikable."" ""It's too loud."" ""It's tiring/stressful to watch.""
I fail to see anything of value in any of these critiques. If anything it proves that the director got exactly the response he wanted. It was tiring and loud and stressful and even now after watching it my blood pressure is high and my neck is taught with nerves, but that's literally the point. Not every film has to center on a conventionally attractive hero progressing towards his goal after a setback and consequently fixing whatever romantic issues they had. One of the moments that made me love this film even more was Howey's attempt to reconcile with his wife at Passover. For just a moment, they roped me into believing that this could be the classic Sandler movie turning point, where he grows as a person in some way and his significant other takes him back. He didn't get this chance here and I love the director for that. Instead of the generic turn around story, we got to see a natural end to his destructive tendencies. It may not be the feel good experience you went to the movies for, but that doesn't make it bad. I think watching at home is a good choice though. I had to take a break in the middle of the film, and that likely made all the difference in my ability to enjoy it.",/review/rw5673872/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2020,cardsrock,8," Pulse-pounding is an understatement
","Wow, what a ride. This wasn't the unbearable anxiety-fest that some are claiming, but it sure does invoke a lot of uneasiness throughout. The Safdie Brothers take you on a mesmerizing journey in the life of a gambling-addicted man in the Diamond District. Hopefully this puts to bed the idea that Adam Sandler isn't a good actor. He displays his incredible versatility and gives the performance of his career. I really loved the synth score used throughout and it greatly heightens the intensity at key moments. Uncut Gems is a shocking and stressful tour de force that is worthy of the praise heaped upon it.",/review/rw5673872/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2020,kosmasp,9," You think I'm funny?
","It took a couple of minutes to take the schtick Adam Sandler was doing here for real. I've seen him in serious movies before, but he is almost playing any of his comedic characters here. At least it seems like that in the beginning. He is all fired up, talking fast, looking funny and all that.",/review/rw5673872/?ref_=tt_urv

","The story starts in Africa, we see two miners chiseling out a piece of mud/rock that has beautiful old opal pieces imbedded.

20 June 2020,classicsoncall,7," ""I just hit big, very big!""
","I'm sure this film had a script and a screenplay, but it plays out more like the stream of consciousness ravings of an inveterate and compulsive gambler in the guise of jewel merchant Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler). I mean really, you have to ratchet up your concentration to a whole new level to follow the musings of Howard as he traverses the city streets of New York to ply his trade and make the one big score that will get him out of hock with an array of dangerous debt holders. Add to the mix the presence of NBA star Kevin Garnett, whose obsession with a hunk of unrefined black opal leads the principals on a frantic chase across the Big Apple. It almost sounds like a comedy, though it's anything but, as Howard and his cohorts play for high stakes in a game in which the highest one might be a matter of life and death. This is an uncharacteristic role for Sandler, allowing for a range of acting ability not in evidence in the types of lightweight comedies he generally appears in. Here he's living on the edge every minute of the day, in a high stakes world that threatens to blow up any minute. Eventually it does, but probably in a way you won't expect. Contrast this film with 2014's ""The Gambler"" with Mark Wahlberg, and they'll both convince you that there's no such thing as a safe bet.",/review/rw5673872/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2019,Turfseer,5," Sandler's frenetic caricature of a compulsive gambler becomes repetitious despite occasional moments of raw entertainment
","Adam Sandler finally gets to play a role different than the usual goody two shoes characters we've come to expect and some critics have already declared this is his ""breakout"" role. Sandler is Howard Ratner, basically a caricature of Jewish entrepreneur who runs a jewelry showroom in the Diamond District in New York City. The Safdie brothers (Joshua and Benjamin) are responsible for both the direction and the screenplay.",/review/rw5673872/?ref_=tt_urv

22 September 2019,ierenz,9," Sandler delivers a tour de force performance in one of the year's best films.
","The Safdie brothers are a masterful dark comedy creating a film that happily has one rooting for the bad guy. Ratner is in more ways than one despicable cheat; but he's also someone who can't assist but love the crowd. As his different systems become more complicated, Ratner's hole digs deeper and deeper.With the ideal combination of arrogance and nervous insecurity, Sandler portrays Ratner's reckless descent. He's the man who believes he's covered with all the corners ; but he's really hanging on by a lucky thread.The performance of Sandler fits completely into the natural and edgy filmmaking style of the Safdie brother. The siblings patiently build a narrative that is an unpleasant and riveting experience. The more turbulent the waters Ratner is swimming in, the more difficult it is for one to look away. In fact, Uncut Gems is a rare treasure, a thrilling and darkly funny film.",/review/rw5673872/?ref_=tt_urv

","45 minutes was all I could bear, that was more than enough, 45 minutes of shouting, poor direction, ridiculous script, annoying soundtrack, terrible acting. Anybody who rates this movie seriously needs to have a long hard serious look at themselves.
