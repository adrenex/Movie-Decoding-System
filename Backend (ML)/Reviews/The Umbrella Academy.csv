14 July 2013,StevePulaski,2," A lumbering, distasteful comedy that has a lower impression of you than you have of it
","There I sat, in stone-cold silence, not completely watching, but observing Grown Ups 2, one of the most desperate comedies of the year. Smiling maybe twice, groaning several times, rolling my eyes several more, and eventually closing them for a few seconds trying to imagine what a movie like this could've been if the quality of the talent matched the quality of the three screenwriters behind this project.",/review/rw3402614/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2013,dcorvino,1," I was embarrassed to be seen at this movie
","How can I fully express my total disappointment in this film? It may not be possible. I am one of those who actually liked the first Grown Ups. It had a plot, good characters and lots of fun. The sequel, on the other hand, is pointless, stupid, juvenile, and insulting. Not one redeeming quality in the entire movie. I contemplated leaving after the first 15 minutes! I forced myself to stay just to see if this mess would get any better. It didn't. The jokes concern nude men, homosexual men, brainless women, sex, bodily functions (over and over again!), and more of the same, repeatedly. No story, no acting, no thought, no point. I was the first one out of the theater and never looked back.",/review/rw3402614/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2013,Alex_Hodgkinson,1," Is this classed as a film? How can it be classed as a film?
","Grown Ups was alright in my opinion. I tend to enjoy almost any film that is thrown in my direction for some reason or another. Grown Ups had a few laughs which put the label of 'Alright' on it. Below average, but watchable.",/review/rw3402614/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2013,final-fantasyxcjo,1," A Terrible movie thats TERRIBLE!
","Sandler's first sequel, is even lazier, dumber, and even less funny then I could have imagined. It's worse than most comedy sequels, and worse then most movies period. It's worse than Grown Ups, for heaven's sake! There's no plot, none, zip, nada. Characters and gags are set up without payoff much like in Jack and Jill. Almost every attempt at a joke falls flat. Anyone who wants to make a comedy should watch Grown Ups 2 as an example of one that does almost everything wrong and what to and what not to do when directing and making a mainstream comedy.",/review/rw3402614/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2013,lesleyharris30,6," Not as Fun or Entertaining as the First Grown Ups,
","Grown Ups 2 is an alright movie with basically no storylione,just one joke after another,but a very fun cast that are all clearly close friends.I didn't enjoy this nearly as much as I enjoyed the first Grown Ups,I thought the first one had tons of very funny scenes that turned out really good and that it was very underrated by critics,but there are a lot more misses in this one.My biggest problem was that there was too much childish humor (fart jokes,toilet humor,etc) and that Taylor Lutner was in it too much and Andy Samberg wasn't in it enough,when you get a big and funny star like him in your movie,you don't give him a brief cameo were he dosen't even speak.Still there was a lot of funny scenes,mostly from Adam Sandler,Chris Rock,Kevin James and David Spade,and they should have been in it a lot more instead of having a lot of it focus on their kids.If you enjoyed the first Grown Ups,you will be disappointed,but you will still laugh a lot.",/review/rw3402614/?ref_=tt_urv

14 June 2016,TheLittleSongbird,1," One of Sandler's worst
","The first 'Grown Ups' film was a rather mediocre at best film, gave it a maybe generous 4/10. It had a few decent things, that sadly were outweighed by the many moments that were lazy and unfunny.",/review/rw3402614/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2013,neil-476,6," Not very good, but I quite liked it anyway
","Grown Ups featured Adam Sandler and the usual suspects in a movie which had some amusement value in the context of a loose narrative about bringing together childhood friends for a particular event. Three years later, a sequel features many of the same cast in a plot less series of character threads and vignettes, much of which is childish, crude, slapstick, halfwitted, lazy, and occasionally sentimental.",/review/rw3402614/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2013,andrynas,7," This Just made me smile
","Yeah, I know this movie is stupid, has absolutely no plot, the acting is plain, characters are not well developed, you have all clich√©s you can imagine in movie and etc. But then again I knew what I was going to watch - a silly movie that just makes me smile and this movie did. Cameos where fine and were laughable, jokes were also fine, ( Shaq joke always works), I wish Steve Buscemi had more time on screen though. ",/review/rw3402614/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2013,antmlfc,7," More Grown Up Fun
","I was a big fan of the first outing. I became very reluctant when I heard the sequel had been planned, but I have to say it was absolutely hilarious. It was full of funny moments with the whole cast chipping in. It was really all about the cast not just Adam Sandler. From start to finish funny moment after funny moment with the kids coming into their own especially the baby Chris Rock. This movie is set a few years after the first and all the characters have excuse the pun 'Grown Up'. Some great additions to this cast were Steve Austin and Shaq O' Neill. A really enjoyable movie going experience. I think there will be a fair few that didn't like the movie because it was stupid in parts but guess what people it is a comedy there suppose to be silly and stupid. 7/10",/review/rw3402614/?ref_=tt_urv

18 September 2013,c_armendia,8," Funny Movie, that's all
","I agree with most of the people reviewing this movie. Yes, it doesn't make sense at all and it doesn't follow a plot line. I mean, all of their old high school friends live in the same town and they run to each other every second, as if that happens in real life. Many things doesn't make sense also, but.. the point of the movie was to laugh and I sure did!",/review/rw3402614/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2013,calebcunningham41,3," I was greatly disappointed.
","When I heard that a second Grown Ups movie was coming out I was immediately excited. Being a a huge fan of the first one; my expectations were very high for the second. Obviously too high. This film had basically no point or plot at all. It was incredibly disappointing. I barely laughed at all. All of the jokes and humor was unbelievably crass and perverted. The movie was just plan dirty. The first one had its moments but this one felt like a big ""one of those moments."" The dialog was disappointingly gross in the end. Giving this a 3 out of 10 still seems a little to high and mighty even for this. I wasted my money. Don't waste yours and don't see this lame excuse for a sequel.",/review/rw3402614/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2013,eagle-mountain,," OMG Absolutety Stupid!
","Went to see this and wish I could have worked all day instead!!! This was an absolute waste of time and money. Waste of my money for paying to see this crap and super waste of money spent on making this garbage. It has some funny moments, most of which are shown in the previews, but there is no real flow or storyline. It has some solid actors in it too, which is a shame, because it seems to me that if they cared about their careers at all, they should have been able to read the script and see that it would not work. I assure you, if you are over 12...no, over 7 years old, you will leave disappointed... Please don't waste your money too!!!!!!!!!!!!!",/review/rw3402614/?ref_=tt_urv

2 June 2019,JupiHornet,1," Probably the worst movie I've ever seen
","I'm serious. On an objective level, this might be the worst movie I've ever seen. Literally nothing happens between the beginning and the end. Nothing is lost and nothing is gained. Everything is the same at the end as at the beginning. And for a comedy movie, there's only one funny joke in the entire hour and 40 minute long film. ONE. This is just a really painful movie to watch all around.",/review/rw3402614/?ref_=tt_urv

14 July 2013,wideload33,1," what a waste of time
","I thought the first movie was bad... but this, this is the definition of a horrible movie, terrible acting with a stupid story and awful humor, this crap didn't even make me laugh once. I advise you to not watch this movie ever in your life unless you want to throw away an hour and a half of your life. Adam Sandler just can't make funny movies anymore. Do not watch this waste of time. I remember watching Kevin James on the king of queens and that is a really funny show, I really don't know why he is also constantly in movies that aren't funny. I guess its a way to make a quick buck in the industry, stick to real comedies, like This Is The End. Its a very funny movie :) Don't get me wrong, old adam sandler movies are funny, but he doesn't have the touch anymore.",/review/rw3402614/?ref_=tt_urv

","Seriously what happened? What happened to the Adam Sandler i use to know. Happy Gilmore, billy Madison, Mr deeds.....remember when those were actually and genuinely funny? I think Adam Sandler has really lost his humor now. Honestly this movie has a bunch of 30-40 year old acting like a bunch of children, the humor is just really dry and awful and quite frankly makes the actors look stupid and to top it all off...WHAT A STUPID STORY LINE!!!.

25 January 2016,zjfa146,1," Avoid, avoid, avoid!!
","I don't think many people liked the original Grown Ups but I genuinely thought it was quite funny. We looked forward to watching the follow up but oh my God, how wrong we were! This follow up is truly awful and I barely made it through it without turning it off. The jokes are terrible, like they were written by primary school kids in the school playground. The whole film is so immature its unreal (and that's coming from someone who like The Ringer!). They have lost their way soooooooo badly with this film and I hope to God they never make a 3rd one if it follows in the footsteps of this one! And the worst thing is that they had a reasonable setting after the first film and with some good actors but they just ruined it..",/review/rw3402614/?ref_=tt_urv
