15 January 2018,philfeeley,9," Reviewers miss the point
","This is a great show, illustrating how crime has gone global, just like capitalism. One reviewer didn't like it because some villains were Russian. Did he even watch the show? There are criminals from Israel, India, Pakistan, Mexico and Czech Republic. Just because there are no Americans yet (they may yet show up), doesn't mean it's unfairly portraying Russians as criminals.",/review/rw4140258/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2018,nyutkamarko,10," definite YES
","You've got the right amount of thrill/suspense there, personal drama, characters are also written very well. Really liked the pace of the show, it's not slow at all, it's how it should be! Loved how they portrait the global scale and connections between crime organizations like a whole globalized crime world. And of course an awesome choice of native speaking actors, locations and decorations made this thing believable and alive, wasn't expected to see that level of accuracy in a tv show.
The only weird thing there is the show title. People apparently think that it is connected to McDonald's or burgers, not the best name for criminal show like that I reckon. I hope it'll have good ratings and I'll see the 2 season",/review/rw4140258/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2018,dwmckone5873,9," Great Show! Horrible title!
","I wasn't expecting much from this. I hadn't heard anything about it and really expected it to just be a low-budget stinker. I really like shows and movies about organized crime so I gave it a shot. I was very wrong. First, don't listen to the reviews saying it's too slow. It's not. It has plenty of thrilling moments. The story is very well written and tells a story of organized crime on a GRAND scale, taking you all over the world. The acting is very good and the cinematography is gorgeous! This series is not like a James Bond flick. It actually reminds me more of THE NIGHT MANAGER starring Tom Hiddleston.
I highly recommend!",/review/rw4140258/?ref_=tt_urv

","As the series progresses I think it's getting better and better, it's gripping, high octane, pulse racing viewing. The McMafia name I'm assuming is an attempt to show the globalisation of crime, how something can quickly spread worldwide, crime is unfortunately global these days. I get why the Russians are a little miffed as there is a bit of Russian bashing in it, but in real life there are Russian criminals, as in deed there are British and Israeli (American etc.) James Norton impresses in everything he does, McMafia is another in the list of successes for him. Is this a pre empt for James Bond, time will tell. So the series perhaps starts off a little slow, and is very political heavy in its story telling, but it's intelligent, compulsive, gripping viewing, more please.",/review/rw4140258/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2018,y-61772,10," One of the best shows I've seen
","I decided to watch McMafia one evening thinking that I'm not going to last even 10 min into it. Pretty much was expecting Russian cliches on top of cliches. Was pleasantly surprised that I was wrong. Just after one episode, I was hooked. Let me tell you ... the first season ending that aired yesterday was one of the best endings in a long time ... period. 
This show is for people who have an open mind and wants to feel something new and exciting. This show is focused on eastern Europe and two Russian families in particular. Both hero and a villain great however actor who the plaid villain is just astonishing. Russian cast is genuinely talented. There are similarities between this and Godfather however they are entirely different.
Another thing I really loved about this show is that there is no unnecessary drama or long episodes that make no sense. All eight episodes go by very fast.
One caveat - This show is not for people with a victim mentality.",/review/rw4140258/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2018,captram,10," From the reviews, it is either love it or hate it.
","After watching 7 episodes, I have to say it is very well done. Gets better with every episode, and I noticed a trend with the bad reviewers, which is most only watched the one episode. 
They don't realize most slow shows get better over time...because they build up the climax for the ending. ",/review/rw4140258/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2018,sleemice,6," It's a definite YES for me!!!
","Something different, new and exciting. A modern take on the olden day series about ""mafia"" and I'm loving it. Using modern terminology about companies and finance which are really what makes the world go round definitely. Yes there is violence but the violence is based on the actual story that goes on and theplot is pretty great.",/review/rw4140258/?ref_=tt_urv

","Alex Godman is trying to be an ordinary English banker but his family are Russian and had been in the criminal underworld there till things got too dangerous. They managed to keep a relatively low profile until his uncle tries to kill Vadim Kalyagin; the man responsible for their exile. He fails and soon Vadim has Alex's uncle killed. Alex now wants revenge and sets about using his financial company to help Vadim's rivals; notably Semiyon Kleiman, an Israeli. Inevitably Alex finds himself getting more deeply involved and he and his family are in greater danger than before.",/review/rw4140258/?ref_=tt_urv

2 October 2020,searchanddestroy-1,10," The raise of a Russian godfather
","I was truly amazed by this series, far from the NARCOS like shows or even SOPRANO one, between the most violent, bloodthirsty, hysterical and minimalist oriented mafia genre. I have not seen many series speaking of the Russian mafia, though it doesn't show only the Russian side but also the international connection. Good story telling and acting, pulled by an awesome editing. I really hope that there will be a second season. The final of the first one was heavily influenced by the GODFATHER part 3.",/review/rw4140258/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2021,fraser-simons,8," Smart at showing globalized criminalization
","While the family drama is alright, and gets a bit boring-the thing I most like about this show is the way it shows how each aspect of various crime perpetrated is actually intricately connected at a global level. Money, sex trafficking, murder, whatever it might be. They are not siloed and abstract things that can be ignored. Neither is there a simple solution.",/review/rw4140258/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2019,skepticskeptical,7," Good, not Great
","McMafia is worth watching, despite quite a few flaws. It is not a masterpiece because there are too many hackneyed stereotypes and rehashed plot lines from every movie in existence. Well, that might be a slight exaggeration, but I felt that ideas were pilfered all over the place, beginning with the intro music and film of the cities, which looks and sounds similar to those of House of Cards. Then there are the obvious parallels to the Godfather. The story of corruption is essentially that of Michael Corleone. Is that because these plot lines are always integral to organized crime? Perhaps. Another issue I had was the use of cheap tricks to build suspense--for example, focusing on the mother when the imminent victim would be the fiancé. And some of the subplots just seem gratuitous. (The father sleeping with and impregnating his daughter´s best friend? Really?) Anyway, despite all of these flaws, I obviously liked the series well enough to watch all eight episodes of season 1, and if I am still a member of Prime by the time season 2 exists, I´ll definitely give it a try.",/review/rw4140258/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2018,marcojovanovic,10," Very nice show. Something like breaking bad.
","I like it a lot!
Yes, it is focused on this russian family but, I don't see it as the usual thing against russians in the movies.
The main character is the son of a big russian boss but they live in london and have ordinary life now... He is discovering his dark side during the show and he begins to like the power. Money drugs, power... I really really like it. Hope there will be a season 2.",/review/rw4140258/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2018,robertemerald,8," Great direction for BBC drama!
","If you liked An Honourable Woman or The Night Manager then this is the show to watch next. Nothing flimsy about this, like a James Bond movie made human. It's about an honest but proud banker that secretly gets in bed with some very serious clients in order to save his fund, on the dubious advice of a fast-living uncle. It portrays a world of serious corporate and political transactions which hides what is basically your usual mob-types. I took two points off for the title. For several weeks I honestly thought something called McMafia must be a documentary, and thus ignored it as I was more interested in David Attenborough. ",/review/rw4140258/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2018,paul2001sw-1,6," Not as interesting as it should be
","Every country has its share of gangsters, sadly, but in Russia there's a criminal elite that first robbed the old Soviet state, and is now tightly emeshed with the new one. This should make for an interesting drama; but unfortunately, 'McMafia' isn't quite it. Firstly, its a tale of international drug smuggling, in glamorous locations, but there's not much detail in its portrait of Russian politics, which I might have found more interesting. Secondly, the idea of the quiet respectable gangster, who loves his beautiful family, and has others do his dirty work for him, is all very well, but when every character fits the same archetype it makes for a flat story Thirdly, the hero - a suppodesly clean banker who is drawn into the dark web of his criminal family - is unconvincing - we need to believe in his purity before he goes over to the dark side. Overall, this didn't come to life for me - a shame given the potential of the scenario.",/review/rw4140258/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2018,collinsenosh,8," Money! Where Black meets White!
","It's technical, feels real, after all it's based on journalistic non-fiction by Misha Glenny!
 The world is changing fast and so is crime!
 Alex Godman stands out, coz he is too good to be mixed with criminals, and turns out he is too good in the hands of one as well.
 Yet all this world -wide syndicate is portrayed using a few well developed characters, Godman's secretary for example a deviation from all carricatures.
 Simultaneous subplots to keep one hooked, but above all the plot makes a lot of sense, the biggest pitfall with intrigues otherwise.",/review/rw4140258/?ref_=tt_urv

1 February 2018,TheDonaldofDoom,," It's like McDonald's
","Ugh. What a disappointing show. There's no point investing into a big budget, complex story and a genuinely interesting idea if the characters are boring as hell. They are literally cardboard cutouts that I do not care about whatsoever, and that's not helped by the flat acting. The only thing James Norton seems to be able to do is flash that annoying smile. Point is, if I don't care about the characters, why should I care about the plot? ",/review/rw4140258/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2018,normanemailer,2," Don't try to follow the plots
","James Norton has been talked up as the next 007. I don't know who's done the 'talking up' but, for me, he's wooden with a slight speaking lisp. No way will he play Bond.
Other lead actors are efficient but not always convincing. But it's the improbable, and uneasy, storylines that are most annoying. Of course, drama must be too much like 'real' life or it would be dull and dreary most of the time. This series seems to have taken Glenny's book and adapted it to attract viewers by making oligarchs seem more violent than they probably are. Buying up expensive properties in London and doing tax avoidance deals isn't on par with murder.
There'll probably be a second series but I won't watch it.",/review/rw4140258/?ref_=tt_urv
