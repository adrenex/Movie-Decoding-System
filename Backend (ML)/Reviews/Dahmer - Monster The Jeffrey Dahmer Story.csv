21 September 2022,miss_toucan,8," Evan Peters is brilliant!

21 September 2022,Erik_Surewaard,9," It is like Mindhunter - you will learn how someone became a serial killer
","When I clicked to watch the ""Dahmer""-release on Netflix, I thought it would be the so-many'th documentary on him. But what a surprise it was to see that it is actually a mini-series of the crimes that Dahmer committed. And what a mini-series it is!",/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Tough to watch
","Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is a series created by Ryan Murphy (American Crime Story, American Horror Story, 9-1-1, Hollywood, Pose, Feud, etc.). Everything Murphy touches is pretty much successful and this is no different. Everyone knows this story by now...he's one of the most notorious serial killers in the history of the United States. He would lure young men to his apartment and not only kill them but eat them. This is a story that's been told many times but this show takes the unique perspective of largely telling the story from the victims point of view. Evan Peters is absolutely brilliant as Jeffrey Dahmer. He's so good that he should be talked about for an Emmy nomination next year. This series is worth watching for Peters performance alone. This is very dark, disturbing story and Ryan Murphy does a great job telling it.",/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2022,IonicBreezeMachine,10," Compelling and repellant in equal measure, Dahmer is the most definitive look at not just the titular killer, but the origins and fallout of his heinous actions.
","Starting in July 25, 1991, notorious serial murderer Jeffrey Dahmer (Evan Peters) is arrested when Dahmer's potential victim Tracy Edwards (Shaun J. Brown) miraculously escapes and brings the police back to his apartment. Dahmer is arrested after uncovering the various horrors and mementos from Dahmer's murders, we soon go back through Dahmer's past to see what lead him to this point before eventually shifting focus to the stories of the victims, the fallout felt by the community and victims' families, as well as the bureaucratic and law enforcement failures that allowed Dahmer to continue indulging his twisted appetites.",/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2022,saimariejohnson,10," Where's Evan's Award for Best Performance of the Year?
","There are no doubts that Evan Peters has killed this role by delivering one of the most engrossing performances of his career, and that's saying something considering the aptitude of his many esteemed performances to date. Dahmer's entire childhood outfitted for audiences to get a further in depth understanding of his delving into degeneracy and the reasons behind his atrocious actions. The fault of a system that didn't care about helping those who showed signs of psychosis and allowed a young man to fall through the cracks along with a corrupt and negligent police department that chose to turn blind eyes and deaf ears due to the nature of homosexuality and people of color being Dahmer's main victims because of obvious systemic racism...all of it set to Evan's performance was outstanding. I can only hope people learn from the many lessons this horrible tragedy, but the engrossing way that Mr. Peter's acted in this very challenging role is an absolute stunner.",/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Evan Peters is terrific here!
","I want to star off by saying Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer story (what a ridiculous title) is a very tough watch. I grew up about 30min from Milwaukee and even though I was a little kid when he was arrested I still remember this story being a huge, especially around here. How he was able to get away with what he did for as long as he did is very troubling. The police dropped the ball time and time again and lots of innocent lives were lost because of it. Evan Peters deserves every bit of recognition he's getting from this series, he was brilliant. The rest of the cast is good too but it's Peters who makes this show what it is.",/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2022,ha77y73ad97,8," This had me on the edge of my seat the whole time in a bad way!
","The way that this was handled was prefect, there was no glorification of the violence that some series allow. This was a story driven decent into his life where no one can feel sorry for him. We see all moments from his younger ages to his worthy death in prison which is only the second murder we actually see play out on screen.",/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2022,ups-36964,8," Probably the most realistic portrayal of a serial killer i've ever seen
","Evan Peters has seriously outdone his job here. His acting was top notch and his portrayal of dahmer, from his clothing to expressions, everything was perfect, perfect everything, down to the last minute details. And apart from him, the performances of the other cast members (His father, his mother, grandma, Glenda cleveland and the victims) were excellent too.",/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2022,hoernkeem,9," Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story (2022, Netflix) Surprisingly layered portrayal of not only Dahmer, but the race relations that allowed him to flourish
",Ryan Murphy has been quite prolific creating high profile shows starting with 'Glee' and moving to 'American Horror Story' to 'American Crime Story' and now with 'Dahmer' he starts an anthology series on Netflix under the 'Monster' title. There are supposed to be at least two more series/seasons following the extreme success of 'Dahmer' although the subjects of subsequent seasons have yet to be revealed. The show stars Evan Peters as well known serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer as well as Richard Jenkins as his dad and Molly Ringwald as his stepmother. The series contains ten episodes that all were released at the same time which is the Netflix standard in September of 2022.,/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2022,adrian_rawling,9," A dark, taut and compelling docudrama.
","For those interested in the psychology of a serial killer, there is no more fascinating character study than Jeffrey Dahmer. He was a psychiatric enigma and a profoundly sick individual. A chronic alcoholic from a very young age. A sexual deviant with all manner of unusual fetishes. A necrophiliac. A cannibal.",/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2022,Her-Excellency,6," A sad account, in every sense of the word, particularly however, with the liberties it takes.
","While Evan Peters certainly deserves accolades for his particularly engrossing and gripping personification of the monster that was Dahmer, the series - the first half of which was excellent - leaves much to be desired.",/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2022,DesertBeagler,," Factual inaccuracies and artificial racism
",The excellence of this mini-series is eroded by important factual inaccuracies and the producer's agenda-driven desire to race bait.,/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2022,man_with_a_van,7," Solid but weak last episodes
",This is a solid true crime show with brilliant acting. Especially Evan Peters does an awesome job. It's exciting to see the horrible story of JD staged so carefully. Would have been an 8 but the last two episodes focus too much on JDs neighbour Glenda Cleveland. She surely suffered a lot when JDs crimes were discovered but 15 people had been killed whose friends and families certainly suffered a lot more. I think those people deserve more attention than a lady that indeed did a good job but was not involved in the matter so much. That's why the last episodes are a little bit slow moving. All in all worth a watch.,/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,Draysan-Jennings,7," Disturbing but good
",This is definitely the best portrayal of Jeffery Dahmer I've seen. Evan Peter's was great in this. Eat your heart out Jeremey Renner. No pun intended. It's about time someone made a mini-series about Dahmer's life. Mostly because this psychopaths story is way too intricate to squeeze into a two hour film. The 2002 Jeremy Renner film was terrible and the 2017 film My Friend Dahmer didn't do the story much justice. This show gets into much more detail. I had no idea his mother was on tons of psychological medication while she was pregnant. Or that she was a suicidal UFO nut. I never knew he spent time in Germany as a US Army combat medic. A lot of the events that took place were news to me. I'm glad I decided to check this show out. It's definitely worth a watch. 8 stars.,/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,ThereelscoopwithKK,8," Well Made but Terribly Difficult to Watch
","This is one of the most difficult reviews I've written. To start off I'd have to give credit where it is due. It was a very well produced series with excellent performances, but at the same time I was conflicted watching it. Even before they exposed the sick people who became fans of him in the later episodes I wondered why I was watching this to begin. There's something wrong with giving all of this fame and glory to this evil lunatic. Unlike many others I've read in the reviews I didn't feel sympathy for him for one second. There are many individuals in this world with sick fantasies and poor upbringings who don't go on to do what he did.",/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2022,john-allen76-1,10," Genius portrayal of a monster who you actually feel sorry for at times
",Absolutely incredible performance and whilst it's frightening what Dahmer did it's evident that his parents completely messed him up and created the monster themselves.,/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2022,dsself45,8," Disturbing
","Evans Peter does a masterful job of portraying Jeffrey Dahmer. I was in my 20's when this story broke. Obviously, it did make national news, but not like it would today with the internet & social media. After watching this series, I still cannot believe this actually happened, but know it did. My heart breaks all over again for these families. I saw in some reviews that people took exception to the light being shown on the police force at that time. But, I think it was needed & deserved. I totally respect the police & I am extremely appreciative of the difficult job they do. However, there are bad apples...and it is no secret that there are underserved communities. Jeffrey Dahmer could & should have been stopped sooner. I read that some of the families feel victimized all over again. While I feel I can somewhat understand that feeling, I'm hoping something can be learned from this so this never happens again. Probably wishful thinking on my part though.",/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,nigepitz,6," Fell off a woke cliff
","Dahmer's story has been told many times simply because we are horrified and fascinated by what he did in equal measure. His story is also part of the great debate about nature vs nurture and what has to happen to someone to turn them into a monster. This series started off so well as we delved into this very issue. The first 6 or 7 episodes were compelling but then something happened, as though the director suddenly chickened out. Later victims and Dahmer's experiments with injecting his victims in the brain to create a zombie he could control, were completely ignored. A relationship with one of his victims was invented and an occupant of his apartment block was invented. Then suddenly and for no apparent reason, the whole story stopped being about a serial killer and became all about civil rights with it being suggested that Dahmer's motivation was racist. Dahmer was many things but he was an equal opportunities killer. He chose victims because he found them beautiful and the colour of that person was not his concern. I don't understand why the series suddenly went down this cul-de-sac. Yes, he could have been caught earlier if the police had done their job but that is a different story about institutional racism in the USA and nothing to do with Dahmer, his actions or motivation.",/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2022,ajikude,10," Excellent and close to real documentary
",Really well made. Great actinu. Much better than the other Netflix tv series. I saw the documentary a few times and read alot about the case. Probably one of the best docu drama ever. The tv series follows events very closely and in detail. He had a sickness and he was insane but somehow the court felt he was not insane.,/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2022,panagiotis1993,8," Truly Disturbing: Inside The Mind of a Monster
","My review has no spoilers, I will just let you know how I feel about this show. This show is a special one, there is so much attention to detail! I've seen all the movies that have been released about Jeffrey Dahmer but none was as good, as accurate and as passionate as this show. Peters was absolutely convincing as Jeffrey Dahmer, giving some extraordinary performances. What you will see in the show is not a 100% accurate but most things are actually based on the real events, which makes the show much more intense, brutal, tragic and dramatic, sometimes you will get a horror vibe. This show is not for everyone, only adults who can stomach this kind of theme should watch it!",/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2022,kamalmanvi,9," Evan Peters absolutely nailed the Jeff Dahmer character!
",Evan Peters is terrific in the role of Jeff Dahmer. Even the voice and the tone and the accent is matched. I really enjoyed this show a lot. Richard Jenkins also did a really great job at playing Dahmer's father. I'm really impressed. Also the background music is very good. I this show is popular and also getting a lot of negative criticism because of the glorification of a serial killer. But I think the writers of this show hadn't this intention in their mind. This show is successfully able to tell the real story of not just about the serial killer but also the social system that leads to his venture keeps going on. Really good show. Everyone should watch this show at least one time!,/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2022,fffflora,4," Inaccuracies everywhere
","The first several episodes were pretty good. The last few after his capture felt very rushed and biased with Jeffrey not depicted accurately at all. It was like they got tired and dropped the ball. Watch all the interviews of Dahmer on YouTube and you'll see how they depicted him in prison in the series is nothing like how he really was then. They kept trying to portray him as evil and sleazy even though he was not and was repentant (he was found not to be a psychopath when tested, and even his doctors were genuinely sad to hear of his passing). As a psychology student, Dahmer has always fascinated me for the uniqueness of his psychology and how he wasn't truly evil like other serial killers, just incredibly sick.",/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,AdrienneGrayceMusic,1," Not another one
","Oh boy. How many shows and movies, documentaries, etc are they going to make of this guy? The only difference between this and the others is that this series included false things and propganda in it with the sole purpose of putting false narratives out there.",/review/rw8723730/?ref_=tt_urv
