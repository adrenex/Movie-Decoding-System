28 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,10," One of my favorite shows of all-time!
","The best way to describe Banshee is that it is just a flat out awesome show and a must watch! It's become one of my favorite shows of all-time. Everything about this show is excellent, the acting, writing, directing, production, cinematography, etc are all as good as it gets. I can not overstate just how good this show really is. It's one of the rare shows where every season is just as good as the others. It's about a recently paroled thief as he witnesses and then takes over the identity of a Sheriff in Banshee, Pa. Named Lucas Hood, and where his former girlfriend and partner now lives under a fake identity herself and has started a family. It follows Lucas as he tries to reunite with his girlfriend, keep his secret identity as the Sheriff and do that job well and also resume his life as a thief. He does all that will hunted by gangsters he betrayed before he went to prison and their mob boss (who also happens to be his old partner/girlfriends father). As I have already said, this has become one of my favorite shows ever and will probably be one of yours to!",/review/rw5141602/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2014,gogoschka-1,8," My favorite guilty pleasure
",Every once in a while a show comes along that catches you completely off guard; you only want to check out the pilot because you've read a comment or two on IMDb comparing it to some other show you kinda like â€“ and BOOM: you're blown away. That's what happened to me with 'Banshee'.,/review/rw5141602/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2020,Supermanfan-13,10," Underrated!
","Banshee is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best shows ever created! I really can't say enough about this amazing show that hasn't already been said. I know people say this about a ton of different shows but Banshee really is one of the most underrated shows ever! I absolutely LOVE this show so if you haven't seen it yet do yourself a favor and go watch it, and if you've already seen it go watch it again!",/review/rw5141602/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,petrow-31308,8," A hidden gem
","Banshee is an unapologetic, action-packed show with Game of Thrones-level nudity and violence, and is definitely not for the faint-hearted. Sexual abuse, domestic- and prison- violence, organized crime and brutal executions - Banshee does not shy away when it comes exploring the dark excesses of human behaviour.",/review/rw5141602/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2022,info-80807,8," 'Skinamax' indeed!

","What a great show to watch
Has it all
Job was a great character and scene stealer",/review/rw5141602/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2014,A_Different_Drummer,10," well this is embarrassing
","I am watching the series in sequence, just started the second season, and I have been reviewing individual episodes in the IMDb because frankly they are some of the most amazing episodes I have ever seen in mainstream TV.",/review/rw5141602/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2022,thetypingavocado,10," such an addicting show!
","Banshee was such an addicting ride, from start to finish. Of course, the main highlight was the CRAZY BRUTAL ACTION, which was SO WELL DONE. Really made you feel the damage. But man, there are also great performances and great characters in here. Antony Starr's ""Lucas Hood"" was the most notable one, but everyone else here acted their hearts out. And really, these characters feel extremely human, which I love.",/review/rw5141602/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2019,ninja-turtle,10," Almost everthing you've read or heard is true
","The story is unbelievable. The action, fights (some of the best choreographed fights ever in any medium), sex, language are all WAY over the top, sometimes to the point of ridiculousness. But that is what set this show apart from anything else on television and what makes it so worth watching. Is it for everyone? Probably not. But the characters...the good ones and the bad ones (and most of the main ones are a little of both) are all outstanding as are the actors that portray them. I watched Banshee from the first airing and it instantly became one of my favorite shows ever and at the end of each episode I couldn't wait for the next. If you are a fan of 80's & 90's action movies then this is a show you need to watch.",/review/rw5141602/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2020,Chi-Town-2,10," Worth the commitment. Wow.
","Masterpiece of a series.
It's important to get thru the first 4 episodes. Those didn't grab me, initially. (I appreciated them later on 2nd and 3rd viewings).",/review/rw5141602/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2022,jit-23697,10," Love love love it
","This drama would not have made it A******* if Anthony Starr and hoon lee had not been in it, they are fantastic actors loved the character of JOB he's so funny and very very intelligent and thats one of the reasons i kept watching it, the rest of the crew did a brilliant job too. I watched 3 seasons in 3 days because I loved it so much. Normally some dramas take me forever to watch because I get bored in between but this one has a kick to it and I cannot wait for the next episode it's a bit of everything for everyone. Oh well here goes season 4.",/review/rw5141602/?ref_=tt_urv

26 July 2018,skip-98756,10," An Absolutely Outstanding Tv Series!!!
","I must have seen banshee at least 4 times by now and after rewatching the pilot,i couldnt help but be drawn into watching the whole series to the end, and OMG ! what an ending! closure on all levels for all characters..Immensely satisfying !! As many have stated,the lead actor anthony has an extraordinary presense and the ability to emote and get that emotion across the screen,often without even using words,but thru body language and facial expression..pretty special..The main protagonist is Kai proctor and much of what i said about anthony applies to the incredible actor who plays Kai..from the moment he 1st appears, there is an air of mystery, power, presensce and menace exuded from his character that you just know is going to be unleashed and make for an explosive dynamic between him and Hood. ALL, and i mean ALL the characters in this show are very complex, layered and Ultra convincing in their roles..I can honestly say i love every one of them, they are that good and there is Not a bad actor in the entire cast..they all are quite incredible ...Burton is a Terminator like assassin that seems unstoppable and unbeatable ,no matter who he goes up against, he is utterly fearless, once the glasses come off this guy becomes a serious badass..the over the top fight scenes are one of the great things that u can look forward to in literally every episode, and not just one but multiple fights!, and not just the men but women as well,often wiping the floor with men..This show doesnt just have a lead badass but his protagonists are as well and the girls..insane! What i also like in this show is the multiple storylines all happenning at same time, each one more wild than the other..As far as all time best Badguy in the shown i gotta give it to Kai,then burton,then Huge indian with the voice like James earl jones!, then Nolah the indian baddass chick who went up against Burton, what a fight! then the military colonel, then rabbit..needless to say i love this show..its ultra violent so be prepared, but its also one hell of a thrilling ride from start to finish, and that finale is 10 stars, one could not ask for a more fulfilling finish..",/review/rw5141602/?ref_=tt_urv

19 August 2019,kosmasp,9," Who shot the sheriff?
","My summary line is meant as small ""stab""/joke, but not a question that will keep you up at night. We have a stranger coming to town, looking for something and someone. Sometimes finding what you are looking for is not enough though. Especially when it is not enough. Now that may sound cryptic - because it is. There are the things that are right there in front of you and then there are the things behind the mask/curtain.",/review/rw5141602/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2015,Meatball_McGee,10," The best action show no one is watching
","Banshee has recently started its third season, yet if you search for online reviews of the show from the major entertainment sites, you'll find almost none. Which is a crying shame, because for any one who loves good action shows, Banshee is a must watch. There's a reason, despite being on a premium channel not many people watch, that Banshee has lasted this long. And that reason is sheer awesome badassery. ",/review/rw5141602/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2021,searchanddestroy-1,8," Inspired by a grade B western, or a TV series
","I recently watched a grade B western from the fifties, starring Jim Davis: BADGE OF MARSHALL BRENNAN, speaking of the same topic, a man on the run picking up the badge of a dead man, a marshall, before arriving in town and then ""assuming"" the task of the marshall. Or the first episode of the 1990's series DEAD MAN'S GUN, again telling the same topic. And I am sure there was many other films or series - anthology episodes - also with this scheme. Back to this show, I found it amazing, supported by an awesome directing and acting too. One of the best action series of all times for me.",/review/rw5141602/?ref_=tt_urv
