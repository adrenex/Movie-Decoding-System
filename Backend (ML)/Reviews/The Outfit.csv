3 May 2022,kosmasp,9," Fitting plan
","Suspend your disbelief - it is possible to do so. Especially because the actors and the setting is so well chosen, that you will just fit right into it. No pun intended - and even though there are certain things that seem quite coincidental and based on luck rather on skill or whatever else you would want to call it, the movie and the characters in it, really draw you in - I guess that could also be considered a pun.",/review/rw8066404/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2022,imseeg,7," Impressive character play, that starts out unassuming, but slowly descends into a story of mischief and pure evil.
",Starts out slow and unassuming. Nothing much happens at first. Is this another boring movie? No way.,/review/rw8066404/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2022,Draysan-Jennings,7," Great movie
",The Outfit proves that you don't need a bunch of over paid actors and a huge budget to make a great film. A good script and solid acting works just as well. 7 stars.,/review/rw8066404/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2022,ferguson-6,7," a cutter, not a tailor
","Greetings again from the darkness. Graham Moore won an Oscar for his screenplay on Alan Turing's life in THE IMITATION GAME (2014). Now he has directed his first feature film, one he co-wrote with Johnathan McClain. The final product is a bit unusual in that it takes place almost entirely in one spot ... a tailor's shop ... and features only a handful of characters. It's a film that would transition easily to the stage for live performances.",/review/rw8066404/?ref_=tt_urv

20 March 2022,parksiet,8," What a surprise this was!
","You don't see many movies like this in theatres these days! And this is exactly why I loved it, it's the kind of film that I really miss seeing a lot of; they type that typically gets dumped on streaming these days. It's an old-fashioned crime thriller that takes place in one location and is a dialogue driven story... and believe it or not it's not part of a franchise! It's a very well done film and is certainly going to be one of the most underrated films of 2022. If you're reading this, don't sleep on it, go see it right away! I didn't even watch a trailer for it, I went in pretty much blind, and absolutely loved it! I ate it right up; it was a huge, pleasant surprise! It's a perfect classic day-in-the-life of a mobster tale!",/review/rw8066404/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2022,gcsman,8," Mark Rylance is, as always, quietly brilliant
","This 'little' film very much has the feeling of a stage play. There is really only one set (the tailor Leonard's shop) in which everything happens. To go along with that, it has an almost claustrophobic atmosphere as the different Chicago gangster characters come and go, threaten Leonard and his receptionist Mable (nicely done by Zoey Deutch), argue, leave again. Leonard basically has to outwit them at every twist and turn (and there are lots of twists and turns), and that is about it for the plot. Add to that the fact that no one is entirely who they seem and we get a fascinating hour and a half of intense 'locked room' drama.",/review/rw8066404/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2022,TxMike,," He's not a tailor, he's a cutter.
","Set in 1956 Chicago, the central character is a Bespoke suit maker played expertly by Mark Rylance. As he has established his business, central to that are the crime ring members who use his services and also his business as a drop off point for some mysterious packages. Presumably some packages of cash, to be picked up by the boss' men.",/review/rw8066404/?ref_=tt_urv

The back room of the shop has a drop box used by the Boyle mob to collect money and pass along messages. The La Fontaines are a rival gang.

15 April 2022,Muhammad_Rafeeq,9," AMERICAN (A+ Movie) My Ratings 9/10
","This was a great ""throwback"" movie using plot devices , and filming aspects of an older generation of movies and it was beautiful. The intrigue mounts throughout the movie building to the surprise climax. I was engaged throughout the entire movie and thoroughly enjoyed it. Every character was well played though I must admit that the ""cutter"" was my favorite. There is no nudity, very little real violence and none of it is graphic, and by modern movie standards almost no swearing.",/review/rw8066404/?ref_=tt_urv

23 May 2022,jtindahouse,8," Made with a lot of class
","As I was watching 'The Outfit' I felt sure that I was going to go to the IMDd trivia section after the film and find out it was based on a play. It all happens in one location, contains a very manageable budget and has exquisite dialogue. And it's a rare play that I'd actually want to see, because this film was damn good.",/review/rw8066404/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2022,oscaralbert,10," This film is similar to and as good as the original version of . . .
",". . . SLEUTH. Watching THE OUTFIT will help the cutting fraternity to bounce back from the overrated PHANTOM THREAD, as it shows why the typical Saville Row tailor shop is frequented by THE KRAYS and THE GODFATHER's, at least the first one. THE OUTFIT is not the sort of ludicrous eye candy represented by the KING'S MAN series. The only reference to a historical person is Al Capone, and how can you set a mob movie in Chicago without mentioning Big Al? Thankfully, the Alcatraz tax cheat is long gone by 1956, when this story takes place. This flick is perfectly paced, cast and plotted--all the twists are in the right places, and few viewers will foresee them all. THE OUTFIT is 2022's PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN.",/review/rw8066404/?ref_=tt_urv

4 April 2022,statuskuo,6," The Cutter Is In
","I am a massive fan of single location movies. ""Identity"" or ""Death And The Maiden"" come to mind. The conceit typically makes the moviemakers get really clever with the use of space. But if you've seen enough movies about mild manner characters with simmering dark pasts, you'll see a lot of this coming from a mile out. Which will leave you wondering ""why was the movie even made?""",/review/rw8066404/?ref_=tt_urv

20 March 2022,bostonct,9," Great change of pace with a lot of unpredictability and quick thinking
","In our current world of CGI, over-the-top not believable action and shallow performances, this is a very entertaining cerebral movie. Lot of surprises you never saw coming. Mark Ryland is just so much fun to watch with his you-never-know-how-or-what-he's-going-to-say deliveries.

31 March 2022,Mrbigham13,9," Exceptional!
","This is one of the best damn movies I've seen in a while. Expertly crafted, very well acted, with phenomenal writing. I can't praise this movie enough, it's no Godfather but for 2022 it's the best movie in years. The tenseness alone you could cut with a knife. It's almost as heavy as No Country for Old Men, and that's high praise. An excellent period piece with all the makings of a classic. Rylance and company sell this tale with ease from one line to the next. Keeps you guessing all the way through just as any good tale should. It's a damn near perfect film. Only left me wanting more. Please make an effort to see it!",/review/rw8066404/?ref_=tt_urv
