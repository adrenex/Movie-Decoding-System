30 December 2011,chris-chasely,10," Powerful movie
","This movie is an amazing movie, depicting intense varied emotions. It encapsulates liberation and freedom along with spirituality which is so much the essence of humanity. I found the sex to be so much a natural part, yet which is so often regarded as 'unnatural'to show in our society. The movie really teaches one to get in touch with his own spirituality instead of the dogma we have created for ourselves. A really powerful and enchanting movie, added by the superb acting by Shari Solanis - an actor with unparell emotional appeal. All in all, a must watch movie with kudos to the director and producer and the rest of the cast as well. Definitely 10 points - more if possible.",/review/rw8762323/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2019,politfilm,10," A sexually repressed society will resort to violence
","At the very beginning we are welcomed with Wilhelm Reich's quote: ""A sexually repressed society will resort to violence"". He is an international trader - a speculator who grew up in a typical American family devoted to power and success. She is an illegal immigrant from Nicaragua, and works as a volunteer in a free clinic. When they meet it's a collision of worlds (quite literally) with plenty of sex and conversations about politics, philosophy, and other worldly pleasures. This movie very effectively raises its voice against the culture in which violence is considered to be top-notch entertainment, while sex is taboo and shame.",/review/rw8762323/?ref_=tt_urv

6 September 2015,kosmasp,5," Explicit
","Explicit images (read nudity), but also penetration have made their way into mainstream movies (no pun intended). And while the term mainstream might feel like a stretch given to a low budget movie, this is not a single case of this thing happening. Low budget movies (or even higher budget movies like Nymphomaniac) do not hold back anymore. Caligula did that many decades ago, but back then it was more like a single case scenario (if you don't count some ""horror"" movies who had some explicit intercourse in them as well).",/review/rw8762323/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2012,wc1996-428-366101,1," Size does matter
","The male lead in this film is a doctor in real life and apparently quite accomplished in a number of fields. What he is doing in this miserable piece of tripe is beyond me. This guy must really want to be an actor which would be great if he could only act which he cannot. He's tall, dark and handsome and sports quite a package which is shown in all its glory, yet you never really believe this guy because he cannot stop being a doctor. There's even a scene where he's in bed with another man as well as a woman and even then it's almost as though he's in an examining room. When he takes hold of the other fellow's appendage I fully expected him to pull out some medical instrument to deal with the matter, but he does not. Yet one has the distinct feeling that the slab of beef in his hand is simply there for examination and nothing else. The female lead in this film is almost beside the point, playing second fiddle to the doctor's package which gets most of the attention in the film.",/review/rw8762323/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2020,jromanbaker,10," Sex is something dark and hidden away
","I have seen this excellent film and wonder why it is hidden away like a monster in a cupboard. It deals partly with an explicit sexual relationship, and yes the lead actor shows his erect penis and the sex real. Both lead actors are not afraid of showing sexual excitement, and James Wortham who is almost dismissed by other reviewers for praise gives a performance that is very fine indeed, and it is ( I hazard a guess ) male reviewers who in the main would rather not see him in this excited state. If he was about to kill someone with an axe or a brutal instrument it would be alright, but no he is just unashamedly and often with great tenderness giving pleasure to another person. That audiences have been stunned by this is beyond my comprehension. Is his penis so shameful that it should be hidden away ? The female genitalia has often been seen on film, and I am thinking especially of the films of Walerian Borowcyck who was praised for such films as ' La Bete ' and considerred by some to be a great director. To make myself clear a woman can simulate sex but a man cannot. This is where the hypocrisy is focussed due to bad sex education and centuries of shame. Above all this film is well made, and the true revelation for me is how much parts of Los Angeles looks like a city from hell with its poor and underprivileged. Now that is something really be shocked about but instead it is the astonished look at the beauty of the sexual act, and especially that part of the male that is usually kept tightly locked up in the attic of our dirty minds.",/review/rw8762323/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2013,rodnywww,10," Good film
",This is a very good film. I totally liked it. The plot is different; but one of the best I have every found.I specially liked the leading actress; not just because she is good looking; but because she is a talented actress. She does a great job to attract viewers to the film. The leading actor is also a talented person. He is totally justifying his character. This story is actually making us to think twice about our fast faced life. It influence us to explore the true meaning of life and living. Aren't we all chasing after a dream? Which sometimes making us nothing but zombies who don't have hearts. This film is one of the best I have ever watched. I recommend for anybody who has time to watch a film with patient.,/review/rw8762323/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2021,daliou,8," Deserves watching and reflection
","Comparing the movie to the critic reviews is like talking about another film: this very true and provocative cinematique angle is nearly a threat to todays society, just because it is honest enough. Unlike what is written in the other user reviews, I think that the explicit sex scenes are NOT the main reason why this film has been chopped up by the critics, but they eventuallly add up to all its superficially called ""negative points"".

5 September 2017,jayalahindonesia,9," I like this movie
","I think this is best movie I've ever watched from US NR categories. What makes me displease from this movie is that the actors are not played in other (great) movies especially the leading female actor. I've checked out her profile and see that she played only in 2 movies. What a sad career for a good talent. In Now & Later she played all dialogues and acts superbly, makes me real diving into the story and putting aside frontal nudity scenes. Like Avanti!, I put this movie in my special folder in my external HD drive where anybody won't fine Shakespeare in Love in it. Absolutely great!",/review/rw8762323/?ref_=tt_urv

","Angela (Shari Solanis) embodies the qualities of a woman set free. She is self-sufficient intellectually, emotionally, sexually and financially. She picks the men she would like to have, in her life and otherwise, like the books she keeps on her shelf: Reich on psychology, a treatise on Chi power. A lover from Nicaragua who roams the world as a journalist. A wanted trader, seemingly the main protagonist (James Keller Northam's Bill) who decides to flee to Nicaragua, the country the violence of which she left for a better life as an illegal immigrant in LA where she works as a nurse.",/review/rw8762323/?ref_=tt_urv
