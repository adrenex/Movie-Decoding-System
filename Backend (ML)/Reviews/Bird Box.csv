7 September 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," Awesome original Aussie zombie flick!
",This is not your run of the mill typical zombie flick. It's much more than that.,/review/rw4193143/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2019,Sleepin_Dragon,6," It's decent, if unremarkable.
","I am a little surprised by all the accolades, and the excellent reviews this film received, it isn't bad, it's just slow, and it pains me to say it, but just another zombie story, albeit one that is incredibly well made, and superbly acted.",/review/rw4193143/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2018,DdyBd_90,8," These reviews are from movie snobs!
","Some of the reviews here are extremely harsh on this movie. This movie is an adaptation of a 7 minute short film, was produced by netflix, didn't have a huge budget, and they still managed to create a fansastic film with incredible acting and a heartwarming, if tragic, storyline. This is not an oscar worthy film and wasnt created under the same standers as some of these comments seem to believe, but it was definitely worth the watch. If you want an exciting, emotional story about a parent's devotion to his child amidst the end of the world, give this movie a shot!",/review/rw4193143/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2018,amber-540-735709,7," First Zombie film that's moved me to tears
","I'm not normally a fan of zombies - they're just too zombie like for my liking. So I tend to avoid zombie movies. But this film flipped my perception of them by telling the story of the gradual deterioration of a decent family man struggling to protect his family, into a murderous flesh eating single dad. Despite this ridiculous concept, it was done very convincingly, Martin Freeman giving a moving and realistic performance helped enormously by his obvious connection with the babies playing his daughter. The setting was stunning and the social relevance of the relationships between whites and indigenous folk was thought provoking and uplifting. 
I jolly well enjoyed this film!",/review/rw4193143/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2018,rafvanhaver,10," Not a horror movie. But an amazing movie
",I love zombie movies. I've seen 'em all.,/review/rw4193143/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2018,Councillor3004,," A surprisingly powerful genre film.
","As much as I usually enjoy horror movies, the zombie sub-genre has never been one I'm particularly fond of. Except for classic films such as ""Night of the Living Dead"" and Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" movies, or modern entries into the genre such as ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""Train to Busan"", I have never seen any outstanding zombie films which stood out from the crowd. However, this year's ""Cargo"", an Australian indie based on a 2013 short film and starring Martin Freeman, succeeded in its attempt to do just that: stand out from the crowd.",/review/rw4193143/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2018,brisvegan1971,8," A zombie film with heart
","I read some of the negative reviews of this film before watching it. I almost avoided it for that reason but I'm so glad I didn't. It's a great film, well written and acted, perfectly staged in various locations of the Australian outback to complement the characters and situations they find themselves in. I felt it conveyed realistic human dilemmas and heart, and brought something new to the genre. Forget the naysayers, do yourself a favour and experience this film.",/review/rw4193143/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2018,stacey-grainger1,9," 28 days since I was this impressed
","I'm no movie critic, but this movie had everything I wanted and more. Clever, genuinely believable and a stunning performance from Martin Freeman. If you want an intelligent movie about what might happen if the world had a pandemic without lots of unnecessary bloody gore, this is right up there.",/review/rw4193143/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2021,kevin_robbins,9," This is a remarkable movie to catch, especially if you're looking for unique and different zombie picture
","Cargo (2017) is an outstanding and unique Australian horror movie available on Netflix. The storyline involves a family living on a barge on the water during a post zombi apocalypse. As they scavenge for food the mother injures herself causing the family to try and rush her to shore and eventually to the hospital. As she becomes sicker the dad and their new born daughter do their best to support her and avoid other survivors and zombies. This movie is directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke, who also collaborated on The Haunting - Bly Manner. The cast includes Martin Freeman (The Hobbit), Simone Landers (Grace Beside Me), Susie Porter (Better than Sex) and Bruce Carter (Picnic at Hanging Rock). The storyline for this picture is outstanding and very well paced, depicted and creative. I loved the intermingled culture and characters throughout. The action scenes are very well done and the ending is magnificent. This is a remarkable movie to catch, especially if you're looking for unique and different zombie picture. Overall, I'd give this a 8.5/10.",/review/rw4193143/?ref_=tt_urv

18 May 2018,neener3707,8," Wow, Pretty Darn Good
","When I saw the trailer I was a little weary about this film. I wasn't sure if it would suck like many other indie epidemic survival movies that have been released in the last 5 years. But thankfully I was not right, this film was very good and not your typical infection film. Its about a couple and their infant child dealing with the end of civilization, where a massive epidemic sweeps across the land. I found this to be less about the disease and more about the relationship between parent and child, and the parent doing absolutely anything to help there baby. This really comes through in the film, you really feel the desperation and love, that often is very intense. Very emotional and had me on the edge of my seat a few times. Not to mention the great acting that only adds to the intensity of any given scene. I've always loved Martin Freeman, another great performance from him.",/review/rw4193143/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2019,AbyGayle-23652,8," Emotional
","A zombie film with feeling, love and emotion. It's good to watch this genre of film made in different ways.
I admit for me it does go on a tad too long, but the ending made up for it.
A well respected and very well made film.",/review/rw4193143/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2018,phenomynouss,2," feature-length film trapped in the shadow of its 7 minute long progenitor
","I had the great fortune of seeing the original short film ""Cargo"" upon which this film is based on. It is 7 minutes long, and it is exactly as long as it needs to be, telling a short, shocking, compelling story of a man in a zombie apocalypse with an infant child and a zombie bite. He roams around as much as he can, while setting up a contraption with a wooden pole holding some meat in front of his face, which serves to keep his zombie self perpetually moving forward to try to get the meat. In the end, he's shot dead by some other survivors, who then discover the baby and take it to safety.",/review/rw4193143/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2018,S_Soma,2," Quality production completely founded on stupid and unbelievable behavior.
","Simply put, CARGO is a zombie picture whose focus is the emotional and interpersonal relationships of the characters surrounding a father's desperate attempts to get his daughter to safety in the context of the inhospitable Australian outback. It's a race against the clock as the father himself is infected and he will soon be the greatest threat of all to his own daughter.",/review/rw4193143/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2018,andrewbunney,8," A smart film recommended for lovers of horror and Australiana
","CARGO is an often tense story of a father's quest to get his infant daughter to safety, set in a post-apocalyptic Australian outback ravaged by an untreatable and highly infectious disease. A couple and their baby daughter are on a houseboat on the River Murray in South Australia, but running low on food as they are surrounded by people who have succumbed to a fast-acting disease that leaves its victims as flesh-eating, slow-moving, un-dead. Desperate to find a foster-carer for baby Rose, a glimmer of hope arrives when a young Aboriginal girl who is trying to save her own father comes on the scene.",/review/rw4193143/?ref_=tt_urv

24 May 2018,3THEREAL,7," A decent zombie flick!
","Cargo is generally enjoyable, but it does manage to drag in small parts. The short film it was based on gets straight to the point and hits at what the heart of this story is. Sometimes, that aspect is lost when you stretch it to a feature-length film, which is what I feel occurred here. There are a few moments in this film that feel like they are there simply to extend the runtime. This happens at times in road trip stories where not every stop along the way feels natural or meaningful. Cargo still earns the Decent Watch rating, and will certainly be better than some of the more hyped Netflix Originals.",/review/rw4193143/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2018,mhorg2018,1," It was better as a short
","The short was very well done. Why? Because it was short. If this had been say, 45 minutes long, it might have been worth seeing - as it is, it's dull and slow. I'm not saying every Zombie movie has to be Night of the Living Dead, nor do they have to have gore, but they have to have SOMETHING. This has the usual stupid act - the Father say's early in the movie that once one is bitten, one has 24-48 hours before turning. (I'm actually very tired of every single zombie bite or scratch being fatal), so what happens? Wife gets bitten and bam, does he let her go off to die or turn? Does he kill her, even though HE KNOWS what will happen? No. He keeps her around so she can bite him. Then he has to find someone to take care of their infant baby - who cries her ass off - surprisingly not attracting any zombies. THe rest is the usual. He goes from situation to situation, meeting a young aborigine who helps him out, as well as another white Australian, who is a bastard. The movie just drags. Not a movie I'll ever watch again.",/review/rw4193143/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2018,tkaine3,9," One of the best storylines for a Z flick top 3 atleast.
","Definitely a warm heartfelt zombie flick maybe top 3 ever as far as engagement, acting and pace.. Purely brilliant writing and the cast delivered on all levels. This movie didn't hinge on having off the wall non believable characters which was refreshing it maintained clarity by igniting believable characters and responses from beginning to end.. I really don't have any qualms with this film I think in todays hollywood era we want super over the top action and spectacles but this film gives you action but stays in the realm of reality...

19 May 2018,AziziOthmanMY,8," simple plot with a satisfied ending
",The movie started a bit slow for the first 30 minutes or so then it establish it self afterward. Martin Freeman quite shines in this movie and convince me of the protagonist hopes and fears. You be rooting for the protagonist along the way. Watched many zombie movies but this one is pretty good. Recommended viewing.,/review/rw4193143/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2018,gustheaffen,3," Another Netflix Unoriginal 'Original' Content full of PC Garbage
","I can't believe the good reviews. First off the story itself is not original! It is just more zombies, people that act completely irrationally and do stupid things and then to add insult to a long boring story where we get the white man is evil and locking up blacks and using them as bait but the blacks save the day at the end. So cliche and just plain bad. 
Story starts with a couple and their baby living in a zombie apocalypse on a boat floating down a river. The woman basically demands her husband go forage for supplies even though they really don't appear to need them that badly and he goes off into an abandoned boat, takes everything he can safely but she becomes obsessed with him shaving and when he falls asleep with their child she sneaks over to the abandoned boat and of course gets attacked. Fortunately she did get that razor she direly needed! No one protecting a child would be this ridiculous. Then when they decide to go inland to find a hospital (clearly those would still be running - eye roll) they run into more trouble, he has the world's lamest auto accident and manages to get bitten by his wife by basically jamming his arm in her mouth. Now we get to the plot of he has less than 2 days to find someone in this rotting world to take care of his baby. And of course that is when he meets a evil white guy locking up blacks and he frees a child that was locked up and they spend the rest of the time trying to get to the tribe who miraculously found paradise which was literally not far since he only had about 1/2 a day to make it there. Really lame, what I have come to expect from Netflix.",/review/rw4193143/?ref_=tt_urv
