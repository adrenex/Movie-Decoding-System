20 September 2003,sol-kay,7," Don't listen to it's critics, see the movie for yourself and come to your own conclusions.
","A Far better movie then it's critics make it out to be. ""The Postman"" is a good solid film about the end of the world and the chaos and confusion that follows with the unwitting soul that destiny choose to bring those who survived the apocalypse back to a better life and promising future.

21 November 1999,TxMike,," A much better movie than the ""user ratings"" would indicate.
","I own this movie on DVD, I've seen this movie a number of times, and it is overall better than 80% of the commercial movies being released these days.",/review/rw4219129/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2000,A-Ron-2,8," Well... I am glad to see that I am not the only person who liked this film
","I truly do NOT understand why The Postman was attacked as viscously as it was by the film media (there films much more worthy of the Golden Raspberry Awards in 1997).  I loved this film and was very impressed with the loving amount of dedication that it demonstrates on the part of the actors, writers and director.  This was a GOOD movie: it had a strong and intelligent story; excellent and interesting characters; and real feel for the post-Apocalypse genre.  I felt that Kevin Costner's everyman act worked beautifully in this film and created a sense of reality for the character and of his situation. ",/review/rw4219129/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2000,gagliano,," First of all...I liked it...I really did!
","First of all...I liked it...I really did! It is a film by Kevin Costner, starring Kevin Costner, surrounds Kevin Costner's character, and a movie that is simply...Kevin Costner. But if you liked Kevin Costner in such films as ""Dances With Wolves"", ""Robin Hood"", ""The Bodyguard"", and even slightly in ""Waterworld"", then you will like this film. I know it is three hours long (I got refills on both the popcorn and super-size soda and still ran out), but I didn't find it as unbearable as those less-than-perfect-movie-critics have claimed. I found the time to go by quite like you would expect three hours to go by and didn't find myself being bored or dozing off. Yes, the story line was a bit predictable and Kevin played the reluctant hero that he is known for...but I liked it. Bottom line...if you want to do something nice for your postman, tell them you are going to go see the film in their honor...because like their motto says...not rain, nor shine, nor sleet, nor nothing...not even the lack of being a country will stop the mail from getting through.",/review/rw4219129/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2021,Fitzy14,7," The Postman Delivers
","Listen I know that Costner has a rep. For long drawn out story lines and his movies can be on the slow side, but give this one a chance, it makes you feel proud at the end and I tell you that you will not feel like you wasted your time and if you do I will refund your money on this review, with your receipt of course.",/review/rw4219129/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2002,tony etchells,9," See it, then decide
","It's a depressing fact that the moviegoing public is being brainwashed by critics to hate everything involving Kevin Costner. When released in 1997 this breathtaking, thought-provoking epic was largely ignored and limped to a box office gross of $14 million, thanks to some vicious reviews.",/review/rw4219129/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2000,KHydak,8," not bad

17 February 2003,professor_asphincter,10," Very unfairly treated movie
","I know a lot of people hated this movie. I know why. It is a little saccharine in places and yes, it is not always believeable. But this is one of the few time a screenplay is better than the book it was based on. This film always fills me with such positive energy and hope. it is funny in places, sad in places, tragic and action-packed in places. Costner plays Eric with such a fresh attitude, and you can almost hear the voices in the characters head pulling his loyalties. The cast is perfect and in many places the cinamatography is sublime. The cross cuts are so clever it made my eyes ache with envy that i didnt think of them and the action sequences are fast and timed to perfection. this remains one of my favourite films and in all honesty people should give it a little more respect. no matter what you think of the script and characterisation technicly this film is top draw. Sets, locations, effects and design grab you by the hand and take you someplace you actually want to go. i would much rather make and see films like this than dross like 'chaicago' and 'moulin rouge'. this is a film for grownups with a bit of imagination and respect for the film makers art.",/review/rw4219129/?ref_=tt_urv

19 July 2020,milligancharm,10," My Favorite Movie
","This is my favorite film of all time. Excellent story, beautiful score, perfect direction and wonderfully acted. The reluctant leader who starts a movement reminds us why people will lay their lives down for the cause of freedom. Especially poignant for today, with all the statues of our leaders and forefathers coming down. Like the postman, no man is perfect. But the ideas that they stand on and promulgate are the only things powerful enough to make humans free against the inertia of tyranny and selfishness. And we would be wise to remember and study those ideas. Watch The Postman again. It is a near-perfect movie from a talented story teller in Kevin Costner.",/review/rw4219129/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2021,jhart05,8," Good movie
","By now most people already know not to believe the so called ""professional critics"". To hell with them giving this movie bad reviews because Costner is a conservative.",/review/rw4219129/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2020,mov13junk13,10," Costner at its best, i enjoy him acting in any postapocalytic movie
","This movie is awesome, i have a thing for postapocalyptic movies especially if they are made great which this one definetly is, i like it equaly as much as waterworld.
Great script, great acting, wonderfully shot with superb sound and cinematography. It has a dancing with the wolves feel to it.",/review/rw4219129/?ref_=tt_urv

9 August 2021,antimatter33,9," David Brin gave it a thumbs up - haters can bite it
","Who, you ask, is David Brin? He is a renowned writer of science fiction who authored the book on which the film is based. Not only did he think the film was an excellent effort, he and Costner collaborated on the moral message the story was meant to convey, and Brin himself was ""ecstatic"" with Costner playing his hero. That's good enough for me.",/review/rw4219129/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2020,sammyk762-50-470681,8," Suddenly very relevant again...
","Nothing to add to the other reviews, other than it holds up well after 20 years, and may even be a better movie for our times than the one it was made. Is it long? Sure. So pause it every 45 minutes and pretend it's a series. It's worth your time, especially if your pandemic watch list is running short.",/review/rw4219129/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2020,Kdosda_Hegen,10," Surprised by all the hate.
","I think this movie is as good as Braveheart or Dances With Wolves. All 3 are historically innacurate, yet it's not their point. Yet, Braveheart and Dances With Wolves received very positive reception by majority of people, but this film, far from that. I love it as much as those other two. The cinematograhy and music is fantastic. The cast was perfect, the story is very interesting. People claim that the tyranny is unrealistic, but they are just too blind to see that the tyranny is already everythere in our world, maybe not in your country, but look in North Korea alone... Most people are sheep and obey. Claiming this film makes people look like sheep makes you blind of our own world.",/review/rw4219129/?ref_=tt_urv

7 June 2008,Robert_duder,9," One of my favorites!! A guilty little pleasure apparently
","Years ago I watched The Postman when it was first released amidst horrifying reviews. I started watching it late one night with the intention of only watching a bit of it and next thing I knew I was wide eyed and hooked on this patriotic post apocalyptic action flick. Granted I have always been a HUGE Kevin Costner fan (MUST SEE MR BROOKS--See my review.) I watched it again in order to review it and was still impressed although the enormous greatness I saw as a teenager had faded a little. I am pleased to see that a lot of IMDb reviewers see this film for what it is and that some people truly see it as a great flick. It has it's moments of really campy special effects, some major over acting, and a really heavy message of United States patriotism which is apparently a bad thing according to some reviewers?! The problem is in a post 9/11 world a lot of people have had their fill of intense, down your throat patriotism but The Postman did it before it was the fad. It still is a beautifully directed, action packed epic with beautiful landscape and a captivating story and some really honest goodness moving moments. The length is a common complaint and yet the length is what makes The Postman epic compared to run of the mill action flick because it doesn't hold back anything to tell it's story.",/review/rw4219129/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2019,damonlaycox,10," Something to Believe In!

28 August 2002,comet_chaser9,10," A Very good post-apocalyptic film
","This film was excellent. The acting ranged from average to good, the fight scenes were convincing, the costume design was superve, and the set design phenomenal. The problem with this film is, that it's sci-fi, and as we all know, sci-fi has that nasty habit of making people think. And hay, who likes to do that nowadays? This film asks the question...what if, right now, all of civilization fell apart. no more super-market, no more police, no more government. The truth of all things would be revealed...money would be just green paper, your television would be a piece of junk, and everything that you lived for would take a back seat to survival. Who would you be? a Warrior, a wonderer, a tyrant, a diplomat? would the meek inhereit the earth? would the rich and powerful be pathetic and powerless when their paper-empires crumble in the nuclear war? and America...would that dream of the land of the free, home of the brave survive after it's government has been destroyed? and who would preserve it? who would insure that after the End, the government of the people, by the people and for the people would not parish from the Earth? would you? This film is a must-see for thinking people...for all you brainless slaves of the critics...stay home and watch Titanick(Hurl!) for the tenth time.",/review/rw4219129/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 1998,Zuria,," Bum Rap
","I found the movie to be better than anticipated (perhaps because I feared the worst, thanks to all the ""anti""hype).  Costner did a great job transforming a hokey script into an attractive film. It's use of symbolism and Shakespearian references were well placed, though seemingly not accepted. This only strengthens the fact that movies ""wax too philosophical"" for the general audience, especially an American audience which usually can't handle any movie beyond 1 and a half hours.  This is why the Action genre is so popular while the Epic genre sees a rare release.  Also, Great scenery and camera work help the story along, not to mention good acting.  In its roots, Postman is an old fashioned movie without the heavy, overdone special effects we badly crave(Armaggedon, Starship Troopers).  The Postman is merely a metaphor for strength, courage and conviction.  The movie could have been about ""The Cook"" and still work as well.  Shame on Hollywood for trashing such a great star!!  (lest we forget the references to ""Kevin's Gate"" during DANCES WITH WOLVES, The negative buzz surrounding ROBIN HOOD, and even WATER WORLD.)    Movies that went on to become hits!!",/review/rw4219129/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Postman got a lot of harsh and bad reviews and for that reason I didn't watch it at the cinema.
