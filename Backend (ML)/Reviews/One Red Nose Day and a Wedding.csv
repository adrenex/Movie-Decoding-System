8 December 1999,gridoon,6," By-the-numbers thriller is boosted by good performances.
","I think most people tend to overlook how well-done the first 20 minutes of this movie really are. Ruben carefully builds a creepy atmosphere, relying on brief glances, moments of silence and quietly expressive performances (especially by Julia Roberts) to help the viewer understand that, behind the image of a perfect couple, something is really wrong. Unfortunately, after Roberts escapes from her husband, the movie turns into a strictly by-the-numbers thriller, where you can predict almost every development of the script. It's a visually polished movie, though, and the very good performances give it a strong psychological center that keeps it above-average.",/review/rw5575523/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2005,JumeirahSun,8," Deleted scene?
","I just bought the DVD of this film and was surprised to find that a graphic scene was removed from the early moments. I remember from seeing the movie in previous times (on television) that when Laura and Martin come home from the party, he begins his little ""love-making"" session. We see from Laura's expression that her husband is really raping her. This scene is not on my DVD; it ends right after Laura drops the bowl of strawberries. Why was the scene taken out for the DVD? Perhaps there are enough other clues to Martin's true nature but it is odd that this scene, which is one of the first to clue the audience in to the menace of the situation, is missing. The implications of Martin's favorite music and the Pavlovian horror it instills in Laura is somewhat cheapened by the deletion of the rape scene. I know that there are sometimes different edits of films when they are released on television, but I would have expected this sex scene to be taken out for TV, and not for the DVD!",/review/rw5575523/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2011,seymourblack-1,7," Things Are Not Always As They Appear To Be
","In ""Sleeping With The Enemy"" things are not always as they appear to be. On the surface, Laura Burney (Julia Roberts) and her husband Martin (Patrick Bergin) are a wealthy and contented couple who enjoy a comfortable lifestyle and spend their leisure time at their luxurious house by the beach at Cape Cod. In reality though, Laura lives in a state of constant fear which has been created by Martin's abusive behaviour.",/review/rw5575523/?ref_=tt_urv

","Laura marries Martin Burney who appears to be the perfect man, he is handsome and successful, yet the dream of the perfect man becomes a nightmare as Martin is a control freak who abuses her both physically and mentally. Once she decides enough is enough she plots her escape by way of faking her own death by drowning, a new life beckons, but she will always be looking over her shoulder to see if Martin finds out the truth and tracks her down.",/review/rw5575523/?ref_=tt_urv

16 March 2006,roghache,6," Haunting, chilling tale of affluent spousal abuse
","I found this movie, if not terribly believable, very moving and emotional when I saw it some years back. Julia Roberts brings a real vulnerability to all her roles, and is perfect here as the affluent but both mentally and physically abused wife.",/review/rw5575523/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2004,david_barnett1,," My First Julia Roberts Movie
","Unlike some, I LIKE this lady and this is my favourite film of hers. After watching it for the nth time I was moved to buy the book on which it is based and this is a far more complex affair than the film, which simplifies everything and leaves out several characters altogether. I think Nancy Price did a far better job of studying an abused wife, who never really stopped loving her brute of a husband, than the makers of the film. It depicts Sara/Laura as a far more interesting character than the somewhat insipid Julia Roberts version.",/review/rw5575523/?ref_=tt_urv

4 January 2005,Beast-5,7," A Lifetime movie from Hell...
","SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY resembles the kind of movie they show endlessly on the Lifetime channel. The men are either weak and ineffectual or psychotic.It was rightfully parodied by the movie FATAL INSTINCT. For the most part, the cheese factor is high, with plot devices scattered about everywhere, as well as a number of holes mentioned in other reviews. The characters act the way they do because the story requires them to do so. The scenery is wonderful, particularly at the beginning with the boats and the ocean. Patrick Bergin is great as Julia Roberts's obsessive-compulsive creep of a husband. Roberts has more chemistry with him than anyone else in the movie...",/review/rw5575523/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2000,burbank904416010,10," A Forgotten Classic
","Why did everyone hate this film? It seems that the press love to hate any Julia Roberts film as quick as possible. I have to admit that I find Julia Roberts a fine actress and Sleeping With The Enemy is a fine example of this. She shines in a compelling and powerful thriller, that despite relying on overused shock tactics, builds up an incredible sense of excitement towards the overwrought finale. The opening scenes are shocking and the escape of the abused wife and the discovery of her husband's reappearance are undeniably moving. A forgotten classic",/review/rw5575523/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2007,preppy-3,5," Thriller that's not too thrilling
","Beautiful Laura Burney (Julia Roberts) is miserable. She lives with a vicious controlling husband (Patrick Bergin) who beats her up for the slightest infraction. She fakes her own death, moves to a small town in Iowa and starts over. She meets nice guy Ben Woodward (Kevin Anderson) and begins to fall in love...but her husband (in an increasingly unbelievable series of events) figures out she's alive and is hunting her.",/review/rw5575523/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2011,Leofwine_draca,5," A solid turn from star Roberts in this wife beater thriller
","One of the best-known entries in the psycho-thriller genre, thanks to the starring presence of Julia Roberts. This time the story is the husband-from-hell, and watching Roberts dealing with him at the film's outset makes for engaging viewing. What follows is entirely predictable and fairly watchable, although it's safe to say that this film is fairly dated â€“ it was made in the early '90s, a period which seems to date films far more than those from a few years before or after, for some reason.",/review/rw5575523/?ref_=tt_urv

5 July 2001,Thornfield2,," LLAAAAUUUURRRRAAAA!!!
","*Minor-spoilers*This movie was creepy to certain degree and it makes a single girl think twice before slipping the noose around her neck. Julia Roberts shines in her performance as the victim Laura and I really enjoyed Kevin Anderson's performance here too, as the guy next door who's trying to help her. But Patrick Bergen's performance was almost a little bit too much for me. Don't get me wrong, he's an incredible actor,and he was very convincing as Laura's sadistic ex-husband, but there were times he would bug out his eyes and do things a little too psyco. Like trying to suffocate Laura's poor blind mother in the rest home. Why? Or methodically planning to get Laura and then blatently attacking some poor schmoe in a parking lot before doing his homework and realizing he was gay and had nothing to do with his wife. Whatever. Some of these scenes were really hammed up to the point of where it was hard not to laugh. Abuse is not laughing matter, but it was the scenes with just Bergen alone and on the hunt for his long lost wife that were near crack ups.",/review/rw5575523/?ref_=tt_urv

15 September 2019,Tweekums,7," Not too many surprises but a solid enough drama
","Outwardly it would appear that Laura and Martin Burney have a perfect marriage in their beachfront property on Cape Cod, but looking closer it becomes apparent that he is controlling and abusive. Everything in the house must be just so; she wears what he wants her to wear and as he tells a neighbour he likes to get her out on the ocean at least once each season... despite her being terrified of water due to a near fatal childhood incident. That night Laura and Martin join their neighbour for a sail; the weather turns bad and she disappears overboard. She is assumed drowned but, as we soon learn, she has been planning for this moment. With Martin thinking she is dead she starts a new life in Iowa. Unfortunately a series of events leads him to suspect the truth; then it is only a matter of time before he finds her.",/review/rw5575523/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2003,Theo Robertson,4," Never Marry Herr Hitler
","I couldn`t help noticing that many people in the opening credits who made this film had Jewish sounding names . I didn`t think too much of it at the time but as SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY progressed I couldn`t fail to notice that the villain is softly spoken and is capable of as much charm as he is of flying into extreme rage , listens to teutonic music , is obsessed with regimentation , doesn`t smoke and believes in the virtues of a health regime. Did I mention he`s got a moustache ? Good job the bad guy isn`t called Adolph `cos that`d be too obvious so the writers give him the non third Reich sounding name of Martin otherwise women everywhere might think it`s a good idea marrying someone with all the character traits of Adolph Hitler . Hey wait a minute ! Wasn`t Martin Burney Hitler`s private secretary ?",/review/rw5575523/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2008,Mr_PCM,6," Industry standard thriller only raised by Roberts' presence
","One of many standard thrillers that were scattered through the late 80s and early 90s, many of which would star Julia Roberts, and which showed her to be more than just the pretty romantic lead. Here she plays a much stronger character, a woman fleeing her abusive husband to start a new life, strong, independent but still skittish, worried that she might be found.",/review/rw5575523/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2020,kosmasp,6," Issues
","Abusive relationships are quite the problem. Especially because women have problems to get out of them. Now the fact Julias character can do that ... well seemingly can do that, is a nice things. Although her approach or the way she achieves it, is quite riddled with holes (planning wise). There are also a lot of other convenient things (ring in the toilet, phone call, visit at a certain facility at the exact same time and so forth) that happen, that normally should make you cringe in terror.",/review/rw5575523/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2007,inkblot11,9," Uber-powerful story of domestic violence and its effects
","Laura (Julia Roberts) appears to be the luckiest bride on the planet. Her husband (Patrick Bergen) is a very successful financial adviser and they have two beautiful homes, one on the eastern seaboard. She has lovely clothing and every imaginable amenity. However, appearances are deceiving. Shortly after a happy honeymoon, her husband revealed his true nature. He is a sadistic, sociopathic control freak who beats her if she so much as leaves a handtowel hanging lower than the others. He also demands sex whenever he is in the mood and never takes no for an answer. Sadly, there is no escape, as he often warns her that he can track her down anywhere, should she decide to leave him. However, Laura is desperate to get out of his clutches, naturally, so she bravely devises a plot to vanish into thin air, or that is, into the water. Her husband believes that she is afraid of the ocean but she secretly takes swimming lessons and uses her new skills to fake her own drowning when she falls off the side of a boat. Escaping to Iowa, Laura begins a new life as Sarah Waters. She even finds a kind and caring man, Ben (Kevin Anderson) living right next door to her newly rented home. But, should Laura really be confident that her crazy ex will never find out about her deception? Don't count on it! This is a powerful story of domestic abuse and its consequences. It is very difficult to entangle oneself from an abusive partner, as this film clearly shows, and those who are brave enough to try should be mightily applauded and supported. Bergen is one of the most lethal, frightening characters ever put up on the screen and his performance towers over nearly everything else. That said, Roberts is really terrific, too, as the caught-in-a-trap woman and Anderson is nice, also, as a measure of hope in her dark world. The costumes are most lovely and the film's sets beautiful, especially those in Iowa. For the record, Robert's rented home is one of the most beautiful abodes in film history and it is my personal favorite among houses. I sometimes play the film just to see the home's lovely interior and exterior. But, to get back on track, this film is a riveting piece of fiction that seems all too real, with a powerful, uber-suspenseful plot line. If you love scary, shake-my-bones mysteries, you hardly do better than this one. But, sleeping afterwards could be a short-term hazard.",/review/rw5575523/?ref_=tt_urv
