21 April 2002,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," Oh, no, not another teen movie! *pause* oh, this is actually funny? Coolness!
","Not Another Teen Movie, like Scary Movie, this is a parody of what the 1990's had to offer us, the romantic teen comedies! How many of them do we loathe? But how many were also great? Not Another Teen Movie makes fun of movies from the 80's to the 90's and is very clever. I saw this movie with a friend and honestly, while there are a few parts that were a little too much for me, I don't exactly dig potty humor, but there are some really funny scenes. It was fun to see someone finally make fun of the all the clichés that were rubbed in our faces: the nerdy girl turning into the hot girl, clichéd characters that would never be friends but somehow are, the best friend in love with the other friend who's in love with the popular kid, you get the drill.",/review/rw5722073/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2020,troy-daniel-bush,8," This. Is. Awesome.
","It's gross, stupid, and raunchy and I love it! And you can tell that everyone involved had a great time, and that just adds to the experience. It also helps that I am a fan of a few of the movies that they make fun of like Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club. And even the stuff that isn't exactly funny gets a laugh out of me because it's all over-the-top in the best way.",/review/rw5722073/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2006,bdubstater4,8," none of the modern spoofs are masterpieces, this one is the best
","The days of Airplane and Naked Gun are over. Nowadays, we have the Scary Movies, Spy Hard, Date Movie, Not Another Teen Movie, etc....of all of these, Teen Movie is quite easily the best one. The point of spoofs and satires, to me, are not just to take familiar scenes and do something retarded and gross with them, but instead to actually make fun of all the things in the original movies that, while watching them, we all turned to our friends and said ""wait a minute, thats kind of stupid"". Teen Movie does this extremely well. How many of us lucky movie fans who saw She's All That had trouble seeing why everyone in the movie thought the lead actress was ugly just because she had glasses and a ponytail? She was still a babe! How many of these teen movies give the main lead actress a friend who is clearly into her, but she always seems to ignore any possibility of romance between them, instead pursuing another character and asking for her friend's help/advice? How many people thought the characters in Cruel Intentions were just sexually over the top to the point of being absurd? Teen Movie pokes great fun at all of these flaws. It is, unlike many other movies that attempt to be like it, a true satire, taking characters and not just doing stupid things with them, but exaggerating the traits of their serious counterparts and, when it comes down to it, just making fun of them. It has surprisingly good plot cohesion while still making fun of a variety of teen movies. I suppose the best way to distinguish this movie from all other modern spoofs is that this one is truly intelligent. Sure it has some stupid jokes, and toilet humor (that I admit I chuckled at in disgust like the diarrhea scene and the lesbian kiss with the old woman), but it also has some very clever jokes, like when is it appropriate to start a slow clap, why do these teen movies seem to only have one black character, and how silly is it that things slow down for emphasis when the beautiful female lead enters the room. Please, give this one a chance. If you've seen the other modern spoofs, I'm confident you will appreciate the noticeable and subtle differences between them and Teen Movie that make the latter much more enjoyable and palatable to watch.",/review/rw5722073/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2004,robc-11,," Absolutely Hilarious!
","I believe that perhaps a lot of the criticisms of this film come from 90's-00 teens because THEY JUST DON'T GET IT! Most of the comedy in this film spoofs 1980's movies, with a few current barbs thrown in from more recent films. I am an 80's child, and I laughed so hard during this movie! I saw it with younger kids from the mid-to-late 90's, and they didn't get half of the jokes. The school cafeteria is named ""The Anthony Michael Dining Hall."" The school is ""John Hughes High School."" There are send-ups of ""Risky Business,"" ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"" ""Pretty In Pink,"" ""Sixteen Candles,"" and an absolutely priceless scene that spoofs ""The Breakfast Club,"" along with the original ""Breakfast Club"" principal, Richard Vernon, spouting almost exactly the same dialogue. Sure, there are much more recent films that are skewered, such as ""Varsity Blues,"" (which was HORRIBLE) and ""She's All That,"" (Which was EVEN WORSE.) There's an hilarious running gag spoofing ""Cruel Intentions,"" in which the slutty sister will stop at nothing to bed her brother, high school football hero Jake Wyler, who makes a bet with his team members that he can turn plain-jain, boy-hating Janie Griggs into the prom queen. Sex jokes and excrement jokes run rampant, all hilarious. Jamie Pressly, who you might remember from Jerry Springer's movie ""Ringmaster,"" is a total riot as head cheerleader Priscilla, who schemes to copy cheers from a rival school's all-black cheerleading squad, spoofing ""Bring It On."" And the siamese twins who win Homecoming Queen(s) is an absolute riot, especially when homecoming king Jake has to share a dance with them and the band sings ""Put your heads on my shoulder...."" TOO FUNNY! A hilarious movie, especially if you're high or drunk, and you KNOW what they are spoofing.",/review/rw5722073/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2005,PurplePanther,10," Beyond Ridiculous, But Genuinely Hilarious.
","I have to say, I didn't expect much from this film. Basically ""Scary Movie"" spoofing teen classics instead of horror films. I watched it and actually liked it. Yes, this film could possibly be qualified as one of the silliest movies of the decade, but that's sort of the point. This movie had laughing so hard I was gasping for breath. The humor is juvenile, but FUNNY. The plot is stupid, but HILARIOUS. It's really fun to stop and say ""Hey, that 10 Things About You!"" or ""Oh, they're doing Can't Hardly Wait"". This film is probably one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time, it's not for everybody, but it's a good movie.",/review/rw5722073/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2002,Marc42,," Much better than expected
","While it fails almost as often as it succeeds, there's so much going on here I couldn't help but like it. You REALLY have to be familiar with the material being spoofed, though.  And part of the fun is ticking them all off in your mind if you're a movie geek like me.",/review/rw5722073/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2005,theonlyidleft,8," Certainly not a bad film
","The IMDb ranking for this film is quite harsh in my opinion. OK, this film was never going to win an Oscar, but it's enjoyable throughout and has some very good laughs in it. I'm not a big fan of teen movies but I saw this and was impressed. It's light-hearted and not afraid to appear ridiculous (infact most of the time it does this deliberately) and it doesn't pretend to be ""Just another teen movie"", indeed it IS ""Not another teen movie"", it's a very enjoyable laugh at the expense of those films.",/review/rw5722073/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2004,robc-11,," Funny! Funny! Funny!
","I can't understand why this film got such bad reviews. This is a knee-slapping riot! I have just about memorized the script. I was a teen in the 80's and grew up with John Hughes movies...""Breakfast Club,"" ""Sixteen Candles,"" ""Pretty In Pink,"" etc. ""Not Another Teen Movie"" is absolutely hilarious. The high school in the film is ""John Hughes High,"" complete with the cafeteria named ""The Anthony Michael Dining Hall."" Most all of the dialogue is priceless. There's an undercover narc who is a 70 year-old woman. The foreign exchange student is always completely nude; she explains to the principal that she is not in America to study, she just wants to be ""an object of lust for nerds who can not get American pussy."" There are many classic bits, such as when the popular school jock, Jake, tries to woo nerdy Janie Briggs by belting out ""Janie's Got A Gun"" by Aerosmith. Jake means well, but cops attack Janie with a stun gun and scream at her to surrender her weapon. There's also a hilarious spoof of ""Grease"" in which all of the characters sing and perform a highly choreographed dance to ""Prom Tonight!"" (""I'm gonna get pussy no matter what..even if it's with dirty slut!"") In a wicked parody of ""Cruel Intentions,"" Mia Kirshner, as Catherine, is always trying to have sex with her brother Jake. (She wails ""So what if we have the same mother! Tonight I'm gonna f**k my brother!) No teen film is spared. This hilarious movie lampoons all of the classic teenage films. Slutty Catherine gets tipsy at the prom, slugging booze out of her flask, while kids look at her and say ""Does she go to this school?"" Catherine hooks up with one of the nerds and she cries as she exclaims that ""all she wants is for a guy to take a dump on her chest."" The nerd tells her that he is shocked that no guy has ever taken a dump on her chest and tells Catherine that he would be honored to do so. I could go on and on, but trust me, NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE is HILARIOUS! Deleriously funny! And watch for Randy Quaid as an alcoholic father who loves to have sex with pies. A COMEDY CLASSIC!",/review/rw5722073/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2004,richard-j-hilliard,," It helps if you've seen all of the movies it mimics.
",I hate it when people make comments about these sorts of films saying that the story line is loose or vague or it has no real plot. The only reason for these films to have any sort of plot is to direct the jokes. I believe this films primary purpose is to make the viewer laugh and it does so in abundance. I went to see the film with an open mind not expecting to be blown away with a fantastic performance from the lead character or be intrigued by its deep and complex story line - its a light hearted no-brainer that does its job.,/review/rw5722073/?ref_=tt_urv

23 April 2004,Idolprincess,," Not so bad.
","This is the type of movie that people instantly judge because of it's popularity. Teen movies have always been considered awful by a lot of critics and a lot of movie fans. Several people are annoyed to death by teen movies and dislike the overused stereotypes that they contain. Is it that annoyance that created this movie? Most people would say it isn't, and that it's just another reason to make another blockbuster teen movie. Personally, I think we'll never know.",/review/rw5722073/?ref_=tt_urv

15 September 2005,elzbone,10," Everything The Scary Movie Trilogy Lacked
","These kids attend John Hughes High. Brilliant! This movie hit what is wrong with most teen-angst films from the 80s on. Almost every single one has a Pygmalion-esquire plot line where the geeky girl (sometimes boy) is made over so they can fit in with the elite group of rich and popular kids. They've addressed all the clichés, and how unlike high school these movies really are. Think about it, to be popular means to be liked by a lot of people. And who likes the snotty brat who thinks she is prettier than everyone else? I attended several different high schools around the U.S., and these girls exist, but they don't get named prom queen.",/review/rw5722073/?ref_=tt_urv

28 July 2019,ildudeentertainment,9," Not Another Bad Parody
","In recent years the slapstick comedy genre has slowly died out and for good reason, most of them are god awful. Now, I'm not going to say this movie should be up for an Oscars (or rather it shouldn't have been) but seeing as it's a comedy it definitely does it's job, ""Not Another Teen Movie"" (2001) is a hilariously good comedy.
As the name suggests the movie parodies a variety of coming of age and teen movies, as well as common high school tropes. Unlike a lot of modern parody movies, many of the gimmicks in this actually feel like parodies of what they're making fun of, allowing the audience to be in on the joke rather than just merely referencing the source material and thinking that's the joke. Sure it relies on a handful of overly gross or raunchy jokes for shock value but for the most part the movie is genuinely charming and has me laughing from beginning to end. As a big fan of John Hughes and other coming of age films, I loved watching all of the iconic moments and cliches have there flaws pointed out or turned on their heads. While I think this definitely adds to the enjoyment, I feel that even just a basic level of knowledge on being a teenager is enough to get you through it highly entertained (source: many of my friends not knowing half the references, and still deciding to watch it every time we hang out).
The core films getting parodied in the movie are ""She's All That"" (1999) and ""American Pie"" (1999) with a helpful dose of ""Cruel Intentions"" (1999) and ""Pretty in Pink"" (1986). It follows Jake Wyler a popular jock played by Chris Evans as he tries to turn the nerdy rebellious girl Jamie Briggs played by Chyler Leigh into the prom queen. Due to the fact that it's a parody, the movie isn't exactly original in its plot, but that's not the point of a parody movie so to judge it on that fact would be unfair. I will, however, say that the writers did a very good job of stitching many iconic scenes from countless teen movies into one cohesive story. I've seen this movie about twenty times (maybe more) and can't think of a scene that felt thrown in or like a cutaway gag. That's not to say that some jokes are a tad random or out of the blue, but you gotta give credit where credit is due.
Then there's the cast, which is mostly filled with now recognizable actors just starting out, but they're all incredibly funny the chemistry between the actors might not be the greatest in the world, but each individual performance is remarkably funny. It's interesting how they're able to embody the character from the source material, all while giving it their own charm and comedic twist. Chris Evans, for example, us hilariously funny as a spoof of Freddie Prince Jr, and I kind of wish he got the chance to be in more comedic roles.
I feel that a lot of times when you watch a movie, it's easy to pick up on actually film techniques that cause a movie to the impressive and forget that the point of art is to accomplish a specific goal, and a comedies job is to cause people to laugh. This is a comedy true and through, as long as you find slapstick parodies funny. Definitely give the movie a watch, it's honestly my favorite comedy of all time and even one of my favorite movies. I would give it a 9/10 as it accomplishes all that it sets out to do, and is definitely Not Another Bad Parody.",/review/rw5722073/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2006,Sandcooler,8," What the hell, this one's actually funny
","It has been quite a while ago since I saw a parody this funny, it's like this one actually had writers. This movie kinda mocks every movie with teens in it ever made and does a fine job of it. Till it gets near the ending, because the Molly Ringwald cameo is just really not funny and doesn't work. The rest of the movie however, is a hilarious collection of stupid obvious jokes. You know which gag is going to appear where, but you still laugh for some reason. The most important thing about a parody is to at least stick to one story. Even if it is the absolute least serious movie ever made, don't make the plot go everywhere. And if there's time write some funny jokes too. It makes the crazy amount of references seem very spontaneous. For a recent spoof this is pretty impressive.",/review/rw5722073/?ref_=tt_urv

4 December 2003,bladespinner,," This is the best comedy i've seen in years
","This movie has made me laugh so hard, i started coughing and almost coughed my lungs out.  First let me say that the movie has a ton of crude and distasteful humor which i could certainly do without, however no matter how crude or distasteful that humor might be to myself it is still neccessary. Why?  Because what i find funny somebody else may think is stale.  Granted most people find a scene where a toilet that has erupted feces all over a classroom is too much.  However maybe there is still the ever watchful 3 percenters out their that need a quick fix, and managed to giggle when they saw it.  So all i'm really saying is that the movie covers all bases(caters to the whole audience and keeps everybody entertained).  They have mild humor(The kind that watches cheers,cosbys,roseanne, and friends) and excessive humor(The kind of audience that only appreciates MTV's jackass,beavis and butthead).  Now that being said, I think the movie was better than awesome.  It was a single achievement in that it successfully made fun at every teen flick from the span of the 80's till today.  It was an extremely funny piece of work.  I am really impressed with the actors and actresses, because they played their parts perfectly.  Trust me there is no movie to date that even comes close to pulling off what this movie did. This movie damn well deserves a sequel, and i don;t mean straight to video either.  This should have gotten the comedy of the year award.  Scary movie 1 was good.  Scary Movie 2 was better.  NATM eats them for breakfast.",/review/rw5722073/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've just watched this on DVD, the reason I found out about it is that I recently did some research on Chyler Leigh (I consider myself to be heavily involved with SUPERGIRL's episode entries, I'm providing many of the quotes), decided I wanted to see her where she is still young, that instantly led to the Marilyn Manson music video and from there to this. I opted for the way more expensive set to have the music video included, even though I had it downloaded. All the time, I knew damn well I was probably gonna fall flat on my face with this as well, for if you encounter during your research here on IMDb those warnings by irate viewers, watch out...! Several times I have told myself, hell, you were warned... but you didn't listen...! The trailer with the long legs and high-heeled feet lured me in. I'm a sucker for that!

I even liked the chracters names, like ""The Token Black Guy,"" ""The Bitchy Cheerleader,"" ""The Foreign Exchange Student"" (she walks around completely naked throughout the whole movie), ""The Stupid Fat Guy,"" and lots more.

","I avoided this movie like the plague back when it came out -- I just assumed it was going to be awful, as by the early 2000s spoof movies were in serious decline. But I finally gave it a go here 7-8 years later or whatnot, and I have to say that I missed out. There HAVE been a ton of really terrible spoof movies in recent years -- the whole Epic Movie/Date Movie crew, what's left of the Wayans brothers etc. -- but this one was really quite funny. It steals its plot from the ridiculous She's All That, but manages to take shots at the silly clichés from almost every teen movie of the last 20 years (or at least the 20 years before this one came out). Its often clever in its parodies, but its also raunchy as hell, which is either a plus or a minus depending on how delicate you are. As I am pretty much impossible to offend, it was a big plus, and let the movie just go for things that a little kiddie PG-13 film would never have dreamed of touching.",/review/rw5722073/?ref_=tt_urv
