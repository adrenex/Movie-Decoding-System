13 May 2006,ccthemovieman-1,7," Arnold Knew How To Make Entertaining Films
","A decade ago, this Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick was fairly hot stuff but I wonder if it would have the impact today since special effects are so much better and we've seen so many of these type of action stories in the past 10 years.",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2015,SnoopyStyle,7," good action, fair body count but needs better wisecracks
","US Marshal John Kruger (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is an expert at erasing identities at WITSEC. Chief Beller (James Coburn) assigns Lee Cullen (Vanessa Williams) to him. She's a whistle-blower at defense contractor Cyrez Corporation. After getting the evidence for the government, she is resistant to WITSEC and killers come after her with high-tech weapons. Fellow Marshal Robert DeGuerin (James Caan) tells Kruger that someone is killing witnesses.",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv

19 August 2021,paulclaassen,7," Exciting, fast-paced action thriller.
","At the height of his action superstar career, Arnold Schwarzenegger's movies were all about guns and explosions. 'Eraser' delivers both in abundance.",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2002,Bogey Man,7," Exciting action with Arnold
","Chuck Russel's Eraser is exploding and intense action film starring Arnold Scwarzenegger as secret government officer, who ""erases"" people i.e. destroys their past in order to save their future. He gets to erase an important witness (Vanessa Williams) who knows about her company's illegal activities as it sells guns to foreigners. The film is full of action and mayhem, which is great since hardboiled action films are not made too often in Hollywood anymore.",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2008,poolandrews,7," One of Arnie's classic no-brainer shoot-'em-ups.
","Eraser starts as weapons manufacturer Cyrez executive Lee Cullen (Vanessa Williams) steals some important data for the FBI to help prove that hi-tech weaponry developed for the US military is being sold to foreign terrorists. Cullen is caught on CCTV cameras stealing the information & the people behind the plan want her dead, in steps witness protection agent & US Marshal John Kruger (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who is a specialist is 'erasing' the lives of the people he is trying to protect & relocate. As the stakes get higher & a lot of very important & dangerous people are implicated by the information Cullen has they have to get at John to reveal where she is, but John is the best there is & intends to bring the bad guy's down & save the life of Cullen...",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2008,TimBoHannon,7," Arnold Satisfies Once Again
","After Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1997 heart surgery, his box office popularity faded. 1996's ""Kindergarten Cop"" is a comedy, and he did not play the lead role in ""Batman and Robin,"" even though his name grabbed him top billing. That makes ""Eraser"" his last great action film until ""Terminator 3"" became his last hurrah, for now anyway. Schwarzenegger plays John Kruger, ""The Eraser."" He puts the protection in the Witness Protection Program.",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2016,Leofwine_draca,6," The dodgy effect here and there, but this Schwarzenegger vehicle is good fun
","A super-slick slice of action, starring the reliable Arnie. This fast-paced flick has a lot bigger budget than Arnie's '80s offerings but it's not quite as enjoyable, despite an eye-popping array of visual effects and non-stop action sequences. There's a clinical detachment to this film, mainly due to the 'seen it all before' feel, as nothing really proves memorable or fresh.",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2004,thegouch23,8," Rock 'em sock 'em cinema
","Eraser is a film typical of its genre. What genre, you ask? Why, the ""the terrorists-are-coming-and-it's one-man-against-the-world-so-shoot-em-up, blow-em-up, and save-the-girl-and-the-day"" genre, of course. Too complicated for you? Don't worry, because the movie isn't. As a matter of fact, it's readily accessible to anyone over the age of 7 - not that this movie is age-appropriate for everyone over the age of 7 (Note: This was my favorite movie when I was 10) - but rather that the concepts, and thus the plot, are simple. This isn't a movie you go see if you're seeking a two hour thinking experience.",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2000,Xophianic,9," One of my favorite Schwarzenegger movies!
","For the most part, I'm a Schwarzenegger fan, although I may never forgive him for his role in BATMAN AND ROBIN. ERASER is one of my favorites of his movies. I think it ranks right up there with the TERMINATOR movies and TRUE LIES. The plot, I think, is better in this movie than in most of Schwarzenegger's movies, and of course the action does not disappoint.",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2020,monkeysgalore,8," One of Arnie's Most Underrated Action Vehicles
","I again want to give this the full five, but not sure. I don't get why more people don't like this. It's so underrated, and yet it's everything people love about Arnold and his movies. Loud, big, violent action, cheesy one-liners, a good villain, and this time it even has entertainingly bad CGI an Vanessa Williams, which are two things I'm always down with watching.
Mm",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2009,lastliberal,7," We're way beyond bullshit here.
","With an Oscar nomination for sound effects an award for music, this is no B-movie. It is Schwarzenegger in one of his best film roles.",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2011,ebiros2,8," One of Arnie's best
","With 20 years of acting experience under his belt, Arnold has become a really good actor, and it shows in this movie. This movie was made when he was in his prime, and is one of the best movie he's done to this date.",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2000,claudonio,7," Better than I remember
","I just saw ""Eraser"" again, and I am suprised to find that I enjoyed it more than when I saw it before. It Delivers thrills, laughs and lot of action. Schwarzenegger is not Robert DeNiro, but he is likeable in his role here. The story is intriguing: A U.S. Marshall that erases peoples identities. This is not Schwarzengger's best movie but it is definitly worth a look.",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2018,dworldeater,7," ""You have been erased"".
","Eraser was a return to form for action star Arnold in Eraser, a box office hit and his best action movie since Total Recall. Eraser is big budget 90's action with an A list cast, high tech weapons, a fast pace and packed with action. James Caan is an excellent villain and Vanessa Williams is hot to trot as the damsel in distress. The stuntwork and action was done well and the film as a whole is pretty tight and well made with a plot twist here and there as well as a little comic relief. Eraser is a pretty good choice for an evening's entertainment and a good 90's action movie.",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2009,hitchcockthelegend,7," Possibly the last true entertaining Arnie picture.
","John Kruger is an Eraser, he works for the witness relocation program as a U.S. Marshal, he will erase your past to protect your future. His latest assignment is to hide and relocate Lee Cullen, a high level executive with a U.S. weapons manufacturer. Cullen is to testify against the Cyrex Corporation for treason crimes appertaining to the corporations weapons manufacturing, but the level of badness extends far beyond a mere few corporate big wigs. John and Lee are in a fight for their lives, and Kruger will need every ounce of his expertise to see them safely thru the ordeal.",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2007,Anonymous_Maxine,7," Who's the tree trunk?
","By this point in Arnold's career he had long since surpassed the low-budget, bad action movie phase, although there are certainly some elements of that phase that he never quite left behind. Eraser is a polished, fast-paced action film that reminds me of some of the highlights of Michael Bay's or Jerry Bruckheimer's careers. Maybe Eraser isn't THAT big, but it's definitely that GOOD. It's a smart return to what Arnold does best, run around with a massive gun in each hand and blow stuff up. It's little more than a high-octane action film, but it's a smart one and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. ",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2017,Sandcooler,8," Ridiculous, but loads of fun
","""Eraser"" isn't quite as insane as ""Commando"" because let's face it, no movie will ever be. But still, it strikes exactly the right tone you need in a Schwarzenegger movie. Arnold goes from one over-the-top action set piece to another, jumping out of planes, strolling through gunfire and even feeding villains to some terrible CGI crocodiles at one point. It's old school action at its finest, with Schwarzenegger chewing the scenery like only he can. Obviously, ""Eraser"" isn't perfect. For one thing, it's glaringly obvious who the 'leak' is within Arnold's squad, but somehow the makers still treat it like it's a huge reveal that you could have never seen coming. Also, Vanessa Williams gives a very flat performance as the damsel in distress, so you don't care much whether she stays alive or not. However, these flaws don't really hurt the overall experience.",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2007,jeff7540,7," Another good Arnold Schwarzenegger movie
",the story goes as follows Lee Cullen a worker for Cyrez Corporation which develops top secret weapons stumbles upon illegal arms deals and acquires the information and barley escapes with help from the F.B.I and is then placed under the protection of U.S Marshell John Kruger who erases the past of witnesses under Witness Protection to give them a future Lee however has been targeted by terrorists to cover up the scam and John Kruger is being targeted by some of his fellow US Marshells and is framed for murder now he has to protect Lee prove his innocence and exposes the illegal arms deal before it happens. I give Eraser seven out of ten because its one of Arnolds best movies of the late 1990's just see it for yourself to believe it.,/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2015,tarbosh22000,9," Arnie Action All the Way!
","U.S. Marshal John Kruger (Arnie, who is credited simply as ""Eraser"" in the end credits) is...an eraser, a man who works for WITSEC, or ""Witness Security"", erasing the identities of people in the Witness Relocation Program so baddies won't find them and kill them. No one is better than Kruger at what he does, but he faces his toughest challenge yet when he's assigned to protect Lee Cullen (Williams), a woman on the run. After working with the FBI on a sting operation involving illegal gunrunning - especially as it relates to a high-tech new EMP gun - now all sorts of bad guys are after her, from corrupt U.S. bureaucrats to the Russian Mafia. (Not to be confused with Roma Maffia, who's in the movie). Kruger's rival is his former compatriot DeGuerin (Caan), who is a formidable nemesis, but Kruger's got plenty of tricks up his sleeve besides erasing people, as we'll clearly see. Will DeGuerin and the other baddies get ERASED...permanently? Eraser is probably one of the last, best Arnold movies. It's a fitting way to unofficially wrap up the ""Golden Age"" of his career of the 80's and 90's, because the movie is pure Hollywood ridiculous action in true Schwarzenegger style. It truly is an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, a genre unto itself, if that makes any sense. You pretty much have to love it. It's nice to see a younger, thinner, more agile Arnie, along with his unmistakable voice. Of course, he gets many classic one-liners to cap off many sequences. The fact that Kruger is supposed to be a U.S. Marshal, but becomes an unkillable superhero who for all intents and purposes can fly and survive grievous injuries with ease, is an oversight of the best kind, something the audience has to go with and couldn't do without, unless they wanted a much less entertaining movie.",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2002,Movie Nuttball,10," One of Arnold`s best!
","In my opinion 1996 was one of the biggest years ever for movies. Eraser is on of Arnold`s best pictures. It has alot stars and action! It Stars the huge Arnold,James Caan,the beautiful Vanessa Williams,the vertern actors James Coburn and Andy Romano,Robert Pastorelli,bad guys Patrick Kilpatrick and Sven-Ole Thorsen, and the legendary actor James Cromwell. It has a good story and it really has some great scenes including the air plane and zoo scenes! The music by Alan Silvestri in it is pretty good! I think this is one of his best movies and all Arnold fans should check this one out!",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv

7 May 2012,CuriosityKilledShawn,7," Those things on the end of pencils.
","The 2-year gap between True Lies and Eraser forced some action fans into thinking that Big Arn had retired. He had delivered at least one action movie per year since Terminator. Eraser had an awesome trailer, to the tune of Enigma's wonderful ""I Love You, I'll Kill You"", that rocked my world in the summer of 1996. I saw virtually every blockbuster that year, and the Eraser trailer was attached to every one of them. It came out out in the UK in the very last week of summer (and my first week back at school). I saw it at the now demolished UCI cinema in Edinburgh with a sold-out audience, mostly filled with guys out for a ""lad's night"". The movie was rated 18, and even though I was 3 years below that mark, I still got in, which was fortunate since the cinema version is the only uncut version of the film that has ever been released in the UK. For its VHS and DVD release the mad BBFC saw fit to cut 4 minutes from Eraser, turning it into an incomprehensible mess. It capped-off an awesome summer season (or so my 15-year-old self thought), and put to rest any fears that Big Arn was slowing down (although he has only made 5 action movies, to date, since then).",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2021,Thanos_Alfie,6," Nice plot...
","""Eraser"" is an Action - Thriller movie in which we watch a man who is a specialist on erasing people identities trying to protect the life of a Witness Protection worker but also his from some people that are involved on a special weapon.",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2010,ctomvelu1,7," Only some bad CGI slows things down
","Watching ERASER again recently, I can truthfully say Ah-nuld still had what it took as late as 1996. And with veteran action director Chuck Russell at the helm, we are presented with a slam-bang action movie that cooks, although it is not as well-executed as action movies of the 1980s. Ah-nuld is a federal officer hiding a very important crime witness (Vanessa Williams). Corrupt fellow officer James Caan is after her, along with about 200 other bad guys. The plot is silly, but the action sequences are for the most part rip-roaring. Some bad CGI intrudes from time to time. but that's about the worst that can be said of this fast-paced flick. Watch for several familiar faces in smaller roles, including the late, great Robert Pastorelli.",/review/rw2207362/?ref_=tt_urv
