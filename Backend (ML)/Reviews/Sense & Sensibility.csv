10 March 2018,searchanddestroy-1,9," Richard Matheson meets Georges Romero...
","Or, if you prefer LAST MAN ON EARTH meets NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Two films which are some kind of cousins. We could also speak of THE OMEGA MAN? another version of the Dick Matheson's novel. I love this small French movie, very cheap but so free from those f... producers. It's of course a zombie film, with pretty interesting lines about loneliness and communication. Especially the one between the lead and an old zombie locked in an old elevator. You also have here some moving sequences, such as this one when the main character takes care of two corpses, man and wife, altogether in their room. Poignant sequence. One thing I don't understand: when the main character finds a long barrel gun, why does he suddenly have a short barrel gun a few minutes later? Did I miss something? 
besides this, I highly recommand this pretty little gem. Thumbs up folks;",/review/rw8518907/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2018,claudio_carvalho,6," Robinson Crusoe in a Zombie Post-Apocalypse World
","In Paris, Sam (Anders Danielsen Lie) goes to the apartment of his ex-girlfriend to take his tapes back. She is giving a party and asks Sam to go to an isolated room to seek the box with his tapes. He falls asleep on a couch and in the morning he finds the apartment and walls covered with stains of blood. Soon he learns that everybody was murdered by zombies. Sam looks for supplies in the building and barricades himself in a safe apartment. Sam realizes that there are only living dead on the street. As the days go by, Sam survives but feels lonely. Until the day he meets Sarah (Golshifteh Farahani), when he realizes that he is also losing his sanity.",/review/rw8518907/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2018,matahari20-1,," This is actually quite good
","I just finished this. I very much enjoyed it. The undead in this are some of the creepiest in the genre because of their utter silence. The character of Sam really drew me in. You feel very much for him and he manages to portray just about every human emotion there is extremely well while finding ways to survive alone in the desert of death, horror and loss around him. This survival is not just about food and ravenous flesh-eating zombies. There are some small and brilliant experimental music scenes created when Sam finds ingenious ways to relieve his boredom and loneliness. He's obviously a musician . He plays drums amazingly too. 
 There is a twist in there too. I don't want to give anything away except to say I didn't see it coming at all. 
There were many sad scenes. Some achingly sad. And a few humorous ones. 
Overall, this is an unexpected gem. Kudos!",/review/rw8518907/?ref_=tt_urv

","For starters, the zombies are totally, utterly mute. Believe or not, it's quite scary! In the real world, a simple cough would get anybody killed in an instant... More generally, one of the most powerful features of this movie is the strength of the overwhelming silence: in the streets, buildings, cars, rooms, hallways...

14 June 2019,mhorg2018,3," Could have been better.
","This started out well, but, as with most zombie movies (and this is getting really annoying) we learn nothing of why or how this plague started. I'm a little tired of that tired plot line. The best thing about this was the zombies themselves. While i can't stand running/fast zombies (and 28 Days Later, great as it is - is not a zombie movie. The infected in that are alive. And far easier to kill.) the zombies in this are absolutely silent. That makes them way more creepy than groaning, moaning zombies. That's the best part of what is, in the end, a dull movie with a crap ending. The main character is OK, and his slow descent into near-madness works very well. His brutality towards another survivor (unlike the Walking Dead, these zombies don't eat anything but people), is really out there and one of the more shocking scenes in the movie. His keeping of one trapped zombie as a pet is pretty funny and pathetic, but humans are for the most part, social creatures and crave each others company. I'm not saying that all zombie movies need tons of action, but once he's secured the building and stocked up his supplies - there's little going on. Still better than most of the garbage the SyFy channel, with their pet producers the Asylum foists upon the public, but not worthy of some of the effusive praise heaped upon it.",/review/rw8518907/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2019,jamiekressinger,4," Way to slow.
",Not sure what to say really. It's just a slow and boring zombie film. I've seen reviews about it being a breakthrough in the genre and that it's about a revolving character or a character study.,/review/rw8518907/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2019,careyethomas,," Spoilers but an alternate view of the movie
","So I just watched this movie and wanted to come here for a take on the ending. Then i had an epiphany. The whole ""it is just a dream"" thing may actually apply here. At first I thought it was a straight up zombie movie. But there were disparate pieces when you put them together indicate that it was about his relationship. Often times writers/directors want to make commentaries but wont get the viewers unless there is something that appeals to the masses. Think of District 9 as an example or Starship Troopers. But think back to the beginning of the movie. There is a reason for the whole broken relationship angle. The apartment itself and the elevator are symbols of Sam being trapped within his feelings. He is reluctant to escape and move on. Then think of his constant attempts at ""suicide"" with attracting the zombies. He didnt have to lure them back continually but he did because parts of a person wants to die after a breakup. Remember his rant with Alfred? He was talking about being alone and the actor conveyed that hurt appropriately. Finally, the girl he meets represents opportunity. He shoots her down because he doesnt want anyone else. But in his dream within a dream, he realizes that he does have to move on. He tells her that she is right and has been right all along. He cant stay trapped in the memories of the breakup. He releases the inner him that is trapped in the elevator. Sam could choose to accept his fate once he is trapped in the elevator instead. But he doesnt...he escapes. He does want to live/love again. He is willing to take a leap of faith literally figuratively. At the end he realizes that he has moved on to the next building/relationship. However, they all are the same as he looks out to his future with the same pitfalls. Is he willing to love again and move from building to building? The writer/director leaves that up to the viewer. The road is rough and we dont know if he can or is willing to do it.",/review/rw8518907/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2021,julper-97243,1," Most unlikable protaganist ever
","I tried to like this movie, i did.
But from the get-go, there was a big problem with the ""hero."" Dude has zero personality at best, and is a compete a**hole at the worst.
First off, he sits for hours sulking at an ex-girlfriends party, expecting her to drop everything to give him his lame tapes. Like, COME BACK ANOTHER TIME, GUY. TAKE A HINT.
Plus the idiotic percussion. Again, you'd have to be a total moron to launch into drum solos (while making stupid, stupid faces) during a zombie apocalypse. Everyone knows that zombies come crawling out the woodwork (literally) at the drop of a pin.
And, more importantly, what kind of a protagonist shoots a cat for NO REASON, other than the fact that the cat wanted nothing to do with him. Sam is so unlikable that even a cat prefers zombies to him! They clearly had more personality.
Oh, and speaking of shooting things, he's a shoot-first, ask questions later kind of guy. Probably not the best tactic when you're going mad from loneliness.
I rarely root for the zombies to win, but in this case, I was Team Undead all the way. Do yourself a favor and watch something where the leads are actually likeable. This one...not so much.",/review/rw8518907/?ref_=tt_urv

11 March 2018,searchanddestroy-1,9," Alone in Paris
","Here you have Richard Matheson meeting Georges Romero. Or LAST MAN ON EARTH - OMEGA MAN meeting NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, although both topics are some kind of cousins if you think about it. This little small budget French movie is very tense, innteresting about loneliness and relation matters between human - or non human - persons. You also have poignant moments, such as this scenne where the lead character takes care of a couple of dead people, putting them altogether in their bedroom. You can also think about ROBINSON CRUSOE in this tale about survivance. Nice Paris rooftops views. I loved one of the last scenes whre the lead survivor is among the zombies, in the middle of a thick smoke, impersonating himself a zombie. But something bothers me a bit. The man discovers a long barrel shotgun, and a couple of scenes later he holds a short barrel gun. Is it the same gun or another gun? I think this little problem could have been fixed very easily by the director. Whom I wait for the next picture. One more thing: the director also wrote another French science fiction movie, released a couple of months later in 2018, DANS LA BRUME. Not the same story but the same Paris atmosphere in two very unusual, rare and daring features.",/review/rw8518907/?ref_=tt_urv

",I am totally surprised I did not see this film when it first came out. It was a refreshing take on the zombie-genre.

",Is it better to be alive and alone in a zombie apocalypse or dead and or a zombie? This one does a thorough and solid job of answering all those questions. Zombies and effects are done well but there are long stretches of being stuck with the main character which adds to the sense of claustrophobia.

5 September 2022,olcayozfirat,3," Another animal killed
","2018 French-made zombie-themed horror film. But rather than horror, I think it's drama with suspense sauce. The man is going to get his belongings from his ex. There is a party at home. His ex-girlfriend doesn't care. The man sends him to the study just as he leaves. Our man falls asleep here and wakes up, full of zombies. He struggles to survive, stuck in an apartment alone. Let's get to the downsides. First of all, there is no reason. What happened so everyone became a zombie? The second is too heavy. Due to this weight, the movie causes boring and distraction. Third, what did you want from the cat, man? There are many cliches of zombie movies. Since the man is alone, there is almost no conversation.",/review/rw8518907/?ref_=tt_urv
