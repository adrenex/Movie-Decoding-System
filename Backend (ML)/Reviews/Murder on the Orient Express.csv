31 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,9," Love Bosch!
",I'm so glad that we get to continue the story of Harry Bosch. Bosch is easily one of the most underrated shows ever. I don't know anyone who's seen it that has anything bad to say about it. All you have to do is read through the reviews and ratings to see how loved that show was so it was a no brainer to bring it back for more. They know how much people love this that they renewed it before even one episode aired. Being a huge Bosch fan I had huge expectations going into this and this show not only met those expectations but surpassed them in every way. If Bosch: Legacy ends up half as good as the original Bosch it will still be a great show and so far it's been great! I can't wait to see more!,/review/rw8193920/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," So glad they brought Bosch back!
","Bosch: Legacy is just as good as the original Bosch. Much like the original, it's one of the best, most underrated crime dramas on tv. The writing and acting is what makes this show so special It's hard to find anyone who's ever said anything bad to say about it. Bosch: Legacy continues to follow Harry Bosch, who has now quit his job as a homicide detective and become a personal investigator, as he moved on to the next chapter of his life. His daughter, Maddy, is now a rookie on the police force. Bosch now works with his ex-nemesis, Honey Chandler. Titus Welliver is absolutely perfect as Harry Bosch. If you liked the original Bosch and you haven't seen this yet then what are you waiting for? Go watch this as soon as possible!",/review/rw8193920/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2022,steiner-sam,8," Continues Bosch's high quality
","A sequel to the seven-season ""Bosch"" series, it's a police procedural set in the 2020s in Los Angeles, California, and follows three main characters and a bunch of secondary characters.",/review/rw8193920/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2022,patherwill,10," Fresh as a Daisy!
","Easily one of the best ever Crime series, the characters are so likeable - even dear old Moses, Money Chandlers office ""boy"" and general gopher. I really love the closeness between Harry and Maddie and with her now the Rookie in LAPD, he has even MORE to worry about. I also like the way that several of the actors from the original series have been written into 'Legacy' even if their respective part only adds up to a more or less walk-on or few lines and I hope this family manage to stay together. Titus Welliver, Madison Lintz star. There HAS TO BE another series planned, it can't possibly end like this?",/review/rw8193920/?ref_=tt_urv

",Big Bosch fan. I want atleast 3-4 more series.,/review/rw8193920/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2022,robhall_ie,6," Just not the same
",Script and plotlines just don't match with the first few series. The daughter is still a wooden actresses. Even with these significant flaws we still watch it because the lead is great. Just wish they brought back the original writers.,/review/rw8193920/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2022,payiyugk,10," I don't know
",I don't know why but I like this new series better than the original on Amazon. It seems faster paced a little grittier. I miss J Edgar and the crew but I like the daughter's new role. Hope they keep making more of these. I'm anxious to see where this goes.,/review/rw8193920/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2022,twelve-house-books,10," The Magic Continues Strong
","A police and crime drama enthusiast's wet dream. For fans of classic Noir as well as every other excellent legal drama produced since those heady days (Miami Vice not included). Filled with intrigue, action, wit, humor, and every other emotion, this new series continues the magic the original series gave us. Big fan of films shot in L. A. here--because I was raised in Hollywood. So I know the layout and the kinds of people who make that city tick. Tough, tough-minded, and never backing down.",/review/rw8193920/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2022,mlk18,7," A solid show with awful intro music
","The show is solid with strong familiar characters. It's not the same as the gritty cop drama that was the original Bosch, but it is developing nicel and I have high hopes that it will develop into an 8 or 9. But so far after 3 episodes it's a strong 7. Which is high praise as most of the stuff on TV is barely worthy of a 4 or 5. For me it loses a point because the intro music is horrendous. Like someone should be fired horrendous. They needed to replicate the dark jazzy intro from the original, not use some odd 1980's Miami Vice soundtrack reject. Bosch was one of the only show where I did not click ""skip intro"". I won't make that mistake with Bosch Legacy. Blech.",/review/rw8193920/?ref_=tt_urv

17 May 2022,sciencguy,7," Sloppy writing.
","Disappointing compared to the original series. The writing is somewhat sloppy, with pretty poor justifications for various actions and loose ends all over the place. Bosch and Honey constantly do things that are illegal and unethical, without consequences. Some scenes seem to be written just to bring in characters from the original. Still a good show, but now closer to the level of an ordinary network crime series.",/review/rw8193920/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2022,yaornw,5," Run of the mill PI series, a disappointment
","Look, I LOVE the Books by Connelly and I LOVE the original BOSCH series, so it was surprising and disappointing to me that I just struggled with this. But I did. While Welliver is great as always, the series suffered greatly from the lack of stronger support. There are appearances by some from the old series, and those moments really popped, but the two returning regulars were disappointing. Mimi Rogers is a great actress with years of experience but here I just felt like she went through the motions half the time. The fire wasn't there, and I found her character emotionless and disappointing most of the time because there was no fireworks and dynamics. And Madison Lintz is young and this is her playing a role she originated but her character was mostly wasted. The storyline is at least partially at fault. Lintz always played Maddie a bit low key and steady but it doesn't work here. Here she needs to be stressed and that protective shell cracking as she is faced with the first real challenge of her life since her mother died. She is trying to prove herself worthy of a field where she follows in the shoes of two legends and I just didn't feel that. I also felt sometimes things were too easy for her. And with Lintz playing steady, low key Maddie, the dynamic was also an issue for me. It's too bad, because Lintz showed a lot of promise in the original series, but here the writers don't really seem to know what to do with her-at least not with any confidence. She doesn't have to be the goodie two shoes. She can be more like her father who is the good guy but pushing the boundaries. That would make sense, since her mother also was a tough edge-pusher, so she would have inherited the genes and personality. But instead we get someone who is too calm and steady most of the time. We need more dynamics, and they just weren't there. Even with the weaker writing (from a team whose writing is generally top notch, I might add), if the character was written and played more like a young adult finally free to figure out who she is in the world and who she wants to be with the emotions and struggles of that, it would work a lot better. It's just too low key. Everything about the original was edgy and pushed boundaries and the realism only added to the grit. But Legacy is not living up to that so far, at least in Season 1, and I find myself for the first time not rushing to binge episodes all at once as soon as they're available, and instead waiting until I get a moment to watch. LINCOLN LAWYER I raced through in a day or two. The original series I almost always watched 10 episodes in one night. And then watched it over and over again. This time, I'm not feeling that. And it's too bad. Because the writing and producing team can do better. Let's hope they do for the future, because Bosch and Maddie have so much more life in them. Honey Chandler feels more played out to me. But we'll see. I'd love to come back and revise this later to a much higher rating and positive review, but I am currently definitely disappointed.",/review/rw8193920/?ref_=tt_urv

","Delivers in every way and if you're a Bosch fan, it is unmissable ... I love that it picks up from where it left off and they haven't tried a completely weird spinoff . Titus Welliver will forever be known as Harry Bosch for delivering this character so convincingly and in such entirety. More please and much much more ...",/review/rw8193920/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2022,patrickharding-63013,5," Maddy kills it again
",I loved the original series. I could take the daughter in the early seasons but then they expanded her role. Problem is that as the actor grew up her acting grew worse and worse. She is by far the most pathetic actor to play a cop in a long time. I stopped after episode four just excuses I couldn't take her wooden expressionless acting any more.,/review/rw8193920/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2022,stickman007,2," Once good. Now contrived fantasy.
","The original BOSCH series was a fairly realistic police procedural combined with a ""whodunit"" aspect that was generally pretty solid adult entertainment. Unfortunately this continuation (LEGACY) with many of the same characters resembles one of those ridiculous older TV series like MAGNUM PI. In fact, MAGNUM PI was probably more realistic.",/review/rw8193920/?ref_=tt_urv

","Old one I loved, new one is so boring that my wife can't even stay awake. And Maddy is not even remotely convincing as a cop. I can't understand how this is rated so high.

13 May 2022,nijell,6," As good as the original series but what a shame.....
","I must be the only one that finds Madison Lintz acting irritating!? I could put up with her in Bosch because she had a minor role but, oh dear, she's unfortunately got a bigger part in this new Legacy edition. Wooden is one way to describe her inability to act from her 'perpetual singular look' to her unconvincing character portrayals. It is such a shame the Director cannot see this too! If you fast forward past her bits you'll enjoy this much more, in fact it won't really change the story line either!",/review/rw8193920/?ref_=tt_urv
