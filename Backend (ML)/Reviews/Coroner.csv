18 November 2022,naregian,8," A completely bonkers and over-the-top, yet perhaps brilliant satire
","This is a movie that plays on something everyone has come across in their lives: obsession. The movie starts out as a seemingly eerie thriller/suspense type movie with weird and unique quirks, but slowly devolves into something much more wild and very obviously takes it too far. With a script tighter than the meticulously crafted Chef's menu, even the most curmudgeon movie-goer will have their plates full with this one.",/review/rw8802033/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2022,Paragon240,5," The Menu began with a tone and tension that made me want more but ultimately ended with confusion and disappointment.
","The hype for The Menu intrigued me. The reviews celebrated its genius. So I had to see it. And when I sat in the theater and the credits began to roll, all o could say was, ""Huh?"" The Menu starts with Ready or Not vibes with a fish-out-of-water real-world character who ends up at a fancy dinner with a collection of high society foodies and critics. The trailer gave me expectations of cannibalism cult or Most Dangerous Game-type plots, but instead, nothing really happened. I think I understood what The Menu was trying to convey with its deeper meaning, but I still came up disappointed. Anya Taylor-Joy and the rest of the cast gave great performances, but there was little that really brought the movie together. Maybe the subversion of the cannibal or hunting expectation was the movie's brilliance? The Menu definitely tried to be clever, but whether it was or not might be open to interpretation. Ironically, I sat through the whole movie and left wanting more... left hungry.",/review/rw8802033/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2022,nscoby93,8," One of the most unique theater going experiences I've had in a long time
","This film was something else, I am genuinely stumped and at a loss for words. Mark Mylod (Director) Seth Reiss (Writer) and Will Tracey (Writer) all deserve a round of applause. They all together created something so unique.",/review/rw8802033/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,redbeardceltic,10," A dark comedy satire reflecting the nation today
","From the start and the trailer, I think many will realize this is not a typical film. It means that you cannot watch it as a story narrative but understand it is a representation, a satire. And what is that satire?",/review/rw8802033/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2022,evanston_dad,6," Nice Try, But the Satire Doesn't Land

24 November 2022,julieshotmail,6," I tried to chew but couldn't swallow
","""The Menu"" offers a trailer spectacular enough to entice me to set foot in a physical movie theater for the first time in 3 years. Packed with both veteran and burgeoning actors and directed by Mark Mylod of ""Succession"" fame, this movie has all the goodies to entertain you and make you think at the same time, supposedly. It starts out well enough, introducing quirky mysterious characters starting with Elsa played by Hong Chau. I find her really captivating in this role, a perfect combo of politeness and menace. Why is she dressed like that? Then we meet the Chef who has an agenda that unravels through the perspective of Margot, played by the always-awesome Anya Taylor-Joy. Margot is us, wanting to expose the ridiculousness of it all. Yet herein lies the problem with the movie. Its effort as a biting satire turns into a confusing mess at the end. ""The Menu"" could have given us something to chew on, instead I walk out of the movie theater scratching my head.",/review/rw8802033/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2022,Her-Excellency,6," Original, but ultimately unsatisfying fare.
","I waited months for this film thinking it would be so much better than it was. There is nothing quite like the let down of expecting something great, and it turning out to be mediocre at best.",/review/rw8802033/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2022,Mike_Noga,4," 86 it!
",This looked like an interesting film based on the trailer and the first half of it was just that. The tension and suspense was building nicely. There were little dribs and drabs and hints of what might be coming without being too obvious. The acting from everyone in the film was good. Even supporting characters with only a few lines. Were well realized I remember thinking that I couldn't wait to see where it was all going.,/review/rw8802033/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2022,masonsaul,8," Great satire
","The Menu isn't the first to satirise the rich and their incompetence and isn't saying anything new but that definitely doesn't prevent it from being a great satire that pokes fun at everything it can in ways that are often consistently funny, playful and extremely stylish.",/review/rw8802033/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2022,ethanbresnett,8," A very tasty treat indeed!

4 January 2023,wisemanfromtowne,2," One dumb film.
","If you are an avid film watcher and want your intelligence insulted by a story depicting a bunch decent actors playing very inept roles as guest to dine at a remote island restaurant hosted by a sadistic chef to then be massacre without fighting back at all, then have at it. I mean this was absolutely appalling to watch. You really want me to believe that I'm trapped on a island defenseless against a bunch of cooks? That there is no way to defend myself is anyway with a bunch of utensils all around? Seriously? That I'm so supposed to just accept my fate at the hand of dimwits based off a nonsensical menu to only become part of the menu? Really? And that's the story premise I kid you not. No matter many hype reviews have been posted, This was just one dumb film.",/review/rw8802033/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2023,paulclaassen,3," Serve me something else, please.
","'The Menu' received widespread acclaim, and honestly I can't fathom why. The film is just as pretentious as gourmet cooking.",/review/rw8802033/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2022,zkonedog,3," Absence Of A Single Likable Character (Or Over-Arching Message) May Limit The Palette Here
","Mark Mylod's ""The Menu"" is clearly a satire of a great many things--class, snobbishness, obsession, and the eating experience-in-general immediately spring to mind. While it certainly gets some awkward laughs and throws enough bizarre sight/character gags to live up to that satire moniker, it does so without one coherent, over-arcing message or a single character to really root for.",/review/rw8802033/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2022,RahulM007,9," A sumptuous feast for the eyes
","Mark Mylod's ""The Menu"" is a tasteful treat that manages to be gripping, satirical, jarring, and hauntingly brilliant. The film is a great social commentary on class values and class systems. It gives audiences an adrenaline rush that makes for an exciting and wild viewing experience. The film is filled with twists and turns and keeps the viewer guessing till the credits roll. Apart from its rich screenplay and magnificent production design, the film also benefits from having a star-studded cast. Ralph Fiennes as the stern and conservative Chef Slovik is the obvious standout, but Anya Taylor-Joy as Margot aka Erin brings something different to the table (literally). Nicholas Hoult as Tyler perfectly brings this rather douchey and self-obsessed character to life. I went in completely blind, not having watched the trailer and avoided any marketing for the movie, and I'm glad that I did. Everyone should experience this movie by themselves and to not let anyone influence their opinion. I wouldn't be surprised if the movie nabs Oscar nominations for best production design and best screenplay. Mark Mylod fully utilized his creative outlet and managed to craft something peculiar, unfamiliar, and delightful.",/review/rw8802033/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2022,vengeance20,4," I'd Like To Take It Back
","So, having only seen a brief preview of this & reading briefly what this was about I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. It was a horror/comedy type film so that is the reason why I went in to see this.",/review/rw8802033/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,The_Swedish_Reviewer,1," Pointless and empty
","Dark humor and satire are mostly very satisfying. But in The Menu it didn't go as well as it started. The beginning is actually very good. I was completely enchanted. The cinematography and acting is stunning. But somewhere in the middle something went very wrong. So wrong that you don't understand what's going on. And that's exactly where The Menu fails. Too many awkward and crazy things happen and no one seemed to care, and that's also when I realized that The Menu is actually a very pointless and empty dark satire with no real punchline. Only snobbish film critics will love this ""masterpiece"". Real people who prefer a cheeseburger to snobbish food will hate it. Giving it one star to offset the high rating the film doesn't deserve.",/review/rw8802033/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2022,iainmcleod_800,2," Just awful

17 November 2022,AfricanBro,," Rice or Risotto?
","Eloquent and beautifully made but not for me, hence no rating. I understand the couple reviews with high ratings, I see where they're coming from but I won't be coming from there. You know when someone tells you a story and it's a nothing story, nothing good nothing bad; like when someone tells you ""hey, I went for a walk at the park"" and you're just like 'oh okay'. I left the cinema and all I felt was ""oh, okay"".",/review/rw8802033/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2023,michael-561-692892,3," Artsy and empty

3 December 2022,gunn-wrights,3," I just don't get it - I guess?

18 November 2022,EvanparkerT,9," After watching this I crave a cheeseburger!
","The Menu is probably the most unpredictable movie I've seen in a while. This thriller is filled tension and super dark comedy moments and it's wonderfully carried by the amazing, Anya-Taylor Joy, the charismatic, Nicholas Hoult, the menacing, Ralph Fiennes, and the rest of the cast as well (one of the best ensembles in a film of the year). Overall, this is a brilliant satire on the food industry and class warfare. This film is (pun intended) chef's kiss!",/review/rw8802033/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,transoptical,1," 6' Deep Plot Holes
","Felt like the script was banged out over a weekend with plot holes big enough to drive a freight train through. Zero character development; the players were flatter than a tortilla with a printed picture. The further along we went, the more kludged the story line; I ran out of disbelief to suspend. People simply don't do the things the characters pretended to do. The drowning angel segment was like a wart on the production. This was a circus of emotional manipulation. I guess the moral of the story was - the ho' is proletariat, the ho' gets to live.",/review/rw8802033/?ref_=tt_urv
