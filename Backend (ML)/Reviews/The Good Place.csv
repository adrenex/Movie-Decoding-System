11 October 2022,mf2812,7," Misunderstood & Mislabelled
","Just finished watching and was pleasantly surprised. I didn't think that Mr Harrington's Phone would be a good enough storyline to be brought to the big-screen but, evidently, it has. The people moaning about it not being scary are way off. The short novella was really good but it was more of a drama like the movie. The movie does differ on some aspects of the source material and I don't know why it did as it worked perfectly fine in the writing. All I'll say is, don't expect horror. You'll not at one single point be scared, but the book never tried to be. It's just down simply as horror as that description goes down well with movie descriptions and Stephen King.",/review/rw8604425/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2022,kcitraro,9," I related so much I waited a day to write this
","Ok, so as you can see, I can very much relate to this movie. So much so that I waited to write this review. Some of the criticism I'm seeing was that it wasn't enough of a ""Stephen King"" that it was more of a coming of age movie. Do these same people know that he wrote ""The green mile"" also. Not everything he does is a horror flick. I wanted to give this a 10 but took into account how others received this movie since, for me, it hit so close to home.",/review/rw8604425/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,gabriel_sanchez,7," Psych drama about the beginning of smartphones with a touch of horror
","I found Mr. Harrigan's Phone unique. Modern psychological drama; tech horror, I guess. At first, you are guided through very slow-paced storytelling about Craig and his relationship with Mr. Harrigan. This part of the plot is character development. After a turning point near the last third of the story, the horror sets in.",/review/rw8604425/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,LincolnSixEko,5," Weird mishmash of genres
","Starts out a a good drama/thriller type movie then continued on for about half of it. Got to know the characters, sets things up pretty well, all is good so far. Then the thriller part ramps up some and it gets more and more exciting. Up until that point I thought it was pretty good.",/review/rw8604425/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,BijeshNagesh,7," Slow But Suspenseful
","It was surprisingly simple what they did with this novella adaptation, and Stephen King's at that. The 'King of Horror' penned an anthology titled ""If It Bleeds"" (published, 2020), and ""Mr. Harrigan's Phone"" was one of its offerings.",/review/rw8604425/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2022,imdb-14850,8," Ignore impatience. Watch intelligently.
","We live in an 'instant age.' We're used to getting what we want immediately. So, anyone giving this film a bad review probably didn't understand the need to focus and apply patience to a story that unfolds gradually. It is impeccably written. All the story setups and essential bases are cleverly covered. It is brilliantly made with authentic characters supported with superb acting. It moves at comfortable pace with no dull moment or drawn-out, unnecessary scene. An all-round excellent film. Give it a chance and be receptive to rare, excellent storytelling. It could be one of the the best films you've seen in a long time.",/review/rw8604425/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2022,JabezGill,4," Not bad, not Great, not really worth the time - spoilers marked at the end of review so it's safe to read
","This movie had an extremely interesting concept - unfortunately... after establishing the concept they fail to explore it at all. It is well made, acting is good, however the story feels empty and like it goes nowhere. When it finally felt like ""okay this is where the real fun starts and where things will go off the rails..."" the credits roll and it is over.",/review/rw8604425/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2022,GreyHunter,6," A pretty decent drama and a somewhat disappointing horror
","First things first -- like many people, I binge horror in October, generally one movie a day from the 1st through the 30th, then, time allowing, two or three on Halloween itself. This movie was my choice for today (I've seen so many horrors that I have to look off the beaten path for new ones sometimes, and sometimes I just get lazy and re-watch an old favorite) So my disappointment stems largely from the fact that I was hoping for an actual horror to fill my daily horror movie.)",/review/rw8604425/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2022,hellostranger-32317,10," Great Film, Don't Expect Horror
","The movie is about a young boy who is hired to read books to an old man who's eyes aren't what they used to be. They end up teaching each other many unique things and form a great friendship before he passes of heart disease and the boy is left to deal with not only the grief of his friend, but that of his mother. Then he starts receiving messages from the dead man's phone.",/review/rw8604425/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2022,atlastu2,6," A Stephen King story without the horror
","When I saw the trailer for this film, I was kind of excited since it's based on a story for Stephen King, and the premise was interesting, plus the two main lead actors (Donald Sutherland, Jaeden Martell) are definitely great.",/review/rw8604425/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,ollie501,9," A Tale of Two Characters.
","Firstly, despatch from your mind any notion that this is a horror film. It isn't. It's even questionable whether it's supernatural. What it is, however, is an excellent study of death and the perception of grief by a young man. Jaeden Martell excels as Craig, around whom the story is centred. His friendship with an almost Dickensian elderly man approaching the end of his life (Donald Sutherland) is strangely beautiful, and at the end of Harrigan""s life is made all the more poignant as Craig reads from A Tale if Two Cities to the deceased man. Throughout the story, the addiction to smartphones, and the constant stream of information we are fed, is prevalent, and it is through the phone which Craig believes Harrigan speaks to him and influences the lives and deaths of others around him. It is left to the viewer to draw their own conclusions as to whether this is supernatural, and there are interesting clues to pick over, but ultimately this is a fascinating tale of grief, loneliness and friendship. Martell and Sutherland work together beautifully, and create two characters to whom it is easy to feel affection for and affinity with. 9/10.",/review/rw8604425/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2022,npnjkmgsv,9," Brilliant, thoughtful film

6 October 2022,dlmiley,7," Worth a look for the excellent performances
","I watched ""Mr. Harrigan's Phone"" on Netflix last night. It is based on the short story of the same name by Stephen King. It is about a young man (Jaeden Martell) recruited by a billionaire (Donald Sutherland) to read to the old man since the man's eyesight is failing. Of course, since this is a Stephen King novel, there is a mystery involved with a hint of horror. But the main part of the story is the development of respect and friendship between the old man and the young man. It is very well acted by the two leads and is definitely worth a look. Some horror fans were disappointed by the lack of gore, but to me that is not the point of the story. Check it out for yourself and see if you agree. 7/10.",/review/rw8604425/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,kattrambo,7," It's Not Scary, but great acting and will make you think
","Such good acting. It is slow, but you become invested in the characters early enough to stay interested. Donald Sutherland did AMAZING. Every time he was on the screen you wanted to watch him. It's been a while since he was so captivating on screen. It is deep and has an underlying message which may irritate people, but I agree with that message so I related to the movie well. Cell phones/Smart phones aren't always the best use of our time, or the healthiest option for our own minds. They have become addictive and overused in our society to the point that people can no longer think objectively. I don't like that the mom was never really explained.",/review/rw8604425/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,zkonedog,6," Lacking The Emotion Of The Original Story, But At Least An Okay Adaptation
","I consider ""Mr. Harrigan's Phone"" to be perhaps the most masterful short story ever penned by Stephen King. While this adaptation of King's work is far from the best (Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile), it is certainly light years ahead of the worst (2022 Firestarter, Cell).",/review/rw8604425/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,h2223,4," Lacks a clear raison d'Ãªtre
","It's watchable... but you wonder why you're watching it. I suppose it's because Donald Sutherland and Jaeden Martell do a great job of acting. The problem is, they're acting out a confused script. What does this movie want to be? What's it *actually* about? Calling it a ""horror"" film is laughable. There's nothing even particularly chilling about it, much less ""horrifying."" There isn't even much drama or intrigue.",/review/rw8604425/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,bgaiv,6," So much nice setup with no payoff

15 October 2022,gromero-50999,8," Nice Saturday Morning Movie
","I thought this film was well acted and well paced. It's not a horror film, and people should realize Stephen King doesn't only write horror. They should also realize he typically throws in a bit of unexplained phenomena that keeps you guessing and or questioning reality. Think the Green Mile. To me it was a nice story of a boy's sadness, hopes and regrets, and his growth as a person. Except for the unexplained, I would say the situations and the way people interacted with each other felt real. Even the bully wasn't over the top. The final conflict did seem rushed, and not as impactful. Overall it was an enjoyable film to watch on a Saturday morning while I drank my coffee.",/review/rw8604425/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,perisho,6," NOT A HORROR MOVIE - but a fine movie
","This is not a horror movie despite being written by King. Think more Stand by Me than IT. Quasi-supernatural goings on in a New England town, just like all his stuff. Serviceable entertainment as usual, but not horror and not groundbreaking.",/review/rw8604425/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2022,A_Different_Drummer,8," a matter of some considerable irony..
","There is an inside joke in Hollywood that no one has ever successfully translated a King novel to the big screen, not even King himself. Like most inside jokes, to get it, you first have to revisit all the many attempts over the years to give life to his prose, and see where most if not all failed. So it is a matter of some irony, at least for this reviewer, that, at this late date, creator John Lee Hancock (who both wrote the screenplay for, and directed this one) should succeed where others have failed. There is a purity, a simplicity and a singleness of purpose to this adaptation that all the others lacked. And that is the key to why this works. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

5 October 2022,apryla-58795,9," Unsatisfying unresolved ending but DS still has it
","I was not familiar with the Stephen King book this movie is based on so I don't know if it's any good but this movie adaptation sure is. Craig (played adequately by Jaeden Martell) is a young boy who does readings in his small town church. One day Mr. Harrigan (played by the amazing Donald Sutherland-he gives an award worthy performance making the most of his short screen time) attends church and hears Craig reading. Soon after Mr. Harrigan asks Craig's dad if he can pay Craig to come to his mansion three times a week and read to him due to his failing eyesight. Thus starts an evolving 5 year relationship between the two. Craig's mother passed away when he was young and he has been emotionally unmoored ever since. He's quiet, smart and not one of the cool kids and thus a target for the school bully.",/review/rw8604425/?ref_=tt_urv

5 October 2022,baunacholi-86159,8," Be careful what u wish for
","Only a few weeks ago I read the short story by Stephen King and thought, wow that's an amazing story! So relevant, so now...Hopefully it will hit the screen and will be translated with exactly the vibe the novel captured. Well, what can I say, it did. Maybe because of Mr. Kings function as executive producer... in any case, it's the story itself which makes this movie special. How it's told. How it evolves in small and accurate steps. There're no jump scares, CGI effect overload nor cheap thrills - mystery for sure, plenty to be precise, but this in absolutely the right amount and with consideration.",/review/rw8604425/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2022,weiss4307,8," Just kind of ended
","The film started off great. Good story, acting and cinematography. I feel like I could have enjoyed a whole extra hour of this film if they would have wrapped it up more successfully. The ending was disappointing. They did a great job building the story and making you empathize with the characters, so much so, I feel this is why I felt so disappointed with the ending. When you have a name like Stephen King attached to it, I think it raises your expectations. Overall, it was a good film. I just wish they would have done more with the story and the ending. It felt like they used all their time with the build up.",/review/rw8604425/?ref_=tt_urv
