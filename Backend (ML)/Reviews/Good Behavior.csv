9 March 2021,j0hnayres,10," None of these reviews are about the real Whole Bloody Affair edit
",Most of these people are reviewing fan edits of the movie. The movie has never been released and has never leaked. If anyone actually saw it they happened to see it for the brief time it was in the theater.,/review/rw7192063/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2020,spinoff75,8," You probably watched a FAN EDIT
","Yeah! DON'T believe this is the Director's Cut, is not! Is a merely the work of a proactive fan who put the two movies together. ""The Whole Bloody Affair"" never ever has been released either in DVD, Blu-Ray or Digital Copy. The only time that Kill Bill Vol.1 and Vol.2 was showed like this to an audience, in a theatre was in the premiere in Cannes.",/review/rw7192063/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2018,kritikoumariaq,10," Tarantino's Masterpiece
","His best film so far. What i didn't like was that he made some changes in Vol.1 but that wasn't really necessary! He should make changes in Vol.2 because i found some scenes completely pointless. And also i prefer the two parts separate because they are so different each other! I liked Vol.1 much more than Vol.2. Yes, it's a bit confusing. However, it is more like a complete movie, so some people won't complain. But i still think they are better as two seperate films with different philosophy and style.",/review/rw7192063/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2020,moviehorror,10," 4 hours of greatness
",This the only way to watch this movie everything flows so smoothly. The sure power of this version blows you away. If you can a find a way to watch it you'll have the best 4 hours of your life,/review/rw7192063/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2017,kritikoumaria,10," All Time Epic Masterpiece!
","This is the best Kill Bill version. Actually, it is a huge masterpiece.I have seen many movies, but this is the best of all. Kung Fu, ninja, samurai style,it reminds western. A heart-broken woman fighting for revenge and because of her lost child.The first feminist movie created by Q&U.The cast was brilliant. Quentin's directing changes was awesome. Soundtracks in perfect harmony.It is definitely a memorable movie with so much thrill and action.The best movie i have ever seen.All the cast was brilliant, i liked the martial arts style, Gordon Liu as Pai Mei and the plot. Tarantino is a very genius man and he knows how to make movies.",/review/rw7192063/?ref_=tt_urv

",Kill Bill movies were very good. It was very enjoyable to watch them together.,/review/rw7192063/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2021,napchier,10," I've only ever seen a fanedit...
","...which doesn't really count. Never understood why this edit wasn't made available. Don't think it ever screened in the UK. It gets a 10, as based on my review of both movies, squished together in a single sitting. It still holds up. A tremendous movie - since both became available I've only ever watched it as a single movie. Interestingly enough both movies clock in at about 4 hours. This one however is about 3.5 hours. I know it contains extra scenes, extended scenes, different angles, etc, but evidently has a few things cut away from it, indicating it's a very different very different version indeed.",/review/rw7192063/?ref_=tt_urv

The best version of kill Bill",/review/rw7192063/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2020,masoncheek,10," Kill Bill is a masterpiece.
","This is a 10/10 film, I loved every second of it. Watch it, now.",/review/rw7192063/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2021,amindostiari,10," Revenge
","It was a great movie. The story was quite fascinating and causal. In the two screens, I prefer Vol 2. The characters were very interesting, especially the bride. From this film comes revenge, blood, anger and finally love.",/review/rw7192063/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2019,redhawk-44571,10," The Greatest Revenge Film Ever
","Kill Bill is a martial arts epic with great dialogue, a cornucopia of references, and that signature Tarantino flair for violence and a deep passionate love for cinema as a medium. This film, to me, acts as the perfect fusion of samurai movies, spaghetti westerns, and Hollywood spectacle. The Showdown at The House of Blue Leaves, where The Bride must face-off against O-Ren Ishii and the Crazy 88, is a masterclass in how to create an action scene, and the rest of the action in the movie has a level of quality only slightly below that.
Do yourself a favor; if you truly love movies, go see Kill Bill, because you will almost certainly love it too.",/review/rw7192063/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2021,numenorsniper-66396,10," Tarantino's best by a wide margin

","Just let yourself be entertained. Imagination, creativity, homage, recycling, all together to give us an immense enjoyment. With or without references, it is an appreciable work. Warning: It can cause an irresistible urge to purchase katanas, retro trainers, classic cars, take kung fu classes, take Japanese classes, watch anime, give a scratch to a pimp, sell the trailer and hug your kids to the sound of a Morriconian sundown.",/review/rw7192063/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,ingobert,8," Relationship drama between professional killers
","Relationship drama between professional killers, that might be a suitable subtitle. So she finds out during an assignment that she's pregnant, doesn't want to be a killer anymore, and decides to leave Bill, marry someone else and start a new life. And all without consulting Bill. Hmm. Bill isn't a choleric after all, he gives the impression that you can talk to him rationally. And obviously he doesn't hate being a father that much. Who knows, maybe he wouldn't have wanted to be a killer anymore if she'd talked to him. Anyway, SHE was the stumbling block, not him.",/review/rw7192063/?ref_=tt_urv

3 August 2021,alizashadab,10," too excited and scared to actually watch it
","I thought of the original kill bill movies as the stuff of legends a work of cinema for the ages but now they are saying this is better so i am scared as this is a historical monumental moment i have to plan it
also let's maintain the rating till it reaches 10k votes so it in the top 250. And let's make sure the locals don't find it and vote it down sorry punctuation freaks.",/review/rw7192063/?ref_=tt_urv
