24 March 2018,LiquidPoetry1921,1," Chicago Fire Wannabee Fails Miserably
","Perhaps because 'Scandal' is coming to an end, and 'Grey's Anatomy' is in its 56th+ season, Shondra Rimes is looking for a new venture to undertake. If she's trying to turn Seattle into what Dick Wolf did with Chicago, 'Station 19' is a COLOSSAL fail.",/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2022,kristal-42201,1," Goes down the drain REAL fast... Too much drama
",First 2 episodes I had to get into it as it all was about this main character Andy shouting and putting her mark on everything and bossing everyone around.,/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2022,cmbills-51612,2," Narcistic spoiled brats!
","The first and second seasons weren't bad. Everything after that is pathetic. First responders? No. Of course this is a fictional TV show but, come on, some realism would be good. In a building fighting a fire but taking long breaks to stop and talk about their relationships? No. The series progresses into 85% trash and soap opera, 15% decent show. The characters are all narcists and act like spoiled brats. It's a waste of time.",/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv

","20 minutes into the first episode. Cringing! What a drama, and I don't mean that in a positive way!",/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2018,bsloughrin,1," Wow?
",Did Shondaland get sold? This is so far below past experiences. Some of the weakest writing seen in years. This will take television back 50 years.,/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2022,anaplus-73569,4," Getting worse with every episode!
","I thought 911 Lone Star was lame but this show takes the cake. No script or story line, it's either fighting fires or hooking up at the station. Season 1 and 2 was super annoying with the background commentary, music and dialogue all together. The commentary finally stopped in season 3 but the story just went all over the place, with character backstories and so much drama! Oh and season 4 is so over the top. Not sure how this show is getting renewed, its quite bad.",/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2022,bob-392-417066,1," Daytime Soap
","If you're in the UK then Station 19 is Eastenders or Coronation Street set in a fire station......except both those soaps are infinitely better than this politically correct, ""Shonda let's make another gay, lesbian or trans point"", woke drivel! Terrible stories, stereotypical characters acting very poorly, what's to like?",/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2021,c_sims76,1," Was good
",Station 19 was such a good show. It was a well-balanced mix of first responder drama mixed with personal drama. At the start of season four it became 80% personal drama mixed in with political BS. Trying to be super politically correct and woke. It's more BS than the daytime soaps. Hate to have to stop watching something that was different and well written at the start.,/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2018,sonicvoodoo,1," Are you kidding me?
","I NEVER write reviews. I like sappy melodramas. I don't expect much from network TV and settle for most anything when I'm bored. All this being said, this series is just plain awful/terrible. I find it absolutely incredible that ANYONE would invest time and money and then decide to air this junk. It really baffles me.",/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2018,jackbenton2,7," Pathetic
","Chicago Fire has nothing to worry about with this trash. Unreal. As a Firefighter, I'm Truly embarrassed.",/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2018,nancy-793-228879,1," Bored with it already
",So slow! No likeable characters. Warren has gone from being a plausible doctor to an idiot! Put the fire out and leave it alone! Uh so disappointed!,/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2021,andresmitit,1," Not entertaining anymore
","Used to be ok, but latest season is far too political with not so subtle storylines. Off my watchlist.",/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2021,bschaaf-84076,1," Demonstrates the WORST FD tactics
","It's like they not only never consulted even one experienced firefighter before writing the super cringy fire scenes, but it seems like they purposely refused to consult anyone and use writers that have never even seen a single firefighter in their entire lives. It's literally the worst tactics, worst decisions possible, and most unsafe behaviors demonstrated on every single episode with so much drama added to it.",/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2021,celticwarrior_amazonwoma,1," This might as well be a Hallmark movie
","Seriously. Watch any soap opera or Hallmark movie. They just needed a fresh setting to stage a bunch of relationship drama. And just like a Hallmark movie , they have a bunch of equipment and props laying around that get polished maybe once an episode. The rest of the episodes are all characters in their love triangles or disputes. No surprise this is attached to Grey's Anatomy. Same garbage.",/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2021,cockezville,1," Horrible Show
","I am a card carrying left of center guy, but this show is so disgusting full of pc platitudes and lousy characterization. This is not ChicagoMed or anything close. Too much police bashing and obvious calculated ultra left scripting.makes this show unwatchable. Cancel this mess",/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2018,kejjr-27080,1," Nothing here
","Anther whiny Grey's Anatomy, even more unauthentic than Grey's. No threat the Chicago series. And what with the cornball music/songs? I guess it's a chick thing, but this chick doesn't like it. It does make 9-1-1 look good.",/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2018,GrammarMatters,1," Wow! This is awful!
","I'm half an hour into this - and I'm done. Goodbye. It's so cheesy with pathetic writing that is obviously created by an untalented hack. I've found myself rolling my eyes several times already, and I can't waste my time with this absolute garbage after re-watching the end of last seasons Billions episode in preparation for the new season starting in a few days. Billions reminds me how incredibly awesome TV can sometimes be. This dreck is the absolute opposite. The only reason to watch this stupidity is to laugh at the morons who wrote and created it. As the son of a firefighter, and someone with several years of university medical knowledge - it's actually PAINFUL to subject myself to imbecilic writing that this junk subjects me to.

31 March 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,2," Drama, drama, drama with zero substance
","Nevermind the factual issues that would never happen in a real FD, but what's worse is the lame soap-opera drama overshadowing and real story that may be interesting. We've had enough of Grey's Anatomy, we didn't need another one - with lamer acting. 2/10",/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2021,murphalicious-73271,1," Getting political
",I got into this about a year or two ago because of all the Grey's crossovers. I was actually really starting to enjoy it and get invested in the characters and then this season it's all politics all the time. So tired of this BS. I keep giving them both just one more episode. And then the latest one just ended with George Floyd on the news. I'm done with both.,/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2018,kejjr-27080,1," Thought it would get better
","It hasn't. There is nothing realistic about this show, and too corny to be amusing.",/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2021,mel_bernard,3," Meh! More lousy drama than rescue
",I decided to watch this after watching 911 on Fox and had high hopes but to be honest this is just another Grey's Anatomy with different characters who keep on bickering with each other. More lousy drama than rescue. Ugh cant stop rolling my eyes!!!!!,/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2018,YouMakeMe,1," Stupid

3 June 2021,Rob123456,1," Too political now. Done with it.
",Was an interesting show when it first started but now it is not entertainment but is a pedestal for a political agenda. We get enough of that from CNN. I want to escape reality when I watch a fictional TV show not be preached to.,/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2018,DreamyOneNumber1,1," WORST PROGRAM EVER- and I mean in the history of television
","I love the police dramas, the legal dramas, the medical shows, the shows about the fire departments and first responders.... I was looking forward to this. Sadly, it was difficult to get through even five minutes of it. But I was hopeful that it might get better so I decided to watch it to its conclusion. ",/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2018,itsmetif,10," Love it
","Breaking news - this is not a documentary. For anyone looking for a highly realistic show about firefighters or paramedics, police or doctors, this is not the show for you. This is a show designed to entertain not inform. It is a spin off from Grey's Anatomy so you're looking at the same level of melodrama that has kept that show on air for 13 years.",/review/rw4187011/?ref_=tt_urv
