15 November 2020,ThomDerd,6," Not boring-Not great
","A film about an extinction level asteroid event which lead the protagonists and the rest of the humans to search for shelter and the chaos that comes with it.
Film is running with a good pace overall and will keep you on edge. But the script is average, the chaos created is something that you have seen in so many similar movies and the idea is far from novel. Also some of the scenes in there just dot make sense or they feel a bit stupid. Luckily most of the acting is ok, the score and the visuals are ok so it constitutes an ok movie to watch-but don't expect to be blown away with this film. 6/10",/review/rw7039429/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2021,masonsaul,8," Great disaster movie
","It's plot is nothing new but Greenland is still a great disaster movie that benefits from it's human and grounded approach resulting in an extremely tense and emotional film. Gerard Butler, Morena Baccarin and Roger Dale Floyd are all great and Scott Glenn is really good. Ric Roman Waugh's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed and well paced. The CG is good and not overused and the music by David Buckley is really good.",/review/rw7039429/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2020,Gordon-11,," Couldn't empathise with the family
","Though this story is intense, I feel very annoyed by a series of poor decisions by the lead couple. I couldn't empathise with the family, and hence couldn't get into the story.",/review/rw7039429/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2021,fmbr-1,6," Not bad, but certainly not great.
","A lot of these reviews talk strangely about a lack of cliches in this film but there are plenty. The sick kid, the family separated and then desperately trying to get find each other again, the count down to the end of the world, all of these are there.",/review/rw7039429/?ref_=tt_urv

","Watched ""Greenland"". Doesn't add anything new to the catastrophic events genre, yet it was the perfect movie to watch amid the coronavirus pandemic. Sitting in a sparsely populated movie theater, wearing my facemask, I was thinking ""it could be so much worse!""",/review/rw7039429/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2020,Draysan-Jennings,8," Edge of your seat thrill ride
",Nevermind the bad reviews! This movie is awesome. I swear people are so hard to please these days. This film definitely had my heart racing. It got extremely intense there several times. This has to be one of my favorite disaster flicks. Deep Impact eat your heart out. I highly recommend giving this movie a watch. 8 stars üëçüëç,/review/rw7039429/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2020,ijameson,7," Better than expected.
","A decent end of the world movie that deals with what would happen on the ground.
Follows one family, and their interactions with other desperate people.
Reasonable acting, and nice special effects.",/review/rw7039429/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2020,zachtellefsen,3," Can't a disaster movie be about the disaster?
","All the cool stuff is in the trailer. Everything is ""oh no! But we've been selected to be saved! Yay! Oh no! We forgot little Nathan's insulin! I'll go get it! Oh no!

13 November 2020,syldt1,3," Leave your brain at the door, please...
","Another crappy movie where millions of people die but, hey! It doesn't matter because the three unlikable main characters got saved, after sorting out stupid situation after stupid stuation and endangering everyone else with their selfish behaviour!. And right, yeah, governments spend public money building bunkers to save engineers and their families in case a meteorite strikes Earth, and also, good Samaritans carry people on their airplanes from Canada to Greenland for free, and at first you can only get to the bunkers strictly if you are elected by said government, and people will kill you for your ticket, but then it doesn't matter anymore and you can just knock on their doors and soldiers will send a truck to pick your sorry ass...and the list of ludicrous stuff goes on and on...It makes ""2012"" look like awards material...",/review/rw7039429/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2020,deloudelouvain,8," My kind of movie. Human extinction is just entertaining to watch.
","Like always with movies about an apocalyptic future you will have positive and negative reviews. The negative reviews from people that are going to cry about the inaccurate things in the plot and positive reviews from people that enjoy this genre without being too picky. Count me in the people that like that kind of stuff. I thought they showed perfectly in what humans would be capable of in case of a cataclysmic natural disaster, but then again there were also things that were unlikely to happen in case of that scenario. It doesn't really matter to me, I just want to be entertained and that's exactly what I got. Non-stop entertainment with good actors and decent CGI's (maybe not perfect but good enough to me). If you like this genre of movies Greenland is certainly worth watching. There are a lot of bad movies in this genre but this one is not one of them.",/review/rw7039429/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2020,captain_astronaut,4," Chekov's kid rule.
","If you introduce a child's ailment in the first act, it has to be used by the second act. The fingerprints of talentless executives is all over this. Someone said, ""the kid has to be sick so it can be a plot point later."" They also said ""the marriage is on the rocks only to be rejuvenated by the end."" Plus the classic ""The family has to be separated so they can impossibly find each other later."" And don't forget ""There's gotta be an old crank who refuses to leave his home, even though he's going to die.""",/review/rw7039429/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2020,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," Not what I was expecting, but it unexpectedly worked.
","If you're going into this expecting some high-stakes thrills and excitement with mind-blowing action and effect, you'll probably be disappointed, because that's what we've all become accustomed in these type of films. But in an unexpected and refreshing change, writer Chris Sparling made this story more about family dynamics and humanities quest for survival during an extinction-level disaster. This felt less Hollywood-ish, and more realistic than I expected, and that's a good thing. Director Ric Roman Waugh did a great job putting together Sparling's script. The 119 min runtime was just right, as was the pacing. The score was decent, but felt a little overbearing in some scenes. The casting was good, with Butler delivering as usual, but Morena Baccarin seemed bland in most of the film, and her constant side view during the car ride highlighting her terrible nose job was annoying. The score was decent, although overbearing in some scenes. I was disappointed with the 1990's CGI effects especially having a 35M budget. Nevertheless, a fun and enjoyable ride, and a solid 8/10 from me.",/review/rw7039429/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2020,hlloluna,8," Worth a watch
","Lot of end of the world movies follow the same storyline but this one had that little extra. Felt like the way they handled this was more realistic, so in a way 'scarier'. I usually like seeing a lot of the destruction and action itself but I definitely recommend watching it",/review/rw7039429/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2020,krogchoi-69376,4," One poor decision after another
","You know the scenes where you go ""oh come on, why in hell would anyone do that ?!"". Well, this movie is packed with characters having poor judgment and taking the most idiotic decisions possible (and being hysterical), and it's all done for the sole purpose of generating obstacles and create tension.
And it works ! It does create a lot tension, but it's all aimed towards the scenarists, for blatantly taking you for an imbecile.
You'll very quickly find yourself wishing for the death of some of the main characters, which would make things so much better, but then the movie would last only 15/20 minutes.",/review/rw7039429/?ref_=tt_urv

20 December 2020,rmmil,2," What a mess!
","Most of this film is just a joyless mess, and is filled with poor writing, bad science, and terrible character choices that should have left the entire protagonist family dead.",/review/rw7039429/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2020,siderite,8," Quite good for a disaster movie
","Gerard Butler is getting the apocalypse as part of his brand. He did the ... Has Fallen series, he played in Geostorm and will play in Afterburn, one could argue that Tale of the Mummy and Reign of Fire were apocalyptic movies as well. And so is Greenland. And it is filled with some of the clichees one would expect from a disaster movie: the average Joe and his family, the dissolution of society, the special effects. Yet this is one of the better ones, as it is well done and has some moments of real tension that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat.",/review/rw7039429/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2020,paul_haakonsen,5," Every bit of opportunity thoroughly squandered and we're left with a very mediocre movie...

28 November 2020,GabrielSymes,6," It's ok
","Stuff falls from the sky, there are explosions, lots of running around. It is usual disaster film fare. There's no clever story, no room for actors to stretch their ability. It starts and then progresses to a predictable conclusion. It's a film that will fill some time but will not leave a lasting impression.",/review/rw7039429/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2022,enochckchan,1," A disastrous disaster movie. There was 2012, and now there's 2020 but with a different name
","As far as I have looked, this is the worst disaster movie I have ever seen. Many people said that is has a deeper meaning than just a thrilling movie, but the exacution to express it was awful. First of all, this movie was really boring. It trys to have some intense moments but the scenes seem so flat. They were not exciting at all. Secondly, I don't really suggest of using the whole ""astroid crashing the earth again theory!!!"" as a topic cause it's like suddenly out of nowhere. For example, The Day after Tomorrow has a lot of explanations about why did the climate change occurred and it makes sense. But this one...oh nono. It just says history is repeating itself again but I am pretty sure that will only happen to human history not astronomy. Armageddon was acceptable because it doesn't just focus on that bloody stone, but the chemistry between each characters and what it could take for us to sacrifice for something was well expressed. It was a wild ride too. Although this film has also talked about the complicated relationship in the family, it's just the same old topic of a family and I don't find that signify anything. This movie...is just like a copy but more destructive version of 2012. I know it tried to express how people would panick or how would they desire to survive in scary situations, but if they are over written, it will be rather annoying. I don't think the exacution was good and they could have expressed more.",/review/rw7039429/?ref_=tt_urv
