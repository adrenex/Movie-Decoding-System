9 October 2022,DiCaprioFan13,10," Absolutely Amazing!!
","Vikings is one of the rare shows where it is never dull and full of entertainment. It's a show with plenty of violence, drama, mystery, etc. The character development is what keeps the show fresh and interesting. It takes you into this world of Vikings and keeps you intrigued throughout the series. I just loved this show so much and even though it hasn't been gone that long I already miss it! Obviously, the first four seasons were better with Travis Fimmel as Ragnar, it was actually one of the best shows on tv with him, but the show was still pretty good after he left (as long as you try not to compare it to those first 4 seasons). It was brought to Amazon Prime Video for the final ten episodes and really got back on track to end the series on a real high note!",/review/rw8589295/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2022,Supermanfan-13,10," Loved It!!
","I absolutely loved Vikings and I already miss it. Obviously, the first 4 seasons were a lot better with Travis Fimmel as Ragnar, it was actually one of the best shows on tv when he was still on it, but the show was still pretty good even after he left...as long as you try not to compare it to those first four seasons. When Ragnar was still part of the show it was one of the best shows on tv but even though it went downhill a little bit after he left, it was still a pretty good show worth watching. I thought these last 10 episodes on Amazon got back on track and ended the series on a real high note though!",/review/rw8589295/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2019,vandelour,8," Two Ratings - 8/10 for S01~03, 3/10 for S04~05
","Be thankful for what we got.. seasons 1 through 3. Fascinating program. The story of Ragnar, the acting of Travis Fimmel and the extraordinary detail made the first three seasons compelling. Tostig. My god, the guy had what less than twenty lines and stole the show. And then the bottom fell out of the show. Supporting characters were tasked with carrying the show and they weren't up to it. What was an epic story morphed into an epic cluster____ of pointless events, battles and internal squabbling to the point where I don't care who wins or loses anymore. And I""m sick of Lagertha and Boneless. Oddly enough, a secondary character, King Harald, had potential. Too bad he's sidelined as semi-comedic material. Excellent actor.",/review/rw8589295/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2021,southdavid,8," The Norse Remembers.
","With the release of the last half of the 6th season we finished the epic seven-year saga of Ragnar Lothbrok and his sons. Whilst I am not sure I'd consider ""Vikings"" to be amongst the very top tier of shows I've watched in my lifetime; I've certainly enjoyed my time with the Norsemen.",/review/rw8589295/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2018,Bored_Dragon,9," Hard and cruel, but somehow tempting way of life
","I'm not a fan of historical and quasi-historical films and series, so I didn't have big expectations. But first season instantly bought me. It's completely different than anything I ever saw and there's more dead than in Game of Thrones. Now I've finished the second season and the series is getting even better. It seems to me that there's also more intrigues and twists than in GoT. Acting and characterization are excellent and action scenes and fights are very realistic and convincing. Story is becoming more and more complicated and tense, and not only will it keep you focused, but also breathless. After first season I rated it eight out of ten. Now I'm raising to",/review/rw8589295/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2022,JohnM63,10," Epic story well done
","The series series originates in a true love for storytelling and cinematography. The story is epic with some roots in history. You may even see some references to issues in our current society, may it be because some themes are universal: love and hate, war and peace, the quest for meaning and purpose. This series has it all and has been photographed excellently.",/review/rw8589295/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,martin_merelesc,9," A series that was differentiated from another great series
","It is difficult to end a series like this to everyone's liking. Naturally, there are imperfections and successes; there are 79 episodes and calibrating and measuring each and every one of the details so that they fit together, so that there is no dissonance, so that the end, ultimately, of each character and plot makes sense, is something that does not usually happen. I particularly like the closure of the protagonists; there are details, however, that resonate with a shoehorn. The English creator was determined from the outset to differentiate himself from series such as Game of Thrones, with which he has been regularly compared (something I have never understood), and to adopt a historical vision in which to house fiction.",/review/rw8589295/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2021,avalosraul,9," Ragnar Lothbrook
",Seasons 1-3 and the 2nd half of season 4 are the best this show has to offer. But the rest is easily forgetful I do not remember a single scene that moved me or stuck with me. Ragnar was what made this show great. Vikings is brutal and has some very dark and complex moments. First 3 seasons 10/10 season 4 7/10. Spinoff would have been better for the sons. Ragnar deserved better and Michael Hirst didn't execute.,/review/rw8589295/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2019,poetictank,7," First four seasons are 9/10 and last two are 2/10
","The show completely dies in season four. SO MUCH WASTED POTENTIAL in the final seasons with Ragnar's sons, more specifically, Ivar. In history, he was the last true Viking to battle the heathens and try to take over their colonies. It started off so promising, too. Bjorn becomes only good for trying to bed every semi-attractive woman who carries a sword. It turns into stupid drama and begins to more so ressemble a cable TV soap opera.",/review/rw8589295/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2022,rockdude-68045,8," A binge-able entertaining show
","The seasons of the show all would be ranked differently for stars out of ten but overall the show was good and I enjoyed it. It was entertaining enough for me to rewatch it a couple of times and refer it to others. The acting was good, the storyline was good (for awhile), and it felt like glimpsing into the viking era through the dramatic tv lense that's fun to get lost in!",/review/rw8589295/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2022,Hegemont,7," Great Show
","It's a great show with good casting, writing, storytelling, shooting, visual and sound effects. It is not %100 historically accurate but it pushes you to search the real sagas and imagine the real people as you watch the series, which is a experience that makes you feel you are going back in time. It also makes you think how current life and viking age is different in every way. I would also say that they shouldn't ended the Ragnar-Athleston relationship, it was the only relationship that made me feel the real love to a friend. I also would have added more fun and supernatural elements to the show, which I believe could add more dynamics to story.",/review/rw8589295/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2018,memayrinck,8," Seasons 1-3 are a must see, the rest not so much
","Vikings is fresh, smart, as historically accurate as it can be considering the people they're talking about had runes as an alphabet, but the charisma of the story was the rise of Ragnar and his precise & quiet war strategy and tactics. Once that was gone and a bunch of Disney kids took over, it fell flat and stale. Unfortunate really because seasons 1-3 are possibly the beat thing on TV since The Sopranos. Killing Athelstan was also a bad choice because his dynamic with Ragnar was the real love story of the show. Still, a big fan, but now I watch it more out of obligation then pleasure, which is a sign that maybe I should stop? Tell me Seer! Should I give up on Vikings?",/review/rw8589295/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2013,pianys,10," The Gods Heard Me!
","I've been looking forward to a viking film or TV series for many years, and when my wishes were finally granted, I was very worried that this production was going to be total crap. After viewing the first two episodes I do not worry about that anymore. Thank you, Odin:-)",/review/rw8589295/?ref_=tt_urv

16 April 2018,nilsonsc,7," From an excellent TV show to an average one
","The first 3 seasons are excellent. I used to recommend this series to all my friends. Few episodes, good story, unique characters. Then the fame came and brought greed. History Channel decided to double the earnings by doubling the number of episodes in season 4. Without enough content to fill the episodes, the show became slow and boring. I decided to stop watching it by the end of season 4 because I realized it was declining. I don't want to screw up my good memories.",/review/rw8589295/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2021,therskybznuiss,9," Discovered this a few weeks ago - quickly becoming one of my favorites.
","First things first - the characters, brought to life by the brilliant performances are... spectacular. The writers, producers, directors, and most of all the actors were -all- so inspired - so much passion for the product, that every scene evokes its own life. Though the show is super serious, it dosent always take itself too seriously which is rare and very welcome.",/review/rw8589295/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2021,kosmasp,10," Not a History lesson
","Well I doubt that any Historian would find this to be 100% accurate. And that is not just the fact that you can hear the main characters mostly talk in english, instead of their native language. But the show makes it clear that it is just when eveyone understands each other that we as viewers also hear them talk in english. Otherwise you'll get different languages thrown at you.",/review/rw8589295/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2022,rise-n-shined,8," I really liked this show!

17 March 2013,loufalce,9," A Medieval ""Godfather""
","Maybe it isn't real 100 percent history. Some liberties were taken, but for the most part is seems to ring true.At times it almost seems like a contemporary crime drama, but the facts are there-the raids on British monastaries that did occur in the late 8th century, a fairly realistic depiction on what Norse life was probably like at this timeline, the spectacular countryside with its majestic forests and rivers, and the depictions of the Vikings themselves. Savage, eager to loot and plunder, but nevertheless bound by a sort of code of honor. Their acts are savage and the chieftan seems more like a medieval Godfather who uses his power for his own personal gain and who is not above killing somebody on the spot if he is displeased with his actions. The storyline is fairly literate and not the usual mindless adventure that too many of these movies present to us, and the characters are convincingly drawn and likely motivated. The music is good and the full size replicas of the ships are very accurate. Even the deliberate pace works to its advantage, we are never rushed and the story develops as it moves along. It is never dull and there is plenty of interest to engage the viewer. However, if you are put off by graphic violence , don't watch it. Those times were fairly brutal. Fine entertainment . Enjoy it.",/review/rw8589295/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2016,hptmbedra,," Trying to pretend first half of fourth season did not happen
","First of all let me say the first 3 seasons were good, in fact the first two were just great. There is Viking tradition, there are interesting social and cultural differences between Northmen and others, there is vibrant Viking society and mainly, there is Ragnar; cunning Ragnar, who would ""give far more than his eye to acquire knowledge"". He is a man of progress, whose logic and wit wins against rigidity and stupidity. He is the man, who comes up with new ideas and surprises everyone who wants to defeat him. Finally, he is the only one capable of carrying this show and pushing it forward. ",/review/rw8589295/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,bcnkor,10," Great series that revives Viking history for us, showing us our great mistakes and great victories
","Food is the first cause of the emigration of all past, present and future people. But if you feed it with the hope of having better things, you activate the interest of the person that in extremes not even god stops you, and in the Viking culture we have a great example.",/review/rw8589295/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2013,Robin_clarke41,9," Great entertainment
","As usual on IMDb fictional dramas set in a particular period in history attract the bores that insist on bleating 'its not historically accurate'. Well just ignore them as this is a fantastic and exciting look at the relatively unexplored Viking world. In the same vein as other fictional historical dramas such as Spartacus or Rome the plot centres around a single character and their family. We then take a brief look into their world and are shown how dangerous a place the world was at this time. The show has a quality feel to it not like some of the more poorly made historical drama around today (sorry but Camelot was just awful!). The sets are impressive and believable and the direction and framing of each scene is obviously set by a skilled hand. The characters are all interesting and likable and the acting is top notch. The only negative I could draw on was that there could have been a bit more action in the first episode but what action there was was very well done. My advice to you, just watch and enjoy it for what it is and don't be out off by the history buffs. If we insisted on only ever watching historical drama that was 100% accurate I'm pretty sure we would be watching none at all. Great show, a solid nine out of ten.",/review/rw8589295/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2013,bueandre,9," Finally a Viking series!
","I've been waiting for someone to make a good series about the vikings. I'm from Norway myself, and I'm naturally interested in our history. I've only seen two episodes so far, but I have to say - it really looks promising. The surroundings and nature in the two first episodes is exactly how it looks in ""Vestlandet"", the western parts of Norway. Stunnings fjords with waterfalls cascading down the sides. It really looks authentic.",/review/rw8589295/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2019,ksr-91822,5," Starts well then gets chewy
","The series starts well and gripping until 3rd series after which it gets chewy like bubble gum. Producers get greedy and trashing out episodes. While that part of world is easy on relationships, here it gets crazy by greedy producers. Thousands of people die but not many of the protogonists. Rajnikanth movies in comparison look very realistic and authentic. After watching few episodes in series 4, regret of manhours wasted watching this unending saga.

","OMG what a special series this is ...can't even skip a single episode of any season every one has its unique importance .... Bjorn ironside , Lagartha and Ragnar lothbrok omg what a father son and mother son duo ....means what a trio . Iust started watching in free time then I just had my heart on it and start making free time for it . If u want to see the real history the real meaning of greatness then watch Ragnar lothbrok then his wife shield maiden Lagartha and then their great son Bjorn ironside actually king Bjorn ironside ...... Ubbe, sigurd , and hvitserk had a unique importance but what Bjorn and Ivar had no one not even their father had . Ragnars death left whole Sweden devastated but it lead to a castrastrophic end to the legacy ... Two of the my personal favourite scenes ... Ragnar lothbrok's death and then the death of the true warrior the one protected by the gods Bjorn ironside my goddesses i literally cried on it ...compeltely took me of 😞 .
