5 October 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Classic!
","Everybody Loves Raymond is an all-time classic. It's a sitcom that is hilarious because of how realistic it is. It's your everyday family that will remind you of your own. Even though Ray Romano is the star and very funny it's the supporting cast (Brad Garrett, Peter Doyle, Doris Roberts) which separates this from other great sitcoms. While it may not be the best supporting cast ever it's definitely up there. This is a show that's been done numerous times before but not nearly as well. It's also one of those comedies that you can rewatch as many times as you want and it'll still make you laugh.",/review/rw4563238/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2023,Supermanfan-13,8," Great Sitcom!
",Everybody Loves Raymond is just as funny today as it was when it was on 15-20 years ago. If you look up any list of the best sitcoms of all-time I promise you that Everybody Loves Raymond will be on it. It's absolutely hilarious. This is one of those sitcoms where you can watch the reruns over and over and find them just as funny as the first time you saw them. You can have it on in the background while you do other things and just pick up anywhere in the episode and start laughing. The cast is perfect. The show is so funny because it'll remind you of your own family. There are at least a few characters in the show that you'll think was based off someone from your own family.,/review/rw4563238/?ref_=tt_urv

9 August 2007,Sylviastel,9," Why everybody loves this show?
","Everybody loves Raymond was a labor of love for the cast and crew for nine seasons. It maintained a steady helping of humor, love, and family relationships without missing a beat during those nine seasons. The whole of adult actors like Ray Romano, Peter Boyle, Doris Roberts, Brad Garrett, and Patricia Heaton really brought about the lives of the Barone family with both humor and love. Each episode is worth watching from the first to the last. During those nine years, Emmys went to both Patricia Heaton and Doris Roberts who both earned them multiple times. Patricia as Debra is almost flawless as is Doris playing Marie at times. No matter how many times that Marie can irritate us, she's playing the role of mother very well. Peter Boyle who is no longer with us was wonderful as the Barone patriarch Frank. Him and Marie were fabulous together. Ray and Debra's relationship was believable. Don't forget the endless guest appearances by the likes of Robert Culp and Katherine Helmond as Debra's liberal parents, Fred Willard and Georgia Engel as Amy's WASPy Pennsylvania parents who would become family at Robert and Amy's wedding, Chris Elliott who plays Amy's weird brother, Jean Stapleton appears once as Marie's sister, Sherri Shepherd playing Robert's professional police partner, and others too mention. They once took the gang to Italy for a couple of episodes. This is one of the last great family comedies on the air that did not spend enormous amount of time with the children as the central part of the show. Everybody Loves Raymond will remain forever in syndication now.",/review/rw4563238/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2006,blanche-2,10," The actual reality TV for many of us
","""Everybody Loves Raymond"" turns all those '50s comedies on their heads. It's not the Donna Reed Show, not Leave it to Beaver, not Father Knows best. It's family life with all its good points and bad, all the love and frustration, and all the individual foibles. Raymond is a sports writer whose parents, the domineering Marie and the couch potato Frank, live across the street from him. His wife Deborah is beautiful but can't cook and comes under constant criticism from her mother-in-law. Ray's brother Robert is a policeman who is jealous of him because - well, ""everybody loves Raymond."" This show is hilarious - my favorites are numerous, but one of the best is the lost cannister episode when Deborah swears she doesn't have a cannister of Marie's and then it turns out the kids had it. It falls to Raymond to sneak it into his mother's house, so on Easter Sunday he wears a down coat to hide it. I also loved the tofu Thanksgiving turkey, taping over the wedding with a football game, the fly eating woman dating Robert, Robert hanging out with his black partner and walking around in a yellow suit, the colored condoms on Halloween, the girl scout cookie debacle, and dozens and dozens of others.",/review/rw4563238/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2016,videorama-759-859391,9," Everybody Loves Raymond-well guess what? So do I
","I love comedies that are consistently funny, many times over, where the laughs don't all necessarily come from script, but from situation and timing. Other examples are The Cosby Show, Family Ties, and The King Of Queens. Now Ray Romano may, not be the best actor in the world, but he's acting comedic timing, in playing this kind of layabout hunky sports columnist writer, Ray, ha ha, is dynamite. His folks are played by two superb actors, who gave such great performances, both who've sadly passed away, one most recently (another sad day in Hollywood). I love household comedies, and this is just another household, I'd loved to be part of. ELR has a high ratio laughs level, and for people to say this is crap, honestly, this has left me dumbstruck. Ray's older, less fortunate, and big cop brother, Robert (Brad Garrett) too has wonderful comic timing, with great character to boot. He never slips up, where in stand up, he's bloody fun. I know too, the kids go very neglected here, with not much time on the acting field, but this is the right decision, on part of the writers, as this would take away, the hours of laughs, or magic within the other characters. ELR is one of the best comedies of the last twenty years, where disregard, totally the bad and unfair criticisms. Wonderful frickin' show, and honestly, how could you hate Raymond?",/review/rw4563238/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2015,DomNickson843,," I Miss My Childhood!
",Spoiler Alert! First off R.I.P. Sawyer Sweeten or Geoffrey Barone This show is the best thing I could remember from my childhood memories. I have always loved how evil some of the characters could be to each other because it reminds me of Family Guy and the Simpsons. My favorite characters are Robert and Frank out of the whole TV show. I really miss this Show because I grew up watching it with my mom. This show really had my feelings each episode it made me laugh and cry at times showing it did it's job on me. I really hated the first season because it just wasn't appealing to me but it sure got better. I really miss shows like these because I haven't seen a good comedy series since the end of this one. Family Guy is getting old and less funny and the simpsons as well. I'm praying that one day a good comedy series comes that could get my attention as much as this series did but I don't think that will ever happen anytime soon! :( Anyway I give this show a 10 out of 10. I really wish I had my childhood back where I could watch this series.,/review/rw4563238/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2016,priyankaguptais-36339,10," I have lost count of the number of times I have watched this.
","I first watched this during my vacation in 2011 and have watched it several times since. Its my go to series when I just want to sit back, relax and have a good laugh. I have not seen a TV series as perfect as this. Each and every character, the script, the dialogue.. Everything came together to make this the best family comedy show EVER. I watch a lot of TV and have watched almost all the popular series that I could get my hands on but nothing beats this. I love and adore Ray. His antics are really endearing. I see a lot of him in my husband and a lot of me in Debra. They are what every family is, with the regular day to day problems faced by all families presented in a satirical form.",/review/rw4563238/?ref_=tt_urv

","A lot to learn here for future creators and executive producers. The writing is strong from episode to episode. The series was handled exactly as a sitcom series should be handled. The care and wellbeing of the series characters is always in front and first in writing ideas. The final episodes of the entire series keep the viewer and characters safe and secure for future generations. Watching the ending of the series will not damage your viewing of the other seasons, unlike series which preferred to crash and burn the show as a whole on the final days. I am thinking of Seinfeld and Castle, both of which left the viewers asking ... ""what the hell?""",/review/rw4563238/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2022,variantways,10," Love it.
","Grew up with this show and I loved how the comedy attracted me because I grew up in Italian household and just how the life lessons are taught. The show offers a great amount of laughs, sentiment. The first few seasons start a little dry as all shows do but going forward as each season progress so does the show and writing. I highly recommend this show for a family or yourself, or with a spouse. The jokes are for everyone and will have you feeling content and happy. I thank The creators of this show because you have given me something to look forward to after my day of work where I can kick back relax and laugh.",/review/rw4563238/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2022,coreycitn63,8," I Love Robert
",My favorite character of Everybody Loves Raymond is Robert. Robert is the poor soul whose mother obsesses over Raymond and gets no respect from his father. Raymond is a whiny mother's boy and in order to put up with Raymond and his family Debra is a screeching shrew. Robert is the most tolerable character.,/review/rw4563238/?ref_=tt_urv

",Was re-watching this last night and my face hurts from laughing! The episode with Robert's new girlfriend (She's the One-- Season 7 ep 9)who prefers a Different topping on her ice cream had me rolling.

","It annoys me how a show like Friends has way higher ratings than Everybody Loves Raymond even tho everybody who saw both show knows that ELR is trillions times funnier than Friends ever was I just don't get these people I mean this show has a much better cast ( who can actually act ) unlike friends that was carried by David Scwimmer and also ELR has the much better storylines and scripts but somehow for some odd reason people enjoy watching a couple who breakup get back together and then breakup again and give the audience a headache with their "" we were on a break "" nonsense and another couple that was so boring to watch ...",/review/rw4563238/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2015,tvaoga,10," One of the best TV sitcoms of all time.
","Everybody Loves Raymond is just one of those shows you can't get enough of. I remember watching it as a child everyday before dinner, getting excited to watch all the Barone family drama and getting a good laugh out of it, even today. I absolutely love the characters and plot of each episode because as a viewer, you never really know what you're in for or what the Barones have in store for you and that's what makes it stand out in my books. Beautiful. Funny. Hilarious. You name it, this show has it all. If you're looking for a show where you quite literally form a special bond with the characters and stories, then Everybody Loves Raymond is the show for you. Great for the family and kids and never yields to disappoint. 10/10!",/review/rw4563238/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2022,seraichyk,9," Surprised by negative reviews
","I loved this show. It was smart and touched on many relatable topics. Realistic enough to be funny, but not so much that it's depressing. Can't imagine who is not finding something to love about this show. I guess if you don't like Ray Romano... but for the rest of us.. it's a home run.",/review/rw4563238/?ref_=tt_urv

26 July 2006,smooth_op_85,8," Marie's 'representation' of seniors
","Someone once posted a comment about Marie being a disappointment for seniors everywhere. The big part of it is this, that Raymond's mother is an exaggerated form of Phil Rosenthal and Ray Romano's Mother also, I don't get why people believe like with The Cosby Show (as far as black representation) that the seniors on the show have to represent ALL seniors or the majority of them.",/review/rw4563238/?ref_=tt_urv

","This show is by far one of the best comedies I have seen in a long time! Great acting, writing....everything and what makes this show so good is the fact that it is based on the life of Ray Romano (unless you KNOW it, do not write it).

","I love this show. It's hilarious. It has the weird, over protective, annoying, critical mother, the gross, dim-witted father who yells a lot, the over-looked first born brother, and the ""perfect"" second born son who writes for a newspaper and has a wife and 3 kids. In one way or another, you'll be able to relate with this show. I get mad when I miss an episode, even if I've already seen it. They're all so funny. The acting, writing, and directing are all wonderful. I think it's one of the best shows out there. If you like comedies about real life that aren't cheesy (like those so-called Disney channel comedies) you'll love this show just like I do.",/review/rw4563238/?ref_=tt_urv
