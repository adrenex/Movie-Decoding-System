28 October 2021,teenydutton,10," Lord's of addiction
","I didn't think this series would effect me so hard. I cried and cried throughout it. This series was my life! I am now 12 years clean after going through years of opioid addiction. Watching the scenes with them going through withdraw were the hardest bc I have been there and that was a way of life in during my addiction. Your day consists of how can I get more pills so I don't get sick and at that point the pills don't even make you high anymore your just taking them to be able to function. This was one of the best shows that really show how devastatingly painful and scary withdraw is. Im thrilled that they shined a light on pardue and other big Parma companies in this. My addiction started with going to the Dr for endometriosis. Nobody told me back then that you could get addicted. First time you go into withdraw you don't even know that is what is happening to you. Sad thing is, is once your heavily addicted doctors turn their back on you and society looks at you like you're a piece of cr@p. So very very sad. Everyone should watch this series!",/review/rw8063072/?ref_=tt_urv

","Firstly, this mini series shows the cruel reality of our society. It shows how the Legal Drug Lords aka Pharmaceutical, sell poison to people who suffers from pain. The message is real and clear.",/review/rw8063072/?ref_=tt_urv

",A really well done series that feels like a perfect reenactment that meets docu series. It was interesting and captured the entire story while still having its own style and great acting.,/review/rw8063072/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2022,deloudelouvain,9," Very addictive to watch.
","Although Dopesick isn't entirely non-fictional everybody knows by now what devastating ravages Oxycontin did in the daily lives of millions of Americans. It's the cancer under the opioids, easy to get and extremely addictive. This show is based on a non-fictional book, but the characters are most of the time fictional. That said Dopesick is a quality show, very well made, with tons of very good actors, and a story that keeps you wanting for more. Without spoiling anything you secretly hope those big pharmaceutical companies will get stopped but the reality like we all know by now is that they're untouchable and that's only the fault of a corrupt American system, like the FDA, the CDC, and many judges. The whole system there is rotten to the bone, too much money is going from hand to hand, from rich to richer, and it's not the common people that will change anything about that. Thankfully there are people fighting the system but except a few dents they will never break down that wall of corruption. America is sick, the whole world sees it, and nobody cares. Great show, great acting, very addictive to watch.",/review/rw8063072/?ref_=tt_urv

3 November 2021,lhollan,10," Award-winning, compelling
","The sad truth is that this phenomenal story of a network of corporate deceipt is based in reality. This series will take awards in multiple categories, including best series, multiple acting nominations, editing, and screen writing. Michael Keaton has pulled together the story of the century here, and the story line is written in a way where this complex, multi-layered travesty is exposed clearly and cleanly. This is streaming at its best.",/review/rw8063072/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2021,six2561,8," Truth is painful to watch.
","One thing that many of the negative reviewers forget when they go on their current-day diatribes about big pharm is that this movie STARTS over 20 years ago. Pharmaceuticals weren't as they are today. It shows how the door was allowed to open, causing this country to be in the situation we're in today with the Big Parm and incessant pill pushing. MONEY TALKS. Nothing else matters. Not the FDA, CDC, you name the letters. $$$

",Glorious cinematography overviewing with excellent music and riveting acting throughout its no wonder the rating is at a 8.7! I'm glad my mom recommended Depesick especially since our family is against pharmaceutical drugs. I love all the business stuff it's captivating seeing how it all plays out.. This is very worth watching I bet it'll be in the Emmys next year!,/review/rw8063072/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2022,TheTruthofItIs,9," Dopesick is pretty Dope
","""Dopesick"" (8 eps, 1-hr, Hulu) is a docu-drama on the opioid crisis in America and how it was brought about by Purdue Pharma's new-in-the-90s drug, Oxycontin. The series is really well done (except for jumping back and forth in time to tell the story) thanks to seasoned producers and directors. Michael Keaton leads the mostly unknown cast but Kaitlyn Dever (""Last Man Standing"") turns in an Emmy-level performance as dopesick ""Betsy"". Besides dramatizing the opioid crisis, the creators Danny Strong and Beth Macy wanted to ensure you realize how bad/evil/greedy Purdue Pharma is (not was) and the Sackler family's shameful role in it. And since the elections of 2016/2020 shook our faith in federal govt leadership and Big Tech, this series certainly piles on adding Big Pharma to the pile of disgusting graft, revolving doors, and corruption via insider favors in the service of boundless profits over the health of the populace. Yes, you'll earn your newfound cynicism after completing ""Dopesick"".",/review/rw8063072/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2021,tfp-15576,9," US big pharma
","Very well done and another example of how messed up the medical system in the US really is in almost every area. Overun with lawyers, charlatans, liars, cheats and thieves. ALthough not specific to just big pharma it also shows again the incestuous relationship between the 1% and the governing bodies. Whether its lobbying,marketing or whatever else they call it this decade, the corruption is totally embedded within our system. The movie is a teaser, go look at the real investigations for an even more worrying story.",/review/rw8063072/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2021,frank-liesenborgs,10," This is an absolute must! Blown away!
","The moment these mini-series started, I was ""hooked"". This is a story beyond comprehension. Reviewing this is easy. Plot, storylines, acting and the filming is all done exceptionally well and close to perfection. Especially the acting of Michael Keaton (Dr. Finnix), Will Poulter (Billy) and Peter Sarsgaard (US attorney) Rick. Michael Stuhlbarg, who plays Richard Sachler, also delivers and outstanding performance. My complements to the latter as this is a role not easy to play. A tiny Appalachian mining town, targeted by Purdue as part of its mission to overcome doctors' reluctance to prescribe opioids is just a drop in the bucket but very well used to feel like this could (and was or is still) happen to anybody. Over the eight episodes this story is so well construed that it is still very difficult to believe this could happen. Makes you think about all the things happening right now and we are unaware of. And finally, Danny Strong. Unbelievable writing and directing! You MUST watch this! 10/10 rating without any doubt.",/review/rw8063072/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2021,rbost-70233,10," Early in, very good so far
","Interesting subject. I'm 65, in pretty good shape. I have a basic mistrust of medicine in general. Have zero prescriptions, have had very few over the years. I talk to folks my age and older and the amount of prescription drugs they take is staggering. I'm not anti-vax just anti-drug. This movie will prove to me something I've suspected, rather known for years. Big Pharma ain't our friend.",/review/rw8063072/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2021,catfanatic888,10," Flat out Perfect! Everyone should watch this!
","This true life story is a master class in it's entirety. The opioid epidemic has swept our country like a giant tsunami. It's not just addicts who get hooked on these. I know several people with chronic pain who got put on these. One of them was considering using heroin instead because it was much cheaper. 10 years ago I was treated for a large swollen bruise. The doctor put me on Vicodin for 6 weeks. When I was done with my prescription, I had severe insomnia. That same doctor put me on Xanax for nearly 10 years. That did a number on my kidney and liver not to mention that it was SO hard to kick. If it seems like you're being given excessive meds, get a second opinion I never had an addiction problem in my life before that. Avoid Opioidfs if at all possible.",/review/rw8063072/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2021,alidortaj,10," This show is Addictive
","Don't watch this show if your are addicted to binge watching tv shows, because this show will get you hooked. The story is a time lapse (going forward and backward in timeline). I'm a Big Fan of Micheal Keaton movies, Will Poulter, and other cast do a great job. Would definitely recommend this show.",/review/rw8063072/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,tjnesheim,10," The answers to my husband's demise
","This so clearly explains why my husband was given OxyContin after breaking his back. The dose initially helped, then it didn't. The doctor quickly increased his dosage. This continued to happen until he was at 100mg. At that point, the doctors are only drug dealers. I wrote letters to my husband's doctor explaining he was semi conscious on a good day. It all fell on deaf ears and this series explains why. I almost lost my husband, I lost the marriage I knew and he lost all respect from his daughters. Fortunately, he was arrested for a DUI, without harming anyone. I made him plead guilty, so he could experience every thing he had risked. That was his rock bottom. He has been off OxyContin for almost 5 years. Yet doctors are still trying to prescribe OxyContin for his chronic pain. I hope this series helps everyone see OxyContin is a horribly addictive and ineffective pain medication.",/review/rw8063072/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2021,Ottodane,10," Excellent. Realistic. Moving.
","I am a recovering heroin addict, who started with Percocet because of an injury, and very soon found myself on OxyContin. This show is unlike any other in it's portrayal of addiction. Withdrawals in particular are shown here in great deal where most shows barely touch on it if at all. They just nail everything. Every plot line is so well written and acted as well as informative. Just a great show all around it will blow your mind it's a true story at times. 10 stars from me.",/review/rw8063072/?ref_=tt_urv

","No pain intended - no wait I meant no pun intended of course. What a show! I mean I had heard about Oxy (as it is being called too), but seeing the story behind it - how it got ""approved"" and how it went on to be available for so long, how it affected so many people, because the system did not work. And there I was thinking, well if the US and the FDA approves something or let's people sell that thing ... it can't be that bad, now can it? I reckon I was quite wrong there.",/review/rw8063072/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,Almost_Soldout,10," That's 10/10 for sure!
","The show is perfectly balanced between entertaining and educational aspects. I am not sure how would I rate this one if I was from the US and familiar with this crises as I was raised outside of this country and I was a kid in 90. I truly find this show brilliant and stunning. The characters, storylines and various angles on that are well made! Highly recommended to everyone!",/review/rw8063072/?ref_=tt_urv
