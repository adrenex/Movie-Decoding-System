","It's 1557 France. Mary (Adelaide Kane), Queen of Scots, has been hidden away at a convent for her safety since age 9. She is engaged to childhood friend Prince Francis, the future King of France. After a failed assassination attempt, she is sent to the French court. King Henry II is tyrannical. Queen Catherine de' Medici (Megan Follows) is a scheming survivor. Nostradamus is her adviser. Sebastian 'Bash' de Poitiers is the King's bastard son. Mary is joined by her friends from Scotland; Aylee, Greer Norwood, Kenna, and Lola. Mary has to navigate the royal court intrigue and the bubbling conflict between Protestants and Catholics. There is the scheming Lord Narcisse, the self-obsessed Princess Claude, and finally Queen Elizabeth of England.",/review/rw2890715/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2013,oddity94,," A guilty-pleasure period drama.
","If you want historical accuracy do not watch Reign. I repeat. DO NOT WATCH. At no point does this show ever try to be faithful to its settings or historical figures. Instead, it very clearly tries to put Gossip Girl in a 16th century setting. The lavish parties, prom-like dresses, troubled romances, catty behaviour, model actors/actresses - it's all very 90210- esque. However, I must admit it succeeds at doing just that. No matter how laughable the costumes were, I can't say I wasn't at least mildly entertained. It's quite nice to look at and some of the characters are interesting (if completely inaccurate). And with a supernatural twist, it's quite clear that the creators are simply using the characters and setting as a starting point to tell their own stories. I might keep watching, only to see something different from the CW.",/review/rw2890715/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2017,bryanmendez100,9," Its more fantasy than history but its a damm good show if you give it a chance.
","For all of the people complaining about the historical accuracy please stop. You want exact history go watch a documentary or a read history book. This show is awesome has a little bit of everything. At first i wasn't into it until a few episodes went by and then i got hooked on it. Great characters and good story line. I like it just as much as the Tudors series. Romance, politics, drama, betrayal, and great characters. Hate to see it ending at season 4.",/review/rw2890715/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2013,macadam122,6," Fantasy
","I'll start by saying I'm Scottish with a reasonable knowledge of the times in the drama and this is bunkum BUT it is enjoyable bunkum with a very beautiful Mary and some of the best music I've heard on a TV show since the new Battlestar Galactica. Think 'The Borgia's' without Jeremy Iron's pope and you will be on the right lines when you imagine what 'Reign' is like. It's actually so pretty, and the music is so great, that I really want them to dump the historical narrative altogether and disappear off into a fantasy world where they can make up their own ending and create their own marriages and alliances as they go along. Adelaide Kane is a gorgeous Mary - in fact I keep forgetting it's supposed to be Mary Queen of Scots and getting confused with 'Snow White'. That girl was just born to wear red roses in her hair. Her young French prince is the ringer for the younger of the Borgia sons and is very easy on the eye - and talking about eyes, the 'bastard' brother to the French prince is another honey. And then we get on to the pagans in the woods, the conspiring Queen and the enemies all around. It's quite sumptuous. As I say, it's nonsense; it's absolutely not to be taken seriously, but I will carry on watching it because it is all just so darned enjoyable and glorious in it's wrongness. And the soundtrack is just breathtaking.",/review/rw2890715/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 2013,MikeWright75,2," Pile of Rubbish
","If you're going to make an historical series at least get it accurate. I've never seen so much rubbish. It soon devolves from a reasonably good start to a sexed up teen sojourn that has only the thinnest plot to do with Mary Queen of Scots. Typical American bastardised brainless fodder that they churn out to the dullards who rate it a ten. I'm not going point out the glaring mistakes, there's too many and it's all too tedious.

22 November 2014,MissSimonetta,7," Silly and inaccurate, but it's so much fun anyway
","The history buff within me reviles this show. The female costumes are so off from what was worn in 16th century Europe; they look more like a 21st century dream of the Renaissance. The melodrama is over-the-top and sometimes silly. The characters are all,of course, much more attractive than they were in real life.",/review/rw2890715/?ref_=tt_urv

18 October 2013,kmichaelpm,1," Opportunity Missed
","All the ingredients were there. Decent costumes,decent sets,fair script and good quality camera work. However, the director simply could not decide which direction he wanted to go. Whether to make it a modern take on a historical theme or make it an authentic period drama. So, he decided to mix both. This obviously failed. It is a series which will appeal to teenage girls, due to the fact that the female cast (teenage girls) act like modern teenage girls, to such a degree that I was expecting to see an iPad appear and or see them texting. The incredibly irritating background music is present for most of the episode, and a lot of the time it is a competition between the dialogue and the music, meaning that some of the dialogue cannot be heard. It had great possibilities, under better direction, but sadly the opportunity was missed.",/review/rw2890715/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2018,nightroses,9," Beautiful outfits
","This series has been entertaining, dark in places, beautiful costumes and great stories. There's a lot of nasty reviews on the internet because it doesn't appeal to everyone. I don't like period dramas but I love ""Reign"" as it's very good. Some of the episodes are haunting and mysterious. Not everyone is going to like that because they want just fighting, tits and gore. It's a complex series, not too accurate but so what. It isn't a documentary. My only disappointment was the way the series rushed the ending of Mary's life. However it's a beautiful series and moving series.",/review/rw2890715/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2014,trail1965,1," Awful teen romance
","Having seen the beauty of THE TUDORS and the WHITE QUEEN ,and other similar historical dramas, I was looking forward to this account of Mary , Queen of Scots. I was disappointed within 5 minutes but sat through this drivel for the entire Pilot so I could give at least an objective critic. Let me say I enjoy a wee bit of creativity, and flexibility with historical ""facts"" but this is beyond that and has made a fairy tale story for the TV . If I was an American teenage girl I would probably love this ,but I am a middle aged English man who enjoys his history to be based on history and not some fantasy tale with overtones of some teen romance which seems to dominate TV these days , I was waiting for the vampire to appear. I was cringing the entire 45 minutes and this will be the last I see of this series. I really wanted to enjoy this , but the costumes and modern music just took all the enjoyment away and devalued such a fantastic story. They could of had Scottish music at the dance, even a modern take of Scottish , but instead ....",/review/rw2890715/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2013,mariared-849-823291,2," Not good at all
","I was very keen to watch this as it has such a high score on IMDb.I gave it a try. I barely made it through the pilot. I wanted to like this, because I love period dramas. Unfortunately I couldn't get over the dyed hair of Mary's ladies. The dialog is stiff and so cliché. All the young actors look like they are from a teen magazine cover. And when the dresses appeared to be purchased from a prom dress shop, was to much to bare for me. If I didn't saw any authentic period dramas before like those from BBC for instance, I guess I would have been able to appreciate this movie. Maybe if you see this as a fairy tale, you can enjoy it. But I was looking for something meaningful.",/review/rw2890715/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2013,phd_travel,7," Kudos despite the inaccuracies
",Anything that gets CW audiences interested in history should be applauded. I liked the lighter tone of the show. There have been too many overly sexual and perverse historical dramas like the Borgias so this one is a good compromise for younger audiences.,/review/rw2890715/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2013,alyss-intrada,7," Came for the History, Stayed for the Romance
","Some parts of this are way too painful to watch. I began watching it because I love Mary, Queen of Scots, but soon found that the historical accuracy of this was blown way out of proportion. Clothing (especially the dresses) - WRONG. Food - WRONG. Dance style - WRONG. Names of Mary's friends - WRONG.

3 November 2013,pensman,8," A Pretty Good Show but for What Audience?
","I doubt if anyone is watching this for historical accuracy, at least I hope not, but it is a pretty good show as it actually features young actors who can act, a decent plot, and nice scenery. The young queen and her attendants are more advertisements for attractive prom dresses during court scenes, and the music is certainly a lot more hip than Mary, Queen of Scots, would have ever heard but every thing comes together nicely. Definitely one of the more intelligent shows to appear on TV which should doom it. But I hope some audience discovers the show as it deserves a run of at least a few seasons. And who knows; it might even encourage someone to look into the history of the period. And come on; a show with a lecherous king, a plotting queen, Nostradamus having visions of blood and gore, and a castle spook deserves a chance. No doubt they were casting this series with a teenage audience in mind but really, how did they intend to hook that age group with a quasi-historical set piece feature characters they aren't familiar with and could care less about. Somehow they caught a few out of demographic oldsters like me who stopped by to see how they would mangle history but stayed as the wrong audience. Other ancients might like Isabelle in Spanish with subtitles on Hulu.",/review/rw2890715/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2013,Barry0169,2," Completely unwatchable
","I love historic shows, but this one doesn't qualify. The characters are real (though hardly realistic), but that's about it. I've read several books on Mary and most of the incidents in this episode are not in line with what happened. A quick reading on Wikipedia will show the inconsistencies. We're supposed to believe that Francis and Mary are both 14 and that he was frail and sickly? Hardly the image this show presents. The dialog is awful -- using modern language in a quasi-English accent doesn't make it historical. The costumes are completely inappropriate for this time frame. The music was extremely annoying. I honestly can't find one redeeming thing about this show.",/review/rw2890715/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2015,ladybug2535,7," Total Fantasy--Historical Romance without actual history...Disappointing second season
","I liked the first season much better than the second. Year two turned into the season of the wimps. This season begins with King Francis allowing himself to be compromised; with the first half or so devoted to that storyline. This whole plot line seemed contrived given that a King, even one as considered and ""just"" as he is written, would have a relatively simple solution to his little ""problem"". The provided justification for inaction seemed pretty lame (as well as flimsy) compared to the costs and simply wasn't consistent with the character they've developed over the first season. They had already established that he is perfectly capable (if reluctantly) of being ruthless and his horrific concessions went against everything established about the character. I didn't buy it.",/review/rw2890715/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wow this show is rather dramatic and exciting. And although it does have an aspect of historical accuracy there is also plenty of scandalous drama which is a huge plus. I know a few people have been criticising the artistic direction the creators have taken with this show but if it was factually accurate then nobody would want to watch it. Without the love triangles, mistresses, murder plots and general chaos there would be nothing worth viewing.",/review/rw2890715/?ref_=tt_urv
