28 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,10," Awesome!
","Entourage follows and actor (Adrian Grenier) and his three buddies (Kevin Connolly, Kevin Dillon and Jerry Ferrara) as they move from Queens, N. Y. to Hollywood. There they find one of the best and most successful agents in Hollywood in loud mouth Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven). It exploits the Hollywood culture in every way. This show is strictly for people who are looking for a fun show. It shows us the life most of us will never know and has a good time doing it. It's the life most of us can only dream of. This really is one of the better shows I've ever seen...it's addicting once you start watching it! If you're looking for show just to show you a good time then give this a try. You won't be disappointed!",/review/rw8483993/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2020,Supermanfan-13,10," Loved this show!
",Entourage really is one of the better shows I've ever seen. It's about a good looking movie star trying to make it big while his friends from home are there with him for the ride and a hilarious and successful agent. It's addicting once you start watching it!,/review/rw8483993/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,DarthWalker-34381,9," Irresistible charm
","Loaded with cameo's of Hollywood celebs, set in sunny southern California, and carried by a fantastic cast (as well as well-written characters), this show just hits the mark and leaves a lasting impression. Some of the episodes slow down the pace, but there is so much good stuff that overshadows it. That good stuff includes the season 1 finale, nearly all of season 3, and the second act of season 5.",/review/rw8483993/?ref_=tt_urv

14 October 2018,Kingslaay,8," This show will get you addicted
","When I watched the first few episodes of Entourage I wondered what was going on and if I could be keep watching. But once you understand and get involved in this world you don't want to get out. It is both interesting, fun and full of colorful characters. This show is a hit and often drops big names like there is no tomorrow. Sometimes it even has a killer soundtrack. Great show.

16 December 2022,kbella1sal,10," The Best of Television
","I watch this entire series about once a year. Its so well written and the acting is Top Shelf. Its a genius production all the way and Spoofs Hollywood in a Funny, Smart way. The Five Main Characters are never boring. The action is constant and hilarious. The many cameos by all kinds of Hollywood Names shows how much respect there is for Entourage. I'm glad they didnt try to make it about Mark Wahlberg exactly. It wouldnt have been half as interesting. The Premise is Golden and everything else just added to it. What is Adrian Grenier, Kevin Dillon, jerry Ferrara and Kevin Connolly doing today? I compare it to Seinfeld, where the Characters are so much identified, its hard for these Actors to ever top their Roles...",/review/rw8483993/?ref_=tt_urv

20 July 2004,ranblv,," Look for this one to go the distance.
",There is no doubt in my mind that the most interesting shows have came out of cable in the last two years and this one is no exception. This show revolves on the life of a movie star and his entourage that consists of 3 friends and an agent (played brilliantly by Jeremy piven) If I have to sum up this show in one sentence it would be:,/review/rw8483993/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2006,Shapster11,," Ride of a Lifetime
","Entourage follows the great HBO series tradition of sharp cutting edge comedy and, as other HBO shows have been, addictive. The first season was a trial balloon for this very hip, and hip hop, version of life in the fast lane. It succeeded better than HBO envisioned. The second season was a full 15 episodes and now fans are eagerly awaiting Season 3 in June.",/review/rw8483993/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2019,ChubbyChecker,8," Shallow, relatively vapid, yet solid entertainment
","I could tell you that Entourage is a self critiquing magnifying glass on what it means to live the Hollywood life. In some ways that's true, Entourage is about that. Ultimately though I suggest you don't take the show too seriously and just enjoy the ride for what it's worth. Either you'll enjoy it or you won't, just don't waste too much time thinking about it.",/review/rw8483993/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2018,sydbuyer,10," 11/10 - honestly.
","Hands down one of the best shows ever created. This series could have gone forever, really. Every character was a bullseye from the first episode, and every episode leaves you smiling ear to ear, not often you can say that.",/review/rw8483993/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2004,winnr,10," Cool
","With a full season now out of the way, as a whole, I am definitely impressed with what I've seen over the last 8 weeks. I like all five of the main characters and believe all the actors to have done a good job at portraying these guys. A special nod, of course, goes out to Piven for what he's done with Ari and the same for Kevin Dillon as Drama. I realize a lot of people don't buy Grenier as 'Vinny' (to quote Ari), but I think he plays him well. Same with Ferrara as Turtle. This guy may act like a loud-mouth goof ball most of the time he's in front of the camera, but I definitely see Queens coming from him. And then there's Eric, the ""cynic"" of the group. He may be cynical, but he's also very practical and seems to be the sole reason that things haven't fallen apart up at the mansion. He keeps them all in line and makes the decisions for Vince. A very cool character indeed.",/review/rw8483993/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2021,ann303,10," You wanna hug it out?
","Entourage is one of my all time favorite HBO series. I find that I rewatch this show in its entirety about every year and a half or so. The writing is smart and hilarious, and the characters are well developed. All the actors are wonderful, and Jeremy Piven is the standout for me, as manic agent Ari Gold. Through all the Hollywood ups and downs, the thing I find the most endearing about this show is the loyalty and love these friends have for each other. No matter what the situation or circumstance, these lifelong friends are always there for each other, even if it means absolute brutal honesty with each other. For me, Entourage was never a show about show business, it was a show about friendship.",/review/rw8483993/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2020,sethwilliamramos-80670,9," The best show of all time
","'Entourage' (2004-2011) created by Doug Ellin is the best show of all time. Why? Because it is a show about friendship and loyalty and the life of a film star. Everything from cameos of A-list celebrities and amazingly written, hilarious characters. A show that always makes you feel good.",/review/rw8483993/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2022,freshst-53933,10," The greatest
","I've seen all the great tv shows. But, technically I would like to nominate Entourage as the greatest tv show of all time. Where do I start? I don't know. Just watch it for the first time or watch it again, and all I ask is you hear my voice distantly kept in the back of your mind- ""the greatest show of all time"". Maybe you'll come to the same conclusion as I have.",/review/rw8483993/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2021,bobbydecman,10," The best TV show I've watched
","I've just finished season 6 and I absolutely loved this show. I'm honestly speechless, it's that good. The chemistry between the guys, the comedy aspect of it, the drama (Johnny!)... Singlehandedly the best piece of TV I've watched in my life, that's how good it was. Everyone on this show deserve the credit, the attention to the detail, production quality, just amazing. Well done.",/review/rw8483993/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2004,whoTheFuqRyou,," Glamorous show - most importantly it's intelligent and good-hearted fun
","I know that the show has only started however I must comment on this show. It's realistically innovative as it takes four friends from N.Y., one who happens to be an actor w/ the other three along for the ride. It really gives an insight as to what actors nowadays go through as far as roles taken and career moves - not to mention a reaction off of a bad review from a critic. With that said all of the characters are likable but so far it's Kevin Connolly and Dillon who are standing out so far, the other two play their parts respectively well and I'm hoping this show does well as I'm already treating it with the same respect as I'd treat The Wire and The Sopranos...",/review/rw8483993/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2005,Martina_Helene,," Quick, light, and fun as hell!
","Once again HBO bangs out another great TV series. This time a comedy revolving around up and coming heart throb of the moment Vincent CHase and his close group of friends and his ""trusty"" agent, aka, his Entourage. The writing is one of the best things about this show-it's amazingly funny and true to life, this TV show is universal for so many people, even if it is in an uncommon setting. The acting is getting close to being on par with the other amazing HBO shows (ehm...The Sapranos) and has gotten better as the two seasons have progressed. I would have to say (along with many others) that Jeremy Piven gives the best performance out of the cast as the rich, funny, and kinda frightening agent. I really am in love with this show. I watched one or two episodes of the first season and a few snippets of the other season one episodes and I loved it. I then started watching the second season and loved it even more! I got the first season on DVD and watched all of the episodes, and it really gave me all the background I needed to fully understand some of the inside jokes in season 2! I would definitely suggest watching the 1st season and getting the DVD set, and if you haven't started watching the show yet-DO IT on Sundays at 10 PM on the one the only HBO!",/review/rw8483993/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2005,Maw7391,," The best show on TV, cable anyway.
","This show is absolutely hilarious. The thing that makes the dialogue so great is that it is what a lot of people in the early 20's use. Whomever writes the screenplay for this show ought to win an award. So many movies and TV shows lack what I call ""everyday people language"". Too many TV shows and Movies have stupid one liners and overall dialogue that just isn't what ""real"" people say. Its refreshing to watch a show that nails it perfectly. I would pay to see an ""Entourage"" movie easily. Jermey Piven as ""Ari"" is incredible. He is exactly what I picture a Hollywood agent to be. He deserves some sort of award for his role. The only thing I hate about the whole show is that it is only a half an hour long and only on once a week. I hope this show goes on for years. The Billy Walsh character is interesting with all of his quirks and superstitions.",/review/rw8483993/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2020,francesca_danny1,10," They don't make 'em like that anymore.
","You know it's a good show when you watch it for the second time and you like it more than you did before. Can you imagine a show with all the great modern actors? Well there you have it.
I must say that these guys have simply just rocked this show and they have portrayed their characters as if it was all real. Not to mention Ari Gold's character who you may fall in love with starting episode 1. This show was and still is a masterpiece!
p.s: I will watch it again in a few years. I cannot wait.",/review/rw8483993/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2022,zarkobilal,9," A cultural phenomenon with brash, male humour and heart
","This is a comfort-food show centered around a young movie star and his friend-group navigating the fast life of Hollywood. The show is essentially every young male's fantasy - getting rich and famous and bringing your friends along for the ride. The ride includes tons of gratuitous partying, women, sex, and a few small road bumps to keep us from boredom.",/review/rw8483993/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2022,clovisfoster,10," My favourite TV show of all time!
","I first came across this show back in 2006 during a holiday. It was being advertised hard on HBO, but I never bothered to watch it at the time. About a year later I randomly ended up seeing an episode. I was immediately addicted. During its original run, one of my highlights of the year was the new season of Entourage dropping. This show has everything. It's so funny, stylish and perfectly cast.",/review/rw8483993/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2022,chrissuar32,10," My favorite show of all time.
","I don't know if it is the period of time in which this show was created, the storyline, the actors/actresses, the scenery, or a combination of it all... but it remains my favorite! The only other show to come close to making me feel so connected to the characters was Californication (which happens to be from the same period of time.) Jeremy Piven as Ari might be my favorite character of all time. His well-timed humor and ridicule is hilarious regardless of what people say. People can say this show didn't age well because of cancel culture, the #metoo movement, or political correctness, but the fact is that was Hollywood at the time. I wouldn't have this show any other way, and I hope it's true fans never change their opinion of it.",/review/rw8483993/?ref_=tt_urv
