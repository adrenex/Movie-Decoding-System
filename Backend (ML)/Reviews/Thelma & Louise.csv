8 March 2021,cherold,8," excellent sequel
","I don't remember anything about the first Croods movie, but I do recall it was funny. The same is true of this one. It's pretty funny for the first third, extremely funny and clever in the middle third, and pretty funny but exciting in the final third, so all-in-all it's very satisfying.",/review/rw6386701/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2020,SnoopyStyle,7," fine family friendly film
","Guy has been directed by his parents to search for a paradise called Tomorrow since childhood. On his journey, he befriends the Croods and falls for the daughter Eve. He reconnects with childhood friends, the Bettermans, who live in luxury behind walls. Soon, there is a clash of cultures.",/review/rw6386701/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2020,daisukereds,8," Now THAT is a sequel!
","What a visually impressive film. I guess it's something to be expected of this day and age.. but I still can't get over how good it looks. And not just hilarious facial expressions, structures, lighting and color usage.. but the injection of modern ideas and references transformed to an ancient period (the concept of a ""joyride"" and coming back late). The writers of this movie are pretty smart and creative! Almost geniuses!!",/review/rw6386701/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2020,Sir_AmirSyarif,7," A decent, pleasant sequel
","While the story hasn't evolved that much, 'The Croods: A New Age' has a line-up of talented voice cast, lively and colorful animation, some big laugh-out-loud moments, and a great message about getting along and working together to turn it into a decent, pleasant sequel.",/review/rw6386701/?ref_=tt_urv

","Fun family movie with a good heart and lesson that people seem to have forgotten in these DARK TIMES!! Lots of action, funny animals and colorful backgrounds. The voice casting is perfect! Kids will love it and so will most adults. I Really want a Wolf-spider! ;D",/review/rw6386701/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2020,Gordon-11,," Helps you to escape from the real world
","This is quite a fun, escapist animation. The really colourful palette and the very cute character really helps to forget what is going on in the real world.",/review/rw6386701/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2020,stevendbeard,8," Funny Family Film
","I saw ""The Croods:A New Age"", starring the voices of Nicolas Cage-the Ghost Rider movies, The Weather Man; Emma Stone-La La Land, Superbad; Ryan Reynolds-The Hitman's Bodyguard, Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle and Peter Dinklage-Game of Thrones_tv, Elf.
This is a sequel to the 2013 'The Croods' that I liked better than the first one. Don't get me wrong, the first one was good but this one was even better. Nicolas returns as the head of the Croods, a prehistoric family that has adopted Ryan-Ryan is sort of like the next step up in the human evolutionary scale-and they are just looking for a new place to set up a home for the family, or as Nicolas calls them, his tribe. Ryan likes Emma, Nicolas' daughter. In their search, they come across a family that knew Ryan when he was younger and their names are the Bettermans-and they seem to think that they really are the better men. Peter is Phil Betterman, the father of the family and he thinks Ryan should stay with their family, the Bettermans, instead of the Croods-he thinks the Croods are beneath them and are mere savages. There are lots of class differences between the 2 families and it takes some time until they can agree on things. It is a funny and never dull story that has some subliminal messages, but not too many that would make it preachy. If you liked the first one then you should enjoy this one, too, because it is a great family film.
It's rated ""PG"" for peril, action and some rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 35 minutes.
I-and the rest of my group-really enjoyed it and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.",/review/rw6386701/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2020,marmar-69780,7," The Croods A New Age
","The Croods 2 was a good follow up to a first film and i must say that i was expecting that this film wont be the level of the first one but i was wrong and im glad because of that.Story was good to me and i had a plenty of fun with it ,i liked relationships between Croods and Bettermens and how humor was used in such situations between them and jokes worked in a good way for me.Sure there were some messages that will annoy some people and decisions that are cliched but still i had a fun with this",/review/rw6386701/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2020,mga-65088,10," Perfect Family Movie
","This movie is spectacular with amazing set pieces, delightful colors and creatures it doesn't matter how old you are you can't take your eyes away from it. if you enjoyed the first movie, you will definitely love this one and obviously the animation is better especially the facial expressions of the characters are very unique. The cast is very funny especially Emma Stone and Nicolas Cage even though their characters weren't developed from the first one but they still very charming. The story is very simple as expected from a DreamWorks movie but the well designed action and the chemistry between the characters were good enough to keep you invested. I had so much fun watching this movie with my family I recommend watching it on a big screen if you can't catch it in the theater",/review/rw6386701/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2020,halomaniac88,7," Beautiful, colorful and very imaginative
","The story and dialogue is pretty cliched but the animation is amazing. Just a beautiful movie. I love all the hybrid animals, who would have thought a wolf spider could be so cute.",/review/rw6386701/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2020,deothor,1," This is much worse than the original
",Animation quality-wise it's top shelf. But the plot/story/characters took a nose-dive. Characters devolved to being a bunch of meme-characteristics. Some characters were degraded even further to being nothing more than meme car-reference.,/review/rw6386701/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2021,oarch,3," Not for kids
","My son, 5, loved the first movie. I could tell he was bored with this one, he was wondering what were they saying and what was going on. I understand parents watch movies together with their kids so they have to include material to entertain parents too, but with this they managed to bore both the kid and the parent.",/review/rw6386701/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2021,michaelRokeefe,7," Prehistoric family is looking for a new home.
","One of the first prehistoric families sets out searching of a safer place to call home. When they think they have found paradise, another family, the Bettermans, already lives there. Beautiful elaborate tree house with acres of fresh produce, plenty of fresh water and scores of amazing inventions. It won't take long for tensions to escalate between the two families. Full family fun and beautiful choreography.",/review/rw6386701/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2020,PerryAtTheMovies,5," Introducing the Bettermans, but not a better made film....
",A movie reviewer is critical and that's what this review is unfortunately. If they had focused more on the meat and potatoes instead of the cotton candy this film could've been actually good.,/review/rw6386701/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2020,sipproject,6," Not as good as the first one
","First croods movie had something very original going on which made it stand out from rest of similar family animations. This one however tries too hard to be like similar movies. I was hoping to see more of the prehistoric world we got to see and loved in the first one. But this one for the most part limited to a little area, that was kinda disappointing.",/review/rw6386701/?ref_=tt_urv

","The first movie was suprisingly decent, especially considering how little it was publicised but this sequel was poorly made and overadvertised.",/review/rw6386701/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2020,trinaboice,10," Delightful and fun that will make all ages laugh out loud
","IN A NUTSHELL:
This colorful sequel to the fun animation adventure The Croods is now available in theaters after being put on hold in 2016 by Universal Pictures. It's actually the longest we all have had to wait for a DreamWorks Animation sequel, seven-and-a-half years! It's Joel Crawford's directorial debut.
It's great family fun with enough humor that will make viewers of all ages laugh out loud. In a Covid world, this is a delightful distraction.",/review/rw6386701/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2021,UrAverageMovieCritic,7," A wild animation that entertains, but also tries too hard to become something it's not
","Okay... this has got to be one of the most exhilarating and bubbly animated movie ever made. Thankfully I was just in the mood for something perky, not too childish but not too sober, so overall it was a positive experience.",/review/rw6386701/?ref_=tt_urv

21 December 2020,tarekali-19909,9," The Croods is one of our all time family favourites
","Seven years is way too long to wait for such an anticipated and rewarding sequel. The Croods is one of our all time family favourites. This new instalment starts of with a very sad opening scene but ends on a wonderful note of reconciliation and compromise. Completely packed with humour and action, part two doesn't miss a beat. There's a little less world building and fewer locations but imagination is firing on all cylinders. Please don't make us wait another 7 years for the next one.",/review/rw6386701/?ref_=tt_urv
