25 June 2005,Ginger87,," Used to be good...
","""All That"" used to be one of the funniest shows on Nick. I started watching it when it began back it 1995 when I was eight years old. I remember watching it whenever it aired with my sister and brother, who both also enjoyed it. Sometimes even my parents would watch it and get some good laughs.",/review/rw0352681/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2005,NYGuy322,," The old cast was perfect, the new cast is simply terrible
","Back when this show started in 1995, the cast, mainly the players like Keenan Thompson, Lori Beth Denburg, and Kel Mitchell, were all very talented and extremely funny, which made All That one of my favorite shows on Nick.",/review/rw0352681/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2004,basta_dustfinger,," older ones were so much funnier
","The older episodes were much better. Nowadays it SUCKS BIG TIME. I miss the old cast. The only funny thing nowadays is ""Know Your Stars"", which is getting old already. I remember seeing a really funny episode when a guy played by Kenan Thompson askes for a large fry, and accually gets a really big fry. Good Burger was good too! This newer stuff is trash. On air dares? Don't make me barf! BRING BACK THE OLD ALL THAT! ",/review/rw0352681/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2000,Ddey65,," Landmark Variety Television
","When I first saw this show on my aunt & uncle's Cable TV system, I wondered, ""Who are these kids, and what is this show besides the funniest variety show this side of Saturday Night Live?"" Now I watch it any chance I can get.  Some of the funniest skits include ""Vital Information,"" with Lori Beth Denberg(...and now Danny Tamberelli), and ""Ask Ashley,"" starring the seemingly irrepressible Amanda Bynes, a young girl so outrageously hilarious, she HAD to get spun off on her own show. In fact, if Lorne Michaels wants to bring SNL out of it's slump, he should hire her as a guest host. I'm serious. She's that good.",/review/rw0352681/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2014,bblack1-699-968577,6," They Knew How to Make Us Laugh
","I can very easily and proudly say that this was one of my favorite shows growing up. I think it actually had a lot to do with my crazy personality today! We all remember the cast, the characters, the sketches, the funny and memorable moments, and we all love them so much! I find it interesting, though, as I read some of the other comments, reviews, and blogs about this show on this website, a reoccurring line reads, ""The old cast was great, but the new cast was just terrible!"" And...I'd be lying if I said that weren't true.",/review/rw0352681/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 1999,RosalieBustingMyBowls,," Sigh...
","This show used to be really good when it first started out. Now, it's just getting old. The cast isn't good anymore, except for Keanan and Kell but even they are starting to lose their appeal. I don't know, in my opinion Nick just doesn't have the same quality it used to have ever since the evil and terrible Herb Scannel became president of Nick. I miss my old shows like Space Cases and Roundhouse, they were way better!! Bring back the classics, Herb (if your reading this)!!!!",/review/rw0352681/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2005,Supermodel609,," All That
","I completely agree, when ""all that"" first aired with it's original cast back when Kenan and Kel were on and that one girl who went on to do the Steve Harvey show, it was so funny! Remember the cooking show skit where everything is made out of chocolate! ha. Now it is the most ridiculous show to watch, it's very short, and all of the cast members aren't funny, they just act all cute and sit there all pretty and it's just stupid. It's a waste of air-time if you ask me. At least the old cast was funnier and more unique! I think Nickelodeon has run out of good ideas... I really wish that they would play some of there old shows like all that, and I used to love are you afraid of the dark!",/review/rw0352681/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2005,andrew_francis09,," Where have the good times gone?
","Where have the good times gone, with the fear of getting in trouble with the FCC or (gasp) getting in trouble with the parents of the young viewers, has led to a very dumbed down version on what used to be a great sketch comedy show. Be warned this is just a long overdrawn complaint. When I was a kid this show was classic, It made us kids feel like we had a show just like SNL, and it was funny. Now, we have fear factor like antics, no talent actresses that seem to ride the coat tails of their older sister, and no imitations, what happened to kids imitating their older actor counterparts. Much like new SNL, new All That has gone down the crapper, metaphorically speaking, Nick needs to bring back their classic shows for their younger viewers, soon.",/review/rw0352681/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 1999,JohnnyJohnHildegaard,," Funny TV show that seems to lag after a while...
","All That is a unique kids' show with many kinds of sketches (some that repeat) and a few distinct young preteens and teens. But as time goes by, there are only FOUR sketches... they should dump the music video (I'll get to that), and add more like Monty Python did.  It doesn't have to be intelligent, just fun.",/review/rw0352681/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 1999,Christy-17,," A GREAT AND FUNNY SHOW
","I'll admit that I only began watching All That in reruns about five months ago. I always knew about the show, but never had the urge to watch it. Then one day, with nothing else to do, I decided to give it a try. I was hooked before the episode was over! It is hilarious! Some of the sketches are not that funny, like Island Girls, Pierre Escargot and Peter & Flem (even though that sketch features my two favorite actors on the show, Kel Mitchell and Josh Server). The best ones are Vital Information (although it lost a whole lot when Lori Beth Denberg left and Danny Tamberelli tookher place-he's just not as funny), Ask Ashley (Amanda Bynes is really good in that), Cheese Police and most definitely Good Burger! I think All That is a pretty good show for kids-it really has nothing much that is harmful for children to watch (It's kind of sad though that I, a 22-year-old woman loves this show as much as my 3-year-old nephew!) The first and second seasons are the best, and with each new season, the show gets less funny, due to the fact that only three of the original members are still on the show-Josh, Kel and Kenan. But I really enjoy the show and I'll enjoy it while it lasts!",/review/rw0352681/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2005,miltank5,," its crap
","the new show is pure CRAP! when i was 4 (all that started) i didn't understand half of the stuff but it was my favorite show. Lori in the library was SO funny, and i didn't really get what Pierre es cargo was supposed to mean, but now i luv it! they should stop showing all that completely if they cant get funny people on there. the ONLY person i like now is Ryan Coleman and thats only because hes hot. i loved every single old cast member on the old show (i wish more than anything they would at least show reruns instead of this bull crap) especially Lori, Amanda, kel, kenan, Danny, and josh. i don't see how this show is even allowed to be on TV nowadays cause it totally SUKS!",/review/rw0352681/?ref_=tt_urv

27 August 2003,joseph_sobora,," The original All That from 1995-1998 are the best!
","In my opinion, The Original All That from 1995-1998 were the best years for Nickelodeon! It was fresh, original, and most of all is funny! After the replacement of ""My Brother and Me"" (which was replaced by Roundhouse and lasted for 13 episodes)on the 8:30pm time slot. SNICK decided they needed their third sketch-comedy to come on their scheldule. It was Michael Tolin, Brian Robbins, and Dan Scheidner (Both from Head of the Class)first production they had for Nickelodeon with the launch of their production company Tolin/Robbins Productions.",/review/rw0352681/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2008,robynh-4,10," Forget the newer one, stick with the classic ""All That""
","Back in the 90's, Nickelodeon was at its absolute prime, giving us genuinely funny shows such as ""Rocko's Modern Life"", ""Kenan & Kel"", ""The Angry Beavers"" and many more, including ""All That"". The 90's ""All That"" was great: the sketches were very funny and the original cast were talented (I especially liked Lori Beth Denberg); comedy was a natural thing for all of them and never tried too hard to be funny.",/review/rw0352681/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2004,gluba2000,," Once Good, Now TERRIBLE!
","This show was once good and funny, now it's terrible! It sucks! The writing today is PATHETIC! Sugar And Coffee? (And the kids today think it's funny!) The writing when it began was funny and good, i.e-Good Burger (which, by the way they REDID in a recent episode with a DIFFERENT ACTOR!) Some shows bounce back from their dark ages (like SNL, in the 70s it was good then it started to suck a little then Dana, Mike, and the crew came in and bounced back) All That, however, I doubt will EVER bounce back from the dark ages.",/review/rw0352681/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 1999,ArmyAnt2004,," Pretty Great Show!!!
","This is a great show. It is sometimes funny. Some sketches are not that funny (i.e. Pierre Escargo... Detective Dan... Fat Cop... Lump Maroon) But I do like most of the show. I'm really starting to miss the original cast members. Josh, Kenan, and Kel are the only original members still on the show. This is a pretty cool show on Nickelodeon.",/review/rw0352681/?ref_=tt_urv

","Just a few days ago I was telling my friend about how I missed the nick shows and everybody began to talk about it. I miss the FUN nick used to have All That, Are you afraid of the dark, and more. WHAT HAPPENED??? Nick has dropped to an all time low. I would love for them to cancel ALL of the new shows and air nothing but old shows their ratings would go through the roof^^^^^^^^^^^. I thought I was the only person who missed it but I'm glad I'm not. what happened to good burger, or vitual information with Lori. WHAT HAPPENED. Nick why don't you tell us all old nick TV watchers what happened. cause we want old nick back.CANCLE these unwanted shows right now: Drake and josh, Zoey 101, Chalkzone, All grown up, My dad the rock star, Unfabulous, and those other stank shows you have one nick cause of who they knows or who their related to or whatever.

2 August 2009,bearfaceproductions,10," The best live-action series Nickelodeon had, until the new cast came
","OK, I remember this show being a golden part of my childhood, I laughed hard back then and watching the reruns I still do. Kel Mitchel was one of the greatest actors in the show. It may have had cheap effect but it was all for the good of comedy, the actors unique style of acting made this show funny and I am still smiling. It was all good until the new cast came there and many new sketches were being preformed. I laughed at some of them and some not, but it was not as good as the old cast. I prefer the old cast far more than the new one. But I had to understand that they grew up and had to move to new places like in movies. When the new cast arrived the show was kept in a fair length for comedy, but then it got canceled. Dan Schneider should not have done that. But this place was where all the new superstars started; the old cast started good and continued to be good in movies and in other series. I give a 10/10 for the old all that, but a 5/10 for the new one and a 0/10 for canceling it.",/review/rw0352681/?ref_=tt_urv

","Here's the deal, it wouldn't be fair to review the new show because that would basically bring the score of my review down to a one or two. The old show was gold, I couldn't get my eyes off the TV and I just loved the old All That and whenever I would watch, I was guaranteed a laugh.",/review/rw0352681/?ref_=tt_urv

9 May 2006,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,9," Good show
","I used to watch this show when I was growing up. When I think about it, I remember it pretty well. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things I remember pretty well are the opening sequence and theme song. In addition to that, everyone was ideally cast. Also, the writing was very strong. The performances were top-grade, too. I hope some network brings it back so I can see every episode. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I don't think I've seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, if some network ever brings it back, I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.",/review/rw0352681/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2004,jellyneckr,," ALL THAT is ""all that!""
","ALL THAT was one of the first shows to ever air on Snick, the late-night block on Nickelodeon. It was a sketch comedy show, like SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE for young kids. ALL THAT had a simple formula, an intro with the cast members in their ""backstage room"", then show a few short sketches, and then close out the show with a live musical performance from a popular artist. Unfortunately, this formula got very old very fast, and sometimes the show would only be long enough to show only a few sketches. The original cast of ALL THAT was wonderful, with Kenan Thompson, Kel Mitchell, Josh Server, Lori Beth Denberg, etc. Those older shows were very enjoyable and sometimes absolutely hilarious. As the show got older, the cast members did as well, and pretty soon the executives were looking for younger cast members. Unfortunately, these new cast members were not as funny as the older ones, and pretty soon the show lost popularity, as well as quality. In conclusion, ALL THAT is funny for a while, but it is best to take it in small doses. Spawned a few spin-off shows; KENAN & KEL, THE AMANDA SHOW, and DRAKE & JOSH.",/review/rw0352681/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2000,Op_Prime,," The show started out great, but is now crashing and burning
","When All That premiered way back in 1995, it was excellent. The original cast was great, with bright spots being Josh Server, Lori Beth Denberg, Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell. Since 1995, the original cast has left one by one, leaving only Josh. Their replacements are not nearly as good as they were, but some are funny. Danny Tamberelli, Leon Frierson, Nick Cannon and that new guy (forget his name) are all funny. They make even the most horrible sketches bearable. But the other performers (Amanda Bynes, Christy Knowings and Mark Saul) are horrible and terribly unfunny. Yet they seem to get more air time than the funny ones. Kenan and Kel's departure forced the show to lose it's greatest sketches (Good Burger, Superdude, Piere Escargot & Repair man). Vital Information still remains, but is not as funny as when Lori Beth did it. For some reason, the very annoying and unfunny sketches like Ask Ashley remain. After Josh Server leaves, I can't see the show lasting much longer if things stay the same. To make it better, I suggest firing the bad performers and replace them with people who are funny. Boy, if a show ever needed an overhaul, it's this one.",/review/rw0352681/?ref_=tt_urv
