6 September 2022,jkanecoleman,3," Started strong but only got weaker...
","Devil in Ohio was a show I watched on a whim. It sounded interesting and I do enjoy supernatural shows and true crime shows. It starts off strong enough with a fairly open story about a girl who escaped a cult and made it to a near by hospital. From there the first few episodes do a descent job at setting up what could be a really great and interesting pay off. The problem is, that pay off never comes. Instead the characters flatten out, become awful versions of their initial appearance and make flat out stupid choices that will leave you thinking the last half of this show was either not finished when shooting or written by some different from the first half. To top it off, the ending is underwhelming to a level that made me regret giving this show time in the first place.",/review/rw8532093/?ref_=tt_urv

7 September 2022,ayameofazuma,3," Teen drama, not horror
","This show is not thriller or horror; it's more of a teen drama. If I knew that going in, I wouldn't have bothered. By episode 3 I was ready to turn it off because still nothing has happened. They try to make Mae out to be so evil, but she doesn't really even do anything wrong, she's just kind of awkward seeing how she was raised brainwashed in a cult. She stole a photo and a t-shirt, oh no! Cue the suspenseful music! They keep on playing the suspenseful music, but nothing suspenseful even happens to match it. They lead you to believe she poisoned someone, but literally nothing comes of it. Later she does do some ""wrong"" things, but it's just typical teen drama stuff, still not evil stuff. I almost gave this a 5 for trying, but it did nothing but waste my time, especially after the lame finale. Netflix keeps canceling good shows that do well to make room for new garbage like this. Why??",/review/rw8532093/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2022,chad-61313,2," No Horror, Not a Thriller
","This series is a drama at best. The title of the series is deceiving, just like the Devil himself. But he definitely wasn't in Ohio. Like other viewers have stated, it does start of intriguing, but that does not last for long. You will begin to feel like you're watching a LifeTime movie. The whole cult storyline was rather lame. I mean, if I was in an actual cult and watched this series I would be offended. I really had my fingers crossed that just maybe, maybe, this series would be worth the watch, but for me, it fell short. I couldn't connect with any of the characters especially the parents. And the actors playing the high school kids looked like they were left back for 5 years. I got bored way to quick but did watch it to the end, fast forwarding through the unnecessary parts that made me want to stick forks in my eyes.",/review/rw8532093/?ref_=tt_urv

4 September 2022,caseypthompson,3," It's mildly entertaining and incredibly frustrating
","If an actual girl is found on the road side and injured with cult scars on her back and tie scars around her wrists and is obviously traumatized...doctors, the police and psychiatrists in 'real life' would take the case extremely seriously. But that's the problem, no one in the show seems to take the situation seriously. First, they would have not kicked her out of the hospital so soon and been so annoyed and careless with trying to find her a home. Nothing feels credible - the acting, the way people respond to things, etc.",/review/rw8532093/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,Almost_Soldout,3," Expect as little as you can
","Netflix is famous for creating anti masterpieces and this one is another good example of mediocre content. Seriously I have tried to say anything good about this show but It's simply bad in all possible ways. I don't actually know who potentially can be a target audience, not a horror, not a thriller, not a teen focused, just a test drive with various directions leading to nowhere.",/review/rw8532093/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,lisajoann88,6," It's like a lifetime film with a budget!
","It definitely wasn't what I was expecting from the trailer- it's definitely like a lifetime movie that's been dragged out to 8 episodes with a high budget! Now, I'm not saying that's a bad thing in the slightest, but you have to know what you're letting yourself in for! It's cheesy, overly dramatic at times but it's definitely entertaining! It probably could have been cut down to 5 episodes and would have been slightly better! It reminds me of the Apple TV show servant with regards to the cult aspect! Had the same sort of ominous vibe- just wasn't as well done. I can't complain, kept me entertained all evening!",/review/rw8532093/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2022,ConchordsCanFly,7," Go in with low expectations, and you'll be good
","After checking the rating, I was I initially turned off by it (anything under 6 on IMDB is questionable) and just skipped over the show. After a night of not being sure what to watch, I thought I would give it a go. Again, with the low rating, my expectations were rather low as well. It surprisingly entertained me and kept me interested. I personally like that they showed less of the actual cult, as those scenes were the worst in my own opinion, but I could see how going into the show based on the synopsis alone would set your hopes high. Go in with an expectation that matches the rating, and you'll be pleasantly surprised and have you a decent show to get through.",/review/rw8532093/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,tgcme,3," a victim of the lack of arts education in America
","I have to assume the writers of this show are lacking any sort of quality education or experiences in the arts. Someone wrote a script using a paint-by-numbers method where they took every cliche, trope, story beat, and stereotype they could find in the script-writing for dummies handbook. I couldn't make it past episode one. I couldn't finish episode one.",/review/rw8532093/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2022,javiergarcon,3," How can she be that Bad of a mother and be a Psychiatrist?
","Seriously? With all that trauma and a professional Psychiatrist, she is a horrible mother of two daughters. The older Sister is bullying the younger sister in school, and the mother is not even talking to the older sister. There is no communication? Disney World, mom! I am sorry, but the devil is in the details, and this is a tremendous detail that sets the bases of the whole TV show of who she is. To me, this is ""Lazy Writing."" On top of that, the Actress should have stepped in and called it out if she is a mother. Can you imagine if she didn't catch it, then look how bad of a mother she is in real life? The mother keeps attacking the younger sibling like she is the cause of the situation, but the older sister is part of the problem by bullying her younger sister and God knows who else.",/review/rw8532093/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2022,kkmgirl-448-111988,2," Bait and switch
","I should have known better than to trust Netflix to produce an interesting ""horror"" series. Within 10 minutes I was wishing this was actually a 90 minute Lifetime movie so I could justify putting up with it. Just finished episode 1 and absolutely cannot go on. The clichés are strong with this one, especially the modern family with token foster child, magazine perfect home, super affectionate parents, angsty teens, and even charades (gag). Emily D is awful in this... the annoying psycho-babble (""no food shaming at the table"") and exhausting one note empathetic intensity makes this even worse than a Lifetime movie, because at least they know they're silly and run with it. This group is taking themselves way too seriously and it's boring. So far every character is really annoying me with their overly dramatic acting- especially the kids. I work at a high school in Southern California and if teens here don't talk or act like this, I highly doubt they do in a small Ohio town. I don't want a lame YA soap opera... I want a good old fashioned cult horror thrill ride. And I agree with other viewers- since when did cornhusk dolls bode evil?! Just shows what a trite attempt this was at horror. What a waste of potential. Bad move Netflix.",/review/rw8532093/?ref_=tt_urv

",The battle between good and evil often comes down to each person's perception. Experiencing abuse can have unpredictable results on those perceptions.

6 September 2022,Pairic,8," Devilish doings with good folk songs
","Devil in Ohio: A community of Devil worshipers control a county in Ohio and a teen girl Mae, (Madeline Arthur) escapes from them. She has a pentagram carved into her back. This is no lazy caricature of Wicca or other Pagan beliefs though, they worship the Morning Star in their anti-Bible is The Book Of Caleb, their first Prophet. Their rituals are cleverly imagined rather than hackneyed, they do however have a predilection for human sacrifice in extreme circumstances and setting fires to get back at their enemies. These devilish hotheads have a reach beyond their own County by bribing police and other officials. The series has some great folk music with lyrics praising the Morning Star. Through flashbacks we learn not just the young runaways story but also the history of the Satanic Sect, these interludes inform rather than disrupt the narrative. The main story line relates to the psychiatrist, Dr Mathis (Emily Deschanel) and her family who foster Mae and the trouble this causes for them. Gerardo Celasco is Detective Lopez who helps Mathis to investigate the mystery. Some scenes of outright horror but the terror is mostly psychological as an aura of dread and threat builds. Some interesting Scarecrows; one with a pigs head; the other with a head that turns. It also fulfills an old Halloween Urban Legend. Created by Daria Polatin based on Polatin's book of the same name. Eight episodes on Netflix. 8/10.",/review/rw8532093/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2022,ddsorrels,4," Agreed. Lifetime movie quality.

4 September 2022,bianca-423-52002,7," Go in with no expectations
","I think all the 1-4 Star reviews are a bit severe - perhaps by people who loved the book and expected something different. Don't get me wrong, this is no masterpiece, but it's a fun series that doesn't require much thought. I think the problem is that it was a bit too watered down, not enough horror, not enough thriller so often, it just meanders through - but still entertaining. Give it a try and don't pay so much mind to the 1-4 star reviews, clearly those people have never watched Sharknado which is actually deserving of 1-4 Stars. Bottom line, it's a Netflix original, it's only ever going to be that good.",/review/rw8532093/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am half way done through the series, was amazed to like this storyline. Satanic/cult content is tough subject matter that hasn't always appealed to me. The episodes are quite thrilling and the actors and sound effects are spot on. While the show is sort of a mix of a teen drama and crime drama, it somehow works for me. This show probably won't reach a mass audience, but it's worth trying out.",/review/rw8532093/?ref_=tt_urv

It did a decent job of weaving a wide range of complex psychosocial themes through the characters in a way that made each of them relatable and interesting at last once throughout the show.
