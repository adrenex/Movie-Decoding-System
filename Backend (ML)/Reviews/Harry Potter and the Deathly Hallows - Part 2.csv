16 July 2011,TheLittleSongbird,9," Gives meaning to the phrase, save the best until last
","I have enjoyed all the films and love the books, and after how much I loved Deathly Hallows Part 1 this entry, continuing from exactly where the previous film left off, had a lot to live up to. It is less faithful to the mammoth but very interesting and wonderful book than its predecessor. However I found this, apart from one or two disjointed parts where you could tell that details had been left out and the arrival in Hogsmede and the duel between Mrs Weasley and Bellatrix seemed a little rushed, had more flow, was better paced and had more coherent storytelling and less of admiring the scenery than the previous entries.",/review/rw7169516/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2018,nogodnomasters,10," LIGHTNING HAS STRUCK
","Perhaps this is the best place to review the series as well as the last installment. We have seen Daniel Radcliffe mature from a fairy bad actor to one that is fairly convincing, particularly in his standing up to Aberforth Dumbledore. Emma Watson has gone from awkward kid who wore her emotions on her sleeve to Maxim's top 100 Hottest women. The passing of Richard Harris was a major let down to the series as Michael Gambon couldn't really fill his shoes. The most interesting and complex character was that of Snape. Alan Rickman made the series with his portrayal. The casting of the quirky minor characters made the story most enjoyable, all the way down to Mrs. Fink. Rowling's use of classical mythology, astronomy and the occult made the series an incredible educational experience. One of my favorite characters was the under used Luna Lovegood. She was a breath of fresh air.",/review/rw7169516/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8," The series ends on a very strong note.
","The conclusion to the series hits some of the strongest emotional beats, mainly due to our long-standing connection with the characters, and provides some grand visual treats in the form of extended magical battles. While 'Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011)' may be the biggest in scale and it is entertaining, it does feel lacking in depth - since some things are left oddly unexplained - and instead comes across as an extended third act for its duration. It actually plays out like one long climax, with little of the build-up required to further invest the audience, but at least it's well paced and doesn't hang about. A strong note on which to end a phenomenal series. 8/10",/review/rw7169516/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2014,SnoopyStyle,7," Satisfying end to the series
","This movie continues right after the death of Dobby, and closes out the Harry Potter series. There is a lot of action in this one, and it closes out the series satisfactory.",/review/rw7169516/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2011,vila-ddt,," End of an era... End of our childhoods... End of Harry Potter
","What can I say... This was by far the most amazing finale any fan could have asked for. I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn't feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!",/review/rw7169516/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2015,hjpog,10," My childhood..
","At the start of J.K. Rowling, thank you for this wonderful series of books forever. I can tell you this current state of my childhood and my future. Sign up everywhere it has always been a part of Harry Potter's name. I'd say the most important series of my life. I owe my childhood such wonderful pass to the books and movies of this series. In this series, even though I know better than the series it has always been a special place for me in this series and it will always continue. This movie is definitely the best in the series. And the players is the most mature film. You feel throughout the film until the end of the final air and this is an amazing thing for fans like me. Book series as well as certainly never did. However, in each film it was pretty cool. And with incredible finale made this film. Harry certainly kept the best for last. Put all the music from the beginning to the end of the movie you are very successful and internal chills. You feel deeply cool is really going on. When the film ended up being a very big gap within you. Of course, you are a part of this world...",/review/rw7169516/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2011,Loving_Silence,10," Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II gets everything right to send off Harry on a cinematic high
","I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, they're all so great and magical. But I didn't think the film series were perfect at all, but they were still great movies. With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled!",/review/rw7169516/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2011,akash_sebastian,7," Good Movie, But a Disappointing & Unsatisfying End to the series...

10 February 2016,ironhorse_iv,8," Action packed, genuine heart and emotional drama made this movie, a very engrossing magical epic spectacle. It has everything, a finale should have.
","While, personally, I'm not the biggest fan of the books in which these films was based on, I do have to say, this movie is a great movie to end the Harry Potter film series with. 10 points to Griffindor & director David Yates! Author J.K Rowling would be proud. The movie is very memorable. It's so unlike the other movies, which I found to be somewhat boring or below average. For me, personally, this movie, by far, is the best movie in the 2001 to 2011 film series, because how entertaining, it was. To all of the millions of Harry Potter fans around the world; most of them, agree with my statement. Unlike the other movies that are cut into two formulaic plot directions; one being the subplot is which tells the student life of Harry Potter at Hogwarts, while the other, being about the mystery that Harry Potter must uncovered that year. This most recent one has Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his gang of misfits, Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) & Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) going to various settings away from Hogwarts, in a last ditch attempt to their school from the oncoming invasion of Dark Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). The only way, they can stop this, is to find, all the missing objects call Horcruxes; that hold a part of a Voldermont's soul, protecting him or her from death. Seeing how epic in scope, this main plot is, it was no surprised that this 2007's novel with the same name, was adapted into two feature-length parts, with Part 1, being released in November 2010, and Part 2 was released in July 2011. While, some people might have complaints about why the final book being split, I'm not one of those. However, I'm starting to hate the recent trends of films, split into multiple parts; in which this movie brought back. Still, I do understand why the studios felt like they had to. After all, there is still way too exposition sub-stories from supporting characters from the book to fit, even in two films. Despite the film omitting a lot of things, the movie is stil mostly faithful to the source material, with only a few things, change that I didn't like. One of the biggest faults of the film is how both young and old Lily Evans (Ellie Darcey-Alden & Geraldine Somerville) doesn't have the same eye color as Harry Potters. The reason why this is a big deal, is because how much, everybody in the film series, point out how Harry Potter remind them of his mother, because of his eyes. It makes no sense. Another big jarring confusing plot-holes, is how wizards, can or cannot being able to use, other people's wands. In the film, one thing that really baffled me, is how Voldermont thinks that he can't use the elder wand, until he kills Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). Yet, it's show, before-then, that he can indeed use that wand to do magic and other people's wand. The same with Harry Potter. It's weird, how the film makes it seem like they can't do magic without a wand, but yet, they show, them, just doing that with potions. Also, why does people still die in this universe, if Harry Potter has all of the three deadly hallows? Oh Snap! Didn't they establish that one of the wizards knows, how to heal himself with magic, if it's a bleeding wound? How is that character, even dead? Also, how can a living object become a horcrux? It doesn't make sense. In my opinion, don't bother, trying to understand the logic of all the wizard terms, because it will take you out of the fantasy movie, and give you a headache. The movie is full of unbelievable, deux ex machina that is very confusing, and not very logical. You just have to go with it. Nevertheless, I still don't get, why this movie is continuing its insulting black & white one-dimensional views of good Vs evil. A good example in this movie, is how everybody still treat Slytherin's house as an evil community of people, when the movie show that, there are mostly not!? Another thing, that bug me, is the fact, that the underage students weren't evacuated from Hogswarts. I guess, the school is trying to continue, its high death count record of being one of the most dangerous schools, ever. I swear, it always seems like the castle is always in danger. So, I wouldn't call the battle plot, anything new. It is very clichés and prediction. Despite that, the battle sequences are well done. Visual and special effects masterpiece. Lots of heart-breaking, yet fun moments. The music by composter John Williams really set the tone of the film, as always. The pacing for this film is also not a drag. Very well-pace. It's the shortest of all 9 films. The main cast was surprising better, too. Yes, they still, have that wooden delivery in some of their lines, but at least, it's more emotional driven than a normal read-through. Also, the over the top hammy lines by the season actors weren't so annoying this time, because how few lines, they were given. However, I didn't like the Epilogue ending as much as other people did. I can understand why a lot of people don't like it; in a way it feels a bit jumbled because so many characters of this new generation are introduced too quickly, and it's a bit much to take in. I personally am not too keen on the idea. It felt like sequel baiting. After all, it's clear, by Warner Bros that we haven't seen the last of this world completely, as spin-offs movies are indeed, coming soon. Overall: In the meantime, I urge you all to revisit the world of Harry Potter for yourself. Check out all 9 movies. It will be a trip, worth taking.",/review/rw7169516/?ref_=tt_urv

15 July 2011,abisio,," In the future AVOID any movie with Mr. Yates as director
","Harry Potter's saga had many directors; I will not go back again to who was the best (hint; a Mexican guy), but by far Mr. Yates was the worst. Mr. Yates was only interested in make an easy sell PRODUCT. The only reason the first was paced was to fill out two movies with only one book. Now, we are at the end so WHO CARES, let's just finish it, get the money and keep going. Clocking barely two hours, it feel rush and incomplete; missing lots of interesting (and even important) parts on one of the richer book of the series. Hermione and Ron do almost nothing; the others even less. Harry gets a lot of screen time but not necessary good scenes. Even the battle at Hogwarts (the only part Mr. Yates seems to be interested ) is a lame copy of ""The Two Towers"" without any kind of emotion. His direction so bad and unimaginative that when most of the characters die; we do not feel anything. In brief; worth seeing to understand how better the book is and because it is the last one; but AVOID any further movies with David Yates as director.",/review/rw7169516/?ref_=tt_urv

19 July 2011,TourettesPersonal,9," Better Ending
","Endings are usually the problems of most movie series. They usually end up being mediocre & unsatisfying or they are made to cash in people. The great thing about Harry Potter movies, the filmmakers are taking their job seriously. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a great ending of the series. It's more than throwing a lot of action and exposition. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is one of those conclusion that actually care about the series.",/review/rw7169516/?ref_=tt_urv

14 July 2011,cchip96,10," ""It all ends"" well
","This movie could not do any better, it ended the Harry Potter series with a bang. It is a good balance from the first part of The Deathly Hallows. The first part was more of a drama, while part two was action packed left and right. This may be my favorite movie of the series, though all of them are equally amazing. I have read the books, and there are definitely major changes in the movie, but I find they fit perfectly well with the story, even if it isn't the original plot. Even for those who haven't read the books (why wouldn't you?!), it is equally enjoyable. This movie, along with the rest in the series, will be loved for years and years to come.",/review/rw7169516/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2011,rsre4-1,," Too Bad It Ended Like This
","OVerall it was okay, and will make a bunch of money. But David Yates was not the best to direct the Potter films. His method always seems to be to just get through the movie as quick as possible. This has been true since OOTP. The problem is that such a quick pace leaves out many key scenes and doesn't allow the viewer to make more of an emotional investment in the story and the characters. Deathly Hallows 2 was no different. It was enjoyable enough, I suppose. But could have been so much better with just an additional 10 minutes of movie. A few additional scenes and extending a few of them just a little more could have added greater depth and emotion.",/review/rw7169516/?ref_=tt_urv

",Even though I consider myself to be a huge HP fan I never thought I would actually give a movie from this series straight 10 out of 10. Just saw the movie today and the word epic is almost an understatement. This movie really lives up to the promises that have been made. Further more it is (in my opinion at least) the movie that stays most loyal to the book. I did miss some scenes from the book yet nothing relevant was left out. I don't want to give out any spoilers 'cause I don't want to ruin it for you but if you have read the book it will be very easy to follow and if not - well I think it still makes sense most of the time.

","While never an avid Harry Potter fan, I have watched all eight Harry Potter films on the big screen over the past decade. It's been a long, bumpy ride, with some films stronger than others - mainly the first few (in my own honest opinion). After a while, however, it all felt like the biggest cinematic tease ever. I mean, we've been told about Voldermort ever since the beginning, and we've known all along that the saga will end with this big, epic fight between good and evil... err, I mean Harry vs. Voldermort. However, that never came (except for a few teases here and there), and when the producers decided to postpone the inedible and split the last film into two, it became ever so frustrating.",/review/rw7169516/?ref_=tt_urv

Ever since the frothily juvenile but still undeniably good quality Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone first hit cinema screens in 2001, the Harry Potter saga has experienced countless crucial plot developments, more and more introductions of new characters and actors, several new directors and frequent changes of tone, all to give an astounding and vastly rewarding end result.
