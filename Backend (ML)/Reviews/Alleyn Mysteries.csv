25 November 2022,DunkelheitVZ,9," What is wrong with us humans?
","I needed to give this movie 9 stars out of 10, because it has such an important message. What are we doing with our world? Why do we let greed divide us? Why is it so important to wage war around every corner?",/review/rw8671986/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's a wonderful story sees two girls become women, when they're forced to up sticks from the place they've been living, as conflict and turmoil takes grip in their land, and democracy, freedom and liberties canned, fighting tides and head winds as they travel with others, who have similar tales of opportunities smothered, with hope and belief that the city of Berlin, will be their spring board, and allow them to swim.",/review/rw8671986/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2022,paul-allaer,7," Awe-inspiring if slightly overlong film based on true story
","As ""The Swimmers"" (2022 release from Turkey; 135 min) opens, we are in ""2011, a suburb of Damascus, Syria"", and we get to know sisters Yursa and Sara, whose father is also their swim coach. We then go to ""2015, Four Years Later"", and the civil war in Syria is destroying everything. Yursa and Sara, now 17 yo, decide to flee Syria, accompanied by their cousin. At this point we are less than 15 minutes in the movie.",/review/rw8671986/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2022,emperorsclothes,," I hated this film...
","..for how much it made me cry. A beautiful film. Well told. I'm sure there was a lot more heartache and joy in their journey, but this was phenomenal to be able to fit into the length of a feature.. and no buts, purely a fantastic film. Kudos to the director, editors, and everyone involved. I wish to know everyone's story from their particular journey. I know many have had to do this trip and many didn't make it. Inspiring. IMDB is making me write more, but I don't mind just repeating how great this film is. I look forward to seeing more films directed by Sally El Hosaini and writing by her as well.",/review/rw8671986/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2022,cathyannemoore-66196,10," It opened my eyes
","Started to watch this film without knowing anything about it, only that it was trending at number 3 on Netflix. I usually switch films off with subtitles but something about this one lured me in. The balance of spoken English and subtitles actually worked for me as the film is about people attempting to cross International borders not all of them speaking the same language.",/review/rw8671986/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2022,Blue-Grotto,8," Find your lane. Swim your race
","With bombs and soldiers swarming around their home in Damascus, sisters Yusra and Sara decide to flee to Europe in pursuit of a better life. As highly competitive swimmers the girls were training to compete in the Olympics. Now instead of swimming in a pool, Yusra and Sara are trying out the Mediterranean. Other obstacles threatening to pull them under include a broken-down raft overloaded with passengers, barbed wire fences, dogs, police, and criminals eager to profit from desperate refugees. Still, the greatest currents that they are swimming against are in themselves.",/review/rw8671986/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2022,bloemen-18050,8," The world needs movies like this, with messages like this
","This movie touched me deeply. The Swimmers is a story about humanity, perseverance, love and hope. About family. In the realest way. The fact that all of this happened is unbelievable, and the fact it happened and keeps happening so much (meaning war and refugees) is heartbreaking to me. In our western world we tend to forget. So I'm grateful for this movie to bring forward this message. Even more grateful to have done this in such a beautiful and respectful way. The script is amazing, the cinematography is amazing and so are the actors. This is my first IMBd review and I just had to write it.",/review/rw8671986/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2022,raveesh-shrivastava,10," truly a great story, must watch
","It's movie on a story about refugees something that the world has been ignoring from a long time. It's a tough subject to create such a movie and do justice to the autobiography of the swimmers. The movie has many emotional points, I found it inspiring and moving too as opposed to few reviews that said it's not inspiring. I didn't find it long as well. Just keep going on if you feel it's streching then skips 10 seconds but I am sure that won't be needed. Enjoy this movie and pray for peace and stability across the world. I wish more such movies are made so the world can watch and support the refugees.",/review/rw8671986/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2022,edwin-wks,8," Swim for those who died at sea...
","... trying to find a new life. Most of us reading this thankfully live in stable democracies in which the biggest concerns of our lives are inflation, rising interest rates and ever bigger mortgages. We do not really stop to consider others whose lives are upended or stymied by war, genocide and ruthless dictators. Some of us even cast a wary glance at refugees, asylum seekers and even ordinary migrants because they had the apparent audacity to seek a better life in our countries and take our jobs (even if these are jobs no one wanted in the first place, as the COVID-19 pandemic proved).",/review/rw8671986/?ref_=tt_urv

","... and then you swim? No pun intended obviously. I have to admit, I did not know the story of the two sisters. But they are also representing a lot more than just their own story. They are telling the story of migrants ... of people fleeing their country to find luck, to find a way of life ... a better way - a life in general. They also humanize what some politicians try to rationalize.",/review/rw8671986/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2022,masonfisk,8," WHOLLY INSPIRATIONAL...!
","A recent Netflix original. Based on a true story which tells the story of two Syrian sisters, Nathalie Issa & Manal Issa, who flee their country during the Syrian uprising in the hopes of getting to Germany where the younger of the two has prospects of being an Olympic swimming competitor. Leaving their family behind but accompanied by their cousin, Ahmed Malek, the trio make a grueling journey via boat, land (walking) & car to reach their promised land so Nathalie can fulfill her potential (Manal was also a swimmer but along the way gave it up) which comes in the form of meeting up w/a German swimming coach, Matthias Schweighofer (from Army of the Dead & its sequel) who gives Nathalie hope to join the refugee team to compete which leads to her showing in the 2016 Rio games. Never forgetting the narrative rises or falls on the relationship between the two sisters, the film is never anything less than engaging where every step forward invariably has several steps back during their tumultuous trek making it just as suspenseful (since we assume the ending will be a hopeful one) as any thriller on display.",/review/rw8671986/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2022,thereal-2,8," Larger than life true stories always win!
","Had the privilege to attend the European premier of the movie which will come to Netflix on 23rd of November. The movie is a very nicely paced dramatization of an amazing human achievement and story, it's amazing because of the nature how far they came along and its amazingly human because they've did it sheerly as human beings nothing more. You could even profanely say as ""superheroes"" to quote the movie directly. Nothing super fancy directing and editing here, just purely nice narration and sequencing of events dramatization and this is being done nicely by the director Sally El Hosaini. But the real magic and chemistry lies between the two lead actresses Manal and Nathalie Issa who are siblings in real life as well not just on the screen; this chemistry between them gives you the passionate punch which delivers effectively indeed. This movie is definitely an underdog testament, a very good one.",/review/rw8671986/?ref_=tt_urv

2 December 2022,samabc-31952,8," Well crafted, impressive parabolic visuals
","They count 30 million, Of which half is less than 18 years old. From all across the world with almost 1/4th of them from Syria. A saga of exodus. This movie is a remarkable true story of two of those refuges who like others would embark on the toughest longest journey. Well crafted, inspiring true story. Impressive parabolic visuals. The roof nightclub, neon lights, loud music and the fiery orange skyline due to streaming missiles creates a powerful allegory. Also, on the shoreline of Lesbos in Greece, a pile of abandoned lifejackets that covers an entire hill is symbolic to the number of refuges crossed Aegean Sea. Just from Syria alone, there were more than a million of people have fled in last 10 years since Arab Springs protests erupted.* Characterization is weak as defined within the frame of the situations and that is why at times lacks depth. Nathalie Issa delivers a strong performance. A great watch.",/review/rw8671986/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2022,A_Different_Drummer,8," ""Swim your race"" (dialog, father to daughter)
","Not your typical sports movie. And that is a good thing. As a stand-alone story about overcoming obstacles, it is well-crafted, well-acted, and holds the attention. But that is not the point. There is another entirely different level here. A western viewer cannot help but notice that this is a culture we seldom get to see, except maybe in distant headlines and sound-bites. The bizarre world we live in has made us all too immune to proxy wars, refugees, and rule by sociopaths. This movie, operating on this seldom-seen level, reminds us of that reality by presenting real characters with real hopes and dreams, caught up something that most westerners have never known. At least not yet, anyway. Recommended. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

3 January 2023,tarekali-19909,9," true story of 2 sisters and their indomitable will to survive and thrive
","A remarkable movie that documents the often ignored plight of migrants fleeing war zones and failed states. This is a true story of 2 sisters and their indomitable will to survive and thrive, for themselves, their dreams and their families. The horrors of the land and sea passage, at the mercy of predatory smugglers and coyotes, are accurately depicted here. There is a humanizing element, but a well-balanced portrayal of both sides of the coin, where these fleeing persons are treated with the milk of human kindness and the bitterness of inhuman cruelty.",/review/rw8671986/?ref_=tt_urv

24 November 2022,justinerogers,10," Great Movie
","I've watched it twice already and what a great job they did making this! Finally a perspective of the realities of Western negligence when it comes to asylum seekers. This movie is motivational, stressful, heart wrenching/ heart warming and the fact the real life women are now facing prosecution from Greece for aiding asylum seekers and are facing up to 20 years in prison is something that should be talked about and condemned widely. For more information on that situation you can check out free humanitarians on Instagram. The actors also deserve all the praise because they did an amazing job. Refugees/ Asylum seekers have been through some of the worst conditions and many don't make out alive. People fleeing unsafe conditions from non European countries are constantly neglected and it's time we have more movies like this amplifying the stories of these people. Great job to everyone involved in the making of this movie. 10/10 would definitely recommend!",/review/rw8671986/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2023,mrsatan79,7," I was lucky
","I did not know this story. It is very powerful and deserves to be told. I really enjoyed the performance of the Mardinis and I was glad to learn that they are sisters also in real life. Before watching it, you should consider that It is not an easy movie: a couple of times it is like a punch in the stomach. However I strongly recommend the vision. It is not easy to find a film on this subject that does not fall into stereotypes. The movie achieve its goal well and it helps you to exercise the empathy muscle.

13 November 2022,sacks-162-755605,10," powerful, gripping, beautifully done, compelling and important story
","Beautiful, deeply moving, and thought-provoking film. The dialogue and performances felt completely authentic. The story was compelling from start to finish. The subject matter is obviously rather awful and it was sometimes painful to watch the suffering of these characters who seemed so real (and in fact were real), yet there was also so much humor and grit and so many moments of unexpected joy that the film never felt bleak. As a lap swimmer (though not a good one), I felt that the director and cinematographer really captured how compelling swimming -- a sport that might seem dull from the outside -- can be. It would be easy for a film like this to be mawkish, or bleak, or overwhelming, or preachy, but it was none of these things. Wonderful film. I hope it wins heaps of oscars.",/review/rw8671986/?ref_=tt_urv
