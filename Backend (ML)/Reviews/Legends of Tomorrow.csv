13 March 2020,rooprect,7," Exciting flick. Leave your disbelief suspended at home.
","""Shooter"" is a tale about a patriot who gets used & abused by the government that he swore allegiance to. Even worse, they do nasty things to his dog. It's the kind of movie that makes you want to run off to Canada, not because you hate your country but because you hate the goons who are running it. But don't pack your hockey stick just yet because the story provides enough satisfying turns to keep things entertaining rather than depressing.",/review/rw1777559/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2007,DICK STEEL,8," A Nutshell Review: Shooter
","Never mess with someone who can drop you with his gun from miles away. Snipers somehow has this aura of mystique and sexiness associated with the motto of ""one shot, one kill"", as exhibited in movies like Enemy at the Gates, or memorable war characters such as in Saving Private Ryan. In Shooter, this gets demystified for a while, hitting home that not only should one be gifted with the pulling of the trigger from incredible distance, a sniper is also a master mathematician, having to compute the trajectory of the round with factors of humidity, wind direction, angle etc just to hit the target.",/review/rw1777559/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2007,Surecure,8," Recipe for a fantastic, intelligent action film
","If you were to take the best parts of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan series (Patriot Games, Clear And Present Danger, Sum of All Fears) and mixed in the best parts of the only good Rambo film (First Blood) you would end up with something akin to Shooter. Shooter is a smart, engaging and all out enjoyable action flick that never pulls its punches and always surprises you when you least expect it.",/review/rw1777559/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2007,thinker1691,8," "" This is Serious, . . . They Killed My Dog ""
","It has always been one of the great mistakes of militaries around the world, to recruit the best young men and train them to kill ruthlessly. Some become so proficient at their task, as to glean the admiration of ambitious and callous individuals who will then use these human weapons for any purpose necessary. For the film student, this scenario is not new, but has become a repeatable staple for movie directors whenever they need intrigue, drama and action. The list of films who's name resembles, "" Marksman, Sniper, Assassin, Killer, Agent, Mercenary, Machanic, Sanction or just plain Liquidator."" is as long as your arm. The only difference here is the title has been shorten to ""Shooter."" In this story our hero, Bob Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) is an Ex-Iraq era Marine sniper, now retired and reputed to be the very best at his art is once again recruited to serve his country. A very sincere military Officer, Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) convinces him to help protect the President of the United States. Convinced, Swagger details the 'where and how' to the Colonel and his men, only to discover, they are not what they appear and the Marine finds himself the target. On the run, he must now evade a nationwide manhunt, clear his name and find the truth behind the deception. Along the way, he discovers an ally in a rookie F.B.I. agent named Nick Memphis (Michael Peña) who also becomes a wanted fugitive. Based on the novel by Steven Hunter the fast action film includes notable Ned Beatty and Elias Koteas as Jack Payne. If you're looking for action, drama and a plausible movie for the times, you've found one. ****",/review/rw1777559/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2007,ThatMonkey,8," Still Invincible
","I was surprised in many ways by shooter. #1, I was surprised by the release. I follow movies and I didn't hear about this title until early this year. #2, I was amazed by Marks ability to sell me on his acting skills. #3, By the fact that the most established actors in this title, Ned and Danny may have given career killing performances. I think Tony Todd and Stephen Root would have been solid choices, but my guess is the two poor performances were bought for name recognition.",/review/rw1777559/?ref_=tt_urv

30 June 2007,ccthemovieman-1,5," The Good & Bad Of 'Shooter'
","THE GOOD - What a great start! The first half hour of this is outstanding and the first hour very good. It looks like, as advertised, that if you enjoyed the ""Bourne"" movies (""The Bourne Identity"" and ""The Bourne Supremacy"") you should like this and that was the case with me.....for the first hour. Mark Walhber's ""Bob Lee Swagger"" is a likable hero, a good guy in every sense. Yes, he's macho, intelligent, a thoughtful, patriotic guy, etc.. The scenes where he is eluding everyone in Philadelphia in what would be an impossible dragnet lack a little credibility but they sure are fun to watch.",/review/rw1777559/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2009,johnslegers,8," Entertaining action film with controversial viewpoints
","Although not accurate all the way, this film is one of the more realistic action thrillers I've seen. It's one of the few films where the main character actually spends a lot of time taking care of just two gun shot wounds (without vital organs being hit), one of the few films that puts governmental corruption in a more or less correct perspective, one of the few films where the lone hero needs a sidekick to help him with the planning, etc. On top of that, the film is entertaining from beginning to end and character motives are believable.",/review/rw1777559/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2007,thecrow22,10," Amazing
","I came into this film with loads of skepticism, but I came out feeling completely the opposite. Shooter takes you into the life of retired Marine Scout Sniper Bob Lee Swagger, who retired after a mission went completely wrong. He is called back to give information as to how someone would be able to kill the president from over a mile away. He ends up being framed for the attempted murder of the president, and the murder of an archbishop of Ethopia, and must prove his innocence, at any cost.",/review/rw1777559/?ref_=tt_urv

23 March 2007,jpanyard,8," Wahlberg may be next Bruce Willis
","Mark Wahlberg might be the Bruce Willis of the new generation. His taciturn Bobby Swagger is perfect. The action is basically nonstop and very gritty. Bobby is a sniper who has retired to the mountains after being screwed by the government in an event which finds his sidekick dead. After being set up, he is stone cold killer. Think Jason Bourne as someone who remembers his past is really p.o.'d about it. The acting is good all around, with Glover and Beatty as bad guys you love to hate. Underlying all this a morality tale about what this country and its government have become. Many situations, of course, stretch the imagination , but watching a sense of honor prevail, no matter how briefly, is worth the price of admission. No Oscar nominations here, but a big bundle of money for the producers will be no surprise.",/review/rw1777559/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2008,claudio_carvalho,7," It Is About Freedom, It Is not About Oil
","In Ethiopia, in the end of a secret mission, the sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) and his friend and spotter Donnie Fenn (Lane Garrison) are betrayed, left behind and Donnie is killed. Three years later, the lonely Bob is living in the mountains of Wyoming with his beloved dog Sam when he unexpectedly visited by Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover). The colonel uses Bob's patriotism to invite him to work in the security of the President of USA, trying to foresee where a sniper could shot him along his visit to Washington, Philadelphia and Seattle with the Archbishop of Ethiopia. When the Archbishop is deadly shot in Philadelphia, Bob is double-crossed and also shot twice by Officer Stanley Timmons (Alan C. Peterson) and accused of the murder. Wounded and chased by dozens of agents and policemen, Bob seeks help with the only person that could believe him, and while seeking the real killer, he finds a huge conspiracy related to oil supply.",/review/rw1777559/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2007,StevenAWebb,8," Engaging, worth seeing.
","I had the opportunity to catch an advance screening of this film the other day. Similarities to other projects aside, I was impressed by the use of some of the newer military technology involved. The film was both engaging and entertaining, and Mark Wahlberg did a very good job of portraying the character in all of his idiosyncrasies. It was good to see Danny Glover again as I have not had the opportunity to see him in any films of late. His character was not exactly multidimensional but I would assume that it was what the writing called for, and certainly different from the one he portrays in the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, not much comedy here. Now if I could only get a hold of the script... Needless to say, my wife and I enjoyed the movie very much and would definitely recommend to go and see it.",/review/rw1777559/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2011,chris-976-332846,10," Surprisingly Good!
","I watched this film, expecting to be let down. However it really did tick most of the boxes for me. I found it engaging and entertaining all the way through, for me a film where you want to watch through to the end because you WANT to watch, not out of a masochistic urge to ""find out what happens"". Mark Wahlbergs performance was top notch. Although there are a few ""no chance"" moments in the film as there always are with these type of films, the majority of it was for me within the realms of possibility. The soundtrack was also excellent and melded well with the action on screen. Both myself and my Fiancée enjoyed this film greatly. I can't really think of any negatives for this film and can only recommend it.",/review/rw1777559/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2014,classicsoncall,8," ""I don't think you understand. These boys killed my dog.""
","Except for the idea that former Marine sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) and FBI detective Nick Memphis (Michael Pena) could blow up an elite team of twenty four assassins and go on to decimate a mountain cabin with a U.S. Senator (Ned Beatty), I thought this was a pretty effective thriller. The set up with the hiring of Swagger for his expertise in sniper tactics was convincingly done, and with the kind of skill required for such long distance marksmanship, it makes me wonder when a real life attack like the one depicted in the film might some day be attempted.",/review/rw1777559/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2007,the-movie-guy,10," Shooter puts you in the shoes of a sniper
","(My Synopsis) Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg), a former Marine scout sniper who had the ability to hit a target from a mile away, leaves the Corps after a mission goes terribly wrong. Swagger has become a cynical American Marine who believes that he was betrayed by his country. What Swagger didn't know was that he was on a secret mission working for a black-ops government organization with their own agenda about what America really needs. Swagger is contacted by retired Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover), who tells him that his country needs his special knowledge and expert skills as a sniper to stop an assassination attempt on the President. Swagger doesn't want to work for these guys,but his patriotism for his country makes him do it. Unfortunately, for Swagger this is the same black-ops group that left him for dead before. And as usual, they set him up and double-cross him again. Now the whole country thinks he was the one who tried to kill the President. To prove his innocence, Swagger must find these people and learn the truth and take out his own revenge. ",/review/rw1777559/?ref_=tt_urv

Cut to 3 years later, and Marky Mark is set up in a ranch in the snowy mountains in a remote location, sporting an awful haircut, and owning perhaps the best dog in the world.

24 March 2007,Miss_Jena,8," Wahlberg is a modern day McGuyver... but better looking.
","finally, a movie in theaters WORTH seeing!!!! i just saw ""Shooter"" and i was thoroughly entertained. the plot kept me intrigued from beginning to end. mark wahlberg is fantastic... he's like a modern day McGuyver, but better looking and more sarcastic. his character is cunning and smart. wahlberg excels in playing characters who are determined to make an impact. i'm not a huge fan of action movies, but this movie was so packed with plot that i just kept moving along with it. i bet most of the naysayers of the film are going to be people who believe every word their government tells them. yes, this film depicts government officials in a bad light, but what or who doesn't? i'm sure in reality it's much worse. don't let political beliefs interfer with seeing this film... it's a good time no matter what side you are on. the screenplay was well-written, excluding ONE, minute one-liner about anna nicole smith marrying for love which was obviously written before her death. (plus the story takes place in 1997 anyway!!) other than that detail, viewers should have no complaints with this film. it's intense but not overbearing. easy to follow but complex. and you'll be impressed with wahlberg's character... go see for yourself!!",/review/rw1777559/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2007,jaredmobarak,6," I'm gonna see it throughShooter
","Director Antoine Fuqua has a style and filmography that I have enjoyed in the past. With Training Day and King Arthur, he delivered some action packed movies that had both story and popcorn pyrotechnics. I will say that after seeing the trailer for his new film Shooter, I was a bit underwhelmed, but until I went to one of his works and was not entertained, I would at least give it a shot. I'm glad I did as Shooter ended up being a well told, nicely paced actioner that knew what it wanted to do at all times and lived up to its goals. We are never led into a situation that may twist in a way that will bring us out of the reality of what is happening; our hero has been framed and he will do anything necessary to find justice. Fuqua tells us who the good guys and who the bad guys are at all times. There is never an opportunity for the audience to second guess someone's motives because the filmmaker is willing to appreciate our intelligence and spin a linear tale of revenge, trying to set things right against a corrupt government.",/review/rw1777559/?ref_=tt_urv

Three men from the Government roll up one day, saying that they need Swagger's expertise to help work out where a long range threat to the president's life could possibly come from  something intel says is going to happen in the next few weeks.
