16 January 2023,jonathancley,8," Refreshing, engaging, fantastic acting and cast. . .Would be given a 9 if English subtitles were easier to read
",I read Cixin Liu's series a couple of times in 2019 and 2020 and was blown away. . .so excited this show finally came out after the release date kept on getting delayed.,/review/rw8806524/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2023,yooniverse,8," Surprisingly faithful to book
","Ten episodes in, it has surprised me with how faithful the show has been to the book. Sure, some scenes are out of sequence and a few characters have been added to aid in conveying parts of the story that characters internalize in the book, and a few changes to presumably to satisfy the politicos, but it's otherwise as written. I find it rare to adapt a show this tightly to source material.",/review/rw8806524/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,seanyliu,8," Keep an open mind
","One difficulty of book adaptations is it will never play out perfectly as it would in each reader's mind. Of course the show won't live up to the masterpiece that is Three Body Problem. That kind of scifi epic only happens ever so often; one's that can be adapted to a show even rarer. However, the show stays true to ""show, don't tell"", and despite some negligible flawed, eager ensemble acting, as well as a few examples of over-exaggerated editing here and there, it incorporates much of the content from the books while adding much non-cgi visually impressive elements to enrich the shows format as a visual medium. One aspect I especially enjoyed was the main cast. The casting for major characters also reflects the books surprisingly well, and the acting of major characters deserve to be applauded.",/review/rw8806524/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,filipehattori,8," Groundbreaking SciFi. Held back by poor pacing.
","Based on the first 8 episodes, this is a non-spoiler short review.",/review/rw8806524/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,dmoreyn,10," something special
","This is a pretty intellectual series. I'm no genius, but I kept up with the dialogue and learned some very intriguing alternate concepts about our reality. It's target audience, I think, is the thinking man, and it is a beautifully done show. Can't ever really recall seeing something quite like it. You should watch it if you want something that challenges your mind, and simply relaxing and watching tv isn't your primary goal today. In addition, it feels like an easy watch, without any tedium to make you wish you could fast forward through parts of it. Definitely worth a viewing if only for the novelty of the story and how it encourages you to expand your mental horizons.",/review/rw8806524/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,qwcfsqyj,9," Authentic to the original novel, and nice casting
","The casting is great and really fits my imagination when I read the novel (except that Shi Qiang needs to be a little more muscular). The story was beyond imagination, really epic, and it's not about one single country or one single culture, you can see every nation, every race united together when facing danger. The TV series tried to make everything the same as the book. One star was deducted because the pacing of story telling, all the flashbacks and neon lights scenes are a bit annoying and confusing, when not everyone knows the background of the story. Although the novel itself was arranged in this way, I think there should be some adaptations when you making it a TV series.",/review/rw8806524/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,sijieyangyang,9," A good match to the original story
","My verdict is that this drama follows the original very closely and is basically the original words from it, so it's great to watch. The visual presentation is excellent throughout and is a work that is very respectful of the original.",/review/rw8806524/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2023,duanxiaohang,10," Wonderful
","This three-body movie, whether it is a mirror or a Tao, is particularly close to the original book. Some people say it is chaotic, but this is the beauty of chaos that Liu Cixin wants to present in the original book. In the face of the unprecedented physical disasters and visions brought by extraterrestrial civilization, Wang Miao's fear and sense of the unknown are vividly expressed with fast and constantly flashing scenes. The soundtrack of the ending English song has a sense of empty inspiration and decadence, which also reflects the decadence in the minds of scientists. I think there is no problem with the soundtrack of the film. The sense of substitution is very strong. It is a three-body film and television work that exceeds expectations.",/review/rw8806524/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,p-46670,10," This is the three body I want! excited
","Not only did I shoot the three body in my imagination, but also the original plot was very moving, such as the fifth episode. In addition, the original plot is obviously to attract the interest of people who have not read the original.",/review/rw8806524/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2023,notany,7," Surprisingly faithful adaption to already classic sci-fi book with questionable narrative choisces.
",The three-Body book series is high-concept sci-fi and already a classic. It's hard sci-fi with little speculative physics added.,/review/rw8806524/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2023,qugaoming,9," Be faithful to the original
","Loyal to the original work, restored most of the content, and made a small part of changes aimed at film and television. Except for the segment of the unscrupulous reporter, which is disappointing, other segments are very pleasant. In particular, the part about Hong'an Base starts from the original work and is higher than the original work. Even those who have not read the book ""Three Bodies"" can easily understand the plot with a little scientific literacy and curiosity. This film and television work may be an opportunity for you to understand ""Three Bodies"", Liu Cixin and science fiction works. It is very good to compare the animation of the Bili Bili version.",/review/rw8806524/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,doublebeatricecn,8," I really look down on those who make inferences about guilt.
","Obviously, the series with a good sense still needs to be scolded by the sour people. What is the level of drama to satisfy the audience in China? Personally, I think this series is the essence of Three Body Problem. Maybe the animated version disappoints me too much. Since the play has a length of 30 episodes, I can't make a conclusion. But I still want to say that I'm looking forward to the future development. The Three-body Problem is really great. Three ""Three Body Problems"" will be released this year, and the animated version is dead. I don't know if this and Netflix version can become classics.",/review/rw8806524/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2023,scottmannen1,," For Those Who Never Read the Book
",What in the heck am I watching? I understand that all you folks giving it high numbers and praise completely follow the tv show because you completely followed the books.,/review/rw8806524/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,zorro6204,4," Totally amateur hour, yet weird enough to watch
","This thing is just flat out bizarre, I won't even bother to explain the plot, not sure I can. It's so Dramatic and Important, as the endless exposition assures us, countless subtitles, eye straining to watch. The acting is overblown and unprofessional, and the influence of CCP censoring bewildering. And yet, it is entertaining, if one has the energy to pay attention. I guess I'm glad I've watched (so far), not sure I would recommend anyone else do so. Give episode one a shot, if you turn it off half way through, totally understandable. If you get through that with any kind of curiosity for what follows, okay, I get that too. But in no sense can you say this is a good TV production, that would purely be a fan boy sentiment.",/review/rw8806524/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2023,SpaceIce,5," False Advertisement !
","I have not not read the book, and have watched almost half of the Season 1 (12 Episodes) and there is no aliens or invasion.",/review/rw8806524/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2023,mnp1975,2," Not worth the time
","Wow, what a mess. A combo of ADHD cinematography & mindless editing and endless segments of exposition dialogue, topped with cheesy effects. Oh, and the narration skips key elements of the plot, leading to barely no tension at all being built - stuff just happens.",/review/rw8806524/?ref_=tt_urv
