17 June 2003,Danny_G13,," Intriguing story
","Secretary is the first of its kind - a very dark love story. First of its kind in that it deals with themes never seen before seen in mainstream Hollywood cinema - S&M, sexual dominance and submission.",/review/rw0789258/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2004,Infofreak,," The most original romantic comedy I've seen in YEARS! Highly recommended.
","I may be a jaded old cynic but from time to time a contemporary movie knocks me off my seat. Recently there's been quite a few -'May', 'Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance' and 'Auto Focus' immediately spring to mind. 'Secretary' is another recent gem. This is the most original romantic comedy (very black, mind you) I've seen in YEARS! And for something which deals with a lifestyle alien to me (dominance and submission) it's surprisingly touching, and even managed to get me to shed a tear or two. I had previously enjoyed Maggie Gyllenhaal's supporting roles in 'Donnie Darko' and John Waters' 'Cecil B. Demented' (she played Raven, the make up artist - ""Pain is pleasure! Slavery is freedom! Suicide for Satan!' remember?), but her performance here is first class and is guaranteed to turn her into a major cult figure if not an actual genuine STAR. I confess that I now have a major crush on her to boot (I'm sure I'm not alone!). James Spader is also very, very good. While I admired him appearing in Cronenberg's 'Crash' a few years ago most of his other film choices have been safe ones and to be honest I'd pretty much given up on him as an actor. But it just goes to show what an actor is capable of with an innovative script and a supportive director. It's really difficult imagining any other two actors playing these roles any better. In the supporting cast Jeremy Davies also surprised me. I'd been getting a bit tired of his crazy shtick in previous roles, especially his extremely irritating performance in 'The Million Dollar Hotel', but he did a much more subtle job in this movie, and it really worked for me. This is my first experience with director Steven Shainberg but I was impressed. I now want to try and see his previous movie, the Jim Thompson adaptation 'Hit Me'. I also look forward to his next movie, because if 'Secretary' is any indication of his talent then he's sure to come up with something very special. Highly recommend.",/review/rw0789258/?ref_=tt_urv

22 September 2002,lawprof,8," Not Your Typical Office Romance
","Maggie Gyllenhaal deserves an Oscar nomination for her brilliant portrayal of borderline psychotic, self-mutilating Lee Holloway, a former mental institution patient seeking to sustain herself - vocationally and emotionally - in a challenging world where she has few safe harbors.

17 April 2004,rbverhoef,8," Very original
","'Secretary' deals with a daring and original subject and does this in an effective and funny way. Its subject is sadomasochism, its genre is a romantic comedy. The secretary is Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who suffers from self-mutilation, her boss is Mr. Grey (James Spader), who seems the coldest man alive. When they are in the same room you feel that there is something there, they both feel it too. Since the movie opens with a certain S/M scene we already know that there is a point in the movie where the two must find each other and start the sadomasochism activities. I will not reveal how and when it happens, but the moment is great.",/review/rw0789258/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2003,kmberger,8," Thoughtful and yes, sentimental.
","Those Gyllenhalls, they sure can act.  Maggie, like her brother Jake, turns in great performances like they're routine - she makes it look easy.  In 'Secretary', she delivers a layered, complex performance as Lee Holloway, a disturbed young lady who deals with stress by cutting herself - the pain pushes away everything else that's bothering her.",/review/rw0789258/?ref_=tt_urv

","The word ""originality"" has been overused, especially by me, so much that it has almost been beaten to a pulp.  After all, how can one really tell if something in a film hasn't been done before?  Well, I can confidently say that Steven Shainberg's ""Secretary"" may be the most inventive, and yes, even original, film this year.  I can confidently say that in all of my time of watching and reviewing films, I have never seen anything like it.",/review/rw0789258/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2003,stephenksmith,," a dark comedy layered with nuanced social and personal commentary
","What is the path to love?  For every person, it's different.  The superficial circumstances are similar... you meet someone at work, at school, in a singles bar.  And, usually, the emotional pathways are similar. Eyes meet.  We talk.  We dance.  We communicate about ourselves to each other.  Then begins the sexual part, so we parry and thrust, take signals from each other, and, over time, we feel each other up together.  But what about the path to love through the back door (so to speak)?  What about a love story where she's a young, neurotic woman, just out of a mental hospital back to a family where Dad's a serious drunk and Mom's a serious nervous fruitcake.  And what about a man, an attorney, who's emotionally closed off and can only get in touch with orchids, inserting long stainless-steel tools into their waiting organs.  Yes, these two find each other in one of the most bizarre cinematic love stories ever. ",/review/rw0789258/?ref_=tt_urv

","This one was really a pleasant surprise. I was expecting a black comedy as well as a movie that deals with kinky fetishes. It's both of those things but, surprisingly, it's also a very nice and sweet love story. Yes, really. Maggie Gyllenhaal is wonderful. I think this is easily my favorite role of hers. She's funny, adorable, and sexy. James Spader's great but Maggie really makes the movie something special.",/review/rw0789258/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2004,The_Void,8," More tease than strip
","In this romantic black comedy, Maggie Gyllenhaal stars as Lee Holloway, the lady worker of the title. As you probably already know, this secretary doesn't just push pens and use paper clips, she has another, more exciting capacity as her boss's love object. The film actually isn't quite as naughty as many people think it thinks it is, but the truth is that the sadomasochistic area of the film isn't really all that important. The film isn't really about obscure sexual preferences, it's about finding someone whom you are comfortable with and the S&M is just a means to an end. The sex aspect of the film does serve a purpose, however, in that it's that which makes the film a social satire of this culture of flirting in the office; a very over the top one, that is, and one that gives the film it's shock value; but to be honest, you don't really get to see that much bondage. The film is very original in it's portrayal of S&M however, as it's a very taboo subject and for it to be portrayed in a sweet and upbeat manner like this is welcome and very different.",/review/rw0789258/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2005,evanston_dad,8," I'd Like That Coffee with a Spanking, Please
","""Secretary"" is a deliciously off-beat dramedy about an emotionally disturbed young girl (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who gets a job as a you know what for an attorney with his own set of personal problems (James Spader). Soon, she's doing more than typing for him, and he's helping her come out of her reclusive shell. This film on paper sounds almost exactly like ""The Piano."" A young woman is given the choice between a conventional relationship and one that superficially might seem perverse, and opts for the perverse one. In both films, what no-one in the heroine's sphere understands is that the man she's involved with is appealing because he's the only one who seems to understand what she needs.",/review/rw0789258/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2004,claudio_carvalho,8," When a Masochist Meets a Sadistic  An Unconventional Love Story
","Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a self-destructive and submissive woman, with suicide tendencies, who has just left a sanatorium after a breakdown. She has a kind of kit in a box for self-inflicting pain when she feels in trouble. Lee decides to get a typing course and when she finishes it, she decides to look for a job of secretary. She finds an advertisement in the newspaper, goes to an office, and the lawyer E. Edward Grey (James Spader) hires her. The details is that Edward is sadistic and a very dominating man, who humiliates Lee most of the time. Of course they will fall in love for each other, after many funny situations. This low budget movie is a wonderful unconventional romantic comedy, one of the weirdest I have ever seen, supported by excellent lead actor and actress and an original screenplay. The always-excellent James Spader is one of my favorite actors, and Maggie Gyllenhaal gives also an extraordinary performance in this film. The situations that Lee uses to tease Edward are hilarious. My vote is eight.",/review/rw0789258/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2003,TxMike,," Many will not like SECRETARY, but a good film for those with an open mind.
","Maggie Gyllenhaal stars as Lee Holloway, a 25-year old who has recently been released from an institution. She has some self-esteem problems, but turns out to be a very good typist and looks for a job. She stumbles upon a lawyer, Mr. Grey,42, played by James Spader, who just happens to need a new secretary. Lee comes in as the former secretary leaves. The fact that Mr Grey has a permanent lighted sign outside, ""secretary needed"", which can be turned off like a motel vacancy sign, tells us a lot about him right away. The whole film is a dark comedy, which explores alternate lifestyles, and as the director says, is Lee's coming of age, from darkness to light. At first I was leery about Spader's character, because it seemed he might be dangerous. He isn't, and as it turns out in a strange sort of way, he is helpful to Lee.",/review/rw0789258/?ref_=tt_urv

","I do not like SM, Maggie Gyllenhaal I never liked and comparing this to ""50 Shades of Grey"" was a complete deal breaker. But finally, I decided to see it because of James Spider. I like him a lot. And now I'm sorry that I did not see this movie back in 2002. because then I could use the past 15 years to see it a dozen more times. This movie is unbelievable. It is based on SM relationship, but it is more about love and determination to fight for what you really want. Spider is good as always, but Maggie was a real surprise. I never saw her this way before. Beautiful, sweet and good actress. I underestimated her unfairly. And the music was done by Angelo Badalamenti, author of legendary ""Twin Peaks"" soundtrack. Movie hypnotized me completely and two hours was not long enough. I was horny, crying and laughing all at the same time. I cannot recall any other movie ever had such effect on me. It blew my mind.

10 July 2014,Tweekums,9," A romantic comedy with a difference
",Protagonist Lee Holloway has recently been released from a mental hospital but she still hasn't got over her compulsion to self-harm; she goes on a secretarial course and gets a job with lawyer Edward Grey. He seems a little bit old fashioned; insisting that Lee uses a type writer for all his letters then he starts to chastise her for her occasional typing error. She strives to do her best but he keeps finding faults then one day he calls her into his office and instructs her to bend over his desk and read what she typed while doing this he starts smacking her bottom. She is surprised but rather than complaining about assault or sexual harassment she realises she actually likes it. So begins a relationship where she is totally subservient but nothing really sexual occurs and when it finally does it looks as if their unusual relationship is over. All the while she is 'sort of dating' Peter; a fair more conventional man; he loves her but he doesn't excite her; in the end will she go for what she truly wants or be ordinary?,/review/rw0789258/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8," Well-produced, and a respectful and fair representation of something widely considered to not be usual
","I know, that isn't exactly something that one comes by every day. If you don't look closely enough, this might appear to be little more than a plea for accepting those who don't follow the typical norms(an aspect that this does have, but it's not the focus), which wouldn't be outright bad, it would just not be as noteworthy as this is. Heck, some might expect this to be mere thinly veiled erotica. That couldn't be farther from the truth. This is about love, intimacy and discovering one's identity. While it is arguably provocative, and it was an intentional decision, that isn't at all the point of it. This is an empowering film, and it's rather well-made, as well. The plot is engaging, and interesting throughout. Every acting performance is spot-on, Spader is excellent and Gyllenhaal is absolutely flawless, bringing these credible, well-developed and human characters to the screen. The script is marvelous. Pacing is well-balanced, this never loses you. The humor is great, very funny, dark, occasionally sardonic. Dialog is well-written and impeccably delivered. Editing and cinematography are skillful. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer, B-Roll(or, in this case: behind-the-scenes) footage and about half an hour total of interviews with the two stars(showing that Maggie *really* understood what it was all about) and director Steven Shainberg(who also leaves no doubt as to the fact that he knew exactly what he was doing; I am most definitely going to seek out future movies by him). There is moderately frequent sexuality, a little nudity(for details, consult the Parental Guide), occasional strong language, as well as disturbing content(the amount, I suppose, depends on each individual audience member's personal tastes and boundaries). Maybe not for everyone, though I hope many will watch it. A courageous exploration of romance. I can see why the studios balked; long live independent cinema! I recommend this to anyone intrigued by the concept. 8/10",/review/rw0789258/?ref_=tt_urv

","How refreshing!!  It has been quite some time since I went to the movies and walked out feeling I could wholeheartedly endorse the film I just saw.  When asked why this film was so good by my coworkers, I responded ""the actors' performances, the sets, the script, the content, essentially everything.""  And so it is, everything. Thank the spirits that flow someone still has the ability, honesty, and energy to make such a film in the land of fakery and deception. While the relationship depicted is that of a sadist and a masochist and this is what will get played up in the press, the point is the relationship and the near impossibility of love working without complete honesty.

2 November 2002,u2rave,10," Quirky, fun, and everything I ever wanted in a film!
","""Secretary"" is everything I have ever wanted in a film: romance, humor, drama, and kinky sex! The incredible chemistry between an amazing Maggie Gyllenhaal and a repressed yet fierce James Spader is what makes this movie work so well, and the tender depths to which their relationship is portrayed makes it so much more than just a film about sadomasochism. I felt that the main theme of the film was to show that people have pain, and it is only when you accept that pain that you are able to feel your emotions fully, therefore making your life much more livable. This movie was a bit quirky, and might not be for everyone. However, I would recommend it to anyone with an open mind.
