20 December 2014,TheLittleSongbird,7," A good if very flawed conclusion to an entertaining if very problematic trilogy
","Sure, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is not going to please die-hard fans of the book (as evident in the reviews here), mainly because of it being the case of three 2 1/2- 3 hour films based on a 300+ book, and it is not a patch on the brilliant Lord of the Rings trilogy. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies has several major problems, mostly similar problems to the previous two films An Unexpected Journey and Desolation of Smaug but more serious for some, but it also like the previous two have a lot of good even great elements too. Judging the trilogy on its own terms without comparison, I still see as a majorly flawed but entertaining trilogy of films.",/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,CubsandCulture,8," I'm not sure why this one takes the most flak.
","I think this film goes a long way to explain why Jackson and company decided to split the novel into (at least) 2 films. The material after Smaug's death is grim, especially compared to the rest of it. And given the 3 key character deaths it makes sense that you would want to isolate this section and flesh it out. This is especially true if you are an action filmmaker. Character deaths should have dramatic meaning beyond whatever linguistic obsession Tolkien had. A character we have come to know going mad needs time to breath.",/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2014,Movie_Muse_Reviews,8," It's still not ""Lord of the Rings,"" but this is a fitting conclusion for a perfectly good fantasy trilogy
","Did Peter Jackson really just conclude his second Middle Earth trilogy? His take on J.R.R. Tolkein's ""The Lord of the Rings"" was a completely exhausting adventure that in many ways feels like seven films, not three, while ""The Hobbit"" trilogy feels exactly like it is on paper: one straightforward adventure broken into three parts. ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" proves a fitting, exciting conclusion to this particular trilogy, but compared to the conclusion of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" quite frankly and pun intended – it gets dwarfed.",/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2017,Platypuschow,9," The Hobbit The Battle of the Five Armies: Despite being the most poorly received it stands as my favorite
","I was distinctly underwhelmed by the first two Hobbit movies, I thought they were good but just that ""Good"". They live in the shadow of the Lord Of The Rings movies and simply paled in comparison and so going into The Battle Of The Five Armies I expected more of the same.",/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2022,griffithxjohnson,9," Fan service with heart
",Overboard at times but so much fan service. It doesn't loose its heart during the prolonged battle. Gorgeous beyond belief with an emotional conclusion. Undeniably a Middle-Earth love letter.,/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2014,Hitchcoc,7," A Bit Weak at the End
","I really enjoyed the first two. I don't buy into the criticism that a 300 page book couldn't be made into a full blown trilogy. That said, I found the last episode way too full of battle scenes and gratuitous violence, big armies banging into each other, terrible orcs riding wolves, and the ultimate confrontation. In the process, all the charm that had been built up in the first two movies seemed to be dropped for a bunch of special effects. It starts well with the appearance of Smaug who fulfills his promise of destroying the town. But after that its a hodge-podge of romance and revenge and ultimately death. As this one ended, I literally felt, ""Oh, is that the end?"" Having read ""The Hobbit"" a couple of times, I knew what was going to happen, but it didn't quite work the way I thought it would. There was just something empty. Don't get me wrong, I could revel in the effort, but I can't say that this will stay with me for a long time.",/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2022,kylebrown0209,8," Happy ending and awesome to a trilogy
",Well I have to say the 3rd and final Film Was awesome and great and there was a ton of action I need a And this is a worthy ending to a great story And I think that This is the ending that was earned I will definitely say that it was worth it And I also think That anyone who is anyone who read the Is novel will be happy I know I am There were times in this movie where I thought wow I thought wow the action was great And the CGI still holds up to this day Even now This Film is a few years old And I will definitely say I can't wait to check out Lord of the Rings My favorite part was the ending!!!!!!!,/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2022,raj-bhullar,7," Not as good as first two, but still decent
",Ok the first two movies are great adventure flicks and I rated them 10. I absolutely loved them. But this movie bored me a little bit. Almost the whole movie is a battle. It's also very predictable. Battle scenes are cheesy as hell. But it's still entertaining. Special effects look good. Pacing is a bit slow. Some scenes bored me. Also I didn't like that Thorin died. I wanted to see him conquer that mountain and live. He was a good leader but he was acting stupid under the dragon spell. Those scenes were annoying. Otherwise still a good watch. 7.3/10.,/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv

4 November 2017,sir_brettley,6," Not that great...and it doesn't age well
","The conclusion of the book is pretty satisfying. The movie, not so much. One of the things I hate about ""modern"" movies is the way that game scenes are built into the movie. It's obvious which ones will be part of games and it detracts from the film.",/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2014,prospectus_capricornium,9," A Fitting Tribute to JRR Tolkien's Middle Earth
","'The Hobbit: Battle of Five Armies"" roars with an electrifying opening sequence depicting Smaug setting Laketown ablazed in an apocalyptic fire. Right there, Jackson's mastery of visual spectacle is already screaming, but as the events unfold, the script starts losing track. In the wake of its phenomenal visual achievement, 'The Battle of Five Armies' fails to deliver its narrative as powerfullly as it should be. There are more than enough moments when weak dialogues and one liners fall beneath the overwhelming action-packed CGI-rendered sequences.",/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2015,bob the moo,," Fairly consistent action carries it along, even if there is little to it and even impacting moments are lessened by the relentlessness
","Perhaps it is me getting older but I do wonder if I was too kind on the original Lord of the Rings films in light of how disappointed I had been with the Hobbit films. Maybe because it was all new and different, or maybe they were genuinely better films than these. Anyway, as the Company continues their mission, so too did I return for the conclusion of this trilogy; although it must be said that I did not rush to it or have a great deal of excitement. The cliff- hanger from the previous film did win me over though, plus I wanted to see it through.",/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv

31 October 2018,cricketbat,5," The weakest of all Peter Jackson's Tolkien adaptations
","The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the weakest of all Peter Jackson's Tolkien adaptations. Even though this is the shortest of the Middle-earth movies, the story drags on as if it were the longest. But I guess that's what you get when you stretch out one book into three movies. In addition, the battle scenes are so computer generated that they look like in-game cinematics. It's a shame that this film series had to end on this note.",/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2014,MennoMan,9," Nice finish to an Over Extended Film
","It is without question The Hobbit did not need to be made into a three part film series... After all, given the book size of the Hobbit Compared to The Lord of the Rings... The Hobbit Should have been workable into one extended Movie or two at the most. If Jackson would have sun the story of The Lord of the Rings like he did the Hobbit, We would still be waiting for the last two movies in his twelve part series...",/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv

17 December 2014,abisio,8," Very good but not LOTR The Return of the King
",The third part of the Hobbit (The Battle of the Five Armies) it just takes a few pages of the Hobbit book. When you consider that the full book is about 150 pages and you can read it in 3 or four hours; it is difficult to understand how can Jackson made 7.5 hours trilogy (about 9 on the extended cut). Well basically adding characters and secondary events to the main story. Was that good ? It was not bad; but a little less could have been better.,/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2017,siderite,6," A clumsy ending
","The Battle of the Five Armies title is a great exaggeration of what an army entails. The movie is about more or less a skirmish with some rather imaginative weaponry. The plot goes sideways and after two three hours long previous films we get a two hours and a half mess that is half completely over the top battle scenes and the other half people talking out of their asses. It is pure chaos, where orcs are either mighty unbeatable beasts bred for war or cardboard armor wearing morons easily defeated by fishermen's wives and children, as the action demands. Things start to remind of Pirates of the Caribbean, and not only because it's the same actor doing kind of the same stuff.",/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2014,LeDentalPlaque,10," Great Ending to the Middle-Earth Saga
","The Lord of the Rings trilogy was one of the best film series ever to be made in terms of its epic proportions, grandiose score, intricate weaving of stories, and CGI. Peter Jackson did a great job interpreting the three Tolkien novels and putting them up on the big screen, a great feat done with great success.",/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2014,Quinoa1984,6," adequate but dull, punctured by heart and awe
","Peter Jackson loves his excess. The man can't get enough - as not even a storyteller but as a spectacle-producer, a showman, he is like a starving kid at a Thanksgiving day buffet. This series is an indication of that, even if it's not all of his fault (it was originally two movies, maybe too much enough, until the Tolkien estate said it needed to be three movies - the studios, I'm sure, concurred). He and his team take what is essentially a children's book (The Hobbit, that is, which Tolkien wrote for his children initially years before LOTR) and make it into a 474 minute trilogy (credit time included), which means that a character like Bilbo Baggins, the little Hobbit-that-could who finds that he can be courageous and has the 'Right Stuff' as it were on an adventure, is a bit diminished in the epic scope and grandeur of what is really, in this case, about the dwarf Thorin Oakenshield and his quest to retake the castle of his father from the dragon, Smaug.",/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2020,willsandy,8," An underrated finale to the Hobbit Trilogy
","As someone who grew up as a big fan of the book, as well as the LOTR films, I was sceptical when it was announced the 300ish page book would be stretched into three (very long) films. However, I feel like I'm in the minority here as I really enjoy this trilogy and by extension, this film.",/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2016,brando647,6," Peter Jackson's Epic Six-Movie Tolkien Series Ends with a Disinterested Shrug
","Finally, Bilbo Baggins returns to the Shire. After three bloated movies originating from around 300 pages of content, we've reached the end and I'm so glad to be done with it all. After a total of six movies set in Peter Jackson's Middle Earth, I'm totally fine with never hearing the word Hobbit again. His HOBBIT series concludes with the grand finale, THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES. When we last saw Bilbo (Martin Freeman), Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), and their company of dwarven companions, they had been left to gape helplessly as the dragon Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) got tired of chasing them through the mountain kingdom of Erebor and took to the skies to burn neighboring Laketown to cinders. This movie rejoins the action at that very moment, abandoning the dwarfs to focus on Smaug and local hero Bard (Luke Evans), who chooses to engage the dragon. Ten or so minutes later, the whole dragon plot that kept us trudging to the theater for these movies is resolved and we spend the next three hours on the titular battle. You see, Thorin immediately begins to succumb to what the dwarfs call ""dragon-sickness"" and what us normal folk would call ""greed"". He's got his rightful kingdom back with more gold than he could ever need, and now he refuses to share it with anyone. The men of Laketown, led by Bard, come knocking in hopes of at least getting some gold for their dwarven-caused dragon troubles (i.e. the incineration of their entire town) and Thorin refuses. Even the woodland elves of Mirkwood Forest come stomping in with an army to demand a share. And, of course, the orc commander Azog has unfinished business with Thorin, having devoted two full previous movies to hunting the would-be dwarven king in hope of ending his bloodline. So all of these armies converge on the front lawn of Erebor forwait for itthe battle of the five armies.",/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2014,aharmas,10," Jackson does it again
","Yes, ""The Hobbit"" is a short novel, but Jackson is not a man who makes small movies; luckily for us, he can take an idea and with the help of his wife and the best available team, he allows to see worlds that dazzle and inspire us. Yes, coming up with three films from such a short narrative is a daunting experience, but after a shaky start, he managed to expand the story into a wondrous set of films. His latest is probably as good as any of the original LOTR trilogy.",/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2014,shawneofthedead,7," A decent, if problematic, final chapter for the Hobbit trilogy.
","There's simply no denying it: The Hobbit is no The Lord Of The Rings. While cast and production values remain absolutely top-notch, the first two films in the Hobbit trilogy have proved disappointing, especially when assessed against the sublime trio of movies that first transported us to Middle-earth. It's evident that the slim narrative of J.R.R. Tolkien's source novel - even when supplemented with details and backstory from his Appendices - simply doesn't merit an expansion into three unnecessarily protracted movies. Strictly speaking, The Battle Of The Five Armies suffers from many of the same problems as its predecessors. But director Peter Jackson proves once again that he's a dab hand at crafting epic battles underpinned by love, loyalty and sacrifice. As a result, the final Hobbit film is (more or less) the best of the trilogy, although it still pales in comparison to what comes after it.",/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2014,rooee,5," The frustration of the 144 minutes
","What a difference an Extended Edition makes. For the first part we got some jolly embellishment. For The Desolation of Smaug we got bags more depth and character. For The Battle of the Five Armies, it may - I hope - be transformative. Because right now this feels like An Unfinished Journey.",/review/rw3141182/?ref_=tt_urv
