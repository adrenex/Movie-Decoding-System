5 November 2022,andrslopz,8," Netflix: please stop saying North America is the world
","Why does Netflix keep saying ""the best of the world"" and the contestants are only from the US and Canada? I was expecting participants from famous party cities around the world. The format is good: first a general challenge that involves cooking and preparing a cocktail based on a specific criteria, and based on the cocktail presented the people who the judges consider are not good enough go straight to the elimination challenge. It is nice that they explain everything that they are going to do. I love that the show presents key concepts on screen when it seems to be an unknown object/term. In general it's a nice and entertaining show to watch if you like alcohol and learn about it.",/review/rw8789325/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2022,Macdonaldmichael,8," Needs a bit more insight on Scoring
","Many of the bartenders that we enjoyed got dismissed prematurely, I think it would have helped to have more transparency in the scoring so that we can better understand why our contenders were ejected.",/review/rw8789325/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,PrinceCharmingHere,6," Surprise surprise
","Netflix really does have a way with screwing up these unique competition shows (Blown Away) to fit their agenda to the point where it's so blatant and obvious and almost a turn off that you don't even want to watch anymore. Every elimination is carefully calculated and not solely based on who did the best, worst, whether it was their second time in the bottom or first, whether they keep underperforming, etc. It's about being as inclusive as possibly throughout the duration of the show. Let's be real, recently, shows like this are skewed towards minorities advancing onward. It's about making the underrepresented represented. Which is a good thing, but when it starts to become more about representation then who did better in a challenge, that's when it gets frustrating. I myself am gay, and this is something I've picked up on. In the first episode, I already knew the people who would get picked off in the beginning and the ones who would go far solely based on their edit and their sob stories about what a challenge it is for them to work in a male and straight and white dominated industry. In that moment, it no longer became a show about skill and talent. Let people compete naturally and be judged and eliminated fairly, or let them judge the cocktails blind. Other than that, the show looks good and the drinks are cool and the show has a nice flow and concept.",/review/rw8789325/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,cherrycarey-34914,7," Love the idea.....
","I've finished episode 4 and I've definitely gained a whole new level of appreciation for the art of mixology. I love the challenges and the creativity. That being said.....the elimination process is a bit of a head-scratcher. How one contestant who has shown ingenuity since the start gets eliminated after 1 bad cocktail when another contestant who has consistently received the same feedback every episode for his drinks (too dry and unbalanced) skates by again and again is really infuriating. Hoping the judging is more fair and consistent going forward, but right now, it does seem like they are playing favorites.",/review/rw8789325/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2022,ekwok888-725-796504,1," It's not really a fair competition and the judges are just incompetent
","As with any game shows, the quality of the judges determines the quality of the show. Netflix didn't really showcase what accomplishments these judges have and why are they so much more superior than the contestants. For example, RuPaul is undoubtably the best in her field and she IS the Mama Ru, or Gordon Ramsey is also very good in what he does. In contrast, who are these mediocre judges, and we need them to explain the rationale of their decisions, for example, why a red cocktail can win in a black & white competition ! When it's so evident that the competition is not fair and the judges are incompetent or just puppets doing what the network tell them to do without any professional judgements of their own, the entire show becomes a farce and ugly. It's painful to watch this biased debacle and the 2 ""judges"" pretending to know what they are doing. I feel so bad for the competitors who are really more talented and professional than those 2 clowns. The best thing that the male judge is capable of is to put nitrogen in the drinks when he refused to drink the same thing from Alex in the first game. It's beyond rigged and it's so distasteful and ugly and dirty. The judges should be ashamed of themselves and should apologize to all the contestants. I don't understand why Netflix keeps on getting these unprofessional and stupid people to act as judges, this formula will never be successful in making a good and popular game show.",/review/rw8789325/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2022,IAmKMaz,2," Inorganic judging
","The concept of the show is cool and the creations made are really neat. The judging is really bad and as other reviewers note; is done to fit an agenda rather than taking skill and talent into account. Realistically, Kate should have won having blown away every challenge thrown at her, her passion for the industry and her knowledge and ingenuity in the craft. As you get further in the series, you can tell it doesn't matter because LP will win to fit the 2020s theme of ""black excellence."" She is a great artist but any unbiased judge would agree Kate is the clear winner. Unfortunately, inorganic experiences are the standard across Netflix series.",/review/rw8789325/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2022,crouchy-34577,5," I hated the judges, just not tone
","So in episode 1 Alex makes a dry ice drink which the judges refused to try, but then in episode 8(i think it was)they encourage them to use dry ice and nitrogen to make a drink as cold as possible. I'm sorry contradictory much?. The judges seem to say one thing and then vote against the exact thing they just agreed upon. It's like 2 clowns in a circus throwing pies at one another. They ask the contestants to do a cocktail there way, so they do, only to get criticism on what they did and why they did it. In the end the show is a really good watch but the judges will get on you're nerves; except tone. Ps I'll never look at cocktails the same.",/review/rw8789325/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,lukaszstozek-32940,2," Very predictable
","It was obvious that LP was going to win. Not because she was the best, but because she had been propped up all the way, for whatever reason. This seriously is very disappointing as this should be about the skill and creativity, and not about race etc.",/review/rw8789325/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2022,alex_madskills,6," Sooo predictable...
","Pros: cinematography, when they present the cocktail is top notch. You can learn from the diversity of these drinks and it's amazing how they combine some elements. And that's where the good part ends.",/review/rw8789325/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,powellmblake,5," Predictable
","Was really getting into this contest. Saw some amazing cocktails that I would have loved to have tried. However, when Aisling, who was continually a top tier threat, was voted off in favor of Suzu, who was continually skirting by the skin of his teeth, it was so transparent that what they were really doing was keeping the final group as diverse as possible. I quit watching immediately. If the body of your work does not account for anything in a show like this, then the show has nothing to do with who make a killer cocktail the best. The show is only about keeping a larger audience. The show had a lot of promise though. May pick it back up later but that ticked me off.",/review/rw8789325/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2022,chissysweetz,7," Visually beautiful but...
","In terms of cinematography and visually pleasing elements, I was very entertained. The concept is exciting and unfamiliar which is what pulled me to the show to begin with.",/review/rw8789325/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2022,igaspodzieja,5," I agree with other comments
","Why was Aisling eliminated? She made amazing drinks and I would love to watch more of her work (as I am too interested in mixology). After she made a mistake once she was eliminated. It was so interesting to watch the show when there were skillful competitors at the beginning. But then it became more and more bland. Kate was amazing from the beginning to the end. But when it comes to LP I am not so sure. I really don't understand why other competitors were shown constantly (how they are making their drinks, what they think about certain competition etc.) and LP was shown rarely. Also, when the judges judged her work it was often like ""Yeah, really good"" and no more comments on the tastes, consistency, color etc. If other people who made reviews here are right then it's just horrible that the competitors are judged not based on their talents, skills and creativity but based on something no one has any control over (yes, I mean race and sexual orientation)! Come on, this is a fun mixology show. You can make separate Netflix shows which will focus on discrimination problems and I will gladly watch them, too!",/review/rw8789325/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2022,engler-mat,2," Predictable

9 November 2022,saunakspace,1," Created an IMDb Account just for this Review
","So so frustrating! I love how the show started and I fell in love with the contestants...i truly did which is why I'm kind of feel it's my moral obligation to well...create an IMDb account to write this review and perhaps I will write a review on every other place where I can. OK...so to cut to the chase. This show was RIGGED. I don't want to call names and spoil it for others but I mean...how hard was it to watch the finale. This is the ultimate issue with people trying so hard to validate a point that they fail to see artistry, true talent and creativity. Don't get me wrong...as a POC creator...I feel the pain but never once do I want something I don't deserve. Actually, I would give it up for the sheer respect of others who I know are truly deserving. OK. Never watching this show again. TOA, SUZU, KATE (and so many more)...true creativity with a sophistication that's a perfect blend of storytelling, futurism, minimalism and creativity! These were ALL equally important and this show really disappoints. It give you a promise of a love story and kills the main characters to say the least. LP....you were good...but not great! So sorry for my honesty. It's just my personal opinion.",/review/rw8789325/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2022,shirlone,5," disappointing
",I only made it through the second episode. I got a little irritated when one of the contestants made a comment of people of color being in the cocktail industry. If they had made the show more about the actual cocktails I would have watched more of it. It is largely being overrated in my opinion when it is an average one at best. There were a few cocktails on there that I would have loved to take a sip of. I thought this show would be a good one to watch but I was so disappointed. A few were voted off that didn't deserve to be. The judges were something to be desired for. Pass this one up and watch something else.,/review/rw8789325/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,rubenoftheorchard,1," Just skip this
","I am a bartender in nyc. And as other said the judging on this show wasn't good. I have edit this review... I'm about half way through. There was a challenge to make a cocktail with 2 specific colors. And not one of them did. I am a bartender full time and I can tel you that this challenge should have been easy and they all failed so hard.z one person was supposed to make a cocktail that was black and white... and they made something red... then put whipped cream and black currently drizzle on top. Are you joking me?! How about do a White Russian riff which is literally a black and white drink. Another person was supposed to do a purple and yellow drink and her drink had 0 yellow in it. None. But she put mango on the side and they said it was okay. Another person was told to do red and green. Green should be one of the easiest colors! You can use mint, cucumber, celery, cilantro, kale, green chartreuse, lime... what does he do? Cuts the top of a pineapple to make a bird for the green and then the drink didn't even have red or green in it. He lost. But I come on, where did they find these people? Do any of them have any training. Honestly i think the person who did the best was the first person that the judges eliminated. And yeah these judges also don't know what they talking about. And man too much drama! Like, a person loses a game and the they're crying and so is the winner! What? Have these people ever worked at a bar or in a high stress situation?! Sheesh. There was a part where the host was talking about the 1920s great gatspy era of cocktails and a contestant said that was era of terrible cocktails... are you joking? Do this people know anything about the industry?! In one, one cocktail tasted better but the other one looked better... and the one that looked better won. What are the judges thinking? If you go to a cocktail bar and it looks nice but doesn't taste great would you go back? Maybe not. But if it tasted great but didn't look great would you? Yes. Plus the first episode was about margaritas. Let's just say they were all super fancy... a margarita is not a fancy drink. A margarita is a casual Mexican inspired drink. You don't even have to be a bartender to know that. So why are all the drinks they made super fancy and like Japanese and other culture inspired. At the bar I work at we have a marg riff that useses a blended syrup of cilantro, mint, jalapeño and pineapple. That is better than any of the drink they made. So yeah. If you're a bartender this will probably be hard to watch, if not you might like it.",/review/rw8789325/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2022,hill-derek7,5," Cocktails: Great. Judging: Fake.
","I really wanted to like this, and I do... In the sense that the cocktail creations and displays are often really unique and creative. That being said, it was made very clear early on from the ""judging"" that this is not a ""who can make the best cocktail"" show. It's more of a ""who's the most eccentric for TV"" show, mixed with a (hate to say it) ""how can we be the most inclusive with no regards to the actual competition"" show.",/review/rw8789325/?ref_=tt_urv

22 November 2022,vanekintopp,2," LP should never win.. sad they choose the winner for the wrong reason
","I was loving the show and once more Netflix blew it. LP was not the best, she won because they want an afro-american person to win. Simple is that. Kate deserved to win. So sad to see Netflix playing the scores to make LP win, she did not have a black and white cocktail and in that episode she should have left, not Alex. I still prefer glass blowers, at least this one netflix did not have an agenda and it seemed based on pure talent. If they release a second season of drink masters I hope to see the judges judging not based on race, skin color or minorites vs the world, they should just judge talent. So sad for this show, had everything to be great but is not.",/review/rw8789325/?ref_=tt_urv

31 October 2022,bryanallen-41055,10," Wow so predictable ans ignorant of the JUDGES
",To get rid of one of the best competitors and POSSIBLY THE WINNER of the show is ridiculous. I also done watching because it's not about the best clearly and she was only on the bottom because she had to be in a team with challengers that was on the bottom all the time and instead of realizing this and she had one multiple challenges is so stupid and ignorant. And it's clear people feel the same as I do based on the review above me. Shows make money based in how many viewers and you just lost another one. I am done. Maybe if she would have been LBGQ or something she would have not been eliminated it. Her technique was flawless and she did everything by taking risks and it made the show awesome to watch until she left. What's sad is just by reading this review most people who watch the show can guess the ne of the person I am talking about.,/review/rw8789325/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,wiz_glen,6," Not sure yet...
","I'm not sure if this show is worth to continue watching. I am up to Episode 5 now. I had to stop and take a break because I am not liking how the contestants were being eliminated: Natalie, Raj, Meredith, and Aisling. I am shocked with the judges' choice of words by saying one thing and then eliminate the better person? That doesn't make sense. I am started to think if this show was fixed or favoritism. Are the judges being fair or are they trying to get rid of the best ones and keep the bad ones for the audiences? I don't know. I haven't seen the end yet, then I will express how I feel about it.",/review/rw8789325/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,coles_notes,5," Average
","A netflix competition series has 12 mixologists compete in this elimination competition to crown the ultimate drink master. I watched this while having the flu, and while ""high stakes"" competition reality shows are usually right up my alley there was something I just wasn't feeling about this. It always felt funny hearing the 45 minute or 1 hour time limits, thinking if it took my bartender 45 minutes to make my drink I'd be quite upset. I understand they're doing a bunch of prep work to make a single drink so the long time limits are totally justified, but it really made then enhancing the sense of urgency so much more bizarre. Lastly I feel like I couldn't imagine what most of these drinks tasted like, as they were alcohols / foods I had never tried before, which really didn't help me get into it. In the end its the same form we've seen 100 times but now applied to cocktails, if that sounds like something you'd like you'll probably like it, it just wasn't for me.",/review/rw8789325/?ref_=tt_urv
