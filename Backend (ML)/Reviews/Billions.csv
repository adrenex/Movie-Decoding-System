21 September 2019,GKoeneke,8," ""Criminal: XXX"" is a cool concept!
","I saw David Tenant in the UK version so I watched it. Very good! Then, after 3 Episodes, it went to ""Criminal: Spain"". ???? Same set. Same room, chairs, buttons clock, etc.",/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2019,gibbs-18172,9," Tennant at his brilliant best
","A superb 3 part unique cop / villain type show that is the best thing on Netflix series of 2019 so far. 4 different 3 parters this one based in the U. K. The others based in Spain, France and Germany. Having already watched 2 of the Spanish episodes I can vouch that I will be a fan. I have decided to rate each country separately. This would have been a 10 but the 3rd episode just missed the mark for me.",/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2019,gina_gemini,7," MAJOR milestone for Netflix
","This show will appeal best to hardcore TV watchers/Netflix fans. A 'claustrophobic' show with an engaging story, best watched in a confined room, preferably in bed on a cold day, with curtains drawn. :)
truly binge-worthy material.",/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2019,efd-10467,8," Great Spin on a Police Show
","Just extract the interview part of the standard police show and that's this show, but in a detailed and intense viewpoint.",/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2019,tb-07119,10," DAVID TENNANT WAS PHENOMENAL
","I've just watched the opening episode for Criminal-UK. David Tennant was incredible, what a performance! I didn't know if I would like the interview-style set-up but it keeps you on your toes the whole way. Great suspense.
I'm looking forward to watching the other episodes, but the show definitely started out strong!",/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2019,montymonvieux,9," Excellent
","Don't understand why this series has some negative reviews. I find it to be a smart and engaging police drama. Want more episodes, please!",/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2019,mohinderchugh,," Gripping Police Procedural Show
","It is intense , gripping ,engaging and intelligent Police Procedural Show . It keeps you guessing . Intelligent writing clubbed with good direction and good acting . I will recommend to watch all the Criminal shows Germany France UK.",/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2020,tilokaudaman,10," Brilliant Acting
","The most remarkable thing about this show is the brilliant acting. Each episode takes place in a police interrogation room where police officers attempt to get a confession from potntial criminals. The effect is absolutely hypnotic with stunning performances from some of the best actors in the UK.
There are plenty of surprises and interesting twists. It's definitely one of the best crime shows currently on Netflex",/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2019,Shymaa0000,10," hand that man an oscar
","I waited up last night for David Tennant's episode and watched it the second it became online. AND. IT. WAS. WORTH. IT. the acting is so stuble and contained. Tennant barely speak in the first 25 minutes and doesn't move. he never fidget, taps his feet or display any symptom of being human in distress or otherwise. makes determining his guilt one hell of challenge. the detectives are more animated but still, every move is counted for. I immensely enjoyed rewinding just to watch the micro expressions. please, watch it if you wanna stay glued to the screen for 45 minutes.
(I feel we are sympathizing with David Tennant's character because we are used to him as ""the doctor"". we need him to be innocent. stone faced doctor charged with raping and murdering his stepdaughter should have raised a lot more hate and suspicions than I felt)",/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2019,imdb-ikysmoviedatabase,9," Very interesting
",Seen the United kingdom version with only 3 episodes it was very easy get through and I really enjoyed I'll be looking forward to the rest of the episodes,/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2020,entropy_less,8," Why so low ratings??? This deserves atleast 8.
",Only a handful of filmmakers and networks attempt this kind of police procedural shows... criminal uk caters to a niche audience of shows like mindhunters and True detective..,/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2019,JohnM-9,10," Maybe the best Netflix series ever
","I said ""maybe the best Netflix series ever"" and yes, I love Black Mirror. The latter isn't always consistent, but the three self-contained Criminal UK episodes (there are also three each from Germany, Spain and France) are a 10/10, 9/10 and 9/10. The acting is immaculate, the script is as sharp as a razor, the plot twists are truly unpredictable and in the first ep, David Tennant is just incredible. The police procedural structure reminded me of Line of Duty, so if you are a fan of that Criminal UK is unmissable. I can only hope the Spanish, German and French contributions are just as good.",/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2019,dwankan,3," Wonderful Acting, Terrible Writing
","Despite some incredible performances, this series ultimately only offers an empty bag. The ""brilliant"" insights by the interviewing detectives are either pure script or they were blatantly obvious from the beginning. When the story reached each of its big breakthroughs, I found myself either asking how they expect me to believe that or wondering why it took the detectives so ridiculously long to come to such a painfully obvious conclusion. Maybe I should get a job working for the Brit police: if they're that stupid, I'll be in charge within a few months.
I really wanted to like it because of the high caliber acting, but good acting does not solve the problem of bad, bad writing. The claustrophobic nature of the one-setting location only further frustrates the problems with the script.",/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2019,Sleepin_Dragon,9," A highly recommended series.
","This is a phenomenal series, it's a different take on traditional police dramas. I am so glad to see Netflix producing some wonderful British drama, Safe showed us what they can do, this is just as good.",/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2019,npjy83,2," Disappointing and rushed.
","The premise of this TV show is that each episode is an interrogation and interview process ONLY. There is no action, build up or background story. The police in this show aim to get a confession from a different suspect within each episode before the the episode is complete.",/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2019,ikanboy,7," More Mouse than Cat
","It's an engrossing series, if only for the chance to see some great acting by the ""Suspect Du Jour."" In each episode, so far, the suspects give themselves away, not due to the skill of the investigators, but due to the urge to babble. Then the tongue gets ahead of the brain. I was hoping to see intelligence versus intelligence, but what I see, so far, is poor plot writing.",/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2020,efd-10467,8," Series 2 even better
","The 4 episodes of S2 flew by, well acted and very well written, I hope more are on the way.",/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2019,Jeroenvandermeer,9," Stress and claustrophobia
",Amazing acting. You can feel the stress and the claustrophobia levels rising as the interrogation gets more intense.,/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2020,bshaef,9," All I can say
",Is this was just about perfect.. I could write a million words about the series but in the end it boils down to they were perfect. Way to go NetFlix. Please give us more of the same. I was glued to my computer for the entire series. That is very unusual.,/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2019,AbyGayle-23652,2," Disappointed
",I started this with high hopes. David Tennant started off well but ended predictively. The second is extremely dull. It feels like the actors are improvising and failing well. Like it's made up and they're losing their way. ExtremeIy dragged out and disappointing. Personally i felt it was a complete waste of my time. Others may well thoroughly enjoy it. But thumbs down from me.,/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2022,JayhawkJuJu,1," If This is How the Police Do it in the UK, be scared. Very scared.
",The first episode was super boring.,/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2019,mteague-29704,3," Starts well, but goes down hill quickly
","No depth to the stories, some good acting at times, but, overall, disappointing.",/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2020,watf-71144,9," Utterly Brilliant
","If you haven't watched this show yet, you are in for a treat.
My only advice is not to binge watch, let each episode sink in and wash over you.",/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2019,plasticanimalz,4," A Stage Play, Not A TV Show
","Recently, I clicked on Criminal:UK and Unbelievable, two new Netflix shows based on they both had decent B-list actors, and based on these actor's previous work I expected both to be good, and instead found both shockingly bad. It's like the SNL skit, Netflix is throwing money at anyone with a pitch. I can't even watch most network TV, based on how mediocre it is, but these two shows are really setting the bar on how low TV can stoop.",/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2019,normanemailer,1," I must have missed the first half ...
",".... of this first episode. I saw the last 43 minutes or so then, after checking, I saw the episode is 43 mins total. Extraordinary nothing. Who commissioned this? They managed to cast a big name in David Tennant and gave him nothing to do. The story? There wasn't one. It was pretentious. Don't waste your time watching this and waiting for something to happen.",/review/rw5144402/?ref_=tt_urv
