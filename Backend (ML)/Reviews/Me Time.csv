21 February 2005,BrandtSponseller,8," Transcends its flaws to earn a ""B""
","After Lewis Thomas (Paul Walker) buys a car to pick up would-be girlfriend Venna (Leelee Sobieski) from college in Colorado, he learns that his brother, Fuller (Steve Zahn), was jailed on a misdemeanor charge in Salt Lake City. So he decides to pick up his brother first. During a pit stop, Fuller has a mechanic install a CB radio. They joke around with truckers, going so far as posing as a woman and setting up a false date with one. When the prank turns to tragedy, the trucker seeks revenge.",/review/rw2907157/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2003,Infofreak,," A surprisingly engrossing and effective thriller. Not all that original but extremely entertaining.
","It would be very easy to overlook 'Roadkill' (the title 'Joy Ride' is known by here in Australia), especially considering the leads are mainly known for asinine teen movies. But dig a little deeper and you will see that it is directed by the underrated John Dahl, also responsible for the crackerjack thriller 'Red Rock West' a decade ago. Paul Walker ('The Skulls') is very effective as your average joe college kid, and Steve Zahn ('Out Of Sight') is even better as his smart ass older brother. Zahn is a talented comic often better than the movies he appears in, and he is in fine form here. The chemistry between the two is believable and amusing without becoming tired. Leelee Sobieski ('Eyes Wide Shut') has yet to make much of an impact on me, and there's very little to change that here. She is passable but little more than eye candy as Walker's potential love interest. The real star of the movie is the mysterious and frightening trucker Rusty Nail ('The Silence Of The Lambs' Ted Levine). Of course the whole scenario is hugely indebted to Spielberg's suspense classic 'Duel', but Dahl and co. manage to put a fresh and exiting spin on familiar material. 'Roadkill' won't change your life, but it is a genuinely exciting and effective thriller, a real rarity in Hollywood these days. Hitchcock it ain't but it's a very entertaining popcorn movie with plenty of thrills and twists. Recommended.",/review/rw2907157/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7," Pretty intense thriller
","The idea of this movie is actually pretty good; two teenagers do a prank call on a CB radio, but the prank turns on them. Most teenagers have probably been in a situation where they themselves made a prank call. At the very least, everyone knows about it. The film has some excellent shocks throughout the movie, and all of the 'thrilling' sequences are very intense, sometimes bordering on the extreme. The plot is pretty good, even pretty original, as far as I know. The acting is good enough. The characters are believable and their actions are understandable, most of the time. The movie has some very good cinematography and some pretty good cinematic effects. The ending, though a bit far-fetched, was the perfect way to end it, in my opinion. I couldn't have imagined a better way to end it. I recommend this to pretty much any teen who enjoys thrillers, especially the ones who like to relate to the theme and plot. Nearly every teenager in the world can in some way relate to at least one of the main characters in this film. 7/10",/review/rw2907157/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2007,drownsoda90,8," Scary Road Thriller Somewhat Reminiscent of ""The Hitcher"".
","""Joy Ride"" is an extremely entertaining road-set horror/thriller that was surprisingly quite good. The film is about Lewis (Paul Walker), a college coed who decides to buy himself a car and take off across the desert to pick up a would-be-girlfriend, Venna (Leelee Sobieski) in Colorado for a road trip together. He then learns that his older troubled brother, Fuller (Steve Zahn) has been arrested in Salt Lake City, so he picks him up on the way. After having a CB radio installed into the car, the two take off to pick up Venna, but end up pulling a prank on an anonymous trucker who goes by the name of ""Rusty Nail"" (excellently voiced by Ted Levine) on the CB radio. After the trucker learns about the prank, he attacks the brothers with his large semi, but they manage to escape. But soon after they pick up Venna, the menacing truck driver begins harassing them again, seeking revenge for the joke they decided to play on him - he'll stop at nothing to get it, and he's looking for more than an apology.",/review/rw2907157/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2002,Agent10,7," Sometimes, the Earth changes directions and I like a film such as this
","This turned out to be one the few movies I liked that was geared toward a teen audience. Steve Zahn and Paul Walker weren't natural in the roles as brothers, which embodied the very nature of their relationship. While the story became rather convoluted near the end, Rusty Nail's voice and detached presence brought some actual fear to the heart of the viewer. While the sound editing made this film, the relatively simple yet complex plot really turned this film into a satisfying movie experience.",/review/rw2907157/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2002,=G=,7," ""How about that one 'Candy Cane', cum'on...break, break!""
","In ""Joy Ride"", two brothers (Zhan & Walker) get involved with a big rig driver over the CB radio while on the open road. They set him up as a practical joke and unleash all hell on themselves as the unseen subject of their prank,  known only as ""Rusty Nail"",  turns out to be a maniacal killer. ""Joy Ride"" is a well crafted thriller which methodically builds suspense while avoiding the usual gore and guts of horror flicks. With only a few plot holes, this thriller should keep most on the edge of their seats. Worth a look especially for those who enjoyed ""Duel"" (circa 1971) which is now circulating on cable.",/review/rw2907157/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2006,wmjahn,7," A nice well made B-movie, a little winner!
","After KILL ME AGAIN and RED ROCK WEST director Dahl has again made a nice good-looking, really thrilling little B-movie! He must have watched DUEL (which is still better, maybe the best S. Spielberg movie ever, and rates 10/10) and has added something here and there. The Trauma Spielberg handled in his movie is not to be found in here, but it's still and nevertheless a highly enjoyable, also well photographed movie with believable actors and a nice twisted ending (improbable, yes, but still nice). Whereas in DUEL one just had the man (Dennis Weaver is his best movie) and a truck (without the driver ever to be seen), Dahl added more characters and a more visible (actually audible) driver + police, etc, but the basic plot, people running away from mad truck/driver, is left intact. I just wish more such movies would still be made today ...",/review/rw2907157/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2019,saptesh786,5," Do not joke with truck driver !
","Half movie is dull, second half is better. This is Paul Walker's movie from his earlier days, he looks teenager ( 18 years ago now in 2019). Two brothers gone on ride and making some kind of joke that pretending voice of a girl to unknown driver on car radio while highway run, but unfortunately joke is turned into a psycho killers' trap. Along with them their girlfriends also being involved in. Climax is interesting but end is not perfect. It seems uncompleted or having another sequel. Acting side is just okay. Steve Zahn is better than Paul Walker. If you are road rash or car/truck chasing lovers the you must see 'Duel' movie (1971) directed by Steven Spielberg. It is best movie on same subject. Must watch it for get real highway thrill and avoid this one.",/review/rw2907157/?ref_=tt_urv

","Joy Ride is a good scary movie.

25 October 2001,NickD,," A Disappointing Mess
","I went to ""Joy Ride"" with high expectations -- having enjoyed the work of Steve Zahn and John Dahl immensely in the past. But what I got was a poorly done by-the-numbers thriller with several numbers missing. ""Joy Ride"" is typical of movies these days that present a few good set-piece scenes but don't make them come together into a satisfying whole.",/review/rw2907157/?ref_=tt_urv

28 January 2004,lonicelee,," One of the dumbest movies ever!!!!
","I guess my review includes 'spoilers' so beware.   The entire movie is a spoiler...wished someone had warned me.  I'm wondering how old these people are who rated it above 2 out of 10.  I quickly thought it was a horrible rip off of Duel.  But it was much worse than that - nothing was sensible. Everything insulted my intelligence...from the beginning where he buys an old hooptie to travel across country to this big, dirty trucker being able to stalk someone unnoticed in his big, loud truck.  For those of you who didn't find it insulting, let me give you a piece of advice.  If you're being chased by a vehicle, go right or left...dont keep running straight ahead!!!!  The cornfield scene was totally insane.  They run in front of a huge truck and finally turn...only to stop a few feet from where the truck is located so they can peer thru the corn and breathe heavily.   I mean get a clue!!!  Oh, and now that he's gotten out of the truck, let me 'whisper' to my friend across the corn field.  It's a special whisper...the trucker won't hear it but my friend will...right?   Did I mention the trucker has special powers...they didn't mention them in the movie but he must have had some.   How did he know who they were?  Where they were?  Know their every move?  Know their names? Kidnap Charlotte (who was going a totally different direction) then catch up to the main characters?   Did they give him their itinerary?  I guess they had a special CB/GPS device.  I could go on but there shouldn't be any need.  Too bad writers/directors don't just say ""we made this for naive people who will be frightened by loud noises and be oblivious to illogical plots"".  Don't waste your money or your time.",/review/rw2907157/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2009,rmax304823,5," Don't Offer Rides to Charming Strangers.
","As low-brow thrillers go, this one is pretty well done. Two young men, Steve Zahn and Paul Walker, are driving through the Southwest to pick up Walker's girl friend, Leelee Sobieski, at the University of Colorado in Boulder. (Nice campus, attractive little town. Several fine microbreweries but avoid the restaurants.) Walker is a discrete and normal young man. Zahn is normal too but a little on the zany side. On the CB radio, Zahn talks Walker into imitating a woman driver whose handle is Candy Cane. A truck driver with a deep Southern accent picks up on ""Candy Cane"" and her seductive invitation to a get-together at the Lone Star Motel -- Room 17. It's supposed to be just a joke. That room happens to be occupied by an obnoxious redneck the boys have just run into. The driver shows up with some pink champagne and enters Room 17, where an altercation follows, resulting in the legal occupant being beaten half to death, having his mandible ripped off, and being left on the highway median. The rest of the movie has the unknown driver of this monstrous truck following the two men and then, after they pick up Sobieski, the terrified trio all the way back from Colorado to Nebraska. There is a final confrontation in another motel, with an ambiguous ending that leaves the way open for a sequel, should this original work of art earn a nickel of profit.",/review/rw2907157/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2006,paul2001sw-1,6," Rules of the road
","Stephen Spielberg's debut film 'Duel', about a man who inadvertently offends a truck driver, is still one his best, leaner than most of his subsequent work and none the worse for it. More than thirty years later comes John Dahl's 'Rodakill', a film occupying very similar territory, but in no way superior to its predecessor. Dahl is actually quite good at handling the action scenes, but his film is a bit cruder, a bit more over-the-top, and a considerably less plausible than Spielberg's masterpiece (the truck, for example, seems to have a tighter turning circle than a running human!) 'Roadkill' is still possessed of a certain gut power; but less, in the case of this comparison, is definitely more.",/review/rw2907157/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2002,TxMike,," I just didn't like this movie much at all.
","I didn't expect ""Joy Ride"" to be a great film, but several critics, including Ebert, gave it pretty high marks. Sorry, but I don't think it deserves them. As much as I like Leelee Sobieski, she seems relatively wooden here, and much of the excitement during the last half hour had her tied up with packaging tape in a motel room. The dialog didn't ring true, and the story of an unseen truck driver out to get that kind of revenge just didn't grab me. The night scene, where the truck was chasing them in the cornfield, was pretty interesting.",/review/rw2907157/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2016,Leofwine_draca,4," Disappointingly derivative teen thriller
","A huge disappointment, especially considering the excellent trailer which advertised this movie (turns out the trailer just about gave everything away!). I was expecting a tight, suspenseful chase flick with plenty of violence and bloodshed. What did I get? An edgy, middle-of-the-road, ""teen"" thriller complete with dumb humour, dumber situations, totally implausible scenarios (just what was up with that dumb-as-nails ending?) and many, many scenes ripped of from previous, better fare like DUEL, THE HITCHER, and BREAKDOWN.",/review/rw2907157/?ref_=tt_urv

","Co-written and co-produced by J.J. Abrams, and directed by John Dahl (""The Last Seduction"", ""Red Rock West""), the road thriller ""Joy Ride"" isn't the most believable or probable movie of this kind that one will ever see, but it's slickly made, and is genuinely tense often enough to make it a fun, if not remarkable view. It gets a lot of mileage out of the presence of its villain, a psychotic trucker. For the most part, he's a voice on a CB radio, and the movie does lose something once the filmmakers start showing him on screen. The climactic action is engrossing, as is one incredibly creepy scene (heard instead of seen) in a hotel room.",/review/rw2907157/?ref_=tt_urv
