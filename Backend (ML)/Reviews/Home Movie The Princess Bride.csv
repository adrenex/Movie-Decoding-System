","The original, with all its imperfections, is the only movie I consider perfect. Yay, it holds a sacred post in the inner pantheon.",/review/rw8206548/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2020,jaccjl,," Blown Away
","When I saw a Facebook post saying they were doing a remake of The Princess Bride, my reaction was an immediate, ""NOOOO!"" Then, I read the article accompanying the post which gave more information such as that it was essentially a homemade quarantine version. I decided to wait for its release, which at that time was just a couple of days away. My 16-year-old daughter and I watched the show and absolutely loved it. We'd anxiously wait for the next episodes to release. The Princess Bride has long been my all-time favourite movie. I could probably quote it from start to finish if I tried hard enough. I did notice not all of the lines perfectly matched the original but I was delighted by the variety and diversity of the cast members. I LOVED the surprise of seeing some of the original cast in this too. We laughed at all the appearances of Legos and stuffed animals and pets. We laughed at the variety of hilarious props including an umbrella, garden hose, whisk and even a dim sum steamer for a crown. This was amazing, it really was. It was perhaps the only way this movie could be remade that wouldn't have felt underwhelming. Instead it was overwhelmingly wonderful. Adorable even. I really do consider the original to be perfect. I also have to add that Charlize Theron was absolute perfection as the Dread Pirate Roberts. I'd give this more than 10 stars if I could.",/review/rw8206548/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2020,mrvino15,9," a lot of fun
","I can't actually believe this is on the imdb, lol. But honestly, I just love the effort the actors put into this, along with the props, lol. It's really just a lot of fun. Amazing job to all and thank you to all involved!",/review/rw8206548/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2020,jkaplow21,9," Almost flawless
","How they didn't get Mandy Patinkin (or anybody) to recite ""My Name is Inigo Mantoya, you killed my father, prepare to die"" is a major oversight.",/review/rw8206548/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2020,nightringer-76840,9," More! More! More!
","Watched the first episode and the messy castings, casts, inconsistency, low budget visual effects, under utilized famous actors, and blah blah blah.... You know what? I think this is a perfect remake of The Princess Bride for 2020. I can't stop smiling throughout.",/review/rw8206548/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2020,mairhi-1,9," Accidental Gem!
","I came across this by accident long after the demise of the platform it was put out on. I know that this was done to raise money for a worthy cause, and I really hope that someone (I am looking at you Mr Reiner!) can get everyone to set aside their egos and need for the pennies (or cents) (which they obviously did initially) and release this as a dvd to raise more money for the charity.",/review/rw8206548/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a pure joy to watch, a really decent, funny, heartwarming homage to a classic.",/review/rw8206548/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2022,lindyaleshire,10," The Princess Bride - SWEDED!
","You couldn't ask for a better tribute to a movie so beloved. Ignore the few reviewers who took themselves and this movie too seriously. This is so much fun to watch. Just waiting for the next celebrity and/or their kids to show up in a scene is half the fun! But some of these folks did some amazing impressions of the original actors. Grab some popcorn, gather around with friends or loved ones and enjoy this hilariously campy, homemade, totally sweded pandemic project of pure joy, As You Wish!",/review/rw8206548/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2020,jhbail-22738,10," Have to see it !
",I also was upset to see this being remade. I love the move and didn't want it messed with. But this was so great I loved it. Everyone did such a great job I wish it was longer. I also love the idea of doing this to other films. I vote for Scarface. Thank you all for making me laugh.,/review/rw8206548/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2021,garethwhite-88221,10," Outstanding
","I can't believe I've only just watched this. I can't wait to watch it again. Brilliant, funny, sweet, brilliant stay at home acting. Loved it.",/review/rw8206548/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2020,davidfonstad-48516,10," Wonderful
","This was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect going into it, but I didn't expect this. I can't wait to watch it again with my daughter.",/review/rw8206548/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2022,ANannyMoose02,1," Stop Butchering a Classic
",Don't touch Princess Bride. It's easily one of the best movies of all time. This series ruins the film for anyone who hasn't seen it. DO NOT WATCH THIS SHOW!!! Be for-warned.,/review/rw8206548/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2022,arasvebra,1," Inconceivable
","Couldn't not give this a try, even though the idea holds little promise. The show starts with instructions to hold my phone sideways to view properly. What? I'm watching on my TV. Half of the actors are reading their lines, and there are multiple actors for the same character even within the same episode. Why? Why this disrespect to a classic movie? I was about to turn off the first episode before it was over, but then it just ended abruptly.",/review/rw8206548/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2022,willster-83146,8," This. Is. The greatest thing. The internet has ever provided!
","I found this on Jenna Ortega's filmography and wondered what the heck it was with such a huge cast playing the same parts and then I found it! And I watched all of it in a sitting! This is the most adorable, home made movie with an allstar cast I've ever seen! If you can watch this and are a fan of Princess Bride please do yourself a favor and enjoy this tribute! As you wish!",/review/rw8206548/?ref_=tt_urv
