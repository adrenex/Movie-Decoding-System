10 September 2018,qui_j,9," Very funny but sure not for everyone!
","This animated series is completely irreverent, ignores all boundaries and plows along without much caring who or what it offends. The jokes are crude, the action even more so. It's a breath of fresh air in a time of puritanical political correctness, and the fear of upsetting fellow humans. It takes the worst of life, and makes fun of it. Very enjoyable series.",/review/rw5541526/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2020,muamba_eats_toast,3," Odd funny moment but largely monotonous
",Got the occasional laugh out of me but large periods were just completely finless one of the hardest series I've found to make it to the end. Would make sure you've got something else to do alongside it.,/review/rw5541526/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2018,jsucie,8," Brickleberry and Super Troopers Love Child
",This show is as if Brickleberry and Super Troopers found Johnny Depp's briefcase stash from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas; what they did can never be spoken of and *poof* out popped their love child Paradise P.D.,/review/rw5541526/?ref_=tt_urv

16 December 2019,invisibleunicornninja,1," So bad
","I went to watch this show because I've seen those funny fake 911 calls from the show. Unfortunately, I couldn't even get to the halfway mark of episode one. This show is so bad. There was clearly next to no effort put in the script. The writers were almost trying to make the show be edgy and offensive like good shows like Rick and Morty or South Park, but they completely forgot to be funny. If you find bottom-of-the-barrel crude and boring humor funny, than you'll like this show. Otherwise, don't waste your time.",/review/rw5541526/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2020,RoboGarrett,," I DON'T care if it's offensive, I DO care that it's not funny!
","Other reviewers are mentioning this show as being very offensive, as a good or bad thing. To be honest, I know they did a lot of bathroom and sex jokes, but I don't remember it being extremely offensive or dark or anything.",/review/rw5541526/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2021,iGlad,1," Season 3 has completely jumped the shark

24 June 2020,mg_legend,1," Terrible show
","That it's rated 6.9 and an animated comedy says a lot (even mediocre ones score 8+) yet is incredibly generous at the same time. It's not funny. At all. ALL the characters are the 'token idiot', it attempts to be funny with shock humour but fails miserably at something which is so easy to get right. Or at very least get occasionally right. Such a bad show. Not funny. Terrible",/review/rw5541526/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2021,nicholasfriis,9," hilarious to the bone!
",This may be the Family guy replacement we need. Brickleberry was funny. But they really upped their game on Paradise PD. Right from the start I fell in love with it. And since I first saw it I gotta say its really grown on me. So if you got Netflix and thinking about watching it then do it! No question about it. Its worth it.,/review/rw5541526/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2021,MoonwalkerKari,1," This show hates male victims of abuse...
","Just saw a clip from this s**k show on twitter - an episode where some characters tie ""Johnny Depp"" to a chair and not only call him an abuser, but say that they'll ""beat him up""...is this a joke? A man who was abused by his ex-eife, is now having a character who's supposed to be him, getting abhsed? On a f*king show? Whoever wrote this episode is sick, and I gope they'll be sued.",/review/rw5541526/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2020,cstover-28468,2," Bad animation and middle school humor
","I'm in no way a prude. I'm all for dirty jokes but the thing about jokes, dirty or not, is they need to be funny and at least somewhat clever. The jokes in this show are the type of things I would've found funny in middle school. Screaming obscenities really loudly isn't funny. How this show has a 7.0 rating on here is mind boggling.",/review/rw5541526/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2018,cranyy,10," Just like Brickleberry and its great
","I used to love Brickleberry, and this show is very, very similar, just instead of a national park its a police department, and by Golly, I am a big fan of heavily offensive shows. But alas Brickleberry got canceled only after 3 seasons, which seems to be the cutoff age for such shows (see Drawn Together...)
Sooo, my fear is this show, being equally offensive, will again not last for very long, even though its on Netflix, who aren't as concerned with the outrage of snowflakes as TV stations. ",/review/rw5541526/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2020,POIguy,8," Incredibly funny
","Paradise PD is one of the funniest, most ridiculous comedies you will ever watch. Just watch the trailer and the show really is as crazy as the trailer makes it out to be. If you're into low brow and slapstick humor, this show is for you! It is a bit lazy at times, ripping off Brickleberry, but who really cares? It works so well and is hilarious. Hope there is a season 3!",/review/rw5541526/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2020,wivavog,1," Terrible , Badly Written , Garbage
","I Love almost all adult animation from Family guy to Southpark to bobs ect. But idk why no one can see that this is just a re skinned brickleberry .same terrible characters, just different name and drawings sometimes..... Same level of writing ability (none) if theres 20 words in this show you can bet 19 of them of swear words.... im sorry thats not adult animation , just animated trash .... like brickleberry (even tosh.o couldnt save that abortion) And if you find this funny i feel sad for you. Like the idiot that said "" i think the humor is alot more nuanced in this show versus brickleberry"" LOL wow , simply WOW , The future is bleak ....
Show sucks , there is nothing subtle about it and its and EXACT duplicate.
Easiily Two of the worst shows. Usually anything associated with waco is awful and appears to have little to no effort ever applied. Just a check to cash aye waco ;] , dont care what you ruin in the process! But im glad you made so much from doing so very very little lol impressive on that. took a stick man added every cuss word you knew and ran with it!",/review/rw5541526/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2021,skiffx,3," Not Brickleberry
",Im a fan of Brickleberry and generally love adult animation. I tried watching this for a few seasons the problem is that because its uncensored on Netflix it lost the wittiness it used to have on Comedy Central as Brickleberry. They are just doing dumb jokes now because they can but that's not what made Brickleberry funny. This thing is too try hard for its own sake.,/review/rw5541526/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2020,kolemusgrove,1," Mind-numbingly terrible
","It's obvious that Roger Black and Waco O'Guin are as creative as a tree stump. Their intellectual bankruptcy is painfully obvious since they essentially created a re-skinned Brickleberry. How these ""writers"" have a job is astonishing considering they are nothing more than hacks at best. Save yourself a brain cell and watch something else.",/review/rw5541526/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2018,stephanandrethomas,10," Brickleberry continued.
","Excellent show, which if you've seen brickleberry and were gutted they got cancelled? REJOICE, with Paradise PD you can appreciate the ""similar"" recurring characters like Bobby, the doctor...etc, the humour and most of the voices we know and love!
This is a massive two fingers to those who decided to cancel Brickleberry and continue it in another way. Excellent characters, brilliant setting and perfect humour. Fantastic work I really hope season two and onwards have been ordered!!!!!",/review/rw5541526/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2021,greiweclan,2," Offensively unfunny
","After watching the first season i was surprised how fresh this seemed to be. Sure, edgy cartoons are everywhere nowadays, from Rick and Morty.to Final Space but this appeared to be more delightful, quite clever at times. Then the second season came along and it was nothing but peepee-poopoo humor. They are apparently trying to see with how much unfunny stuff they can get away with but it became repetetive very quickly while trying to build a story i couldn't care less about. I was done after the first episode of the third season, this show is the worst. 2 stars because it is exactly what it's trying to be, a show for edgy braindead kids created by manchilds who are just trying too hard to create the next best controversial show.",/review/rw5541526/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2020,rangrnav,3," Pointless toilet humor
","The first impression of this show is that it's well animated and well voice-acted. The further you get into the show, the more you realize that it doesn't have much to offer. Dirty humor works when it has a point, but this show never does. 90% of its jokes fall flat. It's trying to be over-the-top lewd for lewdness' sake. It uses worn out tropes and stereotypes to the nth degree, and it doesn't come off as edgy or well timed. It comes off as a big middle finger to middle America, who the writers obviously have great disdain for. South Park has been doing edgy comedy for over 2 decades, and is still going strong, because their comedy, no matter how raunchy or politically incorrect, is well thought out and relevant. That show has soul, whereas Paradise PD does not.",/review/rw5541526/?ref_=tt_urv

1 September 2018,bennyantlang,1," Dumb, Juvenile & Repetitive
","This is the kind of show which can only possibly be enjoyed by people who think anything offensive or gross is automatically funny, because they take pleasure in the idea of other people being upset by it, and dub themselves superior for being able to tolerate it.
Though tolerating this show is almost an achievement, actually. Its juvenile toilet humor and repetitive gags soon grow tiresome; a complete lack of variety, intelligence or subtlety means that even the shock value of the ""jokes"" evaporates within minutes, and you're just left with the sheer tediousness of it all. 
There are no actual jokes, just an endless torrent of gross stuff happening for no reason. You quickly become numb to the constant desperate attempts at edgy, offensive-for-the-sake-of-it pointlessness, and realise that the most offensive thing about this show is just how boring & joyless it is. Each one-dimensional character has one crude ""joke"" which they repeat endlessly; they have no personality beyond this. The storylines are ridiculous and inconsequential. But they're clearly not the point anyway; its obvious that the only purpose of this show is to impress 12-year-old edgelords and people who are too dumb to follow Family Guy or South Park (shows which at least remember the ""humour"" part of ""crude humour"").
Paradise PD has no appeal to anyone who places any value on their time. For fans of crude cartoons, there are many shows which are MUCH better (i.e. actually entertaining). This show tries way too hard to acheive virtually nothing.",/review/rw5541526/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2021,sebastianbachmayr,1," Gross and super unfunny
","No story, really bad and lazy jokes, sometimes just gross. I normally like adult animation, but this ""show"" is just so bad. Please do me a favor and don't waste your time on this.",/review/rw5541526/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2020,dtodd-24933,2," Laughed once in two seasons.
","Imagine Dave Attell and Ari Shaffir making a baby who goes on a month-long bender with every drug possible, and then, on the brink of finally falling asleep, vomits up a story line then is forced to throw in a joke every 3-5 seconds. Sure, you're gonna get some unique stories, but the effort put into the ""jokes"" is gonna be the least amount necessary.
The ""humor"" is as predictable and uninspired as it comes. But it's also nonstop, so like any  fiend, it comes, and comes, and comes. <-- if you think THAT'S funny, enjoy the show. If not, you'll probably be bored.",/review/rw5541526/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2020,ericschi,4," S2 to S1 is like the Hobbit vs LotR
","Absolutely loved season 1. It was gross, vile, simple and lovely fart humor. The storyline was continous throughout the season. The characters mostly had their own arch and developed as the story went on. While it's certainly not for everyone, I loved it.",/review/rw5541526/?ref_=tt_urv
