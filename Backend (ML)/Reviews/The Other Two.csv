2 March 2016,mapika,10," Season 1: as real, complex, dark and deep as it gets

2 May 2015,janoffpeter,9," An underrated series to say the least
","I am not to get long winded here but i will get right to the point in saying this is hands down one of the boldest productions made in a long time.It's message script delivery and plot development are so astoundingly well executed (no pun intended) that I give it a whole whopping niner.Yes nine. I wasn't sure at the gate but once this series got running I was addicted to the amazing performances delivered by some of the finest actors and actresses in the business.Welcome back I say to old favorites such as Timothy Hutton and Felicity Huffman. Great supporting form Benito Martinez as well.But there are also fresh new actors such as Richard Cabral,Elvis Nolasco and Caitlin Gerard all delivering top notch rolls worthy of special mention here.All in all a series touching on a vast array of tough social issues at a bruising pace.It's so realistic yet existential at the very same time.Don't miss it.I rate it higher than most.For some reason it has touched a nerve.I find the message here perhaps lies not in how the unique model of American racial diversity is infected or doomed to self-destruct but by how that very same diversity is re-routed towards or unified by the same challenges and confrontations brought about by drug and weapons abuse and by a penal system targeted at young black men.See it and come to your own conclusions.But see it!",/review/rw3206270/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2015,metromm,8," Art imitating life
","Life doesn't happen in neat chapters where one part of the story wraps up neatly and then moves on to another. Life doesn't present its main characters always with perfectly coiffed hair and Hollywood-style makeup. And that's exactly why I'm really liking American Crime. It's a slice of life - a very sad and often confusing slice of life. American Crime festers in the dark side. It brings out the worst in humanity ... so far. I imagine as the series gets further along, there will be changes that come with plot revelations and character development. I'm enjoying the well-thought out plot so expertly put into words, the richness of the acting that brings that script to life and the occasionally brilliant and always good cinematography. The score by Mark Isham contributes just he right tension without becoming overbearing or, like so many other productions, just too loud. I can't think of a thing missing. This is the formula for a very, very good TV crime series. I hope each episode is as good as the first two that I so much enjoyed.",/review/rw3206270/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2016,nicholasruddick,10," Not a Pretty Picture, but Great Television
","It's said we're in a golden age of TV drama, and here's more evidence. One astonishing fact about this series is that it was made by ABC, one of the supposedly fossilized networks, rather than by one of the newer niche cable channels. And now it's available on Netflix (at least here in Canada) so you don't have to dodge commercials.",/review/rw3206270/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2017,mg75535,7," The problem with American Crime is that I want answers
","American Crime focuses on the people surrounding a criminal case and the difficulties that they go through rather than the actual crime or criminal investigation itself. While I understand the merits of this and appreciate it the point they're trying to make, the fact of the matter is that I want to know the outcome. I want to know what happened. The acting is great and the series is well written (probably too good for network television though) but it's a let down getting to the end of the season having no idea what actually happened. The series doesn't need to focus on the investigation or be a police procedural to give the viewer a but more payoff at the end. We can struggle with the families of crime victims and ultimately learn the truth/see how things turn out without losing the main message of the show.",/review/rw3206270/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2015,mdefilip-01822,8," Excellent series but not for a network audience
","I watch a lot of foreign movies and TV series because I find most domestic products to be formulistic, highly predictable, shallow or simplistic (many fine exceptions exist - as examples True Detectives, Breaking Bad, Justified etc.). This holds particularly true for anything offered by the big 4 networks. As an example watch both versions of the series "" Secrets and Lies"" and you will clearly see the difference between an off shore and a domestic take on the same story. For me there is no comparison, the original Aussi version is much more to my liking. ",/review/rw3206270/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2015,piekarskia,7," the show you'll love to HATE. no spoilers, just a precautionary warning on what you're about to get into.....
","Part of me wishes I could just trash this show, but it IS actually quite well done. Very nice camera work, and pretty decent acting. At least, I pray this is acting and none of these people actually act like this in the real world. The unfortunate and tragic part is it just how accurately it portrays the potential depravity of the human race. Every single main character is AWFUL, each in their own wretched way. In fact, no, awful is far too good of a word. You've got your heartless gang bangers, you've got your drug dealers disgracing their military uniform, and back stabbing cheaters, degenerate life destroying gamblers, you've got your murderers, and your thieving prostituting junkies that'll do any and everything for their next fix. You've got not one, not two, but essentially half the people in the show are racists, and not just your run of the mill confederate flag waving scumbag, but racists on such a horrifying level it will chill you to the bone at the sheer depravity of it all. Your jaw just might hit the floor while your blood runs cold from the things that come out of these people's mouths. The only two you'll notice right away AREN'T racists are murdering thieving pimping/prostituting smack junkies. Go figure. The police ... well they aren't any better. And every parental figure on this show has contributed in full to the complete and utter rock bottom of each of these destroyed lives. I can't wait until each of these terrible human beings gets what's coming to them. I just can't wait. Because I hate them ALL. Each and every single one of them.",/review/rw3206270/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2015,CoolKid23,10," A fresh look at race in America without offending anyone
","Lets face it, race has pretty much always been the number one talked about subject in America. For better or for worse it seems that no one will ever stop talking about it. Fast forward to America Crime which is a brand new crime drama centered on a few characters who are all connected through a murder and a rape. Did not think I would be interested in this drama but after the first episode I was hooked. The acting seems to be top notch and realistic from everyone. The artistic view of race relations in this show is amazing. It's slow paced yet the conversations are meaningful and deep. I believe race can be addressed without offending anyone and this show does it. I don't think it's so much that people are racist but it's more that people make assumptions based on what people look like, the music they listen too or the tattoos they have. This show will make you think about how you view the next person. It proves that no matter what race you are everyone has their own problems and usually the same problems of everyone else. Gave this a ten because most shows that come out don't live up to the hype of what the show is about. This show gives you everything it promised no more no less.",/review/rw3206270/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2015,cybolt-51431,8," Premium Cable Quality on Network TV
","If one adheres to the belief that art reveals some critical aspect of being human, then American Crime is one of the best pieces of art I've ever seen in a network television series. The title may mislead viewers into expectations of a high-octane cop procedural; those anticipating such will be disappointed. Just like Breaking Bad (without the violence) American Crime operates on a much deeper, psychologically-taut, gut-wrenching level. It burrows into the souls of its characters, depicting each as they react to and evolve from a single murder committed in Modesto, California.",/review/rw3206270/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2015,runamokprods,10," Surprisingly strong and complicated for network TV

6 May 2017,m-arsic0708,10," simply great
","i still don't get the rating, it is one of the best series running. no cheap tricks, no ""unexpected but seen a million times"" turns and twists. each episode is just another brick in the wall for all the characters. and they are not black or white, they are grey. like everyone in real life. when they move to a darker or lighter shade of grey it is just life as it is. highly recommendable!!!",/review/rw3206270/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2015,phd_travel,7," A good cast and a serious topical subject
","This TV show about a crime that involves different races is serious and involving. A white couple is attacked in their home. The wife is raped and in a coma and the husband is killed. The suspects are African American and Hispanic. After 2 episodes you can see there is more than meets the eye as the victims are found to have in their house a large amount of the small screen drug of the moment - meth. There are some current themes about race, prejudice and preconceptions. This feels more like a cable show than network TV. Top notch cast. Felicity Huffman is quite transformed as the bitter, grieving mother of the male victim. Timothy Hutton looking bedraggled plays her ex husband. Penelope Ann Miller looks younger again and is the mother of the female victim. It's worth watching to see how things unravel as you look into the lives of the perpetrators and the victims. There is some serious quality TV here.",/review/rw3206270/?ref_=tt_urv

17 March 2016,michaelrthomson,10," Simply Brilliant
","I could wax lyrical about the acting, the writing, the direction, the cinematography and all the usual things people talk about.... all I will say is in a world where the kardashians are considered great TV/Entertainment, this show reminds us of what really is amazing acting, fantastic storytelling and compelling storytelling with a narrative in both seasons that is relevant to our times. Simply one of the best piece of TV to come out of Kardashian land in a long long time. Season 2 was even better than season 1, though very different story lines, though I did feel some ends where not tied up well in S02. That said, and to reiterate, one of the best shows produced in the USA that i've seen in a long long time. Felicity is simply brilliant, and why is it that we don't see more of the rest of this very talented cast of regular and sporadic guests. More more more please.",/review/rw3206270/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2017,SnoopyStyle,7," good for two seasons
","This is an anthology crime series. Each year is a new case and the cast takes on different roles. It is highly ripped-from-the-headlines and hits a lot of hot-button issues. Race is definitely at the top of the agenda but it is not the only one. Felicity Huffman, Regina King, Timothy Hutton, Richard Cabral, Elvis Nolasco, and Lili Taylor return year after year.",/review/rw3206270/?ref_=tt_urv

","I had hoped this was going to be a great series. Alas, I found it to be extremely painful to watch. The melodrama just never ends, great shows like ""The Wire"" have class & depth to the story that extends beyond the tragedy & drama at the center of the plot, making them more like real life. ""American Crime"" has no depth & way too much intense angry drama between the characters. The outcomes of all plot lines are all pretty predictable.",/review/rw3206270/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2016,hnt_dnl,10," Brilliant series...an all timer!
","American CRIME (2015-?) will rightfully go down as one of the best, most brilliant series of the 21st century. Already nearing the end of Season 2, I think it's the best series, with the possible exception of ""Six Feet Under"", of the century so far. ""American Crime"" is an anthology series, where each season, some of the same actors play completely different characters in a different setting and plot.",/review/rw3206270/?ref_=tt_urv

I can understand how many people may not enjoy this show since in their opinion "" it's not entertaining"". I highly disagree, but different strokes for ddifferent folks.",/review/rw3206270/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2015,danielhirst,8," Race and Crime in modern American
","American Crime focuses on the fact that a crime in modern America is  not only a violation of law by an individual resulting in a  state-imposed punishment, but is an event where tensions surrounding  race and historical prejudice play out in a condescend,  emotionally-heightened form.  The miniseries follows the aftermath of the murder of a white American  and the rape and assault of his wife. The man charged with the crime is  an African American male called Carter who lives a transient life with  his white, junkie girlfriend Aubry. The state's case is that Carter  robbed and murdered the man, assisted by two Mexican men: a driver,  Hector an illegal immigrant with a criminal past, and the car's owner,  Tony, a legal immigrant from a conservative Mexican family.  What eventuates is that the family of the deceased begin to argue that  the crime was a racially-based hate crime, while Carter's sister argues  that it is another instance of an innocent African-American male thrown  in jail based on limited evidence. The facts of the case begin to  diminish in importance as the overarching dialogues of racial hatred,  revenge and past transgressions take the centre stage.  As the show progresses, it makes the point that the race-based  dialogues of blame and resentment do not benefit those involved, and  individuals are sacrificed in the name of the greater cause without any  clear beneficiaries. It tells us that unless there is forgiveness of  past transgressions, justice will not occur either on the individual  level or throughout wider American society as a whole.  What makes American Crime a great show is that it tackles the topic of  racial tensions in America (complex in itself), but also highlights  many of the other impacts of serious crime that can often go unnoticed.  We find Tony being sucked into the youth justice system, and beginning  to acquire violent friends and tendencies that did not exist before  being tainted by the system. We see a network of victim support that  assists victims and their families in overcoming the trauma of crime,  but at times encourages a punitive approach that is too  revenge-orientated to be of true assistance to the victim. Moreover,  the adversarial justice system and an open court process can often  bring to the surface the behaviours of victims that their families  would prefer hidden from the public arena.  Generally great shows tend to not only be insightful and well-written,  but also have a charismatic lead character(s): a Tony Soprano or a  Walter White. No character in American Crime left me with the  impression of greatness or longevity. This is a weakness but also a  strength of American Crime, as it keeps the focus on the issues rather  than the charisma of any particular character. That being said, this  fact may lead to American Crime being forgotten or failing to capture  the audience size that such a well-written and thoughtful show  deserves.",/review/rw3206270/?ref_=tt_urv

21 March 2015,terryshilo,8," If only the US would attempt series programming like the UK
","It's working on many levels, especially with premium cable, Netflix and now Amazon Prime. The issues I have with American Crime after three episodes is, it's far too slow and the commercials break any continuity you start building. If this is planned at 11 episodes the Brits could do it in 5 and it would be a better, perhaps even a grittier program. The special effects (if you can call them this) are more in line with high school, college film editing courses.. distracting; I know they're using it to hide curse words because it's broadcast but use them or stick with broadcast standards. So far it's too drawn out and had the opportunity of coming close to HBO's True Detective. I'm disappointed. When you see as many commercials promoting the upcoming show and twice as many after it's started it's not a good sign. This pilot season will be it's only season. Unless it picks up and as viewers we can connect more with the characters where you become interested to the point of wanting to advocate for them all is lost. Producers only need look at Luther, Broadchurch, Vera, etc., it can be done. Why those shows are not shown here without being Americanized like Broadchurch being remade into Gracepoint; it was nowhere near as good and was made several episodes longer which did not at all make it a better viewing experience.",/review/rw3206270/?ref_=tt_urv
