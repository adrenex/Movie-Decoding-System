3 August 2022,subxerogravity,9," I had so much fun wacthing this
","Rare seeing Brad Pitt in a movie like this but from what I understand the director is a good friend of his. It's an action movie the reads like Smoking Aces. An ensemble cast with a few different stories in it, of which, interestingly enough Brad Pitt's story as a man named Ladybug could be considered just as important as the others despite being the star.",/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,FeastMode,8," Fun, funny and wild
","This is a highly entertaining action-comedy that oozes style. It's extremely fun and a bit on the outrageous side, not meant to be taken too seriously. It's filled with funny and memorable moments. The action is awesome, well-shot and clear, which is no surprise coming from the guy who directed John Wick, Atomic Blonde and Deadpool 2.",/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,RubyMouse,7," Fast paced and fun
","If you're fed up of dreary Oscar contenders making points and taking an age to get to them, this is for you. Entertaining, fast paced, action romp with good set pieces and plenty of fun moments.",/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,AfricanBro,8," The water bottle.
",Was excited heading into this because it's the first movie I watched on early release. Tried to avoid spoilers so assumed it was going to be Japanese/Korean just because I kept thinking of Train to Busan when I heard the title.,/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,masonsaul,8," Great stylish fun
","Even though it goes off the rails with an overblown CG finale Bullet Train is still a total blast from beginning to end thanks to the endless visual style, surprising twists and plenty of gleefully violent and energetically shot/choreographed action set pieces.",/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,jtindahouse,7," A relentless two hours of chaos
",I can't remember the last time I saw a film as full on as 'Bullet Train'. It is two hours of relentless action. It's actually a little exhausting to watch (it didn't help that the theatre I saw it in was set to about 30 degrees Celsius - but that's a different matter) - in a good way though.,/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,MUFCOK,6," Style over substance
","I make a point of not watching trailers prior to watching a new film as experience tells me that rather than get me excited to watch a movie, they essentially give me an overly exposed look at a film with key plot points being shown. With this in mind, it was almost impossible to not see parts of trailers for Bullet Train, whether that was on TV or YouTube advertising etc. The marketing campaign for this film is mental, I have seen it everywhere.",/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,Nagitokomeda,8," A non stop thrillride
","This movie grabs you from the start and doesn't let go. Its an entertaining whirlwind of goofy character after goofy character, and awesome fight after awesome fight. Brad Pitt nails his leading role and everyone else does great.",/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2022,thesar-2,4," Train of Little Thought
","This was like Guy Ritchie, Matthew Vaughn & Quentin Tarantino had a three-way in the late 1990s/early 2000s and Bullet Train was the result.",/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,jonny_mcclatch,9," Stupid Fun...
","I'll admit i've skewed my rating a bit, i've ranked it so highly rated based on the fact I knew what movie I was buying a ticket for. I'm not rating it highly because it's a modern classic, i'm doing it based on wanting to see a funny and entertaining action movie and in that respect it delivers pretty much everything I went to the cinema for.",/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2022,whatgift,7," Last act spoiled it, and outstayed it's welcome
","The build up was great - good action, witty dialogue and a well set up mystery.",/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,MatthewMichaelHoffman,10," It all makes sense now
",SCORE: 10/10,/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2022,cardsrock,9," Most fun I've had in a theater all year
",Bullet Train is a nonstop thrill ride that delivers some of the most fun I've had watching a film in ages. Don't listen to the critics. This film is a total blast and will leave you wanting to see more from this universe.,/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,sarahrayburn,8," Some of the most entertaining exposition I've seen
",I was not surprised this movie was as good as it was with the strong cast and budget. The humor and story telling were too tier.,/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,BenW1999,8," Choo Choo!
","A fun and crazy film full of twists and turns, incredibly surprised how this managed to scrape being a 15 UK rating with that amount of swearing and gore but still a fun, Deadpool-esque, film.",/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,latinfineart,4," They tried way too hard
","This movie is all about style with absolutely no substance, and the direction was truly horrible. The only good film this director has ever delivered was the original John Wick, everything since then has been really bad, including this film. They thought that they could do a Guy Ritchie imitation but Guy Ritchie is Guy Ritchie, and David Lietch is David Leitch unfortunately.",/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2022,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,2," Misfiring disaster wreck of an action flick
",STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * Awful,/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2022,imseeg,4," I had been warned that this Brad Pitt movie was a disappointment and they were right!
","Another Quentin Tarantino wannabe that failed spectacularly. The ingredients are all to recognizable: a bunch of weird characters, lots of violence, funny soundtrack and lots of flashbacks. But despite all these Tarantino ingredients ""Bullet Train"" simply hasnt got any movie magic or soul.",/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,pgeary6001,5," An Overstuffed Monstrosity
","It's clear a film is less than successful when an added scene pops up one or two minutes into the credits, and, rather than pausing to watch, the audience quickly glances up then resumes their escape from the auditorium as quickly as possible.",/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,ajikude,3," Overrated fake Quentin Tarantino movie
","Tries so hard to be a Quentin Tarantino movie but here the acting is mediocre to woody. The action is copied from HK movies, the plot is silly slapstick but problem was it's so predictable.",/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,Xstal,6," Destination Unknown
","The opposite of the Orient Express, leaves Tokyo Central packed full of excess, a veritable carriage of fruits of all kinds, who's psychotic nature helps them to unwind, with pistols and knives this journey just thrives, most occasionally passengers, pay with their lives, as the train snakes around and its venom is cast, the destination defined by their fate and their past.",/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,colewaters,10," Bullet Train is a fast pace thrill ride
","Bullet Train is definitely one of the most thrilling movies that I have seen this year so far. Brad Pitt, Joey King, Bad Bunny and Aaron Taylor-Johnson absolutely kill it in this movie. From start to end you will be on the edge of your seat. It's also very funny",/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,joiningjt,10," If you dont enjoy this film you need to check your sense of humor and SERIOUSLY get an attitude adjustment FRICKING PHENOMENAL FILM!!
",1st off I actually was told at the theater there was people that received their money back because it was to violent so they left SERIOUSLY these are probably the same morons who give that scumbag OVERRATED Tarantino 10s on all his vulgar violent films. This film is our favorite genre ACTION COMEDY!! Brad shows this is his groove he is so funny I wish he would do more any time he adds humor to his roles it's a home run I mean 12 monkeys was oscar worthy fight club I could go on and on but this film is great not just brad the whole cast is brilliant. Love the dialogue the action scenes just the right amount not over the top not super violent or vulgar like a Tarantino film its action done right. So if you want to go have an absolute blast and be ENTERTAINED for 2 short hours go right now!! Also phenomenal cameos from top stars who also understand the importance of humor. Man oh man that was FUN . . BRAVO to the WHOLE cast and crew.... BRILLIANT!!!,/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,tmoser1434,5," A Tarantino Try Hard
","When Bullet Train is not trying to be a Tarantino rip-off or trying to cram eight separate movies into one, it can be an enjoyable ride. However, this is not the case most of the movie, getting derailed by the third act due to a mess of a story.",/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2022,louieshowers,2," Tries way too hard . Another Hollywood Fail
","Lots of blood and luke warm forced comedy. Tries so hard to be a legendary film and fails on multiple levels. Tangerine and lemon do not convince me that they're capable of killing anything other than believability. So many unrealistic cutesy scenes and dialogue. The plot is overly complicated and tries desperately to rival a Tarantino film. Dumb character names and poor plot. Can we please start making real , innovative films again? Lastly,that female tween villain is totally a miss as far as casting.",/review/rw8478440/?ref_=tt_urv
