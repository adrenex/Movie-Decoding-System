23 August 2017,TheLittleSongbird,9," One of the most exceptionally riveting series to grace my television set
","It took me a while to review 'Broadchurch', wanting to wait until watching all three seasons before reviewing. From the very start, 'Broadchurch' had me gripped and despite a couple of things that didn't quite work didn't let go.",/review/rw2910646/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2013,A_Different_Drummer,10," 8 Nearly Perfect Hours...
","As if more proof were needed --- it is not -- here we see what happens when you allow a very talented production team to dig deep and come up with, essentially, a 7 hour, sequential, melodrama, or crime novel. (Eight hours less commercials). Even Hollywood on its best day can only do 2 and a half hours and is therefore handicapped (and when Hollywood tries to go the distance, the suits involved usually end up eating their own young -- check out ONCE UPON A TIME IN America, an extended melodrama that the late Roger Ebert once referred as the most disastrous editing job he had encountered in his career). Absolutely superb and near-flawless entertainment. Only possible criticism is that the last 9 minutes of the concluding episode are, well, gratuitous and out-of-place, oddly heavy-handed. The acting is stunning, not merely Tennant, who is always good, but the supporting cast is pitch perfect. The story is multi-faceted, a so-called simple murder in a simple town which probes the very souls of the characters involved. ""How could you not know?"" is a line of dialogue that pops up more than once, and is really the signature for the whole piece. If you can, watch it beginning to end and don't be surprised if you simply cannot hit the PAUSE button. It's that good. ------------------------------------------",/review/rw2910646/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2013,Tweekums,10," Gripping eight part murder mystery
",DS Ellie Miller is expecting to be promoted but when eleven year old Danny Latimer is found murdered on the beach it is thought that somebody with more experience is needed. That person is DI Alec Hardy; he has experience with such a crime but as the prosecution failed in that case he may be a liability. Broadchurch isn't the sort of town where such things happen and everybody is shaken; it is also the sort of town where everybody seems to know everybody else but as the case progresses it emerges that many people have secrets and as they are exposed lives will be changed forever.,/review/rw2910646/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2020,deloudelouvain,9," Once you start you can't stop watching.
","Broadchurch is one of those Crime/Mystery series that once you start watching you can't stop. The urge to find out what is happening, who is guilty, is jus too strong and so you start binge watching it, well that's what I did. I watched the three seasons in four days, the first one I would rate with a nine, the other two seasons with an eight. The mystery level couldn't be higher, every episode you think someone else is guilty, what makes this series so interesting to watch. But also the class acting from Olivia Colman and David Tennant, the two characters and their (non)-compliticity are pleasant and fun to watch. To me Olivia Colman was the best actress, she's very believable in anything she plays, she's pure class. The rest of the cast wasn't bad either, some better than others, but overall they all add something to the intriguing stories. They could have made more seasons if it was up to me, this kind of stuff just never gets boring, certainly not with the quality story writing they have here, that's certainly the best thing about Broadchurch, the quality story writing.",/review/rw2910646/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2013,reviewcentralny,9," Mesmerizing. A show somewhere between your most beautiful imagination and your darkest fears.
","An enthusiastic reviewer started writing about this show when it started filming, speaking with great anticipation about the creator of the show's previous work and then the premise of his new show - a crime story, inherently tragic, focusing on grief, dark puzzles and a small community in which everyone knows everyone. I immediately thought of 'The Killing' and whether I would feel the same sense of of despondency when I watch shows like that.",/review/rw2910646/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2017,Sleepin_Dragon,9," A quality series, that's provided many weeks of guessing.
","So Broadchurch has finally come to an end after three series. Chris Chibnall recently rounded off, and moves onto his new project, Doctor Who. It's a difficult series to review overall, the first series was incredible, I think it raised the bar for this genre, it was devastating, engaging, and re-opened a genre that had somewhat been underplayed for so long, the whodunit. In each series that's always been the burning question, who and why. Series one was fabulous, and gained the show a massive following, getting over 10 million viewers. I enjoyed Series two, although it faced criticism, the third series got the show very much back on form, with a very dark and gritty story.",/review/rw2910646/?ref_=tt_urv

26 September 2013,Pipkin_Sweetgrass,10," Beautiful Broadchurch
","I can't say too much how much I enjoyed this series. Unlike most murder dramas, this story isn't about autopsies and gunfights. It's about human nature. It's about the tragedy of the murder of a child. It's about the court of public opinion, the sinister nature of irresponsible journalism, the failures, frailties and flaws of our fellow human beings. This is 'Shakespeare writes a detective story'.",/review/rw2910646/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2014,SnoopyStyle,7," great ugly-secrets-in-small-town show
","Broadchurch is a small British coastal seaside town. One morning, Beth Latimer (Jodie Whittaker) discovers that her son Danny is missing and the police finds his body on the beach. Detective inspector Alec Hardy (David Tennant) has recently arrived trying to get away from the big city and a previous case. Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman) is bitter that Alec got her promotion. Her son Tom knows Danny personally. Her nephew Olly is an ambitious cub reporter willing to do what it takes to get a job on a big paper. As the investigation proceeds, the murder and the uncovered dirty secrets bring a media circus to town. The first series ends with a shocking arrest.",/review/rw2910646/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2013,keith-777-269807,10," New standard
","I enjoy British crime dramas. I find the pacing and depth of characterization is more engaging than the better American shows and there is often more emphasis on ""mystery"". Meanwhile I find the Americans are more innovative and the plots seldom have the holes that sometimes mar British crime stories. Broadchurch is a marvel. I have never seen a TV drama that explores the emotions of so many characters so convincingly. Crimes are traumatizing. Broadchurch gets this perfectly. Nor have I have ever seen a crime drama that packs a visual punch in so many scenes. The Dorset coast is a character in Broadchurch. It plays its role as effectively as any of the brilliant actors in this piece. And that brings up the acting. You won't find a weak performance and some are unforgettable. There were times when I was reminded of how exciting it was watch Sopranos for the first time. Broadchurch may even have the same kind of influence on future television filmmakers. It transcends comparisons between the US and the UK. It's a new standard and an instant classic.",/review/rw2910646/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2013,barmstrong-782-631970,9," Excellent drama, penetrating insights into the human condition.
","The only reason why I'm not giving it a 10/10 is because I have to leave a little room for humbleness. However, without a doubt, one of the best TV dramas that I have ever seen. It blends human frailty, melodramatic egos among professionals, frigid and temperamental relationships among small town residents, child anxieties, and mistrust, in a very artful way. It also shows the very real side of how people are often confused and blameworthy against everyone especially with the most flimsy of evidence.",/review/rw2910646/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2013,fergis,9," Crime show with a heart
",I have been loving the emotional depth of this show! So often families of murder victims exist merely to give clues for the eventual solution but in Broadchurch we are exposed to the grief of a bereft and torn family.,/review/rw2910646/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2014,trevor-mcinsley,6," Mostly good up until the last episode
",The first seven episodes were very good as they kept you guessing and threw up constant twists and misleads. A lot of these covered some real world issues in quite a sensible and clever way. For instance (spoilers...) the newsagent's story gave a very mature look at just how readily communities will condemn people with a history of sex offences and brand them as a paedophile when the reality might be far from that. It also portrays how the media can make things worse and how one person being murdered can have far reaching consequences on everyone around and dig up all these secrets.,/review/rw2910646/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2013,beth-clarke-783-108722,10," Best mini series I have ever seen!
","I have seen a lot of mini series, I love British TV - but I will have to say this is probably the best I have seen. Riveting. unpredictable and intense without over dramatization. At first it took me to a little slow but as i got to know the characters and the story that was progressing, I was hooked. The ending - I didn't see coming. But is was done so well. Relatable to so many people without being over the top. I found every character had such an important role that the ending almost came as a surprise. If you want a show that is realistic without being over the top - but at the same time relateable - this is it!!! I only hope season two is as good. The characters were amazing. The story line was believable. i could not stop watching it. If the other seasons are written with thew same demeanor and the same quality _ i will be sure to watch them all.",/review/rw2910646/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2013,jamesbelotti,10," An excellent British crime-drama
","Broadchurch is a fantastic and refreshing British crime-drama. The 8 part series can be complemented on its beautiful cinematography, compelling acting (particularly the performance of Olivia Colman) and a story that grips you. While the story can be somewhat depressing the depth of the characters and the well constructed plot makes it hard not to watch the series in one sitting. Furthermore, unlike other television shows centered on crime, Broadchurch leaves some subtle clues through out the later episodes, which allows viewers to indulge in guessing the killer. The only criticism is that some of the younger actors/actresses give flawed performances, but this is to be expected. I would highly recommend watching this show.",/review/rw2910646/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2016,Billygoat,3," Fizzles out in Season II
","I won't reiterate what many others have praised about Season 1. Great acting, good cinematography, good direction, great sense of atmosphere. I enjoyed Season 1...except for a sense afterwards that I had been swindled. -SPOILER ALERT - That sense comes from the fact that the mystery is solved NOT by the detectives, but by the murderer giving himself up - practically out of frustration at not having been caught yet. All that intensity with the two main investigators, and aside from coming up with gossip and small town melodrama (who's cheating with who?), no results from their efforts.",/review/rw2910646/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2017,korereviews,7," You know, it's just kind of okay
","Which is to say, I watch it, I enjoy it well enough, but I just can't understand all the gushing reviews about Broadchurch. I am a big fan of David Tennant; but frankly his character isn't very interesting or especially well-written here. Broadchurch is flat - there is no arc to his character. Olivia Colman is a great actress and if she weren't there I don't imagine there would be any life to this series at all, given that Tennant's character just walks around scowling. But mostly the format is rather trite and formulaic: small town, a heinous crime, wide cast of characters - everyone with something to hide, etc. etc. It's all been done a million times before. That doesn't mean it can't still work, but the writing has to be fantastic and innovative in some way. And this isn't. It's not awful, it's just kind of ... okay. By comparison, look at Happy Valley: also nothing revolutionary about the format or story, but the actors are great AND are given amazing material to work with. It's the difference that excellent writing makes.",/review/rw2910646/?ref_=tt_urv

24 November 2013,face-819-933726,8," How to make a hardboiled detective drama in a town 3 blocks long.
","If you Like The Killing, then you owe it to yourself to watch Broadchurch﻿. This entire series is summed up quickly in the words ""How could you not have known?"" but no one ever does, and that is what makes a good mystery as flexible as the rights of the accused parties in each episode. What is the result of a false accusation, or a simple conclusion that has been leapt to too quickly. Personally I think this show went 2 episodes longer than it should have. They were just repeating themselves for a while there. You will enjoy the actual story though once you get past the fact that it is a dry little dust mite of a town in the most scenic cliff faced beaches, and that nothing exciting is ever really going to happen.",/review/rw2910646/?ref_=tt_urv
