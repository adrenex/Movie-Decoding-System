15 July 2006,planktonrules,5," Fun to watch but a completely illogical and weak plot
","This film is an excuse to pair Captain Picard with Captain Kirk--something that should not have normally occurred since Kirk died long before Picard was born according to the shows. However, because of a silly plot device called ""the nexus"", they join together to kick the butt of the bad guy, Malcolm McDowell. Because of this odd plot, you only get to see a few of the old crew and most of the new crew at the beginning of the film--the final half is just the showdown between the three. I really don't want to get into a thorough discussion of the plot and all that occurs--you can certainly see it yourself. But the film packs a lot of emotion into it--seeing one of the characters actually die twice in the film. And, it is odd but original. The problem, though, is that with this ""nexus"", you can choose to go back to any point in time and relive it--trying to correct what occurred the first time. However, when the captain gets that chance, why didn't he go back several months or even years and prevent anyone from dying in the first place? This plot hole is pretty big and makes what happened in the movie irrelevant if the good captain had only used his brain.",/review/rw3568991/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2002,kenandraf,9," Bye Kirk,hello Picard!
","Above average Sci-fi action drama movie that has a modest production in comparison to the average high qualily fare STAR TREK film.This 7th Star Trek movie played more  like a special TV episode which although still good,kind of let down a lot of high expectations due to a great potential storyline and incredible trailers.The movie was rushed and the screenplay/script really took the steam out of the storyline.Also,the special effects were very trimmed down.Still,if one is a big Star Trek fan,you will never forget the emotional scenes of Captain Kirk(what a guy!) and the great acting of Shatner (not to be outdone by Stewart!) here.Yes,this one could have been so much better but I would take a Star Trek movie over the majority of Scifi movies out there!For Star Trek fans only......",/review/rw3568991/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2019,bkoganbing,7," The Two Captains
","A new Enterprise generation takes over from the old one in this Star Trek franchise movie. Remembering back when this first came out I recall that Paramount signed William Shatner and Patrick Stewart for a movie and then
wrote the script to contain both captains who roamed the galaxies a century
apart.",/review/rw3568991/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2020,Hey_Sweden,7," ""I was out saving the galaxy while your grandfather was still in diapers.""
","The crew of the Starship Enterprise have a major dilemma on their hands when a scientist named Soran (Malcolm McDowell), whom they'd once saved from his doomed home planet, reveals himself to be a very bad guy. He's hellbent on returning to something called the Nexus, a domain where, once a person has been there, they apparently don't want to leave. It's just pure joy. To stop Soran, Captain Picard (the great Sir Patrick Stewart) must team with the legendary Captain Kirk (the almighty William Shatner), who supposedly perished saving the ""Enterprise-B"" during its maiden voyage.",/review/rw3568991/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2017,Hitchcoc,7," Get a Life/It's a Movie
","I agree that this is far from the best of the Star Trek movies, but it has an interesting premise, the acting is good, and it gives us a cinematic transition from one era to another. Once Einstein gave us the business of time warping and being able to slip into alternate universes and revisit previous places, even paralleling the the current characters, it left everything wide open. I don't know what the big deal is with Jean Luc Picard crying. He's not a robot. Kirk was really a pretty one dimensional character with very little emotional baggage. That's great. Not everyone is Kirk nor should they be. Ultimately, we have a group of very creative people putting together a threat to the universe, a puzzle that must be solved. Through that aforementioned fabric, two heroes emerge and solve things. I have to get a little political here. I am so tired of people who are so wrapped up in these things that they actually get hostile. It's a review of a movie. Get out of the house more.",/review/rw3568991/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2002,LebowskiT1000,10," Loved It!!! Great Transition From Old to New Generation
","Despite some other people's reviews on this site, I thought this was an EXCELLENT Star Trek film.  In fact, this is probably one of my favorites of the films.  I thought everything about this film was above average, the story, the special effects, the acting, the directing...EVERYTHING!",/review/rw3568991/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2015,jamesbrandes,9," Much Better Film Than I Remembered
","When I originally saw this film in 1994 when I was 13 years old, I was distinctly underwhelmed but having re-watched this for the first time in over 20 years, I appreciate this film a lot more. Even though Star Trek will always work better as a TV Series, this is actually a very good film and I'll explain why below.",/review/rw3568991/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2006,ma-cortes,7," First and only reunion of the mythic Kirk and Picard in an exciting motion picture
","The picture is a crossover between the classic Star Trek with New Generations , they are incarnated by the usual sagas , as Captain James T. Kirk (Shatner) , Scotty (recently deceased James Doohan) , Chekov (Walter Koenig) and even a Sulu's daughter(Kim), they are reunited with the new crew from USS-17o1 , as captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) , Data (Brent Spiner), Worf (Michael Dorn) , Laforge (LeVar Burton) , Troi (Marina Sirtis) and Dr Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) , plus an uncredited Woopi Goldberg in a brief apparition . The film focuses captain Picard who must confront a villain megalomaniac scientific (Malcom McDowell) who has an only objective to get a bizarre , weird entity : ¨Nexus¨ which heads a relentless rout , besides he is taking on nasty Klingons (Brian Thompson) . He travels time and manages to hook up with Captain Kirk , both of whom team up and battle against the nefarious enemy . As always , the comic relief results to be the commander android Data , this time , he attains an emotional chip experimenting human feeling .",/review/rw3568991/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2008,tonycarr,5," Disappointing
","I remember when this first came out I thought ""Wonderful. Kirk and Picard in the same movie"" Sadly, I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's not that it's bad. It just could have been so much better. It feels like Star Trek - The Understairs Cupboard Clearout. Don't need Kirk any more so we'll kill him off. Enterprise D? We'll get a new ship. And there's the Duras sisters lurking at the back. We certainly won't want those any more.",/review/rw3568991/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2009,zirclet,7," 'Generations' Revisited
","I was for some reason compelled to put this into the old DVD player last night, and was pleasantly surprised. After 2009's big-budget reboot (which I was duly dazzled and entertained by), this comes off as a think piece/art film in comparison, and a time capsule from a period where 'Star Trek' was everything Gene Roddenberry wanted it to be- cerebral, compassionate, and thoughtful- and people were eating it up by the millions.",/review/rw3568991/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2017,zkonedog,5," Could Have Been Great, But Underachieved
","Much like the first Star Trek film, ""Star Trek Generations"" could have been great, but ultimately failed to create the high drama and emotional character development that fans of the series crave. The idea of Captains Kirk and Picard interacting in one movie seemed like box office dynamite, but did not live up to the billing.",/review/rw3568991/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2003,chibi cel-chan,," A childhood favorite of mine.
","I always loved this movie. From the very first time I saw it, at the age of 10, I absolutely adored it. It took a big risk, admittedly, in bringing the Original Series and TNG together, but I believe it did it extremely well and with a lot of ingenuity. ",/review/rw3568991/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2017,rooprect,," The Even-Odd Trek Rule
","Amongst Trek nerds, there's a hotly debated but generally true rule that the odd-numbered Treks suck (I: The Motion Picture, III: The Search for Spock, and V: Kirk Kills God) while the even-numbered ones kick ass (II: The Wrath of Khaaaaaaan, IV: Spock Hugs a Whale, VI: The Undiscovered Country). I myself disagree strongly with regard to #1 and #5 which are two of my favorites, but alas even I must concede that they were generally not well received.",/review/rw3568991/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2005,boyinflares,7," Solid, but disappointing
","The one problem we have with the Next Generation films (all four of them) is that someone high up in the film-making process seems to forget that the Next Generation began as a television series about equals, as opposed to the Original Series having 3 stars and a lot of supporting characters. I understand that Picard and Data are seen as the most popular characters in the Next Generation that appeal to the general public, but the story lines that get played out for the two of them in the movies (family and finding humanity) have already been done in the series.",/review/rw3568991/?ref_=tt_urv

","Been home nursing an emergency tooth extraction over the past week and nothing was able to assuage the misery like wallowing in ""Star Trek"". I watched a bunch of the cartoon shows & made myself come to grips with THE FINAL FRONTIER (re: Shatner's movie), which managed to be fun when regarded as a study in applied narcissism. But boy how I dislike GENERATIONS, and won't be watching it, though I decided to try and deal with my feelings about it once and for all.",/review/rw3568991/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2003,sddavis63,8," Perhaps The Best Of The Star Trek Movies
","In my opinion, ""Generations"" is the best of the Star Trek movie series for a number of reasons. Although ""The Undiscovered Country"" represented a fitting ending for the original crew, this movie was a good way of blending original Trek with Next Generation Trek. Given almost 80 years difference in the generations, I though the solution for doing this was quite ingenious. 78 years apart, both Kirk (William Shatner) and Picard (Patrick Stewart) find themselves sucked into the ""Nexus"" - a huge energy ""ribbon"" in which time has no meaning - where they meet each other and join forces to defeat this instalment's villain - Dr. Soren (Malcolm McDowell, in what I thought was an excellent performance; he's one of the better villains to appear in the Star Trek movies.)",/review/rw3568991/?ref_=tt_urv

Kirk manages to save some of the refugees before losing himself to the energy ribbon. Two of the survivors are Tolian Soran (Malcolm McDowell) and Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg). Almost eighty years later, The Next Generation crew encounters Soran who is working with the Klingon Duras sisters for his own purpose of returning to the energy ribbon and Nexus.",/review/rw3568991/?ref_=tt_urv

14 October 2014,Leofwine_draca,5," Stodgy end for the original crew
","STAR TREK: GENERATIONS was widely heralded as the cross-over movie that featured crews from both the original 1960s STAR TREK along with the cast of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION. Unfortunately it's pretty much a failure on both counts, coming across as a particularly stodgy extended TV episode.",/review/rw3568991/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2007,CalvinValjean,6," An In-Depth Review
","One does have to admire Star Trek: Generations and what it tries to do. In short, it is given the difficult task of having to bring closure in two ways: 1. Closure for the character of Kirk, who's been around since the beginning of all Star Trek, and 2. Closure for the TNG series, which had just wrapped, and now had to destroy their Enterprise-D set before moving to further adventures. For the most part, you have a success until the last act.",/review/rw3568991/?ref_=tt_urv
