18 June 2009,VetteRanger,9," A Guilty Favorite
","Gordon Ramsay, a rich and famous chef, years ago hit the reality TV circuit by acting as a consultant to failing restaurants.",/review/rw5072309/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2007,magellan333,7," Ramsay makes the show.
","Hell's Kitchen introduced me to Gordon Ramsay. The commercials for that show portray him as a harsh tyrant in a chef's jacket. This is not the case on Hell's Kitchen or on Kitchen Nightmares. Kitchen Nightmares is an enjoyable show that allows the viewer to better understand what goes on behind the scenes of the restaurant business. Part of the the show's entertainment though lies in the incompetence and arrogance of those working in the restaurants Gordon Ramsay sets out to rescue. Without Gordon Ramsay, this show would find itself on The Food Network or TLC. He truly makes the show great as he is hard but fair. He seeks to raise the bar to improve skills, decor and ultimately business. As he does this, it makes for a fairly entertaining reality show.",/review/rw5072309/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2011,Meven_Stoffat,10," My favourite guilty pleasure
","In all honesty, I have a gigantic man crush on Gordon Ramsay. There's just no one else like him. He tells it like it is, and There's just nothing he cannot do. Or so it seems. I'll admit I'd hate to be some runt on the show, but that's a good thing. And Kitchen Nightmares is proof that sometimes, one voice IS enough to stop a restaurant from serving crap.",/review/rw5072309/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2019,13Funbags,2," So fake
","In every episode the owner has asked Ramsey to come fix their restaurant. Then they fight with him and say there's nothing wrong with their restaurant. Ramsey threatens to leave, the owner wakes up and everything ends up great. Scripted crap.",/review/rw5072309/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2011,dcorvino,6," Not as good as the BBC version
","Although I am a fan of the series, the American version of Kitchen Nightmares is not as good as the British version. The American version seems much more dramatic. It is loaded with arguments, family problems, and near fisticuffs. The British version concentrates on the restaurant's problems and how to solve them. It is excellent. I don't want to see a bunch of staged drama (Similar to the fake drama in Cake Boss). I want reality, something that is missing from reality TV! I want to watch Gordon identify the problems, and fix the problems. Along the way, show me how the food is made and improved upon. And by the way, does Gordon really hate every single first meal he has at these restaurants? The chefs can't be that bad, at least not some of them anyway.",/review/rw5072309/?ref_=tt_urv

12 October 2007,Zaniac1273,8," An enjoyable reality series
","After my wife got me addicted to Hell's Kitchen (US) during its first season, we've jumped at the opportunity to watch every show or series we could with Gordon in it.",/review/rw5072309/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2020,SadDevilExperience,7," This is the best reality TV series.
","Every episode of Kitchen Nightmares is the same. There's a failing restaurant, and we get an overview of the restaurant and why it's failing. The problems vary from a stubborn chef, a spineless owner, a clueless staff, or some mix of the above, but one thing is common: the food is terrible, but the owners don't seem to believe that. Gordon comes in, sees the restaurant, tries the food (big shock, he doesn't like the food) and he tells the owners that the food is not good, and the owners disagree and insist that their food is good, which leaves Chef Ramsay speechless. Later that night, he observes a terrible dinner service and then later inspects a more than filthy kitchen and Ramsay is furious. After getting the owners on board with change (which takes some time), they relaunch the menu (and most of the time, the decor), and the relaunch is a success, with the exception of a minor hiccup. That is your average Kitchen Nightmares episode........and I love it! There's something hypnotic about watching stubborn people so deep in denial getting yelled at by a decorated chef over how terrible their service and food are. My only concern with this show is how dramatized it is. They seem to focus more on drama between family and coworkers than they do on how a restaurant operates. In addition, some of the exercises Gordon Ramsay does with the owners seemed pointless. There was one episode that took place in a courtroom halfway through and two episodes had the owners boxing their feelings out. Those felt bizarre, like it was purely for theatrics. Other than that, I enjoyed this show. It had a capable formula and even featured some colorful personalities, and it actually made me want start cooking more.",/review/rw5072309/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2018,Mat_Nichol,4," Too predictable.
",Spoiler: it's a family run restaurant and they all argue with each other and nobody takes responsibility for anything. One of the staff will storm out shouting/crying.,/review/rw5072309/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2011,byerly0503,," Watch 1 Episode and you have seen them all.
","This show holds up to the usual lack of any redeeming values you'd expect in a show on FOX. All of the time on camera is spent watching family members yell at each other, dimwitted employees, Ramsay complaining, and patrons sending food back. Anything related to running a kitchen, the business of a restaurant, or cooking food is omitted. Don't bother to watch more than one episode since they are exactly the same.

21 January 2022,josephmayes,10," A Blessing from Britain
","What can I say that hasn't been said about this legendary, controversial Reality TV show? While I prefer the British version of the show for its more relaxed approach and little-to-no reliance on special effects and melodrama, I cannot deny that the American version is JUST as great in its own way. And all of that has to do with the S-tier legend himself, Gordon Ramsey.",/review/rw5072309/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2008,jboothmillard,7," Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares USA
","I can't miss the British series, so I thought I might as well try the American version. National Television Award nominated Gordon Ramsay every week basically travels to America, visits some of the failing restaurant, bar or caf√© businesses with customers, food quality and ideas, takings, attitude, financial difficulties (e.g. debts) and the business itself, and it is Ramsay's job to help as much as he can to make it a more profitable and improved business for the workers and customers together. Ramsay's use of swearing, particularly ""the f word"" is still prominent and gets some of the great laughs, and also how stupid or ridiculous some of the business bosses, employees or main staff members behave in the work environment that is meant to be cooperating. It is very good to see just how bad these eating places are working, but it is also nice in the end to see most of the businesses saved. Gordon Ramsay was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 82 on The 100 Worst Britons (for his arrogance I guess). Very good!",/review/rw5072309/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2021,hlee-74887,10," Culinary Justice
","This show is essentially a guide for all restaurant owners of what they should NOT do. Majority of the show is dedicated to Ramsey's deconstruction of a failing restaurant. From the rotten fridge, egotistical chefs, owners who micromanage, false advertisement....nothing is missed. After the chaos than comes order. From tearful frustrations and anger flailing, the show usually takes a 180 turn where humility comes in a form of a new start. Ramsey's punch-to-the-face constructive criticism never gets old.",/review/rw5072309/?ref_=tt_urv

15 July 2022,dream_collector,10," The only reality show that I can binge on!
","I find this show addictive, despite every episode being pretty much the same: Chef Ramsay goes to a failing restaurant, he sits down and tries various dishes off the menu (which all taste revolting), the owner is a delusional nutcase who thinks the food is amazing, the storage of the food is in violation of every health code imaginable, the owner argues with Chef Ramsay, the restaurant receives a makeover, the menu is revamped, and the owner apologizes for giving Chef Ramsay a hard time. Even I will admit, it is repetitive. It also gets annoying how a female server/hostess/cook always says Chef Ramsay is hot. They must get paid to say that, because there is nothing hot about this man. All of the lines on his face. Judging from the appearance of his skin, it looks like he doesn't drink water or use lotion. Despite the repetition, I binge watch this with no problem. It's quite unsettling to think I spent so many years eating out, considering the horrid conditions of restaurant kitchens. As gross as it is to see, it can be quite eye opening, thus making the viewer realize how important it is to cook at home. Many of the restaurants that were on this show are no longer open. When I Google the names of these places, nothing comes up. I did manage to find one that's still in operation, but I wonder if they'll be able to stay open. A one star review that was fairly recent was from a customer who said they heard the owner yelling at staff members in the kitchen. Their server told them it was because the owner had relationship issues and couldn't satisfy women. The customer and the rest of their table laughed (personally, I think it's inappropriate for a server to say something like that to customers), but then one of the servers, a woman, came out crying so hard that snot was coming out of her nose. So it sounds like the owner has went back to treating the employees like garbage. It's really sad to think all of the work Chef Ramsay did was pointless at the end of the day. Overall, if you don't like the typical set up of reality shows (for example, a bunch of people living on a desert island and competing for a prize), then this show is worth giving a try.",/review/rw5072309/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2021,vinceperiod,9," So Much Respect For Gordon Ramsay!!
","Love the show! Gordon knows how to fix kitchens and straighten everyone up and he can do it well. He shows compassion and respect when they work super hard and are only days away from failing and he gets so into it he almost cries. He's brought with joy when he reunites with old restaurant employees and you can see how much he's just trying to help. He's always making sure the chefs and employees are okay before he starts trying to change things. He asks for opinions and he tries to make everyone as comfortable as possible and he even goes through metaphorical and symbolic ways to help the health of the employees. The only reasons the businesses sometimes end up failing is because 1. They resort back to their old ways or 2. They can't handle it financially. One of my favorite shows to watch especially to see how hard it is behind the scenes. After learning about how much Gordon went through filming that show, I show so much respect. He ate so much raw meat he got food poisoning for a month, he's eaten moldy food, old food and all to figure out what he was dealing with in the kitchen. He's sacrificed his own health for the better health of the others around him. Nothing but respect for him.",/review/rw5072309/?ref_=tt_urv

","As a professional in the business, I can only cringe in horror as I watch painfully how one individual (in the name of entertainment) can damage, taint, and downright slander the hospitality profession with his profane and crude operating style. No Management would EVER tolerate a chef like Ramsey, no matter how talented he may be. At the end of the day it's about coaching, guidance, mentoring and motivation. Not nervous breakdowns, strain, stress, aggression and vitriol. Sure these places have problems, but the solutions do not lie in a 7 day fix. Clean Kitchens and stores require training, education of hygiene practices, process analysis and much more. For those poor people who were considering working in the kitchen or in the restaurant business, this is reality TV, plumped up with assumption, false premise and downright misrepresentation. Don't let this abomination of a show put you off. The reality in this case is different.",/review/rw5072309/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2010,keirster,9," VERY entertaining!!!
","I was first hooked on ""Hell's Kitchen"" and now this show is a must as well. Do they do certain things to create tension? Absolutely, this is television! All in all, it is refreshing to see a renowned chef come into a location and turn it around with his expertise as well as improve the decor. I would guess they pick locations where the owners are sure to clash with Gordon, but he can handle himself just fine. Some of the owners and chef's at these restaurants need a good kick in the pants to show them that just because you can own a restaurant or that you can cook, doesn't mean that you should. It is all about passion for what you do. I love the British TV version as well. The only down side is that I get REALLY hungry when I watch all the good dishes that Gordon prepares.",/review/rw5072309/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's a 7 but only because Chef Ramsay is absolutely hilarious (in my opinion). I may be weird but I reckon he is really funny. He turns restaurants around because they're underperforming, management issues or whatever the real problem is. I recommend that Gordon Ramsay fans watch this show, you won't regret it.",/review/rw5072309/?ref_=tt_urv
