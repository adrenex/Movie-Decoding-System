8 December 2022,amywilson-14755,9," Freaky horror delight!
","This was such a fun discovery for me - think Below Deck meets Hot Fuzz with a dash of Scream and Scream Queens. Each episode just got better and better. After reading some of the other user reviews, this is clearly a show that some will appreciate and others will not. I think some reviewers have missed a couple things. Wreck is firmly set in a Slasher universe, and so tonally it's a little madcap, but it also has a lot more depth than most slasher films. It's clear that a lot of thought and love has gone into the making of this show. It features all the other horror conventions we've come to know and love, but also proper, real feeling 3D dimensional characters - and hooray for proper queer representation that isn't all doom and gloom. I'll admit it, I'm a grown woman, and not the target audience, but I love this show. It kept me guessing to the end, and I never saw the BIG twist coming...",/review/rw8675959/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2022,missmishka,10," Hostel on the high seas
","I binged this in a day and need more! What, at first, appears to viewers to be a killer in a duck costume turns out to be so much more than Jamie Walsh ever could have imagined when he got aboard the Sacramentum cruise ship to find out what happened there to his sister Pippa. I won't spoil it, but let ""Hostel"" be a hint. Though I hated that movie and loved this show. The show only has a few funny moments, so I agree with other reviews that say that, but it does have darkly comedic moments and lives up to the slasher horror categorization. Eventually. It does draw things out to give it more of a mystery feel for the overall plot. There's also more focus on developing relationships than one might like if they're only here for the horror, but I personally loved the mix of tone and themes. It's a bunch of young adults out on their own on the high seas, many for the first time, exploring their independence and sexuality while a growing number of crew come to realize that their employers are as Evil Corp as a company can get. Stay with this one til the end. It is worth it, even if you want to speed through the more teen drama moments.",/review/rw8675959/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2022,holzifer,9," Genuinely loved it!
","This was such a surprisingly great watch. Initially I thought it was just going to be another cheesy teeny horror but it was actually fantastic. The story was clever (albeit kind of done before) with great casting, acting and soundtrack. It was exactly the right mix of comedy moments, suspense and slasher. Harriet Webb's character in particular was hilarious and had some fantastic one-liners. We were gripped right from the start and loved every second. Watched it all in a one go and felt it got better as it went along. Satisfying, gripping, just the right length and very easy to watch. Would definitely recommend.",/review/rw8675959/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,edwardjpatel,10," Surprise show of the year! Great for Halloween.
","I'm so glad to see this series starting to catch some fire. It was a surprise of the year. I caught it late night on the BBC and then went to watch the rest on iPlayer. Wow - there are some snobby, mean-spirited people leaving user reviews on IMDB. ""I sat through all 6 hours but I didn't enjoy it"" smells off to me. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but some people get a kick out of being rude. Maybe it's an older crowd who don't get it? (I'm 34) Lighten up. Anyway, on with the review...",/review/rw8675959/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2022,dippytique,10," Fun and games aboard ship of nightmares!
","I think this is technically a teen show, similar to Sex Ed on Netflix, but it felt quite adult to me. I'm happy to hear it has a second series as it really found its feet by the end, in the most wonderful, surprisingly uplifting of ways. I have been off work sick and this show was surprising soul food! I loved it.",/review/rw8675959/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2022,byzantineiconoclast,8," An underrated mystery with dark humor- not bad at all!
","I started watching with low expectations, especially after reading a couple of reviews in here. I gave it a shot, and sure enough from the second episode in, I was hooked.",/review/rw8675959/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,gemmawilson19,8," Stay in Steerage

20 December 2022,jennythechade,9," More of this please BBC!
","This was a breath of fresh air. I'm hoping the BBC keeps this show. It's not just gory deaths but just the right amount to make it feel real. It's also dry and funny - not over the top comedy which some might expect. Characters are well developed and not written like what we're used to. You know who you're rooting for out the gate but the bad guy is not as clear as you'd think - I didn't see that end of ep 1 coming. Epsiode 5 was insane!! My only critics would be that some of the VFX were a little ropey in parts, but this is a BBC Three show and i'm sure they didn't have the biggest budget in the world. I'm happy to hear it's been renewed as this show has all the potential to go anywhere, and in a time where Netflix rules, and kills off all their shows we fall in love with, maybe it's time to give the little guy more of a chance. More plz.",/review/rw8675959/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,Mark-InTheUK,3," Comedy?
","I watched episode one as it was listed as a comedy. Can anyone point to any time during there first episode where there was anything funny? Please, someone tell me the time I need to go back to, to check for a single laugh. Or is this a post-modern wokery inspired label, where something is listed as something it isn't?",/review/rw8675959/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2023,owenladlow,10," A slasher with brains and heart
","Fun series, great mix of cast, and has some good comedic moments. Oscar Kennedy and Thaddea Graham work so great onscreen together. The premise was fairly original - a murder mystery on a cruise ship - and interesting when you realise a lot of it is based on truth (I had no idea every cruise ship has a morturary on board). The slasher tropes will appeal to a viewer of a certain age and will probably be lost on younger viewers although they will hopefully enjoy the comedy. It's dark comedy, rather than big laugh out loud stuff.",/review/rw8675959/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,hphilpott-56735,10," I loved every second
","I hadn't heard about this until today! I binged the whole thing with my teenage son. We loved it. It was a really good time. It was so funny and scary and surprisingly moving. Very well written and directed. You think it's one thing and then it surprises at every turn! I thought it was going to be a killer duck throughout but it's so much more! We cried at the ending. I'll be watching it again. This won't be for everyone because it's a horror show, doing something very different to the usual TV drudgery and it doesn't take itself too seriously. It was just so refreshing and I want more like it, please. 10/10. Can't wait for a series two!?",/review/rw8675959/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2022,bethleighton,9," Best BBC series on years! Loved this show!
","This show was a real treat and a big surprise. Comedy horror is very hard to pull off, both are very subjective and it's hard to please everyone, but I was very very pleased. It was a breath of fresh air. This is maybe the best bbc three series since In The Flesh. Wreck is like Scream meets Skins or Misfits. Its clearly made by people who love the horror genre and I loved spotting the references.",/review/rw8675959/?ref_=tt_urv

10 October 2022,thayley-27156,10," Loved this! Give me more!
",This show was so good that I had to write a review. I read press reviews but they were all by quite old and dull critics who enjoyed it but didn't obviously get it. I had my own reservations going in - a Brit comedy slasher? Hmm - but it was so great and very surprising. I remember feeling the same way when I first watched Skins. Very different shows but so original and refreshing.,/review/rw8675959/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2022,Linmalut,3," Not great.
","A brother working on a cruise ship looking to find out what has happened to his sister. Murder mystery, everyone is a suspect, no one can get off the ship. Bad management and corrupted staff. Had potential but badly written. Too many unnecessary violence and intimacy scenes just to fill screening time. Not likeable characters, not one nice person on the cruise, apart from the brother. Watched only few episodes enjoyed the first one, then got bored. Definitely not a comedy, more like a horror series for teenagers with homosexual preferences. Shame, because the acting is quite good and the first episode was promising.",/review/rw8675959/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,terrygraham-09774,10," Absolutely Superb
",After a slow start to set the scene I guess the action starts to happen and it develops gruesomely fast. An engaging piece of adventure TV. Just loved it.,/review/rw8675959/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,wesbellamy,9," A fun YA series with slasher elements.
","This is a fun series with slasher elements. I'd say it was more funny than scary, but my friend thought the opposite, so it's doing something right. It was a bit Sex Eductaion, a little bit Scream Queens, so if you like either of those, it's worth a go. It's on BBC Three in the UK which is meant for a younger audience (a bit like MTV or CA), so that should be taken into account and is reflected in the tone. It's silly but gets increasingly dark. There is plenty of nice dialogue and performances and big twists in there to keep you entertained. I'm not sure the first few episodes do the series justice as it finds it's self more around the middle. Some of the sfx weren't the best but it didn't distract too much. I watched the whole thing in one go and regret not making it last. It needed to be 8 eps! Loved it.",/review/rw8675959/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,rossgary-12270,10," Something different
","Wreck has quality & life of its own, the acting is very good & of course Oscar kennedy is sublime as usual, it is funny & Oscar gives it straight faced humour with the right amount of angst, he's amazing to watch, can't wait to see tonight's episode, the duck thing is not only funny it's also eerie, the special effects are superb, the script is different to anything I've heard lately & it's brilliant the way all genders are represented equally, this show could very well go on to achieve cult status, I'll be recommending this series to everyone I know, can't wait for the repeats ha ha! Hope BBC3 produce more comedy horrors like this.",/review/rw8675959/?ref_=tt_urv
