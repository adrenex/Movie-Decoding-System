","When I was fifteen, I used to love listening to the beach boys with my headphones on, cutting out the rest of the world. One of my favourite songs was ""In my Room"" by Brian Wilson. Chasing Mavericks deals with people coming to terms with massive gaps in their lives but somehow focusing on something bigger than themselves to pull through. If you love surfing or the ocean, this movie is for you. Mavericks was brought to world wide attention with Stacey Peralta's film ""Riding Giants"". Jay has lost his father early in life, and has to act as a pseudo parent for his mother who suffers from the breakup. He accidentally discovers that his much older neighbour Frosty is a big wave surfer and so a teacher mentor relationship starts. Frosty, as well, has terrible father issues which continue to plague him. Their relationship develops momentum and gives each of them energy and purpose. The film underlines the choices we can make in life. Everyone has scars and issues to deal with. Do we give up and spiral downwards or do we set big goals (waves) and go after them. Jay plans carefully in his room to conquer his fears and reach his goal. Excellent and heartfelt acting.",/review/rw2864686/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2012,coastdaze,10," Chasing great memories of Santa Cruz life...
","OK, yeah, I rated it excellent because Chasing Mavericks was a 10 for its genre, IMO. Better than I thought it would be - this story of Jay Moriarty was heart-felt and well-acted. Gerard Butler was spot on for guys like that in Santa Cruz at that time. Jonny Weston was surprisingly good, too, portraying Jay Moriarty.",/review/rw2864686/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2012,Soroush_Jozani,10," Chasing Mavericks: A way to reconnect with your soul
","If you want to watch a movie with a fresh point of view on the world and enjoy every minute of it, I highly recommend watching Chasing Mavericks. Chasing Mavericks is the type of movie that will make you feel alive. Not only me, but many of the other people watching it in the theater were so moved that you would actually they would move with the waves in the movie. The movie approaches the theme of love, family and freedom in a very natural way; something that we rarely see in any other movies of this decade. It's very inspirational and motivating, yet it's very real and natural, so you get inspired without being lectured. My hat's off to the person who first came up with the idea of having Gerard Butler play the role of Frosty, because no other actor could pull it off so perfectly. Butler's character is a mentor, father figure and yet, he does seem larger than life, a character that I can call Poseidon, the god of the seas. Aside from that, this is one of those rare movies that resonates father and son relationship, which is really good to see for a change. Grown men, including me, were actually crying when they watched some emotional scenes and this rarely happens. I highly recommend this movie to everyone who wants to reconnect with their emotions and thoughts.",/review/rw2864686/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2012,smccann40,9," Great Movie
","I went and saw this after reading many unfavorable reviews, and now having seen it I can't figure out all the negative attention. Granted, I may be a little biased having grown up surfing in Northern CA, paddling out at many of those spots, and looking up to the big wave chargers such as Jay, but based on entertainment value alone I thought it was great. The acting was solid, footage was incredible, and story never dragged on or lost my attention. The film portrayed a reasonably realistic vibe of Santa Cruz as a high school kid and the often not discussed elements of surfing. I thought it was great that they were able to bring in the real pioneers of Mavs and local shapers.",/review/rw2864686/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2012,surfs_up_55,10," The life of Jay lived out to its fullest leaves the viewer feeling inspired and wanting to jump right into the surfing world
","As a passionate surfer I always look forward to surf films as they are few and far between.The past few takes on surfing by Hollywood have been hit and miss and I think Chasing Mavericks was right on target. The story of Jay is such an inspiring one and it is done quite well as far as surf films go. Similar to the story of Stacy Peralta in Lords of Dogtown, he is an outcast who wants to turn a blind eye to the dark side of those teenage years that many are captured by. Bullies, drugs, violence all play their part in the film, but what is touching is the father son relationship that is developed with Frosty and Jay. Overall it is a great film with lots of heart and few unexpected twists and as in many surf films its fun for us surfers to pick out the cameos of pro surfers and Chasing Mavericks did not disappoint. Peter Mel, Greg Long and tonnes more mentioned in the closing credits. I think this film got surfing right with the escapist attitude and how surfing is more of a love affair with the ocean as opposed to a simple sport. It will leave you inspired and wanting to jump right into the water to Live Like Jay.",/review/rw2864686/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2012,Robalone-Lipps,10," Ecellent movie!!!
","Stunning, nostalgic ocean/beach/surf/coastside visuals, and a watery-emotional story combine to pique any Half Moon Bay romantic to smile, point, shake their head...and gasp with awe. It's, of course, a five-star Flic for me (I am from Half Moon Bay); I'm sure anyone not from Half Moon Bay will have to give it at least a four. In the end, even though it is a love story, it's a surf movie--and a good one. From what I know of surfing, I don't think this tells the whole story, but I think it's a good start. I pray that it opens the door for more stories of this subculture to be told. Bravo to all those that took great risks developing this saga, both before and during.",/review/rw2864686/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2012,shannonquirk,9," Every surfer will appreciate this film. Powerful!
","Fear is real. Even big wave surfers are scared of something. ""Chasing Mavericks"" legitimizes the raw strength of the ocean's largest source of energy. A close relationship to both the surf in Northern California's Pacific and to the man who trains him how to survive its largest beast, this big wave film highlights some of the most interesting parts of big wave surfing psychology. Fear, love, loss... and finding a balance amidst it all. Drop into theaters to see Maverick's on the big screen - that should be reason enough. Period.",/review/rw2864686/?ref_=tt_urv

26 October 2012,Dogdogattack,10," I love this movie!
","It had amazing character relationships and determination to do what you really want to achieve. It made me laugh it made me cry, and most of all it made me inspired. I'm a surfer in general and the story of the main character (Jay) and the reality of the Maverick waves (look it up, they actually do have competitions to surf the waves that are 50 feet high) is just all the move exciting. It's a must see and take the kids, there are some kissing scenes, but they are brief and not graphic. No swearing or anything. Go and learn some awesome life lessons on the pretty much 100% accurate true story. If you look up info about Jay, the real jay you will find that pretty much same story. Very inspirational movie. Go watch it!",/review/rw2864686/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2013,MLDinTN,6," for surfing lovers
","This movie was OK: The story was a little weak, but it had beautiful scenery. If you live near the ocean and go a lot or surf, then I bet you would really like this movie more. It's about a teenager, Jay whose become a good surfer and just happens to live on the same street as, Frosty, the guy whom saved his life and is a world class surfer. Jay makes a deal with him and Frosty agrees to teach him to surf huge waves. So the middle of the film is Jay getting stronger mentally and physically, they even through in a Great White. There is also a girl he likes that finally likes him back at the end. So with just 3 months of training, Jay goes out there with a bunch of other crazy people to ride these 30 foot waves.",/review/rw2864686/?ref_=tt_urv

","Chasing Mavericks is a story of hopes and dreams, a story of a boy who knew what he had to live for. Some of us chase our dreams of going to college, or becoming a football player or a Lawyer. And there are others that dream of chasing the biggest wave, like Jay Moriarity he lived for riding those waves, for pushing himself to become strong enough for the Mavericks.

17 November 2012,DICK STEEL,8," A Nutshell Review: Chasing Mavericks
","Chasing Mavericks is the biographical tale on the late surfer Jay Moriarity (played by Jonny Weston), charting his rise to prominence after caught on camera riding one of the most treacherous waves during the El Nino season in the late 90s when he was just 15 years of age. But this film is not so much of a celebration of the life of someone which was almost like a comet that burned too soon, but rather a celebration of the values the character stood for, in the willingness to invest time, energy and loads of hard work to pursue one's dreams, at whatever the cost.",/review/rw2864686/?ref_=tt_urv

From the incredible inspiring story of Jay Moriarty to the magnificent Maverick waves this movie is enchanting for the whole family.

","""Chasing Mavericks"" is based in the true story of a California surf legend, Jay Moriarty and his mentor (another legend) Frosty Hesson. The movie follows Jay, who learns that one of the biggest waves on earth called the Mavericks isn't a myth and virtually exists in his own back yard. He realizes that they are only a few miles from his home, so he convinces one of his neighbors, the local legend, Frosty Hesson to help him train and prepare him to survive the monster waves. As the two train together they begin to form a remarkable relationship that changes their lives, as Jay and Frosty both learn about much more than surfing. ",/review/rw2864686/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2012,beachbumbound,10," Fantastic movie! Great story. Truly inspirational!
","Whether you surf or not, this movie is inspiring and relative. Do yourself a favor and watch it. Since it's based on a true story, there's instantly an emotional connection to the characters. If you don't like it, that's OK. But if you're not relatively inspired, you must have been watching something different. For surfers, documentaries tend to be the most realistic. This movie proved to be different. The characters portrayed a realistic lifestyle...especially for that time period. This is not a ""Blue Crush"" type of film. There is no doubt you will laugh, cry and be astonished all within this one flick. So as i mentioned before, do yourself a favor and go see it. Cheers!",/review/rw2864686/?ref_=tt_urv

Anything is possible with discipline, dedication and hard work. Even in the most difficult of circumstances, if you try hard enough (or look past the waves), you can find a solution. So all in all, Chasing Mavericks is a positive, spirit-lifting movie.

6 September 2013,Scarecrow-88,7," Chasing Mavericks
","Critically and commercially unsuccessful document on a sweet, hard-working, mature 16-year old kid, Jay (Jonny Weston), saving up his pizza-shop money--unless his rather shifty, struggling single mom (Elizabeth Shue) needs to borrow some--who learns to ride the massive waves of the mythic ""Mavericks"" from a surfing lifer, Frosty Hesson (Gerard Butler, very good here). Jay dedicates himself to learning to surf difficult waves that can pound and drown you if you are unable to hold your breath and power through it all while under water. Frosty is reasonable but demanding, with Jay up to the task. This is really about determination and sheer guts, but, most of all, it is about the love of surfing and leaving your mark in this life. Because Jay is such a class act (as is Frosty, coming from a tough childhood without parental guidance and love due to their departure/absence from his life at an early age), and doesn't just surrender under the pressure (in fact, he perseveres), he achieves exactly what he sets out to do. Holding his breath, navigating the tides, and writing a thesis about the learning process of the surf, Jay makes strides but the challenges provide obstacles he will have to overcome. Jay is smitten with a hot, radiant blonde teen named Kim (Leven Rambin), popular in school while he just isn't. Eventually the two, friends since kids, will acknowledge their love for one another. Jay also has a drug-dealing pal named Blond (Devin Crittenden), the buddy responsible for teaching him how to surf (the two skateboard empty pools, too). Jay bonds with Frosty and Frosty's lovely family, including the missus, Brenda (Abigail Spencer). The story, based on real events, is all about the love and lifestyle built around surfing, stretching the limits and achieving your dreams. When Frosty suffers a devastating loss, Jay is his pillar of strength, paddling out to find the grieving mentor under an alcoholic duress. There are some smart-aleck verbal bullies always heckling Jay but cannot hold a candle to the kid when surfing the waves. The approach to the story is straight-forward and acted competently. Jay accomplished a lot in his mere 22 years on this earth (his life was cut short by a tragedy ""free diving""), and those who knew him (for the most part; even the bullies and those in school that ignored him, eventually come to admire and respect him) were grateful to have been a part of that short life. Butler took a break from the usual brash, loud, boisterous, cocky, and galvanizing parts for this thoughtful, wise, reserved, and caring role as a father figure for a teenager who desperately needed one. Spencer, fashioned in hippie garb, with a soft voice and delicate approach to confronting/addressing issues (mostly regarding Jay) to her husband, is so captivatingly beautiful. Shue, who comes and goes in the film, mostly presented as irresponsible and unrefined, has a nice moment at the end when it is Jay's birthday, bestowing a gift to her son, while also paying him back borrowed money (thanks to a promotion; she also improves her life by taking responsibility for her actions) Weston has a cherubic quality to him, and his handling of people (even when bullies antagonize him) says a great deal about his character. Surfing, as you'd expect, is treated as an almost spiritual event, the ride of the waves the climax of the quest resulting from passionate labor and intense training.",/review/rw2864686/?ref_=tt_urv
