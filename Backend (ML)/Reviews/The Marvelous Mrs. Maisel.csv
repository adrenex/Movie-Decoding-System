3 July 2021,alessatziolis,6," No idea why ginny is the main character
","If this whole show would have been about Georgia it would most likely be a 10/10. Street smart and outwitting them all. She has such depth to her character, which ginny, the lead, is missing entirely.",/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2021,Imme-van-Gorp,7," Very overly dramatic and cringeworthy, but somehow never really boring and even quite entertaining.
",Season One: 7/10,/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2021,asazii,7," Decent show other than Ginny's annoying behaviour.
","Overall I liked the show. However, I found Ginny to be incredibly annoying with her spoiled and privileged behaviour. She is downright rude to her friends and mom. Her character has a lot of maturing to do.",/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2021,zigktuqs,7," Ginnys behaviour really bothered me
","I'm not sure if this was the intention of the show for Ginny to come off this way but I feel half the time i love her and the other half I find her incredibly annoying. The way she treats her mom, and always sees herself as the victim in everything really bothers me. She thinks every time someone doesn't agree with her that's is either racist or they are in the wrong. She's closed minded while also being open minded and seems to have this idea that everyone else's life aside from her own is perfect. She's self centred and immature but thinks she's the opposite.",/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2021,vgibson1590-963-354026,10," Great watch
","This season was a really great watch. I couldn't stop. I binged all 10 episodes the same day lol. The originality of the characters and their charm really pull you in and get you invested. Don't listen to the crazy Taylor Swift fans getting mad over one single line in the whole show of 10 episodes. I love T Swift as much as the next person but geez, calm down.",/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2021,Bartlomiej0404,6," it wasn't that bad but giving it a ten!?
","Don't get me wrong, this show is not terrible but 10 and 9? You guys are really comparing that show to a level of Breaking bad/Chernobyl and other ten worthy shows? Most of the time this show is filled out with cringy scenes and doesn't make any sense (Cynthia just breaking into the office randomly? Georgia not facing any consequences after killing her two husbands and being this master criminal? There is so much stuff that doesn't make sense that I would spend 3 hours just writing them down here), the flashbacks were the worst I've ever seen, the show is taking us 15 years back but the home looks modern? People also said that this show pretty accurately portrays teenage life and problems(?) but it's not true at all. I believe that to some sort of audience it's a pretty good show but a 10?. If you want to watch a show that makes you pause it every 5 minutes because that you can't handle this amount of cringe, go ahead and watch it.",/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2021,laurhartwick,8," Looking forward to season two!
","This show has a very entertaining cast. The teenage characters are pretty realistic and have good chemistry, especially the four girls-it reminds me a lot of being young and having fun with my girlfriends. I could do with less sexualization of teenagers, but understand the show is being realistic about the lives of teens.",/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2021,beano4400,7," Yes and no
","This is such a good show. It's a great one for parents and teens to watch together.
The Virginia character however is absolutely exhausting... I am so sick of watching her grump through every scene. I think if she rolled her eyes one more time I might have thrown the remote at my screen.
It's a shame because other than that it's a really good programme.",/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2021,dreamingwolf-01253,9," I liked it
",I really like it. Its more realistic than most shows. People in some of these reviews want fantasy but to be honest this show touches base on how teenagers really are these days.,/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2021,lisannemees,5," Ginny's character is unlikeable
","I absolutely love the Georgia character and would have loved if the show focused more on her teen years, but ginny is very annoying. Ginny is always playing the victim and her actions of juggling two boys, making everything about race and being so ungrateful to her mother. This makes the show for me unlikeable. Overall the show has a decent plot typical to a romcom type of serie.",/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2021,michroberto,7," Not at all what I was expecting (in a good way).
","This show surprised me. It's more than just a teen drama. I appreciate the racially mixed casting and the delving into issues faced by biracial kids. All of the comparisons to Gilmore Girls are purely superficial and take away from the darkness that I felt this show did very well. I think the casting was really well done. I say kudos to the casting of the ""teen"" actors. They all looked pretty young (they looked 20 instead of 25-30 like usual in these shows).",/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2021,XilovepepsiX,5," Ginny was very ungrateful
","Ginny was very ungrateful and rude to her mom!!.
Come on the woman did everything for her and at the end she ran away??? Tf??? üòê.
I really don't get why she was upset because she's basically the replica of Georgia",/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv

","THE TWISTS, THE DRAMA.
Heartfelt, extra dramatic, wholesome and twisty. What a show. Teenage drama mixed in with some really provocative themes, important commentary, intricately bizarre story lines and some truly wonky characters. A mother-daugther story that is far beyond their own relationship which is born out of a stereotypical ""free spirit"" mom on the run storyline. It's chaotic in a wonderful way. Bless. waiting for a second season.",/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2021,jzzity-581-377154,7," Started Strong. Still want a next season

1 March 2021,vegas_lights,10," I loved this show!
","It's such a shame to see a great show take a hit at ratings because of cancel culture. So, to anyone reading this unsure wether to give it a go, if you enjoy an easy watch with great storylines and romance, I'd definitely say yes. I'd say the target audience is teens/YA but I'm pushing 30yo and LOVED it! The ratings have taken a hit due to a Taylor Swift comment and from someone who loves Taylor's music it's ridiculous that no one can mention ANYTHING anymore without it offending someone. Definitely recommend this series, hoping for s2!!",/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,chenrybausmaniv,8," Surprisingly humanizing.
","I didnt expect much from this show. I anticipated a very high school level drama with superficial problems and i got anything but... this show has layers.... the characters have layers. Whoever designed this show has some untapped talent. As the story progresses you start to justify actions you would never make, and root for people because they deserve a chance and a change at life. This show is POWERFUL. Netflix would be stupid to let this gem fall away.",/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,irishkate-86064,," Love the show but hate Ginny
","I really enjoy this show but to tolerate it I had to fast forward through the parts with Ginny. I couldn't watch scenes with her in it. She is the worst person in a tv series. She is just a negative angry teenager. She never smiles and even when she does it looks angry. She is so self consumed that she doesn't realise everything her mum has done for her to care for and protect her. I love Georgia, Austin and Joe. They are the only tolerable characters on the show. So hopefully Ginny decides to run away again and never come back!!!! So I don't have to look at her angry face and hear her whiny voice anymore.",/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2023,mhtannous,10," Second Season even better than the first.
","I'm giving it a ten. In the days of streaming with millions of low quality options, I feel it's rare for a second season to deliver this well.",/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv

1 March 2021,jdarden-90303,10," As a man...
","Can't believe I'm reviewing this show. But seeing all the negative reviews over a Taylor Swift comment is pretty ridiculous. Great show and if the people that were so quick to judge would give the show a chance they would see that. Really like Georgia as a character and overall just great writing. Can't believe all the bad reviews, just petty and hypocritical.",/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2021,lil_skittle22,9," just because TSwift hates it. Doesn't. Make. It. Bad.
","The show is super adorable! Have we seen it before? yes. But, what haven't we seen before? Georgia is hilarious and how can you hate anything with Scott Porter in it? The ONLY reason people hate it is because Taylor Swift made ONE comment about it. Unfortunately when you're famous your life Is in the open. Grow up and ignore one comment. The show is about inclusion and the characters are adorable.",/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2021,KkonaW,2," might take a few days to finish an episode if you are not used to secondhand embarrassment
","Characters are often overacted, some to the point of being clowny. They are trying too hard to make it seems like there are teenagers in this show.",/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2021,rgknnfwk,10," Cancel culture is TOXIC
",Why are these Taylor swift fans trying to ruin a good show for everyone by ruining its name and chatting nonsense in the reviews WATCH THE SHOW BEFORE U REVIEW ITT!!,/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2021,arod_85,8," Surprisingly Great
","I just finished Firefly Lane on Netflix and absolutely loved it. I binged the series in a few days and Netflix kept recommending Ginny & Georgia. I kept opting out because I was expecting a cheesy comedy with some life lessons thrown in. Something like a modern and diverse ""Full House""or ""Boy Meets World"". I finally gave in and figured I'd give it a chance. I was pleasantly surprised by this show and binged it in a few days (sensing a trend here). It has a lot going on. It can't decide if it wants to be Gilmore girls, Euphoria, Desperate Housewives or Firefly lane. Despite so many plot lines, I absolutely loved this show. Kudos to Netflix because this is another solid show that I am saddened to have to wait for a season two. The cast is great (Ginny does get annoying after awhile, but she is a teen and that can be expected). The mother and daughter duo works brilliantly and both actresses knock it out of the park. The entire cast does. Georgia is brilliantly written; she has done some horrible things in life but I find myself rooting for her happiness. Please keep up with this formula, Netflix, because you have been doing a great job with Firefly Lane and even better with Ginny & Georgia!",/review/rw6645236/?ref_=tt_urv
