7 May 2019,LovesMyGarden,3," The devil is in the details
","PLEASE do something about the characters' hair and makeup. It's distracting to watch a period piece (100 years ago?) with 2019 hair, makeup and wardrobe. You can do better.",/review/rw2943978/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2019,ronalamont-91472,4," Can't get past inaccurate hair/make-up/costumes, dialogue & sets
","As I now read that others have had the same problems with the staging of this series as I have, I feel compelled to give it a low rating.
I love ""family values"" programming and I am so disappointed not to be able to get behind this series I've come to very late.... but I can't.
Even the dialogue and some action by some characters are too modern so it completely ruins it for me. I'm a costume designer and make-up artist for TV and commercials and it's truly unforgivable in my opinion.
The producers need to visit the set of ""Murdoch Mysteries"" for a bit of ""movie"" authenticity.",/review/rw2943978/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2014,sdw61,10," FINALLY a Great Family Series Again!
","I was beginning to think family type series were truly a thing of the past, but when the series, ""When Calls the Heart"" finally began, I found a show that resembles the type of shows from the past that I still love! Thank you, Hallmark for bringing a a show to the 21st century with values of the past. It is decent, heart-warming, and one you look forward to seeing on a weekly basis, just like shows from the 70's and 80's. My family and I have gotten to the point that the only television series we enjoy watching is by purchasing DVD's of shows from the past like the ""Waltons"", ""Little House on the Prarie"", or ""Anne of Green Gables"" and watching them for hour long entertainment.

9 March 2014,adnil-2,10," Love this show!

7 March 2014,ypuskinsan,8," I am in love with Hallmark series
","Last year Hallmark released a very good series, CEDAR'S COVE. And i felt in love with the series. Though many of the TV junkies might not enjoy it and called it a clich√©s, it was a great series for me. So that's how my affair with Hallmark began.",/review/rw2943978/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2018,sharonwong1,1," great potential never achieved
","It is really heartbreaking to see how a wonderful series began with a promising first season, full of interesting and believable characters, engaging plots, etc. It took a plunge in Season 2 where the integrity of the story and context seemed to be traded for Hallmark's ""plastic doll"" asthetic. From here on, although Season 3 redeemed the series for a while with the development of Pastor Frank, Cody, and Rosemary and Lee. Jack and Elizabeth's relationship is challenged but develops in a substantial way. Season 4 was going well until ""My Heart Will Go On"" which was ironically one of the best episodes of the season, but also the beginning of the undoing of the series as a whole. The contrived nature of the turn of the events, seemed forced and unrealistic, but myself, and I think most of the audience being caught up in the emotions of the episode, was not in a state of mind to critically understand that this was the beginning of the end. Where our suspension of disbelief is challenged gradually, beginning with unrealistic timing of events, then gradually to unrealistic character traits like the odd ""perfection"" of Elizabeth, children, Abigail... Gowen not suffering any consequences for his crimes, Pastor Frank's limited appearance in Season 4 and 5 and gradual disappearance, ""rotating door"" characters introduced in order to promote other Hallmark series but do not add to the development of the series quality as a whole. I could go on... but ultimately, the producers' choice to eventually kill off the character of Jack was done in such a forced manner, that it has tainted the rest of the rest of the series. I would advise those watching the first season to not continue, and to think of the first season as a stand-alone. Continuing would only lead to disappointment and dashed hopes.",/review/rw2943978/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2017,maryanne111,6," They ruined the atmosphere of the frontier town.
","I really loved the first season of this show. It was very atmospheric, costumes were great and all the faces were naturally beautiful. Then suddenly all the women look like they're just out of a beauty salon. Lots of makeup, crispy clean and new clothes, fancy Hollywood hairstyles. There's no way pioneer women looked like that. It's so disappointing they ruined the atmosphere of the frontier town.",/review/rw2943978/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2021,musicalfreakgurl,," Some reviews are just wrong
",I've read review after review of this show blaming the producers and writers for the ending of season five when it was the actors choice to LEAVE THE SHOW. They had no choice but to kill his character off. A recast would've been just stupid. This isn't a soap opera. Now to WHY you should ACTUALLY watch the show.,/review/rw2943978/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2018,tishco,3," Plastic, stilted and totally ruined

9 March 2014,Joziesjewelry,10," Saturday nights can't get here fast enough!
","I am officially a When Calls the Heart addict! I can't get enough. I watch nearly everything on the Hallmark Channel, so last fall when they showed the movie that starred Stephen Amell and Maggie Grace I, of course, watched it & fell in love! I then got all of the books by Janette Oke & read them practically without putting them down! (Yes, I do work & it really interfered! LOL) I eagerly anticipated the series as they advertised it for what seemed like forever. This is a series that has struck a chord in my heart that's long been unfulfilled. I have always been a fan of Little House on the Prairie, The Walton's and the Love Comes Softly series. I wish I lived in those times when life was much more simple and people really did love their neighbor. This new series, When Calls the Heart, is what I've been wanting for a long time - good family programming that I don't have to censor or watch it when others aren't around because I'm ashamed of it's content. This is a time when men were chivalrous, women were strong and children did as they were told out of respect for their elders. It's such a nice change from what we see on other programs that are on right now. I'm praying that Hallmark & other channels realize that there are people out there longing for this kind of programming. I'll be so heartbroken if this doesn't get a second season. So, for now, I'm loving me some clean romance between the pretty schoolteacher Elizabeth & the handsome gentleman, Jack. Love that smile & the red Mountie jacket! Loving Lori Laughlin too - she's always been great!",/review/rw2943978/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2021,PeriodDramaFan88,3," Self destructed in Season 8
","This show was pretty good for the first 7 Season. I could close my eyes on the historic inaccuracies and the overacting of some characters for the feel good stories I could sit down and watch with my whole family. Unfortunately, Season 8 took everything good about this show and completely destroyed it. Gone are the feel good stories instead you are feeling like throwing up after every episode. In light of how Season 8 ended I am done with this show. There really is no going back from the disaster that this show has become.",/review/rw2943978/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2018,Rilian_Puddleglum,," Just pull up your hair already!
","I used to love Jeanette Oke's books. I love historical fiction. But I hate cheap movies and shallow acting. I got into the series for Season 1, but Season 2 is driving me crazy. Their loose wavy hair and highlights that suddenly everyone wears is inaccurate and awfully inconvenient- you can't cook or do chores with hair in your face. The clothing went wrong as well. The fake eyelashes. The makeup. The shallow stories. All causing me to fast-forward through most of the show to see what happens.
Why doesn't Jack ever wear his Mounty uniform anymore?
Rosemary is annoying as hell, I do hope she leaves.
The fake love interests that are supposed to be conflicting but are not convincing at all just need to go away.
As usual, I need to learn to turn off the TV and go back to reading.",/review/rw2943978/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2021,youngandrestless12345,1," Only watch up to Season 7
",Season 8 was a manic roller-coaster that absolutely went OFF THE RAILS as far as story. Hallmark did a complete 180 flip and changed the whole focus of the storylines. This was obviously done all for Ratings. Like watching the Twilight Zone hit Hope Valleyand I am most certainly not the only person who feels this way.,/review/rw2943978/?ref_=tt_urv

","This tv show is like none other. It's wholesome, heart warming, and even has great cliff hangers. The last few seasons have been a little bumpy, but the cast and crew have been able to pull it off. I would recommend this show to anyone.",/review/rw2943978/?ref_=tt_urv

16 March 2014,doug2go,10," One of the 4 Best shows on TV
","Larry Levinson is the master at producing Romance movies and now a continuing series I have on my can't miss list. The casting is perfect and story line moves. It is predictable - but if you are a Leo - you don't like bad romantic surprises - Larry Levinson shows don't have bad romantic surprises. I look forward to NCIS,Chicago Fire, Blue bloods and When calls the Heart - which puts it in the rarefied air of top TV programing in my book. If you haven't watched this show before - catch up "" On Demand' with previous shows and you will see the snail pace romance that evolves by the show leads - it is prefect program timing - my wife and I love it.",/review/rw2943978/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2020,kness23,10," I love it but it makes me crazy....
",This show is so sweet and heartwarming but also so very silly. I love all the characters and the premise. The wardrobe and hair and makeup are so wrong but I admit they look really good. The town is way to pretty and clean. This is supposed to be Western Canada and they are always heading off to Hamilton which would be at least 6 days away by train. Why would the telephone head office be in San Francisco? Thats another country. What happened to Rip the dog?Why are they eating food like lasagna and spaghetti ? Way too sophisticated and urban for small town Canada..Wouldn't women ride sidesaddle? Also women would not enter a saloon. Speaking of saloon where are the prostitutes? Its a mining town !!!! Why are there no Asians? Asians built Canada's railroads and had a huge presence in our small towns.Anyway enough of the history lesson.. Its a guilty pleasure and I love it in spite of how silly it is.,/review/rw2943978/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2021,Lily-32,1," A sinking ship...
","The show has always struggled with making sense at times. Some of the decisions were just dumb in story lines. People do horrible things but all is forgiven the next episode and they do awful things again. But it managed to float a bit. Until they killed off Jack. Now I know the actor wanted to leave so that wasn't the problem. It was HOW they decided to do it. He survives the war but dies in training? And it just got worse from there. Several times I thought they'd redeem. And every time I should've known better. So, peace out. I'm sure it'll run for many years to come. But I'm not wasting my time.",/review/rw2943978/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wow! Amazing...I stumbled upon the TV movie by accident and from there came to know of the series. Though the lead in the series are different from the TV movie , I adored the young Elizabeth Thatcher and Mountie Edward. I didn't think I would fall in love with the series...but I did. Based on Janette Oke's novel (Where courage calls) , the series is about Elizabeth Thatcher who leaves behind her wealthy background to travel to coal valley to be a teacher. The town that is grieving a recent coal mining accident leaving many of her pupil orphan. While she teaches her pupil life teaches lessons to her. How she embraces her new community and works for them is inspiring...and then there is the Handsome Mounty Jack Thornton...sweet romance. ",/review/rw2943978/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2020,MyContribution,5," Entertaining, but lacks continuity and credibility
","I've seen 6 seasons of this Hallmark series. Individual episodes are entertaining, but the series as a whole is just frustrating. It is often illogical and inconsistent. Both characters and roles (such as pastor, sheriff, mayor) come and go. For a town hailed for its community spirit, it is puzzling that characters and roles that are at once central to the town later just disappear.",/review/rw2943978/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2018,maximumbets,1," Perfectly awful!
","The people on this show are too perfect to be believable in this time period in this setting Perfect teeth, perfectly highlighted hair, perfectly shaped eyebrows, pierced ears. The clothes are too clean, the language too good for a 1900's coal mining town. Also, it seems about as Canadian as stars and stripes.",/review/rw2943978/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2014,sree-howlett,10," preview! no spoiler
","One of the shows I'm looking forward to, this year. The costumes look grand, the sets look fantastic and a promising cast. Together they seem to create this feel of authenticity of greater times, classic times. It's unbelievable how I was convinced by just the working stills and screen shots of the show available here at IMDb. I love history and it is only natural for me to like ""When Calls The Heart"" as it is based on another time. To be honest, it was an accident that I found this show because I was looking for Johannah Newmarch's work/filmography and bumped onto this show at the hallmark channel website I think. And I'm oh so glad that I did. Not only Johannah Newmarch, the cast includes a lot of lovely actresses as well. Cannot wait to watch!",/review/rw2943978/?ref_=tt_urv
