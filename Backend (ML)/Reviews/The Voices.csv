5 March 2015,brchthethird,8," Ryan Reynolds is a Norman Bates for the 21st century
","For some reason Ryan Reynolds hasn't really taken off as a movie star, but I can't really see why. He has the good looks and he has a likable personality. Maybe it has to do with GREEN LANTERN? (not the best movie, but I still enjoyed it). Well, this time teamed up with director Marjane Satrapi (PERSEPOLIS) in her English-language debut, Ryan Reynolds delivers what is probably the best performance of his career. He plays Jerry, a rather unassuming (but subtly creepy) guy who works at a faucet and fixture warehouse in a small town. Everything seems alright on the surface, but deep inside Jerry has some problems. Aside from a troubled childhood, he also hears voices inside his head, and these voices tell him to do things...bad things. I'll just say that for those looking for a lighthearted comedy, this isn't it. THE VOICES goes to some pretty dark places, but manages to balance the tone fairly evenly between comedy and shock, of which there is plenty. But most importantly, Jerry is a guy you actually care about. Despite his...issues, he really wants to do the right thing and live a normal life. Too bad that his cat Mr. Whiskers is more influential than his goodhearted dog Bosco. Across the board, all of the performances were excellent. You have Anna Kendrick and Gemma Arterton who play a couple of Jerry's coworkers, and Jacki Weaver plays his court-appointed psychiatrist. They could have been developed a little more, but this is mostly Ryan Reynold's show and boy does he deliver! From a technical standpoint, I thought the cinematography and production design lent a sort of fairy-tale quality to the film, and the color scheme which had a lot of pinks and oranges provided a nice contrast with dark subject material. As far as the gory stuff is concerned, they don't show a whole lot, instead opting for some pretty gruesome sound design. Often the power of suggestion is more effective than actually showing violent acts. And, in this case, it actually works in the film's favor because Jerry can remain just as likable when you don't actually see him kill people most of the time. If there's any weaknesses to the film, it's that it doesn't really try anything new or revolutionary in its approach to the whole ""loveable serial killer"" thing. Almost nothing that happens in this movie is unpredictable in some way, with one big exception which I'll leave for you to experience on your own should you choose to watch this. Overall I enjoyed this a lot, mainly because I'm drawn to oddball films like this, but also because I haven't seen Ryan Reynolds this good in, well, forever. For lovers of dark comedies, I'd say THE VOICES is a must-see.",/review/rw3132535/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2016,Floated2,9," Unusual take on dark comedies
","The voices is another lower independent film starring Reynolds. In the film, he truly captures the idea that Jerry is a man forced down a road of violence by things that he cannot control. He is a unique serial killer in that he so wants normalcy, companionship and happiness. The joy in Reynolds' eyes when he is shown human kindness by other co- workers (Gemma Arterton & Anna Kendrick) is as key to this performance as the insanity that other actors would have focused on and turned into scenery chewing. Reynolds uses his natural charm to great effect here. The voices has some similarities with American Psycho with Christian Bale, as both characters have some similar traits. Or an older film which has been somewhat forgotten is the Cable Guy starring Jim Carrey. Overall, the Voices is not a film for everyone and can be easily seen as unstable for those expecting different results. It is entertaining throughout and offers some twists.",/review/rw3132535/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2015,storm_mica,8," Very dark, bitter-sweet journey
","I must admit I loved parts of this movie and other parts I hated; which is not to say they were bad, I simply didn't like some parts because of the emotions they brought to the surface. The voices is a very dark comedy; there were parts which were completely laugh out loud funny (eg: many of mister whiskers' lines) and other parts were tragically serious.

31 December 2014,kosmasp,10," I can hear them too
","Well only those in the movie that is of course. Not reading about them or the movie as is my usual procedure, for better or worse, before watching a movie, proved good for this one. To say this was a surprise would be an understatement, even though we got told that the movie was received very well in other cities where the Festival went before coming to our town. A promise kept in that case.",/review/rw3132535/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2015,sforrester-3,8," I liked it.
","I wasn't expecting a great deal from this but was pleasantly surprised. I do like Ryan Reynolds and I think he played this perfectly, giving the slightly comedic element whilst still portraying someone suffering from extreme mental health problems. Showing us the difference between the medicated and unmedicated character was well done and although there were one or two points I would question, overall the balance was handled well. I liked that the character had a well thought out back story and his desire to be ""normal"" as well as the torture that he couldn't be really came across. I would give this one a go if you enjoy quirky films with a bit of an edge.",/review/rw3132535/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2015,scurvytoon,10," The cat made me write this review

6 December 2018,nogodnomasters,6," MY CAT MADE ME DO IT
","Jerry (Ryan Reynolds) works in a small town factory. He is an outsider to the group, but well liked. He also hears voices, mostly from his pets, when he is off his medication. Jerry likes the voices and prefers to be off of his meds. Jerry likes Fiona (Gemma Arterton) who doesn't return the love. Jerry however is like by Lisa (Anna Kendrick) which would have been my first choice.",/review/rw3132535/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2015,SnoopyStyle,6," black comedy with no big laughs
",Jerry (Ryan Reynolds) is a seemingly happy guy in the town of Milton. Dr. Warren (Jacki Weaver) is his court-appointed psychiatrist. He likes Fiona (Gemma Arterton) from work but she doesn't like him back. The problem is that he sees things and hear voices from animals. He's delusionally obsessed with Fiona but Lisa (Anna Kendrick) is the one who actually likes him.,/review/rw3132535/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2015,stephendaxter,9," A very dark film with plenty of hilarious comedy
","The Voices is a dark comedy starring Ryan Reynolds who begins to hear voices through both his cat and dog who try to persuade him to do certain good or not so good things. I really didn't know what to expect before seeing this film but boy was i pleasantly surprised by what i saw. One thing this film does really well is that when it turns dark, it turns really dark really fast and then it somehow manages to instantly lighten the mood and make you laugh. The comedic elements in this film worked really well and got me to laugh pretty much every time and for a film that gets so dark and depressing at multiple times it is a very good accomplishment.

8 February 2015,bbickley13-921-58664,7," One of the most warped dark comedies I've seen

6 December 2015,Unluckymagpie,8," An underrated film with a strong performance from Reynolds.
","A truly underrated film. It has a brilliant performance from Ryan Reynolds, in a role that is pretty unusual for him, and allows him to get out of his typical action stereotype, as he really is a great comedic and dramatic actor, when paired with the right script.

31 August 2018,dennismonares510,8," Hahahaha, why not more love?
","This movie was awesome! I even watch past the beginning credits hoping Jerry would get out and fill up some more fridges. Well done movie, good acting, very original and even has jesus making a guest appearance at the end.",/review/rw3132535/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2016,caligamy,9," Not so sure about the comedy part but..
","This movie came up on shuffle in Hulu and I thought.. ""a comedy? OK.. never heard of this movie."" Few minutes into it I was getting bored and something about the cleanness of everything seemed really off and I was completely missing the humor part. And then.. things got crazy, literally. An accidental(?) stabbing here, beheading there, arguments with the cat and dog.. and suddenly I couldn't stop watching it. ",/review/rw3132535/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2021,bdear-81616,8," Disturbing
","I have a super dark sense of humor; but the movie being under ""comedy"" was totally incorrect. This movie is about a mentally ill - like not ha ha funny; like deeply mentally ill person. The movie was way more sad than anything. I watched the whole thing to see how it played out. I definitely will never forget this one.",/review/rw3132535/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2021,jfgibson73,6," Very dark character study
","This was well worth a watch. It is a dark comedy, so there is some messed up stuff going on. Suffice to say that we have an unreliable narrator for most of the run time. Ryan is good, of course. It has Anna Kendrick, who gets some memorable moments. It lost a little steam in the third act, and I think it's because by that point, we feel like the story doesn't really have anywhere to go. I would have liked a different resolution, also. Other than that, it was fine.",/review/rw3132535/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2015,AudioFileZ,4," A Comedy Whose Darkness Too Often Exceeded It's Humor
","While there's sure to be those who find a kind of brilliant mixture of ""uber-dark"" comedy here it's simply hard to say more will than won't. Perhaps it's the fact that serial killing at the hand of a schizophrenic psychopath whose cat tells him to murder isn't, under any circumstance, funny.",/review/rw3132535/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2020,deloudelouvain,9," Ryan Reynolds nailed it here, very enjoyable movie, much better than expected.
","To be honest I didn't have high expectations for this movie as Ryan Reynolds isn't my favorite actor but credit where credit is due he nailed it here, in fact I thought this was his best performance yet. To my surprise he did all the voice-overs, I would never have guessed that (I even waited for the end credits to clarify who did the voices for Mr. Whiskers, Bosco (voice), the deer and the bunny monkey). The conversations between him, his cat and dog were hilarious, much better than the usual speaking animals we sometimes get. The story itself was also very good, nothing beats a good story about a schizophrenic. It was interesting to follow, with some good humorous moments and some bloody gory parts. It's a dark comedy, one of the better ones if you want my opinion. Anna Kendrick and Gemma Arterton were the eye candy of this movie, both have a funny bone and added something special to this comedy. So if you like to wander in the mind of a schizophrenic combined with some humor The Voices will definitely suit you. I had a lot of fun watching this movie and will for sure watch it again in the future.",/review/rw3132535/?ref_=tt_urv

21 April 2015,blob-93964,5," What the hell did I just watch?!?!
",I rated this film a 5 but in all honesty I have no idea how to rate this film. This is a seriously dark and disturbing movie which delves into the mind of a deranged serial killer. What disturbs me equally as much is the way this film is marketed and advertised. It's made to look more like a comedy but I can assure you that there is nothing funny about this movie. It's Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer on Ecstasy. There is nothing enjoyable about this film. It's very well made and I can believe that this is how someone with this kind of mental illness sees the world and lives their life but don't be fooled but the sugar coating given to the poster and the trailer.,/review/rw3132535/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2015,leonblackwood,4," Watchable but completely bonkers. 4/10
","Review: What a crazy movie! The storyline is completely mad but funny, in a weird type of way and it's really unpredictable. Its about a psychopathic man called Jerry who works in a bathtub factory and takes a fancy to one of his work colleagues. After a whole, he plucks up the courage to ask the girl out but she's not really keen on him. When she finally agrees to go out with him on a date, he goes home and he talks to his cat and dog about how he should impress her. The cat is a vicious, mean animal who gets Jerry to do bad things but the dog has a kind heart and he tries to guide him down the correct path. His psychiatrist prescribes him pills so he doesn't hear the voices but the drugs make him quite depressed so he doesn't take them. When he goes to meet his date at a restaurant, he ends up sitting there all night waiting for her to turn up but she decides to go to a Karaoke bar with her friends instead. On the way home he bumps into her in the street and she asks for some help because her car has broken down. He then gives her a lift home and they end up in a car accident because a deer steps in the middle of the road. After taking the deer's life, because the deer told him to, the girl makes a run for her life and Jerry mistakingly takes her life after slipping in the woods. From there the movie goes completely crazy because he goes on a killing spree, with the help of his talking pets. His victims heads end up in his fridge and they also talk to him so he's getting different advice from everyone, which sends him mad. Its hard to say if I enjoyed this movie because the storyline is totally out there. Ryan Reynolds plays the psychopathic role quite well, along with the geeky innocent side to the character. It does go a bit too far after a while because his victims were getting murdered for silly reasons and the dance scene at the end really didn't make any sense. Maybe he found his happy place! Anyway, it's worth a watch just for its warped humour and his psychotic behaviour but you do have do be in the right frame of mind to enjoy it. Watchable but strange!",/review/rw3132535/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2021,joiningjt,10," Extremely Underrated film, phenomenal performance by Ryan Reynolds!! Brilliant!!
","Its another film that people just didnt get, actually some did but it should have been a hit. I actually would have loved to see a sequel it easily could be accomplished. Anyway Ryan Reynolds is an example of what people call a God given talent, I'm agnostic but let's just use that description. He has a comedic edge even when dramatic and it's a rare find. The only actor I can compare him to is Cary grant. The looks, charm, spontaneous humor and wit. And above all charisma!! It shines here as he makes you like and get to know his character who is suffering from a mental disorder or multiple disorders yet seems normal at times. The dark humor just adds to the beauty of this film. But make no mistake it's all Ryan Reynolds!! BRILLIANT!!!",/review/rw3132535/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2014,movie-op,9," Darkly hilarious
","Everyone's favorite director/graphic novelist Marjane Satrapi worked from someone else's material for the first time in The Voices, a dark, weirdly funny story that will appeal to those who enjoyed 2012's genre-bending Cabin in the Woods. ",/review/rw3132535/?ref_=tt_urv
