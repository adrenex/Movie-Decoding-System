20 September 2011,cosmo_tiger,," A very surprisingly good suspense movie that deserves to be watched. Very neat idea that is both exciting and tense. I say A-
","""People come together for a reason Mary, doesn't matter how."" After starting divorce proceedings against her husband Mary (Leferve) starts a new life in a new apartment. After a series of phone calls from a woman they begin to talk about their situations. When the woman acts on an off-handed remark by Mary she begins to rethink the friendship. When people she knows start to disappear she doesn't know how to make it stop. 90% of the way you feel about a movie, I think, has to do with your expectations going in. Movies like ""Bridesmaids"" with all the hype can really let you down after it's talked up as much as it was. This one is the total opposite. Never hearing of this the trailer seemed interesting so I watched it. I was blown away. A very neat (although not original) idea. Think a suspense version of the ""Lake House"". I don't want to give anymore away so I will end this, but this is a surprisingly good must see. I really liked this movie. Overall, a very tense and exciting suspense that deserves more of an audience that I'm sure it will get. Watch this! I give it an A-.",/review/rw2546192/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2014,bowmanblue,7," Nice little horror/thriller (probably not for everyone though)
","I had very little expectations from this film. It didn't look like it had much of a budget and no actors that I'd heard of (okay, so I sort of recognised the main woman from Twilight, but that was about it). However, in this case, less is slightly more (or at least slightly more than the average dross that infests modern horror films).",/review/rw2546192/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2012,nitzanhavoc,8," Excellent and well made!!! Another proof that reviewers here cannot be trusted. Perhaps the most underrated Horror film in history.
","So it's official, I either don't understand this site, or I don't understand the way people who vote/rate here think. The Caller just might be the most underrated Horror film of 2011, or even ever! So please let me start by recommending that you don't let yourself miss out on it, as you could easily find one million films that would be less fun to watch.",/review/rw2546192/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2011,hopla68,," Excellent chiller, subtle and very scary.
","After having seen thousands of films, most of them horror, one tends to get a little jaded. Especially with the turn the genre took to torture porn ( with saw on the very end of the positive side of the spectrum and films like hostel on the very negative part) i got a bit tired of the whole circus.",/review/rw2546192/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2013,hnt_dnl,9," Twisty, well-acted, psychological horror tale
","THE CALLER (2011) is a rare thinking person's horror film. They really don't make 'em like this anymore! While there are many elements that on the surface the viewer have seen in many other films, it's what's underneath that counts. This film takes several previously used elements and molds them into a profound, scary horror film that I think will steadily gain ground over the years.",/review/rw2546192/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2011,nisusdominus,10," Spoiler! There are two themes in this movie!
","For all the negative reviews I've read from reviewers on this movie, I am very inclined to clarify one thing: There are two premises here. These you will see as the plot develops. The first premise is a quantum time loop. The movie begins with this premise. The second premise is psychological. This premise is most clearly seen at the end - and when you look at the plot in retrospect, it's entirely clear that a time loop may never have existed! As the time loop changes, Mary's history is too. As Rose changes the past, it becomes Mary's real present. By the end of the movie she is in the apartment of the woman who abducted her and hurt her as a child! This leads up to the idea that perhaps there was never a time loop, that perhaps Mary's having a psychotic breakdown and imagining what looks like a time warp, and that maybe Mary returned to Rose's apartment (where she was abducted and held as a child) to kill and hide her abusive husband (who has stalked her all the way back to Puerto Rico) in the wall where Rose's victims lay undiscovered! A psychotic break that leads to an unconscious plan to lure and murder her husband! The change in the perception of reality = The change in quantum reality. The First is the psychological premise in the movie, and the second is its scientific premise. The reason why none of the many whys you keep bringing up are never answered is because as the past changed, so would everything that the whys would have explained - so explaining all the whys would have been pointless, seeing how it all would have changed anyway! To get this movie think: Beginning to End = time loop, and End to Beginning = psychosis. It's brilliant! 5 stars! Fantastic movie with fantastic twists and reversals! What seems impossible becomes entirely probable and then almost obvious!",/review/rw2546192/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2011,krachtm,5," Interesting premise with poor execution
","The premise of this movie is actually somewhat interesting, even though it's pretty clearly ""borrowed"" from Frequency. I'm sure it was pitched as ""Frequency meets 100 Feet (the Eric Red movie from 2008)"". It's not the worst idea I've heard, though it's definitely derivative. The problem is that they never really got any further than that, and it plays out rather stereotypically, with heavy-handed direction, bland characters, trite plotting, and weak dialogue. What really saved the movie, however, was Lorna Raver, who played the crazy gypsy woman in Drag Me To Hell. Man, that woman is creepy! Just hearing her voice on the phone was enough to creep me out. Without her, this movie would only be a 4/10. I'm tempted to give this movie a 6/10, just because of her, but she was the only good thing in it, really.",/review/rw2546192/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2011,Red-Barracuda,7," Solid thriller with unusual supernatural angle

25 November 2012,ambercornell619,9," Definitely a must watch for the psychological thriller fans!
","This movie was a breath of fresh air for me. I am a huge horror film fan and so many times I am left disappointed with the so called ""horror films"" of my generation. (Which most time turn out to be nothing but a porno with some blood and guts thrown in.) This movie exceeded my expectations by a long shot. It had an interesting sotry line that kept me ineterested through out the entire film. It also was not just another gory joke of a horror film. This movie played totally on suspense! It leaves you wondering what's real and what's not, and it really makes you think! 9/10 from me. Its definitely a must see if you like the psychological thriller genre. :)",/review/rw2546192/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2011,manalatdxb,7," scarier than i thought!
","i went to see this movie without thinking i was going to be completely engrossed in the film and its complex characters. The story starts with a young woman that is currently in divorce proceedings from her estranged husband, moving into a new apartment. Everything starts off OK except that during her settling in to her new apartment she answers the phone where a older woman on the other line asks for a man that doesn't live there. from there on a phone relationship builds with this seemingly unstable elderly woman and a lonely young woman going through a difficult divorce. in time, strange things begin to happen and the movie takes a scary turn, it becomes extremely suspenseful and scary even though there is a lack of blood and graphic violence. i found the movie very entertaining and with its numerous twists, a movie that made you have discussions afterward in the theater with your friends about who was who, what does it really mean and what was real or a dream. a must see movie!",/review/rw2546192/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2011,a-wheater58,8," great movie
","I totally agree with the other reviewers that say that the film is not your average horror, it draws you in and is very clever and is a very good film of the horror genre without being a total cop out in the slasher come blood guts type, and its the story line that gives it its power, excellent.I know of a lot of this type that do not deliver in the way that you wish, but this film does not operate in the visceral way ,its more of the mind and makes you think more of what comes next, believe me , this film is better than most run of the mill films of this type.",/review/rw2546192/?ref_=tt_urv

12 December 2011,scarletheels,5," Refreshingly unpretentious but easily forgettable
","Mary (Rachelle Lefevre) moves in to an apartment complex in Puerto Rico to escape her abusive ex who is none too happy about the divorce or the restraining order placed against him. Soon after, she's plagued by a barrage of phone calls from someone who identifies herself only as Rose. Slowly, their casual conversations veer toward an ominous direction, and one by one, people around her start dying or disappearing after she tries to cut off contact with the deranged caller.",/review/rw2546192/?ref_=tt_urv

14 September 2011,JimmyCollins,7," Rachelle Lefevre impresses in supernatural chiller.
","The Caller is by no means the greatest horror film, nor is it particularly original but it is quite enjoyable, mainly thanks to the wonderful Rachelle Lefevre, she has graduated to leading lady very well in The Caller, let's hope she gets more leading roles more often, she has a great screen presence and is very nice to watch.",/review/rw2546192/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2011,trashgang,6," one to have your full attention to understand it all
","I came across this flick due the name Stephen Moyer. I adore True Blood so I wanted to see if he could do anything else outside True Blood. The main lead I was afraid of, Rachelle Lefevre coming out of one of the worst features, Twilight. God, I can't say it enough how bad that saga is. But I was surprised of her doings. She really was believable in this suspense thriller with a bit of horror here and there. This is the second feature that I've seen with Stephen and he act well but still it remind me of True Blood.

11 March 2012,TheUnknown837-1,7," It's not immensely scary, but it's playfully off-putting and very fun to look at
","The star of ""The Caller"" is a beguiling, personable young actress named Rachelle Lefevre and her unpretentious acting is one of several things that catapult this little glossed-over gem from the catacombs of third-rate horror. It is a much more imagination - and yes, creepy - supernatural flick than a lot of the junk we've gotten lately (""The Last Exorcism,"" ""Needle,"" to name a few). It's not immensely scary, but it's playfully off-putting and very fun to look at.",/review/rw2546192/?ref_=tt_urv

","This was easily the worst movie I've seen in the last five years. It had so many plot holes and poorly written characters that I spent 3/4 of the movie yelling at the screen. And not in a fun way. The only reason I watched the whole thing was so I could go on IMDb later and get what people were talking about. Then I went on and realized that either much of the general viewing audience has been lobotomized in the last few years, or anyone giving this movie more than three stars is a plant.",/review/rw2546192/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2013,Beginthebeguine,," Rotory Telephone flick does not connect with the subject matter
","In a 1964 episode of the television series Twilight Zone entitled ""The Night Call"" the director is able to make the telephone seriously creepy. It is too bad that the director of this film is not able to do the same. It is too bad, because the idea for the film is a solid one. It is not the same to have a great idea and to be able to express that idea in a uniquely visual medium as film. My understand is that the director was a novelist, but novels are, by their nature, internal. The struggle must come from within. Here, in this film, it is hard to feel like there is any real jeopardy. The director is not the only one asleep at the wheel however, the actors seem to be sleepwalking throughout the picture. Perhaps it was just another pay day for the cast and crew. I know that the director could have fixed the pacing during the editing process, but that would be too much to ask from such a novice film maker. So whoever edited this film should be ashamed of themselves. The lighting and camera work is also horrible. I would recommend that you miss this one and check out the Twilight Zone episode I mention above.",/review/rw2546192/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2012,rivertam26,7," The Caller
","After hearing some decent buzz about this little indie thriller I decided to put in on my netflix que. And as most of you who have netflix know. Life is busy and it just sat there and wasted my monthly membership lol. And to be honest I didn't think it was going to be very good. Well I'm happy to say I was wrong. The film is a completely original horror esque thriller thats solidly executed. It stars Rachael Lefvre of the Twilight films as a young woman who moves into an apartment after an abusive marriage. She's constantly stalked by her creepy ex and is always on the edge. She than begins to receive strange phone calls looking for someone who doesn't live here. As the crazed calls proceed she questionably finds out that the woman who is speaking to her lived in her apartment in the 70's and is actually calling from the 70's. it's all very twilight zone esque. but here's the big kicker. She's brutally psychotic and as the young woman tries to ignore the phone calls things and people begin to change in Lefvre's life because the crazed woman is murdering them in the past. Now I don't want to give away any twists but the film has got some really shockingly creepy moments. And it somehow makes the simplicity of the house phone menacing again. The cool thing about this movie is that it keeps you going and going and even ends with an unexpected nice bang. Also Lefvre's lead performance is really quite surprising she's strong, vulnerable and comes across as a very capable actress. But the film does have a few weaknesses such as the film quality. It feels very cloudy and cheap like something off the lifetime network, something thats sure to distract you a bit from the films quality in the beginning. And there is a cheesy little romance with a surprisingly sexy Stephen Moyer of True Blood fame. Accompanied by a forced little sex scene. Nonetheless, It's a neat little movie thats worth seeking out and watching. It offers more quality thrills and solid storytelling than most of the films plaguing the multiplexes right now.",/review/rw2546192/?ref_=tt_urv
