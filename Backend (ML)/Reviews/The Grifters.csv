6 September 2018,chris_robbo_23,7," Awkward, cringeworthy, but very funny!
",I went to see this movie at the cinema with my uncle and the opening scene caught us off guard completely but it set the tone for the whole film. It has some really brilliant laughs and nothing is taken too serious. ,/review/rw4974639/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2021,kosmasp,8," In (between) Festival
","I only have seen the Inbetweeners movies ... but it makes sense that this advertizes itself as something along that line. This is rude, foul language, immature funny and lots of other things that you might not really agree with. But there is still so much heart in it.",/review/rw4974639/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2018,southdavid,5," Glaston-barely passible
","Dumped by his Uni girlfriend at Graduation, but stuck with an expensive ticket to a Summer Music Festival, Nick (played with willingness but familiarity by Joe Thomas) and his best friend Shane (Hammed Animashaun) head for a weekend of music, drugs and mud 'somewhere ..... somewhere in a field in Hampshire .... Alright'. ",/review/rw4974639/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2018,fallyhag,5," Lazy writing that relies on gross out humour
",A mash of the inbetweeners and the hangover. This film should be in court for multiple stolen ideas. There are very few funny bits and the story is painfully predictable and dull. I'm rrallu struggling to understand how they failed so badly at writing their own story rather than copying others. It's just a lazy film that didn't need to be made like it was. Not recommended.,/review/rw4974639/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2018,timbmorris276,8," Haters just calm down ... And grow up !!
","Wasn't expecting a masterpiece just 90 mins of laughs , got that on the most part , it's crude , rude , non pc , immature at times , but don't believe FlashCallahans 'review, there were many laugh out loud moments and groans in the cinema showing I went to . Just enjoy , yes it is like watching the third Inbetweeners movie , but if it ain't broke why fix it .",/review/rw4974639/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2018,FlashCallahan,2," My names not Lick!!....
","So just when all the festivals are coming to an end and Uni is about to recommence, we have another cash cow comedy released to try and bring 'friends together'",/review/rw4974639/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2018,boydpeters,2," Why would you Make a film where you hate the main character?
",Hes not funny. Hes not awkward. He's not cute. Or funny. The cringe hurts. Nick is an awful moron. Selfish gift. The writers are not clever. Do they think he is a Hugh Grant or Ricky Jervais.,/review/rw4974639/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2020,masonsaul,7," Really good comedy
","The Festival is a really good comedy that's fun and enjoyable and relaint on a predictable narrative, which is fine. Joe Thomas, Hammed Animashaun and Claudia O'Doherty are all great and Jemaine Clement is a scene stealer in his small part. It's funny and at points hilarious which makes up for the jokes that are gross and don't land. Iain Morris' direction is good, it's well filmed and well paced. The soundtrack is really good.",/review/rw4974639/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2018,zoegreen-194-798504,5," 10 Years Too Late
","Seems like a film that should have come out in 2008, it just seemed out of touch. Played Mr Brightside at least 3 times. There were definitely some funny moments but just the same joke formats as the inbetweeners, nothing new. Noticed a joke pinched from Peep Show (no thanks, I'm full). Overall I had a fun time going to see this movie but I will never watch it again.",/review/rw4974639/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2018,powersy86,1," Avoid at all costs
","Saw this one at my local cinema this evening, not expecting a great deal from one of the head honcho's behind the flawless Inbetweeners & arguably the weakest of the 4 main cast. But I gave it a go regardless and my fears were realised almost immediately. ",/review/rw4974639/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2018,bdunkley,4," Some funny bits
",All in all a pretty awful film with the odd funny bit here and there. If you're a bit inbetweeners fan you'll watch it anyway but doesn't even compare.,/review/rw4974639/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2019,stevehellboy,3," Mmmmmm.
",Yeah I should've listened to the reviews of this film. It was very very cringeworthy. The tone compared to Inbetweeners is very different,/review/rw4974639/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2019,carlospresents,8," Great Fun.
",Throwaway nonsense but still great fun. A bit like Kevin and Perry. The main actor is a one trick pony who is still playing the same role he did in Inbetweeners. It works though. Claudia O'Doherty stands out. Good fun film. Give it a do and pretend you're a useless teenager again.,/review/rw4974639/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2018,paulnbrowne,1," A complete waste of 98 minutes of my life. Appallinglybad.....
","I gave this one star only because I couldn't give it zero. Really,really, really, really bad. Terrible moronic script. Wooden acting. No interest in the characters at all. Nothing actually happened. Just puerile and boring. My daughter and I were going to see BlacKKKlansman but we got the time wrong. This was the only late film showing. I wish we had saved the money. Utter tripe. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!",/review/rw4974639/?ref_=tt_urv

","Honestly, how much did you expect from a comedy like this? ",/review/rw4974639/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2020,vampire_hounddog,4," Dated before it was released mis-fired comedy that tries and fails to repeat some of the comedy success of THE INBETWEENERS
","During his graduation ceremony from University, Nick (Joe Thomas) is humiliated when his girlfriend (Hannah Tointon) unceremoniously dumps him. He reluctantly agrees to a music festival with his best friend (Hammed Animashaun) where Nick bumps into his ex. She is with her mates and over the weekend and he tries desperately to get back together with her and goes through a series of cringy disasters along the way.",/review/rw4974639/?ref_=tt_urv

",I was quite looking forward to this film. Loved The Inbetweeners and was hoping for more of the same.,/review/rw4974639/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2018,rustonreviews,4," Mixed vibes.
","After being dumped by his girlfriend Caitlin (Hannah Tointon) at graduation, Nick (Thomas) spends days on end moping in his bedroom and eating endless amounts of chicken, mourning the abrupt death of his university relationship. Determined to lift him out of his break up slump, Nick's best mate Shane (Animashaun) convinces him to forget about Caitlin by enduring a colossal three day music festival. Shane is ultimately hyped to see his music idol Hammerhead (a DJ whose identity is obscured by a large Hammerhead mask in the same vein as Frank Sidebottom), whereas a self centered and an all-round dull dud Nick fails to ease up and have a good time, especially when he runs into Caitlin and all their other uni mates who've set up camp for the weekend.

25 August 2018,neil-476,7," Likeable and rude
","When Nick is dumped by Caitlyn at graduation his mate Shane drags him along to a pop festival (which Nick doesn't really want to go to) in order to distract him, although the real reason is that Shane wants to try to meet one of the acts. Accompanied by truly annoying Australian habitual festival-goer Amy, they discover Caitlyn is also at the festival. So might she get together with Nick again?",/review/rw4974639/?ref_=tt_urv
