4 January 2023,cardsrock,8," Excess is the name of the game
","Whether it be orgies, showcasing various bodily fluids, plot threads, or the runtime of the film, Damien Chazelle is fully unrestrained in his latest film. La La Land and Whiplash are some of my favorite films and I'm a big fan of Chazelle's directorial style. He shows flashes of that brilliance often throughout Babylon, but does indulge in his most extreme tendencies as well in this modern Hollywood epic.",/review/rw8836469/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2022,CANpatbuck3664,8," Babylon is Destined for Polarizing Feedback but It's a Bumping and Crazy Party for Better or Worse
","After an ""interesting"" opening scene about our main character Manny (Diego Calva) trying to get an elephant up to a party in Bel-Air, Babylon floors the gas pedal and barely comes up for air for the rest of the run time. I wanted to credit Damien Chazelle and his team for providing a unique experience in regards to pacing, setting and tone. The expression ""fever dream"" is overused but Babylon is captured in such a chaotic and constantly shifting way that kept me enraptured. The movie looks fantastic and even if you don't have an interest in this period of cinema, I don't doubt that Babylon will still pull you in. The costuming and sets are dynamic and show how disorganized and tumultuous early Hollywood was. I was hooked from the get-go and for all the movie's flaws, its presentation is vibrant and fast-moving to keep help you entertained.",/review/rw8836469/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2023,DeadMansTrousers,4," Overindulgence doesn't make a good movie
","So many reviews praise this film for the level of ""debauchery"" shown in it or the devotion the actors gave to said debauchery. But just because you have the willingness to fill your film with an over excess of sex, drugs, violence, and human bodily fluids doesn't mean you have a good film. This movie feels like it goes on forever and has endless character who serve no real purpose to progressing the story. At the core there is a decent plot but it falls apart and some of the scenes feel like they were written by a teenage boy imagining what his ideal ""fantasy"" would play out like. This movie will easily become a cult classic just for how vulgar it is.",/review/rw8836469/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,davidgee,3," I'm with the elephant!
","In the opening scene of BABYLON an elephant on a pick-up empties its bowels over one of its handlers. This, I'm sorry to say, sets the tone for much of what follows. This is a long movie - three hours, much of which is crap.",/review/rw8836469/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2022,nicolasroop,4," Over-indulgent, bloated and, ultimately, pointless!
","My main takeaway when I left the theater this evening after watching this film, was that it was far too long and had probably one storyline too many to make this movie fly, but instead after the first act, it drags, and drags, and drags.",/review/rw8836469/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,drownsoda90,8," A scabrous, ambitious, Ken Russell-esque love (and hate) letter to cinema
","""Babylon"" tracks the career of Manny Torres, an aspiring filmmaker from Mexico who crosses paths with fellow aspiring starlet Nelly LaRoy at a bacchanalian party one night in 1920s Los Angeles. The film also follows several other characters at the same party, including movie star Jack Conrad, cabaret performer Fay Zhu, tabloid journalist Elinor St. John, and musician Sidney Palmer, as each rise and fall in their respective careers spanning the end of silent films and the beginning of sound productions; each of the characters cross paths throughout as they navigate the shifting business of Hollywood.",/review/rw8836469/?ref_=tt_urv

","As ""Babylon"" (2-22 release; 189 min) opens, we are in ""Bel Air, CA 1926"", and find ourselves at a massive and out-of-hand party, where sex and drugs are ""de rigueur"". Jack Conrad, a big movie star, becomes the center of the party upon his arrival. Also there is Nellie LaRoy, a beautiful and brash aspiring actress. Also there is Manuel Torres, who hopes to find a job in the movie industry. At this point we are 10 minutes into the film.",/review/rw8836469/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,ferguson-6,7," Margot is all in!
","Greetings again from the darkness. It's 1926 and a movie mogul is planning yet another massive debauchery-filled industry party at his palace of a home in still-developing Bel-Air, California. Lest we have any doubt that this party is over-the-top, we are forced to witness the handlers of the main attraction - a circus elephant - get sprayed from the wrong end as they push the colossal beast up the hill. Once the party starts, things get even crazier. Orgies, drugs, nudity, wild dancing, and a golden shower and drug overdose in the room of a Fatty Arbuckle type ... yes, this opening party sequence lasts 20-30 minutes, and occurs before the opening credits. The only touch of class is the old school Paramount logo.",/review/rw8836469/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2022,bastille-852-731547,4," An indulgent mess with surprisingly little to say
","Given that ""Whiplash"" and ""La La Land"" were outstanding films, it seemed reasonable to hope-and expect-that director Damien Chazelle's new film would deliver. It seemed to be a unique spectacle of excess and debauchery in 1920s Hollywood that would combine flashiness with, hopefully and given Chazelle's previous track record, a compelling story and profound character development. Tragically, however, ""Babylon"" is a bloated misfire that ends up being unique for all the wrong reasons.",/review/rw8836469/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2022,210west,4," A big, bloated, shapeless mess, filled with lazy caricatures
","I've seen all four of Damien Chazelle's movies; none has struck me as especially satisfying. This one, all three joyless hours of it, gave me barely a moment of pleasure. It's a perfect example of -- in a phrase often used by Esquire -- ""wretched excess.""",/review/rw8836469/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,goshamorrell,10," A cinematic experience
","Babylon is cinematic marvel that Damien Chazelle is a messy, dazzling epic masterpiece that film hasn't yet accepted or had before. Damien Chazelle has called Babylon: ""A hate letter to Hollywood and a love letter to movies,"" but his messy, dazzling epic doesn't support that simplistic idea. Set in the early days of cinema, when talking pictures were a jaw-dropping phenomenon and Hollywood was still being created, Babylon suggests a deeper reality: the film industry's raw, self-destructive, narcissistic impulses and its glorious, magical results have always been opposite parts of the same whole. Chazelle's ambitions are huge. Babylon is full of remarkable set pieces with richly drawn characters, music, dancing, love and betrayal. The film's strengths more than make up for its serious flaws, including too many endings and a wrong-headed reliance on Singin' in the Rain as a touchstone. But if Babylon makes you groan occasionally, there are many more times long, exhilarating stretches that are mesmerising. In one of the film's multiple endings, which leaps ahead to 1952, a major character sits in a cinema tearfully watching Singin' in the Rain. That enamoured-of-movies scene hasn't been fresh since Sullivan's Travels in 1941, not to mention Cinema Paradiso in 1988 and this year's Empire of Light. The fact that the scene can be viewed as a homage to all those films doesn't make it less cliched. And a montage of other movies through history is a bravura but needless coda. At its best, Chazelle's film is a cinematic marvel, evidence enough that movies are magical, as it sweeps us into the beautiful, terrible world we recognise as Hollywood even now. The cast up and down Babylon is amazing and almost eerily in sync with my own tastes. Actors I deeply love, like Taylor Nichols and Ethan Suplee, show up oh-so-briefly as if casting director Francine Maisler had thumbed through my own mental rolodex and said to herself ""ah, here's another face Sonny would like to see."" This is, perhaps, another reason I found myself drawn in by Babylon's excess: I just liked spending time with almost everyone up on that big, beautiful screen, I fell in love with the cast and the story. Believing Babylon to be over, thus missing the last few of its 189 minutes. This was itself a fitting, almost serendipitous, way to end the movie. Audiences come and go; they are as ephemeral and ever-changing as the names on the marquee. The darkened theater filled with flickering light? That's eternal, everlasting, deathless. The actors and the audiences alike come and go, but the show goes on forever.",/review/rw8836469/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2022,jakethesnake-42007,5," Sometimes less is more
",I can see why the reviews are polarized and why people hate the film. It's a frustrating film at times mainly cause there is so much going on. Right off the bat it's crazy flash and busy tho I enjoyed it at first at the film progressed it gets more busy and busy and then the ending is so busy and goes on and on and on and it doesn't know when to end. That's the main fault of the film is that less is more and that would of helped the film. There is also much characters that the supporting characters don't get enough screen time and story that they seem pointless at times or lost. The acting is amazing especially Margot Robbie who deserves all the praise for the film. I get what the film was aiming at but it just lands where you hate or love it at times. It's frustrating and at times gives you a headache. I overall enjoyed the film at times and thought it was ok though I would not recommended the film.,/review/rw8836469/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2022,ericgoldberg-50159,3," Decadent, Depraved And Tasteless
",This movie shows how spoiled rotten actors are. They get paid massive amounts of money to pretend to be someone they are not. They drink and drug excessively. They have outrageous and decadent parties all the time. They have all the fame and fortune in the world and it's never enough for them. I honestly don't have too much sympathy for them in many ways. This movie has no actual plot. It's just spoiled actors acting like whiny children. It also is excessively long at over three hours of Hollywood psychosis.,/review/rw8836469/?ref_=tt_urv

1 February 2023,Top_Dawg_Critic,6," At least an hour too long.
","This film felt like it was written and directed by a high school drama class kid with ADHD. It was exhausting to watch, and it was all over the place with too much filler, too many unnecessary sub-plots, convoluted scenes and dialogue, with horrible editing and scene start and cuts. In the hands of better more experienced filmmaker, this could've very easily been so much better and more enjoyable. Writer and director Damien Chazelle gave us a hack-job screenplay with overzealous and pointlessly outlandish scenes, that are all style with very little substance. The all star stellar cast were all amazing, especially Margot Robbie - who was the only reason I didn't stop watching 40+ mins into this utter disastrous nonsense. The critics got this one right. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, all going to the performances and decent cinematography.",/review/rw8836469/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2022,jmworacle-99025,8," The darkside of the ""Golden Age of Hollywood"".
","I see that this movie is being considered a bomb. I can see why considering the movie runs for three hours. I was blessed with a private showing. Actually I was the only one in theater. While the movie was slow it was interesting. The movie revolves around three main characters: Manny Torres played by Diego Calva, Manny's quick thinking helps saves the day and puts him on the radar of the brass and his star rises to the title of being in charge of MGM's Latin America divison and eventually being the handler of the newest star Nellie LaRoy played beautifully by Margo Robbie. Then we have actor Jack Conrad silent superstar who like many of his fellow stars of that era had difficulty transfering to ""talkies"".",/review/rw8836469/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2022,dorMancyx,8," A Forever Party, An Unfading Generation
","When the movie starts off with a first-person-POV shot of a guy getting showered by damp, steaming, elephant feces, you know the rated-R Damien Chazelle is back, yet this time rather than bombards of profanity, it's the orgy, the indulgence, the ecstasy. The combined usage of long takes, close-ups, and handheld shots portray the environment, emotion, and atmosphere to their fullest extent, exhibiting the directory's impeccable costume design and scenic layout. Despite the film mainly concentrating on the early theatrical industry, Chazelle still managed to merge his favorite jazz component into the storyline, and the overall soundtrack is, though not as pervasive and brainwashing as La La Land's, melodically memorable, ornamenting the flamboyant history with a light touch of sentiment. Plot-wise, I thoroughly enjoyed the individual character's venture, rise, and decadence while interacting with themselves, one another, and the changing world of cinematic art, which I found delightfully reminiscent of Wong Kar-wai's The Grandmaster. However, the introduction of Tobey Maguire's figure and the underground Tim Burton circus is entirely unnecessary and tedious, wrecking the pacing. In addition, the final montage of film segments is overly personalized to the point of being bewildering - in summary, not the best resolution.",/review/rw8836469/?ref_=tt_urv

","I love the cinema! Babylon is a spectacular epic film, truly a masterpiece. I think this movie deserves the Oscar for best picture of the year. It is a remarkable story following several characters living the dream and the starlight of Hollywood. Chazelle has created a movie that is a love letter to Hollywood not because of depraved parties or preventing talented minorities from becoming stars but from reflecting how far Hollywood has become.",/review/rw8836469/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2022,subxerogravity,8," I thought it was great!
","Personally, I'm a sucker for movies about old school Hollywood. The film is a satire on the transition between silent films and ""Talkies"" as they were called. If you like film as much as I do those moments are too cool. The frustration of adding sound to your movie by filmmakers use to the freedom that was given without the new technology and how this new technology effected the movie stars of the time. There are still some people on this earth (but not many) who completely understand what a game changer sound was to Hollywood and I thought the film captured that Brilliantly.",/review/rw8836469/?ref_=tt_urv
