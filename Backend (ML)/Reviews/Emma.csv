12 May 2016,cosmo_tiger,7," A funny & moving romantic comedy, that deals more with self discovery than the pursuit of love itself. Field is great.
","""She's definitely weird, but like a good weird."" Doris Miller (Field) has just lost her mother and reason for living. She isn't sure what to do now, stuck in a job and spending her nights with her friend Roz and Vivian. One day while heading to work she sees John (Greenfield) and everything changes. She falls in love with him and wants to find the courage to talk to him. Little by little Doris opens up and finds her confidence, and begins to find herself again. This is a movie that flips the norm on its head. This movie deals with an older woman trying to pursue a younger man. Sally Field gives one of her best performances to date and really plays this character perfectly. You feel sorry for her but not to the point of pity, and really root for her but also cringe a few times at her actions. This is at its core a funny and moving romantic comedy, but it deals more with self discovery than the pursuit of love itself. That is refreshing to see and because of that it actually felt fresh. Overall, just a really nice movie with a great performance by Sally Field. I give this a B.",/review/rw3443931/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2016,lee_eisenberg,10," Sally Field's role works on so many levels
","Sally Field gets the role of a lifetime as a hoarder working in a trendy office who has the hots for a younger employee. One of the best things about ""Hello, My Name Is Doris"" is that it shows how Doris is sort of an oddball and can irritate those around her, but is nonetheless a good person. She was the only sibling who took care of their mom. Basically, Doris wants to stick to her house and possessions, and their representation of the old days amid a world that advances too quickly for her, and her attraction to this younger man is the only possible sexual satisfaction for her. Most of all, it's refreshing to see a movie that focuses on older women (aside from Doris, there's her friend Roz, played by Tyne Daly). One of the most impressive scenes is when Doris gets photographed (and believe me, Sally Field looks sexy in some of those outfits that she wears).",/review/rw3443931/?ref_=tt_urv

17 June 2016,gradyharp,7," ""Impossible? Make that I'm possible!""
","Need a feel good movie? This little sentimental but funny and ultimately emotionally satisfying film is the work of Laura Terruso (form her previous short film 'Doris & The Intern') and Michael Showalter who also directs. The story at times becomes exasperating because of the failure of the main character to step out of her old backward ways in dress and behavior and join the contemporary times, but it also s a reminder of how aging people define their world and their entrapment in it.

22 March 2016,dglink,8," A Showcase for Sally Field
","Norma Rae, Edna Spalding, Mrs. Gump, Mary Todd Lincoln, and Doris Miller. Sally Field's most recent role, Doris Miller, is a worthy addition to her amazing gallery of film performances, given since she emerged as Gidget a half century ago. An eccentric, lonely woman of advancing years, Doris has sacrificed her life to care for her now-deceased mother. Mother and daughter have evidently been hoarders, and Doris's brother and sister-in-law eagerly want her to clean up and clear out, because they want to sell the Staten Island house. Meanwhile, Doris fixates on John Fremont, a much younger man, who is the new art director in her Manhattan office, and, inspired by a motivational speaker named Willy Williams and by countless bodice-busting romance novels, she decides to pursue romantic involvement with the good looking young guy. While ""Hello, My Name is Doris"" plays out somewhat predictably, the film provides a showcase for Sally Field in yet another Oscar-worthy performance.",/review/rw3443931/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2016,Dragoneyed363,9," I don't know if some just didn't get the movie...
","It's fine if you didn't enjoy it, to each their own, but I find it highly implausible to call the main character a ""creep"" or talk about how she's morally corrupt. Come on. This movie is about how all people yearn for human connection, and it's not like Doris is present day Hitler. Sally Field plays an elderly woman who is very reserved and lonely to an extent, like all of us. The film mostly tries to convey how all people deserve love and care, even estranged elderly women, and it does so in a very fun and lighthearted manner, in my opinion.",/review/rw3443931/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2016,ferguson-6,6," Girls Night Out
","Greetings again from the darkness. Hollywood has long ignored the pushback on its habit of casting younger women as the love interest of older men. In most of those movies, the relationships are treated as normal and expected. In the few movies that turn the tables, a relationship between an older woman and younger man is typically treated as either comedy or scandal Â… consider Harold and Maude (1971) and Notes on a Scandal (2006). In this latest film, writer/director Michael Showalter (The Baxter) and co-writer Laura Terruso strive to balance heartfelt emotions with situational laughs. ",/review/rw3443931/?ref_=tt_urv

",Sally Field plays Doris. She's a woman in a dead end job who has spent her whole life caring for her mom. Now her mom is dead and her mean brother and equally vicious wife want her to move out of the house she spent her whole life in. Then a handsome young man named John (Max Greenfield) starts at her work. She falls for him quickly. Problem is he's young enough to be her son! She tries to get him ignoring her best friend (Tyne Daly) who tries to talk sense to her. It has a realistic if bittersweet ending.,/review/rw3443931/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2018,mark.waltz,6," Could Doris be the twin sister that Gidget never met?
","I find that modern films come in four varieties: those which stand the test of time (a rare few), those which appeal to older audiences or the art house crowd, those only meant for young audiences, and those which the various generations can look at in their own way. That last genre is how I see this film, and coming from the late baby boomer era, I find a lot to appreciate here, a lot to make me cringe, and even a lot more to laugh at. I identify with the seemingly sad character played by Sally Field, lost in her world of having taken care of a dying parent. She's also the sole survivor of the veterans in a modernized company (ridiculously) which takes out chairs and puts in oversized beachballs simply ""because"". A new young employee (Max Greenfield) whom she becomes obsessed with, stalks on social media (another big eew), becomes ridiculously trendy, yet comes to life for the very first time.

20 March 2016,paul-allaer,7," ""Impossible? I'm possible!""
","""Hello, My Name Is Doris"" (2015 release; 90 min.) brings the story of Doris (played by Sally Field). As the movie opens, we see Doris mourning the passing of her mom, and being pressured by her brother to sell the maternal house, or at least get rid of all the stuff Doris is hoarding. It's not long before we see Doris doing her daily work commute on the Staten Island Ferry to Manhattan, and in the packed elevator onto the office, she is pressed up against a younger guy, who turns out to be the new art director at her work. Doris promptly develops a crush on him. At this point we're 10 minutes or so into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw3443931/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2016,moonspinner55,6," Amusing and observant moments in the service of a dishonest movie...
","Sally Field, outfitted like a retro bag lady, plays an elderly data entry operator from Staten Island who lives like a hoarder in her deceased mother's house and has few friends; everything changes, however, once she becomes close with the handsome young man she works with--and secretly loves. Writers Laura Terruso, expanding her short film ""Doris & the Intern,"" and Michael Showalter, who also directed, build the second-half of their movie on the dramatic crux that Doris has inadvertently broken up her crush and his girlfriend after creating a phony Facebook account, and it's not enough. Nor is it convincing when Doris' brother and hateful sister-in-law try to rearrange her life (and, eventually, Doris comes around to see they're right!). There are fantasy interludes which intrude upon the narrative that are a cheat, and also a photo session for a music group that should be a fantasy but isn't. Field is terrific in an unbelievable role; the actress shows us many different sides of Doris and makes her endearing, even though the conception of this character is basically unreal. **1/2 from ****",/review/rw3443931/?ref_=tt_urv

","There's so much more to this than just an older woman falling for a younger man. Doris' life had been cut off as a young woman when she was needed to take care of her ailing mother. Upon her death, she returns to where she left off in her youth. She doesn't really have any other reference than that which she felt like as a young woman in love, and never was given the opportunity to pursue those feelings. That's is Doris' starting point and her return to herself. It's beautiful and Sally Field and Max play it beautifully as well as the other actors. Tyne Daly is at her best.

2 April 2016,j_stromoski,3," Get ready to cringe.
","Sally Field does the best job in the world with a terrible character that should not be the lead focus of a movie. A lot of people will probably say that Field's character was ""charming"" or ""eccentric"", but I'm 100% creeped out by this woman. Nearly every choice this woman makes in this movie is wrong. She manipulates situations to wiggle her way into a young man's life to try and seduce him. Putting aside the role is a harmless old lady played by innocent-looking Sally Field, if the script was flipped the movie would be even more unappealing. Imagine Burt Reynolds hitting on Anna Kendrick...precisely.",/review/rw3443931/?ref_=tt_urv
