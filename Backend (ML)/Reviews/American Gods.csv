23 February 2020,caelum-natura,8," I'm 38. Today I watched this movie first time
","With horrible movies coming out month after month I searched for a good movie. And I found Armageddon on HBO GO and remembered that I never watched this movie in full. So many years after release, I took the time, headphones, 50 inch tv and some popcorn. Let me tell you one thing - THIS IS ONE FANTASTIC MOVIE. They don't make movies like this anymore. We give oscars to crap today, this was pure pleasure and I'm glad I never wathched it before. I always caught part of it. But today, 22 years later hehe :) man, I miss the old movie making skill.",/review/rw2252651/?ref_=tt_urv

8 July 2019,HotToastyRag,7," Great cast with tons of energy
","Believe it or not, I managed to escape the 1990s without sitting through Armageddon. I'm notoriously squeamish about ""we're all going to die!"" movies, so the only reason I did sit through it was because it was Bruce Willis's week on Hot Toasty Rag. Thankfully, my mom prepped me for it and told me everything that happened so I wouldn't be too scared or sad. So, if you're squeamish like me, and you want to watch it anyway, just ask your mom how it ends.",/review/rw2252651/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2006,madmaxmedia,8," My Ultimate Guilty Pleasure- how do you assign a rating to that?
","This movie is my ultimate guilty pleasure. It's inane, manipulative, has hyperactive cutting, a ton of glaring inaccuracies (pointless to even discuss or debate), and probably 29 other glaring faults. And why in every dramatic slow-mo emo shot are there 3 helicopters flying in unison overhead? What's the point of having 3 helicopters flying really close together? Who cares! It looks cool. If one day I am having a heartfelt talk with my daughter, I hope there are 3 helicopters flying overhead to really 'bring it home' (and Aerosmith performing in the background.)",/review/rw2252651/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2019,0w0,7," Incredibly unrealistic, but still a fun 2hrs20min
","Steam, wind, sound and gravity on an asteroid flying through space? Yeah the director didn't really think this whole 'space thing' through (or I think he simply didn't care... he was just like: ""Meh, let's just make it fun""). And the movie is pretty fun, if you ignore the obvious inconsistencies and plot holes. Just take it like this: It's a movie of Bruce Willis and his team of misfits attempting to save the world by going to outer-space and blowing up a giant asteroid that's hurtling towards earth. PS. Liv Tyler at 21 y/o was unbelievably beautiful... she's distractingly gorgeous in the movie.",/review/rw2252651/?ref_=tt_urv

","Having sat down in 2022 to watch the 1998 action sci-fi movie ""Armageddon"" for the fifth time or so since it was released, I have to say that director Michael Bay's movie continues to be as enjoyable and entertaining today as it was 24 years ago.",/review/rw2252651/?ref_=tt_urv

","Beastly movie on so many different levels. action, intensity, suspense, creativity, acting (mostly), likable characters, comedy, music, emotional parts, love story, getting you emotionally invested. never once bored on a 2.5 hour movie. you definitely have to turn your brain off, but if you do, you'll have a great time. and this movie gives me the feels. hard core. numerous times.

22 July 2009,preppy-3,7," I agree that this film is stupid but I was entertained
","After some silly opening narration by Charlton Heston the story starts. According to this an asteroid the size of Texas is going to hit the Earth in 13 days. If it hits it will destroy the entire planet. (I know I know--just go with it) So NASA (led by a slumming Bily Bob Thornton) hires a group of oil drillers (led by Bruce Willis), trains them how to work in outer space, sets them off to drill a hole in the asteroid, set explosives and get the hell out of there...all in 11 days. Also, before the asteroid hits, meteors are coming down and virtually wiping out major cities like New York and Shanghai.",/review/rw2252651/?ref_=tt_urv

25 October 2007,buzznzipp1995,8," Not Quite The End of The World...
","I'll be the first to tell you, special FX are not what I look for when I am hitting the movies, I love intelligence and acting, story, story, story, good directing at least. But from the opening scenes, 'ARMAGEDDON' explodes into emergency action. This sci-fi comedy-drama was a solid hit!! I have to fully disagree with critics who will praise a horrible movie and then say that a story like this is not bigger than life. This is a blockbuster entertainment giant, with a striking sense of humor, which 'Rockhound' (Bucsemi) provided many laughs, along with the rest of the multi-talented and troubled 'troup' of civilized maniacs. I truly think that the plot of the story is fun to think about, the world needs to be saved by a bunch of motley-ruff necks that can hardly obey the regular laws in their own city and now, they are going to work with the laws of gravity, science and all else to keep the planet from becoming a memory. Every movie mogul wants a block buster that is going to in essence save the world from total oblation and hit the box office with a vengeance. This one does it with he-man style and a wise-crack or two. They all ride together though, Harry Stamper, Grace the young in love daughter of Harry, Charles Chapple er, I mean 'Chick', A.J. also in love with Grace much to Harry's uneasiness, 'Rockhound' who just wants to have girls' who 'just want to have fun' the man who is a sky-scraper if anything else, Jayotis 'Bear' who is strong and a bit on the sensitive side, just to give us equilibrium, when they landed on the surface of the huge rock and he looks up and emotional and exclaims Thank you Jesus! The theater roared! He was right though. Then there is 'Oscar' who is a fun having not so fearless worker, and the comically sarcastic, but easy going Max, all under N.A.S.A Administrator Dan Truman who can't fly anymore. But he gets to watch these birds-of-a-feather, working together. With everyone up and going plus Lev Andropov the Russian Cosmonaut who works hard and gets a little too rowdy! They are able even with the adversity of Col. William Sharp they come together and pull it off and even with the last few moments when Harry Gives his life for A.J. in a very touching moment the story comes together and sets it right, the screw balls have a mature moment and a sobering lesson. But this crew is great!! They all mix together like a great drink. Bruce has the Juice, along with the rest of the motley crew, making this adventure a blast, even by today's standards it still comes across with strength, style, and comedic punch!

12 February 2000,el_monty_BCN,9," This grows on you
","I remember that after seeing Armageddon for the first time, I went to look it up in IMDb, and I gave it a 6. I didn't flunk it because I had to admit that it was entertaining fun, but at the time I was miffed by the fact that it was a ridiculously, absurdly exaggerated plot, blatantly manipulative and without the faintest shade of seriousness, verisimilitude or believability. And directed like an MTV video, as you would expect from Bay. God forgive me, I even remember saying I preferred Deep Impact!",/review/rw2252651/?ref_=tt_urv

15 May 2003,XJoey,8," Fun, Action-packed movie.
","This movie seems to be a movie that many people love to hate.  I don't see why it has such a bad reputation.  It is meant to be an Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie, and it definitely lives up to this.  It is what it is. Many people have tried to compare it to Apollo 13, but that's like comparing apples and oranges.  They are entirely different fruit. Apollo 13 is based on a true historical event (Docu-drama), while Armageddon is an Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie.  It has plenty of action and adventure, a lot of humor, and a bit of romance.  Is the story realistic? Not hardly, but name ANY Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie that is.  That's why they call it Science FICTION... For those who criticize this movie, nothing will change their minds. However, if you HAVEN'T seen Armageddon, take a chance, watch with an open mind and try not to let all these negative reviews spoil your enjoyment of a really fun movie.  Remember, a movie is meant to ENTERTAIN, and Armageddon does just that, if you let it!",/review/rw2252651/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2004,polkadotlegwarmers,7," far fetched, over the top, funny. i like it!
","*minor spoilers* This film follows the basic asteroid going to hit earth plot. They find out about the asteroid, some brave souls are sent to destroy it, they get into problems, and one has to die to save the planet. With one major twist. Does NASA send a group of highly trained astronauts to save the earth from destruction? No. instead they call on Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and his gang of oil drilling misfits. This happy gang are rounded up from a strip club, casino and various other hideouts, to save the world.",/review/rw2252651/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2005,Theo Robertson,3," I've Seen Razor Commercials With More Depth
","Looking through the IMDb trivia section I see that Ben Affleck can up with the conclusion that it might be easier training astronauts to be drillers rather than training drillers to be astronauts , but then was told to shut up after pointing this out to the producers . Hey I thought this too and I'm sure that everyone who hated this dumb movie thought the same . When the cleverest person on the set is Ben Affleck you know the movie is heading for disaster . That's just one aspect that's wrong with the script , there's plenty of more like the sketchy and clichéd characters , the scientific blunders and the unrealistic scenario - A bunch of redneck oil drillers attempt to save the earth by travelling to an asteroid , just think about that for a moment and see how the concept quickly collapses ",/review/rw2252651/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film is unashamedly corny. Unrealistic with a cheesy end but it's entertaining. And when the people giving this 2's, 3's & 4's should politely remove their heads from their asses if their problem was lack of realism. It's pure cheesy entertainment so just enjoy it and don't over think it.",/review/rw2252651/?ref_=tt_urv
