20 October 2007,ferguson-6,8," C'mon, it's funny. Is it?
","Greetings again from the darkness. Guilt while laughing is an unusual experience ... well except while watching Lars and Bianca. This film is hilarious, touching and insightful. The product of genius writing by Nancy Oliver (Six Feet Under) and solid direction by Craig Gillespie (""Mr. Woodcock""), this film will force you to step back and think about how you treat those who might be a little different or struggle with social interaction.",/review/rw1872586/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2007,ssto,9," sad, sad movie
","Mislead by some comments here i expected a laugh-out comedy, Ben Stiler style. Many other people in the cinema expected the same and from the beginning of the film they laughed at the slightest hint that something might be funny. Little by little though, the laughs went to silence and people understood they were watching a drama, not a comedy. Indeed there were scenes that made you laugh, but the more important scenes were those that take you by the heart and make you feel and understand. Thanks to the great acting by Ryan Gosling, Emily Mortimer, Paul Schneider, Patricia Clarkson, all the supporting cast, you get a feel of a community of neighbors, friends, family, perhaps too idealized, but nevertheless, giving hope and warmth.",/review/rw1872586/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2007,madbeast,10," Touching and Original
","This is one of the most remarkably original films that I have ever seen, providing a refreshing comment that we can learn and expand our horizons from each other if we approach everyone's foibles with a degree of kindness. It is laugh-out-loud funny, but it is also thought-provoking and moving.",/review/rw1872586/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2008,DaveDiggler,7," Love is a Weird Thing, Especially When it's Real
","""Lars and the Real Girl"" may come off as an unrealistic, over-the-top, completely unfathomable fairytale for the mentally ill while the line between realism and fantasy is tightly walked. Some of the actions of the characters are questionable- mostly with the way the townspeople treat Lars and his delusions. Lars is incredibly shy. He sits alone in the dark. He'll make up any excuse he can muster to avoid even a simple breakfast at his brother's house (He lives in the garage; separated from the house of course, and completely isolated / detached from human contact). Lars struggles to connect with people, which is due to years of neglect from his father, and the death of his mother during child birth. His brother left the first chance he got, so Lars has never felt love, nor has he been given the chance to share his love for others.",/review/rw1872586/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2007,zeedunn,10," Yes, a blow-up doll will make you cry
","If anyone had told me I would one day be crying during a movie about a man and his blow-up doll, I would have called them a liar. But, here I am, going through at least 3 Kleenex even after the movie is over. Lars and the Real Girl is a touching, quirky film that is a lesson in why people do the things they do. Anyone that is interested in social work, counseling, psychology, or ministry should watch this movie.",/review/rw1872586/?ref_=tt_urv

1 February 2009,moonspinner55,8," Something wholly unique and wonderful...
","Acts of compassion in a sweet charade. A small town man named Lars, so isolated from human contact that he recoils from love and sympathy of any kind, stuns his brother and sister-in-law with the news he met a woman on the internet--unfortunately, she's really a sex doll Lars imagines to be the perfect girl for him. Ryan Gosling delivers a fully-realized lead performance; shying away from friends and family for fear of being pitied, his quirky half-smiles and quick movements tell people, ""leave me be."" It's a character we come to know so well, we can anticipate his feelings and reactions without getting broad hints (it's Oscar-caliber work). Also fantastic, Paul Schneider and Emily Mortimer as Lars' family and Kelli Garner as a co-worker with a little crush. They all fall in love with ""Bianca"" as a favor to their hermit friend, until that time comes when he may not need her anymore. Melancholic comedy-drama from screenwriter Nancy Oliver and director Craig Gillespie is a true original: never condescending, almost maddeningly even-keeled and sweetly judged, the picture works best if approached as a modern fairy tale (cynics, or those seeking realism, need not apply). Lars' emergence from the cocoon is lovely to behold, and the film is winning, touching, and funny. ***1/2 from ****",/review/rw1872586/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2007,angela-373,9," Don't let the synopsis put you off
","There is just no way to explain the plot of this film and not have it sound rather silly and this film is anything but foolish frivolity. I found it utterly charming and carefully and delicately directed. There are moments of belly shaking humor and quiet tears as Ryan Gosling brilliantly evolves from a reclusive soul with the help of a silicone woman and a kind hearted community. I want to know these endearing people. There is a moral point to this film, perhaps more than one. Don't be put off by the synopsis, or trailer. This is not your standard Hollywood fare. See it for the humor, or the humanity, either way, you will be glad you did. I see very, very few films twice- this one is on my list.",/review/rw1872586/?ref_=tt_urv

","Lars is a loner. When we first meet him, he is living in a small cabin next to the old family home now occupied by his brother, Gus, and his pregnant wife. Karin, the sister-in-law, wants him to be a part of the family, but she barely succeeds in getting him to respond. This young man has a social problem that makes him keep to himself. His mother had died delivering him, and his father has just passed away.

10 June 2013,phd_travel,10," Funny touching original
","Initially I thought the premise might be silly and wear thin quickly but this movie turned out to be a real gem. A man buys a doll and is convinced she is his girlfriend. His brother, sister in law, doctor and the town community all help him through his delusion by going along with it. The community spirit is so touching. There are so many funny moments throughout that just are pure laugh out loud. It's a humane a look at mental and emotional issues.",/review/rw1872586/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2007,DICK STEEL,9," A Nutshell Review: Lars and the Real Girl
","I'd bet almost everyone during their childhood years would have interacted with their toys somehow, be it outwardly verbal, or playing it all in the mind. Conversations with dolls, teddy bears, or even with G.I. Joe himself beating up Cobra Commander, these are stuff of what a rich imagination would be made of, breathing a form of consciousness onto inanimate objects.",/review/rw1872586/?ref_=tt_urv

","You know, this odd story was charming for the first 45 minutes but then it got to be too much. I'm talking overboard, over-the-top, ludicrous - whatever you want to call it - to the point it was an insult to any intelligent viewer. It became, ""Oh, come on...."" as scenes got more ridiculous by the minute.",/review/rw1872586/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2007,coco89136,," Lars and the Real Girl
","I just saw this movie last night with friends and I'll admit I'd never heard of it. I knew it was worth watching when I was told Ryan Gosling was in it so I was mildly excited to see it. The first thirty minutes of the film are pretty damn funny and to some, almost hilarious. Very well done comedic acting that is real, believable, and still amazing to watch. Part of what makes the first thirty minutes so funny is because we know about the doll, and we can't wait for the first reactions. After that the story takes a wonderfully surprising turn to a really touching light drama. I was very surprised but I really loved it. A lot of people laughed throughout the film, and I was very much bothered by that. There is a reason this man is pretending that a ""sex"" doll is a real person, and its a very internal serious pain thats hes going through, which for me, understanding that part of the story, I felt it was mildly inappropriate for people to laugh, but I understood with time. Near the end of the film it gets a little predictable for one, some would say major, plot turn, but not so predictable as to ruin it. About 5 to 10 minutes before it happens you see it coming, but other than that it was superbly acted by Ryan Gosling who has nothing but an incredible career in front of him, and good supporting roles as well. This is a very enjoyable film, which I recommend to anyone and everyone. It really seems to have something for everyone, but be prepared it might make you laugh, cry, or both. Its a very very good movie, and definitely worth seeing in theaters.",/review/rw1872586/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2007,no1voice,9," 'Being There' for a new generation.
","I just saw a screening in LA and a packed house of SAG members LOVED this film! Ryan Gosling's performance hearkens back an equally moving and effective performance from Peter Sellers in Being There, which Gosling and director Craig Gilespie admitted was about their only reference point. Gosling's character is sweet, good natured, and painfully shy and is the heart and soul of this film. His performance as Lars (along with patient direction and a wonderful script) is the prime reason that it all works. I laughed HARD throughout, but by the end I shed real tears over the plot and characters - and I thought doing so over a talking pig was bad! This is a performance WAY out of the ordinary for Gosling, and most of today's young actors could not have pulled it off. Expect an Oscar nomination for Gosling and for the screenplay.",/review/rw1872586/?ref_=tt_urv

20 August 2021,AscendeSuperius,6," Great but too dragged out
","I really liked how this film really focused a lot on a very sensitive topic. Mental illness, with all its struggles, help to unite the people together in the face of adversity, all to help Lars. How the community just came together for him, that was unbelievably touching. The acting too, was superb. An all around, mostly great film.",/review/rw1872586/?ref_=tt_urv

28 November 2007,EUyeshima,9," Expert Ensemble Brings a Delicate Heart to a Most Original Work
","This 2007 film's askew sensibilities and deadpan manner will be familiar to anyone who has watched HBO's Six Feet Under with any regularity since six episodes were written by the film's screenwriter, Nancy Oliver. However, coupled with Craig Gillespie's thoughtful and gently sauntering direction, her script has an added dimension of humanism that grounds the preposterous-sounding concept of a socially awkward, small-town bachelor who becomes enamored with a blow-up doll. The premise would seem ideal for Jim Carrey or Will Ferrell, but this is not a flat-out, slapstick comedy. It's actually a whimsical allegory that touches on serious issues related to emotional isolation and the unacknowledged inability to handle personal loss.",/review/rw1872586/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2008,Gordon-11,," A beautiful film, when it is viewed with an open mind

11 May 2008,zetes,5," I never bought into the concept
","Ryan Gosling plays Lars, a man with a severe social disorder. He usually avoids contact with people, even his brother (Paul Schneider) and sister-in-law (Emily Mortimer). But then Lars orders a sex doll from the internet, and he pretends that she is real and is his girlfriend. The local doctor (Patricia Clarkson) suggests that everyone in the small town in which they live go along with the delusion, hoping Lars is just working things out in his head. It's kind of a cute concept, but, honestly, I could never buy into it. First off, before the sex doll arrives, Lars seems weird but not so crazy as to do as he does. A person so removed from reality probably wouldn't attend church every week, and certainly wouldn't be able to hold down a regular job in an office. And while I might buy that some of the people close to Lars would go along with the game, it's not easy to buy that everyone in town would be happy about it. There are numerous scenes with the town's children, the most literal-minded members of the human species, sitting around not even questioning the situation, including one bizarre scene in which she is supposedly reading aloud to kids without Lars even there. Then there's this one character, played by the lovely young Kelli Garner, who has a crush on Lars from the beginning of the film. Instead of reacting with horror at Lars's girlfriend and running away, she is, while at first shocked, eventually charmed by it. People just don't act like real people in this film. And even if I could buy into it all, I felt that the film was too repetitive, always cutting to unfunny reaction shots of a new person meeting Bianca, which is what Lars calls the doll, or even less funny reaction shots of the doll itself. The performances are generally good. I think Gosling, who was fantastic in his Oscar-nominated performance in Half Nelson, relies a bit too much on method acting, with his constant blinking and whatnot. One might call him Chaplinesque at times, like in the scene where he pretends to bring Garner's teddy bear back to life. But I was more thinking of Johnny Depp pretending to be Chaplin in Benny & Joon, which is a similar but much better movie. The only actor who rises above the mediocre material is Emily Mortimer, who is the only one, in my opinion, who sells the concept. I really believed that she would care enough about her brother-in-law to go along with his delusion. It's her finest performance yet in a career I'm sure will become much bigger.",/review/rw1872586/?ref_=tt_urv
