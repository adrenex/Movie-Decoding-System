20 November 2018,ryansalamence,6," Good with missed potential
","Cam (2018) follows a camgirl who awakes one day to discover she's been replaced on her show with an exact replica of herself. This horror film introduces a haunting and highly intriguing scenario. Although the mystery itself is captivating, the conclusion is underwhelming as the film avoids any delivery of answers. The direction and cinematography were surprisingly fantastic, with the aesthetic of the cam rooms making for some beautiful shots and sets. I also really enjoyed the social commentary on how online sex workers are viewed and how they're forced to lead dual lives due to the stigma associated with the profession. Some better writing and a more solid third act could really change this film from good to great.",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2018,jrmeretis,6," Interesting and engaging, except for the disappointing ending
","The ending just left everything hanging. There were too many loose ends and no explanations. I'm fine with films that maybe don't explicitly explain everything, but where the viewer can figure it out on its own based on the clues given. But this wasn't like that. There were no clues or hints or anything",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2020,ksgillihan,6," I think I know what this movie is about, maybe.
","From the beginning of the movie everything is very straight-forward. A cam girl tries to grow her popularity in an online cam girl website. She tries everything to climb the leader board including faking suicide. Nothing seems to help her crack the top 50. She tries a few more things but sees her popularity only go down. When she decides to do something that is clearly against her better judgement, she begins to unravel. Soon she notices that an exact double of her has hijacked her very own account and is posting videos instead of her. She is obviously very confused and tries to find out what is going on.",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2018,justice_for_allro,9," Object of desire
","At first, I thought this is going to be a straightforward movie about internet dangers or an average clich√© cat and mouse/stalker mystery horror. I was wrong, it is more than that ... it tries to cover many hot subjects of today's society including the desirability in the digital world and how far you are willing to go and expose yourself for fame or money. Inherently, internet dangers and identity theft are presented in a creative way in my opinion.",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2018,BestBenedikt,5," Completely runs off the rails towards the end
","The film starts out quite strong with an interesting concept and keeps you intrigued for about half an hour. Unfortunately it then begins to run off the rails up until the climax, where I just didn't know what was going on anymore. The movie doesn't bother giving you any clear answers and ends on a somewhat disappointing note.",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2019,Sleepin_Dragon,6," Very interesting, duff ending though.
","Sometimes you watch a film, and you don't fully understand it, and you certainly wouldn't be able to explain or describe it, Cam is certainly one of those films, but despite those points I enjoyed it. It's a different setup, sometimes people wake up and don't know who they are, where they are etc, Lola wakes up, and finds that someone's pinched her webcam details, and bizarrely is somehow imitating her.",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2018,Hajimoto0625,8," Well done - Better than I expected
","I don't quite get where all of the terrible reviews are coming from. I guess if you need your movies tied up with a pretty red bow at the end, then you might not like this one. but if you like to have your thoughts provoked a bit, then definitely give this a watch. Personally, I 'got' the ending. I enjoy metaphors, and this story had a big one. But besides that...",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2018,Andrew_Wiper,5," Kind of intriguing, a little creepy, weak ending.
","Weird, kind of intriguing to watch, also kind of cringe worthy at the same time. It kept me guessing a little bit, and I guess this is what kept me watching to the end. By the end of the movie though I wish I hadn't. I feel like they had the opportunity to go in a different direction with this and they chose the ending that you see in the movie. Kind of ruined it for me. I feel like women may actually appreciate this movie more than guys, funny enough because it's web cam girl(s) modelling their bodies. I could be wrong about this though. I watched it until the end, so I'll give it a pass. 5/10",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2018,jacobwadsworth,3," 3 stars is me being very lenient!
","I actually enjoyed the first 30-50 minutes, had me thinking so many different things throughout, but then the ending became so stupid, I'm becoming very frustrated with these terrible endings with modern horror/thriller movies, luckily imdb reviewer's are more than likely spot on so in future I shall read them before watching a film!",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2019,jtindahouse,6," Interesting, but ultimately pointless
","'Cam' was a film that was always going to be judged very heavily by how it ended. The reason for this is that it sets itself up in such a bizarre and fascinating way that the audience is desperate to get a satisfying conclusion. The film is very similar to 2013's 'Enemy' in terms of the story, but is also very different to that film in the sense that that film had a definitive purpose, reasoning and point.",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2019,zidane_mohmad_1991,3," I think the critics accounts were hacked
","I don't like horror movies a lot, but the story of ''Cam'' attract me to watch it, firstly there is no any horror in the movie, it must be classified as a mystery movie, secondly they didn't explain clearly the attack, who, how and why they did it (weak plot), finally the end was more silly than you imagine.",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2018,lollipopmkb,4," Interesting idea.. disappointing ending.. Kinda regrets watching the whole thing
","Good plot, amazing actress, but the ending basically doesn't explain anything. It's like the movie has been cut into two halves except the second half is none existent",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2018,gcatelli,9," Cam 2018 is meant to be fantasy; not documentary
","I don't understand why so many reviewers are having such a hard time getting their arms around this excellent fantasy-thriller. Does ""Frankenstein"" explain why sewing bits and pieces of corpses together and then running high voltage thru the result produces a living being? Does ""Night of the Living Dead"" really make any sense at all? Or, ""The Manchurian Candidate?"" ""Blue Velvet""?",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2018,ramonvm-296-803998,4," Disappointing ending
","Most of the movie was interesting, bu everything goes down at the end. Nothing is explained, and you end up feeling that you wasted your time",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2018,arungeorge13,5," Interesting concept, lacklustre finish! [+51%]
","I was beginning to think this was one of those dark web films (a la Unfriended 2) with a rushed ending, and I wasn't exactly proved wrong. The ending clearly was rushed, and it DID NOT provide closure. Spoiling it also doesn't make sense because you sat through 85 minutes to understand the reasons for all that was happening. I do not mean to say I dislike films with ambiguity, but this was not even ambiguous in the 'clever film-making' sense.",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2018,kannibalcorpsegrinder,8," Solid and enjoyable psychological thriller
","Working as a cam-girl, a young woman determined to raise up the ranks of the website rankings suddenly finds her world turned upside down when she gets locked out of the account and a far more sexually explicit series of shows starring a doppelganger of hers at the center of the exploits.",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2018,MadMike77,5," Cheap Tittillation
","The movie was interesting for the most part, as it could've gone down a really dark path, but in the end it does nothing but glorify the fact you don't need talent to gain fame and fortune, which is so typical in this internet age.",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2018,lionking8142002,," Say the right words, will you!
",Why can't Lola tell everyone she was HACKED...geez! What is up with this movie!,/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2018,pierre-69492,2," What did I just watch!?
","So, basically, not a single explanation of what is going on, a random ending... At first it was sorta intriguing (mostly because it reflexes also what happens on real social networks), but after that?
Feels like a BAD Black Mirror episode, stretched to double the length, with half the quality.
Avoid.",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2018,cindylam1967,5," Interesting concept - could have been delivered better
","The doppelganger was a virtual girl. Apparently someone had created an algorithm to figure out how these girls were acting and managed to hijack and determine how they might behave. Like some form of artificial intelligence. It's like stealing their money and identity. It's pretty creepy that someone coul actually do that. I thought her banging her head on the dresser was a bit drastic. Couldn't figure out who had set up the whole scheme though. That bit was confusing. Who was getting the money for the show? They should have been charged with identity theft, stealing profits that should have been rightfully Lola's and account hijacking and defamation. Characterisation could have been better and more interesting.",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2019,tanya-47873,3," Had potential
","The film starts off a little slow to be honest for a one and a half hour film. I think the extended th beginning to make this movie longer, but truly could be done in 40 minutes as it gives the viewer nothing in the end. You watch this whole film and mid way get really into it especially when Baby is revealed to be dead. However the ending was just laziness from the end of the writer. Like wow some mysterious thing did this...but who? Why? It was such a disappointment for a movie with lot of potential. I read an article where the writer said they wanted to focus on the identity stolen aspect and the Alice just doing anything to get that back and not caring why that happened to her. But I just think that's a sorry excuse for a simple ""I'm a lazy writer who didn't know how to end my film well"".",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2018,fierce221,1," This movie is bad.
","Let me begin by saying this movie is NOT a horror in any way, shape, or form. Next, let me tell you that this movie never explains what's going on. It's all just unknown and honestly very stupid. I regret watching this movie and you likely will too. Then the ending was so stupid I had to immediately write this review. If you want a thoughtless, pointless, stupid movie with a lot of boobs in it, watch this movie. Believe me though, as a movie this sucks completely. That's an hour and a half I'll never get back.",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2018,nickg-34826,2," What the hell is going on?
",The movie started out alright....but then just got completely unbelievable and never attempted to explain what was going on. Was it a digital version of her? Was it an actual doppelganger? was it one of her stalkers? what the hell is going on? Horrible second half and even worse ending. Stay away from this crap.,/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
29 February 2020,A_Different_Drummer,9," what the critics used to call a ""sly turn""
","Looking at the gap between critics reviews and members' vote, this is a film most do not quite get. On its surface, it is broadly a ""situation"" story (protagonist stuck in a tricky situation) with subtle undertones of porn. But in fact it is much more. The script, acting, direction, are all first class. Virtually flawless. And the porn trope allows the writers to make a dozen observations on the way we conduct ourselves in modern society. Even, at the 40:00 mark, the CAT seems surprised at the goings-on. The misunderstood ending is entirely consistent with this subtext, those looking for a different ending should have gone to a Bond film. Sly on many levels. Way better than expected.",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2018,breemartell,2," What did I just watch?
","I spent the whole movie wondering what was going on. And at the end of the movie I am left with more questions. There was no resolution, no reason why or how this happened. I'm frustrated I spent an hour and a half watching this",/review/rw4501498/?ref_=tt_urv
