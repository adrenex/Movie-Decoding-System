7 March 2001,SanderStrijbos,," Great TV show
","Dinosaurs is one of my all time favorite comedy shows. Especially the baby (I'm the baby, gotta love me!) is great! The best episode is the one in which the baby turns 2 years old and he becomes out of control. Earl and Fran call the babysitter and what follows is one of the best parodies I've ever seen along with Eekpocalypse Now from the Eek the Cat show (but you gotta have seen 'the Exorcist' for this one). 'The power of rice compels you!'",/review/rw3177775/?ref_=tt_urv

15 November 2010,planktonrules,9," They forgot to make this show suck!
","I have a major bone to pick with ""Dinosaurs"". As it appears to be a kids' show, why did the producers forget to make it totally suck?! After all, there is an unwritten rule that says kids and their parents should not be able to watch and enjoy the same shows. With the exception of this show and ""The Simpsons"", I have noticed that kids' TV must be terrible, broadly written and annoying--such as with shows like ""That's So Raven"", ""Hannah Montana"" and the like. Shame on the creators of ""Dinosaurs"" to have imaginative characters, LOTS of inside jokes for adults, great Henson-created costumes and FUN! However, since the show only lasted two seasons, it appeared if some big-wigs at ABC realized their mistake and promptly canceled the show. Good for you--as this will insure insipid programming for our kids.",/review/rw3177775/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2006,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,9," An absolute ABC classic!
","""DINOSAURS,"" is my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I don't think I've seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always funny when a mishap occurred. I always laughed at that. Despite the fact that it was a short-lived series, it was nice that all the main characters stayed with the show throughout its entire run. It seems that no one stays with a show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the characters and everything about them were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope they bring it back on the air for fans of the show to see.",/review/rw3177775/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2003,arkay,10," One of the greatest shows ever
","I'm still wondering why they ever decided to cancel this great show.  It had great production value (those dinosaurs look really great, and this is pre-CGI) and it's one of the funniest shows I've ever seen.  I still enjoy watching the reruns on German TV.",/review/rw3177775/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2000,Thanos6,," One of the ten greatest sitcoms ever.
","This show is hilarious!  Whether it's Baby hitting Earl with a frying pan while saying, ""Not the mama!"" or Robbie accidentally becoming leader of a gang, or Charlene and Fran having another discussion about money... ...this is a show that was guaranteed to make me laugh out loud.  People say it's a ripoff of the Simpsons.  Well, in my view it's BETTER than the Simpsons.",/review/rw3177775/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2019,rdoubleoc,10," I'll never forget this show, EVER.
","Stuart Pankin's voice is forever cemented into my mind because of this show. One of my fondest childhood memories is sitting around waiting for dinner to be ready while I watch this show. I really wish there were a show like this today, but I just can't think of any that even come close to feeling or being the same way.",/review/rw3177775/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2005,raypdaley182,," If you haven't seen it, buy the video's!
","Our dinosaur family are as follows Earl, a megalosaurus. Earls name I'd always heard as Earl Sneath Sinclair (not Sneed as the trivia says). Fran (who we didn't know if she had a middle name), Robbie (Robert Mark Sinclair), Charlene (no, no middle name there either) and Baby Sinclair (who was originally named Argh, argh, I'm Dying you idiot Sinclair). Family friends Roy Hess a t-Rex, Monica Devertaborough (some sort of diplodocus or bronotsaurus). Other people included Ethel Phillips (Fran's mum) and B.P. Richfield (earl's boss, a triceratops who seems to be a carnivore). Howard Handupme (a TV presenter of news), Spike (school bully & friend to Robbie), Mister Lizard ( a science presenter) and Timmy (who Mister Lizard kills in every episode, WE LOVE IT!)",/review/rw3177775/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2006,gparob,9," Sharp satire, yet you can watch with your kids.
","Just like my favorite romance movie, the Princess Bride, or even Rocky and Bullwinkle for that matter, here's a show that's clearly written for two completely different audiences- the kids that love them, and the parents that watch with them. If you want the most cutting example of this, watch the Dinosaurs episode in which a Barney-like animal (a Hippo, if I remember right?)hosts a daytime TV kiddie show, but he's really a manipulative bad guy when the TV cameras are off. Throw in the French Resistance, complete with horrible Clouseau-like frrrrench accents, and, well, you get the idea. Absurdist humor at it's best. I guarantee you'll laugh at this one.",/review/rw3177775/?ref_=tt_urv

13 November 2004,ellemanzo,," it was great show
","'Dinosaurs' was a great show, it really was. And not some copycat on 'The Simpsons.' I was quite young when the show began and ended, and it was an all time favorite of mine. I loved it b/c it was so funny. Many episodes had messages about our society today. Even though I was little, and there were some things I didn't get, I still remember those shows. Like this one episode where Earl, the dad, went and bought the two animals, considered delicacies, for his and Fran's anniversary. It turns out that they are the last of their kind, so Robbie tries to protect them. Sadly, Earl's boss eats them. But not before Robbie persuades them to reproduce and when Earl comes home with a heavy heart and trying to tell Robbie and tragic news, the adorable offspring hatch from their eggs. Or two episodes where Earl is arrested for bad parenting and the one with Robbie being head or the household. This show was good, but it was underrated and now, not even a decent number lousy fan site is out and about with it.",/review/rw3177775/?ref_=tt_urv

5 August 2000,gavinpage,," Fantastic, this was one of the funniest show on TV shame they don't make them anymore!
","This show was fantastic, really funny with the baby being the funniest character, he was always hitting Earl Sinclair on the the head with a frying pan and saying ""Not the Mamma"". Its just a shame the cancelled it and you can't get the videos anymore.",/review/rw3177775/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2006,RSBlain,10," Outstanding, ranking with ""best family entertainment aired""
","I was thrilled to see ""the Dinosaurs"" being re-published on DVD. As an adult of 62 years I know cartoon characters are a little far fetched for an interest. I am, as an adult of 62 years, not only fond of the Dinosaurs but ""just plain crazy about them"". The characters and moral teaching done within all of the episodes was outstanding and human and highly entertaining. Sitting here writing, I am not speaking of a single episode but of every episode that was aired. I can't think of a better teaching tool for values or better entertainment for children or adults. There is no blood and guts, no bad language, wonderful animation, no dysfunctional family but real togetherness all done in the most heartwarming ways. I am remembering so many of the stories as I write and can't fault a single one.",/review/rw3177775/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2003,muppets3377,," ""Dinosaurs"" is one of the funniest series ever to be aired on TV!
","The comedy never ends in this amazing show--it ranges from small but hilarious expressions to in-depth jokes. The characters are entertaining and believable, and their situations are unique and enhanced by their different ways of dealing with them. The dinosaurs themselves are very realistic, and make you want to truly believe in their prehistoric world that is so much like our own. There are also important and much-needed lessons to be learned from this wonderful show, and the humour is almost completely clean.",/review/rw3177775/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2006,goomack14,10," The best t.v. show in 65 million years
","Possibly one of the greatest concepts in television history. It is a beautifully done show; with amazing characters, set, and stories. The most important thing about this show is the social satire that it puts forth... It is on the same par as the Simpsons and South Park for making one think about social norms in the US society and world culture... the final thing I will say about the show is that there isn't a laugh track in the background, it can be a little weird if you haven't seen the show in a while, but then you realize how brilliant the show is...it's just an honest and wholesome show for everyone. Get it for the kids, get it if you remember the early 90's and want to remember how awesome it was, or get it for the first time and learn how good t.v. can be.",/review/rw3177775/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2014,chodefacemcgee69,9," An original and funny early 90's sitcom.
","I'm going to echo what a lot of other reviewers are saying and just simply state that Dinosaurs was a very good TV show. I'll be honest, though, and say that in my opinion it's not particularly the most laugh-out-loud funny sitcom I've ever seen, and it doesn't have the same emotional impact as some other shows of a similar nature. For example - I've never felt quite the same emotional resonance as I did some some of the more sensitive-themed episodes of similar sitcoms, such as how much more I felt very sorry for Will Smith in several of the more emotional episodes of Fresh Prince (which overall was a very lighthearted and funny show as well), than I ever did for any of the Sinclair family members.",/review/rw3177775/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2013,SanteeFats,9," Funny
","I love this series. The animatronics are fantastic. The humor is great and the characters have well developed personalities. The baby is especially funny with his antics and wisecracks. The mother in law is really funny once she joins the family after Earl can not hurl her into the tar pit. This show reminds me very much of the Honeymooners with Jackie Gleason and Art Carney. Of course Earl is not a bus driver and his buddy is not a sewer worker but listen to the voices and the type of give and take and I think you will see what I mean. The two older kids are so typically teenagers that they actually seem to resonate with today's teens. The talking and thinking ""food"" is well done. I like when Spike shows up and befriends Robby, shades of the Fonz.",/review/rw3177775/?ref_=tt_urv

","I absolute love this serie as a kid. Its funny and smart, with good insight about the society that for me, as a child, was important to notice and question. Like working relations, gender, capitalism. The series do that with inteligence to please kids and adults",/review/rw3177775/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2008,tawdry_hepburn,9," Great show! A big part of my childhood, and still great as an adult.
","There are a lot of things I love from my childhood. Turns out, most of them suck. I'm not much for hanging onto something just because it makes me happy. There are a few things here and there, I can't let go of my love for Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont's work (""Can't Hardly Wait"", ""Josie and the Pussycats"") for example. But most of the time, I look back at something I loved as a kid and it turns out to be unwatchable tripe.",/review/rw3177775/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2013,VenVes,," Gem of the 90's
","Wow cannot believe I never watched this show before... ""Dinosaurs."" Amazing commentary at least on par with if not better than South Park (plus it doesn't rely on pop culture). It doesn't even matter if you watch with kids, because they'll still find it amusing and yet it's filled to the brim with insider jokes for adults and in my opinion they still crack you up as much as SP albeit in a less vulgar manner. I should stress this show is for people who are open-minded about watching dated visuals and special effects, as the show simply overrides these faults with the rest of it's material. I on the other hand, love most everything about it, and consider it a gem.",/review/rw3177775/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is one of those magical shows that has the perfect mix of writing, cast & crew that comes together far too seldom and provides you with something that's about as sublime as can be mustered. Also, it entertains on many levels so that anyone watching will be able to laugh at, and learn from, each episode.",/review/rw3177775/?ref_=tt_urv
