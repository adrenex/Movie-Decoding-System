11 December 2005,MinorityReporter,7," X-ellent entertainment!
","If this film had been given to the wrong director it could have been incredibly cheesy. Being a reader of the comics I know that there are a few things that works on the page of a comic book but not in a film and let me say that the costumes is one of these things that in all probability wouldn't work. Singer chose to go with black leather outfits and I, for one, am very thankful for this choice. There are many things in this film that works but unfortunately there are a few things as well that prevent the film from being truly great.",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2019,Animany94,8," A lot better than expected.
","After watching a lot of animated X-Men stuff, I thought that it was time to watch some live-action movies. I'd heard rumours that the X-Men franchise was rather hit and miss. Well, this was a very solid start.",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv

","Though ""X-Men"" starts slowly, the slow buildup and great payoff proved that this film is worthy of the successful franchise it spawned.",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2000,Chiron1987,," Lee and Kirby's Finest Creation Comes to Life...
","The film version of Stan Lee and Jack ""The King"" Kirby's best-selling comic book creation, X-Men, has finally succeeded where more than twenty years of four-color, superhero movies have failed.  They have finally got it right...",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," X-Men
","I find X-men a good start to the x-men franchise since it brings the characters we all know in love from the comics or even the old animated TV show of x-men with people like the wolverine, jean grey or mystique, all of which we know from the comics and I get why some people say now that it doesn't really have good CGI anymore but in my opinion I honestly think that it still has good animation till this day. I give X-men 2000 10/10 stars, For its good story and how they put such good casting in this movie.",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2000,Crave,," intelligent and significant
","With so many movies out right now that are designed solely for entertainment puposes--from ""Gone in 60 seconds"" to ""MI-2"" to ""Scary Movie""--it is promising to sit through a 90-minute film based on a comic-book that actually gives you an opportunity to think and be challenged.",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2006,ccthemovieman-1,8," A Treat For The Eyes & Ears
","Special-effects and terrific 5.1 surround sound are the highlights of this science fiction film. And what highlights they are - tremendous in both categories, at least for 2000 when this film and DVD came out. At the time, they were the best special-effects I had ever seen, but strides are being made so fast in that category that every few years we movie fans are stunned at something new we see. Audio-wise, the rear speakers come into to play as well as any movie I've heard.",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2000,odradek-4,10," X-cellent!
","A tale of super-evolved mutants in a struggle against human oppressors, X-Men is an instant sci-fi classic, combining impressive special effects with an involving plot to create a truly memorable cinematic experience.",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2000,infinitesc,10," Not a ""Comic-book Movie""
","There's no doubt about it, X-Men is not a stereotypical ""comic-book film"". Whenever a movie is made that is based on comic books, there is always a fear that it can and will be typically pigeonholed into the ""comic book film"" genre and that the movie is basically made for the fans of that comic book.  Comic-book films are usually unrealistic and unappealing to the general audience.",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2000,cherry2x,9," Can your comic heros really come to life?
","The answer to that question can be found in this movie with a resounding YES.  Being a fan of X-Men comics and cartoons, I watched this movie with great skepticism.  It was wonderful how the characters remained true to the comics.",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2015,Hitchcoc,8," The Start of Something Big
","My son brought me into the foray of comic book movies. I had low expectations. This one is quite expository, bringing us into contact with the principles of the X-men. We are introduced to Wolverine and the lot. The plot involves all of the planning, government meddling, and super-villains with whom I am not familiar. One thing that impressed me is the quality of the acting and the big time performers that contributed to this. It does leave unanswered questions, but I would assume there are answers galore as the blockbusters of the day seem to be about 90 percent directed to fanboys. I really enjoyed this, but am still a bit bewildered by who these guys are.",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2014,BA_Harrison,8," A great start to the franchise.
","Telepathic, follically-challenged, wheelchair-bound genius Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) aims to promote the peaceful co-existence of mutants and humans, teaching students at his School for Gifted Youngsters how to control their powers. Angry metal-bending mutant Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) has other ideas: he wants to transform the world's political leaders into genetic freaks so that they will no longer show prejudice against his kind.",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2014,TheLittleSongbird,7," A solid start to the X-Men film franchise
","Not one of the best Superhero films but a long way from one of the worst. While with imperfections and better was to follow in the franchise, X-Men is a good film and a solid start though with a yet-to-properly-find-its-feet feel. X-Men is well-made, the special effects while not mind-blowing are great, the film was slickly shot and edited and the dark, moody visual style worked wonders. Michael Kamen's music score had those grand, mysterious, rousing and haunting qualities that really add a lot to the film's atmosphere. Apart from the odd cheesy moment the dialogue is smart and taut with some subtle humour that thankfully did not feel out of place, and Bryan Singer shows that he does know how to direct an action sequence, tell a good story and not let the special effects overwhelm everything, a solid directing job indeed. The story, while simple compared to what was to follow in the succeeding films, is compelling and doesn't try and take itself too seriously or like a joke. The character exposition was nicely done on the whole and doesn't drag things down too much, Cyclops, Storm and Toad are underdeveloped but Wolverine and especially Magneto(who actually has depth to him rather than being a clich√©d villain) are interesting characters. The relationships between the characters were also believable, Wolverine and Rogue's was a standout. And the story didn't feel like it was second fiddle to the action sequences, which weren't big and bold as such but were tightly choreographed and performed with spirit and passion. Admittedly though the Statue of Liberty climax while strikingly filmed is on the silly side at times, but it was fun too. The cast are mostly very good, apart from a stiff James Marsden(he and Famke Janssen's chemistry was very bland), a monotone Tyler Mane and Halle Berry and Ray Park also felt a bit bland. Hugh Jackman however shows great charisma as the lead character Wolverine and has a powerful screen presence, Rebecca Romijin-Stamos is a sexy and icy Mystique, Anna Paquin did bring a feistiness to Rogue and Famke Janssen is fine. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen promise much on paper, and both of them deliver, Stewart brings a cool, classy command to the screen as Professor X but even better is McKellen, who is certainly menacing but gives Magneto a sympathetic edge. To conclude, a good film and a solid start to the franchise. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2006,jezre_17,8," A Very Good Introduction, but you do feel that something is missing
","It is a great challenge to make the first episode of a superhero series, why? You have the pressure of making it believable, entertaining, dramatic, exciting, you know what...",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2016,Leofwine_draca,6," A satisfying piece of light entertainment
","Here's a cinematic rarity: a comic strip getting a successful big screen treatment. It doesn't happen very often, but we're finally at the stage of CGI technology to actually make an effects-intensive movie like this work, and look ""right"". This is a film never designed to win any awards for the script, direction, or acting abilities, yet instead appeal to the crowds as a fun, exciting way to spend one hundred minutes of your life. And with a film like this, the biggest impact comes watching it on the big screen. I've never been a fan of the X-Men comics or television series myself, which is why I was surprised about enjoying this film. The characters are clear cut, easy to identify with and, most of all, extremely cool. For a blockbuster film like this it's rare to find characterisation, but (gasp) it does occur here, chiefly with the character of Wolverine, who is given most screen time. Hugh Jackman is excellent in the role, bringing the right balance of instability, anger, love, and honour to his character, and he's also very charismatic as well. And that's not mentioning the great big bloody spike things which frequently shoot out of his knuckles.",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2018,matthewssilverhammer,8," Never Better...Until Logan
","There's so much great stuff in this, which is the ACTUAL first movie to set the tone for super-serious superhero films. Jackman was a revelation, the faded line between good and evil, Kelly's body horror scene, Magneto in whole, etc etc etc. But above all, it boasts one of the greatest superhero films openings ever at Auschwitz. Even with some good entries in between, the X-Men franchise never got better until Logan.",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2020,cotandreea,10," I think it was a very interesting movie
","I think it was a very interesting movie because of the theme: discrimination of mutants. Also this movie shows how people can make it or break it in this century and why is important to be kind with people. This subject matter is very relatable even in 2020, because of the politics. Thank you guys for a great movie!",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2002,bob the moo,," Dark comic book adaptation
","In the near future, where children are being born with a special X-Factor in their genes, giving them special powers, and making them ""mutants"", the seeds of a new Holocaust are being sewn by Senator Robert Kelly. The situation brings fellow mutants and former friends Erik Lehnsherr, a.k.a. Magneto, and Professor Charles Xavier into opposition. While Xavier seeks to stop the hatred toward mutants peacefully, Magneto seeks to even things out, with a machine that would speed up the mutation process in all humans, making everyone equal. To stop Magneto, Xavier brings together a special group of mutants called ""X-Men"" to stop him.  Two mutants with dangerous powers, Logan and Rogue arrive at Xavier's retreat seeking refuge.",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2006,J. Spurlin,," The usual tedious superhero blockbuster for humorless, fun-hating fanboys
","Fanboys have no sense of fun. It's partly their influence that makes these superhero tales increasingly self-important and witless. If you flip through comic books today, you'll find they tackle issues such as drug addiction, street crime, racial bigotry and homosexuality, all while muscle-bound louts in circus costumes are flying around and shooting laser beams out of their fists. And no one fights crime any more; they just wrestle with their own demons. I recently scanned a comic book where an old Superman and a young Superman were throwing trucks and boulders at each other as they screamed pop-psych jargon about their grievances in what seemed like an apocalyptic episode of ""Dr. Phil.""",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2001,melissa3,8," I gave this film an 8.
","I've always been a fan of the X-Men, since the Animated Series aired (I'd never really read any of the comics though... ^_^). So when I heard they were making a movie about them, I was counting the days until it was released. Maybe that affected how I viewed the movie, but I was a bit disappointed. Director Brian Singer (Usual Suspects) did a good job with what he's got... the multiple characters, etc. The whole project seems a bit ""safe,"" though, as if the producers wanted to make sure this big production didn't flop. It's a good movie, but not a great one. Fans of the X-Men might be especially disappointed if their favorite characters do not include either Wolverine or Rogue. Mine personally is Cyclops, but he had a minor role. James Marsden, who played Cyclops, was a bit on the stiff side, but I forgive him because I like him as an actor. On that note, all the actors did an excellent job, especially Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan, as the forces of good and evil. It brought an endearing humanistic side to a story I had thought was dominated by sci-fi. If you're an X-Men fan, I would definitely recommend this film--but you probably have already seen it! What X-Men fan would miss out? If you're not a fan, maybe this movie can be a starting point for a new obsession... :o)",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2013,SnoopyStyle,8," Bryan Singer starts a great franchise
","Based on the Marvel comics, this is a great introduction to these characters. And that's the biggest job in this movie for director Bryan Singer. He needed the right actors to play these characters properly in a viable story. The fact that he did it well meant that a new movie franchise is launched.",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2002,michaelRokeefe,8," Mutants are the future. Mutants are now.
",Mutants become superheroes to fight off a powerful group of organized mutants wanting to take over society as we know it. Some kick ass EFX; sensational fight scenes; head spinning futuristic scenery. Adapted from the long-running Marvel Comics; Psychic Professor Xavier(Patrick Stewart)leads a band of skilled mutants called X-Men with the purpose of protecting the world from evil genetically mutated beings. Xavier's group of warriors each have their own skills and super abilities. It appears the most fearsome is the battler Wolverine(Hugh Jackman); just as Storm(Halle Berry)is the most attractive. The X-Men fight for virtue and all that is right. X-MEN is a treat for the eyes.,/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2019,KeremUlucay,7," FIRST
","X-Men is first superhero team movie in history. Also it is Marvel's first movie with a high budget. Movie is amazing about storytelling, especially in first one hour. I really liked the world they created. But then it becomes a bit meaningless and complicated. CGI's are good for 2000. Actors and actresses are awesome with their roles, every one of them. This film have some surprising scenes, especially with Mistique. Bryan Singer made a good job at all.",/review/rw4942913/?ref_=tt_urv
