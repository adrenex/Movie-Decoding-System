22 July 2017,simonsmith1,10," The Characters make it worth watching.
","This is not weighty, or particularly politically sophisticated, but for a feel good (normally), well made, well scripted series it's good enough to look forward to each week, like meeting up with a friend. The characters in the program are particularly enjoyable and for that alone it's worth at least a try.",/review/rw4751303/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2014,phd_travel,5," Watchable but a bit patronizing
","Compared to other female lead political dramas, this is more believable than 'State of Affairs' with Katherine Heigl and less heavy handed than 'Commander in Chief' with Geena Davis. I like the intelligent look Tea Leoni has. She is slightly too attractive but nevertheless very watchable Secretary of State and ex CIA agent. Her kids are a little annoying especially the eldest daughter. Her husband played by Tim Daly is also some undercover NSA agent. Current headline areas of international diplomatic conflict are incorporated into the episodes. The flaw is in some of the writing. She seems to be able to solve major problems independently of the President. Also there is a slightly patronizing tone. Diplomats from other countries are portrayed as rather pig headed and unreasonable and she is shown to be the voice of reason. Maybe showing her being on the wrong side in the international arena occasionally would make it more rounded and less of a fairy tale.",/review/rw4751303/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2014,brenda_grant,9," Looking forward to seeing MORE
","I don't understand why people are giving poor reviews, maybe they have only viewed the pilot. They could have expanded more, but people should not be so quick to leave a review after only seeing 60 minutes of a season series. So far I have only viewed the pilot and the first episode, but I am anticipating it will get high reviews. Anyone who enjoys watching the TV series Scandal, should enjoy this series as well. Scandal is quite violent and into shock value. To compare the two shows I find the writing far superior. Tea Leoni was an excellent choice. She is a wonderful actor and I have enjoyed all her movies. She can make you feel the emotions of the script every time.",/review/rw4751303/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2014,Dr_Sagan,," Mild political drama with family and comedy elements.
","This is the fictional story of an ex-CIA analyst who now is a professor in a University and a wife and a mother of 3 teenagers. One day, her mentor in the agency, who now happens to be the president of the U.S. offers her (insisted more like it) the position of the secretary of state.",/review/rw4751303/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2014,merylmck,9," Brilliant - but the description doesn't do it any favours
","I would seriously doubt a show like this with a lead male character would have a synopsis essentially refer to 'work life balance', automatically putting it in the 'career mom struggle' basket. Bess (Madam Secretary), is an extremely well written, complex, political character who happens to wear a skirt sometimes. I really hope people do not dismiss the show without giving it a chance. Yes, it does explore both sides of political life, the professional and the personal, but that kind of exploration makes for layered plot development, and is not gender specific. It may at some stage get irritating the way the State Office consistently seems to be able to achieve positive outcomes to complex global issues in one handy episode, but for now it's just satisfying. And welcome back Tea Leoni, wow!",/review/rw4751303/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2018,lindashadowland,10," This Show Has Always Been Political
","I was reading through the reviews hoping to see some commentary on Elizabeth running for President. Instead I was surprised to see people complaining that the show is becoming too biased politically. This show was always written with a Democratic tone and the concept itself was based on Hillary Clinton. I think if you've been watching and enjoying this wonderful show, but were put off by say, Hillary Clinton making a guest appearance, perhaps you should reconsider boycotting the show. It's the same show with the same liberal themes/outlook it has always had. If you enjoyed it before you identified a liberal leaning plot, nothing has changed. Just for the sake of it, I happen to be an Independent.",/review/rw4751303/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2019,nancyldraper,10," The Best of what TV Can Be
","This is just the best of what TV can be. Full disclosure, I'm Canadian and not a big fan of the political system or climate of US politics, but this series raises an ideal both personal and political that is inspiring. Beyond that the acting is top notch, the chemistry between principals and between the whole cast is infectious. The writing is intelligent and the scope of situations is exhaustive. From the first season, this series has been on my ""Top TV Series"" list and I have looked forward to each episode as it broadcasts. I whole heartedly give this series a 10 (excellent) out of 10. {Drama}",/review/rw4751303/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2015,kodenkan,8," Give it a chance
",This is a great new show that highlights Tea's and Tim's acting chops. I'm glad to see casting chose the talented versus gorgeous actor route and graced them with intelligent crisp dialogue. I'm a guy and it's nice to see a middle aged woman get a leading role.,/review/rw4751303/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2019,disdainisme,1," Was great but not any longer
",Good show but now its too political. I have no idea how they allowed themselves to go down this road but its painful to watch. Leave the bashing at the door. Had decent writing but its an easy skip now. Political one sided bashing,/review/rw4751303/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2015,s3276169,2," A political show or political propaganda.....?
",Depending on your political and personal leanings you may view Madam Secretary from a variety of perspectives. Some may see it as yet another example of bad television. You may perceive it as US propaganda that seeks to justify and excuse this nations meddlesome role in the world today. Perhaps you think its entertaining and maybe you feel its political take on things is fair minded. ,/review/rw4751303/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2018,jacmat-59205,1," Disappointing

","After watching the first two episodes, I find this show to be interesting and entertaining. Its major asset is Tea Leoni, though it has a powerhouse cast.",/review/rw4751303/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2020,ian_maddog79,8," One Season Too Many....
","A series I enjoyed right from the start, good storylines, great cast, however the show should have ended after the 5th season with MSec announcing her bid for the Presidency. The last season seemed laboured and missed characters that had been ever present throughout as well as not so subtlety touching on real politics and current affairs. Last thing I want to mention is how fantastic Zeljko Ivanek (aka Russell Jackson) was throughout the tenure of the show.",/review/rw4751303/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2014,Tactrix,10," Secretary of Checkmate
","This is a show about the secretary of state, the lead Elizabeth(Tea Leoni) is a school teacher and an ex CIA employee who's personally picked by the president to become the secretary of state when her predecessor dies in a car accident. There's a calm nature in Tea that makes her a perfect candidate for this role, she slides into it like it was tailor made for her. Adding to that Henry(Tim Daly) who's her husband in this and a fantastic actor along with their 3 kids it's just a really solid show. ",/review/rw4751303/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2019,electric-crow,5," Officially Jumped the Shark
","When MS first came to TV it was a bit refreshing, a little edgy and obviously an extension of a HR Clinton - like character and their trials and tribulations within the beltway as they rise to the top. The past 5 or 6 episodes though have really exposed the formula........ difficult politician or foreign dignitary - find pressure point - Elizabeth wins again!! It's become way too predictable, melodramatic and obviously is the writers vehicle for throwing shade on the current administration........ not that that is a bad thing but even the choir gets tired of the same song. The latest episode ""Family Separation"" focuses on the title issue at the border with Elizabeth as the martyr. Again in the nick of time someone gives up the goose, the bad guy is shamed and all is well but wait!! Who is that on the stairs playing her favorite song?! A cameo by Peter Frampton, love him but a total jump-the-shark move. Madame Secretary has become a political based version of Joanie Loves Chachi.",/review/rw4751303/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2015,paulcreeden,8," No Hilary or Madeleine
","Tea Leoni can be proud of this production. It is watchable and mostly intelligent. The cutesy 'family values' stuff aside...it is mentally engaging with good timing, good acting and decent writing. Its sharp humor is its best quality. A major flaw is the ""House of Cards"" mimicked music. The young actors are good enough to take the sting out of the unrealistic 'homey' home of the Secretary of State.",/review/rw4751303/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2014,ThomasJeff,1," Logical Problems all over this show.
",I love Tea Leoni. I actually love the premise of this show too. I love the chief of staff and the president character in this show. The issue is that there are logical issues and little quirks about this show that make no sense and seems a bit of deuce ex machinae and religious propaganda which is just strange.,/review/rw4751303/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2014,Kaliani,8," Will wait and see
","Being from Europe and not really interested in the details of US politics, I watched the show simply as entertainment and did not take it too seriously. Too bad some people take it as propaganda, it's only a TV show...",/review/rw4751303/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2014,jdonalds-5,4," It's just not working for me

29 September 2014,aselmani,8," A decent show
","Well, I come from Europe and studied politics and I really don't get why people link this series with the life of Hillary Clinton or any other secretary from before – cannot it no be a simple fiction rather than a necessary mirror of someone's life?",/review/rw4751303/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2019,fly_fisher,1," First few seasons were great...

24 October 2019,liam_nb,8," Low key incredibly exciting
","I was watching this the other day as I'm not all caught up I had the choice between Gotham star trek and this and after watching a few episodes of each this is so so much more exciting than it has the right to be a the characters are brilliantly well written and acted the plots are very much left leaning but they don't take the Mick with it in that SJW corporate way they genuinely add meaningful arguments to it.
In plain this show is gripping and quite hard to stop watching it's definitely one of the better political programs beating out others like designated survivor by far.",/review/rw4751303/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2021,SruthiPrema,9," It's a heart warming tale of a liberal realist foreign affairs minister.
","Being an IR buff, I loved this series. The storytelling, is beautiful as it balances personal and professional lives of a politically active couple. The family is funny and quirky and it's beautiful. It's almost a fairy tale. Then the international relations, it does glorify the American greatness and the stereotypes we have seen before, but does manage to be engaging and interesting. I would suggest you to watch it for the family. It's wonderful!",/review/rw4751303/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2019,chalonlee,5," Political correctness is draining the entertainment value
","The first seasons of this show were solid entertainment. Characters were easy to connect with and nicely balanced. There was solid action and intriguing situations. Unfortunately, the seasons of 2018 and 2019 have gotten increasingly preachy of left-wing political correctness. It has grown tiresome and pedantic.
Please let the characters express themselves in great plot lines and stop being such maudlin leftist do-gooders. You are entertainers. Stop thinking you're more than that- it evokes pity.",/review/rw4751303/?ref_=tt_urv
