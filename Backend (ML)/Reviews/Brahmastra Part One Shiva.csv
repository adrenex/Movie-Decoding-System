9 September 2022,MaheshPanth,2," Overdoing Animation, Lacks Unique Plot, And Disappointment
","I just watched the movie and came out of theatre. Totally disappointed. There's no special plot in the movie. It's just cameo and cameo like stars filled but no real dialogue delivery or fun. Thee VFX are quite good but it seems like trying too hard to show your animation skills, like forcefully overdoing it. Ravir Kapoor, who fits in roles of cute guys, like Barfi and similar love stories is playing a fierce guy in this movie. In no way he does not looks dangerous at all. There's just lighting flying in the skies, the actor is just standing and screaming and fire balls come out of his hands and none of that looks organic, or realistic in a sense. The visual effects are supposed to be confusing people about whether that's real or not. The audience can clearly say that's fake. Any dialogues, worst. It's a disaster and disappointment movie. Waste of 450 crores, save your money.",/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,gsaki-90787,2," Pathetic movie
","Other than VFX, there is no storyline, no engaging screenplay, horrible BGM, and cringy dialogs. Acting is better left unsaid. Had a headache after listening to the jarring BGM and watching non stop laser effects.",/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,abhineet150,4," Visual treat in 3d which misses story line
",Brahmastra is good to watch for 3d only if you are in for visual treat attempted by Bollywood but that's all I have to say.,/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,ankitnailwal,1," Not at all upto the hype
",Movie starts at good pace ....but slowly looses all its hype by dragging the love story of Ranbhir and Alia.,/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,subhadeeproy-80261,5," A mixed bag but mostly on the underwhelming side
","Brahmastra Part One: Shiva, is the movie with both good and bad. Here are my views after the 1st day 1st show watch.",/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,zeeshan-48543,3," Not an orignal one
",It is promoted as bollywood's first of its kind.... but it is totally a copy of PERCY JACKSON AND THE LIGHTENING THIEF.... Where AB is Pierce Brosnan and so on... nothing new here.. 1 star for acting 1 for Direction nd vfx and 1 for music... so 3 star only..... ayan mukherjee and team has put nice effort in the movie but content is the real king maker which is weak in brahmastra....... the think that audience will consume whatever they serve them in the name of science fiction. Thats it.... alia is gorgeous no doubt... mouni roy is also good.... part 2 might be more promising...... as the climax of part one shows you.,/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,vrijeshpatel-66005,5," Mostly focused on romance. Did not go much into ""astras"" overall average
","Vfx was good climax was also good but love angle made it unbearable it was boring in the first half also they did not utilize nagarjun's skill correctly he was only in the film for 20 mins or so. Would have loved to see him more in the film. They could have also reduced the time length. It was too long. Amitabh bachan was good. I loved how he was guiding ranbir's character. He did fabulous job. They did not go much into astras. They just used indian weapons name but didnt show how they were formed Mostly focused on ""love"". Alia bhatt was ok. Dialogue were not good enough. Waiting for part 2 of the series.",/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,aniketrtsimdb,6," Not happy with the dialogues.
","I just got out of watching the first show in my city and was mostly happy with the attempt at a superhero movie by Ayan Mukherjee but the actors and dialogues let the movie down, mostly the dialogue choices were uniform and no steps to innovate were taken. Would have enjoyed it more if I could relate more to the characters in the movie. Even though it is a fantasy movie but the way characters were behaving, the world felt a little too simple with no relation to natural human behaviour. If you are not going to put effort in world building then at least make sure to introduce elements to our existing reality.",/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,solankianshuman,7," Decent start, top notch visuals
",My expectations were pretty high from this movie. Overall i stand somewhere in the middle after watching the movie. The movie is not flawless. It has its ups and down. If we want to compare with western cinema then we should accept that many initial marvel movies were bang average as well.,/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,muhammadshabbir-71875,10," A complete entertainer
","Please don't try to see logic. Just watch the performance of the cutest pair and enjoy the movie. Ranbir has done tremendous job. Alia has also surpassed all her contemporary actresses. Vish kanya is amazing. Amitabh again appears in a most attractive character. And please avoid negative reviews created by hate mongers. Action, romance and thrill... Everything is there. Direction is up to the mark. Dialogues are also superbly written. This movie is rejuvenates very well the hindu belief in the conceptual use of brahmastra at various occasions by hindu dieties. Just focus on the characters played by the actors.",/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,Atripulastya,7," Dont TELL...SHOW!! They forgot. Nonetheless, comendable effort Ayan and the Cast
","I got up at 6 AM in like 8 months just for this movie, as I wanted to catch the 8:30 AM show with an un-influenced mind.",/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,jmpaulvitalis,7," A Landmark Film for Indian Cinema
","Brahmastra is a film that captivated my attention ever since it was first announced. The movie despite its minor flaws lives up to the expectations of being a grand spectacle and almost instantly ensnares you into the magical world of the Astraverse. Witnessing Ayan Mukerji's vision deeply rooted in Indian culture come to life on a massive scale was an enthralling experience, it is not an easy feat to dedicate almost a decade towards a film unless you are truly passionate about the subject material. The highlights of the movie are the visual effects, the background score and the performances of Ranbir , Amitabh and Nagarjuna whereas the downsides of the movie were the dialogues and Alia Bhatt's performance. The movie ends with a cliffhanger , leaving you yearning for the sequel to be released already. On the whole the film is a commendable effort that deserves praise.",/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,gdeep-02296,2," time waste
","Just VFX, Even I don't know which way Bollywood is going, but all the films that have come in the last 2 years are ridiculous, Bollywood will have to think about how to make good films. I can't even call it time waste because it was a film below time waste... Shahrukh khan's acting was Okay but other characters were duin' over acting... no storyline and no sense of direction .... they need to think about roles in this film industry, south cinema is much better than bollywood now... even our punjabi cinema duni' good job in films, bcoz if film's genre was comedy than it must be funny, but this film was seriously too much funny even in action part,",/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,mohinderchugh,," Great VFX No story or good acting
","We were expecting a great movie as the amount of money spent on this movie was insane. But it is more or less disappointment. VFX are great and are equal to any best of Hollywood. But here director missed the trick. He focussed too much on VFX and did not focus on story , acting or Music. Other than acting by superstar No actor including Ranbir and Alia acted well. Big B is a waste in this movie. Music is also copied from other songs of pritam himself.",/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,kevalfsi,1," Not worth the time
","I went to see first day first show! Was excited for movie but it was really a waste of time. It is almost like a cheap marvel copy and nothing more. Its just a love story with vfx. Not satisfied at all. Must work hard for next adition to this triology and not copy marvel characters and even shots. The vfx is not bad but its almost same like any superhero movie. Ranbir and alia are okay and not in full form. Music is also copied from other songs of pritam himself. So, public can figure out if they are getting what they were promised or not. Here, definitely I personally ended up in disappointment!",/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,SoumikBanerjee25,5," Was this supposed to be a love story? Mr. Ayan Mukerji, what were you thinking?
","You know this was a mistake, yes, an error of judgment from my end. I traveled almost forty miles to watch the first day first show in 3-D, and I did it because I could not have waited any longer, but now it seems all my efforts have gone in vain! I recklessly put all my faith and trust in Bollywood, and into a director whose portfolio thus far, has nothing but coming of age/contemporary love stories, and this is yet another unwarranted expansion of his catalog.",/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,nishantqazi,1," Too much hype
","When I saw the trailer the first time I was disappointed, as Ranbir Singh looked and felt very cosmetic and very artificial as Shiva.",/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,diprajkate,1," Average film
",I had very high expectations from the movie but the movie failed to reach that expectations the VFX is good but in some scenes it appears like cartoon based VFX.. Ranbir is good but not given his best... supporting cast is good.... sometimes it feels likes the movie is streched unnecessarily the length can be reduced by 20 to 25 minutes.. Alia is good.. typical bollywood dialouges are there the interval is good.. Nagarjuna has played his role beautifully ... Amitabh is also good... Shahrukh's cameo is goosebump moment.. but internally it feels like something is missing... overall not that good movie with huge budget of 400cr..,/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,indiainsido,1," First 20 minutes of the laser show was good
","With no story, the movie is nothing more than a laser and action show. You will definitely enjoy the first 20 minutes but then you can't watch the same VFX for 2 hours. The screenplay is weak, dialogue is cringey. If this movie was divided into small episodes of 30 minutes each for a web show and if there was a good story and acting was good, this should have been really great. Missed opportunity.",/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,pramodh_kumar_g,1," STRICTLY ONE-TIME WATCH FOR FANS
","Firstly try to read the entire review...
After watching the film... My feeling... It was not worthwhile...
It was quite a lag film.. poor graphics despite the budget..(some might like it because of the hype surrounding it or their limited knowledge of CGI)
Huge Inconsistency in the screenplay...
Mainly couldn't able to connect with the plot (most probably cause the script work was not done well)
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY... UNNECESSARY LOVE STORY/TRACK...
Purely Disappointing Film...
If you are a fan of Ranbir, Alia, Amitabh & Sharukh... then it is a strictly one-time watch...
But on a personal note... I would recommend you skip it...",/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,amritanshcityhunter,1," Huge Disappointment
","First part is good , but the 2nd part is way too over dramatize , i think there's way too much vfx , instead of that much of vfx the actor and actress should have focussed more upon their actings , in short huge disappointment if you're going to watch it in theatres .",/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,bhardwajshekhar-53197,1," Boring movie and Money wasted on just VFX
",I don't understand why people don't realise that the story line and acting is way more important than just throwing money at VFX.,/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,rocksahir,1," Poor execution of Good Story
",Below average Movie. VFX work look very poor and spoile the experience. Some places story feels disconnected and leads you to rethink. Concept and story line is good but the selection of cast makes this experience even painful In this film Casting is a major problem. Selection of cast needs to done proper character in the movie and faces feels mis fit as specifically Lead actor feels little too much misfits for the role. Execution of story is also below average and they have wasted such wonderful concept. More research needs to be done. That depth of story was missing. Making the experience even poor in the movie Sound synce is not up to the mark and landed into poor communication. Overall disappointing. A wonderful story executed very poor.,/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,monalpatel,7," A brilliant concept derailed by weak screenplay & 💬
",Astraverse is a brilliant concept but executed very lazily. The over emphasis on love story leave the sour taste in audience's mind. The dialogues are so poor that it makes you why so much incompetence when there is so much money involved in this film. Acting of Alia is uneven. She is very good in some scenes but really cringey in others. This film was shot for years which makes me think that it got every shades of acting from Alia's career.,/review/rw8553324/?ref_=tt_urv
