","Only Kubrick and Spielberg, working together on different time planes, could create such a philosophical and intellectual heartbreaker.
A graceful, yearnful masterwork of connection and evolving artificiality within the tattered seams of the human heart. Reflections, sunrises, and countless other grand images compliment a bittersweet story laced with impenetrable darkness.",/review/rw5566040/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2016,Prismark10,7," Mecha World
","AI is inspired by British science fiction writer, Brian Aldiss short story 'Supertoys Last All Summer Long.' It was a project initiated by Stanley Kubrick and then taken over by Steven Spielberg who directs as well as write the screenplay. It is a mixture of Spielberg's wide eyed childlike wonder from his ET era with Kubrick's cold gaze of adulthood. It is a modern version of Pinocchio.",/review/rw5566040/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2009,tightspotkilo,8," If you don't like this movie, here's a suggestion...
","I won't say people will either love this movie or they will hate it. I'm sure it breaks down that way to some extent, and the range of opinions expressed about the movie support that notion, but I'm nevertheless also sure there are those out there who are ambivalent or indifferent about it, neither loving or hating it. That's because I'm one who was ambivalent about it after I first saw it in 2001. There was much to like about the movie. Film makers par excellence, Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. Does it get any better than that? The cast was good too, all of it. Especially Haley Joel Osment. Production values galore. The film is beautifully rendered. But even with all that there was something about it that bothered me, even annoyed me, and whatever it was it got in the way of my enjoyment of it. So I dismissed this movie and didn't even think about again it for years. Recently it popped up on HBO. I took the opportunity to watch it again. I found myself not being as bothered by the movie as I was before. HBO being HBO, I watched it again. And then again. Now there is nothing about the movie I dislike or that bothers me. I now like this movie without reservation. I also figured out why I reacted the way I did in the initial viewing.",/review/rw5566040/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2001,virek213,10," A.I.--A Film With Heart And Brains
","Steven Spielberg's latest movie A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, which he took up at the encouragement of the late, great Stanley Kubrick, has caused widely divergent comments.  And I can't help wondering if the most scathingly negative reviews of this movie aren't just an open desire to see Spielberg crash, as he had with ""1941"" and HOOK.",/review/rw5566040/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2001,Anonymous_Maxine,10," A.I. is a perfect example of negative criticism born from expectations based on assumption or ignorance.
","That's right, Steven Spielberg is back. He has taken it upon himself to helm the story started years and years ago by the late Stanley Kubrick, and Kubrick's influence is strikingly clear, especially late in the film. A lot of people were put off by A.I., but this is because they expected a cute kids movie, something in the tradition of E.T. I don't know, maybe it's the fact that both movies have initials in the titles that caused this association. Spielberg is no stranger to dark content. I don't think I need to take the time to explain the content of much of Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List or even pars of Jurassic Park. Before I saw A.I., I read that Spielberg described the tone as what you would get if E.T. had been killed and dissected by the scientists, or if he had never recovered from that mysterious disease. This is a surprisingly accurate description of what you get with the film, so be warned! Don't come out disappointed because of false expectations, as I'm sure is the case with soccer moms around the world. ",/review/rw5566040/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2020,rotaruhajime,10," Can't re-watch it again
","I was 13-14 when I watched this movie. It's a long movie if I recall it correctly. I was so moved by it's theme, so I watched it all. I had strong feelings of sadness and sympathy towards little robot David that wanted to be a real child and to have a mom to love him. And that little bear ...
I cried during some scenes. I don't think I cried that much at any movie like at this one. Even though it's a Sci-Fi movie it has a lot of emotions. I have never watched it again since then. It'll be too hard for me
P.S I don't get how some people can rate this incredible movie with an 1 ? like why ?
Of course it's not a perfect movie, but sometimes it doesn't have to be. It matters your feelings about it, because this movie is that deep.

9 June 2016,Tweekums,9," A modern Pinocchio
","In the not too distant future global warming has caused the ice caps to melt flooding coastal cities and necessitating strict rules on the number of children people can have. Human looking robots have taken over many tasks and now a robotics engineer has come up with a new idea; to create a robotic child that will love the person it is imprinted on. The prototype, David, is given to a company employee whose wife Monica can't get over the fact that their child is in a coma. They are warned that once imprinting has taken place it can't be undone; if they decide they no longer want David he will have to be scrapped. All goes well until their son wakes from his coma; he sees David as a rival for his mother's love and it isn't long before an accident happens and they can no longer keep David. Unable to have him scrapped Monica leaves him in a remote location. David, remembering the story of Pinocchio that Monica read to him, he decides that he must find the Blue Fairy from that story so she can make him into a real boy and he can go home. He meets up with Gigolo Joe, a robot on the run, and together they try to find Blue Fairy although it won't be easy; on the way they will have to face people who revel in the destruction of robots and David will have to confront the fact that he is not unique.",/review/rw5566040/?ref_=tt_urv

","First of all, once again I think the critics have got it wrong. Like Blade Runner and 2001, this is a film that will be properly judged in 10/20 years or maybe more. Its way ahead of its time, the combination of Kubrick and Spielberg is unique, its unlikely we will ever see anything like this again.",/review/rw5566040/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2016,dakjets,10," Artificial love
","This film is both touching and disturbing at the same time. However, very gripping and a film that is difficult to ignore. The couple Swinton has a son who is in a coma. They lose eventually hope that the boy may come to consciousness again, and say yes to accept David, the robot which researchers hope can reduce the loss for childless couples. The couple tries to love robot David, but can not provide unconditional love. When the couple son Martin wakes up of a coma, it becomes even more clear: David does not fit in, and he has to go. The mother takes a drastic decision that leads David out on a dangerous journey. He has only one desire: to be a real human a mom can love. ",/review/rw5566040/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2016,Bored_Dragon,10," A classic for all generations
","The story is a futuristic combination of ""Pinocchio"" and ""Wizard of Oz"" that ends in the ambient of ""Day After Tomorrow"". The complete atmosphere of this movie reminded me of a strange mix of ""Clockwork Orange"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", and if I didn't know it was Spielberg's movie I could swear that it was Kubrick. Later I did some digging and found out that the movie originally was indeed Kubrick's. Kubrick was working on this project for 12 years and involved Spielberg later on. Work on it started in 1993, but Kubrick died before it was done and Spielberg took over and finished the job. The mixture of Spielberg and Kubrick elements is obvious in the movie, but it is really tricky to tell which one of them did what part. Obviously Spielberg's ending is actually Kubrick's original idea from the first version, even before Spielberg had anything to do with this project. Ministry was also Kubrick's idea. He was a fan and he personally called them to offer them a part in the movie. The first time he called, the Ministry singer thought it was someone screwing with them and he hung up the phone.",/review/rw5566040/?ref_=tt_urv

","Steven Spielberg's ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: AI is still, after 18 years from its release, considered by some a mixed bag and by some one of Steven Spielberg's lesser movies.

8 December 2001,smitheeallen,10," I liked it
","I thought A.I. was a very good film.  I'm sure it is somewhat different from what Kubrick had thought but he and Spielberg had worked on it for a long time. I liked the questions that it posed about such as what does it mean to be a being?  Does the boy robot have genuine feelings or are they programmed?  But we as people do we have genuine feelings or are they ""programmed"" in our genetic code, by society, and by other factors?  Intriguing questions from an intriguing film. Definitely a thinking persons movie. The acting by Haley Joel Osmet was outstanding and the supporting cast was equally good, too.  The portrayal of the future was somewhat frightening but also extremely fascinating. Especially the ending of the film.  I saw this film with my brother who's first word when the film ended was ""Wow!""  He only expresses that for films he really likes.  Those who like science fiction and those who like films that make them think definitely see this film.  Even if you are not as impressed as I am you will find parts of the film fascinating.",/review/rw5566040/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am a big fan of Spielberg's work and though nowadays he is often criticised for his shamelessly tear-jerking sentimentalism, I've never seen that as a problem. It's just a sign of the times, I guess, people leaning towards dark, disturbing, gritty movies and being way too harsh with emotionally charged ones. I personally feel if a movie like A.I. does not move you to your very last cells, then something is deeply wrong with your human capacities.",/review/rw5566040/?ref_=tt_urv
