8 January 2020,marcintn,9," Perfect 90s PC culture before it morphed into the Insanity we have today.
","I have always loved this movie. It captured a time when ""politically correct"" was becoming a watchword and a culture. Looking back, the protesters look tame and quaint compared to what we have on campuses today. Jeremy Piven is the obvious standout as the leader of The Pit, a decidedly Un-PC group on campus who just wants to have fun in a place where everyone is offended by everything.
Everyone involved is amazing and the film is endlessly quotable. It's not Animal House and it's not trying to be.
After loving it for years, I bought the DVD and listened to the commentary. Director Hart Bochner comes off as a guy who just wanted to make a good film, and I think he succeeded.
Jeremy Piven on the other hand, comes off as an arrogant prima donna who endlessly brings up how, ""If only I'd been allowed to improvise my entire dialogue, this film would have succeeded.""
Given some public statements he's made since then, like John Cusack wouldn't have had a career if it hadn't been for him, my opinion of Piven as a person is low. Despite that, he really does turn in a signature perform in this film.
It doesn't take itself seriously and you should go into it just wanting to be entertained. It's a nostalgic trip for those of us who were teens/twenties in the 90s, like Airheads, SFW, or Singles.",/review/rw0345192/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2005,guyfromjerzee,8," A solid, funny film that deserves to be a cult classic
","I'm really glad this movie was able to find its audience on video, because it deserves recognition. This is a damn good film! The unfortunate thing about a movie like ""PCU"" is that the ""Animal House"" comparisons are inevitable. But there's no point in comparing. ""PCU"" stands on its own two feet. ""Animal House"" is one take on college fraternities and ""PCU"" is another. It's like comparing ""The Naked Gun"" to ""In the Heat of the Night,"" because they're both about cops. The characters and plot in this movie are in no way derivative of ""Animal House."" Jeremy Piven was a great choice for the lead. I've always been a fan of his, but he always gets stuck with supporting roles. In this case, he proves that he has the confidence to carry a lead role. His laid-back sense of humor makes the jokes all-the-more hilarious. I'm often more appreciative of comic actors who don't try to hammer a joke to death with mugging and wacky inflections. Piven delivers a joke the way it's supposed to be delivered--in a straight fashion. We don't see enough of that nowadays. And I can say the same about most of the actors in the film, with maybe the exception of David Spade. He's the type of actor, who can either be sarcastically funny or sarcastically annoying. He doesn't exactly provide the film's funniest moments, but he plays a moderately small role and doesn't get much of a chance to do any annoying shtick.",/review/rw0345192/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2006,clavalon,9," Excellent College Movie
","One of the best attempts at recreating the legendary iconography that is Animal House. This movie is full of quotable quotes and less than known actors at the time. Check it out if only for Jeremy Piven, Jon Favreau and Jake Busey in an amusing cameo as a stoner/ultimate Frisbee player. Favreau and Piven's interaction recalls old comedy schtick but in a very endearing way. The appearance of George Clinton makes the movie worth watching if only for the party scene. And if you didn't already think the soundtrack to hell was going to be Starland Vocal Band here in lies a scene to convince you otherwise. David Spade should not be overlooked in his role as a preppy frat boy wanna-be and his rant about all of the PC sects at the end of the movie is completely priceless. This movie though much overlooked is a cult classic and should be well recognized in the pantheon of college themed flicks.",/review/rw0345192/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2013,The-Sarkologist,8," Let's protest against protesting
","Upon first hearing of this movie my initial thoughts were ""not another sex-romp comedy in the vein of Animal House."" Well, I guess once again I was wrong. My friend said that this movie is very close to what campus life is like in the 1990's. Having sat through numerous 1980's sex romp comedies, such as Revenge of the Nerds and Fraternity Vacation, I was not to keen on seeing it again. Upon seeing this movie I realised that the sex romp comedy has gone out of fashion now and college comedies are not going to be as stereotypical as they previously were.",/review/rw0345192/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2019,dworldeater,8," Classic 90's comedy
","PCU is a hilarious college comedy starring Jeremy Piven. A pretty normal looking preppy dude goes to Port Chester University to decide if he wants to go there and ends up befriending the people who live at ""The Pit"", who are at odds with some of the PC groups on campus and a thorn in the side of the administration. Jeremy Piven is a great and charismatic lead and even if he is pushing 40, he still is going to college. PCU is not too far removed from Animal House or Revenge Of The Nerds, but updated for the 90's. It plays on stereotypes, but in a fun way and is very funny. David Spade appears as well as a swarmy, preppy, frat boy type, pretty much an all around weenie. George Clinton And The Parliament Funkadelic appear to play The Pit and for good tunes. So watch PCU and have a good time, or you can ...""blow me where the pampers is"".",/review/rw0345192/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2019,Nate-48,7," Classic movie that captures the time
","This is a near great movie that perfectly captures a time and place where AIDS was at the forefront of everybody's minds, grunge had revolutionized society overnight, feminism was taking it's place on campuses. Political correctness was growing and segregating campuses. There was a resurgence in pot use and a new love affair with hippie culture. In many ways this film predicted a lot of what would eventually happen to campuses and society 25 years later. It's scary to think it's been 25 years already.
The star of the show is Jeremy Piven. David Spade is also good and this is one of Favreau's earliest roles. There are some great witty lines here. Those of a different generation may not get it though I think a lot of today's younger generation will be able to relate.",/review/rw0345192/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2019,foltzweiser,7," They told the future
","When they made this, it was a parody. All the groups were extremely exaggerated, for comedic effect. Now, in 2019, we know, too late, that it was a warning. And the groups are actually like that, now. Only it's not funny.",/review/rw0345192/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2002,funkyfry,6," Surprisingly funny ""toga"" comedy
","Funny college comedy in the ""Animal House"" vein, with Piven out to save his dorm from being turned over to the young Republican legion led by David Spade.  The film's gimmick has the school's last party dorm constantly under attack by women's libbers, radical black nationalists and vegetarians (who get raw meat dumped on them in the film's opening scenes, sure to weed out anybody who really shouldn't see this movie anyway).  Above average laughs and sincerity for this kind of fare.",/review/rw0345192/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2003,dbogosian,10," Hilarious. Great Characters.

19 May 2010,cslintner,10," One of the funniest college comedy movies ever!
","This movie has so many lines in it that I still love to quote after all these years. Most of them make people who haven't seen it turn their heads. Quotes like ""We're NOT gonna protest!"" or ""Can you blow me where the pampers is?"" (Followed by ""Can you show me where the campus is?"") or ""Gutter is a Tool!"" are really funny when well used around the right people. I laughed throughout this movie. The scenes with Gutter are hilarious!; from the problems getting beer to accidentally bringing back George Clinton to the frat house, to the attempt to people surf during the party at the end. Droz has his moments as well. I think the ""We're not gonna protest"" speech at the end of the movie was the highpoint of the movie. I think this movie deserves a much better overall rating.",/review/rw0345192/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2003,Zoopansick,10," This is college
","I'm sorry, maybe it's because I attend ultra-liberal UC Santa Cruz, but let me tell you I love this movie.  I see people like this on a daily basis, and this movie hits it right on the head.  I think Animal house is better overall, but I gave it a worse score because PCU just clicks with me.  I can relate to it really well, and this is almost 10 years after it's release. The line where the school president is asking about the future of the academics programs is hilarious and is close to being true.  It goes...",/review/rw0345192/?ref_=tt_urv

",This movie is fantastic. If you are the over sensitive type which is typical of most in 2020 you won't like it because your too uptight. If you get what comedy is this is a fun trip. Don't be the over sensitive type.,/review/rw0345192/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2000,Crackphu,10," College Classic. It's funny, it's entertaining, it's social
","For anyone who has attended a liberal arts college in the last 10 years, this film is for you.  While I find it very cool that the Wesleyan College people take credit for the film (in the same way that Dartmouth folk take pride in their own ""Animal House""), I don't think you needed to have attended that school to identify with this one.  The wymynists, the stoners (playing ""disc""), and the overzealous administration trying to rid the campus of any semblance of tradition or spirit are unfortunate but all too common themes on campuses across this country both large and small.  The situations about the social, academic and the extracurricular were all right on.  Very funny movie.",/review/rw0345192/?ref_=tt_urv

","As far as homages to / imitations of ""Animal House"" go, this has to rank as a pretty good one. It's got good characters, some amusing dialogue, decent satire of special interest groups, and a cool soundtrack. Its pacing is acceptable, its running time brief (81 minutes in total), and its spirit irresistible.",/review/rw0345192/?ref_=tt_urv

2 May 2006,kzintichmee,10," a galaxy of past and future stars
","I saw PCU in the theatre and a couple months later got to see the P-Funk All Stars at Lollapalooza, so that was pretty cool. I watch this movie about once a year on my old VHS and it still cracks me up. It had a lot of future and former TV stars in it. Jeremy Piven has done a ton of stuff since then. Megan Ward, (hot,hot,hot) went on to do Dark Skies, that cool alien invasion series on TV. Chris Young had Max Headroom to his credit, one of the coolest shows ever! Alex Desert had the very neat show,The Flash, behind him. I never realized what a science fictiony bunch they were. Just a lot of funny ideas very well done in this film. Pig Man watching TV nonstop for his thesis on the theory that a Michael Caine or Gene Hackman movie can be found anytime. The skateboard guys that aren't any good. The stoners fascinated by a spinning frisbee. Oh yeah, I almost forgot about Jon Favreau, I heard he's supposed to be directing the new Iron Man movie. He played the house metalhead, Gutter. That guy has come a LONG way. David Spade did what he does best, he was a snotty little t--d. Jessica Walter, a hotty in her own right, was the only ""grown-up"" star, as the college president. Sort of an Animal House for the '90's, with political correctness being the central theme. If I remember correctly, I was the only guy in the theatre when I saw this. I'm glad it's finding it's audience on DVD. I'm gonna go out and buy one and while I'm at it, I'll get a Starland Vocal Band CD, too.",/review/rw0345192/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2007,MCL1150,7," It Keeps Calling Me Back
","I must have watched PCU over two dozen times back in the late 90s when Comedy Central was running it to death. Absolutely the kind of film I would NEVER EVER think I'd like, but I watch it every time it's on. I developed a genuine affection for it. Why? I don't know. After all, it's 90% ""Animal House"" ripoff right to the core. The whole slob-house gang versus the useless administration and annoying rival Greek letter outfit. Instead of ""Otis, My Man!"" there's George Clinton and P-Funk. Instead of Otter, there's Droz, instead of John Belushi, there's ""Gutter"" and so on. I know this reads like I'm putting it down, but far from it. Any movie about college that features a student who's senior thesis is watching TV 24/7 just to prove that there's always a Gene Hackman or Michael Caine movie playing is OK with me! Very twisted! I'll never buy the DVD, but I will watch it anytime I happen to catch it on my cable.",/review/rw0345192/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2000,sychonic,," Missed opportunity
","Of anyone worthy of hilarious ridicule, it's those wacky PC types who take themselves painfully seriously about whatever fill in the blank issue they have--meat is murder, save the whales, wimmin or wymen or wymyn or whatever they are. And of course even worse the tradition of the hostile faculty and administration of the modern American University--they need a good kegger to clean out the uptight.",/review/rw0345192/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2001,lonecap-2,10," Some of it's parts
","This film was more than the sum of it's parts.  It included the proto-modern gross out comedy, the college comedy, the P.C. comedy of errors, and the fish out of water.  But still, thanks to smooth transitions, an even script and likable characters, it managed to be funnier, better than most moviegoers could have expected it to be.",/review/rw0345192/?ref_=tt_urv

29 April 2012,Sandcooler,6," Worth it for the 90s feel
","""PCU"" is the typical story of a movie that got slaughtered at the box office, but somehow still found an audience afterwards. It's not difficult to see why it didn't take of right away: it's really sort of a thinking man's college comedy. It utterly refuses to go down the usual gross-out route (it's a great route, but still), but instead tries to be a biting satire. Some of the stuff is pretty good (protesting against protests!), other stuff falls flat but you still appreciate the effort. The actors are sort of a mixed bag, but Jeremy Piven owns the movie with a charismatic performance as the token rebel. I'm assuming Megan Ward was also great, I was distracted by her intense 90s hotness. There aren't that many gags overall, but the brutal style of the thing definitely makes it stand out. ""PCU"" may not be the hidden gem of 90s comedies some have tried to make of it, but I'm happy it's still around.",/review/rw0345192/?ref_=tt_urv

","Jeremy Piven is an extremely charismatic actor and if it wasn't for him, this movie would be a bomb.  However, since he is in it it is an entertaining movie with some flaws.  It has been labeled as a rip-off of Animal House, but I don't see it that way.  PCU pokes fun at all the different minority groups and cause movement who have been opressed the most by the bad, bad white man.  A rating of 8 out of 10 was given.",/review/rw0345192/?ref_=tt_urv
