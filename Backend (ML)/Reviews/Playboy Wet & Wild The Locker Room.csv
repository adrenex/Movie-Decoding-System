15 January 2022,Jblum5,5," Cringeworthy with some wonderful performances
","Sex appeal is the story of an high IQ girl who wants to develop an app that calculates how to have sex to win a contest. The typical ""gender roles"" are switched here- with the female being cold , calculating toward sex and the man being emotional and attached.",/review/rw8115939/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2022,JoBloTheMovieCritic,6," Sex Appeal
","6/10 - the cringe is real (some really bad dialogue and like 3 extended weird sexual ""metaphor"" screens) in this Hulu original film, but between that hilarious classroom scene (quadratic formula and all) and a surprisingly nuanced conclusion, this one managed to win me over.",/review/rw8115939/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2022,bhuerkamp,6," A teen sex-comedy with something to say
","""Sometimes you have to learn to fail to grow.""
""Well, you didn't fail. I mean, that's a B. And your grade won't be compromised with a 105 average.""",/review/rw8115939/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2022,Avidviewer-02847,1," An example of a movie that shouldn't have been made.
","This isn't a memorable rom-com, its just a stupid and forgettable one. First sex as a teenager has been dramatized in far better movies, it's not even funny, it's just dumb. Viewers have to like characters to even care what happens to them. And the obsession with apps, STEM projects I've seen are far more challenging.",/review/rw8115939/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2022,leahcc-41867,4," overall unsatisfying and irritating?
","This movie was a close shot to a relatable romcom for and about teenagers. I assume that it was supposed to be awkward and silly, but a lot of the scenes were just unnecessary and made me ask why they were even included. In many scenes, there's unnecessary dialogue, like Avery telling her whole class that she ""popped her cherry,"" and there was no humor or any reaction from anybody else but her. She's an unrealistic girl who acts just about the same as a robot would, and is incredibly oblivious to the world around her and has the biggest superiority complex I've ever seen. What happened to her long distance boyfriend? Why does Avery interrupt as many classes that Larson is in to either spill out her feeling or just make things awkward? And there's a whole scene where a girl has an orgasm by humping her damn chair. Were they running out of ideas and just needed some filler scenes to elongate the movie? Also, just to put it out there, the synchronized swimming sex scenes? Yikes. This felt like I was watching a sad episode of Family Guy rather than a teen romcom that came out this year.",/review/rw8115939/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2022,ape-08136,7," Worth a watch
",I'm a sucker for a rom com. This 1 is a bit cheesy but in good ways. Follows the templets of so many others but this is a lil unique. Female lead is really pretty and pulls off the pretty brainy girl.,/review/rw8115939/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,PennyIsMine,6," Nothing new here...
","...and sometimes, the things that were, they were cringeworthy, like holding an iPhone like a boom box, ala John Cusack. There were good performances, in particular from the lead actress, but they weren't enough to distinguish this from any other high school love movie.",/review/rw8115939/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2022,kelley1231,7," Entertaining & Lots of laughs
",It's one of those adolescent pop culture films with terrific references to prior films with certain plots that they are discussing at that moment. We laughed a lot & had to rewind to rehear the punchline bc we all laughed too hard. It's cheesy with many predictable moments but worth the watch if you are fans of similar themed films.,/review/rw8115939/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2022,ebhotawisdom-56620,3," Short intriguing with a very poor ending
",I'd rather watch friends with benefits over and over again..hated the ending waited a while to get a good 2022 movie and the first one I get to watch is a rewritten plot that's trash that's just messed up.,/review/rw8115939/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2022,nogodnomasters,5," Solve for ""G""
","Avery Hansen-White (Mika Abdalla) is super intelligent but has never had sex. She creates an app for a contest for sex appeal or something like that. She gets input from everyone, but needs some experience and plans to lose her virginity at the Stemcom convention.",/review/rw8115939/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,MARBLELEMON,7," I like it until the end!
",A teen romance comedy that kind of reminded me of the 'to do list' (which was alot more crude). This film was humorous and fun. I really like when any pleasure sort of scene turned into an adaptation so we can imagine what is happening.,/review/rw8115939/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2022,foothill_warrior,2," Bad ripoff of Polish series ""Sexify""
","Here is a plot summary for Sexify ""To build an innovative sex app and win a tech competition, a sexually inexperienced student and her friends must explore the daunting world of intimacy"" - and even with the dubbed English version it beats this ripoff to pieces. And BTW it has plenty of good - some fairly explicit. Many very funny - sex experiences.",/review/rw8115939/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,xytrgw,8," Surprisingly Realistic
",As someone who just recently exited high school this movie was very surprising relatable to the point I felt attacked.,/review/rw8115939/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2022,kskmah,6," Surprising
","It was an ok movie with good acting, but the ending was surprising. Usually the boy and girl gets together in the end and that was what i waiting for. This is not the case with this movie. That was really surprising. I liked how he rejected her even after she said she loved him. Too little too late. Some unrealistic things though. Why would you ask your friend to do sex things especially knowing that he liked you more than a friend before. You know it's not going end well. She is so smart, but doesn't know love has a lot to do with sex? You shouldn't have sex just to have sex. And I don't know why some review said same old movie? It's not.",/review/rw8115939/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2022,ops-52535,8," wow wow... (a trash worthy review over a tender topic)
","Said the flabbergasted hounddog, not knowing what to say other than that this is a very sexual vocabularized, and tinky winky virginity lost in the svamp called general knowledge, or just how to find the way through the jungle for an ever so innocent, ''dont need to know yet'', teenage girl that hasnt quite had her hormones boiled into the stew called sex yet, so therefore i declare that the age limit for this one should be at least 10 years, because its stunning and hits the balls of fire or the bulls eye over and over again, in a lovely , hilarious way that made me, the ever so dried out cod of a grumpy old man, laugh out loud, and has if possible given me some more fruitful and fantasizing days to live.( the say a good laugh prolonges living)",/review/rw8115939/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2022,momomojojo,2," Better version of telling the story but pity it is too classic still
","Special effects is alright
The camera work is really Hollywood

29 January 2022,davidsask,4," All The Movies With Losing Virginity This Is Fail
",Hey young ones go searching for the classics for what said in headline. The only stupid plot line for today's youth is APPS! Paris Jackson in anything media already junk. The lesbian moms are well know known so nice touch there. There is reason why streamer bought this movie!,/review/rw8115939/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2022,esthermarcosamoo,8," Poor ending but the rest is awesome
","Great movie, if you're giving this bad review you're a man or someone old that doesn't understand teens anymore. This represents how sex for women feels. Not 5 stars because of the poor ending. The guy liked her for years and she confessed to him and he just walk away? It doesn't makes sense.",/review/rw8115939/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2022,ballouvince,1," You can tell DISNEY is ashamed but not that much
","They have different labels for one reason. They want to step over the line and believe you are dumb enough to not know they are DISNEY. Not Hulu. The language is adult. As other reviews said, the big Hollywood trend is to find adults that look like teenagers, so Hollywood directors can be Roman Polanski without being Roman Polanski. Very progressive and trying to say sex isn't about being scientific.",/review/rw8115939/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,mikeferris-11144,10," Funny and Powerful
",Sex Appeal is a funny movie with a powerful life lesson and some great acting performances. It is both a comedy and a romantic drama. Avery is a lot like her idol Mr. Spock. She even knows how to speak Vulcan. She loves science and the normal high school things that involve emotions are no more fun to her than they would be to Mr. Spock. Avery's Spock-like demeanor creates the conflict and drives the storyline along. Will Avery change? What will happen at the STEM-CON? Which guy will she end up with? Will her app really work? What life lesson does she need to learn and will she learn it or remain clueless? This is a powerful movie.,/review/rw8115939/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2022,slees-94711,3," very superficial
",This movie felt really meaningless. I saw the vision but after recently watching and enjoying Sex Education I feel like the vision was very similar but the execution was poor. I see how a 1.5 hr movie might not be able to make their characters as compelling as a three season show but the characters and most of the scenes felt disingenuous. I actually enjoyed the ending though. By this I mean I'm happy the show didn't follow the predictable plot that so many shows do and that is what made me like it. It did seem unsatisfying but I appreciated the change from the status quo.,/review/rw8115939/?ref_=tt_urv
