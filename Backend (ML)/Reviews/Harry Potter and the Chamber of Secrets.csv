16 January 2017,Movie_Muse_Reviews,8," ""The Witch"" is horror for cinephiles, not as much horror genre fans
","There's another version of ""The Witch"" that could've existed. A Puritan family in New England gets terrified by a witch living in the woods, who torments them with supernatural Satanism. If you're saying to yourself, ""wait, isn't that exactly what this movie is?"" then you've come to the right review.",/review/rw3542039/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2020,Hitchcoc,9," Give Me That Old Time Religion!
","This is one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen. It takes place in the time of the Salem Witch Trials. A Calvinist minister, his wife, and five children are forced out of the small town in which they live. They have few practical skills and are at the mercy of the wilderness. Thomasin, the beautiful daughter maintains her sanity through most of the film as the others fall apart. But there is something truly dark at work. Excellent film but not for most viewers.",/review/rw3542039/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2018,Sleepin_Dragon,8," A very good, tense, atmospheric, gothic horror.
","To say I didn't get what I was expecting is a huge understatement, I was expecting a run of the mill horror, with all the usual cliches, obvious and blatant scares, etc, but instead I got to watch ninety minutes of rather subtle, intelligent and subtle horror. The film is hugely atmospheric, moody and tense, it is visually fantastic, with great scenery and costumes. The story unfolds cleverly, when I think of witches, this is what comes to mind, as opposed to the more conventional. As you watch you never quite know what's coming next, or who the malign force truly is. Some truly unsettling and disturbing scenes, it's not a horror in the conventional sense, the scares are not cheap, but very poignant. Very good performance from the cast, Ralph Inseson and Kate Dickie in particular. On occasion the dialogue sounded a little flat, but it was in keeping with the setting of the movie.",/review/rw3542039/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2015,SLUGMagazineFilms,," Gut-Wrenching Tension
","Period pieces don't often serve as the backdrops for horror, which is actually a real shame. Consider The Witch, a story about a banished Puritan family trying to sustain itself on the edge of an ominous forest inhabited by a gruesome witch. The faithful representation of one of the most creepy time periods in American history makes all the difference here. The family's dealings with the supernatural terror in the woods push their spiritual and physical endurance to the breaking point. Robert Eggers pulls no punches and makes no apologies in this film. The Witch's scenes are steeped in primal dread, and each actor makes the audience feel the seams come apart as paranoia and mistrust begin to take their toll. While Game of Thrones alumni Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie offer brilliantly raw performances as the family's mother and father, it's the film's younger actors—Harvey Scrimshaw and Anya Taylor-Joy—who really shine. Scrimshaw captures the nuanced turmoil of being an adolescent male in a strictly religious family. As the oldest daughter who is blamed for the witch's malevolent deeds against the family, Anya Taylor-Joy shows a surprising amount of risk and range in her performance. The film swings for the fences on all fronts. The performances are explosive, the tension is gut-wrenching, and the settings are nightmarish. To the horror films of 2015, the gauntlet has officially been thrown down. –Alex Springer",/review/rw3542039/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2018,BandSAboutMovies,10," Just plain amazing

21 October 2015,punishable-by-death,," As good as psychological horror gets
","I feel like I can't come up with the right words to describe this incredible movie, but I'll try. The lingering atmosphere is done incredibly well from the beginning, helped along by a combination of a tense score and the use of extended periods of silence. The acting is bang-on and you don't know when or how it is going to end. The movie doesn't have 'twists' exactly, but the way it is written keeps you guessing constantly. And I personally loved the ending. Though the potential is there to use a more standard approach, The Witch however opts to go down a more subtle avenue, leading to the true nature of religious persecution that is on full display here. Additionally, elements of the story have been taken from historical documents, adding another layer of grimness. The supernatural elements are obviously up for discussion, but that these tales were written centuries ago somehow adds more to this disturbing film.",/review/rw3542039/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2020,sambucaaaa,6," Reading the reviews, I thought I had watched the wrong movie...
","... because the amount of 10/10 is very confusing to me. The overuse of the term ""Masterpiece"" as well. It is not a bad movie, the hour and a half went by fast, the cinematography is beautiful and the acting is good, but I must say I was expecting more intensity in the characters or in the plot. Not necessarily ""scary"" things or jumpscares, which I hate, but simply more depth. The witch character was intriguing and I wish we had seen more of her. Overall I don't think I'll ever watch this movie again because I don't think there's more to be analyzed, I dont think the cinematography is fantastic enough to rewatch it either, I didn't get attached to the characters... In short, it is a good movie but doesn't quite deliver after seeing all these 10/10 reviews. I do have to say that the last movie I watched was Midsommar, which blew me away, so compared to it this movie is pretty bland.",/review/rw3542039/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2016,brchthethird,10," An unnerving, surreal descent into religious paranoia
","THE WITCH is, in a word, unsettling. Horror films don't normally have an effect on me, much less scare me, but this one was unnerving in a very palpable way. It's about a Puritan family who are banished from their village for an unspecified religious offense, and subsequently move to a location bordering a forest. While there, repeated misfortune and isolation create the perfect storm of religious paranoia over whether one or more of them are possessed by the devil. What THE WITCH masterfully does is to create this tense atmosphere and maintain it over nearly the entire length of the film. Whether it be odd/surreal imagery, slow and deliberate camera-work, or an eerie score reminiscent of Ligeti's ""Atmospheres"" (used in Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY), all of it is used to brilliant effect and should be capable of rattling even the most seasoned viewer, especially if they have a religious background/upbringing (as I did). In fact, I sensed a lot of Kubrick here; not just 2001, but also THE SHINING. Not surprisingly, they share some thematic elements. The performances were also pitch perfect and very believable for the characters the actors played and, although this might prove hard to get by for some, they speak in period-authentic language/accents. Ultimately, the film is rather ambiguous as to whether or not the events occur in the manner you see them, but that's the beauty of it: like religion itself, THE WITCH is open to interpretation. And as such, it establishes itself (in my opinion) as one of the best horror films of the last 10 years.",/review/rw3542039/?ref_=tt_urv

","When you leave the theater in stunned silence, I think the film did its job. The Witch is the next low budget horror film to reach the theaters this year, and it's easily the best. The film rarely ever relies on jump scares to get your head spinning as the core of this film's brilliance lies with its haunting imagery and eerie score. ",/review/rw3542039/?ref_=tt_urv

","Do not believe your eyes or let's not be deceived. Also do not lose your faith. Or maybe you're just a realist and finally see what's really what. What may sound like crazy talk is just me trying to prepare you for this movie. Because this may have been promoted as a horror movie in many countries (and the filmmaker knew this could get him into trouble, but also that distributors like to put things in boxes to promote them), it's more a folk-tale as the full title is suggesting.",/review/rw3542039/?ref_=tt_urv

The Witch engrosses you in the time and place of its setting, it's a family drama, a horror and a folk tale. All interwoven together into a macabre ode of the times when people were frightened of the primeval darkness of the forests and the inexplicable twists of their wretched fates. Intense and gripping from the very beginning. With some of the most amazing acting I've seen by the youngest cast members. Fantastic movie for horror fans and a masterful period piece.
