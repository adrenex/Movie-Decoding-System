14 April 2022,Sleepin_Dragon,8," A fine adaptation.
","I read the book prior to the release of this, and I have to say it isn't a favourite of mine, nor was the awful Marple adaptation some years ago.",/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2022,bosporan,7," Who is Evans?
","Hugh Laurie has done a fabulous job deftly infusing humour into this script. The cinematography is delightful, with gorgeous costumes, lovely architecture and rugged scenery brought to life. A strong cadre of actors with the wonderful character of Frankie (Lucy Boynton) pulling all the strings, Boynton is in her element with this persona.",/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2022,gridoon2023,7," Watchable but fatally overlong; Lucy Boynton by far the best thing in it
","This Agatha Christie story has a gripping, instant hook but a rather underwhelming resolution; by the time you finally learn who Evans is and why they didn't ask him, you may wish that you never wondered in the first place. Hugh Laurie aka Dr. House, who writes, directs and plays a supporting role, does not bring very much new to the table, apart from a flourish here and a photographic trick there, and Will Poulter is merely OK as Bobby Jones. But Lucy Boynton is magnetic as Frankie: beautiful, playful, witty (especially in the first of the three episodes), she really brings the character to life. On the basis of this performance, she totally deserves a regular spot in a possible future Agatha Christie series - one that, hopefully, will resolve its cases in fewer than 175 minutes. *** out of 4.",/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2022,bowieec,9," I loved it
","Compared to the initial reviews, it appears I'm in the minority. I thoroughly enjoyed the three episodes and binged them in one night. I found the whole thing fun, charming and a hoot. I loved all the performances as well as the lush locales and cinematography and the performances. Hugh Laurie's direction is smooth. Not everything adds up, but this isn't Agatha Christie's best story, and that's okay overall. There are always too many suspects and shoehorning for things to make sense in the plot. As long as you understand who did it and the basic why in the end, you're good. Just go along for the ride. Pay attention to the clues as they come and you can probably solve it before they do. Sure, there are tons of red herrings and subplots to nowhere that distract, but again, it's lesser Agatha Christie. What do people expect? It's only confusing if you let it overwhelm you. And it needn't. Enjoy!",/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2022,bjarias,8," ... simply-enjoyably-entertaining
","... with the look of someone could be ten years older & possibly even that much younger, Lucy Boynton really helps make thus short miniseries what it is... truly capturing the period, all actors fit in exceptionally well to the storyline... would it be turned into a running series it could easily go on for several years... anyway, now we've at least got three enjoyable episodes.",/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2022,nije-mala,8," Delightfully Entertaining
","What a delightful piece of television entertainment! Tip-of-the-hat to Mr. Laurie for this witty, at times silly (but in a good way) and suspenseful storytelling packed in the technically nicely executed and well acted three part series.",/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2022,luckyribka,9," I loved it!
","I salute you, Hugh Laurie.",/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2022,cherold,8," Solid Christie adaptation made so much better by Boynton
","This mystery kicks off when an earnest young man hears the dying words of someone who has fallen - or been pushed - off a cliff. Mysteries abound, corpses pile up. The earnest young man has a friend named Frankie, who is mercurial and flirtatious and they kind of like each other but won't quite say it. And it becomes clear that only these amateur sleuths can solve things.",/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2022,tmichaelny@aol.com,8," Thoroughly enjoyed it!
","This felt like an Agatha Christie story. It kept to the original story as I remember. This production was clever, witty and stylish. It wasn't dark and broody as is the current fashion....and spoiler alert...it has a happy ending! This was infinitely better than the one that part of the ""Marple"" series! I highly recommend this one for a pleasant, old fashioned Murder mystery.",/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2022,Ziggy1965,6," It started off really good and had great hopes for it ...
","... but by the 3rd episode it too fast, too confusing, just too convenient and silly and stupid.",/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2022,rory-56048,10," A delightful caper
","I don't understand the complaints here. I found this one of the most satisfying Christie adaptations. In fact I watched it twice, more or less back to back. There's a lightness of touch and a wry amusement that I find refreshing compared to the older versions, which take themselves, and the story, so seriously. This is just a delightful caper.",/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2022,swalker-17305,10," As Good an Adaptation of Book Ever
","First, in response to those who find film slow. All British mysteries are slow. All British mysteries cram 2 hours of story into 6 hours of broadcast.",/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2022,grahamstreek,7," Wonderful script. Enthralling drama.
","I was wary of watching this version of Agatha Christie's story after recent dreadful Sarah Phelps' penned dramatisations. Fortunately this screenplay was written by Hugh Laurie and he did a tremendous job. There is not a wasted line, every word, while not essential to the plot, adds humour and colour, and brings the characters to life. The drama is beautifully shot, and the character acting is top drawer.",/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2022,william-egan,10," Extremely enjoyable!
","The people who gave this low marks all seem to be nitpicking,or else gave up after the first ten minutes. I thought this was great, and will cheerfully rewatch it in the future.",/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2022,Laight,3," The book didn't work, neither does this effort
","Why Didn't They Ask Evans has always been considered one of Agatha Christie's lesser works, and for good reason: the plotting is poor, the characters aren't strong, and the detective work is sloppy at best. Unfortunately this well intentioned effort suffers from the same issues. The first episode is fun, but then nothing much happens except the introduction of a lot of characters that lead to little mystery or suspense. The acting, however, is quite good, and Lucy Boynton is terrific. But Will Poulter is miscast as the romantic hero: his goofy and sweet demeanor are wrong for the part (although, in all fairness, the dialog he's forced to spout might sink anyone playing this role). All in all, the three stars are for the costumes, sets, and effort everyone puts into this. But, like the book it's based on, it doesn't work.",/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2022,GiraffeDoor,6," You know what you're getting.
",Fairly standard adaptation of Britain's most over-adapted novelist.,/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2022,aebenson-81453,8," Very enjoyable adaptation close to the book
","I have always loved Why Didn't They Ask Evans and I loved that this adaptation stuck more closely to the book. Yes, there were some changes but the heart was there.",/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2022,bangel3322,5," Lost opportunity here....
","I've not read the book, and so I don't know how the book ends, and I cannot compare. I have however seen the 2009 Marple version of this, and I must say I much prefer the ending of that one. The 2022 version has the length advantage, in order to build up more of story, yet still failed to do so, and has less characters than the 2009 version and so there isn't much of a suspect list. The acting in this version is better, but it's still lacking a bit of depth and substance. They should have redone the 2009 as a mini series....it's just a better storyline. This one was a little disjointed.",/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2022,allisonjoys,9," Simply enjoyable
",I'm American. I've never read this book but I love murder mysteries. I don't like when they introduce too many characters just to throw you off from the obvious villain. This was not the case here. All of the characters had a purpose and we were left in the dark just enough so as not to waste time trying to guess. The two leads took us on a fun and twisty ride.,/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2022,gcotrell-801-281822,10," Bravo, Hugh!
","A Christie that hasn't been done to death--and no rampant CGI! Your young romantic leads are lovely, your script's grand, and Mr. Angel is particularly creepy. That's a lovely combo, you and Britbox. Let's hope this is the beginning of yet-another beautiful relationship. Thanks, laddie!",/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2022,jlitty-50057,10," Unexpected find!
","Casually browsing one Tuesday night, I happened upon gem. I was done by Wednesday. I love a good murder mystery and this one had the added bonus of being fun and witty. I loved all the characters but thought the actress that played Frankie was fantastic. I wish there were more episodes. What to do now...",/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv

17 April 2022,scottssherwood-45213,10," enjoy it all...
",Well done Mr Laurie for including some brilliant one-liners. Doesn't play with the plot too much. Just sit back and enjoy a classic Agatha Christie. Great to see the top roles not being hogged by the top stars but some brilliant up and comers. Cheers to all!,/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2022,wonder_cat,9," Well done!
","I started this late last night, thinking it would be good for a distraction and found myself yanked in. Casting is brilliant, the direction is quite fine -Laurie handles the task quite capably with what is usually light hand - and I was eager to wrap it up this Saturday morning and luxuriate as the story unwound. This isn't a fussy whodunit and I loved it.",/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2022,kameonq,7," Fun puzzle of a mystery!
","I really enjoyed this mini-series and have a new appreciation of Will Poulter's acting skills. I am used to him playing a goofball, but he was brilliant as a serious main character.",/review/rw8537509/?ref_=tt_urv
