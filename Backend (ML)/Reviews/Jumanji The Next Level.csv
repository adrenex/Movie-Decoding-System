18 September 2016,BA_Harrison,9," First class all the way.
","Train To Busan can be summed up in four words: zombies on a train. But what director Sang-ho Yeon does with this simple premise is extremely impressive, giving the somewhat tired zombie genre another jolt of life.",/review/rw3516092/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2020,ThomDerd,9," Unforgettable experience! One of the best zombie films ever made.

5 September 2016,3xHCCH,10," More Than Just a Zombie Film
","This new Korean film ""Train to Busan"" is certainly earning a lot of positive word of mouth and box office success since its debut in the Midnight Screenings section of this year's Cannes Film Festival.",/review/rw3516092/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2016,Troy_Campbell,8," Adds a lot of spark to the zombie genre.
","This lively South Korean zombie flick arrives in Oz with a limited release, which is a pity as it's a riotous adventure filled to the brim with action, gore and damn interesting story beats. Like all good films within this subgenre, the narrative is rife with metaphors about modern day issues (parent-child connections, corporate greed, human interaction, etc) but it also provides a compelling survival plot when taken at face value. The core relationship between Yoo Gong's self-centred businessman and his quiet, emotionally-neglected 9-year-old daughter (Soo-an Kim – a tour de force) is riveting as it gets put through the wringer, never feeling anything less than authentic. There are spurts of melodrama, however, that induce the odd unintentional chuckle, whilst a select few from the supporting cast play up their stereotypes – love-struck school girl, despicable scaremonger, muttering homeless man – a little too much. Sang-ho Yeon directs with unabashed gusto, pumping up tension and thrills though a string of adrenaline-pumping set pieces, an amazing train-station sequence that turns from hopeful to deadly being a particular high point. The undead are suitably grotesque and enjoyably expendable, their physical movements a mix between the 28 Days Later mode of rapid flesh-eaters and the herky-jerky twitches of J-horror ghosts, although the rules for how quickly someone becomes ""infected"" seems to vary depending on plot requirement. It doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the zombie genre, but with a bunch of exhilarating set pieces and a willingness to kill off anyone at anytime, Train to Busan certainly adds a whole lot of spark.",/review/rw3516092/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2016,ctowyi,8," Board this train!
","This is one fantastic train ride. I love the creative ideas and the economical character setups. No need for too much heavy top-down moralization. This is a straight-up disaster flick with zombies coming in swarms from all directions. So we already know the archetypal characters - the coward, the brave one, the pregnant one, the youth in love, the heroic one and so on. The fun is in seeing which one will die first and who will live. This train is loaded with some colorful characters. ",/review/rw3516092/?ref_=tt_urv

","The investment manager Seok Woo (Yoo Gong) is a divorced man that lives in Seoul, with his daughter a Soo-an (Soo-an Kim) and his mother. Seok Woo is a selfish man and neglects Soo-an that misses her mother that lives in Busan.

During the journey, the woman attacks a train staff and soon all the passenger in the wagon are attacked turning into zombies.

","No genre has suffered from volume overload as the zombie genre. Zombie television shows, zombie movies both theatrical and straight to video, city zombie walks.zombies are everywhere. Because of the glut of flesh eating walking dead, no genre has suffered so much with overkill. Zombies themselves are not particularly interesting beasts. They don't have any character. They just run (or slow walk) bite and run (or slow walk) again. You won't find many reviews on the thousands of zombie films that will go into detail about the complex layers of the zombie's inner mind.",/review/rw3516092/?ref_=tt_urv

","The best zombie film I have ever seen (outside of the comedy Shaun of the Dead). Such a great film. It starts exactly like a train ride gathering momentum and gaining speed. The only difference with this train ride is I didn't want it to stop. It has a brilliant script, fantastic effects plus a very good choice of cast and acting. It also has a 'credible' plot (as credible as you can get with the zombie genre). Many of the scenes will stay with me for a long time. I hear that Hollywood want to do a remake of it. It will be interesting if it will be done as well as this. I thoroughly recommend this very refreshing and fast paced film. Get a ticket and enjoy the ride!",/review/rw3516092/?ref_=tt_urv

","I never cared about Z related movies or hyped tv shows in this kind of genre. Nevertheless, train to Busan got me. Not cause of the Z topic itself but its ability to paint a gruesome and apocalyptical picture. Esp in our current global situation it raised interesting questions about human values and believes. The cluster of Z's trying - under all circumstances - to hijack the railway engine might stick w me for a while.

3 September 2016,stmovies,9," Highly Entertaining - Climax after climax, not a single minute is wasted.
","If I have not watched the trailer, I will give it a score of 10 for its entertainment value but having seen the trailer, a little is lost. I don't remember having watched any movie that is so damn engaging, so easy to follow, and so exciting right from the first few minutes all the way to the end. All the exciting moments end with a climax that's fit for a movie. The few minutes during each break for audience to catch their breath is not boring or wasted, perfectly used for characters development. I don't understand why someone commented the last 30 minutes is not as good. I find each climax better in the next. If they make a sequel to show some happenings elsewhere with the same plot and concept, I will still watch it.",/review/rw3516092/?ref_=tt_urv

26 August 2018,perica-43151,9," Powerful zombie movie with a heart
","South Korean cinema is so good. This movie is part 28 days later, part Snowpiercer and another part is The Cassandra crossing. But it still manages to be very original. The morality tale is strong, and we see a transformation of corporate self centered father into a self sacrificing hero. The movie disproves his early maxim that everyone should look for themselves in no uncertain terms. The selfish coward corporate train manager and his refusal to help others is given its due. And in the end, humanity wins in the perfect if hopeful ending. Movie is fun, fresh and still manages to be a good zombie/outbreak movie showing end of the world of sorts, in a way much higher budget Hollywood crapies can only dream to achieve. Kudos, South Korea!",/review/rw3516092/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2017,Leofwine_draca,8," Zombie horror masterwork from Korea
","South Korea has made plenty of horror films over the last couple of decades, but very few of them have been zombie films; the country typically favours ghost or psycho tales like WHISPERING CORRIDORS or I SAW THE DEVIL. That changes with TRAIN TO BUSAN, a Hollywood-feel film that owes more than a debt of inspiration to WORLD WAR Z in its depiction of fast, feral zombies that amass into a CGI-animated crowd on occasion.",/review/rw3516092/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2021,stimpy_tr,7," Korean touch to zombie genre...
","Train to Busan is an interesting zombie movie from a Korean director with completely a different approach. Unlike ""the Dead"" series of George Romero or ""Return of the Living Dead"" series, which are the two major series in the genre, this one does not involve comedy and in addition, the suspense is maintained all the time without digressions. The story is as simple as it can be, that is, a zombie assault breaks out in Korea and spreads quickly to cities and to a train traveling from Seoul to Busan. It has some emotional content and also some twists through the ending. The movie also has a realistic sense as to how people can be cruel against each other under high oppression.",/review/rw3516092/?ref_=tt_urv

23 July 2016,kanyeezy-28832,7," Challenge of Korean blockbuster, and it succeeded quite well
","Making zombie blockbuster movies outside of Hollywood is not an easy task. Money is the biggest problem, of course. Since it takes a lot of money, success should be guaranteed before making a movie is decided. However, because there are no other precedents, you can't tell whether it's going to succeed or not. This bad cycle kept Korean directors from making zombie blockbusters. This tells how bold movement it was to make 'Train to Busan'. This movie was destined to be 'hit' or 'flop' and it turns out to be 'hit'. Then, this gives a food for thought. What made this Korean zombie blockbuster movie which is definitely unfamiliar to Korean people successful? Ironically, the secret lies in familiarity. Let's take a look at this movie. Yes, it has zombies, but is this movie all about them? No. Unlike 28 days later or resident evil, this movie actually doesn't care about zombies that much. Zombies are not explained much. Their origin, their ability, cure for zombiesThese are the things that are not being handled well in the movie. In this movie, zombies are just tools to represent 'threats'. The main theme of this movie is about how people react to threats. Selfishness, altruism, violence, love and much more are being depicted in this movie. And Korean people are quite accustomed to these elements. When directors mix these elements well, then the movie becomes a hit, just like this one. However, this movie still has some downsides too. Acting of Jin-hee is quite unbearably bad and the character Yong-suk (who keeps trying to sacrifice others to save himself) had gone way too far. Yes, I can get mad at bad guys but I don't want to get annoyed at them. Also, getting annoyed gets worse when it is not properly resolved as this movie does. Overall, this is a quite well-made movie, though it still has some bad moments. I believe this movie will be a new beginning for Korean blockbusters. And I recommend you to watch this movie to stay alert for rise of Korean movies.",/review/rw3516092/?ref_=tt_urv
