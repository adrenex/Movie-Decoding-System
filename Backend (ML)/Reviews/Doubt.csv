7 March 2021,ThomDerd,6," Good intentions but rushed and sloppy writing.
","Crisis is one of these films with multiple storylines and characters that at a certain point will all meet. The topic itself has a good intention; addiction to oxy and fen is not something to be taken lightly. So kudos for trying to show a big part of the problem and its branching repercussions. But the writing could have been so much better adding more depth into the characters' stories, delving into addiction and also could have given us a much more concise and gratifying ending. Some more realism would be good, especially on the conversations of Armie and the Armenians; that part was not convincing and looked very sloppy.
There are many things that could have been better here, but if you want to see this film with a not-so-critical-eye, maybe you will be interested. It is not a boring film and will keep you invested for most of the time. 5,9/10",/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2021,gustheaffen,7," Nice expose on the corruption of big pharma
","Got news for everyone, this is exactly what happens. Big Pharma buys studies via funding universities and the members in the FDA and CDC move from executive positions in Big Pharma, Ag companies in and out of the FDA and the FDA approves things based on money for Big Pharma, Ag. They lay it out in a movie and people defend them saying don't attack Big Pharma. These are corrupt companies that laughed about the people dying of opioids and all the other toxic crap they make. Good story. I enjoyed it.",/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2021,TxMike,," Raises the awareness of the opioid drug crisis.
","As a comment in the end credits states, more people die from opioid abuse every two years than all those who died in the Vietnam war.",/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2021,jhall_moviereviews,7," Not bad at all
",If you liked the movie crash or traffic you'll definitely like this movie. It's filmed very well with good acting and with a great cast. It's worth the 2 hour watch time I highly recommend it. Probably one of the better movies so far in 2021.,/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2021,namstonk,7," Worth a watch
","Well made, good pace and a decent watch. The casting is somewhat odd, not that the acting is bad it's just that different actor's would have fulfilled the characters better. Is there anything new? Well no, it has been done before but it is a good movie and passed the time nicely.",/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2021,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," Not as bad as all the low ratings, and...
","...certainly not as good at the shill high reviews. The casting was great with decent performances, especially Oldman and Lilly who shined, and the (based on true events) story is certainly not your typical fare. I'm glad it wasn't ""Hollywood-ish"".",/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2021,alon-dar1,8," Did not expect it to be so good
","Very good, good acting, good story telling, good story. I adore serious films that actually make one realize the seriousness of the story, and this is one of those. Well worth watching - for people not looking for cheap action.",/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2021,ferguson-6,5," wiki version
","Greetings again from the darkness. The best thrillers often interweave multiple story lines to create a complex web of detail for viewers to unwind. Writer-director Nicholas Jarecki (ARBITRAGE, 2012) serves up three story lines, all related to the current Opioid crisis. Although the film looks great and has a deep cast, we've seen most of this before and no new insight is provided in regards to the struggle. Instead, it's really standard thriller fare that never goes deep enough into any of the characters to make us care.",/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2021,carldenton,8," Why the negatives
",Don't be fooled by the negative reviews. It is an easy watch and thought provoking. I've seen better and I seen a lot worse.,/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2021,jewelch,10," Well worth watching
","I thought this was very good, I will say in todays society it would be hard to find anyone to stand for what they really believe especially when there is $780,000,000.00 at stake. Yes I recommend it James Welch Henderson, Arkansas 3/11/2021",/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2021,DelveSifter,8," Excellent !
","This movie just pull's you in, I thought that any movie telling 4 different stories would make it confusing but it was just the opposite the stories flowed perfectly into each other and each story is excellent, enjoy",/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2021,lavatch,8," Three Interconnected Lives
","""Crisis"" unfolded the behind-the-scenes process of releasing opioids into the population from three contrasting perspectives. A beleaguered FBI agent is infiltrating a drug distribution ring. A university researcher faces a moral dilemma about his case study of a new painkiller. And a loving mother, a former addict herself, loses her son, who is caught up in drug world due to circumstances beyond his control.",/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2021,Draysan-Jennings,6," Good but...
","A few things didn't add up. One of the things that bothered me was the drug raid towards the end. Instead of the undercover agent wearing a wire, they send in another agent to stand right outside and do sound surveillance. He accidentally trips making a noise and blows the whole bust. The main drug trafficker (mother) had his henchmen all around the abandoned factory. Knowing that why risk everything by sending an agent to do sound surveillance literally feet away from the buy. This was a huge operation, I feel that was extremely careless and wouldn't happen in real life. The second thing that didn't make sense was how easily Mother was found. If a private investigator could find him why couldn't the DEA? And why didn't Mother have more back up when he arrived to his plane? None of this added up. Either way, I still feel this movie was well done and worth checking out. 6 stars.",/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2021,Movie_Reviews,5," Mixed bag
","A whole bunch of household names doing quite an uninspired job. Thrown in with a mix of faces I have never seen before, some not doing too well. The list of ""executive producers"" and ""assistants to executive producers"" in the end credits where the longest I have ever seen.",/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2021,paul-allaer,5," Byzantine plot fells the movie
","As ""Crisis"" (2021 release; 118 min.) opens, we are reminded the film is ""Inspired by True Events"". We find ourselves at the ""US/Canada Border, 40 Miles South of Montreal"", where a dope smuggler is trying to reach the US border, but he is intercepted by Canadian police. We shift to ""Detroit, Michigan"", where we get to know several DEA guys, speculating on how the Canadian police became aware of the smuggler. In a separate story line, we get to know Claire at an NA meeting, She has a 16 yr.old son. In yet another story line, we are introduced to the Big Pharma makers of Klaralon, a new pain killer that supoosedly is entirely non-addictive. At this point we are 10 min. into the film, but to tell you more of the plot would not only spoil your viewing experience, but frankly it'd be pretty much impossible to do...",/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2021,AfricanBro,6," Worth a try
","Not the best film you'll find but it's pretty far from the worst. It follows multiple stories at the same time that will at some point cross over, which made me a little dubious at first but they pulled it off alright. The cast and the acting is great. Just think it needed a little more of something to keep you at the edge of your seat, that's what thrillers are meant for at the end of the day, isn't it?",/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv

9 March 2021,tocanepauli,8," This is a good movie!
","Really enjoyed this. It is a good, thoughtful watch. Yes there are some foibles, but it doesn't detract from the overall story/ies. I think it is very poignant now, especially with all the new Covid vaccines rushing to market and you really have to ask yourself........ Anyway, a very good movie!",/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2021,burlesonjesse5,8," VIEWS ON FILM review of Crisis
",2021's Crisis is my latest write-up. Loved the movie but didn't quite dig the title. Sorry but it's kinda generic.,/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2021,nogodnomasters,6," The Armenians can be trusted
","This is a story about the opioid drug crisis told in three subplots of which only two come together. The DEA is working with Armenians to transfer opioids into the United States from Canada. They are also paying people to buy them from doctors prescribing them as a sting operation that failed to connect to the main plot. Neither one makes sense, but it is what our government does. The DEA agent has an addicted sister. A boy named Dave dies and his mother wants answers. These stories will connect. The unconnected story is Gary Oldman playing a good guy. He is a professor that tests opioids before they go to market. When all of his lab mice turn up dead, he creates issues.",/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv

13 September 2021,eddie_baggins,4," A poor man's Traffic
","In what's only his second feature length film as a director following on from the little seen but well-received 2012 Richard Gere starring Arbitrage, Nicholas Jarecki tackles a weighty and topical multi-strand exploration of the opioid pandemic that is running rampant throughout America and the world but despite a capable cast and potential to craft a tension riddled thriller with a message, Crisis suffers its own titular problem as it fails to find an identity for itself or craft sufficient suspense too keep us engaged.",/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2021,zkonedog,8," Acting Carries The Load In Surprisingly Solid Effort
","The way that ""Crisis"" is constructed, it probably shouldn't be as high as 8/10 stars in my rankings. It utilizes the somewhat tired ""seemingly unrelated plot lines that finally converge at the end trope"" and is fairly melodramatic in all of them. Fortunately, the acting in each scenario is strong enough to carry the film to more-than-solid status.",/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2021,kenzibit,7," Beautifully Made.
","A major and current problem in our society, this movie captures what goes on and processes a drug takes to leave the lab and into the world. I had lots of relations to the lab parts in this movie since I work in a lab and have witnessed stuff like these.... When your research prevents a company from releasing a drug for life savings and profit. Movie was simply made, dialogues were natural and true with no gimmicks in any part. I recommend this movie.",/review/rw6689192/?ref_=tt_urv
