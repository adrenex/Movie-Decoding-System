11 March 2018,gogoschka-1,," REVISITING PROMETHEUS
","It appears many film fans - particularly fans of the ALIEN franchise - dislike PROMETHEUS with a passion, and some of the criticism the film gets is certainly justified. My own issues with PROMETHEUS are mostly script related; several characters seem surprisingly bland or underwritten, which could be due to the many rewrites the script went through, or because some scenes and dialogue that would have been important for the audience to understand the characters' motivations were cut from the final film for time. So PROMETHEUS undoubtedly has its share of problems, but I'm not interested in listing those; there are already whole blogs and even websites dedicated to PROMETHEUS' flaws. Instead, I would like to try to make a case for the things the film does well, because I believe there are some really nice ideas and concepts in PROMETHEUS that deserve to be appreciated. Once you disregard the science aspects (which are presented in such an annoyingly over-simplified way that they appear laughable), and instead approach PROMETHEUS as a sci-fi/mystery/monster movie - which, by the way, is how I view all ALIEN films - with some smarter than average twists, it delivers. Now before you start yelling at me, please hear me out. ",/review/rw2619383/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2012,BJBatimdb,1," Where no idiot has gone before
","Prometheus is the story of a trillion-dollar mission to discover the origins of human life on a distant planet. Basically, this is supposed to be the greatest exploration undertaken in the history of mankind.",/review/rw2619383/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2012,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,7," Prometheus (2012)
","Prometheus seems to have disappointed many viewers. Luckily for me I had no expectations, despite being a Scott film set in the same universe as the Alien franchise. The ship Prometheus goes looking for the beginning of mankind and what created us. It's a rather ambitious idea and the film should be given credit for trying to have some kind of theological and scientific debate. Unfortunately, the script also feels as though it has to give us the scares and frights that we associate with the Alien films. The majority of the film is intriguing but for every positive there is a negative. We get fascinating characters such as David, Vickers, and Janek. But they are mostly pushed aside to focus on the stupid scientist characters. Did the writers not realise how bad their work was? Rapace refuses to let one character take weapons on an expedition because it is a ""scientific"" mission. I call BS on that. No scientist would be so stupid as to explore a new planet, with no information on said planet, without a bit of protection. Characters decide to do stupid stuff, such as approach viscous looking new species etc. and it is here where the film annoyed me. The set design was beautiful, and I enjoyed the quieter moments the film had to offer, such as David's trying to understand emotions etc. The most interesting ideas the film has are delivered in single lines of dialogue, but are never explored. It's head and shoulders above many science fiction films of late, but it also needs a few sequels to clear things up. Unfortunately, that means it wasn't so great as a stand alone film.",/review/rw2619383/?ref_=tt_urv

3 June 2012,yogsottoth,1," You too, Ridley?
","SUCKED BIG TIME! The story was all over the place, most of the characters were completely unnecessary and underdeveloped, and there were no creatures to talk about really. I wasn't even tensed up for a second, let alone being scared.",/review/rw2619383/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2021,tarekali-19909,9," eminently rewatchable film that provides new layers of meaning with each repeat visit
","Prometheus is an eminently rewatchable film that provides new layers of meaning with each repeat visit. How often does a master filmmaker get to revisit their original oeuvre and recreate an even bigger world around and about it? The myth of the engineers and their world changing experimentation is absolutely romantic, compelling and terrifying at the same time. It hurts even more to see how badly utilized this new mythos was in the follow up Covenant. The true mark of success that Ridley Scott achieved was igniting years of debate around the origin and nature of the engineers and their creations. Deep connections to established historical finds on earth make this origin story even more personal - the myth of alien astronauts, benevolent or cruel giants from the stars with incredible, magical technology - creators and destroyers of worlds.
Getting back to the film itself - such gorgeous cinematography and production values. I recently rewatched in 4k format and developed a greater appreciation for small clues hitherto unseen - for example navigation hologram destinations in a reactivated ship of mass destruction.
David is himself a conundrum and a polarizing figure. Was his programming to blame, or the algorithmic output of his treatment at the hand of cruel masters. The android is a central theme in the alien mythos, an expression of creation and self awareness.
The only criticism I have of Prometheus and the sequel Covenant is the proliferation of human stupidity. Predecessor films did not showcase human hubris and blundering to such a great extent - protagonists always took calculated risks. If anything the buffoonery of crews almost seems to justify their fate and reduces sympathy accordingly.
Ridley Scott may still have time to catapult his mythos to legendarium, if his subsequent sequels after Covenant retain purity of spirit with his expanded universe. I for one look forward to seeing more of this wondrous unravelling and exposition.",/review/rw2619383/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2018,nogodnomasters,6," Plot Spoiler review. I tell you why....I think.
","The writers intended this to be an ""Alien"" prequel by incorporating ""Chariots of Gods"" into the film, although some might question the timeline. They concentrated on creating a special effects film, putting science facts on the back burner. It's basically 60's science fiction with great special effects.",/review/rw2619383/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2012,Rob_Taylor,7," It's official....scientists of the future are stupid!

21 October 2012,Marta,1," I don't have the words for how bad this is...
","Yet I'm going to try. The script was a complete mess; I would think Ridley Scott would have been embarrassed to release a film with so many plot holes. Who writes major scripts like this and worse, who would green-light such a disjointed piece of garbage? I literally felt like every other scene had been removed or thrown out, because of the way the story jumped ahead with no coherence.",/review/rw2619383/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2012,Scrooge-3,4," It's like they deliberately screwed up the science

10 June 2017,TheLittleSongbird,6," Not in the same league as 'Alien' and 'Aliens', while heavily flawed it was still better than expected
","'Alien' is still to this day a tense, shocking suspenseful and frightening masterpiece, one of my favourites of the genre. The bigger and bolder 'Aliens' is one of those rare sequels that is every bit as good as its predecessor. Both are two of my favourite films and the character of Ripley is one of the most iconic female characters in film.",/review/rw2619383/?ref_=tt_urv

I feel I have to respond the deluge of haters on IMDb for this film, and no, I'm not trolling, I genuinely LOVED this film – and find no fault with it whatsoever! I can't believe such negative opinion and vitriol for this film! I've read and re-read the same criticisms over and over again, and for me they don't hold water.",/review/rw2619383/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2012,harryplinkett14,1," Bad film
","The irony is that while 'Alien' was a film with a modest budget that desperately tried to use the available resources to pull off the look of an A-film, 'Prometheus' is a film with a monstrous budget that doesn't even seem to aspire to rise above the B-movie level - with the exception of special effects.",/review/rw2619383/?ref_=tt_urv

11 June 2012,onepotato2,1," Incompetent as both story-telling and film-making
","Alien was a game changer when it came out. The reason you would want the director of that movie to resume after 30 years, is that he would being his extremely high standards to what has become a pretty bad franchise. Aggravatingly, all we see on every front (score, narrative, structure, imagination) is the lowest of low standards. Prometheus is not a game-changer. It's even worse than the lesser Alien movies, which makes it something like ""Attack of the Laser Squids from Planet Terror!!!""",/review/rw2619383/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2012,billygoat1071,8," An Intriguing Incomplete Story
","Prometheus was meant to be another great Sci-Fi film by Ridley Scott, but this one is trying to be grander than Alien. It does succeed to be grand, but it doesn't reach its greatness. There is a good concept in this film. Everything looks beautiful and the world is quite fascinating. But it stumbles when we go to the script, storyline, and the characters. It's still worth watching and quite intriguing, but I don't think it will be as classic as his other Sci-Fi film.",/review/rw2619383/?ref_=tt_urv

17 June 2012,wordclock,," Not what I was hoping for
","It's good to see that Ridley Scott still has the same vision for stylistic sets and atmospheric lighting.Lots of dripping water and eery shadows as one might expect from the old master. The special effects are impressive, the CGI is great, the technology is plausible for the turn of the next century. But - and I'm afraid it's a big but - the plot is disjointed, the characters two dimensional and the script is, well, not the best. Far too many things happen which simply make no sense at all, or just don't tally with ""what we know already"" about the Alien universe. Far too many plot mechanisms, bits of tech and even shots and scenes are borrowed from other films - Serenity, independence day, The Mummy, Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull, Pitch Black, X- Files. I won't go into detail because I can't do that without using spoilers, but try it yourself. Watch the film and see how many ripped off bits you can spot. Spectacular, yes. A great film? No. sadly not.",/review/rw2619383/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2012,Leofwine_draca,6," Not bad, but surprisingly superficial
","Who would have thought that, after all the endless hype and speculation, PROMETHEUS would turn out to be run-of-the-mill? It turns out to be nothing more than a completely traditional, paint-by-numbers sci-fi movie with crew members of a spaceship getting killed off messily by some nasty parasitic alien things. As this is a prequel, there are few ties to the original Alien other than some slavish moments where things have to be set up ready to tie in to the beginning of that movie (same with THE THING prequel).",/review/rw2619383/?ref_=tt_urv

","I caught one of the earliest press screenings of Prometheus, which was a grand experience, as I am a complete and utter sci-fi nut.

","Prometheus was always going to be a double-edged sword: on the one hand, you have Ridley Scott returning to the genre (and the franchise) that made his name, and pre-release info - be it trailers or the riveting viral videos hinting at important plot elements - suggested it would be a most welcome return; on the other, the Alien franchise has had a rather difficult life for the best part of two decades, due mainly to the disappointing Alien: Resurrection, which, ironically, killed the official series, and the mediocre Alien vs. Predator films, which tarnished the brand's legacy in much worse ways. In other words, this prequel (which isn't really a prequel) has a tough job to pull off.",/review/rw2619383/?ref_=tt_urv
