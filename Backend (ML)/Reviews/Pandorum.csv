27 May 2012,celiktugce,7," Really enjoyable
","First of all I want to say this, I really like animation films and I actually liked this more than the first Happy Feet. The characters felt more developed and they went through a more interesting journey. This film aims to tell to children not to lie and how important the friendship is. However I have been astonished when I have seen rude comments on Happy Feet 2. I think people are being too harsh on this movie. Some critics refused to look deeper because this is not their usual type of child animation film. I am actually shocked while reading some of the scathing reviews. Also, I think people are being too hypercritical because the first Happy Feet won the Oscar. I loved this movie and I found it far superior to Rango, Gnomeo & Juliet and Cars 2. The animation was amazing. In my opinion, it has the best production values and cinematography of any animated film of 2011, I have watched lately. The story is in-depth, layered, complex and much more meaningful than the first Happy Feet. Also, there are significant themes and messages about community, teamwork, bravery, overcoming obstacles and environmentalism. I laughed, cried and felt such empathy for these penguins because this movie has a lot of soul and heart.",/review/rw2526638/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2011,neil-476,8," Indifferent to the first one, I loved this
","I was not first in the queue at the multiplex when Happy Feet came out. Despite being a fan of CGI movies, I'm not a dancing enthusiast and, frankly, I got the joke - dancing penguins, ha ha - without actually seeing the film. Also, much as I like Robin Williams live and in straight roles, I can have enough of him quite quickly when he is voicing animated characters. Anyway, I finally saw it, and it was exactly what I expected - OK, albeit the underlying gag was not sufficient to underpin a feature-length movie.",/review/rw2526638/?ref_=tt_urv

","Mumble, The Master of Tap, has a problem because his tiny son, Erik, is choreo-phobic. Reluctant to dance, Erik runs away and encounters The Mighty Sven: a penguin who can fly! Mumble has no hope of competing with this charismatic new role model. But things get worse when the world is shaken by powerful forces. Erik learns of his father's ""guts and grit"" as Mumble brings together the penguin nations and all manner of fabulous creatures-from tiny Krill to giant Elephant Seals, to put things right. -- (C) Warner Bros",/review/rw2526638/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2011,cattjones,," A Krilly good film
","I was really looking forward to seeing this film and it did not disappoint. Although Happy Feet Two was not as good as its Oscar-winning predecessor, there were still plenty of toe-tapping moments. I liked the fact that the songs were recognizable. I am sure that L. L. Cool J is just tickled pink that they included his ""Mama Said Knock You Out"". In this film Mumble (Elijah Wood) is all grown up and learning how to be a better father to his son Erik (Ava Acres). Erik was just the cutest little thing and he pulls at your heart-strings right from the beginning. The main story line was a good one, but I think that I found the story between Bill the Krill (Matt Damon) and Will the Krill (Brad Pitt) even more entertaining. Those two had their own thing happening. I liked the way that the writer (George Miller) had two stories going on at the same time and the fact that they blended together in the end was excellent. I think that you have to have a lot going on to keep the attention of kids these days. I did not see this film in 3D, but you could tell by some of the scenes that the price of a 3D ticket might have been worth it for this film. The animation in this film was simply stunning. Animation has come a long way since Casper the Friendly ghost (I'm dating myself, huh?) Anyway, it was great. It was also refreshing to see the development of numerous female characters in this film such as Gloria (Pink) and Carmen (Sofia Vergara). I have to give props to the ladies. Robin William's character, Ramon had me cracking up throughout the film. It is not surprising that Robin really knows how to make his characters stand out since he has done numerous voice projects in the past (Genie in the Aladdin films, Dr. Know in A.I. and Fender in Robots). This film contains numerous life-lessons that I think that the target audience will understand (one person can make a difference, keep your promises, don't run away from home, etc.). If you enjoyed the first Happy Feet, then you will also enjoy this one (just not as much). Anyway, I say put on your dancing shoes, shake a tail feather and go out and see this film. I am giving this film a green light.",/review/rw2526638/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2015,Horst_In_Translation,4," Good animation isn't enough these days
","Even if there is tons of that like in this film here. I liked the first film mostly for the charm and emotional story lines, for example the one about Mumble and his dad. This sequel, which came out five years after the first, lacks completely in that area. They tried to do the same as in the first film (that won the Best Animated Feature Oscar) in some areas, for example they included once again a mix of live action and animation with the animation being the far dominant part. However, this turned out a disappointment. Not even the small fluffy penguins were a delight anymore as they were written so annoyingly with stupid rap songs and without the slightest ounce of obedience to their elders. Talking about the music, it was really really bad early on, but got a bit better as the film went wrong. Still I heavily object to the casting of Pink here. In terms of voice acting, she adds nothing to this movie, simply because she never does it. All she does is sing and her loud scratchy voice did not bring any emotion that this film was so badly in need of. She even sort-of destroyed the final scene with her rendition of Queen's ""Under Pressure"". As an animal choir the way it started I liked it, but then she started singing and all the magic was gone.",/review/rw2526638/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2011,LarissaBeth,10," Happy Feet 2 Review
","Happy Feet 2 is amazing. As a 12 year-old, I suppose I haven't watched even a total of 30 movies or such to rate this as 10 but in my opinion, Happy Feet 2 is almost as good as the first. It contains the hilarity and also amazing songs, similar to Happy Feet 1. I watched this movie with about 19 of my classmates and two of my teachers as a farewell on our graduation from school. When Erik started singing to the elephant seal, the scene itself was so sad I couldn't help but start crying. And I love those two krill, Bill and Will if I'm not mistaken...One asked the other of they could have children and the other replied that they were both males. Hilarious! My favourite quote ""We're doomed and they're dancing. Unbelievable!"" I recommend this movie to others because I enjoyed, became emotional and had a lot of fun!",/review/rw2526638/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2011,rannynm,," Happy Feet 2 - Great Family Movie Displaying Happiness and Friendship
","I love this movie. It's about Mumble (Elijah Wood) and Gloria's (Pink) baby penguin named Erik (Ava Acres) who wanders off from all the other penguins. His father, Mumble tries to find him and while he is gone a big iceberg blocks the penguins from going anywhere.

10 March 2012,TheLittleSongbird,4," Spectacular visuals, a good voice cast and fun song and dance numbers are not enough to save the thin script and charmless and heavy-handed story
","I want to start off saying that I liked the first Happy Feet. While it was not perfect, with a final twenty minutes(or so) that felt like a completely different movie, it was gorgeously animated and I loved the songs and choreography. I wasn't expecting the sequel to be as good, but I was not expecting it to be so disappointing either. Is it a terrible movie? I don't think so. The animation like with the first Happy Feet is simply spectacular, especially in the very detailed backgrounds. The characters are really cute looking too, then again I have always had a soft spot for penguins. The songs are also toe-tapping, with the best being Under Pressure, and the choreography dazzles, though I will be honest in saying that the first one in both areas was more memorable.",/review/rw2526638/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2011,TourettesPersonal,6," Extravagant
","Happy Feet is definitely one of those films that doesn't need a sequel but it has a purpose to give us an environmental message and that message became the main plot of this film. But for some reason, it's unnecessary. Extraneous characters like the Krills. There's nothing much to do with this. Just a lot of unnecessary things scattered throughout. The visuals are largely stunning and still has its powerful tone but even with those things, it still falls short.",/review/rw2526638/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2011,tavm,7," Happy Feet Two is almost as entertaining as its predecessor
","Before I review this sequel to Happy Feet, I actually looked at my comments on the previous one to refresh my memory of that one. So once again, Mumble is voiced by Elijah Wood but wife Gloria-previously voiced by the late Brittany Murphy-is now played by Alecia Moore (better known as singer Pink). Robin Williams is also back in his two characters, one of whom has a budding romance with a penguin named Carmen voiced by Sofia Vergara. Among added characters are those of Will and Bill the Krills as enunciated by Brad Pitt and Matt Damon. They don't seem part of the story at first but they will once the climax comes. Just about everyone I mentioned have some amusing and entertaining moments but things don't really pick up until the avalanche scenes come on. As before the highlights are when they dance and sing various pop songs especially when ""Under Pressure"" comes on. So on that note, Happy Feet Two gets a recommendation from me.",/review/rw2526638/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2020,briancham1994,6," Better than the original
",I'm probably the only person who likes this one more than the original. It is still not great though. The new characters like Sven and the elephant seals were interesting additions. It's optimistic how everyone works together but the story is still a bit flat.,/review/rw2526638/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2011,jdesando,," A happy kids' film

29 November 2011,sddavis63,7," The Story And Characters Are Better Developed Than In The Original
","Interestingly enough, I enjoyed this far more than I did the original ""Happy Feet."" I thought this movie had a much better developed and much more interesting (and even at times exciting) story, I thought that it had characters that overall were also better developed and most impressive was that it avoided the really in your face political message that characterized the first instalment. At the same time it held on to what worked well in the original movie - the superb animation and the good use of songs. ",/review/rw2526638/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2011,EmmaDinkins,," Chix Chat on Film review: Mumble is still heroic and he's a dad.
","It is very difficult to make an entertaining movie that has a lesson in the consequences of climate change on the Antarctic wildlife, just as it is always hard to live up to the original when you're a sequel. This sequel made the lesson entertaining but the film did not live up to the original. I really enjoyed the original and watched it many times over, I'm not so sure I would do the same with Two. The lesson in Happy Feet was clear cut and the scandalous humans did try to resolve the atrocity of depleting the penguins food source, but in Happy Feet Two nothing was really clear except that the polar icecaps are melting and now the Emperor penguins fully accept song and dance. Mumble (Elijah Wood) and Gloria (P!nk) now have had an egg of their own, and are now parents to Erik (Ava Acres). Mumble is challenged to be a good father and Erik is on a path of self discovery. The role of Gloria is filled nicely, her singing prowess made the opening Rhythm Nation production amazing, it was actually the most outstanding compilation in the entire film and would have been more fitting as the grand finale song. I unlike Catt was not thrilled by the krill, I have yet to figure out what the krill was the point of the krill storyline with Bill the Krill (Matt Damon) and Will the Krill (Brad Pitt) other than to add some big names to the film since Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman) and Memphis (Hugh Jackman) did not reprise their roles. I really liked what was happening with Ramon (Robin Williams) in this story, with the whole hatin' on The Mighty Sven (Hank Azaria) while pursuing Carmen (Sofia Vergara), the chase could have been expanded in place of the krill story filler. The movie just seemed to have a number of encounters loosely strung together with no outstanding purpose of it all, unlike the original with the fact that different can be the one thing that saves everybody. Maybe the message of this film was if humans venture to aid the wildlife and we don't succeed, they'll figure out a resolution to their problem themselves. Or when everyone works together to deal with a problem no matter how big or how small you are you can overcome any obstacle. Or maybe I just didn't get the point, which is why this film gets an amber light.",/review/rw2526638/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2011,DICK STEEL,7," A Nutshell Review: Happy Feet Two
","Happy Feet took home the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year 2007, but that film had everything - song, dance, comedy, drama, romance and of course the feel good factor. One would have thought that success meant a fast-track into getting a sequel out, but it actually took some 5 years before it actually did. George Miller assume the entire directorial responsibility this time round, with the story co-written by Warren Coleman, Paul Livingston and George Miller somewhat making this a little bit darker in tone, with much less comedy, with more of a dark, brooding overtone that hammers home its environmental message.",/review/rw2526638/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2011,u4126785,10," Beautiful animation and an enjoyable film
","I really enjoyed Happy Feet Two. The animation is truly amazing, akin to that of avatar if not better. I saw it in 3D which I highly recommend. The scenes with the Krill swarm are truly mesmerising. I found the story a little slow to start off with but once I got into it I really enjoyed it. In particular I found the Will and Bill characters (Damon and Pitt) enjoyable. It was probably not as funny as its predecessor but still makes for an enjoyable movie. I also enjoyed the 80s rock ballads and there is some great singing from Pink. I can't understand why the critics have been so harsh on this film I really enjoyed it and it is worth seeing for the animation alone. Well worth while for the whole family.",/review/rw2526638/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2011,asnerd,7," Something refreshing and very nice
","I just watched this movie at a close preview in TIFF, Toronto. I really like it, for it brings a fresh wave with it's story, characters and overall look. A lot of animation movies nowadays share quite a similar way of storytelling, and that's where Happy Feet 2 stands out from the crowd. Characters of Matt Damon and Brad Pitt worked out really well. Graphics and effects look really awesome. George Miller commented on the amount and complexity of those effects by saying that their render farms almost crashed in the process. Also I'd like to comment on 3D part of the movie, because it does really work out here, looks beautiful with 3d glasses on - gives real depth, really amazing experience. And I can't say the same for a lot of 3D movies that are out there. I would definitely recommend this movie, for Happy Feet 2 will be interesting for both children and adults.",/review/rw2526638/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2011,Erika_IMDb,9," Nice family movie just in time for the holidays!
","I gave this a 9 because, for once, 3D worked extremely well in a movie. Beautiful content once you put those glasses on! Now for the movie. A nice new twist on the Happy Feet story (I personally didn't enjoy the 1st one as much as this one). Pink did a wonderful job as Gloria but somehow I still missed Brittany Murphy's voice. Great casting done on film and it was nice to meet new characters. My favorites were Will & Bill Krill (played by Brad Pitt and Matt Damon) who in my opinion quite stole the show! My daughters (both teenagers) really liked it so it works for all ages and we all left the theater quite happy after seeing it.",/review/rw2526638/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2011,Meven_Stoffat,5," Well, the penguins are back, for better or for worse...
","Somewhere around the 30 minute mark of Happy Feet Two, there's a scene where Gloria, played by Alecia ""Pink"" Moore in lieu of the late Brittany Murphy, sings to her scared baby penguin named Erik a song called ""Bridge of Light"", while he appears trapped on an upper glacier. The lyrics seem to be a hippie anthem about how all you need is love, and how if the world had everyone love each other, and... Well, that, the world wouldn't be a so bad place, like, ya know? At that point, their peace and love causes the northern lights to start. This is where the first thing that popped up in my mind was ""people who thought the first movie was too preachy should best steer clear of THIS.""",/review/rw2526638/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2011,Chris_Pandolfi,8," Man, Can Those Penguins Dance!
","Like its predecessor, ""Happy Feet Two"" succeeds by reaching beyond the expectations of an animated family comedy. It's not that there's music; it's that the music is expertly orchestrated and perfectly in sync with the visuals. It's not that there's singing and dancing; it's that both are handled with the care and precision of a professional stage production, and that they're done on a scale large enough that it surpasses amusement and achieves an unexplainable satisfaction. Not bad when you consider that all the dancers are penguins. The animation is spectacular, the Antarctic renderings are superb, the characters are engaging, the plot is both fun and timely, and the voice work is on par with the best cartoon movies. The biggest surprise is the 3D, which is bright enough to see and immersive enough to seem uncanny.",/review/rw2526638/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2012,michaelRokeefe,7," A young penguin finds confidence.
","This is a cheery and positive sequel to the Oscar-winning HAPPY FEET. The acclaimed tap-dancing penguin Mumble(voice of Elijah Wood)and Gloria(voice of Pink)have started a family of their own. Erik(voice of Ava Acres)is a bit shy and lacking confidence because he hasn't found his rhythm and footing among his peers. The young Erik attempts to runaway and places his admiration in The Mighty Sven(voice of Hank Azaria), who can fly. Mumble starts a trek to find his son, while their Antarctic homeland becomes threatened. All is not lost; for it will take the entire Emperor Penguin nation to pull together and dance in unison to save their world...and Erik is proud to be part of the effort.

3 February 2016,anaconda-40658,2," Not Happy With Any Feet Here.
","Happy Feet 2 (2011): Dir: George Miller / Voices: Elijah Wood, Robin Williams, Hank Azaria, Alecia Moore, Sofia Vergera: Pathetic followup to the popular kids animation that seemed released on the heels of March of the Penguins. This sequel is disappointing with its evangelistic take on the Mighty Sven. This is disturbing and its target audience will not likely get it. Elijah Wood voices Mumble whose son is inspired by the Mighty Sven. This bothers Mumble but he does manage to save a father elephant seal. Robin Williams voices Ramon who finds love. The only characters of interest are Sven, voiced by Hank Azaria who is actually a puffins who fakes as a flying penguin, and two krill who seek adventure outside their normal environment. Plot melts away faster than ice in a microwave, and the climax is actually not as surprising as it should be. It involves glaciers moving and thousands of penguins trapped in a snowy valley unable to climb out. Mumble is not very interesting, and Ramon is more or less Williams doing standup. Araria brings life to Sven who means well but has a concealed past. Alecia Moore voices Gloria, Mumble's romantic other and although it is great to hear her beautiful voice in song, the role is cardboard. Sofia Vergara also lends her standout voice to this animated junk. Directed by George Miller who made Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome and Babe: Pig in the City. He is experienced in this sort of genre and is backed with stunning animated visuals, but the only feet that will be happy are those shuffling towards the exit after the film.

2 December 2011,The_Film_Cricket,," What a mess!
","Happy Feet Two is a baffling experience. Here is a movie has enough story elements for nine movies and enough environmental messages to fill a year's-worth of evening news reports. We get messages about the importance of family and friends; messages about the environment; messages about respecting each other; messages about helping each other. We get messages about pitching in, and some tired nonsense about believing in yourself and celebrating out differences. It is also overstuffed with too many characters, which wouldn't be a problem except that nearly all of the characters are penguins who, for the most part, all look alike. That's not good when you have a canvas that is packed with thousands and thousands of them.",/review/rw2526638/?ref_=tt_urv
