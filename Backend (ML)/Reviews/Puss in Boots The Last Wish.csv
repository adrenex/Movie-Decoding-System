25 December 2017,bbewnylorac,," Wonderfully intelligent series
","Some people will find the concept of a crime fighting psychic ridiculous. But the excellent scripts, direction, special effects and mostly the compelling acting raise this series above the norm. It reminds me of The Twilight Zone for its playful willingness to explore the supernatural. The plots play on our fears about the things in life we can't control. And having the main character, Allison Du Bois, being an average suburban Mom is a master stroke. She's portrayed as someone doing her best - between doing the laundry and cooking meals - to prevent catastrophes and right wrongs. She is constantly scared and baffled by the situations she finds herself in, so we identify with her by wondering what we'd do in the same situation. 
The supporting cast, including her loving husband, Joe (Jake Weber), their three daughters and the charismatic detective Lee Scanlon (David Cubitt) are all excellent and exude intelligence. Some very serious issues are explored in this series, but there are also plenty of fun scenes and playing around with time, characters and effects. 
I recently rediscovered Medium on repeat, and was reminded what a fantastic, quality show this was.",/review/rw1045309/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2013,A_Different_Drummer,9," Six Year Run 100% Deserved, Arquette Amazing
","Before we talk about the show, let's talk about the talent. Glen Gordon Caron has been on the other side of the camera for a very long time, with a pedigree that includes, oh, for example, discovering Bruce Willis. And that's just for starters. Similarly, Arquette had a long and fairly impressive run in features, not always the A-roles, perhaps, but consistent nonetheless. Bringing these two together in 2005 was a match full of promise and ultimately the promise was kept. Next, the stories. It may be because the premise was based on a real person that the week-to-week plots were entirely consistent with the way real intuitives actually operate in the real world. Ordinarily Hollywood simply cannot resist the temptation to take it up a notch, especially from season to season. Had the plot arcs followed the usual Tinseltown roadmap, the Alison character played by Arquette would be getting predictive dreams in Season 1 and raising the dead by Season 6. But the producer showed restraint, and I believe that is part of the reason for the success of this show. I have seen every episode, and I recall that by the time the last season rolled around, they were getting just a tad frisky -- Alison may have a fatal illness, Alison's ability may be illegal in court; Alison tries to help Joe's business with her gift -- but a 6 year run is nothing to sneeze at. It was consistent, it was solid, it was entertaining. In TV, that's about as good as it gets.",/review/rw1045309/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2017,mathmaniac,10," Almost a decade later...
","It's been more than ten years since the first episode of 'Medium' aired. It was one of my favorite shows - a mixture of horror, crime, and warm family drama. Today, watching the series on amazon instant video, the series is just as entertaining as it was when my kids and I first watched it. ",/review/rw1045309/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2005,Maurene,," Successful Combination of Sci-Fi, Crime and Family Drama
","I haven't been this enthusiastic about a TV show for awhile. The actors are top notch and the stories interesting. In my opinion, the core of the show is not the cases the main character (Allison) investigates or even her psychic abilities. Rather, its how her abilities affect her relationships with others (especially her husband). So far my favorite episode has been ""A Couple of Choices"" but I can't explain why. I love how the husband and children are portrayed. I have a small crush on the husband (Joe) and the kids argue with each other just like normal kids. (I got a real kick hearing the eldest daughter tattle that the younger one hadn't brushed her teeth - rather she just got the toothbrush wet.) Allison is so down to earth that she is easy to related to.",/review/rw1045309/?ref_=tt_urv

",I have watched every single episode at least 4 times. It's the only show I'll sit through and watch. Patricia Arquette is a phenomenal actress. Everyone on the show is fantastic. I really hope they bring it back one day.,/review/rw1045309/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2005,roidessinges,," Most believable paranormal show on Television
","This show is great. The main character is very believable as an ordinary housewife with an extraordinary gift. The best ting about the show is the writing; the heroine is not infallible, neither is her husband. The two kids are also incredible. Neither of them is ""precious"" or precocious, they act like ordinary girls, and the little one is downright goofy, which makes here especially charming. ",/review/rw1045309/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2005,blanche-2,," entertaining
","Since the success of ""Sixth Sense,"" many characters in the movies and on television have been seeing dead people. Allison, a law student with a husband and three kids, is one of them. This series is based on a real-life, gifted medium. She is portrayed by Patricia Arquette. Having seen the real Allison Dubois and heard her speak, this is great casting.",/review/rw1045309/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2018,kirbylee70-599-526179,8," I Saw That Coming
","In 2005 a new series premiered on NBC that caught viewers fancy and tied into that desire to know what would happen in our futures if we could. Our fascination with psychics had been a long one going back to people like Edgar Cayce and Jeanne Dixon and moving forward at the time with John Edwards. This series renewed that interest and took as its basis the real life story of psychic Allison DuBois, a psychic who has aided the police on several occasions.",/review/rw1045309/?ref_=tt_urv

16 July 2018,Kirpianuscus,," admirable serie
","First, I was seduced by subject. than, by the performance of Patricia Arquette. it is a serie about provocative theme but real exploring every day realities. that does it different. and special. the image of the bridge between us and the dead people is far to be original but, in this case, its use is more than inspired. because it is so simple to discover an ordinary wife and mother , with a special gift, fighting for truth and family and fundamental answers . short, a fascinating serie.",/review/rw1045309/?ref_=tt_urv

","The actors are very well cast, and all excel in their roles.. The writing is quite intricate, there are subtle 'teasers' (they go by unnoticed at first, and later in the episode, you realize, 'wait' they hinted at this earlier'.. quite clever.. ",/review/rw1045309/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2005,carol4pace,," Great first episode
","I was very impressed by the pilot. It quickly set up how this woman got into helping solve crimes. We did not have to slog though a long set-up, because it got quickly to the action.",/review/rw1045309/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2005,mistylynnb,," Some people do not realize that this show is based about a real life woman.
","What some people do not realize about medium is that it is also loosely based on a real life woman. She does this exact kind of work in her hometown for local law enforcement. Even if the premise is not original, the writing and acting of the show could not be better. Medium is a delight to watch. Ms. Arquette who portrays her character with such passion was and excellent choice for this role. I find myself waiting for each Monday to come around just to see what she will dream next. I truly hope this show hangs around for many seasons. It is an excellent show which I hope will continue to fascinate and entrance our minds.",/review/rw1045309/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2005,karatemom,," Never Miss It!
","I really enjoy this show. The premise is great. The paranormal aspect is handled well, and I love the interplay between the husband and wife. For me, it's a never-miss-it show, and I don't say that for too many shows. Good job! My husband had one issue with a legal aspect, but he's a lawyer so that's expected. The show I really enjoyed was the one with the husband's friend at work. I also enjoyed the show where one of their daughters made a friend at school. It was also very touching. The emotional growth of the characters is well done. One has to feel sorry for the husband, right? :-) He can't get away with anything. I also like the way they have returning characters.",/review/rw1045309/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2005,DrGreenWolf,," ""Medium"" allows for an escape - not an explanation
","I have to disagree with anyone who says this show is ""corny,"" ""unbelievable,"" or glamorizes a ""supernatural talent."" The essence of good fiction does promote the suspension of disbelief to the point in which the characters, events, and plot are believable. If you watch the show for realistic events, true plots and characters, then, yes, this show will be a disappointment. If, however, you wish to escape the constant bombardment of ""reality TV,"" this show is an excellent diversion.",/review/rw1045309/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2005,phbalanced,," Up to date version of ""Seeing Things"" (1981)
","Medium reminds me a lot of an old CBC series from 1981 called ""Seeing Things"". Both Louis Ciccone and Medium's Allison DuBois have visions and the ability to look beyond obvious clues and are instrumental in police investigations. Allison has a supportive family unit and is an ordinary mother who tries to balance family life with her part time work for the police. The addition of recurring character Det. Lee Scanlon should prove interesting in future episodes, as Allison & Scanlon did not have an amiable first meeting. And the latest episode titled ""Night Of The Wolf"" also introduces Allison's youngest daughter as also having a special gift of being able to see dead people. Looking good so far, this series has a good though not original premise. If you're familiar with Seeing Things and also enjoyed the three season series ""Millenium"" starring Lance Henrickson, give Medium a chance.",/review/rw1045309/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2009,Painbow,8," Warm, funny, thrilling, and brilliant
","Alison Dubois is a medium. She communicates with the dead but more often they communicate with her. They do this by showing her things when she dreams. She doesn't always get the complete message and taken out of context, this can mean that Alison doesn't have the complete picture which means a certain amount of investigating will be needed. Fortunately she has the assistance of the District Attorney as well as detective Lee Scanlon who are both aware of her abilities.",/review/rw1045309/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2005,glhaile,," I'm looking forward to the next episode
","My wife and I both thought the initial episode of this series was very entertaining. The premise of the show is certainly thought provoking and the hour passed by faster than my remote can skip over any ""Reality"" show I stumble onto. I thought it well written and acted, with some memorable dialogue. The Texas Rangers even sounded Texan, Though I doubt they travel in a pack, that scene was one of several visual attention grabbers. Horatio over on CBS will have to solve his crimes without my assistance as long as Patricia Arquette and all involved keep up the good work in that competing time slot. The sequencing of the story line kept us interested in the plot. I predict and hope it'll stick around. We will certainly watch it this Thursday evening",/review/rw1045309/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2011,apkatt80,10," Best show ever!
","Many reasons could be said about this show and why i think its a 10 of 10. One reason is the smart script. I cant understand how some people can compare this show to Ghost Whisperer. The characters feels real and every show is scary, smart and ""funny"". ",/review/rw1045309/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you like suspense and twists, then Medium is your show to watch.

22 March 2022,dontakeitpersonal,7," I cannot relate or feel for the actress
","I guess if her character doesn't act the way she acts there is no story. Very thick at times. For someone who has the gift all her life, I find she makes questionable decisions. I actually couldn't stand the actress as well, her acting was questionable for me. I tried to like her, but unfortunately I couldn't stand her face/way of acting during certain episodes or scenes. All the other actors, where for me more relatable and connectable. Loved them all. The storylines were great, great dialogues and filming.",/review/rw1045309/?ref_=tt_urv
