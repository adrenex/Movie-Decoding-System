14 September 2020,AlsExGal,7," I feel almost alone in the world in liking this satirical sci-fi comedy-drama
","When Norwegian scientists develop a means to shrink living things down to miniature size, with the average human standing only 5 inches tall, the world sees it as great new opportunity. ""Downsized"" people use less resources, take up less space, and have a smaller impact on the environment. As an added bonus, their ""full-size"" bank accounts translate to vastly more wealth at smaller size, since less material is needed to build dream mansions or create fabulous jewelry. Within a decade, ""downsized"" towns are springing up around the world, and middle-class Nebraskans Paul (Matt Damon) and Audrey (Kristen Wiig) make the decision to join the ""little people"". However, when complications ensue, Paul finds his worldview shattered, and he's left looking for new direction in his life.",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2017,kjproulx,6," Original, But Poorly Executed
","From Sideways, to Nebraska, to The Descendants, and even Paris, je t'aime, I've pretty much loved everything that I've seen from director Alexander Payne, making Downsizing one of my most anticipated films of 2017. Having heard so little about the film aside from its concept, I went into the screening fairly cold. Sadly, the film doesn't have a whole lot more to offer than its brilliant concept and exceptional first act. I must admit that I left feeling disappointed, thinking they could've made this a better movie in many ways. When a film has so much promise and doesn't exactly deliver on much of it, I feel as though many people would be let down by that. Here is why I believe everyone should see Downsizing, despite it being slightly too mediocre as a final product.",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2018,gazmar62,8," Much better than the ratings suggest imo
","After watching this film and then seeing the low rating for it I was really surprised, did I see the same movie ? this could have been a silly film about being small in a big world a bad borrowers concept maybe? I saw an interesting and emotional drama about an under achieved man , Paul (Matt Damon) looking for a better life, he is betrayed by the one person he wanted an improved life with. There is a message about mankind here too , our planet is overpopulated and we need to find a solution, the downsizing concept actually makes a lot of sense. As usual in the real world good ideas can be abused in the wrong hands or turned against humanity. Big or small there will always be a class system, winners and losers . Ok the film is far from perfect and loses its way a bit in the second half with the under explored imminent catastrophe angle. The quirkiness highlights come in the Vietnamese girl , Ngoc Lan Tran (Hong Chou) who takes over Pauls disappointing new life and his neighbour Dusan (Christoph Waltz) who adds a new spark, together they give Paul new purpose, a chance to make up for unfulfilled aspirations, at the end of the day what do we all want out of life ?",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2022,sherilcarey,3," very disappointing
","This idea certainly had potential. Sadly in the end it was just a vehicle for a ton of Hollywood's most stereotypical mistakes, straight out of the stereotypical problem of most of Hollywood seemingly living outside of reality or logic or common sense. It had just a very few good moments, but was overall just a kind of schlock.",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2018,ciaranmarley,9," Forget the damn trailer.
","A wonderful, thought-provoking movie that is not your usual fare. This stayed with me long after the closing credits thanks, in no small part, to the utterly magnificent Hong Chau. 
Charming without being sugary, moving without being over-sentimental, funny without being side splitting or resorting to gross out gags. The film carries several messages that are not exactly subtle but relevant nevertheless.
Wonderful special effects that fit in to the film without distracting from the story or becoming the centre piece and a musical score that also compliments.
Christoph Waltz hits his usual gold standard with ease and Mat Damon plays the bumbling everyman to perfection.
Films like this don't come along very often as movie studios tend to play safe but this is one to watch for certain, even if you end up disagreeing with my review.",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2017,namashi_1,5," A Disappointment!
","Alexander Payne is one of THE most talented & engrossing storytellers of our times. Having delivered back-to-back films that offer heart, soul & humor, its only sensible to expect the best out of him. 'Downsizing', his most expensive film to date, with A-Lister Matt Damon in the lead role, surprisingly enough, belies all the expectations.",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2018,Pairic,8," Surprises abound in this thought provoking film.
","Downsizing: Science-Fiction/Satire/Serious Comedy. Hoping to save the planet from depletion of resources, global warming and overpopulation a Norwegian scientist (Rolf Lassgard) invents a process to reduce humans to 5% of their normal height and a tiny fraction of their mass. Years later Paul (Mark Damon) and his wife Audrey (Kristen Wiig) decide to downsize to take advantage of the more affordable lifestyle in Leisureland and live like royalty. Audrey backs out at the last moment (after Paul has been shrunk) and the resulting divorce leaves Paul living in ""reduced"" circumstances in an apartment rather than a mansion and working at a call centre.",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2018,Maluga20,5," Half a good movie
","Very much a movie of 2 halves. The first half is an interesting, funny and thoughtful look at what 'downsizing' is and its implications and seemed to set up what could have been an excellent movie. 
However, the second half goes off at a tangent and starts to explore something completely different - and not in a good way. The whole second half has little reference to the titular 'downsizing' concept and whole sections could have been cut out of it without affecting the movie.
Left me feeling disappointed as it could have been very good.",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2018,Hellmant,8," I enjoyed it, as I do all of Payne's movies.
",'DOWNSIZING': Four Stars (Out of Five),/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2017,ParkingtonLane,3," Not like the trailer
","If you came to see this movie because of the trailer or because of curiosity of what a world would be like if you were 5 inches instead of 6 feet, then you paid for about 45 minutes. The other hour and a half is a completely different movie that has minimal to do with downsizing and is not what the trailer suggests.",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2017,jdesando,," Sci-fi comedy with a social bite. Fun and deeper than you'd think.
","The easiest part to get of writer/director Alexander Payne's sci-fi comedy, Downsizing, is the allegory of shrinking ourselves and our possessions to miniature to save the planet from our excess yet become miniature plutocrats in the process. The more challenging part is to understand how he can pack climate change and economic decay also into his themes.",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2017,TimmyX1,3," The whole ""Down Sizing"" concept is irrelevant
","I just watched two bad movies seamed together at around the half hour mark. The ""Down Sizing"" movie we all saw in the trailers ended around 30 minutes into the film; it would have been nice to see where that story could have gone. I think Matt and Kristin could have made a funny film together if it stuck to what the trailers were eluding too. The second story-line, starting about half an hour in, had no relevance to the characters being small. Instead, it jumped from Matt's experimentation with drugs to Global Warming so fast that I found myself in shock that I'm suddenly watching a feature with absolutely no plot. When the end finally did come, the final scene was as empty as the entire movie.",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2022,seba-ortiz-lira,4," Over disappointed
","This movie have a great premise. The first hour is very interesting, funny, and you want to know more about all the ""downsizing"" thing.",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2019,philcald,3," Not very stimulating
","One of the worst films I have ever watched. It's a shame really as the cast was rather strong. The premise started well and it simply descended into a boring storyline which is quite depressing, for some reason most of the plot line surrounds the Vietnamese character and her time in prison.",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2018,burakuytun,8," Don't judge this movie with it's trailer
","In my opinion the biggest problem and the reason for all the down votes of this movie is it's trailer. I also thought this movie was going to be a full-on comedy. Seeing Jason Sudeikis,Kristen Wiig in the trailer; all the jokes made me believe this is going to be funny to watch. Well, both of them were in the movie for like 7 minutes. Also there was this anticipation of experiencing how the ""small"" world would be but that also is a really tiny part of the movie.",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2017,borromeot,7," At Your Own Peril
","I'm a die hard fan of Alexander Payne I've been waiting for Downsizing with childish anticipation. The first few minutes of the film I felt at home. Matt Damon's wardrobe alone told me I was in male Payne territory. Matthew Broderick in Election, Paul Giamatti in Sideways - ordinary to the point of being invisible and then, the downsizing, No idea where the story goes from here and neither does Mr. Payne. There is something of John Frankenheimer's Seconds, although, clearly, that's not Downsizing's intention. No, what is Downsizing about? I never ask myself that questions because I usually don't have to, but I have to now. I have no idea if it was an an allegorical piece too clever for me or was it that the great Alexander Payne was venturing into virgin territory with one of his old invisible characters as a guide. Without having everything quite figured out. Hong Chau is lovely but was she suppose to be comic relief, tears and all? I couldn't tell and yet, I was transported and intrigued and at a certain point I was moved even if, I couldn't quite believe in the whole thing. So, go, at your own peril.",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2018,TheLittleSongbird,5," Sizeable potential downsized too early
","There was a lot that drew me in to seeing 'Downsizing' in the first place. The trailer looked good, the concept was one of the most fascinating and ambitious ones of the years and for any film seen in a while, there are some truly talented actors on board and really like Alexander Payne's previous work (especially 'Sideways').",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2021,thecamcordernest,1," Worst movie I have ever seen.
",Decided to go to the movies with a friend when it came out and decided to choose between two movies. To this day I still wish I'd chosen the other one....,/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2017,kmegal,5," I saw potential, but trailer was misleading to me...
","After seeing the trailer and prior to that not knowing a thing about this movie, I took the wife last night. I loved the concept and saw many funny people (Kristin Wiig, Jason Sudeikis, among others) in the trailer and thought it would be fun. While I wouldn't say it was a bad movie, it was SLOW and really didn't provide many laughs. Seemed to be another movie trying to push down an agenda regarding global warming and conservation rather than being a fun escape for 2 hours. If you like the actors, you might like the movie, but if you're expecting something with a comedic slant, I'd say you'll be disappointed.",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2018,Floated2,8," Interesting concept of ideas
","Downsizing may have seemed as a flop at the box office, due to its high budget expenses but overall the film is a lot better than several reviews and its IMDB rating shows. Much of the criticsm comes from people apparently being mislead by its trailer. Several of the trailers make it seem as if the film is a family friendly comedy, which it may sort of starts that way then descendes into a further interesting concept and thoughtful drama.",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2018,cruss-40884,9," Not the movie I expected, but better!
","If you're expecting a goofball, raunchy comedy, this isn't it, hence some of the bad reviews. This movie was more mature than the trailers lead on, but there is plenty of well-timed comedy, intertwined with a drama that is deep and emotional. It's the story of an underachieving man's journey from a unsatisfied life, seeking change for the wrong reasons, only to unexpectedly find true purpose and love in the process. If that's a plot that peaks your interest, then this movie delivers. The leading Vietnamese lady love interest steals the show! If you're a grown up, with a developed taste for script over cheap vulgar laughs and attention span to appreciate a heart warmer, this is worth your money.",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2018,agnieszkaszypula,8," Not as bad as the reviews
","I have seen that movie yesterday and went to the cinema with low expectation. I was not disappointed at all! Not sure what people expecting to be honest??? It was actually good movie. Good acting, good special effects and in my opinion quote good and deep story. I was emotional at the end. It made me thinking as well....I do not regret seeing the movie. That is the reason I had to write a little note....my message- go and see it yourself and then made your mind. I enjoyed it!",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2021,parul0905,1," Becomes intolerable after the break
","It started out well. Thought would be a good watch, but it starts deteriorating after the intermission, esp after the entry of the Vietnamese lady. The character is too loud and irritating at times, overpowering Matt Damon's character. Matt Damon is as usual, beyond the praise. Could have been a better watch with a better storyline in the second half and a better cast.",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2017,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,8," An uplifting and funny shrinking movie about our flawed society.
","This is probably one of the most original movies I have seen in years. Director Alexander Payne and writer Jim Taylor have taken something so straightforward with the idea of shrinking and brought a thought provoking and satirical spin to it. This film tackles political ideas you wouldn't expect like the environment, immigration and the class system. In the near future, Norwegian scientists have figured out a solution to help the planet sustain itself from overpopulation. The answer: Literally make the population smaller. Years after the process called Downsizing became available to the public, people have been getting themselves shrunk and living the tiny communities built for them. Here Payne and Taylor use this concept to explore the economic and political ramifications as the people and governments abuse the technology to avoid the world's problems rather then taking a part to fix it. Average middle-class citizens are getting themselves shrunk not to help the environment but rather as an excuse to live like royalty in downsized communities like Leisureland since their credit will be worth way more at 5-inches tall. As news report talk about the fear of shrunken terrorists sneaking past borders, governments in other countries use downsizing to oppress the people by shrinking human right groups so their voices will go unheard.",/review/rw3807694/?ref_=tt_urv
