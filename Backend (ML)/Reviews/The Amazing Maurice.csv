3 February 2022,Avwillfan89,1," I couldn't help but wonder... can a series get any worse than this?
","I was a massive Sex and the City fan. And after the 2nd movie, I was devastated and disappointed at how far it had fallen in terms of character development and writing. What I didn't realise was that this was a prototype leading up to this - whatever you want to call it - reboot.",/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2021,dd-osman,1," Oh my God
",This is worse than bad. It's depressing considering how great the original was. Kim Cantrell dodged a grenade with this one. Awful. The forced wokeness was the hardest part to take. Such a shame as it could have been great exploring Carrie and co in their 50s. It's just so bad.,/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2021,kububeach,1," Woke in the City
",Kudos to them for not trying to hide the age of the characters. But the wokeness is just a turn off. When will the movie industry realize that people don't want this type of politically correctness to be spoon fed non stop? I'm all for social justice but I don't it to be forced on me when all I wanted is just an entertainment.,/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2021,efd-10467,4," Bland and far too woke
","I don't think I've ever seen a TV show try so hard to be modern and switched on, attempting to cover every possible modern topic in a popular fashionable way, these 3 bubble headed women babble on about these topics thinking they're witty and interesting, they are not.",/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2021,MovieQween-33622,4," 4 stars for Willie Garson & Mario Cantone only
","What in gods name happened with this sequel, reboot?! They couldn't have made this any worse. I loved the original SATC series and first movie. Even loved the second movie way more than this. This feels so inauthentic, forced, disjumbled and all over the place. It's like it's a half way effort but didn't even get there. For me it has nothing to do with the age of the women. It's the writing, it's incredibly bad and the stories carry no soul or heart. That's whats missing from this, heart. The same one we all felt with the original series. So disappointing and so hard to watch. I cannot believe the horrific send off Stanford/ Willie Garson (Rest in Peace) had. If you can even call it that, he deserved so much better. They spent more time on Charlottes dinner party that Stanfords ""send off"". Utterly horrific.",/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2021,marineprincess,1," Michael Patrick how dare you.
",First if all HBO I'm so disappointed after all these years you all really thought it was Carrie Bradshaw that kept us loyal no offense because you're top notch but this isn't what we want and after all we have been through.... It's too much.,/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2021,bregund,1," Please watch this show
","The old show was boring, this reboot features lectures about gender and race, which absolutely no one gets tired of. So tune in if you want to see how the writers ruined three of these characters and one they couldn't because she wisely refused a paycheck.",/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2021,Veritas99,3," So disappointing...
","I really loved SATC, couldn't wait for the next episode...
And I was glad to hear about this show. I expected for them to look older, because they are, and I don't mind if they have some work done, is normal...",/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2021,lhollan,1," And Just Don't Bother!
","Is there one, single, solitary, political correctness issue that wasn't shoehorned into this bizarre story, and in a haphazard, not-very-believable way? The attraction to SATC was the relationship among these four (four?) women and that is completely overwhelmed by Carrie self-centeredness, the fake rebooting of 20+ year old issues, and just plain cluelessness of these supposedly smart women regarding a 2021 culture. Where have these characters been? The moon? It's as if they went into hibernation for decades and emerged with 1990 minds and with the same hair and makeup. As one top critic said...this may be so bad that you need to see it...to believe it. Sorry SATC gals, they did you wrong.",/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2021,jmgimbel,1," So not Samantha
","Jesus, it feels like whoever the new writers are never heard of our beloved fun relevant SATC much less watched it. Samantha did not need Carrie as a client AT ALL. She was straight shooting and would not give af if Carrie switched publicists. It feels like a cheap shot on purpose.",/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2022,sophiakjaer,1," sabotaged characters
","They changed every girl's personality... that was just HORRIBLE Miranda was the worst... glad Samantha wasn't part of this freak, and HYMYF is no good... skip this junk gut forever, especially if you're a SATC fan.",/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2021,catschasemice9594,5," Off the mark
","The original show was about women dealing with career, romance, and ambition. This show is about women refusing to admit that they are aging. The characters are stuck in the same old personas they had in the original show. Amanda watches a TV show and decides to return to school for a human rights MA. Now in her fifties she hasn't figured out how to relate to Black folks in spite of the dialogue that has gone on for years. Charlotte has retreated to 1959s house wife. And Carrie is still dressing in the same goofy clothing that she wore in her thirties. The funeral hat looked like a raffia frisbee. The kid characters are obnoxious. The only real character is Steve and he gets through life by turning off his hearing aids. Plus he may be on large doses of Valium. Do we need a show about wealthy women who are massively detached from reality. Nope.",/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2022,nyobatusa,1," and just like that, i stopped watching TV completely
","A show that has nowhere to go. Always ends with emphasis on frienship and being flexible. Now they mixed in the woke agenda, which really was always there but now it is so painfully dominant and obvious that I cringed at every scene. I think they milked it to the end.",/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2021,cindyrellaexists,1," Three episodes I'm out
",It's boring and the girls need to just grow up. Charlotte needs to be drop kicked and for the love of god stop with the facial fillers. Why did they dumb down Miranda? Her fire is just gone. Now Carrie is just a drip. Watching and listening to her is a struggle. The supporting characters are much better than these main whatevers.,/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2021,lisacarlson,1," Unnecessary and Terrible Writing
",There is a reason SJP is not doing press for this terrible reboot. Not that the original was anything to brag about.,/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2022,nessaree,3," Justice for Steve and Miranda!
","What the hell have you done to poor Steve? You've turned him into this bumbling caricature of his former self. Steve was Miranda's touchstone in the series and they're story was perfect. Now, he's this sad, deaf?!, clueless old man. And Miranda? The cheating storyline, her idiot kid... it all just makes no sense and it's fairly obvious the writers have run out of ideas.",/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2021,boboceaelena,1," Soooo bad
","It is funny how bad it is, I wonder how many managed to pass and continue watch it after teacher introduction moment or after the podcast scene.",/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2021,gallagherkellie,4," So woke
","It's good that the writers want to incorporate some of the current real world situations and discussions such as gender and racism, however they are trying way too hard and it's not necessary. It's kind of embarrassing and very very cringey. The way they wrote out Samantha was brutal and would never have happened like that after all we've seen of their friendship.",/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2021,Nac89,2," WTF??
","I started to watch with no expectations, a few minutes they have already spoke about every ""social justice"" subject they could cram in.",/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2021,pearlcruzpickle,1," It Ruined the Original Series
",As a hardcore fan I felt so betrayed that they ruined SATC in just 2 episodes of this. It was so wrong on so many levels I don't even know here to begin.,/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2022,saccitygrl,1," And the cringes just keep coming
","I was turned off by this reboot from episode 1 but by episode 5, my car crash rubber necking is at an end. I have tuned in after the second episode primarily because it's like the uncontrollable urge to rubber neck while driving pass a car crash--its not because you like what you see its just to see how bad it gets.",/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2021,aarpcats,2," More like the movies than the series, and that's NOT good.
","The reboot should have been named ""And Just Like Crap.""",/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2021,hello-41123,1," They should've left it alone
","I LOVE LOVE LOVE the original sex and the city that I watched it over and over again. It was always funny, unapologetic and got interesting things to say.",/review/rw7630768/?ref_=tt_urv
