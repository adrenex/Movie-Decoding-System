9 January 2020,ThomDerd,10," Wow! And what a soundtrack!
","If you love OSTs then you will love this one. Even Idris Elba is singing.
As for the film: it is just pure entertainment! Hobbs and Shaw have to work together to get the pretty sister of Shaw out of trouble and away from black superman Idris Elba, who is amazingly cool in his performance as a villain. The movie has absurd action sequences which would make James Bond change his profession to a mathematician.
The chemistry between Statham and Johnson is electric and funny.
I am not going to say anything about the cameos, they are just hilarious.
Great to see on a weeknight or a weekend or during Easter, Xmas, NYE, Summertime. Preferably on a big screen.
10/10 for the successful fan fiction attempt.",/review/rw5105577/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2019,kosmasp,8," What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?
","That is a bit what the two stars are supposed to be. Though don't ask me who is who - if you insist I'd say Statham is the unstoppable force and Dwayne the immovable object. Which would make sense, since he is the Rock ... Ok kidding aside now, we know this unlikely team made waves in the last Fast and Furious movie andwas the best thing about it. At least the funniest thing about it.",/review/rw5105577/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hobbs and Shaw (Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham) reluctantly join forces to try and find Shaw's sister Hattie (Vanessa Kirby), who is carrying a deadly virus in her bloodstream that will become active in 72 hours.

14 August 2019,UniqueParticle,9," Venessa Kirby is gorgeous and so worth seeing along with the other goofballs
","Action filled and perfect summer banter movie! Definitely one of the best Fast and Furious adaptations since the first 2 films, David Leitch is an incredible director and I love his style! I'm shocked their was only 1 other person the theater and he didn't even stay for the ending. I laughed a lot too; also it was in IMAX which is always great! I definitely would recommend this to anyone a fan of the series or not, it's still very entertaining.",/review/rw5105577/?ref_=tt_urv

2 October 2019,danhoughton,7," I wanted to hate it.
","... But I just couldn't. It was so obviously refusing to take itself seriously that you couldnt help but be swept up in the fun. Yes, it's over the top, unsubtle and about as deep as a politicians sense of honesty, but I found myself enjoying the banter. It's a movie you can watch with half an eye and chuckle at.

22 October 2019,saptesh786,8," Best spin off thriller !
",This spin off is enjoyable ride and alike from previous Fast & Furious franchise. Casting is perfect all main four characters are well fitted in their roles. Action scenes are highlighted part of the movie. Climax action sequence of Helicopter with car and tractors is brilliantly created. It is worth to watch. Jason Statham is as he was always. Dwayne Johnson is also rocking Hobbs. Surprise is Vanessa Kirby she looks beautiful with stunning performance of dangerous kick ass sister of Shaw. Whereas Idris Elba played machine ghost perfectly. His bike trailing under long truck is just watchable sequence while chasing. As me movie is worth to watch for two sequence one chasing and another last climax. Recommended to watch for every action lovers and F&F fan that will get a new taste of this franchise.,/review/rw5105577/?ref_=tt_urv

25 October 2020,Leofwine_draca,6," Effective spin-off
","HOBBS & SHAW is the first spin-off from the FAST & FURIOUS franchise not to feature Vin Diesel, but it turns out you don't miss him at all. This is because the entire film consists of Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham engaging in verbal sparring and constant insults, some of which are pretty stupid, but many of which are witty. They certain sound good in the mouths of these two enthusiastic actors and they have a real camaraderie missing in many modern buddy-buddy comedies. Aside from these guys, you get a typically bombastic and unrealistic plotline involving Idris Elba's generic supervillain, a lot of globetrotting, and typically CGI enhanced vehicle chases. It's not remotely believable, but that doesn't really matter as this is all about OTT mayhem and humorous lines in between. Plenty of fight scenes add to the fun, although it's a shame about some of the performances, but generally this works.",/review/rw5105577/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2019,cherrysunday,7," Not a masterpiece, but entertaining AF!
","Like I said, it's not a masterpiece, and it certainly has some problems, but the movie knew exactly what it needed to be and what it needed to do and it did it well. Statham, Johnson, Ilba and the rest of the cast all did a pretty good. The action is over the top but entertaining and exiting. The movie was also pretty self aware and wasn't as arrogant as the other F&F movies. And I loved the choice to make a F&F movie with such a bizarre and over the top plot.
At some points the movie got a little to repetitive and cliche for me, and some of the jokes and skits were a little bit weaker than others, but like I said this movie is not the one made to be a masterpiece, or to be analysed for messages or deeper meaning, its just a dumb summer movie but a really good one at that.",/review/rw5105577/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2019,theenigma129,6," I want more of madam M!!!
","The movie was very good. I enjoyed it. But there was one big thing That's been bugging me: I wish eiza Gonzalez had more screen time!!! Eiza had her name part of the main cast list and she's part of the poster for the movie and yet eiza and her character madam M were only in the movie for 5 mins. That's not right! (Ok to be fair, she's was already working on another movie ""bloodshot"" at that time. So she only flew to london, to be in Hobbs & Shaw for a couple of days) still, I love, enjoyed, appreciated and praised every single second of eiza's scenes, her performance and character so so very much. Madam M and all other different characters eiza had played recently and so far. (Even though they were small roles and one or two earlier movies she was in are not my favorites) but still, I love eiza with all my heart & soul and everything she has done so far. Hope they'll be a sequel to Hobbs & Shaw and eiza comes back as madam M, has more screen time and is more involved because eiza deserves it 100%
I love you eiza Gonzalez!!!",/review/rw5105577/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2019,FeastMode,2," i don't understand the love
","I am frustrated. Partly with how bad this movie turned out to be. But mostly with the reception. 7.0 IMDB, 89% RT audience rating. All of the following reviewers gave positive reviews: jeremy jahns, schmoes, austin burke, sean chandler, john campea. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. This movie was bad on so many levels. And for all of these reviewers to say, oh well you know what your getting into, this is the way this franchise is... are you serious? There is a limit. There is an extent to the disbelief we can suspend.",/review/rw5105577/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2019,amerulaidil,8," If you expect Schindler list,then you're in the wrong place
","The movie really live up audience expectation. It's dumb, ridiculous,fun, and crazy too. This why audience watch this kind of movie because of its entertainment value. The movie really offer audience a lot this time. You got Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham bicker all the time like husband and wife, ridiculous action sequence, and powerful family theme which I think very relatable for some audience. The movie also have surprise appearance by some popular actor which I think gonna get people excited more. Overall, it's very enjoyable dumb flick action movie that definitely live up our expectation",/review/rw5105577/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2019,Figgy66-915-598470,9," Good Guys, villains, chases and explosions
","12 August 2019
First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Fast and Furious: Hobbs and Shaw. Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) form a dysfunctional partnership to save the world. What's not to like? Eye candy for the girls (and no doubt some of the boys) action for the boys (and the girls), a frankly ridiculous plot, nothing really new.....our heroes on a tight time schedule to save the world ...... but the whole thing works. Admit it, we love car chases, explosions, good guys, bad guys, the whole caboodle, it began with cowboys and Indians, took us into space fighting aliens and as long as there are writers to reinvent the whole time , our film industries around the world will continue to flourish and draw the audiences to the cinemas. This film was very watchable, and although directed by David Leitch the producers numbered one Statham and one Johnson. Idris Elba made an outstanding bad guy (I personally think he'd made a great Bond). Did the Fast and Furious title make me watch it.....probably, but it was a film on its own, not as compelling as the rest of the genre but a good watch nonetheless.",/review/rw5105577/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2019,yeolit,9," Exciting, old-school and funny

3 October 2019,GDovW,8," Some scenes too long but ... Fun action movie!!
","3 points.
1. I am surprised by the large gap between scores. It looks like the fans of Fast and Furious were the most disappointed ... but the title of the movie says it: ""F&F *presents* Hobbs and Shaw"" and not ""F&F: Hobbs and Shaw"" ... so of course the style is different !! It is Hobbs and Shaw's styles !!! They are not drivers, they are not over-complicated-often-going-wrong thieves !! ... they are ACTION men !! One is a bulldozer, the other one a lets-get-to-it-then guy !
That is what the movie is giving = you KNOW what you get ! (that is why i like it)
2. It is good that they do say it is an F&F movie ... so you know at some point, it is going to be a mess, too much, out of logic, and getting too long. And because you know it ... you are NOT surprised when at some point - Helicopter Vs. Cars - it is exactly LIKE THAT: too much, out of logic, and too long (that is why i prefer to watch such movies at home => you can fast forward !!! :D )
3. Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham (2 very famous action actors) provide us a movie with funny moments (pick yours), lots of action, a view of Samoa, and very diverse environments to let go of the adrenaline ... and doing so with some actor friends in it! What else do the 1 to 5 stars voters want ???",/review/rw5105577/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2019,masonsaul,10," Extremely fun spin-off
","Fast and Furious: Hobbs and Shaw is an extremely fun spin-off and one of the best installments in the franchise. Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham are perfect and have incredible chemistry, making it consistently very funny throughout. Vanessa Kirby also gives an incredible performance and Idris Elba is great as the villain. David Leitch's direction and the action sequences are both great. The cameos are unexpected and fantastic. It's also surprisingly self aware and embraces how ridiculous it is. It also manages to continue and build on the core theme of family, which the franchise is known for.",/review/rw5105577/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2019,shawnhossen,1," Let the franchise die in peace
","This has to be one of the worst movies of the year and definitely of the series. They don't even race anymore, instead the Rock holds onto helicopters with a metal chain. I can't believe I'm seeing ratings of 10, the story was so poorly constructed it's embarrassing. These people are the reason for garbage like this and why we'll be getting Transformers 27...

10 August 2019,lark40,10," The cult of the dark Web Pulling strings of genetics a super snowflake hiding it to disperse its extermination and the rise of brixton
","As you have seen the trailers you think it gives too much away not in a long shot so As an alpha male odd couple in this Fast & Furious spin-off. Moody Brit Deckard Shaw and well-mannered Yank Luke Hobbs are forced together to take on Idris Elba's Brixton Lorr, a cybernetic bad ass with designs on world domination.Shaw's sister Hattie, a MI6 special ops agent, is along for the thrill ride as the gear-grinding franchise takes off around the globe in a hyperbolic hydraulics ingenious fights and stunning bike car chases with unique and new evolutionary gravity defying ways to a spectacular scene running on the outside of a building with jumps and running jokes between the the two whole their as breathtaking stunts are promised an action-packed extravaganza filled with all out brawls and car chases. Spectacular scenery along the way for the final third its a whole new old school games. After watching the movie, I was suprised by how absolutely entertaining it is. Idris Elba, the villain is basically The Winter Soldier(though he calls himself Black Superman) and is formidable both as a screen presence and a threat to The Rock and Statham's Hobbs and Shaw. The Rock and Statham were excellent and able to do what they did best: kick the living s*** out of people while wisecracking with a straight face.
It's all about snowflakes that will cause an apocalypse so Shaws sister kicks some ass and adds kick ass action in style to be While running down the side of a building catching up with enhanced bad guys It also helps that they are actually talented actors and make some emotional scenes believable. The car chases are spectacular and is every bit as exhilarating Every sort of model of vehicle seems to get involved at some point, from motor bikes to jeeps to trucks to helicopters. Just one thing was missing: Diesel there is two fun cameos
as The Fast and Furious franchise and even rival The Bourne series. The action choreography enables all the actors to embrace their strengths. Dwayne Johnson gets to really use his muscles while Statham uses his quick fists and kicks. Elba, nearly steals the show himself, gets to believably kick both The Rock and Jason Statham's ass. The plot is good but having Shaw rescuing his sister provides some character motivation but luckily, the movie focuses less on family drama and more on both of as the chases in dune buggies through chernobel hq explosion galore fist fights that breathtakingly good stunts that simply defy doing
The film couldn't just be ""Hobbs & Shaw"" - ignoring the franchise that spawned it - but nor is it allowed to be ""Fast & Furious: Hobbs & Shaw,"" a more traditional sequel construction. The strange compromise, in which ""Fast & Furious"" presents ""Hobbs & Shaw"" is symbolic of the Frankenstein nature of this action film. And yet, the Jason Statham-Dwayne Johnson film is still the most entertaining the franchise has been in years.
. The movie's final hour even takes the action to the island of Samoa it goes old school for our protagonist as they go back to nature and us the land spectaculary, so that Johnson can both openly embrace his heritage as part of the final battle's
there's still plenty of them, but the final hour on Samoa emphasizes more old school (and creative) fight choreography.
Great fun great humour and old school skulduggery and Hobbs past comes back haunt with a voice from his past when will we find out",/review/rw5105577/?ref_=tt_urv
