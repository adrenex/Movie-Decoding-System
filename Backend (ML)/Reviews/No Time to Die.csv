16 February 2022,Calicodreamin,5," Mediocre
","First off, great cast and amazing acting, the leads had chemistry and the emotions felt authentic. However, the score and cinematography were mediocre borderline poor. It was painfully obvious that every set was green screen. The score left too many dead moments. Also, what was with that very weird Gadot as Cleopatra moment?!",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv

","Turned in her grave, on plenty occasions in this edition of the death on the nile. I guess peter ustinov wouldve kikced his anckle too cause this edition of the poirot story is made for the new generation of agathae christie fans, not grumpy old peoople like me. How could he have forgotten his stick, and forlorn his bowler hat...IMPOSSIBLE'...",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2022,linda-glass,7," The book is a million times better
","Did enjoy this, but having read the book by Agatha Christie I can say that you should read the book instead. For a 2 hour movie it does not develop the characters or story very well but cinematography and direction is spectacular.",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,random-70778,," 3/10. Agree with metacritic consensus, this is the most lowbrow adaption of a Christi work
","I don't always agree with the professional critics, but I have to say that I do agree this adaption, is, without a doubt, the most turgid and poorly executed Christie adaption that there has been.",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2022,blott2319-1,6," A good book somewhat mangled by a mediocre adaptation
","I love Agatha Christie novels and want so badly to enjoy big screen interpretations of her stories. I think her writing is what makes Death on the Nile work better than it would otherwise. It's a solid mystery that has plenty of good twists and turns because there are multiple layers of mystery beyond just the murders. Thankfully, it has been long enough since I read the book so I didn't totally remember the actual solution to the whodunit. However, I figured things out relatively early because Branagh struggles to deliver these type of mysteries with any subtlety, and that's a shame. You'd think it would be obvious that you don't want someone almost literally shouting ""Pay attention, this is a clue!"" but that's what we have here. Also, while I said I guessed the truth early, I just mean early in relation to when the first murder occurred. Because it takes almost half the runtime for things to truly get going.",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2022,Sleepin_Dragon,7," Death on The Nile, finally sets sail, good film
","The famous Karnak, the murder boat sets sail for a third time, I have really waited for this, it has a lot to live up to, Ustinov's adaptation being one of my all time favourite films.",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2022,boblipton,6," To My Surprise, This Was Good
","I wasn't anxious to see Kenneth Branagh's version of DEATH ON THE NILE. I thought his remake of MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS was a poor imitation of Sidney Lumet's masterpiece, and his mustache awful. Previews of this movie made it apparent that he had changed mustaches, by gluing one on top of another; this made him look like Eddie Izzard. When the movie started with the Belgians going over the top against the Germans during an anachronistic gas attack in World War One, I felt even worse. Did Branagh think that stretching out the movie with Poirot's back story would make something out of a collection of tics that Agatha Christie used in place of learning how to write a character? Was this supposed to add depth to the stereotypes and make of this more than another of her perfectly plotted impossible murder mysteries? Was I going to care about any of these waxwork figures?",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2022,ferguson-6,6," the human side of Poirot
","Greetings again from the darkness. For us Agatha Christie fans, a certain amount of trepidation exists every time a new movie or TV version of her work hits. Stress level was reduced a bit this time since director-actor Kenneth Branagh and screenwriter Michael Green are back following their collaboration on Christie's MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS (2017). Although the star power this time isn't quite at the level of 'Orient', it seems Mr. Branagh has grown quite fond and confident of his own Hercule Poirot, the Belgian super-sleuth.",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2022,SnoopyStyle,6," Branagh tries
","Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) suffers facial injuries during The Great War which leads him to spot a massive moustache. It's 1937. Poirot is invited on an Egyptian vacation and a cruise on the Nile. It's a trip full of intrigue, romantic disputes, and... murder.",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,paul_haakonsen,6," Watchable, although somewhat unnecessary remake...
","Well, I can't really claim that the 2022 movie ""Death on the Nile"" is one that I was particularly excited to watch. Why? Well, it is a remake and haven't the Agatha Christie 1937 murder mystery been put to the screen enough times already? I mean, 1978 and again in 2004, wasn't that enough?",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2022,grantss,4," Once again Branagh opts for style over substance
","Hercule Piorot is holidaying in Egypt when he is invited aboard a cruise down the Nile. The host is the extremely wealthy, recently married, heiress Linnet Ridgeway. The journey is soured by the appearance of Jacqueline de Bellefort, the ex-flame of Ridgeway's husband. Ridgeway stole him away from her and she seems intent on extracting some sort of retribution. When Ridgeway is murdered suspicion naturally falls on de Bellefort but she has a cast iron alibi.",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2022,kosmasp,8," Death with a view
","I am the first to tell anyone: watch the original version. Most of the times it is better anyway - but even if not, watching the original after you've seen the remake might have already spoiled things for you. Now when I say Original in this case, I am talking about the movie with Peter Ustinov as Poirot and not the version that was made for TV (which I have not watched yet).",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2022,ethanbresnett,6," Enough bad accents to fill the Nile!
","I really rather enjoyed Murder on the Orient Express, and so was looking forward to this follow up, however was left altogether disappointed.",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,Tweetienator,4," Not Good
","Alone the first scene is a fine example that many of today's movie producers, writers and directors too many times don't understand much about what they write about or produce (or they just don't care - I don't know what's worse): take the first scene, the attack in the war of the trenches. The French use gas to hide themselves and instead of putting on their gas masks (well, gas is dangerous, isn' it?) and taking preparation for an attack (the use of gas almost always indicated an immediate attack), the Germans just say, hey, I can't see a thing, just lets stare around a little bit more or just keep on eating your soup. Next scene, we get some Blues tunes that are fine but, well, the movie plays in 1937, but the first electrical guitar ever build was a Rickenbacker in 1936, and the Blues style played belongs to the 40s and 50s... I just give you that two little examples to illustrate why the whole movie just feels wrong and even dumb sometimes - the characters of course behave and talk also out of time and place. Anyway, watchable, if you like the starred actors but compared to the movie of 1978, this one looks weak.",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,MovieIQTest,," There's a fundamental logic problem here
","The movie producers, the director and the screenplay writers ever understand what a major facial wound that caused serious facial tissues, muscles and flesh deformed so deep would have made the usual beard growth under the nose, on the sides and chin permanently ruined and impossible to grow beard or, the thistles that called beard coming out of those permanently wounded but later recovered would grow out scarcely and unevenly? Not even you have the modern day cosmetic plastic surgery or implant technique, that kind of beard on the face of Kenneth Branagh would be either a miracle or a total joke, albeit with such funny and absurd effect like what we have seen in such ridiculous view. That absurd beard on the face of the leading character was the major letdown to effect me watching this movie normally. It's not just funny, phony, fake but actually quite disgusting! I would prefer that beard on his face was a fake theatrical disguise man-made product Made in China instead of what the guy's wife suggested: Just grow a huge beard and mustachio to cover up those scars; a Mission Impossible mumbo jumbo!",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2022,yahiaaqil,6," Too long for nothing.
","The whole first hour of the movie was completely useless. It doesn't serve the plot, the drama or the character development. It should have been a one hour movie. And the French accent was exaggerated!",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2022,cjonesas,7," [6.9] Linnet Ridgeway was blond in the book and unlike Gal Gadot
","A movie that relational to Agatha Christie's masterful work gets a maximum of ""4""; relational to itself and closing eyes on the laughable ""based on"" production, it gets around ""6.5"" to ""7"" - not accounting the many blatant characters' discrepancies and ""lines"", totally unfit for 1937.",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2022,fatguy-21135,7," Definitely not the best but really not the worst
",Okay so my main problem with this movie is the beginning I can put up with the choppy story the shotty characters and stuff but the beginning of the story took wayyyyyy too long to get started but I do.recommend it.,/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2022,eddie_baggins,6," Branagh's newest Poirot outing provides more of the same
","A pleasant enough if unremarkable experience, Kenneth Branagh's first foray as Agatha Christie's famed detective Hercule Poirot in 2017's Murder on the Orient Express created enough buzz around the world to be considered one of the years most surprising box office hits, with it quickly announced in the aftermath of the films release that Branagh would be back behind of and in front of the camera again with another famous Poirot outing, Death on the Nile.",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2022,spinbunny,7," Seriously disappointed.
","I had waited for years, literally, for this movie and now that it is out, I am wondering why I was excited. (Blame the pandemic and Armie Hammer's supposedly awful behaviour for the delays...I think that at least half of Hollywood is kinky in some way, his problem was that he got CAUGHT!)",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2022,SilviaSironifromArgentina,6," Please (from Argentina)
","I beg Mr. Branagh to direct and/or produce films based on Agatha Christie's novels but NOT TO PERFORM as Hercule Poirot, anymore. Please...Not even his moustache is credible.",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2022,imseeg,4," Below average acting performances is one of it's weakest parts. And it's getting quite tedious. Better skip the first hour. Nothing happens.
","They tried, yes, they did, but what's most annoying about this movie is the below average acting performances. French and Dawn's appearance (not funny) dont make things any better. There are lots of silly accents and lots of scenes with over acting. Annoying.",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2022,preppy-3,8," Not as good as the 1978 original but still worth seeing.
",Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branaugh) is traveling on a large ship down the Nile River when a beautiful young heiress (Gal Gadot) is killed. The problem is everybody on board had a reason to kill her. It's up to Poirot to find the murderer while the bodies pile up.,/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2022,Pistol219,7," Armie Hammer sucks
",I would easily give this movie a 9/10 or even 10/10 if it wasn't for the annoying terrible acting of Armie Hammer. He ruined Loan Ranger and everything else he's in.,/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2022,grahamvr,2," So very bad
","Please, please no more remakes of what were once great movies. Kenneth Branagh has gone from bad to worse with this. Everything is so false about it, the cgi so bad. Acting is terrible, as is cast. Why do people want to make remakes of movies which were truly the best.",/review/rw8044821/?ref_=tt_urv
