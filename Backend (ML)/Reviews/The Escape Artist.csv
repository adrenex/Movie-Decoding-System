28 December 2021,iainmcleod_800,2," Went downhill fast
","Really disappointed as I wanted to like this, but it was just ridiculous. I like most of the cast in other things, cant believe so many took part in this nonsense. Police were just ridiculously inept. Script was terrible and just got worse. Actions of the main characters were implausible. I could go on, but i wont...just disappointed.",/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2021,Avidviewer-02847,4," A frustrating mess !
","From the Hollywood Reporter's review, ""At the same time, impressionable devotees of the genre are the ones most likely to recognize that the show is, itself, a patchwork of far more than six familiar serial killer movies and TV shows. Its only original aspect is the often chaotic stitching together of the familiar elements.""",/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2021,Xavier_Stone,2," Intriguing story crumbles in under 20 minutes
","Constant flash backs and weird camera work, erratic scenes and the whole production just becomes characters arguing. Non stop arguing. It gets old fast, just solve a crime, or gather a few clues. Nope, just walk blindly into every episode, argue and then flashback. Ugh. Made it to Eps 3 and bailed.",/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2021,SnoopyStyle,5," trying too hard
","A police squad investigates a serial killer who sewed body parts from six different victims into one body. The squad receives a letter with six additional names. The last name on the list is DS Nathan Rose (Henry Lloyd-Hughes), a member of the squad, who is haunted by his past. DI Emily Baxter is the leader. DC Lake Edmonds (Lucy Hale) is the American lesbian newbie.",/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2021,Good-Will,2," Starts well then gradually goes downhill ending in utter stupidity
",I liked episode 1 which was fun and also funny.,/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2022,Sleepin_Dragon,7," It's worth seeing.
","A serial killer kills his victims in a particularly bleak and gruesome fashion, a team of Detectives have to battle against the clock to catch him, a list of victims offers a glimmer of hope.",/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2021,rosemaryandthyme,2," Awful, trying to be American & it's not working
","I like UK series but this one is a struggle to watch. One of the actresses is an American, however there is also an American feel to this series. Heck, even Natasha Little has some kind of an American accent. If I wanted to watch US cop series there are many I can choose from.... but I wanted British. You Brits are fine and unique as you are, stop trying to be something you're not. Time to watch some Midsomer reruns to erase this turkey from my memory.",/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2021,catfanatic888,5," Oh no! How can a Serial Killer Thriller be so BAD???
","A FIVE was mainly because Love Lucy Hale so much. If it would have been REMOTELY OK, I would have been kinder. The premise of a super sadistic serial killer is a good start. But then it falls FLAT! I mean PANCAKE FLAT! It's like the writers wrote a premise for a story but not the actual STORY. Huge waste of time. Don't bother. I'm done.",/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2021,rpalen,7," Strayed from the novel --- but entertaining
","As usual, the film adaptation of the novel could have been great if they had stuck closer to the source material. Lucy Hale --- a Yank Detective with this team in London? Just would not happen and her character is a Male Brit in the novel. Killer is changed, ending is changed, but this version of Ragdoll can just be enjoyed on its' own as a decent mystery/thriller mini-series that chose to make major alteration from the far better novel.",/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2021,hafaball-1,6," Rube Goldberg machine for murderers
","After 3 episodes it's apparent Ragdoll is just going to get wackier and wackier and I'm on the fence if I enjoy that or not. The tonal shift from comedy and intense abyss blackness is almost as whiplashy as getting hit by a truck or set on fire: some ways characters get killed by the mysterious person on the phone that Rose, the main character, calls when he wants a serial arsonist, Mark Hooper, taken out. Unfortunately the killer leaves a Ragdoll of six people sewn together and pointing directly at Rose's apartment, what a beginning! Confused yet? The show's kinetic energy rarely lets up, which is fun but can be hard to follow at times.",/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2021,stez3,5," Poor adaptation
","Having read all the books in this series I was so looking forward to this series, the Ragdoll book is one of the best I have read in the last 3 years. Unfortunately the writers and directors have messed up this adaptation. The actors I feel have done there best with what they have been given to work with. It's almost like they didn't read the book and just adapted it from a synopsis, the characters are wrong and the show has no fluidity. Extremely disappointed as the other books are just as good but this has probably scuppered any chance of them being adapted. Just hope someone sees the true potential of the books and develops them into films.",/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2022,ranwulfs,3," Mumble mumble *insert obscure Brit slang* mumble mumble
","I've watched more Brit cop dramas then I can shake a stick at, and I've never had to use captions. This one finally got me, not because of accents, but because the actors mumble constantly to the point that dialogue is incomprehensible. They could be speaking Swahili for all I could tell. And I'm going to agree with most reviewers here about Lucy Hale's character. Whether she's intended to be *ironically* annoying or simply annoying, it doesn't matter: she's annoying. She brings nothing to the story, and I can only assume replacing a male English cop character from the original book with a female lesbian vegan American cop character is yet another symptom of the plague of ""wokeness"" that's swept both British and American entertainment these past several years. Writers and studios are so concerned with ticking every box of political correctness that they've forgotten how to produce an entertaining and (reasonably) believable story. I'm giving it three stars because I like the premise, but little else. A swing and a miss.",/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2022,thejdrage,4," Yes, the American is annoying - she's supposed to be
","She absolutely is The Ugly American: Millennial Version. Which, frankly, is annoying even to Americans. So stop complaining - that's her role.",/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2021,Jbird65,4," Dull
","Not very good at all. It's one of those programs where you get to see all the good bits in the previews. Acting was OK, American character was very annoying 'tho.",/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2021,SteelyDan_STL,4," Most confusing show I have ever seen.
","This show had an interesting premise about a serial killer collecting body parts ans sewing them together to make a gross doll. Instead it was an episode with several scenes sewn together without a cohesive theme. Several murders take place unrelated to the ""doll"" that are left unexplained: e.g. One spontaneously combusts, and a vegan dies after eating poisoned fish. So many tangents with few clues on how they connect.",/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2021,Headturner1,4," Eh
","The best part is when one of the other officers yells ""shut up no one cares about your feelings"" to the awful DC from America! These may be spoilers..",/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2021,drahmedabdelfattah,2," The message
","Like the mediocre Egyptian tv series which tortured me during my childhood in my country Egypt, any British or American show now has a message, I succeeded to finish the first episode and my blood pressure increased, the main thing in episode one is the American actress is gay and noxious and arrogant and righteous, it's really sad for me to watch the western civilisation collapsing in the hell hole of wokeness.",/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2021,gladys64,1," Terrible
",What is going on with British dramas these days. They're trying so hard to be politically correct they lose all the characters and mis fire the actual story. They're all mumbling and ive no idea what's going on. I've read the book and I loved it so what the heck happened with this piece of woke rubbish..don't care for roses story. It's just to disjointed and annoying. Don't bother with this actual rubbish. Go watch some endeavours or similar for some decent stories and acting. This is as awful as vigil which was also a good book spoilt by BBC woke.,/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2021,tezzahols,8," loved the show
","The Brits do a much better crime show than the Americans, the story is interesting and the annoying typical LA vegan cop adds a bit of humour, seeing her with her hurt feelings, while everyone else gets on with the job, looking forward to the next episode.",/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2021,Xsplizzle,2," Pretty sad
","Took about ten minutes for them to make a joke about how even white men dont like serial killers, like, whats the joke, that white men are almost as bad as serial killers but not quite as bad? Pathetic.",/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2021,FilmMcCool,3," Rubbish
","This has got to be one of the worst dramas ever, so stupid, if real cops are anything like these idiots we are all in big trouble. As an example the end of series 2 is ridiculous. The cop Rose is feet away from the solicitor who killed the prisoner, she is on the phone, all he has to do is grab her but no he stands off her with his arms out, pleading while she steps out in front of a conveniently passing truck. The same is true in series 3, the cop Edmunds is in a car being covered in water so she cannot see out, all she has to do is move the car a few feet, does she, heck no.",/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2021,nhoelbl11,1," Made it two whole episodes
","If a show can't get to a hook in two episodes, don't bother. Interesting premise but not interesting enough to be bored to tears with woke propagandists. At least try to make it less annoying with good writing instead of this slop. The Lucy Hale character is a ridiculous stereotype. It is just as offensive as any other stereotype that is currently unacceptable. This show takes preachy and offensive to a whole new level. Bravo.",/review/rw7649063/?ref_=tt_urv
