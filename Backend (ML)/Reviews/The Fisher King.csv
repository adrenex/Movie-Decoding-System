7 June 2007,jzappa,10," Coming From A Completely Different Direction Than Any Film Remotely Like It
","The Fisher King can be viewed as an oddball dramedy like several others during one's initial viewing, but then suddenly you're struck by the hallucinations of Robin Williams's character, namely the sight of the large, outlandish, scorching red figure of a demonic knight coming to kill him. Things like this seem at once to throw the film out of balance a little bit, like the film is making a straight line and suddenly makes a sharp and brief stab upward, and then back down to continue the line in the straight way it was before. One has to think about The Fisher King and realize just how largely, outlandishly, scorchingly different it is. Think about this plot when you're watching the film. You'll realize how well it modestly unravels instead of contriving itself to mystify us. The filmmakers show no ego and are not interested in impressing themselves. They are telling their vivid, dynamic story the way good films are made. The story is just completely fresh and new. And with that in mind, thinking outside the box along with Terry Gilliam and Richard LaGravanese, one shouldn't even think of the brief sporadic fantasies the film splashes at us here and there as anything so jolting.",/review/rw1126266/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2005,lee_eisenberg,10," Robin Williams should have won an Oscar for this movie
","""The Fisher King"" is one of those movies that shows how, although we can't get over certain incidents, they may end up leading to our redemption. Jeff Bridges plays Jack Lucas, a New York radio talk show host. One day, he makes a mean remark to one of his listeners, and the listener murders some people. When it gets reported that the man had done this after a remark by Lucas, Jack knows that his career is over, but also realizes how he has been affecting people.",/review/rw1126266/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2001,Schlockmeister,," Movie with depth
","The movie's plot has been discussed enough, no need to rehash it here. I just wanted to add a few observations. In my opinion this is one of Robin Williams' best performances. I know that at the time he was heavily involved in Comic Releif and this story about mentally ill homeless men and acceptance of all types of people really fits the PC Comic Releif mentality, but he really did a great job here, portraying Parry, a man lost in fantasies of knights and ladies.",/review/rw1126266/?ref_=tt_urv

","A touching yet humorous tale, THE FISHER KING brings together amongst the best performances given by Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges, as well as Terry Gilliam's finest directorial effort.  Solid supporting performances by Amanda Plummer and Mercedes Ruehl round out a great film that ranks among my personal favorites.",/review/rw1126266/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2004,McGonigle,," The perfect Robin Williams movie (and much more)
","This movie is really exceptional in a lot of ways. It's got one of those plots, full of ironic reversals and personal struggle, that's been turned into melodramatic trash in every creative medium ever invented. With Robin Williams as the magic crazy guy and Jeff Bridges in an 80s ponytail, the ways the basic concept could have gone awry (in other hands) are truly frightening to contemplate. But with Terry Gilliam at the helm, The Fisher King speaks to your emotions more directly and powerfully than 90% of the movies out there without degenerating into sappiness.

13 March 2003,george.schmidt,10," Heartbreakingly hysterical dramedy; one of my all-time faves
","THE FISHER KING (1991) **** Robin Williams, Jeff Bridges, Mercedes Ruehl, Amanda Plummer, Michael Jeter, Tom Waits. Brilliant tragic-farce about a shock jock radio personality (Bridges in top form and criminally overlooked for an Oscar nod!) who goes over the brink into madness when he inadvertently causes a tragedy that he ends up reliving when he comes upon a homeless man (Williams equally brilliant, Best Actor nominee) that has become that way due to his actions. Repercussions and setbacks aside, intriguing character study despite some broad strokes. Daring direction by Terry Gilliam and Ruehl (Oscar winner, Best Supporting Actress) is dead-solid perfect as Bridges' taken for granted lover. Pathos and pathologies aplenty. Astonishing screenplay by Richard La Gravenese (who has a blink-n-miss cameo in the first asylum sequence; he's in a strait-jacket). Look sharp for Kathy Najimi as a video store patron Bridges insults and David Hyde Pierce as Bridges' agent.",/review/rw1126266/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2008,dead47548,9," One of Gilliam's best.
","Arguably Gilliam's best film, and certainly his best acted. As usual, Bridges is completely natural and absorbed in his role. This is the only time I've seen Robin Williams combine his best humor with his severe talent for dramatic work. He seamlessly switches from being wildly charismatic to being an empathetic, heart broken man just trying to escape his past. The basic structure is one which has been done many times, but never has it been mastered as Gilliam has done. The parallels in the story are remarkable. Parry's name being short for Parsifal, a knight of the Holy Grail. Parry saves Jack just as Parsifal saved the Fisher King. Also, Parry's flight from the Red Knight is reflected from Parsifal's battle with the Red Knight. Another parallel is seen when Parry's haunted past is brought back to him after kissing Lydia, just as Parsifal is reawakened after kissing Kundry. Gilliam creates all of this beautifully, yet keeps it very subtle and light. The film itself combines outrageous humor, heartwrenching drama and even some thrilling chase scenes. The hallucinations and flashbacks also have a very haunting ambiance to them. The film really is a tour de force on all fronts. As always, Gilliam creates a very haunting yet comfortable ambiance through some of the best cinematography I've ever seen.",/review/rw1126266/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2019,classicsoncall,8," ""Did you lose your mind all of a sudden, or was it a slow, gradual process?""
","There's no doubt the role of Parry was made for Robin Williams' boundless energy and manic personality. It's only when you learn the tragic circumstances of Henry Sagan's transformation into a seeker of the Holy Grail that you begin to understand that his trauma was caused by the indiscreet remarks of a radio shock jock who took things one step too far. I'm becoming fascinated by Jeff Bridges' range as an actor, having seen more recent films like ""Crazy Heart"" and ""True Grit"", but he goes full circle here through a range of emotions that will leave you stunned. In the story, Parry's mental illness hinges on a severely traumatic event, and Jack Lucas (Bridges) takes it upon himself to seek some measure of personal redemption by bringing Parry back to reality. While dealing with his own personal demons, Jack glides through his hellish existence with the comfort and understanding of a determined woman who's better instincts would have thrown the bum out long ago. Recognizing that the linchpin to Parry's salvation might be introducing him to an unattainable dream girl, Jack and girlfriend Anne (Mercedes Ruehl) concoct a scheme that brings all the parties together in a last ditch effort to achieve Parry's salvation. Though the plan is interrupted by a tragedy that puts Parry in a coma, it compels Jack to seek out Parry's mystical Holy Grail, and a satisfying conclusion to a tale of two couples who might have otherwise ended in oblivion. As much as I was intrigued by the story, what really put it over the top for me was when Robin Williams' character broke out with that rendition of 'Lydia, Oh Lydia', a song I thought I would never come across in a movie again, after first encountering it in the 1939 Marx Brothers picture, ""At The Circus"". With Groucho's zany rendition, I couldn't get that melody out of my head for about a week after hearing it.",/review/rw1126266/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2006,radseresht,10," Still amazing on a 4 inch screen
","When i first rented this movie out, it was like an enchantment, even on a 4 inch screen. It was a tape but still, i felt the magic in the movie its self. But the Fisher King is more than a movie, it is a story of redemption, madness, guilt, sanity, poverty and love. In the movie, all these things come together. Jeff Bridges was always a well respected Hollywood actor. In the Fisher King, he plays a role a lot more different than the star man. He plays a radio talk show host Jack Lucas, a wild, arrogant radio DJ who's advice causes a man to assassinate seven people in a restaurant. Jack Lucas did this unintentionally, but as a result to that, he is now down and out in poverty. When almost killed by thugs, a insane homeless man (Robin Williams), saves Jack, and in the end turns out to be the husband of one of the restaurant victims. Parry (Robin Williams) has lost his sanity because of that. Jack feels so muck guilt that he wishes to help Parry meet with Lydia Sinclair ( the girl that Parry likes, played by Amanda Plummer), and help him find the one thing Parry treasures, the Holy Grail. The performances are incredible. Particualary Mercedes Rhuel, Robin Williams, Amanda Plummer, andJeff Bridges, they stole the show. This should be in the library of the top five fantasy dramas in Hollywood.",/review/rw1126266/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 1999,CarolCC,," A film of power, substance and poetry
","I recently saw this movie again. (actually I felt compelled to buy it at a video sale).  I have always loved it and I continue to be moved by it. The story has such a romantic and poetic quality.  It examines the nature of redemption born, not out of guilt and obligation, but out of a truly selfless act of love for another person.  The film rivals ""The Shawshank Redemption"" in its vision of the triumph of the human spirit, and the elements of fantasy are absolutely breathtaking, especially the scene in Grand Central Station.  Definitely one of Robin Williams' most moving performances.",/review/rw1126266/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2006,symbolt,10," a modern romance
","This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I kept returning to it over they years and I always found it a great and enriching experience to watch. I especially like the shifting incarnations of the legendary Fisher King in this film (the wounded hero, kind of the wasteland, keeper of the holy grail. The archetype of the knight and of the wounded warrior can be seen as one of the prominent archetypes of masculinity we have. By this view, this movie can be seen as a research into masculinity as such. The performances by Bridges, Williams and Ruehl are exquisite. The eighties' New York is a great setting for this ethereal, symbolic quest, and the surreal theatricalness of some of the scenes (a la ""Brazil"") only adds to the overall artistic congruence of the film. The visuals are great. The movie works on many levels, so apart from this very abstract layer, we get a funny and intelligent comedy about modern misfits - with a great love story, or two. Also, I especially recommend this movie to anyone who loves New York City.",/review/rw1126266/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2015,SnoopyStyle,6," crazy acting from Robin Williams
","Jack Lucas (Jeff Bridges) is an arrogant selfish call-in radio DJ. His rant against yuppies causes a madman to commit a mass shooting in a hip NYC bar. Three years later, he's a drunken mess working at a video store with his girlfriend Anne Napolitano (Mercedes Ruehl). Jack is attacked by a couple of young punks and he's rescued by Parry (Robin Williams) and his group. Parry sees himself as a knight on a quest for the Holy Grail and hounded by an imaginary Red Knight. He thinks that Jack is the one to find the Grail so that he could win the heart of Lydia Sinclair (Amanda Plummer). Jack finds out that Parry is actually college Professor Henry Sagan and his wife was killed in the bar by that madman. There is a lot of crazy acting from everybody especially from Robin Williams. It's a little touching. It's a little surreal. It's a stumbling affair with fits and starts. It meanders a bit and I wish it's more of a quest movie. It's cute sometimes like the date. At other times, I can't wait for the movie to pick up the pace.",/review/rw1126266/?ref_=tt_urv

14 December 2007,Steffi_P,10," ""You find some pretty wonderful things in the trash""
","This was Terry Gilliam's first film produced back home in his native USA, perhaps a deliberate move to help further establish himself as a serious film director in his own right, and get away from his image as an interesting offshoot of Monty Python. Gilliam had certainly created his own distinct style with the four films he made in the UK, and they are by no means bad  Brazil is an outright masterpiece  but with their British-made look, quirky humour, not to mention the odd ex-Python among the cast it was understandable that he would want to move on to a different setting and get out of the Python shadow.",/review/rw1126266/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2008,moonspinner55,3," Commercial perhaps, but with more vitriolic cant than genuine heart...
","Terry Gilliam's typically overreaching style does nothing for this underwhelming material about an unfulfilled radio shock-jock in New York who goes into hiding after suffering career misfortune, learning to live again after meeting an ex-professor who is now some kind of guru among the homeless. Literate perhaps but meandering, self-important comedy-drama, with Jeff Bridges visibly struggling on-screen alongside Robin Williams. Mercedes Ruehl won a Supporting Actress Oscar for showy, one-note role as Bridges' girlfriend. Williams, in free-association mode, attempts to steal the picture with his ranting, but he's mostly a nuisance. Overbaked folk lore and fairy tale symbolism detract from the narrative, and Gilliam is never able to move the audience emotionally with his heavy handedness. *1/2 from ****",/review/rw1126266/?ref_=tt_urv

14 July 2005,jboothmillard,10," The Fisher King
","From Monty Python star and Golden Globe nominated director Terry Gilliam this is a great fantasy drama. Basically Jack Lucas (Golden Globe nominated Jeff Bridges) is a talk DJ, and was in a TV sitcom, and one night he is almost suicidal, but was stopped when thugs attacked and almost burned him. But he was saved by crazy street living tramp, Parry (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Robin Williams). Parry tells Jack he is on a quest to find the ""Holy Grail"" (a cup trophy), but Jack tries to help him by giving him money, that he doesn't know what to use on. Parry also suffers from terrifying hallucinations of a Red Knight, mixed with the memory of his wife's death. But then Parry tells Jack of the woman he has been seeing for so long, the woman he has fallen for and been following for ages. They find out her name is Lydia Sinclair (Pulp Fiction's BAFTA nominated Amanda Plummer), and they convince her she has won a new card, and with the help of Anne Napolitano (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Mercedes Ruehl) and her nail varnishing, they set a date for a dinner. Parry and Lydia get on really well, and were practically made for each other with their traits, but it soon goes wrong when Parry's flashbacks come back and he is beaten by the thugs, and put into a home. In the end though, Jack helps him by stealing the ""Grail"", from a suicidal man, and both couples, i.e. Lydia and Parry, and Jack and Anne live happily ever after. Also starring David Hyde Pierce as Lou Rosen, Kathy Najimy as Crazed video customer, This Is Spinal Tap's Harry Shearer as Sitcom actor Ben Starr and Michael Jeter as Homeless cabaret singer. With great comedy moments, particularly from the fantastic Williams, this is essential for fans or him and Bridges. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Music for George Fenton and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Outstanding!",/review/rw1126266/?ref_=tt_urv
