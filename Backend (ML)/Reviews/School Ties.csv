","I love cheesy underrated movies like this! It really is like a mix of X-Files, Alien, Robocop, and Terminator. Loaded with an awesome cast and some ridiculous mindless writing not meant to be taken seriously. Sci-Fi like this really should be appreciated more!",/review/rw0440046/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2019,Clive_W,5," That's one hell of a flare
","This is a terribly great film, everything that is wrong with this flick just couldn't stop me from laughing, got to love 90s sci fi sorta b movie level, though we do have quite the cast everything just feels very off with the film, yet if you want to enjoy something for a laugh this would be the film, the effects are poor, the acting is very wooden, and the plot is well been done many times before. I first court this film on late night tv in the uk back when channel 5 used to do there late night films that were always guaranteed to be a terrible movie and had the wonderful pleasure to rewatch the film found on YouTube, this is a little bit of a guilty pleasure. Enjoy!",/review/rw0440046/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 1999,LJ27,," I liked it anyway
","I've heard people trash this movie left and right yet I found that it kept my attention for the duration of it's running time and all the technical aspects were top-notch (especially Tippett Studio's CGI realization of Goliath).  The characters weren't great and weren't bad either.  Sure, we've seen it all before in other films but I have little hope of finding a film that's completely original.  Frankly, I got about what I expected out of it - motion picture fastfood.  You enjoy it as you take it in and digest it and forget about it after you leave the theater.  It's just entertainment and not bad for what it is.  Unlike LOST IN SPACE or BATMAN AND ROBIN, this film isn't boring.  It moves at a quick enough pace to where you don't find yourself checking your watch all the time.  I'm not sure what the deal was with Donald Sutherland's character who displays no sense of logic whatsoever.  Had they dropped the stuff with his character, it would've helped the film.  If you're bored, check it out.  It's worth at least one viewing.",/review/rw0440046/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was pleasantly surprised by this entertaining B-movie which, while hideously clichéd, still manages to deliver the goods in terms of suspense. It's a fast-paced action adventure which flies by while you're watching. Okay so the plot is really just a jumble of bits from THE TERMINATOR and ALIENS to STAR TREK and HARDWARE plus more than a nod to last year's DEEP RISING, but it's given a fresh perspective via some expensive-looking sets and a glossy sheen.",/review/rw0440046/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2004,willywants,," Come on, it isn't THAT bad!
","After losing their payload the ramshackle, sinking, ocean-going salvage  tug ""Sea Star"" takes refuge in the eye of a typhoon in an attempt to  make repairs. Whilst trying to find help the tug, captained by Robert  Everton ('Donald Sutherland' ), discovers a Russian science vessel  adrift in the eye. The crew believes their troubles are over and they  are set for life when the captain informs them of the value of  salvaging this apparent ghost-ship. However, the navigator Kit Foster  (Jamie Lee Curtis) and the chief engineer Steve Baker (William Baldwin)  are not convinced that it will be that easy. Once power is restored to  the ship strange things start to happen and the crew mysteriously  disappear one by one. It isn't until the discovery of the last  remaining Russian crew member, the chief science officer Nadia  Vinogradiya (Joanna Pacula), that the crew realize the enemy ranged  against them isn't the Russians but something far more malevolent.  While I'll admit that the plots is hacked from dozens of other (Mostly  better) films, 'Virus' is no where as bad as others have made it out to  be. Jamie Lee Curtis is likable in the lead and the special effects are  terrific! The film is an entertaining and fast-paced sci-fi horror  movie. It was gory too.  I enjoyed it. 6.5/10.  ABOUT THE DVD: Universal has done a terrific job with the release of  the virus DVD. The crisp looking 2.35:1 wide screen transfer looks  great. There's little to no grain, sharp colors, solid blacks and  realistic flesh tones. The Dolby digital 5.1 audio is very effective. I  loved them gunshots! Gotta have your gunshots! Extras are great, too.  The commentary, provided by the director, John Bruno, select cast  members and the composer is an enjoyable track filled with  behind-the-scenes stories and is quite informative. Next up is a very  good 17-minute documentary, Ghost in the machine, covering everything  from special effects construction to cast interviews. Next up are a  collection of 4 deleted scenes (Shown in there rough-cut form), which  are pretty enjoyable in there own right. Next up is a tiny 6-minute  featurette, which is really just a rehash of the documentary. Also  included are production notes, DVD-ROM features, a trailer, and really  cool animated menus. Nice!

","""The Terminator"" meets ""The Predator"" and ""Alien"", and what we get is this routine but moderately effective horror thriller, which isn't quite as bad as its reputation might lead you to believe. Sure, it lacks substance and (except for a few details)originality, but the energetic direction, the fast pacing and some impressively filmed explosions keep it painless.

","A mediocre storyline (i.e. Titanic) can become a world class film with character development, believable dialogue, and, for lack of a better word, some Hollywood magic. This film could have been a blockbuster with less action, less noise, less effects and more humans being human. Look at 2001 A Space Odyssey, Jaws, Titanic and countless other films, and you'll see that the story was about as interesting as Virus, and the actors, equally talented.

","Decent sci-fi horror/thriller. OK, it's not exceptional in any way but it's also not the steaming pile of poo that its rating here would suggest. I was expecting it to be a real stinker judging by some of the reviews I've read. On the contrary, it was a perfectly watchable movie of its type. Entertaining to a small degree but never dull. The cast isn't bad. Jamie Lee Curtis is the best of the lot. Donald Sutherland hams it up some with a silly Lucky Charms accent. I ask you though -- in what way is that not fun? Maybe people hate it because it has a ""dumb action movie"" quality about it. Sci-fi fans can be a prickly sort sometimes.",/review/rw0440046/?ref_=tt_urv

","What I noticed about ""Virus"" is that ANYTHING can happen to ANY of the characters.  They actually get the crap beaten out of them, even Jamie lee. The special-effects are fantastic for this film and the robots are actually menacing.  The characters aren't too interesting but they suit the film.  I was surprised at how the movie wasn't as predictable as I thought it would be.  ""Virus"" takes a new direction.  Instead of having a bunch of aliens or monsters running around, killing people, they have robots.  It's an original idea that hasn't been tackled that often in this type of genre.  A good movie.",/review/rw0440046/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2007,Dr_Coulardeau,9," Welcome to ET hybridization
","Post Cold War science fiction. No more Soviets. The Russians are not dangerous and the Chinese are not yet in the picture, not to speak of the terrorists. So danger had to come from the sky, hence from the cosmos, hence some immaterial living form, at least immaterial according to our definition of matter. They just take over any kind of communications network and have at their disposal the whole sum of human knowledge, plus theirs, and they start spreading. They take over a Russian scientific boat and then recuperate anything, computer parts, mechanical parts and human parts, to build some hybrid beings that can take the control of the ship and then go to some human harbor and invade the planet. But it all goes wrong when some real human beings decide to use their intelligence and training to destroy these hybrid beings, the extraterrestrial cosmic being behind and sink the boat. And we are really after the end of the Cold War since it is the last female Russian survivor who will sacrifice herself to slow down the main ""machine"" so that the two last Americans will be able to escape while her sacrifice will start the setting on fire of the ship and the blowing of it up and down into the sea. A little bit simple, though quite entertaining if you like that kind of paranoid science fiction: the human species is always menaced, from inside or from outside, and it is always thanks to the sacrifice of some who use their intelligence and know how in a creative way that the planet and humanity are saved. Paranoid and naive. And the final couple that escape the ship is of course a man and a woman. Adam and Eve not dead yet.",/review/rw0440046/?ref_=tt_urv

The tugboat Sea Star is towing a barge with cargo not covered by insurance when she crosses a typhoon and loses the cargo. The alcoholic Captain Robert Everton (Donald Sutherland) is informed that the engine room is flooded and the bilge pump does not have enough capacity to pump all the water overboard. Captain Everton is ready to commit suicide when the tug stumbles upon the Russian vessel and he believes the salvage would worth about thirty-million dollars. Captain Everton and his crew goes onboard of the dead ship considering derelict and soon they find the Russian officer Nadia (Joanna Pacula), who tells an incredible story. She explains that an alien force needs electrical power to build robots and destroy the human race, but they believe she is haywire.

The setting, plot development, characters, ending,... are all far from original but the premise of this movie sorta is.

Jamie Lee Curtis looks remarkably normal playing a sailor, Donald Sutherland delivers another good villainous performance, and new actor of the year Cliff Curtis (Three Kings, Bringing Out the Dead) is excellent.

28 August 1999,Holohead,8," This is what I always imagined the BORG to really be like!
","After reading less than favourable reviews, I was concerned this movie would not live up to the potential of the plot scenario. That is, an Alien entity arriving on Earth and fusing humans, or parts of humans, with mechanical technology to further it own existence.Fortunately, the movie lived up totally to my expectations. We start off with a BANG! and than it's non-stop, sit on the edge of your seat stuff until the end. Anyone who watches STAR TREK knows the BORG. This movie makes what we've seen of the Borg look like a stroll in the park. Whilst extremely graphic in nature, VIRUS's depiction of this Aliens handiwork is as it would be...gruesome! Without giving away the plot, you have a claustrophobic situation reminiscent of ALIENS with Jamie Lee and Bill Baldwin & crew being hunted down one by one. Chase scenes involving a multitude of half human/half machine monstrosities keep coming at you like Arnie in TERMIMATOR. The special effects and art concepts are original and really make this movie stand out. Interestingly you'll see Mr. James Cameron thanked in the fine print of the credits. The mechanical marvels are certainly up to his standard. I loved the movie and now on DVD its straight into my collection.",/review/rw0440046/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2006,BaronBl00d,3," Clichés - All Aboard!
","Laughable, extremely poorly scripted and acted effort about a small crew boarding what seems to be a ""dead"" huge Russian science ship that has been taken over by an alien life form in the form of electrical current. The small crew from the other ship quickly find out that boarding the ship was a bad idea, and soon they begin to, I know this will surprise you, ...DIE. Okay, for starters the film is very derivative of other films, most notably Alien with the same premise of a small group investigating a large ""foreign"" vessel and ultimately led by a strong female protagonist. Ther are many other obvious similarities, but time and a total lack of desire to rehash that drivel must excuse me. I could live with a less than original story if it had some better dialog and some characters you might give a hoot about, but Virus has none of that. Jamie Lee Curtis does a serviceable job at best and gives the film's best performance, but that is not saying anything as virtually everyone else is just awful. This is a surprise when one sees Donald Sutherland's name attached to this project. I have never seen him give quite as bad a performance as he does in Virus. He goes for every cliché and stereotype of an old sea captain save a wooden leg and a parrot on his shoulder. The accent he uses I found excruciating. The rest of the crew has a group of guys that you will not care about in the least. None of the guys can act. This applies mostly to male ""lead"" Wiulliam Baldwin who looks like he is lost at sea playing an actor. The script aids the actors in being inadequate as half the time it just makes no sense and other times begins to show promise and ends abruptly. Wow, the way Jamie Lee Curtis gets out of a jam near the film's end was so ridiculous. What about the captain and why he was almost going to shoot himself in the beginning of the picture? What was that all about? It was never brought up again. What does Virus have going for it? It is the very embodiment of mindless entertainment with almost no thinking required. The special effects are pretty good too. But for me the film was a great big let-down. Not that I was expecting something great, but I was expecting something suspenseful. I was laughing and turning my head a lot more times in this one then I was on the edge of my seat - except when I was ready to turn the movie off!",/review/rw0440046/?ref_=tt_urv

26 May 2012,Hey_Sweden,5," Best left to undemanding, forgiving genre fans.
","""Virus"" is not as bad as its reputation would indicate, even if star Jamie Lee Curtis herself feels that this is the worst thing she ever did. It's certainly not without its drawbacks - dumb and clichéd characters (the coward, the one who gets victimized first, the psycho, the no-nonsense hero, etc.), silly dialogue and silly moments, a familiar feel to it - but, taken for what it is, it provides some adequate entertainment. It makes sense that its director is John Bruno, whose background is in special effects, as it's often a showcase for some interesting and decently executed effects, with such luminaries as Phil Tippett, Steve Johnson, and Eric Allard contributing their talents. The story has a tugboat taking refuge from a hurricane by resting in its eye, and coming across an abandoned Russian research vessel that we know has already been overwhelmed by some weird phenomenon. It turns out the culprit is some sort of living alien electricity that has infested the computer on the vessel and manipulated its robotics department to come up with some amusing if not terribly imaginative human-robot hybrids. The movie has the look of quality - it's photographed by David Eggby (""Mad Max"", ""Pitch Black""), who does a cameo as a captain, and designed by Mayling Cheng - and features a booming score by Joel McNeely. The actors really do their darnedest, no matter how badly written some of their roles might be. Jamie Lee is worth watching as always, William Baldwin is okay as the male lead, Donald Sutherland a total hoot as Jamie Lee's crazed and sleazy superior, and lovely Joanna Pacula is great as the traumatized survivor of the initial attack who tries to help the newcomers; also appearing are character players Marshall Bell, Sherman Augustus, Cliff Curtis, and Julio Oscar Mechoso. Provided one can turn off their brain and just laps up this kind of thing anyway, it is possible to be entertained by ""Virus"". As for Jamie Lee's own opinion on the matter, she certainly has done better films in the genre, but this isn't the total fiasco it's made out to be, either. Just go in with your expectations low.
