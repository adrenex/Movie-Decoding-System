9 February 2018,tr91,9," Derry Girls
","Derry Girls is one of the best new comedies I have seen on TV in recent times. There's great chemistry between the lead characters who are all likable and have their own hilarious personal traits. The supporting cast are also excellent, Grandad Joe in particular I thought was very funny. I laughed a lot throughout the series and it also handled some sensitive subjects very well. I am glad that it's already been confirmed we will have a series 2!",/review/rw4677862/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2019,Lejink,8," Derry funny indeed
","I'd almost given up on TV sit-coms, in fact the last one I really enjoyed was ""The I.T. Guys"" and how many years ago was that? Anyway, it was my wife who alerted me to this series and a quick look at the first two episodes of the second series found me looking up series one which she'd already watched and I have to say she wasn't wrong, as I found it absolutely hilarious.",/review/rw4677862/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2020,planktonrules,10," I love seeing the girls....and James.
","""Derry Girls"" is a very clever comedy set at a girls school in Northern Ireland during 'the troubles'...the era when the IRA and the British Army were still at war with each other. Yet despite this situation, the show manages to be very light, funny and original....and is a treat worth seeing. My big complaint, however, is that the show is too good...to well written and with too likable characters. This is because the show was interrupted by COVID and I was left chomping on the bit waiting for MORE!!! In other words, the show really leaves you wanting more....and it's currently very frustrating as I want MORE!",/review/rw4677862/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2018,Tweekums,9," Very funny but not for the easily offended
",One might not think that a city so divided that what you call it identifies which side of the divide you are would be the first choice of where to locate a comedy; especially if it was set at a time when there were troops on the streets and the threat of sectarian violence was very real but somehow 'Derry Girls' works. As anybody in the UK or Ireland would guess this follows a group of Catholic girls in the city of Derry in Northern Ireland (had they been protestant it would no doubt have been called 'Londonderry Girls). The humour is such that people of whatever persuasion are likely to find it equally funny/offensive.,/review/rw4677862/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2018,Saiph90,10," One of the best comedies I have watched in a long time
","Last night was brilliant loved the line ""they are practising"" ""you would think after three hundred years of playing the same song the would have learnt it by now"" might not be word perfect but that is the gist, excellent writing, acting and really funny. Look forward to it every week.",/review/rw4677862/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2019,bjbsf,9," Brilliantly Conceived and Written
","Hilarious, quick, quirky and brilliantly written. Funniest thing on Netflix. Set in Northern Ireland during the troubles, the jokes come from all directions-family, growing up, fitting in, Catholic schools, the folly of religious conflicts, and on and on. Lisa McGee has created a phenomenal show populated with engagingly funny characters everywhere you turn.",/review/rw4677862/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2019,Robwiener,10," You Don't. Have To Be Irish To Love This Show
",One of the top 10 funniest shows I have ever seen and I am a 65 yr. old American. I just binged Season 2 and happy to report Season 3 has been confirmed. I don't often laugh out loud in my home when viewing comedy yet every episode has made me do so. Every cast member is brilliant and so is the writing. I was utteriy amazed that Clare and Michelle are in their 30's. The other 2 girls are 25. It is a testament to their acting ability that they portray teenagers so convincingly. I hope Season 3 has about 10 episodes instead of 6.,/review/rw4677862/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2019,Lee-107,10," Hilarious!
","I haven't laughed so much for any how of late as I have for this one. Saw this on Netflix and can't recommend it highly enough. I thought all the actors did a fantastic job. I especially liked Siobhan McSweeney who plays Sister Micheal. She's an absolute hoot and a real scene-stealer. Her deadpan dialogue delivery left me in splits. The script of this show is extremely witty. It really captures the angst and the indignation that the characters feel in the funniest way possible. I found myself remembering my ""rebel without a cause"" teenage days while watching this show. The principal cast - the four girls and James - share great chemistry and have done a fantastic job making sure the funny lines from the script really land. It's a pity this show only has 6 episodes. I liked it so much, I've seen it twice and really want more!",/review/rw4677862/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2019,co-99106,10," Best comedy show I've seen in a long time
","This show is a heartwarming and hilarious
Brilliant writing and how it's set in Ireland during the troubles in the 90s is just very clever and brilliant",/review/rw4677862/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2019,cherold,9," hilarious when I can tell what they're saying
","As an American, I find the accents in Derry Girls fairly impenetrable. I can't make out half of what they say. And yet the other half is so hysterically funny that's it's worth the struggle.",/review/rw4677862/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2018,deepfatfriedoreos,10," Class.
","A thoroughly enjoyable and hilarious addition to channel 4's comedic offerings. The extreme success of 'Derry Girls' lies deeply rooted in the effective well-rounded development of the main and recurring characters. With all four of the Derry Girls being totally antithetical to each other, the show seemingly appeals to a wide and diverse audience without losing sight of its purpose as a comedy. 
Set in 1990s Derry, McGee intricately intertwines the treacherous and realistic political undertones as an effective backdrop to successfully juxtapose the comedic on-goings in the lives of the core characters. It should win lots of awards.",/review/rw4677862/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2019,lee_eisenberg,10," whether funny or serious, there's always a story to tell from an unpleasant part of history
","Lisa McGee's ""Derry Girls"" focuses on some teenage girls in Derry, Northern Ireland, in the 1990s, showing their friendship, education, and antics, all in the context of the Troubles.",/review/rw4677862/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2019,maccas-56367,10," A breath of fresh air
","Imagine if ""The Inbetweeners"" were predominantly girls in 1990s Northern Ireland - that is basically the feel of Derry Girls, though it has an identity all of its own.",/review/rw4677862/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2020,Calicodreamin,9," Cracker
","Some truly hilarious moments, wacky storylines, and an abundance of fun. The cast has great chemistry and comedic timing. The episode storylines are original with a bit of history, which is enjoyable. A real class show.",/review/rw4677862/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2018,Kethina,8," A little nutty but still brilliant
","This was an absolute TREAT. I did not know what to expect when I started watching this but after 2 or 3 scenes, I knew I was gonna binge watch this.
I dont feel like The Troubles is a historical event that has been touched on very often in popular culture. ThatÂ´s why I found it so refreshing to see it in a comedic way through the eyes of Derry teenagers.",/review/rw4677862/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2018,dpoland-76589,10," Hysterical
","So many laughs and much heart, set in an otherwise depressing time in Northern Irish recent history. The last 20 seconds of episode 6 really tied it together as a production. Can't wait for more.",/review/rw4677862/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2021,shanayneigh,8," Pleasantly surprised
","Being a non-Irish man in my 40s I'm clearly not in the key demographic, but I really enjoyed this show. It felt a bit too broad and farcical for my tastes in the beginning, but it got better. The acting is solid throughout. I watched the whole thing in two days and am looking forward to season 3.",/review/rw4677862/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2018,themwallace,10," Plankies and other blasted colonials need not apply...
","But this is #@%&* hilarious!
It's rare for any TV writing to surprise me with originality, and far rarer still for a ""comedy"" show to exhibit enough originality to catch me off guard, but this is a piece of abso-frecking-lute genius!
If you're from the UK of GB & NI, watch it; you'll laugh your @rse off. 
If not, give it a try, and google lots. to try to get where these absolutely brilliant characterisations come from.
I'm actually jealous that someone else wrote this brilliant work!",/review/rw4677862/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2019,PsychoBeard666,10," Flawless comedy

19 March 2020,dhop-44683,10," Brilliant
","I'm a 52 yo Australian bloke and this is only the third review I've ever written. Initially I was scepticalabout a show about teenage girls from Derry, but a mate highly recommended it. To put it simply, this is one of the best series I've seen. The comedy is interlaced with some truly poignant observations and social commentary. Brilliant. Kudos to the Lady who wrote and created this masterpiece.",/review/rw4677862/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2019,jbencker,9," Funny and original
","I usually stay away from shows and films about teenagers because I always get annoyed by the lame teenage drama, but the trailer of Derry Girls made the impression this would not be the usual teenage comedy and I can only agree after watching the show.
There's no endless relationship drama or age-old clichÃ©s but instead the show is about the idiotic things a group of friends gets up to. The characters are original and fresh, each funny in their own way, working very well together. Standing out for me was Siobhan McSweeney as Sister Michael who is just so done with her students; her facial expressions are hilarious.
But what really makes the show special is its setting. Set in the 90s in Northern Ireland it draws on a very specific historical situation (the Northern Ireland conflict) and transforms it brilliantly for comedy.",/review/rw4677862/?ref_=tt_urv
