","There are a lot of movies out there where the leader of a team, talented, strict and know-it-all, tries to discipline his group, in the background of a match or a contest of some sort. Music, sports, army, classes, even spelling contests and of course ...haute cuisine.",/review/rw3387419/?ref_=tt_urv

2 September 2017,xhidden99,5," Oh god another Bradley Cooper damaged genius bad boy movie
",Lemme guess he used to be great but 'threw it all away'. He's on a mission of personal redemption. Every one love hates him. He falls in love with his chief competition who of course hates him and adores him. He's substituted drugs and booze for being a colossal a-hole user of people because he's just that talented. He IS the most interesting man in the world. Before him no one ate food. Other than that this is movie where you hear Bradley speak pretty French where you watch people make and eat pretty good food and there's a lot and I mean a lot of histrionics.,/review/rw3387419/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2015,shbeach,," Ignore the negative reviews
","A must see for those interested in the inner workings of a restaurant kitchen and the world of high end chefs. Most people have no clue what it is like to be at the top of the restaurant world or how difficult it is to be in this type of a service profession. The intense pressure they put on themselves to be ""perfect"". Is the movie a bit disjointed along the way, yes but the acting is stellar and its worth it just to see the food prep and get the overwhelming inside experience. Bradley Cooper is fantastic! Very good supporting actors. Many of them are unknowns. The kitchen scenes are the best. Watching the process and the artistry is a unique peek behind the kitchen doors. Go see this one!!",/review/rw3387419/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2015,neil-476,7," Why are people saying this is a comedy?
","Chef Adam Jones burnt himself out on drink, drugs and sex by way of achieving too much too young and, in so doing, made some enemies and stored up some problems. Now clean, he is seeking to re-establish himself: but does he still have what it takes, because his people skills are sadly lacking.",/review/rw3387419/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2019,schuwomann,4," Predictable and shallow
","The only good thing about this movie is the theme. I love cooking, and I'm a foodie, so obviously the theme appealed to me. Unfortunately, this movie is predictable and shallow. Shame. I won't bother listing all the flaws. If you've seen it then you know what I mean.",/review/rw3387419/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2015,scottshak_111,7," Burnt is fine, but not good, forget about the great ones in the culinary basket.
","John Wells helms a good movie, but he doesn't have a big rad plot to save him. A washed out burnt down Chef has cleaned up, buffed his act up, and put himself together in an endeavour to pursue perfection. He is reaching out for a third Michelin star and anything less would end up getting burnt by his wrath.",/review/rw3387419/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2016,Jazzy31133,6," Visually appetizing, but bland taste
","Movies like burnt are so frustrating to watch and in cases like this, the fault almost always lies with the director and / or meddling producers. I am not 100% sure, but I believe that this script was on the black list and even if it was not it probably was damn good to attract the acting talent to such a project. The acting was well done (no pun intended) and none of the actors mailed in their performance. So why does the sum equal less than the parts?",/review/rw3387419/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2015,Anurag-Shetty,9," Well done, even though the title of the film suggests otherwise.
","Burnt tells the story of a chef named, Adam Jones(Bradley Cooper). During his youth, Adam Jones reached the pinnacle of his cooking career. However, he ruins his career, due to his arrogant behavior & addiction to alcohol & drugs. Adam Jones gets his act together & returns to London. Here, he is determined to redeem himself by taking over a top restaurant & earning three Michelin stars. ",/review/rw3387419/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2015,randymcbeast,3," Bland
",This movie was pretty pointless. It was more about dressing up Bradley Cooper as a Chef and hoping for the best. The story was bland and even the cookery was outdated. A dish that should not have been served.,/review/rw3387419/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2022,udaykumarthambimuthu,8," As a line cook/chef for 11 years, I found it very accurate.
","Preface:
I've spent 11 years of my life in the hospitality industry (in two countries, Australia and Canada), worked my way up from dishwasher/prep cook all the way to head line cook and ultimately sous chef, before finally leaving the industry last month, to do something else with my life.",/review/rw3387419/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2015,burlesonjesse5,8," VIEWS ON FILM review of Burnt
","Burnt (my latest review) is well done. There I said it. Let's get all the puns out of the way shall we. With fast cutting that will make your head spin, close-ups of food that will cause your mouth to water (even though I noshed right before a viewing, I still had a hearty appetite), and a showcase for what I believe to be the best performance of Bradley Cooper's career, this 2015 release is only the third foodie flick I've seen. No Reservations and Chef are the other two and they're mere child's play in comparison.",/review/rw3387419/?ref_=tt_urv

",After just reading that David Fincher was originally supposed to helm the project with Keanu Reeves attached to star I became instantly more ticked off at this movie.

12 September 2016,cullen73,3," Movie Has Been Written A Thousand Times
","""It must be great. Bradley Cooper acts in award winning film."" But no. It's the same movie that every other actor has done at least once in their career. The lead is arrogant, chip on their shoulder, lacks social skills, loner by choice... There is sexual tension with opposite sex (usually) supporting character. This tension helps the lead start to let down their guard. Something happens that upsets the lead so bad they are worse than every before. Then the lead has a mental break down. The opposite sex character helps pick them up. Usually at that same time the sexual tension is broken. The lead makes peace with their demons from the past. Voila!! He/she is no longer an angry prick but a lovable person with great social skills. It all revolves around an unique career, skill or hobby. The only reason to watch the film. In this movie it is world class chef, but it could be a snake milker, innovative uke player or a deep sea crab hunter.",/review/rw3387419/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2016,nando1301-1,2," Badly burned
","A sorry excuse of a film. Awful writing, from the plot to the terrible dialogs. There are so many goofs regarding what a real chef does in a high class kitchen, that you could fill pages with them. Too many inconsistencies, one after another. Examples: a two-star Michelin chef does not ""do everything"" by himself, shouting constantly at all his staff; he does not do the starters, the main courses AND dessert. There are ""sub-chefs"" who specialize in different items.",/review/rw3387419/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2015,alivissianos,9," Amazing!
","Having worked in kitchens i found this incredibly realistic and everything in this film stays true to the life of so many chefs abusing substances and their passion controlling their lives. I'm not normally a fan of Bradley Cooper, however i was amazed to see his acting talents here and how true he was to a real chef. Definitely a game changer for his career after being unimpressed with him in hangover or wedding crashes.",/review/rw3387419/?ref_=tt_urv

4 October 2021,cinemamoviecars,10," more bourdain than the bourdain doc
","This movie feels like bradley cooper is doing his own play on antony bourdain, in fact he make all his behaviour in the movie believable because he plays like he has been all the time this way. Reminds me to bourdain because he ways somethimes over the top, excesive and crazy, and he never denied that.",/review/rw3387419/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2016,CinemaClown,," A Bland, Flavourless & Unsavoury Cuisine!
","An absolutely dry, flavourless & unsavoury meal that exhibits not an ounce of love for culinary arts despite the spectacular looking meals it keeps putting on the screen, Burnt lacks the craft, passion & dedication that goes into creating a great product and is only about an arrogant man's obsession with culinary fame & perfection without ever illustrating his love for what he does.",/review/rw3387419/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2016,SnoopyStyle,6," formulaic but good enough
","Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper) had a meltdown as a two-star Michelin chef in Paris. He was addicted to drugs, alcohol, and women. He burnt down all his bridges, and spent the last couple of years shucking a million oysters in New Orleans. Now clean and sober, he decides to achieve the third star in London. He convinces maître d' Tony to get him started. He recruits many of the old mates and some new ones including sous-chef Helene (Sienna Miller).",/review/rw3387419/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2016,jessemaas93,8," Must see for people who love cooking
","Despite some pretty bad reviews I think it's a pretty strong movie. Especially for people who love to cook of like high-end dining, it's a great movie. Burnt gives an excellent look in the world of high- end dining and professional kitchens. Bradley Cooper puts on a good performance and makes the experience very real. The evolution his character makes may be a little predictable, but I think that's not a bad thing. You should not underestimate the acting skills of Bradley Cooper. The character is written for him in my opinion. Also the character that's played by Daniel Brühl, Tony, is an interesting one and I think that Daniel performs this role outstandingly. Tony is a very proper and tight man, but his character evolves during the movie into a very pleasant one. Brühl makes his character very real with the accent and a particular way he moves in. The plot of the movie may be a little predictable, but that's not a problem. I think all the roles are filled in nicely and all of the characters make the story into a real experience, not only about cooking but also about the difficult world of a Michelin-star restaurant. Summarized I can say this movie is a must-see for people who love cooking and things like that. It's not a mind-blowing story, but in combination with some great acting it makes the movie worth watching. An average of 6,7 is way to low for this movie in my opinion.",/review/rw3387419/?ref_=tt_urv
