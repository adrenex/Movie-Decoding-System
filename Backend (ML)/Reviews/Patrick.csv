24 January 2019,classicsoncall,8," ""A man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a Heaven for?""
","While watching, I had no idea the film was based on a true story. That makes it more interesting in retrospect. Reading some of the trivia notes for the picture here on IMDb, I was intrigued by the fact that the novelist Sir Arthur Conan Doyle based his Professor Challenger character on that of Percy Fawcett. They in fact were good friends, and Doyle was present at the Royal Geographical Society lecture of February 13th, 1911, the one in which Fawcett described his expedition to Huanchaca Plateau in Bolivia. Fawcett's memoirs, which were posthumously published, spoke of the possibility of ""monsters from the dawn of man's existence"", an idea taken to heart by Doyle when he came up with his science-fiction novel titled ""The Lost World"". Quite coincidentally, the silent film version of ""The Lost World"" was released in 1925, the same year Fawcett went missing with his son in The Amazon.",/review/rw3858971/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2017,A_Different_Drummer,7," Unusual Review Notes for an Unusual Movie
","That the movie succeeds is a credit to Hunnam, who comes of age both literally and figuratively in this movie with a performance of great humility, charm, and grit. A far cry from his breakout role as a motorcycle gang leader, and an even further cry from his awkward performance in Guy Ritchie's unique (and hopefully never-to-be-repeated) view of young King Arthur as a slum thug.",/review/rw3858971/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2018,MOscarbradley,9," An art movie more than a conventional adventure epic...and a very fine one.
","Far from a conventional 'jungle adventure' James Gray's outstanding ""The Lost City of Z"" has more in common with the films of Werner Herzog than ""The Mission"". Bases on real events it's the story of explorer Percival Fawcett's search for the lost city of the title deep in the Bolivian jungle. It is a long, slow film more concerned with the psychology of its characters than their actions and it's very well played by Charlie Hunnam, (a revelation), Robert Pattinson and, in a major supporting turn, Angus MacFadyen. It's also stunningly shot by the great Darius Khondji and superbly written and directed by Gray, moving away here from the gritty confines of the American city where we usually find him. It wasn't really a commercial success but then in this day of action superheroes did anyone really think it would be. This is an art movie posing as an adventure epic and doing it very well indeed.",/review/rw3858971/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2019,TreasureHunterGirl,8," A great, enjoyable watch
","I really enjoyed this movie. I didn't know anything about the true story and had not read the book it is based on, so I don't have any complaints about accuracy and I didn't compare it to the book. So from the point of view of a simple movie watcher, it was a great movie.",/review/rw3858971/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2017,subxerogravity,7," Interesting portrait of a man, indeed but as a movie it almost lost me.
","It's one of those labor of loves it seems as the film felt like it was more interested in making an artistic narrative than it was about making money. I can respect that, but it was a boring movie for that reason. ",/review/rw3858971/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2017,ThomasDrufke,6," Where No Man Has Gone Before
","It's very rare in 2017 Hollywood that we get an epic like The Lost City of Z. Albeit noticeably flawed in many aspects, this film hearkens back to the days where exploration epics were a normalcy in the filmmaking world. ",/review/rw3858971/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2018,SnoopyStyle,7," beautiful but meanders
","It's 1905 Ireland. Major Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) with no medals is snubbed for his unfortunate choice of ancestors. He eagerly accepts the Royal Geographical Society's mission to map a river in the amazon to calm the near-warring Bolivia and Brazil. He leaves behind his wife Nina (Sienna Miller) and young children. He is joined by Henry Costin (Robert Pattinson). The group guided by a former slave native finds evidences of civilization in the jungle. Percy returns to ridicule for his claim of a lost city of Z. James Murray (Angus Macfadyen) is one of his few supporters who joins him on the next expedition. Murray turns out to be an incompetent coward who sabotages the quest and demeans him upon return to London. He is dismissed by everyone including his angry son Jack. After being temporarily blinded by a heroic action in WWI, he returns to England vindicated and his son Jack (Tom Holland) convinces him to lead one final quest for his lost amazonian city.",/review/rw3858971/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2020,TonyAtTheMovies,8," Civilisations Lost and Found
","Having not known quite what to expect from this movie - had it been made anytime before 30 years ago that might have been easier - I actually found it fascinating, and it held my attention the whole way through. Based on a true story, it paints a vivid picture not only of the Amazonian region which Percy Fawcett and his men set out to explore, but also of the Western society they came from, but in a fairly balanced way - this didn't feel like another case of 'weren't Western white people before 1980 all absolutely dreadful' but rather a portrayal of a society with its own beliefs and attitudes (as all societies have) faced with the prospect of discovering another, much older, civilisation.",/review/rw3858971/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2019,TheMovieDiorama,8," The Lost City of Z explores the density of obsessive discovery shrouded in a jungle of abandonment.
","Exploration. The yearning for discovery. To set foot where no man has ventured before. To excavate rarities that determine ancient civilisations. There's nothing quite like it. The addiction for reconnoitring. That overwhelming chase for glory in the ambitious overlay of cementing one's name in the history books. During my childhood, I desired to gain such credibility as an explorative scout. The inner Indiana Jones or Rick O'Connell within me, presenting film as a means of inspiration, screaming for adventure. Alas, working behind a desk will have to suffice, as Gray's portrayal of Amazonian fauna and flora proved to be devices for both the dangers of adventure and character self-destruction, in what is the most realistic depiction of exploration presented in film.",/review/rw3858971/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2017,bkoganbing,8," Percy Fawcett 1867-1925?
",No doubt that Percy Fawcett has shuffled off this mortal coil in at least the year 1925. The British explorer and his son vanished in the deep Amazon jungle in that year on a quest to find Fawcett's fabled Lost City Of Z(ed)which is how they would say it across the pond.,/review/rw3858971/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2017,robbierunciman-1,8," Biopic of the end of empire
","I enjoyed the movie - it was a bit paint by numbers but it covered a huge area of his life and his motivations, it was also a story of decline, the derring-do of the British empire and particular type of hero. I think that he has been overlooked because he 'failed' but the film shows how he respected the cultures he found, in contrast to the other members of RGS. The class-based snobbery of the period is also well represented. Highly watchable and recommended.",/review/rw3858971/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2017,pyrocitor,5," Welcome to the Jungle, we got no fun or games
","Percival Fawcett - intrepid explorer, whose exploits into charting the Amazon jungle in search of a mystical ancient civilization captivated the world and inspired a generation of adventure writers - would probably fall asleep during his own dour, flaccid biopic. Now, this isn't to say the only way to cinematically interpret Fawcett's life would be to whip-crack into full-blown Indiana Jones (though a film this allergic to fun could do far worse than shallow, Romancing the Stone mimesis). Instead, director James Gray strives to tap into Fawcett's mythos and mystique with the lyrical, abstract profundity of a Terrence Malick or Werner Herzog (indeed, his telling is irreconcilably indebted to Herzog's own parable of jungle madness, Fitzcarraldo). Sadly, he's too clumsy a director to commit to the kooky poetry of his thematic earmarks. Instead, his lolling sequences of Fawcett's crew wandering through the jungle or circumnavigating stuffy British Geographical Society politics - amazingly, equally drab and aimless - at times pleasantly hypnotic, but threaten to turn proceedings into The Lost City of ZZZzzzzzz.

14 February 2021,kosmasp,8," Lost and Found (not)
","A true story - real characters to portray. Not always something easy to convey. And as the rating shows here not always welcome. Especially if the movie is relatively tough to watch and even tougher to promote. You got quite the interesting cast together - with Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson two ""rivals"" from different comic universes, portraying arguable the most recognizable of each brand. You may disagree with that of course, don't take it personal.",/review/rw3858971/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2020,IreneWatsonC,8," The brave
","The film uses three adventures to show the audience Percy Fawcett's unremitting efforts and persistent pursuit of exploring new worlds. The image of this movie is beautiful. Color selection, contrast between light and dark and picture settings are impeccable. I think that the movie is also telling people that the soul is not necessarily imprisoned forever, and may also soar in accordance with the dream. The movie shows the detachment of the brave but the story is normal.",/review/rw3858971/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2019,shakercoola,6," An enticing quest but without clear narrative focus
","An American biographical adventure; A story about a man who journeys into the Amazon at the dawn of the 20th century and discovers evidence of a previously unknown, advanced civilization that may have once inhabited the region. He was aiming for a city he called 'Z'. It's a film which hearkens back to classic exploration epics of the mid 20th Century. Charlie Hunnam gives a well measured performance as the British geographer, Army Major, and explorer Percy Fawcett. The film centres on passion and determination and obsession and escape but also the losses suffered by leaving the home - his growing family and dutiful wife - in service of fantastical dreams. It is a biopic by numbers and this is a troublesome area because Fawcett and his story have many critics. Nonetheless it is a stately adventure despite the slow pacing.",/review/rw3858971/?ref_=tt_urv

This is NOT Raiders of the Lost Ark.

It moves at a leisurely pace and will not make you sleepy. Unless you're really tired already.
Very well done and acted!

29 March 2017,martin-807-452270,2," Someone managed to make the exploration of the Amazon incredibly dull.
","*****Spoiler Alert**** I was really looking forward to this film, as how can the exploration of the Amazon be anything other than amazing? Well I was wrong, this was utterly boring, excruciatingly dull and just plain awful. I can only give it a 1 out of 5 rating. After the first 30 minutes I was looking at my watch and wondering if I should bother, as I had more important things to do, like clean the oven. How can anyone make the exploration of the Amazon so tedious? This could have been like real life Indiana Jones! There was absolutely no sense of danger at any point, just flat as a very thin pancake. The film should really be re-named The Lost City of Zzzzzzz.",/review/rw3858971/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2017,Horst_In_Translation,6," Great watch for people who are into explorer movies
","""The Lost City of Z"" is an American movie from 2016 and this one is the newest work by writer and director James Gray. This time he did not collaborate with Joaquin Phoenix, but despite being a great Phoenix fan I must say this movie does not need him to be a success. It runs for a really long 2 hours and 20 minutes, but time pretty much flew by and the movie never dragged. This film is about the life and work of British explorer Percy Fawcett played by Charlie Hunnam (""Sons of Anarchy""). I must say I have not come across anything (memorable) by this actor and saw little in him beyond a hunky physicality, but he played his part well here and is one of the main reasons why it all worked out so well. Robert Pattinson (""Twilight"") plays one of the biggest supporting parts and he is surely the biggest name attached to the project. The likes of Sienna Miller, Tom Holland and perhaps Angus Macfadyen will be known to film buffs too though. And I see that western legends Franco Nero has a small part in it too. Shame I did not recognize him.",/review/rw3858971/?ref_=tt_urv

","What a wonderful surprise treat. I had heard this was a good movie but beyond that and the fact that it's based on a true story, I knew next to nothing. Wonderful performances all around, obviously Hunnam is center stage here and he's great but I feel like Pattinson and, to an extent, Holland steal the show.",/review/rw3858971/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2017,diand_,5," Exploitation and exploration
","Based on the true story of British explorer Percy Fawcett, who made several expeditions to the lost city of Z, believed to be the remains of El Dorado in the Brazilian jungle. The movie follows three of these expeditions and first picks up his life with a long introduction from his military career onwards. The movie becomes only interesting with the start of his first map making expedition on the border of Bolivia and Brazil in 1906. Based on documentary and field research (pottery finds), Fawcett became ever more convinced that a complex civilization had existed there. The movie then touches upon a second expedition initiated by the Royal Geographical Society that lead to controversy about his role in that expedition. The first World War comes in between before he makes his last expedition in 1925 with his son.",/review/rw3858971/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2017,drjgardner,2," Should have stayed lost
","It's hard to imagine how this film could be any worse. Let's start with the acting. Charlie Hunnam was great as a m/c thug, but he clearly isn't suited to play a British gentleman at the turn of the 20th Century. His accent comes and goes, but it's his non-verbal behavior that betrays the 21st Century. His co-star Sienna Miller (playing his wife) is wonderful, but the film is almost exclusively Hunnam",/review/rw3858971/?ref_=tt_urv
