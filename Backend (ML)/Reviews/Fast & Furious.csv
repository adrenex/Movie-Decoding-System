18 October 2015,ivo-cobra8,9," Awesome Action fourth installment. Fast & Furious is tremendous!
","Fast & Furious (2009) is an awesome Action packed sequel, where The Fast and the Furious (2001) stopped. This is the real sequel to The Fast and The Furious. I love that Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster reprise their roles back to the roots the way they were. This is my fourth favorite best film in the series, this film Is a seat to the edge from the beginning till the end. This movie kept me thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. Sure it's a little far fetched, but who cares? ",/review/rw2253375/?ref_=tt_urv

",Towards the end of Tokyo Drift (2006) we saw a Vin Diesel returning. People were eager to wait if he really was coming back and he finally did here in number 4. And it do returns to the end of part 2. They only mention Tokyo once at the beginning with Han (Sung Kang) but none of the other actors from that part are here to see except for Han.,/review/rw2253375/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2009,Robert_duder,7," Oh right we forgot the epilogue....all Furious but lacking fast...
","So what is Fast and Furious? It's not a remake, or a reboot, and although it would appear to be a sequel it really is ultimately a recap to the very first film...or the second I forget. It has been so long since I've seen the original two films which this one is a direct follow up to. I kind of wish I had watched the first two before seeing this because it may have helped with the overall characters and plot. They do still try to link together not just the first two films but all the movies which I give them kudos for because I actually thoroughly enjoyed Tokyo Drift. So here comes Fast and Furious, barely changing the title from the first one but bringing back the original cast that defined the series. The thing that caught me the most about this film is it is not about car racing anymore. Really the film is about drug trafficking and despite a huge car/truck stunt in the first scene Fast and Furious lacks much of anything fast at all. All the other installments of the series have focused on the cars and the sexy sleek speed of everything but Fast and Furious tries to turn that around by giving it a different edge.",/review/rw2253375/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2010,g-bodyl,9," Can't Wait for the Fifth!
",Fast and Furious is another great addition to the already great series of these movies. This movie picks up after 2 Fast 2 Furious which came out six years before this. I am really happy to see the original cast back in the film. These four people are what made this series successful(at least the first one).,/review/rw2253375/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2009,C-Younkin,7," Still fast, still furious
","Fast and Furious, or 4 Fast 4 Furious if you're keeping count, is a movie you can basically sum up in one sentence. Muscle guys, muscle cars, hot chicks, and incredible action sequences. Not much has changed in the four films other than who the muscle guys wind up being played by but nonetheless, if you're going to the movies strictly to continually watch these things, then not only will this series run forever, but you should have no problem sitting through this fourth flick. Of course the other thing to look at here is the resurrection of Vin Diesel's action star persona, and considering he's been doing movies like ""Babylon AD"" and ""The Pacifier"" for the past couple years, you can basically say this is one of his better performances in a real long time.",/review/rw2253375/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2014,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,7," Original cast, different story
","After two films that strayed away from the very first that made the franchise popular, producers to The Fast and the Furious (2001) decided to finally bring back the original cast and big name stars. That was one of their best decisions that have been made. It's baffling to why they thought changing the cast would really benefit them in any way. All it does is create resent and a disconnect with the new characters. Fans don't appreciate that. However, this is not the only difference brought to this ongoing series. The original cast returns but the story changes. Oh yes, there's still an abundance racing cars but it's for a different reason.",/review/rw2253375/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is one of these 107-minute testosterone movies guys crave every once in awhile, some more than others. Being a somewhat-old guy, I don't look as these as often anymore but every once in awhile it's fun to kick back and just watch fast cars, loose women, wild action and fairly-brainless film.",/review/rw2253375/?ref_=tt_urv

","i thought this prequel to Tokyo Drift was actually not bad.it starts off with a real adrenaline rush.the racing scenes are pretty good,as are the chase scenes.the story was good,and flowed well.there are quite a few dramatic moments in this film and they all work well.most of the original actors form the first film in the series are back,including Vin Diesel,Jordana Brewster Michele Rodriguez,and Paul Walker.i don't think it was as good as the first film,but it was a close second.i added it to my collection,and don't regret it.if you're a fan of the series,you should like this one.for me,Fast & Furious is a well deserved 7/10",/review/rw2253375/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2015,taylorkingston,10," An awesome kind-of reboot to the franchise...
","I was honestly so happy when this movie happened. I am a huge fan of The Fast And The Furious, and sadly, 2 Fast 2 Furious and The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift, did not meet my expectations. I just thought they changed too much. This movie brings everyone back, and the story goes back to where it was born and where it made fans love the sport of drag racing even more.

26 July 2019,masonsaul,6," Fun but familiar
","Once again, it follows the same plot points as some of the previous installments but Fast and Furious is still fun and its beginning to embrace the ridiculousness. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker give great performances and it's nice to see them back in the same film. John Ortiz is a really good villain. The action and car chases are also really good as usual.",/review/rw2253375/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2013,Bruce722,9," Great movie.
","Fast and Furious was a very good movie that had a darker and more serious tone than any of the prior films in the franchise. I loved seeing almost the entire original cast return and the amazing cars and impressive special effects that are a staple of the series return once again... granted, with a reduced emphasis on the cars themselves. The only real problem I had was that the continuity was broken a bit. *SPOILERS* Why, for example, is Paul Walker back in LA after the ending of 2 Fast 2 Furious? What happened to Tyrese's character? What happened to the rest of the crew from the original movie? These are not huge complaints but they did take away from the experience a bit. It's also evident that this film is a prequel to Tokyo Drift which was a little weird. Nonetheless, great film that is probably better than any of the prior ones other than the first of course.",/review/rw2253375/?ref_=tt_urv

","with these movies coming out to the theatre every other year now, and now I just looked on this site fast n furious 7 2014. I need to catch up with the series. Paul Walker returns with Vin Diesel along with Michelle rodriguez for #4. there are a lot more bad guys in this film I thought the idea of the Mexican drug cartel presented a few new ideas. there is lot's of action to be had here, the gasoline tanker's explosion,, the chases with all of the cars in the Mexican tunnels, with the chopper in pursuit of all of the vehicles. I like the idea of using the border as a character in the movie. because apparently you can only be tracked for so long either before or after you get across the border, I forget how that works. but there is lot's of good one liners in here for our characters to chew up, love all of the fast cars and the faster women,, although I wonder how many of these movies can they keep making,, don't get me wrong I like them very much, but at some point you have to sit back and say , I think we need something else.",/review/rw2253375/?ref_=tt_urv

","Brian O'Conner is now working for the FBI on a thin leash, with no room for error. When Dom finds out that Letty was murdered, he sets all his morals aside to catch the people responsible. Not only that, but Dom is forced to accept help from the man who betrayed his trust, Brian O'Conner. I've seen this movie three times now, and it never fails to entertain me. After two sequels that weren't up to par with the first movie, they went all out to make sure this franchise was back on track. What better way to revitalize the series than with the return of Vin Diesel. He had a brief cameo at the end of Tokyo Drift, but this was his first movie since the first. I wouldn't call the plot fantastic or anything, but it definitely has more story to it than usual (IMO).The stakes are much higher emotionally. There are some legitimately good twists and turns in this movie as well. But we all know why we watch these movies, the action. Let me just say that they won't disappoint you. There are some exhilarating action sequences in this movie that don't give you time to breath. The opening scene is spectacular and the finale is excellent as well. It keeps the formula of fast cars, hot women, hunky guys, and rap music. I do have to say the action looked far more professional, continuing this trend in 5 & 6. My only carp about the action, is some shaky camera work at times. This is especially noticeable during an exciting foot race between Walker and a criminal. The performances won't win any Oscars, but they are a lot of fun to watch. Paul Walker's maturity shows as an actor at this juncture. He always had presence, but his performance is rock solid in this one. Vin Diesel isn't that great at emotion. He doesn't really do much when it comes to Letty's death like he should have, but he has plenty of charisma and screen presence. It was fun to see him paired with Walker once again. That p******s called Corona that you drink has gotta go though, bro. Craft beer is much tastier. Jordana Brewster does fine with what she had to do, but I felt her storyline with Walker wasn't explored enough. Michelle Rodriguez plays her part adequately as Letty. She had a jail term to serve, so I imagine that's why she was killed off. The villains are pretty weak in this one. They weren't that menacing in my opinion. The ending does a great job of jerking emotions from you. I have to give it credit",/review/rw2253375/?ref_=tt_urv

17 June 2013,lesleyharris30,8," Takes The Fhranchise Back To Where It Belongs,
","Fast And Furious is a great movie with a well developed storyline that takes the Fast and the Furious franchise back to where it belongs.They clearly realize that these movies are better off with the same people,in the second one it was only Paul Walker with a main role and in the third the cast is completely different.I found this one much better,even better than the first in my opinion,it seems more mature and focuses more on a good story rather than just good car chases,don't worry though,there's plenty of time for that as well.Clearly the Fast and Furious movies can only continue with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker,and from this one forward they realize that,and the fifth only improves.Fans of the first Fast and Furious will be very pleased with this installment.",/review/rw2253375/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2011,zardoz-13,8," Fast & Furious But Anti-Climactic
","High-octane driving, treacherous villains, challenging predicaments and life and death stakes fuel the fourth entry in ""The Fast and the Furious"" film franchise. This fast-wheels and sexy-sirens series spun out of control after the Dom-less sophomore entry ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" then regained momentary traction with ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift."" Nevertheless, the third escapade lacked Dom and Brian but held up strictly because it was fresher than the second one. Life is back in the right land and hings careening into the home stretch with ""Fast & Furious."" Brawny Vin Diesel is back full-time in this one after a cameo in the previous outing. Paul Walker reprises his role as FBI Agent Brian O'Connor who is as smooth with his lies as he is with his cars. Indeed, two other originals encore, principally Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster. The chief problems with ""Fast & Furious"" are its formula sequelitis and its unbelievable storytelling. Like most standard sequels, one of the originals has to bite the dust to keep things exciting and this time around it is bad girl Michelle, but she goes out for a good cause. You don't expect a ""Fast and Furious"" movie to be credible, but the use of the caves as a smuggler's highway through mountains stretches things to blow-out point. The way that the drivers haul booty through these claustrophobic spaces may be hair-raising as hell but it is also terribly unrealistic. Like the previous entry, director Justin Lin and scenarist Chris Morgan strut their best stuff during the first 30 minutes while the last quarter hour suffers. The ending will leave you looking fora fifth sequel. This is the first time that Dom and Brian, who were pitted against each other in ""The Fast and the Furious,"" square off again and Morgan answers the question as to why the FBI guy let the gearhead go.",/review/rw2253375/?ref_=tt_urv

So much nostalgia! Seeing Vin, Paul, Michelle, and Jordana together again was fantastic! You can tell that these characters have grown since the first film. Brian is working on a case with the FBI that brings him in collision with Dom, who is back in the states seeking revenge for the murder of his gal Letty. This entry is definitely a bit heavy compared to the first few but that doesn't mean there isn't fun to be had! The opening sequence and the race at the middle of the film are two highlights! The tunnel sequences were not as good though, CGI being one of the reasons- still enjoyed it though! ",/review/rw2253375/?ref_=tt_urv
