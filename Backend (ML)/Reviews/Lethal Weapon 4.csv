",I regret watching this movie at home and not at the movie theater. these kind of movies are much more enjoyable specially on the big screen. The movie has a magic to it and atmosphere that is very well portrayed.,/review/rw2628109/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2020,bowmanblue,7," Way better than it should be
",Sometimes a film has everything going for it on paper and yet somehow manages to mess itself up. 'The Warrior's Way' is actually the opposite. Nothing really should work here and yet it all falls together to make a highly-watchable film.,/review/rw2628109/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2018,nogodnomasters,9," All THAT YOU LOVE, YOU DESTROY
","A man is raised to be the strongest warrior in the history of world- ever. He is a member of the Sad Flutes clan, which gets its name from the sound of a throat being cut. He has killed all the members of a rival clan, except one, an infant girl. He cares for her and in doing so becomes the enemy of his clan, who try to kill him (and her.) Our warrior flees to American and ends up in a surreal looking town, located in the desert, occupied by circus people. They adopt him as one of their own. He is befriended by a black midget who reminded me a little of Captain Spaulding. A redheaded girl helps our warrior and becomes his student.",/review/rw2628109/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2014,Woonerism,10," Bravo!
","Never ceases to amaze me how a movie can move an audience in polar opposite ways. It's probably the expectations - so if you go in to have some escapist fun, action and swordplay, you won't be disappointed.",/review/rw2628109/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2011,perkypops,10," Brilliant in every way
","This is a superb work of art from the moment it starts to the moment it finishes. It is stylish, theatrical when the dramatic content demands it, beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, terrific story telling, great action pieces, and, most importantly, entertaining.",/review/rw2628109/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2013,LloydBayer,6," Stylized action flick that doesn't take itself too seriously.
","Debutant director and screen writer Sngmoo Lee took a big gamble with this one, as you will see why. In an almost Quintin Tarantino styled narration, the prologue introduces us to Yang (Jang Dong-Gun) and his mission to become 'The World's Greatest SwordsmanEver'. He does so, within the first five minutes of the movie, by vanquishing an entire enemy clan; all but onean infant princess. Rather than thrusting his Samurai sword through the toddler, Yang has a change of heart and decides to head West, because sooner or later, his own clan will hunt him down for not finishing the job. Arriving at a desolate town rife with down and out circus freaks, Yang finds work in an old Laundromat. Before long, he befriends 8-Ball, a wise cracking midget (Tony Cox), Ron, a hopeless drunk (Geoffrey Rush) and the sassy knife throwing Lynne (Kate Bosworth). With the infant in safe custody, Yang learns of Ron and Lynne's tragic past. An ex-bank robber, Ron laid down his guns at the wish of his dying wife. Lynne on the other hand, watched her family brutally murdered by an outlaw called 'Colonel'. Even as Yang blends in with the town folk, he realizes that a storm is approaching; a storm dark enough to wipe out the entire town. ",/review/rw2628109/?ref_=tt_urv

3 December 2010,cafesmitty,6," Entertaining, Stylish, not much Substance
","I am one that love stylish movies, especially action movies and I was hoping for a little more out of this. To be honest, the story is a bit lacking, but the action is very cool. There are some scenes which play more than others. The main character hardly ever talks and its really noticeable. I love Kate Bosworth in this movie, she is a saving grace to this film. I can't put my finger on it, but it is missing something. Its missing that ""awe"" moment that I was hoping it would deliver. You know, that scene that would make your mouth drop and I was expecting it from this movie. It was just too slow. And the writing is off. It is just not quite there. The pace of the film is off also. Still, entertaining as hell, but don't waste your money on seeing in that XD format (which stands for eXtreme Digital). That just a waste of some extra bucks. There is nothing more you are going to gain watching it in even, supposedly, higher def than what theaters normally do. But the movie is very stylish. Its the latest movie of mixing two genres,ninjas and westerns. And I give it a 7 out of 10, it did its job of entertaining. Btw, not a family movie and definitely not for small kids. I think guys will like it more than women. It is worth going to the theater to see. It is not worth a blind buy on blu-ray when it comes out. It is worth buying on blu-ray if you are into it and have seen the movie. But I would go out with your buddies, don't expect much and you will get more.",/review/rw2628109/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2010,paperback_wizard,7," The Warrior's Way - What Works
","Jang Dong Gun, the South Korean movie star who's known for far more than martial arts, has made his American blockbuster debut in ""The Warrior's Way"", a film about the greatest swordsman in the world who is forced to flee his home. While not precisely a science fiction movie, there are just enough fantastical elements in this Old Western-style action flick to make it into the genre without crossing over into the highly volatile ""Sci-fi Western"" category. And that definitely works for this movie. Here are some other things that work, and that don't work.",/review/rw2628109/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2011,tedg,," Edges
","I rushed to see this on the big screen because I expect it to go away quickly. This is another movie where the watching is itself not rewarding; the reward is in the awareness of sharing the experience of a risky, somewhat twisted experience. ",/review/rw2628109/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am so late in watching this movie - had never heard of it before - but I came across the trailer of it in you-tube last night and had to watch it. This movie has a great balance between cowboy/samurai - great character development, great story telling, very good actors (some were over the top but in a good way), and some of the best choreography that I have seen in a very long time. And the music score was very well played in the background bringing just the right tone to every scene.",/review/rw2628109/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2020,paulclaassen,6," A hell of a lot of fun!
","This English-language Korean film certainly is pleasing to the eye. It is visually stunning with great photography. Unconventional and a bit weird also comes to mind, but oh-so enjoyable and a lot of fun (despite some slapstick humor).",/review/rw2628109/?ref_=tt_urv

",This is just what it is: an out and out fun film for those who liked anything from Highlander to Wanted and the Tournament or a ton of other films with blades and assassins. It is well-made with high production values with plenty of creativity in the camera work for both bullets and swords and all in all has great production values.,/review/rw2628109/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2020,MovieIQTest,," A fantastic poem written in blood
","This film has achieved the ultimate goal of montage with all the appropriate ingredients that a motion picture should have done long time ago. The only drawback is Ti Lung's distorted out-of-portion ugly old face. A once so handsome actor who you would never understand how Life could treat him so harshly. The Korean actor, Dong-Gun Jang, is the best choice and cast for this film as he was in the similar Wu Ji (2005) or modern day thriller, U-neun nam-ja (2014), Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo (2004), or Mai wei (2011), an absolutely talented and most serious cool dude from Korea.",/review/rw2628109/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2010,zardoz-13,9," A Slashing Chop-Socky Shoot'em Up with Ningas and Outlaws Galore!!!
","Freshman writer & director Sngmoo Lee pays tribute to those East-meets-West horse opera/samurai adventure epics from the 1970s with ""The Warrior's Way,"" a synthesis of vintage Shaw Brother martial arts sagas and violent Spaghetti westerns. The 1970s saw a number of these oddball oaters where coiffed swordsmen and kung fu masters teamed up with swift-shooting gunslingers. Some of these memorable mash-ups with Asian warriors and frontier ruffians were Terence Young's ""Red Sun"" (1971) co-starring Charles Bronson and Toshiro Mifune; Antonio Margheriti's ""The Stranger and the Gunfighter"" (1974) with Lee Van Cleef and Lieh Lo; Mario Caiano's ""The Fighting Fists of Shanghai Joe"" (1974) with Klaus Kinski and Chen Lee, and Sergio Corbucci's ""Shoot First . . . Ask Questions Later"" (1975) Eli Wallach and Tomas Milian. Contemporary audiences probably remember Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson in Tom Dey's ""Shanghai Noon"" (2000) and Takashi Miike's more recent ""Sukiyaki Western Django"" (2007) with Quentin Tarantino and Hideaki Itô. Lee's saga teems with gravity-defying ninjas that materialize magically out of thin-air and hordes of plug-ugly gunslingers who look like they are taking a siesta from the ""Mad Max"" movies.",/review/rw2628109/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2010,gamergamer01,10," Move over pirates, because it's cowboys vs. ninja time!
","The concept in itself sounds cool. Assassins from the east battle against cowboys from the west. With The Warrior's Way, we get the best of both worlds with likable characters, especially the little baby. The setting of the movie is very stylized, and brings you a very romanticized western. The same can be said about the eastern setting. You can tell that the director loves Sergio Leone and Akira Kurosawa movies. ",/review/rw2628109/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2010,AsianTalentHollywood,4," Rude Awakening
","This film is such a mixed bag it is difficult to know where to begin. The filmmakers decided that everything would be on set and filmed with a green screen which lends itself to a dark and visually exciting look, however, the downside of so much emphasis on visual effects is that it transforms the film into a quasi unbelievable fantasy land. In essence it sucks the life out of all the characters and makes it look like some animated video game. The town is a bizarre circus, literally not figuratively, that makes no sense especially since they just hang around in circus outfits all the time. To make matters worse, you have all these characters plopped in a town that is a small street of run-down, mostly uninhabited buildings with no homes for any of the townspeople, huh? What a mess. That said, if you are looking for beautiful cinematography (visual effects of course) as the backdrop for a martial arts film with some great fight scenes, then not all is lost...well sorta.",/review/rw2628109/?ref_=tt_urv
