11 December 2022,Orby2283,5," As a fan of the franchise, was underwhelmed.
","Big fan of the Dragon Age franchise. The strength of Dragon Age has always been its characters as in they usually carry their games, from Alistair to Morrigan, from Avaline to Varric to Blackwall to Viviane every game just has strong interesting diverse characters and that's what always keep me hung on.",/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2022,allmartyrs,3," Bad Dragon (Age)
","If you like the abandoned script of a game crammed into about 2 hours with flat, one sided characters and video game combat, you'll like it. If you liked Bioware for having developed characters and good dialogue, you won't find them here.",/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2022,mfeierskov,6," Pretty good, but not that memorable
","Another decent game anime on Netflix. It's certainly not up there with Arcane, but it's not bad either.",/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2022,Yugeshan,2," Not Dragon
","I've played every Bioware game since the 90s including the Dragon Age titles and believe me, this is not Dragon Age. This is a generic medieval animated title just using the license. There is a fair amount of social politics integrated here and the aim of the show isnt to further the lore and characters of the source material. Instead it is poorly written and animated. There are far better animated shows you can watch than this, especially if you are a Bioware or Dragon Age fan. I seriously doubt if the original writers or creators had any part in this save for a mention in the credits which is sad to see.",/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,tsykul,4," Shallow knock off with unlikeable characters, but good animation
",4 / 10 for me.,/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2022,rdamian1963,3," Misses the mark
","What could have been a very interesting and entertaining animated series falls short of mediocrity. Its full of political correctness and diversity for the sake of diversity. This detracts from what little character development there is. The limited number of episodes keeps the story from being fully developed and prevents an adequate telling of character back stories. Its attempts at being whimsical fall flat. Overall animation quality is marginal. The story line is likeable but with all the fore mentioned, the series just was disappointing. So, I'm sure they will continue the saga and continue rolling out political correctness ad nausea.",/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,Nob0dy,2," Dragon age: The pandering chronicles
","Have you ever played the dragon age games and thought that the fantasy was too interesting, that characters too well written. Have you ever played through the games and though they were too exciting or interesting? If so maybe you will like this show, because I do not know what other target demographic it could possibly be for.",/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2022,skkyprincess,2," I love the Dragon Age games & novels but....
","This show was mediocre, at best. I think the main thing that ruined it for me was Mariam, the main character. I found her to be really unlikable, and when her backstory is revealed, it really did little for me. It was underwhelming. It was a mix if recycled storylines that had been done much better before. I think they were trying to make Mariam a female version of Fenris, but it just did not work for me at all.",/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2022,interastral,4," Pretty childish LARP as a Cartoon.
","Epic fantasy this is not. While Dragon Age: Absolution has some redeeming qualities, such as being fairly inoffensive, and an honest attempt at telling a fantasy adventure, for me it ultimately falls flat, and here's why:",/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2022,tsibosp,3," Good for nothing
","So this adventurers party consists of 6 characters. The only one who is remotely explored is the main character. The party consists of 2 gay females, 2 gay males, a female we don't know anything about and a male who turns out to be a traitor and that's pretty much it. It only has 6 episodes that are not nearly enough to cover the barebones main plot but somehow there was just enough time to also explore the characters sexuality, which doesn't affect the plot in absolutely no way, and nothing else. Being gay is NOT character development. No one cares anymore.",/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2022,eclipsetim,5," Not sure yet, bland, drops you into the mix without any guidance.
",Its something to watch sorta related to dragon age. Thats about all i can say.,/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2022,Cayalle,1," Not made for fans
","Firstly this was not made for those who really like dragon age, the series clearly lacks development precisely because it is short. We know that dragon age comes from Bioware, a master in character and plot development... Something we don't see in this series. The series itself is weak, poorly written and full of unnecessary plot twists. The characters are silly and childish, many say something, but act contrary to what was said earlier. Tevinter is a city that literally has no mages, I found that pretty weak. As the series is short, everything ends up being rushed and part of that is what ruins the series. The protagonist is totally annoying and without charisma, a former slave who refuses to save a slave child... I don't think I need to say anything more than that. Other than that, the protagonist is totally silly and sunk in a toxic relationship of manipulation... The villain is a troubled slave owner who sees reality with a crooked eye, not to mention bad writing. Of the secondary characters (who are even fun) only the Qunari is saved, but... She is a writing error, because we know that the Qunaris hunt magicians of their own race... So to complement, the series seems to be an attempt of fan service, clearly a fan fiction, that is, bad. They even make an attempt at promotion on top of the game to come, which will be in tevinter by all indications. Series note 1/10. Sorry for any language mistakes, English is not my native language.",/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,angelbites2000,1," A tacky Tumblr fanfic
","As a fan of the Dragon Age videogame series I was very dissappointed because the series didn't really bring justice to the complexity of the characters in the games. Instead, the series felt like watching a cartoon based on a 15-year old's homoerotic fanfiction story. The romantic relationships between the characters seemed very forced and random, and the screen time just could have been used in other things, like making the actual plot more interesting. The series would probably be quite difficult to follow for someone new to the series so maybe there could have been more time for introducing the setup of the story.",/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2022,poetictank,4," Vox Machina but bad
","As an avid fan of the franchise, I was looking forward to this series adaptation. The character development and storytelling are horrible. The show is so muddy. The first three episodes are extremely difficult to get through because you can see how the show is trying to rip-off of the likes of Vox Machina in terms of character personalities and stylistic dynamics. However, the show falls short.",/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2022,BijeshNagesh,7," As Nostalgic As It Was Impressive - S01 Review
","First Impressions:
Since it was the show's first season, I made an effort not to compare it too much with the richly intricate worlds in the ""Dragon Age"" games that inspired it. Regardless, watching this series made me nostalgic for the games.",/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,lelama,5," Not bad, but not good either
","While I enjoy the thedas-setting, the show itself feels very ""generic"". Obviously this isn't a project to the level of Arcane, but I was hoping it could contend with the likes of edgerunners or the legend of vox machina, but sadly... It is just lacking in every regard. Everything is ""okay"" but nothing except maybe the voice acting stands out. The main characters are one-dimensional, with the main character just always being so powerful and almost flawless that it's boring, while the rest of the gang gets very little to contribute outside their party-role.",/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2022,renanananias,1," Dragon Age game is good, the animation was bad
","I gave it a chance and advanced on the boring and irrelevant parts of something medieval ""since they seem like they just wanted to mimimi"", so in short, weak story, even worse plot, lots of plot holes, and a villain that was very politically forced, the villain taking the part of the slave owner had better motives than the group of protagonists, that was before they forced him to stop considering the elf as a sister, which was really forced in the story, and honestly the dragon age creators must have been grateful just with the money received , because of the rest, from bad to worse, apart from the forced powercreep, as if a group of thieves focused on all lv100, and both dem*ns and the royal guards were all lv 5 at max ""apart from the villain and the main guard""!!! What's the use of having good traits if everything else is horrible!!!",/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv

",I've been a fan of DA universe since Origins was a new thing on the block. To be honest with you all I went into this expecting to hate it. Netflix has disappointed me more times than it pleased me statistically.,/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,danigaillard,10," Unexpected treasure
","The first two episodes were more cheesy-entertaining. They're not bad, but they are filled with lots of fantasy tropes, cliches, and overused one liners. But still a solid, simple amusement. Which IMO, is what made the final 4 episodes all ten out of tens. The unexpected takeoff of plot, character development, twists and intrigue. I binged in an afternoon.",/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2022,jalib-66193,2," Insult to the franchise
","This is nothing more than an insult to the franchise. The story is poor, the pacing is awful, nothing that happens is given any context so nothing has any immersion and no events have any impact. Despite there being 14 years worth of history and lore already well established and well loved, this manages to be the most surface level and generic fantasy cration currently on any streaming platform.",/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,kindredvillain,9," Loved it!
","Been a huge Dragon Age fan and wasn't too sure about this, was afraid Netflix would mess it up somehow. Ended up absolutely loving it though! It was pretty great. Loved the characters and their dynamics (could of used a bit more character development in some areas though). Loved all of the references to the Dragon Age games. Enjoyed the setting of Tevinter and seeing a bit about the lives of those whom live there. Had plenty of twists and turns, some I saw coming and some that I really didn't! The story was pretty great as well and definitely peaked my interest. This absolutely left me wanting to see more. I need to see where this story goes and what happens with it!",/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2022,scarletnikol,9," As a dragon age fan i approve!!!
","While i think there should be a bit more character development and the story to be a little bit more slow-paced, the episode limit the writers had made it impossible to achieve, you can only fit in that much story in a 1hour and 40 minutes series. But the characters are likeable and have their own personality, the animation is really good, i love how there are dark themes but also light, giving the show a good balance and lastly the fight scenes are intense and brutal. So all in all for a mini series the story is pretty good! I also really loved the cameos from characters from the games. This series is a good addition to the dragon age universe and i would like to see more! And preferably a longer story the next time.",/review/rw8730509/?ref_=tt_urv
