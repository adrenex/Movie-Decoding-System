19 March 2022,ferguson-6,6," not as clever as hoped
","SXSW 2020
Greetings again from the darkness. Expectations were sky high for the latest from writer-director Jeff Baena. His twisted humor was evident in THE LITTLE HOURS (2017), and he has collaborated again with his HORSE GIRL (2020) co-writer Alison Brie, who also takes the lead role. The assembled cast is filled to the brim with folks who have proven comedy chops, and much of the film takes place in gorgeous Italy. What could go wrong? Well, technically nothing goes wrong, it's just not as right as we hoped.",/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv

19 August 2022,bangel3322,2," Not sure what the point of this film is
",This film was quite weak. It had very flaccid storytelling. There was no point or substance to it. That can be overlooked in comedy at times but it wasn't funny enough to rely on laughs alone. Then it just ended quite abruptly. All in all it was quite a waste of time really. Alison Brie is better than this.,/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,cekadah,1," WTF creepy movie
",Here are a few names of the cast in this movie -,/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,grelana,5," Did they make the plot up as they went along?
","Near to the end, the Alison Brie character says ""WTF is going on?"" and most viewers will have asked the same thing about an hour earlier. The film starts off fairly predictably but once the action moves to Tuscany, no-one, except the above mentioned character, behaves like normal people behave. And not in a funny, zany-comedy way, they simply become progressively more weird.",/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2022,A_Different_Drummer,5," Alison Brie...
",".. who is both the co-writer and the star (!), has at least one great film in her. But this is definitely not it. This script is however remarkable for setting up so many interesting possibilities and then delivering on none of them. The end result is maybe a 10 min SNL skit, not a full length film. And it was particularly unwise to cast Plaza in a secondary role, because her natural charisma immediately has the viewer wondering why she is not starring?",/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,ryrymadrid,1," Dumpster Fire
","What a bore! I assumed this was supposed to be a comedy or something, but there was no jokes!?!! Characters are flat and lifeless. Seemed like no one wanted to be in this movie. This looked liked one of those forgettable films that pop up on one of those no name streaming services that nobody has. How does this director keep getting funding for his terrible dumb boring movies???",/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,roxlerookie,5," When a bunch of friends decide to make a movie together
","This was disappointing. It felt pretty long / poorly edited, it wasn't snappy, it was rarely funny, it was often awkward, it just feels like the script wasn't good enough, the story isn't good enough, and I'm a fan of the absurd and the two female leads. But this was just weak, aimless, and ultimately frustrating.",/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,mysay-97-581086,8," It's a satire spoof at all Harlequin romances
",OMG if you couldn't figure out the all the cracks at the rom com scenarios then you really haven't watched enough of them. I laughed constantly how completely silly this movie was.,/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,pkpera,5," Most laughable was to calling this comedy
","And most appropriate description is probably: spinning around the viewer . Almost that I wanted to finish with it this my review ... What would be again appr. Considering how movie self finished :-)
Note: there will be 2 Italian words in following text. I'm sure everyone will get them even without translator.",/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,jdesando,," Light comedy with a hint of satire perfect for end of summer.
","In the lightest and sometimes strangest comedy of the year, Spin Me Round, a manager of Italian Grille (think Olive Garden), Amber (Alison Brie), wins a trip to a corporate immersion program in Italy, enthusiastic about vacating her humdrum life in Bakersfield, Ca. Other winner managers of varying eccentricities are played by top-drawer comic actors Tim Heidecker, Debby Ryan, Zach Woods, Ayden Mayeri, and Molly Shannon.",/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2022,paiello-44319,1," UNWATCHABLE!!
",I can count on one hand the number of bad movies I have walked out of or turned off. I usually persevere just to see the entire story. Add this one to the one hand list. Max we could stand it was thirty minutes.,/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,doujyr,6," Kept me guessing
","Fun film, kept going down different avenues so I wasn't quite sure what was happening. Was it a simple romance? Find out she's really a lesbian? Slasher movie? Sex trafficking and slavery? All the various tropes hinted at, really well done I thought. And in the end it turned out to be .......",/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2022,imseeg,6," Half good, other half is kinda tedious...
","Silly story about an average, middle aged woman who wins a prize for her excellent manager work and gets to go to Italy on a holiday to meet her Italian boss in an ydillic place. So she thinks. But soon this supposedly prize holiday seems to be nothing else but a tedious training week with a lustful boss who wants to sleep with her.",/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,PatriceLeGraisseux,1," pointless and poorly executed at that
","There's got to be another reason why this movie got made. Aubrey plaza and molly shannon have both been talking, bragging almost, about how they filmed in italy and took their families with them and whatnot. 70% is filmed inside a bleak poorly lit office space. This isn't a movie - it's a tax cut. Also wtf is pino donaggio doing here?",/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,jandersh-1,4," I'm not really sure what the movie is trying to be
","After watching, I have little idea of what the movie was trying to do. About the only takeaway I had was the feeling that I had just wasted my time. The plot was not particularly interesting and for the most part didn't make a lot of sense. I guess the film was attempting to be a comedy, but it just wasn't funny enough to justify that classification. Alison Brie's presence raised my rating by 2-3 stars, but other than her there wasn't much about the movie I can recommend.",/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,caroline_chupaa,7," Pretty cool and quirky
","Huge Alison Brie fan, and she was absolutely fantastic in this film! Was hoping to see more of Audrey Plaza and not to mention - that I was hoping they'd have a run into each other in the end.",/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,FKDZ,4," Spin Me Round
","Even as a run of the mill rom com this is sub par. It tries to be somewhat different and that aspect only really shines at the end, but everything else is mediocre to bad.",/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2022,Sulan2,1," Absolute garbage, save yourself the time
",I thought this would be a funny comedy movie but it just a wierd wannabe horror bad and over used sex jokes movie that I cant even belive was made.,/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,stevelivesey67,3," Absolute nonsense. A plot made up as they went along.
","Pretty awful. Starts off as a rom com, segues into a conspiracy thriller and then into farce finishing off as a rom com. Absolute batshyt craziness.",/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2022,julian-640-544058,1," Moviegoers deserve much better then this.
",I watched this 'thing' because it was billed a comedy and with Molly Shannon and Alison Brie I figured it could be entertaining.,/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2022,REDJunior,1," What ...
","... an absolute waste of resources ... utter garbage ... with no plot ... no message ... nothing to redeem itself in any way whatsoever. The only thing that ""Spin Me Round"" can say for itself is that it finally answers the question of whether or not Fred Armisen and Molly Shannon have any relevance left at all. That answer is ""no"".",/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2022,virgonoshaka,7," I did want to love it more, like Alison Brie's character
","First of all the cast was so promising : Fred Armisen, Ego Nwodim, Alison Brie, Ben Sinclair, Aubrey Plaza and Zach Woods. Instant interest only by reading the cast.",/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,wirednights,7," Zany characters make for a charming & polarizing film
","The characters are all flawed, making them more believable. Molly Shannon's character doesn't know how to act her age. Alessandro Nivola's character seems like a sleaze-ball, but his trauma could excuse his emotional incontinence. Tim Heidecker's character is the self aggrandizing a-hole with snarky jokes. Aubrey Plaza's character is the wild card. The interactions between characters are well-written, well-performed and believable.",/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,FilmWatcher2222,7," Spin Me Round
","I enjoyed this movie because the unexpected didn't hit like plot twists they wisely transitioned from one thing to another which kept you guessing. You didn't understand how it would end. I think this is an important film for women to realise their strong and wise enough to stand on their own two feet even when temptation tries to lead them astray. That's in essence the theme, for one to not settle for someone even though their love is presented as a Ferrari but has the insides of a tour bus... pun intended. My two fav parts was when we realised we'd never see Aubrey's character again and 2nd when Alison's character fights the cliche of getting with the guy at the end like a typical Hollywood film. Overall this movie has an amazing cast and has some important tropes but a very real message and for that I think everyone needs to try to see this. Not to mention it's hilarious.",/review/rw8470021/?ref_=tt_urv
