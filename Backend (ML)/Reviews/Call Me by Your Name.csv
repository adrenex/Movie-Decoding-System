","Denzel Washington is just great and The Equalizer belongs like the John Wick (Keanu Reeves) and Taken (Liam Neeson) movies to the new masterclass of revenge/vigilante movies. The Equalizer is a true to the heart successor of our former (or still) heroes of long gone times like Mr. Eastwood and Mr. Bronson: the king is dead, long live the king, so to say.",/review/rw8247999/?ref_=tt_urv

16 March 2019,FrenchEddieFelson,8," Effective and dynamic
","In the inventory of almost normal heroes like Jason Bourne, Jack Reacher, Frank Castle, Bryan Mills, John Wick, ... here is a brand new one: Robert McCall a.k.a. The Equalizer. He gives a chance to the unlucky ones against the villains, by 'equaliz'-ing the forces. In this first opus, he meets by chance a prostitute as young as lost and ... hop! hop !! hop !!! ... he annihilates the Russian underworld of Boston. Wooooow!. Sounds easy!! The result is rather successful. I loved it.",/review/rw8247999/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2015,Leofwine_draca,8," Denzel nails it
","An intense and towering performance from Denzel Washington as one of cinema's best-acted action heroes is what makes THE EQUALIZER stand out from the crowd, although as a film it's also a very decent thriller. It's supposedly a big screen version of the '80s TV series with Edward Woodward, although think of it as your usual vigilante movie and you'll be closer.",/review/rw8247999/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Great movie
","Really great action sequences, with some nice violent ends, and a very interesting story that almost feels like it starts in the middle, leaving you guessing about his past. It kind of has a very John Wick feel to it, but maybe slightly less over-the-top crazy.",/review/rw8247999/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2014,LloydBayer,7," Gruesome at times, The Equalizer is a rewarding action film for every single Denzel Washington fan out there.
","Rooting for a badass hero with a kickass attitude has never been as satisfying as watching Denzel Washington dish out some brutal punishment. This is exactly what you get in The Equalizer, an action thriller based on the late 80's TV series of the same name, but amped up with ultra-violent realism.",/review/rw8247999/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2014,CalRhys,," A Stylish And Daring Action Thriller
","Antoine Fuqua's and Denzel Washington's paths collide once more as they come together to create a stylish and daring action thriller about a man with a mysterious past, whose quiet life suddenly turns into a rip- roaring adventure of guns and thrills. Both Denzel Washington and Chloe Grace Moretz give stellar performances and display perfect chemistry as two friends stuck in a world of crime and violence. Arguably Fuqua's best film since 'Training Day', 'The Equalizer' is a brutal and merciless tale that explores the Russian underworld on the East Coast and the corruption ties within the law enforcement of Boston's police department.",/review/rw8247999/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2015,mjacksongta,8," Home Depot EQUALS a bad place to be while on Robert McCall's bad side
","In terms of an action movie I gave the equalizer a 7 but soon after felt the need to watch it again and then upped it to an 8. Why? We'll it's an action movie but yet there's no crazy car chases, there's no bombs or heavy big explosions every where. Really the only action scenes are the fight scenes and even they don't come that often. But when they do come they deliver. Denzel is as awesome as ever in these scenes and the creativity in these scenes are what sets it apart from every other action movie. The main character Robert McCall in an ex specialist of some sort, you don't know what at first but know that he's highly trained in something and is now working as an ordinary man working at Home Depot or home Mart as it is in the movie. He looks like just your every day man but can kill you with just about any everyday weapon. And he does this so calmly that big crazy car scenes and explosions would rake away from his character. A man that takes the bus to come kill a whole gang is pretty bad ass by any standard. ",/review/rw8247999/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2015,kosmasp,9," King Kong ain't got ...
","You have to give it up for Denzel Washington. Liam Neeson has been the action hero of late (or so many will have you believe), but watching this, you know he isn't alone. I haven't seen John Wick yet, but apparently it's a fun ride too. There is drama in this too and it's still weird seeing Chloe Moritz in an adult role, but she's doing a good job with a small but important role.",/review/rw8247999/?ref_=tt_urv

1 October 2014,The_Film_Cricket,," Denzel Washington in ""The Toolbox Murders""
","In its introductory scenes The Equalizer is not a bad movie. However, once the plot gets underway it becomes one. Here is yet another movie about a one-man arsenal hell-bent on mopping the floor with grimy hoodlums who are turning the world into a cesspool of inhuman cruelty while wallowing in blood and gore. You've seen this movie before – an ordinary guy walks into a room full of gun-toting thugs and, in 40 seconds of jump cuts, dispatches everybody in the room and then struts out the door accompanied by a rock soundtrack.",/review/rw8247999/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2014,bbickley13-921-58664,8," Denzel Washington is dope
","Action, drama, humor, Denzel can due it all. Based on the TV show, Denzel Washington is yet another old man, similar to Pierce Bronson in the November Man, trying to prove he's still got it by playing a mysterious dude who works at a Megamart who decides to help a young hooker who got beat up pretty badly and ends up taking down some major hitters in the Russian Mafia, then becomes a target for the main boss.",/review/rw8247999/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2014,ToddWebb,6," Mostly atmosphere, zero story
","At the end of it all, I found this movie very boring. The story is old as dirt. The plot is so obvious that as soon as characters appear on screen one can identify, ""He'll be killed,"" ""She'll be kidnapped and used as bait,"" ""Something bad's gonna happen to him,"" and my all-time favorite, ""He's the innocent, likable guy introduced early then ignored for 90 minutes (so we'll forget about him), only to have him turn up as a hostage in the big showdown."" And every prediction is spot-on.",/review/rw8247999/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2014,billygoat1071,6," Colder Opportunities
","The Equalizer is loosely based on an 80s television series with the same name. This reinvention in comparison aims to be darker and much violent, but the film's ambition is basically turning its star, Denzel Washington, into a grittier action hero. It somehow pays off when he starts killing bad guys in cold blood, and it's amazing how he could still carry the character's humanity along the way. The film troubles when it gets out of hand to its glorious vigilantism despite it takes place in a world seems apart from that context. If you tend to ignore the sentiments and shade of reality, you can still tell that it's a pretty entertaining piece of action, but in general it's just difficult to not notice its mess of tones, even with that amount of fun.",/review/rw8247999/?ref_=tt_urv

10 June 2015,Wizard-8,," Predictable but watchable
","I am not sure why the makers of this movie bothered to get the rights to do a movie version of a television series when the movie has very little of the elements that were found in the television series. I guess the most plausible reason would be that being an official movie adaptation of a television series, the movie would have instant ""branding"" and make it easier to market than a movie with a more original plot line and characters. Anyway, the story and characters in this movie are for the most part nothing you haven't seen before either on television or in other movies. You'll be pretty much able to predict what happens before it actually does. On the other hand, these predictable elements are put forward in a professional manner. Washington does well playing someone with a dark past who is still good at his game, the action scenes are brutal and fairly exciting, and the movie as a whole looks very nice. So I'm giving this movie a cautionary recommendation. If you are looking for something new, look elsewhere. But if you don't mind seeing the same plot and characters all over again, you'll find this movie a well crafted retread.",/review/rw8247999/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2020,lukem-52760,8," DENZEL WASHINGTON IS FANTASTIC, PROBABLY MY FAVE DENZEL FILM.
","I loved ""The Equaliser"" & i loved the legendary Denzel in his role as the extremely skilled & dangerous ""Robert McCall"" an ex-CIA Agent turned Urban Vigilante. Denzel is one of the greatest actors in cinema history FACT & i grew up watching & loving this guy & over the years he's cranked out some Amazing films such as ""Training Day"" & ""Man on Fire"" & ""Deja Vu"" & ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" & ""The Bone Collector"" & many, many more films. I'm a fan of Denzel but some of his flicks i didn't like such as ""Inside Man"" & ""The Book of Eli"" (terrible ending) & ""2 Guns"" but most of his work is usually excellent with excellent performances.
Here Denzel gives another incredible performance to his big list of great roles!!! McCall is a deadly man but a good man who will stop & help someone in trouble & here set in Boston he gets in deep trouble with the local scum, the Violent Russian gangsters who pimp out young girls & here ""McCall"" helps out a young brutalized girl ""Teri"" played greatly by Cloe Grace Moretz & comes head to head with a very dangerous man called ""Teddy"" played intensely by Martin Csokas, we also have a small role for the excellent Bill Pullman who turns up later in the film.
Director Antoine Fuqua has created a fantastic urban vigilante action Thriller that's exciting, gritty, brutal & fun.
The fact Robert McCall works a regular ordinary job in a hardware store is just genius & grounds everything is a sense of realism.
McCall goes about his violent business cleaning up a dark crime ridden Boston & meets good people as well as bad people.
Some of my favourite moments are just of McCall sitting in the all night diner reading his book & drinking his tea, little scenes like that are just beautiful with the night time setting & the look of the city streets at night are all captured beautifully.",/review/rw8247999/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2014,MediaPanther,8," Washington nails it
","Antoine Fuqua's big screen adaptation of the 80′s TV series The Equalizer opens with an impressive tracking shot through an open window, and into the orderly and near empty apartment, belonging to Robert McCall (Denzel Washington). McCall lives a Spartan existence; for the first twenty minutes of the picture, he hardly says a word. Fuqua (Training Day) gives a lengthy shot as you watch McCall fold something delicately into a napkin. When you see him unfold the napkin at his regular diner, and place the teabag into a cup of hot water, you understand immediately that this man is a creature of habit, firmly set in his ways. Every night he's there, reading a book. He's such a regular, that he strikes up a familiar acquaintance in a young teenage prostitute, Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz)), which eventually grows into something of a friendship. There is something undeniably hidden within him, however. When he realizes the danger Teri is in thanks to her nefarious Russian pimps, he forgoes his cautious life, and willingly brings on the pain.",/review/rw8247999/?ref_=tt_urv

10 October 2014,TheAnimalMother,6," Welcome To The Black Rambo
","Fairly solid action scenes, characters and overall execution. Somehow the filmmakers and actors make this very hard to believe film enjoyable. This is definitely a sensationalistic film(The most sensationalistic of Washington's career without a doubt.), and it's mostly a regurgitated cookie cutter crowd pleaser of violent vengeance as well, but it does manage to remain quite an entertaining action film at the same time. Even though it has a running time of over two hours, the film does feel overall as though it is missing a few key scenes, but nonetheless it's still worth a look if you're into these kinds of films. The movie didn't remind me much at all of the old T.V. series of the same name. The film is much more reminiscent of some of the old brutally violent morality tales that Charles Broson use to do. All that said, this basically chalks up as a good film to watch when you don't want to think much, and you just want to watch a lot of kick ass entertaining violence. It's that kind of guilty pleasure. 6.5/10",/review/rw8247999/?ref_=tt_urv
