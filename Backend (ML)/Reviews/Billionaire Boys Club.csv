20 September 2014,tenlegdragon,7," More like ""Fun Nation""
","You can tell exactly what this show is about when Harold goes ""God, I hate moral dilemmas."" Not that I don't like Walking Dead and their special episodes, but by God, it's just refreshing to have people killing zombies without constantly wondering about the meaning of life and the universe and God and nihilism and every damn thing under the sun.",/review/rw3087552/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2014,chicagopoetry,10," Z Nation is tons of fun
","The only reason I can think that people are so down on this show is that they are The Walking Dead fans and they're upset because now there is a much livelier, scarier, gorier and more violent version of it. Unlike TWD Z Nations has a keen sense of humor. Some of the one liners are simply hilarious. In the second episode, while entering a gas refinery that is swarming with the undead, one of the characters sighs, ""Fracking Zombies."" It's moments like this that gives Z Nation a certain energy that TWD doesn't have, since TWD takes itself all too seriously. Z Nation is to TWD what Sunny in Philadelphia is to Seinfeld. It's like TWD on crack. Just two episodes into it and already there has been some very memorable and horrific scenes, like the infant baby zombie in the first episode or the zombies covered in black oil in the second. Finally Asylum, known for such quirky low budget flicks as Sharknado, is doing something solid. I'm a fan. I will be watching it every week.",/review/rw3087552/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2020,twanster-97655,10," Epic fun.
","I was absolutely gutted that they cancelled this show. I rewatched them again recently and it's still good. They could have carried this on for a while. The characters are awesome. The plots are sometimes goofy and always gory. There was so many directions to take Murphy in but for whatever reason they've chosen to stop making it. A real shame as this show holds its own in a zombie filed market. The writers and cast should have carried on. Well worth watching if you haven't seen it.
All round good fun.",/review/rw3087552/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2018,RobLuvsTheMountains,7," Very good show until season 5
","Seasons 1-4 get a rating of 9 stars from me. I rate season 5 with 3 stars. This show has been funny and highly entertaining until season 5. One of the things that made this show so good was that the writers managed to find a good balance,keeping the political stuff to a minimum and there wasn't a lot of deep diving into emotional dilemmas. This season the writing is sappy and feels forced with lame lines about ""who we want to become"" and ""not acting out of fear"" blah blah blah. As if having legitimate concern about someone eating your brains is some sort of silly fear that should be scorned. The writing this season is terrible! The ""Talkers"" won't eat you if they get enough biscuits that contain human brains. The viewer seems to be expected to just accept this premise no questions asked. Who makes the biscuits and where are they getting brains from? And why aren't our characters having a moral dilemma with THAT?! In previous seasons anything that seemed stupid in the writing wasn't a problem b/c the show was so fun to watch. This season is nothing but a lame lecture.",/review/rw3087552/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2014,antsquires74,7," Cheesy, silly and fun
","This is not a TWD replacement or competition, certainly in its current state. Not that TWD is the epitome of excellence but the apparent lack of budget and mostly unknown actors give Z Nation a less professional finish.",/review/rw3087552/?ref_=tt_urv

16 December 2017,bshaef,8," One of My Faves
","Znation is very well written and the actors, especially Doc and Murphy, are great. My favorite alltime scene was when the cheese wheel of zombies came rolling through town. I think that was in season 3. It takes a really inventive mind to create something like that. I also like Murphy's relationship with Lucy and shed a tear when she kicked the bucket. You can always leave it up to Doc to drop a couple of bon mots in each show. I look forward to watching the show every week and have never missed a minute. I used to think TWD was a better show but no more. Znation is better because it runs the gamut of emotions from silliness to terror. Give the writers an A+ as well as the actors.",/review/rw3087552/?ref_=tt_urv

23 September 2014,gaulinator,9," Honestly a good show.
","I think the problem here is that everyone is comparing this show to the Walking Dead, which in my opinion, has failed the zombie genre. The first two episodes of this show had me on the edge of my seat and the graphics were quite good (obviously not HBO good). The zombies in the show are terrifying and yes some of the acting is a bit stiff but its SYFY, they do have a budget, and they're spending it on the right thing, graphics. Almost non-stop action is what propels the show and a new ""smart zombie"" spin is whats going to keep me watching. Im tired of watching zombies get speared through the holes of a fence, it's time to let the humans be the hunted! I highly recommend you give this show a try because in my opinion they're doing almost everything right and it could be one of the most thrilling shows to grace the airwaves in a while.",/review/rw3087552/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2019,koofasa,3," Started well and ended in our dystopia present
","TV shows about zombies can be made so that viewers question their place in the universe and measure how delicate life and humanity are. We can ask questions like what happens when we die or do we lose our humanity when we transform into something else? In the first season of Z Nation a team of live people are trying valiantly to move a man who is immune to the zombie virus to a lab across the country. The man the team is moving, Murphy, is very selfish and doesn't really care about humanity one way or another. He is not very cooperative and is very unlikable. Murphy never becomes a better person or zombie. The team who moves him changes a bit but the main people like Warren, Addie, doc and 10k stay the same until the end. By the last season zombies have morphed from scary dead monsters into a category of protected people. Just because someone is dead doesn't make them less and the implication is that you're a bad person if you don't want to share space with a zombie who is only animated by eating human brains. One episode is dedicated to reviewing the shortcomings of the US constitution because all people were not equally protected from the beginning. It is sadly a commentary on how the Hollywood writers of today must view themselves as marginalized. That was the only conclusion I could come to with the storyline in the last season. Their new leader to start a brave new world is a biological female named George who is about 25 years old. She has never seen the constitution before which is probably true for most 25 year-old Americans these days. So while story started somewhere on our future, it ended right here where we all live today. The political message ruined what had been a fun but campy show.",/review/rw3087552/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2018,eric-wallis,7," Used to be so good!
","The first couple of seasons were so good and so much fun that I used to look forward to Friday nights just to watch this show! Things started to get bad in season 4. The acting was really bad, the story line was boring. And the new characters were intolerable (Sarge). Season 5 is just unbearable! Terrible acting and a rotten premise. If I wanted to watch stupid politics, I would turn on the news. PLEASE make this show about killing zombies again!",/review/rw3087552/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2014,alxandrbs,9," whats wrong with people? its entertaining!
","i don't know whats wrong with people here,have you ever watched an original old zombie movie? z-nation is much closer to the real deal than TWD. i liked it pretty much and i know i wasn't the only one. i don't know if people getting paid to write bad reviews , but i assume ,yes -- the acting is how it supposed to be,and again,just watch some old zombie movies to compare. its a good cast,too.It is easy to remember the characters. The story is funny and it has some new ideas ,which TWD couldn't pull of.i was surprised that is was a scyfy series,i thought it was fx. :-( overall a nice series,hope for many seasons despite that paid trolling.Just watch it instead of just writing bad reviews cause you think thats the wave to float with. :-)",/review/rw3087552/?ref_=tt_urv

2 November 2014,bregund,7," Don't compare it to The Walking Dead, enjoy it for what it is
","Z Nation is one of the faster-paced zombie shows I've seen, they pack a lot of story into each episode. If you want a different take on a zombie apocalypse, this program is certainly an enjoyable diversion, and if you want something even more different, check out In The Flesh, which is just as fresh and funny as Z Nation. This program takes the time to develop the characters and give each one a background, and even more importantly they all have continuity. My hat is off to Keith Allan as Murphy, he plays the character with as many faults, regrets, indecisiveness, and human shortcomings as you might imagine. He is at once both funny and chilling as the human/zombie hybrid, switching from a kind of folksy relatability to an inhuman, focused precision from one scene to the next. This isn't the best program on television, but it's certainly non-stop entertainment.",/review/rw3087552/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2018,trademarcdesigns,3," A good show gone bad
","Z Nation was initially a fairly entertaining show - not great, but a competent cast, competent writing, good plotting and fast pace. But after a few seasons - two, maybe three - it changed. The plots became bizarre (and not in a good way), the pacing slowed to an excruciating level, the constant cast changes shattered the original dynamic, and the only action was the same zombie-head-bashing fight scene repeated endlessly.",/review/rw3087552/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2014,lknowlton,9," I really like Z Nation.
","It's a great show. Trying to save the world by keeping a jerk alive and getting him to California.The jerk is really good at being a jerk... Some of the lines the actors are given are a bit cheesy and the timing is sometimes a bit off at times between guest characters speeches. I think the dialog writing could be a bit more natural. I really like D J Qualls. He's a doll. His scene looking for people from the bite mark project to get back to him was great. Being from Canada I love the Northern Light station scenes. I like the young couple and the older gentleman. They are pretty cool and good actors. The leaders of the band are very good as well. Since so far 10,000 hasn't been in much it's hard to tell. Over all I think this show is very entertaining and I'm hoping it continues to be so. There are some unexpected surprises in the show and that is good - like the oil tank. What did Citizen Z name the dog by the way?",/review/rw3087552/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2018,RobLuvsTheMountains,7," LOVED this show...not liking this season so much
","I have watched this show from the first episode and have not missed an episode. I have always thought it was wildly entertaining, funny, and surprising. The characters are interesting to watch and so engaging! Even when Murph was a disagreeable jerk I liked him and kinda saw a little of myself in him. This show didn't dwell on moral dilemmas, political issues, or beating us over the head with trauma like TWD did. (I watched EVERY episode of TWD from ""Days Gone By"" until ""The Day Will Come When You Won't Be."" At which point I stopped and never watched TWD again.) This season of Z Nation looks like it is getting into political stuff.",/review/rw3087552/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2014,mhorg2018,1," Another garbage team up from SYFY/The Asylum
","Epic Fail. Before anyone starts flipping out and saying ""Oh, he doesn't like it because it's not the Walking Dead."" Wrong. I'm glad it's not the Walking Dead, but it is, the walking crap. Why? Several reasons: #1 The Asylum. They've never done crap worth watching. A lot of this show is based on their previous failures, Rise of the Zombies and Zombie Apocalypse. Both of which were painfully bad to watch. #2 Stupid story inconsistencies. Perrineaus character was supposed to be a MILITARY MAN and MILITARY MEN follow orders. So he worries about a ZOMBIE BABY? Why? Who gives a damn? Leave it to rot. #3 The Zombie baby. I don't care if it's a zombie. It's still a baby. Babies have no coordination, and if they're zombies, it's even less coordination. #4 Girl in the cage. She was in there two days. Out in the elements. She wasn't dehydrated? She lost the keys? INSIDE THE CAGE? She also had a knife. Couldn't stab those zombies through the eyes? Kill them off? #5 Running zombies. I concur with George Romero (who's survival of the dead was as bad as this.) Hate them and will continue to hate this idea. I love 28 Days Later, but curse them for their influence on zombie films. #6 Most of these actors stink. Typical Asylum. Get one star who needs a paycheck as a hook, then get rid of him. Thomas Scott has really fallen to be in this trash. #7 SFX - runs the gamut from trashy bad CGI to just about decent practical stuff. Typical for anything by the Asylum. I think that those who trumpet ""IT'S BETTER THAN THE WALKING DEAD! have an extremely low attention span, about the same as those who love anything by the Asylum.",/review/rw3087552/?ref_=tt_urv
