7 October 2016,s3276169,7," Classic Brit Crime Thriller with an international twist....
","Paranoid is a Brit crime drama that follows the ""classic formula"" whilst adding in a twist, in the form of an international conspiracy.",/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2021,AuroraLaude,5," It doesn't mean they're not out to get you
","It's a crime drama with a tone problem. The tone problem comes from the awkward and melodramatic romantic subplot between the lead detectives, and the odd construction of Indira Varma's character, which is the fault of the writer. Varma delivers a great performance even though the bad dialogue written for her role makes her character codependent on men. The relationship between her and her longtime boyfriend is forced, in order to manufacture conflict with her detective partner, and not believable. The series would have been better served by focusing on the role corporate corruption played in the crime. Christiane Paul, Polly Walker, and Kevin Doyle offer strong performances in their supporting roles.",/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2018,lwio1960,5," Not great, a bit of a waste of talent
","Watched this recently and was a bit disappointed. The writer or perhaps the director seemed to be in a muddle. There were some good sections, Germany some of the police investigations but then it diverted into soap opera world. This must be one of the worse police sections in the world. 
Nina intentionally annoying, I hope, would not last a day on a real police force and as for Bobby he should have been on sick leave a year ago. 
Germany was good but when Nina came on I was almost throwing the remote at the tv. Worth a watch but be prepared to be frustrated.",/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2020,raynelanfier,5," If cops would really be so incompetent and unfocused, they'd all be dead
","So. I guess it's a feelgood series... I don't know, but it doesn't represent anything serious. Suresh is quite infantile and absolutely not professional at her job. She almost comes across as dumb. I really don't know what exactly she has contributed to the entire investigation... except for being the clown of the series. It's unprofessionalism galore. Cops not being able to contain their tempers, cops going off on their own like cowboys in the Wild West, cops discussing sex, being pregnant at the most inconvenient times... I felt it to be messy and weird. The storyline was pretty ok, and somehow it felt like they were trying to imitate Harlan Coben's style, but doing a poor job of it. I know for a fact that every single actor in that series is talented. They are not to blame for this poor storyline",/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2016,paulcreeden,8," Decent fusion of Brit detective genre.
","This is not ""Luther"" or ""Marcella"", granted. But it's not ""Murder, She Wrote"" either. I think Indira Varma deserved better writing. She is a great talent. The love-sick puppy, Dino Fetscher's part, wore thin. Polly Walker as the pathological liar was great. Michael Maloney, Lesley Sharp, Robert Glenister, Neil Stuke. Come on. It was just fun to see them assembled for this. Christiane Paul was delightful as Detective Felber. Danny Huston put in his boiler-plate meanie. No surprise there.",/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2016,toohot66,9," Gripping Drama
","I read a lot of negativity before I watched this. Some of the negative things I can understand, but a lot of it seems like total crap. If you want realism - do not watch crime shows except for maybe on The Discovery Channel and like minded channels. Try to watch with an open mind and perhaps you'll be surprised of what you like. This had me hooked from the beginning till the end. The characters are flawed and fragile and all of them are more real than I have seen in a while. Nina is at times so annoying and at the same time so fragile - you sense she's had a tough life. And she reveals a little at a time of this to Alec as they grow closer. He's seen her at her worst and is still intrigued. His own troubled background with his lying mother has him falling for Nina's full on openness. ",/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2017,murfit,4," acceptable premise, horrible script
","The basic plot is thin and has been done dozens of times. That wouldn't be a problem, if the execution were good. It isn't.",/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2016,paynes2001,8," Much better than reviews suggest
",I am frankly surprised by the negative reviews of paranoid. The series is by no means an award winner but it is very entertaining and suspenseful. Casting is a plus and settings in UK and Germany make it interesting. As for the premise: evil pharma- quite believable. Indira Varma from Luther and Robert Glenister (Code of a Killer) are well suited to their roles as dysfunctional police.I plan to source a few more with Christiane Paul who plays the German police officer Linda Felber. She was that good. To reiterate: don't be deceived by a few negative reviews.There are many worse ways to spend a few hours.,/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2019,npjy83,2," Off focus
","I love crime mysteries / detective series. I had just finished watching ""Line of Duty"", ""Safe*, and ""Broadchurch"" which I all really enjoyed and was looking for a new crime series. I decided to watch ""Paranoid"" and after watching the first episode, I really disliked it. The show focuses more on the individuals (detectives) within the series rather than focusing on the crime itself. It is very slow paced and the acting is fake. You can tell in some scenes that the director has just shouted ""And Action"" and the actors begin speaking their parts. It's not directed very well whatsoever.",/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2016,armadeussexmachina,9," This show is great.
","Not sure what the one star reviewer is talking about, although I do respect their right to their own opinion. This show is a pleasure to watch. ",/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2016,klazterp-84450,2," Some good aspects, but a big fail
","You can see how this series was green-lighted. The concept is interesting and I'm sure the abbreviated version of the script was excellent. So Netflix decided to throw some money at it. And it shows, production value is high.",/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2016,cianodwyer,7," Promising and dramatic
","The reviewer who gives one star is misguided. He likes Marcella which i felt was scattergun drivel. This Paranoid show has some soul and some pathos. Plus only 2 episodes in its all very interesting and mysterious and i have no idea where its headed. Don't listen to then reviewer he likes pap clearly. The main characters in this are believable and flawed and the story is believable enough to swallow. I say the actors are good and are a good mix that work well together. Its also not eerily dark tones which is all the rage these days and was good for a show or two but now is pretentious and annoying. Anyway i like it and it has enough mix of plot, storyline and character unrevealing to keep me going.",/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2016,rohinikumar-86721,8," Suspenseful, but warm and human
",This felt more like a suspenseful but cozy Inspector Lynley mystery than the newer generation of atmospheric Netflix thrillers. ,/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2017,davidshort10,1," Awful, awful, awful
","I'm trying to stick with it but it's hard. I subscribed to Netflix to watch The Crown and I enjoy some of the stuff available. they attracted me because of excellent cast, but I am struggling to stay with it. The principal people are plainclothes English police but they are always referred to as Detective this or Detective that. Similarly with the German police. But no one is called 'Detective' in the British police. In plainclothes, you begin as a Detective Constable, then you are a Detective Sergeant, then you are a Detective Inspector, then a Detective Chief Inspector, then a Detective Superintendent, then a Detective Chief Superintendent. Rank is precious and alway referred to. The daft, angry Indian detective once berates a witness for not deferring to her because she is the 'senior detective'. Well, how would the witness know when even we don't know if she is a sergeant and her younger colleague is a colleague? It's just sloppy. Lots of discussion about missing typewritten notes but nobody thinks to try and read the typewriter ribbon. And if a burglar came to take the typewritten notes, wouldn't he take the ribbon? Just nuts.",/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2017,archanademonia,4," Great, if you enjoy whiny and annoying characters
","I spent 6 episodes before I was interested in the story. The only reason I forced myself through them all was that I thought to myself ""only 8 episodes, and only one season. I can do this"" every 10 minutes. Nina Suresh, one of the main leads, is a poorly written character, and I cannot believe a veteran such as Indira Varma said yes to this role. She (Nina) is unbelievably annoying, silly, and acts extremely selfish and unprofessional. I don't think anyone would hold any job if they behaved like Nina. She irritated me throughout the entire season, which is very sad, because I usually find Indira Varma a pretty decent actress. I guess she did her role truly well. Only half as annoying, but still very much so - is her ""german counterpart"", their Skype- detective Linda Felber. Why were these female characters written to appear so unprofessional and silly? Is it to ensure there are no strong female characters in crime shows ever again? One will never know. On the other hand, I found one of the male characters, Bobby, to save the Day (hirr). The only character I didn't want to throw rotten tomatoes on.",/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2016,xhidden99,5," I want to like this but I can't
",To be honest a lot of my irritation has to do with the person I'm watching with; a woman who literally will not shut up will not pay attention will not stop asking questions and who then argues with me interrupts and shouts me down while I'm answering hundreds of her questions to the point I'm only able to watch about 50% of it. People like this is why Gilmore Girls was a hit. Non stop squirrels on meth chatter where it does not matter what they say. ,/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2016,hrmhessler,9," Paranoid is very satisfying
","Classic British cop show with heart. The setting in a small country town rings true. The relationships among the detectives are warm and supportive which seems realistic for a smaller department. Each character is well drawn and the dialogue is witty and smart. For example, British crime shows can be so self absorbed and grim, but the stern, haunted detective, Bobby, is also gentle and has the ability to self-deprecate. Ditto for the German detectives and their side of the action. The crime under investigation is scary and the action is non-stop. I was completely engaged by all aspects of this show. Hope there will be a season 2.",/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2019,lucydady,3," Absolutely awful
","I usually really enjoy police procedural dramas but this was the TV show equivalent of being smacked in the face repeatedly with a rusty spade. Plot holes galore, deeply unconvincing characters with no development and a script that should have been binned at the very start.
The only saving grace for me was Christiane Paul as Linda Ferber who was just the right mix of smart and quirky.
Overall, this is an embarrassment of a series and I can understand the numerous negative comments.",/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2017,khunkrumark,1," Just awful!

16 November 2020,levybob,3," So bad, I skipped Episodes 6 and 7. And I did not miss a thing.
","This is awful stuff. I love actress Indira Varna and so I gave the series two 'tries'. In the first attempt I lasted till Episode 2. I waited a year or so and then tried again. I viewed Episodes 1 - 5 and was about to again call it quits, when I got an idea. Since so much of the series had been nonsense (red herrings, blind alleys, overly dramatic music, laughable dialogue .... ) I decided to skip Episodes 6 and 7, go directly to Final Episode 8, and see (a) if I missed anything and (b) what the resolution of the mystery proved to be.",/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv

6 March 2020,exsup,1," Awful
","Sorry folks but what could have been a great series is marred by the anoying woman detective.
If only she would keep her mouth shut it might be worth watching .",/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2020,petter-38,3," How can you make so many episodes about nothing?
","What's with TV these days? A story that used to be told in 1 hour and 45 minutes is now 8 x 45 minutes. Literally nothing happens, and I blame myself for keep watching. In the end it becomes like an investment of time, so I just have to see it through.",/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2021,Casino-Royale,1," Five minutes in...
",And I'm ready to give up. The lead female is the most irritating character ever. Why her colleagues didn't tell her to just shut up every 5 seconds is beyond. Totally ruined whatever potential it had.,/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2017,byers-kat,1," Most inept Detectives I have ever seen...EVER!
","How they would, in reality, let Nina Suresh be a Police Officer (much less a Detective) is totally unbelievable. She is so wrapped up in herself that she poo-poo's obvious leads and only cares about her passing youth. She would be more fit for a Detective spoof than a serious crime drama. More believable characters in that old movie ""The Gang that couldn't shoot straight"". I understand wanting to bring in the human side of being a detective, but damn, her character is laughable in a serious role. Maybe Inspector Gadget would have been a better choice.",/review/rw3712255/?ref_=tt_urv
