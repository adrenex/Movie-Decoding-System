4 January 2023,FilmFanatic2023,8," A Gripping and Informative Look at the Madoff Scandal
","A gripping and informative true crime documentary series directed by Joe Berlinger. The series details the rise and fall of Bernie Madoff, a Wall Street executive who ran a massive Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors of billions of dollars. Berlinger uses a mix of expert interviews and recreations to tell the story, with author Diana B. Henriques serving as a particularly knowledgeable and engaging guide through the complex events. The final chapter of the series focuses on the heartbreaking fallout of Madoff's crimes, including the impact on his family and the investors who lost everything.",/review/rw8791264/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2023,Lejink,8," Madoff With All Their Money
","...Or how to lose 19 billion dollars...of other people's money. Bernie Madoff was indeed the monster of the title here, an ambitious, ruthless individual who found that the best way to not just personal fortune and fame but also tacit acceptance within Wall Street, was to create the world's biggest ever Ponzi Scheme, which basically as I understand it means taking other people's money without ever investing it, instead hoarding it and paying out withdrawal requests from this ever-growing stockpile of cash. Using secretive and in truth wholly rudimentary methods to report to his ""clients"", once he had everyone thinking he was the emperor, it took the market-shattering financial crash of 2008 to finally strip the charlatan of his credibility and finally expose him as the fraudster he was.",/review/rw8791264/?ref_=tt_urv

","Fantastic true crime documentary directed by joe berlinger, and coming to be one of the finest products on how to get an insight into the bernhard madoff ponzi scheme case, made possible through dilligent reasearch and a very well made dramatization by his production crew... a product thats quite on the brink of overwhelmingness to binge for breakfast...and just another star on my chart for being concerned about how economics really works when the road is cleared for any obstacles and monitoring, and crimes like this could happen... and does happen... and will happen in the years to come.",/review/rw8791264/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,h2223,5," My 5 rating is for the docuseries, not the Madoff story itself
","This is an absolutely fascinating story, mainly because it proves that truth is stranger than fiction. How on earth can a single man hold so much sway over people with his personality, that he can avert their attention so they don't notice the biggest swindle in Wall Street history happening? Because that's what it was -- Bernie Madoff using the force of his personality to continue to cajole and convince the SEC and other investigators to look the other way even in the face of overwhelming evidence of fraud.",/review/rw8791264/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2023,Batmanfan86,8," Wow!!
","I am becoming a CFE. Certified Fraud Examiner. There were things I was not aware of that Madoff did. I watched Wizard Of Lies and they left out some things I wish they would have put in. This documentary did a lot of justice and more insights than anything else I have seen. I really liked the depositions from Madoff himself. I have not seen any of these until now. I also enjoyed how real life Madoff employees gave their insights on what it was like to work with Madoff. Again, really enjoyed this documentary. I still hate how he defrauded all of these people and in turn, he called his ""clients"" Greedy!! What a scum-bag.",/review/rw8791264/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2023,douglasmcbroom,8," Mostly Excellent
","What is not excellent and what was used to really sell this documentary as new info, is the salacious and absolutely unproven allegation that Madoff was using organized crime and drug cartel money. The only evidence of this they offer is that Madoff parked money in the Cayman Islands, which even the documentary admitted, so do millions of legitimate investors. The evidence against him using funds from criminal enterprises, however, is overwhelming and ignored. If he were using such funds he would never have had the cash shortfalls he experienced. OG and drug cartel monies are not subject to the vagaries of the markets. Hence, when the market crash came in 2008, Bernie would have been sitting pretty with his OC money. Lastly, if Madoff had been fronting OC money and that yappy dog, Harry Markopolos, was threatening to expose and end the scheme, he would have woken up dead!",/review/rw8791264/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2023,musickrev,7," Compelling story
","An interesting documentary about the ever relevant story of Bernie Madoff (today's model being Sam Bankman-Fried), that is rather too glibly told and marred by crass and clumsily obvious dramatic reconstructions that add nothing of substance. That said, the interviews with a large number of participants are thorough and fascinating. As are the many clips of historical news stories. As ever was and continues to be, the story highlights the human love of wealth, the prestige and status that comes with possessing (or apparently possessing) it, and the follies that inevitably follow. Lots of mistakes made by a lot of people are highlighted as well as the tragic cost of these actions. A sobering reminder that if something appears too good to be true, then it is.",/review/rw8791264/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2023,dylio1,9," A Shakespearian tragedy for the ages
","I really did not know many of the details of the Ponzi scheme going into this documentary so it was definitely eye opening for me. He started out way back in 1960 trading pink sheets (think Wolf of Wall Street). He eventually was an early adopter of the use of technology in trading. The technology his company developed eventually became the NASDAQ. His company was the number one market maker, which means it acts as an intermediary for financial trades, for many years. The most baffling aspect of this whole thing is he would have been plenty wealthy just from this legitimate business. What is the motivation to move to a criminal scheme that causes so much damage? Greed is the simple answer but there is something more. He was clearly a sociopath. Some of the details of the fraud we learn are that he regularly sent falsified statements to investors. They would include a list of fictitious trades with no losses and a nice profit. He did regularly return money to investors who requested it and always kept getting enough new investment dollars to stay one step ahead of these requests. One of the more frustrating aspects of this case is that the SEC was alerted multiple times and failed to do even the most basic of due diligence. For example, all they had to do was verify even a single trade and they would have discovered that the trade did not occur. This documentary is well worth watching even if it is bound to further deteriorate any faith one might have in our financial institutions.",/review/rw8791264/?ref_=tt_urv

","Featuring slow-motion actor re-enactments, the New York Stock Exchange-style display graphics scrolling along the bottom of the screen, and obligatory views of hysterical brokers on the trading floor, it's all really interesting. But I believe that I've had enough of being entertained by the real atrocities of unrepentant guys. At least Madoff: The Monster of Wall Street offers the victims of white collar crimes whose stories are frequently ignored a voice. This series shed light on atrocities that take place in Wall Street and how it is constantly ignored even though multiple red flags. Pity all the victims involved.",/review/rw8791264/?ref_=tt_urv

","I already knew a lot about the Madoff scandal before watching this documentary, but I am glad I watched it because I learned a lot of new things. The amount of new footage and testimony in this documentary is impressive. Madoff and associates perpetrated a despicable financial fraud, and I think not everybody has been properly held accountable for it. The documentary does a great job investigating this and shedding new light on the true dimensions of the Madoff scandal.",/review/rw8791264/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a great series that breaks down and goes in depth into the fraudulent tale of Bernie Madoff. It was very entertaining and well made and I hope Netflix makes more like this. The show interviews different people who have interacted with Madoff in different ways and explains everything from his lifestyle and family, to his frauds and firm on Wall Street. I would recommend for people to watch who are wanting to learn about Wall Street and finance because, rather then just tell a story of a giant scam, it also explains the finance industry and you end up learning a lot about the Wall Street.",/review/rw8791264/?ref_=tt_urv

1960s. The end of I Love Lucy era but the continuation of the conformist culture period that had became a way of American life just in the preceding decade. In the Wild West of the Wall Street, the race to become rich, the exuberance and swashbuckling became the normal operative norms. This gave a rise to an over-the-counter market which then harbored the small mostly less reputable companies and provided an easy loophole for them to trade the unregulated mutual funds based on a pool concept. And then came along a young man who was at right place and at right time and who in order to impress his father-in-law started a small security company for penny-stocks with only few clients with $5000 of his own and rest with a loan from his father-in-law. Later he went on pioneering the computerized trading that would consolidate all the off-the-exchange markets, pink sheets, small firms into NASDAQ. His biggest contribution. He also became a member of the Securities Investors Protection Corporation - SIPC. He was everyone's Go-to-guy!",/review/rw8791264/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2023,paul2001sw-1,8," Class and money
","Bernie Madoff perpetrated one of the greatest frauds in history, but also one of the simplest: he simply pretended to have bought low and sold high, and with great reported profits nobody asked for their money back, at least not until the stock market crashed in 2008. This series describes him an a ""monster"", but I find it hard to hate him as much as the tech frauds: at least he wasn't claiming he could save the world. What's interesting is his ordinary origins (he was New York Jewish middle class, his right-hand man was Italian-American), and the sense to which the scam depended on affinity fraud (selling to people from his own background); the contrast with the Europeans he conned, old-money banking aristocracy, is striking. There are many remarkable details of this story, but like many Netflix documentaries it's slightly too long, with too many people commenting without adding that much information; no-one willing to confess to being aware of the fraud gives an interview (although there is film of Bernie himself claiming all responsibility).",/review/rw8791264/?ref_=tt_urv

","When you realize over the years far more people got rich of oh Bernie than lost in the end it changes your view. I have to agree that so many were so greedy that it is hard to feel bad for them. When everyone else is at best getting 5 or 10% and Bernie is getting you double that with zero loses, you had to know it was fraud. You stuck with him because even if it was fraud you were winning. Crazy seeing that double standard that most of the women get off with nothing but an ankle monitor while men are in prison. When you think of the untold millions he donated to charities and the people who made a fortune off of his scheme....and the greedy who fell in the end it is hard to hate this man.",/review/rw8791264/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2023,wyellen,8," Bernie Madoff destroyed by goverment Ponzi scheme.
","This is a very interesting documentary, but has some leftist slants. The biggest is the decision by the documentary makers to totally ignore the cause of the 08 housing crisis that triggered the collapse of the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme. In the documentary, they simply place the blame on large financial corporations taking large pools of bad mortgages and selling them to whoever would buy them. Certainly, we see that explored in depth in movies like Margin Call. Later, we see a clip of former president Obama referring to the lack of government regulations as an enabler of the housing collapse, and it's later ramifications. It's absolutely true that big time mortgage bankers created exotic financial instruments to disguise sub-prime mortgages and sell them worldwide to anyone willing to take the bait when the market sank into a morass of worthless loans to keep their corporations alive. But the question of why large financial institutions would torpedo the housing market with a blizzard of sub-prime loans and thus force themselves to play musical chairs with piles of worthless mortgages is never mentioned. The answer is that they did so with the greatest reluctance, but had to because of government regulation. Yes, the government demanded lending standards be reduced supposedly so that the poor and disadvantaged could buy homes. President Clinton demanded Freddie Mac and Fanny Mae have at least 50% of their mortgages be sub-prime. Congress took it from there and soon essentially anyone capable of walking into a financial institution could get a mortgage making use of notorious financial instruments like the ""liar loan"". Of course, speculators and people with little money yet eager to buy a house went wild. Not surprisingly, a Cloverfield monster sized housing bubble was created, and as all financial bubbles do, it finally burst in everyone's face. There is no regulator protection from bad politics.",/review/rw8791264/?ref_=tt_urv
