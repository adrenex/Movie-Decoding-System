19 March 2019,deloudelouvain,7," Cloning or not?
","I honestly have no clue why people would think this is a horrible movie. I wanted to watch an entertaining sci-fi movie and that's exactly what I got. No super high tech features but a story that makes complete sense and that is futuristic but not that utopic. What would we all do if we lost loved ones and we had the capabilities to bring them back? It's an interesting story, easy to follow and to understand, keeping you interested until the end. Some reviewers wrote the acting was terrible but I can't agree with that at all. It might not be Oscar winning acting but it was for sure better than the average.",/review/rw4796295/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2019,Leofwine_draca,5," Interesting, until it becomes a different movie
","REPLICAS is a sci-fi drama starring Keanu Reeves as a family man and cutting edge scientist forced into extreme action when he loses his entire family in a car accident. The setup is highly predictable, but the story is handled in a surprisingly sensitive manner, at least for the first two thirds of the running time. We're in dark, moral dilemma territory here, with Reeves convincing as a man pushed to the edge and an interesting look at the rights and wrongs of the action he takes. What's a shame, then, is that the last third becomes a different film entirely, a routine action thriller with so-so CGI effects. It's like they're not allowed to have any moral darkness in the Reeves character, so bring in a stock villain instead, and the film loses something as a result.",/review/rw4796295/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2020,Sleepin_Dragon,5," Something's missing, and not just the plot.
","I really did want to like this movie, who doesn't enjoy watching a bit of Mr Reeves, but sadly it's not great. I was sure I had seen this before, but I was wrong, bigger sci fi enthusiasts will I'm sure know the film I mean, where a woman dies, and is brought back by her husband.",/review/rw4796295/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," Flawed in many ways, but I still enjoyed it.
","The major issue with the film was the writing - the screenplay written by novice Chad St. John (this being his 2nd only screenplay), and the story by a novice Stephen Hamel (this being only his 3rd full length film).",/review/rw4796295/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2018,jelliejune,6," Bad movie that I enjoyed watching
","This must have been one of the strangest movies I've seen all year, and I both liked and disliked it. There's something almost comical about the way this movie progresses and I couldn't help but laugh out loud a few times during it.",/review/rw4796295/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2019,theromanempire-1,6," Ignore the negative reviews. the movie was OK
","Unfortunately in last years I read a lot of hatred reviews that have no relation to the actual quality of the movies from people who are just sad haters and try to influence people not to watch a certain movie with no particular reason.
Replicas is one of those examples.
if u read the reviews u will go to watch the movie having in mind that u might leave the theater in first like 30 minutes or so.
thank god the movie was ok. in fact it was very good in first half and then it had flaws it was not great but it was entertaining enough to keep you interested until the end.
sure this is not one of the best of this genre but to give this movie 1 star or an F grade is at least an atrocious and disrespectful thing to do.
if u like action // fantasy films like the 6th day then this movie is on the same par.
I give it a grade between C+ and B- and I will add it to my dvd collection.
give it a try. it's worth at least one look.",/review/rw4796295/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2019,claudio_carvalho,7," Flawed but Highly Entertaining
","In Puerto Rico, the scientist Will Foster (Keanu Reeves) is researching the transference of the brain memories of soldiers to a synthetic body in the laboratory where he works with his partner and friend Ed (Thomas Middleditch). The experiment does not work and the body is rejected by the donors, and the manager Jones (John Ortiz) is pressing Will telling that the government will shut down the experiment. While traveling with his family to EdÂ´s boat in a stormy night, Will has a car accident on the road and his beloved wife Mona (Alice Eve) and their three children die. Will calls Ed and convinces him to develop clones of his family members to transfer their memories. They have only four pods and the youngest daughter is sacrificed. Now Will needs to make his experiment work since he will not have a second chance.",/review/rw4796295/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2019,FeastMode,1," my notes
","Abysmal. bad everything, especially the acting, plot, dialogue and CGI. Seriously, no exaggeration, the CGI reminded me of the final scene in the original Terminator. Couldn't believe it. Had to watch it again. there are infinity plot holes in this movie. so much makes zero sense. (1 viewing)",/review/rw4796295/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2019,TheLittleSongbird,3," Obsessive replication
","'Replicas' was yet another example of a film where an excellent, promising idea is enough to draw anybody right in. Also appreciate sci-fi with a touch of thriller and do not mind films made on a modest to low budget. Despite what some of my reviews seem to indicate otherwise, namely due to seeing too many of those that don't show much or any signs of effort. Am no fan of Keanu Reeves, but don't hate him as much as others do. He has given the odd above serviceable performance when the material allows, but too many of his films betray his limitations.",/review/rw4796295/?ref_=tt_urv

","The only question I asked after seeing this nonsense; how could professional movie makers look back of this garbage with anything other than embarrassment?
I'll leave the technical critique to others who think this mess was worthy of more comment.

26 January 2019,ThomasDrufke,1," This Should Never Be Replicated
","If your loved ones tragically die in a car accident, and you come away essentially unharmed, what's the first thing you'll think to do? Clone them? Yeah, that's what I was thinking too. That's how ridiculous the plot of this movie is, and the execution is far worse. I love watching Keanu as much as the next guy, he's one of the few movie stars we have left for better or worse, but his acting has never been the reason to see one his films. Replicas, given the absurdity of the story, horrid special effects, and tone deaf direction/narrative, makes for one of the most pointless theater experiences you'll have. So in other words, go see this?",/review/rw4796295/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2018,jayg_58,2," Not sure how to begin..
","Keanu is fine in action flicks with little dialog. This was not one of those. He can't act. He never could. When he plays a lawyer or scientist, he's still a surfer dude with no expression and bad diction. The many close ups in this movie also show that he has a home supply of Botox. The ""science"" in this movie - isn't. In fact out of the blue we jump from cyborgs to cloning with no segue. Somehow he moves an entire laboratory into his basement overnight with no one noticing? The one shot of people pulling up to the lab makes it seem like it's a condo in a suburban neighborhood. The whole movie is jaw dropping ridiculous. You have one A lister, and two B listers. I only kept watching out of disbelief, nothing better to do at the moment, and some good production values. Script? Nah. Acting? The Keanu School - dude. The plot? Well, they tell you in the movie blurb he loses his family and decides to clone them. In 3 weeks, he steals all the government equipment, and totally changes all the research done to that point. And he loves the word ""algorhythm"". The ending makes Disney look dark. Please, go check the fridge for a beer instead. The 10 reviews? Keanu has friends.",/review/rw4796295/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2018,garrymaclachlan-78415,5," Acting terrible but kept me watching

9 November 2019,jwpicton,1," Honey, I grew the kids
","Brain numbing.
At least Sharknado (for example) makes no apologies for being utterly awesome trash, but this?
.... this has almost no redeeming features.
15 minutes in, the branch that the wife was impaled by, magically disappears after the car is in the water (which is BEFORE Reeves fetches her out).
Once he does (lord only knows how he removed that branch) the only indication that she was impaled by a tree in the first place is a modest spot of blood roughly where a gigantic hole should be.
The ""pick a name"" scene?.... No comment
Apart from such poor continuity issues things like plot, character development etc. are nonexistent.
Hmmmmm...
Now if they'd used that Sharknado guy....
Then we might have a movie on our hands ;)",/review/rw4796295/?ref_=tt_urv

",This movie is not the best but it's definitely not the worst. If you are a person who enjoys watching movies without criticizing every little detail I think you'll enjoy it. I did laugh at the CGI but the rest of the movie was good. Those that are rating is it low are being really harsh.

","It wasn't necessarily a bad movie, just a plotline that has been repeated over and over.

","The bad reviews of this movie makes no sense. It's a good flick!
It's not Oscar material, but the script works, it's thrilling and has excellent CGI.
It's a good story! And it avoids the same old dilemma/ethical crap we're so used to from this genre. What a relief! Science fiction lives again! Yahoo!",/review/rw4796295/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2019,view_and_review,2," Movie was D.O.A.
","This movie was so bad. Its first and primary problem was that it thoroughly lacked originality. There wasn't a single original idea throughout the movie. If you're not going to be original then you truly need to give a creative spin to the borrowed concept. As I was watching I saw Minority Report, The Sixth Day, Self/less, Chappie, Ex-Machina, iRobot, and sooooo many other movies that dealt with cloning, transferring consciousness, and other hi tech stuff.",/review/rw4796295/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2019,Vambfly,1," So bad. Not well thought out.
","The premise is fine. 5 minutes in and the acting alone, particularly by the woman who plays his wife, is so bad you just know the movie is going to suck. His family dies (hence the whole premise of the movie so no spoilers) and due to some restrictions at the lab he can only bring back three of his family members. He places their names in a pot and chooses which one he does not bring back. Their memories of her? Oh, we will just erase them. No biggie. He only realizes right before waking them to see if the experiment worked that he has to go through the house hiding all evidence of the one not resurrected. Here's the obvious inevitable problem: how do you delete the entire world's memory of this person? This is so ridiculous. He thought nothing through. I haven't even finished the movie yet, but I'm over it. Not even worth a dollar at the Redbox.",/review/rw4796295/?ref_=tt_urv
