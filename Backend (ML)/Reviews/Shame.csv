24 November 2020,jayjaycee,8," Depression in its rawest form
","""Shame"" is 2011 drama directed by Steve McQueen starring Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan.
⚪
All in all, Steve McQueen's agonising drama reveals the rawest and most vulnerable sides of a depressive sex addict in a crushingly gritty manner, and performs a balancing act between realistically excruciating beauty and disgusting perversity, and due to a powerful lead performance by Michael Fassbender, a shatteringly natural screenplay and McQueen's empathetic direction, it becomes an indescribably melancholic and utterly depressing striptease of the ambiguous kind.
⚪
Will there ever be a time when the name Steve McQueen isn't automatically associated with great films? Well, while the name used to referred to one of the most charismatic action stars of the sixties and seventies, to the King of Cool who produced some revolutionary features, it nowadays refers to a man who made himself a name in another genre. Steve Rodney McQueen, a man born during his namesake's golden era, is responsible for some highly acclaimed dramas of the last few years, most prominently for the historical feature ""12 Years A Slave"". However, before he received his well-deserved Oscar for this film, he directed ""X-Men"" star Michael Fassbender in two other features, the Bobby Sands biopic ""Hunger"" and this title here. While I cannot say much about the first, I can guarantee you that this one here definitely packs a punch and knows to shake you in the very foundations. I don't know if there is such a sub-genre called ""feel bad movies"", but if there is, this title definitely would fall in the category, because it is just painful. The thing is, it is not the kind of pain you experience when watching one of the worse Adam Sandler titles, it is the one you can relate to since it is so utterly realistic. Michael Fassbender breathtakingly portrays Brendon Sullivan, a successful businessman with a decent job, a great apartment and seemingly with no worries at all. Well, that is what it is on the outside, because under the surface of this outwardly handsome and perfect man a tremendous turmoil lies dormant. Brendon is a sex addict who spends most of his time with drive satisfaction. From pornographic material on his laptop, over musturbation to random sexual encounters with prostitutes, he experiences all of it. One might think that he is happy leading his life in a way Hugh Hefner would be proud of, but it is quite the contrary. Despite of all the sexual activities his life is defined by, he is anything but blissful, because even though it is never formally mentioned, he suffers from depression. You don't have to be an expert to take notice of this, because it is evident, nevertheless. In this film, Fassbender bares it all, and I am not only talking about the fact that we get to see Magneto's rod on multiple occasions. Regardless of the graphic nudity and sex scenes, the film's main focus doesn't lie on it at all and only serves as an admittedly drastic but tremendously effective narrative device. Just like hand on hand combat is only a means to an end in ""Fight Club"", sexual activities are only there to veil the true meaning behind what is depicted. In general, it is a character study about a seemingly carefree man living as a bachelor in New York City, but on the inside it is a crushing examination of an addict who tries to cope with his past and other problems that burden him. As already mentioned above, it is never explicitly expressed that he is suffering from depression, but over the course of the film and almost casually, we learn about minimal details about the past of Brendon and his sister Sissy (equally outstandingly played by Carey Mulligan) that explain his behaviour. As the title perfectly suggests, it is about shame in its rawest form. All the sexual activities he engages in are only a way to temporarily drown out the void that haunts him inside, and even if it is far from perfect, it works out in a basic way for him. Until his sister arrives. The imperfect but functioning life he has established comes apart at the seams when she enters this troubled construct, simply because she reminds him of the haunted past too much. Involuntarily, he is supposed to cope with his and with his sister's problems, but you can tell by the look on his face that he is simply unable to master this task. In order to regain the control over his life, he then tries to escape from the cesspool of meaningless sex by dating his co-worker, but eventually learns that healthy relationships and true affection are two things he is incapable. He cannot reciprocate those two human emotions, since his past has scarred him irreparably, and Fassbender conveys this creeping realization and frustration gut-wrenchingly. Only after the attempted suicide of his sister (the most devastating sequence of this drama), he apparently begins to revaluate what is really important in his life, the relationship to his sister included. After having a mental breakdown (the peak of his powerhouse performance!), he encounters the woman on the subway again, the one that he chased after in the beginning despite knowing that she is married. The last shot, him speculating whether he should do it or not, this ambiguity, perfectly rounds up the drama. Will he go back to what he has been, or will he be better than before? The audience is left out in the cold, as then the credits begin to roll, and you don't know if history repeats itself or not. In the end, this film hit me more than I expected it to do. Of course, I was anticipating sadness, but this was just pure depression in blue colours. Raw, unadulterated and absolutely stopping at nothing. It's a soul striptease that also literally strips naked and knows no taboos. Cinema is rarely this devastatingly depressing, and I take my hat off to this brutally realistic gem. Treat it with extreme caution.",/review/rw2750853/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2011,DonFishies,8," An expertly crafted and shocking film that will divide audiences
","Despite having never seen Steve McQueen's Hunger, the smouldering and sensational acclaim for Shame was simply unreal. Having heard terrific things about the film, I ventured out and snagged a last minute ticket to the premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. Weeks later, I am still trying to decipher what may be one of the most shocking and raw films I have seen in quite some time.",/review/rw2750853/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2012,moviemanMA,10," Addiction up close and personal
","Shame, the real feel bad movie of the year, is only McQueen's second feature film to date. His first film, Hunger, focused on a man who made his life very public when he went on a hunger strike during the 1981 Irish Hunger Strikes. In Shame, McQueen dissects the very personal and often shocking sexual addiction of Brandon Sullivan (Michael Fassbender). Brandon is a well off business man. He has an apartment in New York where he leads a seemingly good life, but hides a dark secret that is on the verge of destroying him. His sex addiction has gone out of control. To make this even more difficult, his sister drops in unexpected and crashes at his place (played by Carey Mulligan). Her lifestyle begins to interfere with his addiction, forcing him to take drastic measures.",/review/rw2750853/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2012,Edd-N-Furter,9," It's not about sex, it's about shame
","Brandon's life is almost perfect: a steady job, a nice apartment, good friends and women adore him. But something prevents Brandon from having a relationship that lasts more than four months, this incapacity is due to the fact that Brandon is a sex addict: to casual encounters with strangers and prostitutes, to pornography (both during and after working hours), to masturbation. And to some extent he seems to have his addiction under control, until her sister Sissy arrives unexpectedly looking for a place to live for a while.",/review/rw2750853/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2012,laura_macleod,," Shame is the title but is it really the crux of it?
","There are stories that are about life and all the aspects of life itself and then there are stories that are less like stories and more like studies of people and psychological issues.These kinds of films often leave the viewer with a sense of loss - precisely what Shame does - it brings the viewer into the depth of severe psychological disturbance in two particular individuals and makes one feel the loss that is consuming these people. Brother and sister; obviously victims of sex abuse in childhood of some order - and their current lives and dysfunction. Fassbender plays a man off the scale with severe emotional trauma that manifests itself in constant sex addiction - he is in break down. His sister, played by Mulligan is also in breakdown - the interesting family dynamic that is seen between siblings in abuse cases - they love/hate each other and are left to do the parenting which can never work. Some viewers will find the cold hearted sex scenes at time repetitive and indeed they are. But McQueen is clever in that he brings the viewer on a journey to see the severity of the addiction and all the forms it manifests in - leaving the protagonist tortured, exhausted and haunted. The added burden he takes on, is wanting to be the protector of his sister and then rejecting it - obviously he failed in protecting her in childhood and it still remained in the form of guilt. Often dysfunctional parents do a very heinous crime, in that they project on the children they are abusing ,that it is their fault - thus the long journey to break away and the healing process to even begin. Shame and guilt are heavy barriers in healing. Fassbender's performance is mesmerising. He deserves an award for it. It takes one to the heart of addiction and emotional dysfunction. The end of the film is ambiguous - did he break the cycle or didn't he? Society lends itself to sex and sexual abuse and addiction - on some level we are all obsessed with sex and it passes us by because we are not 'addicts'. The addict can find the outlet easily in modern society as it lends itself to all the vices and pain - but not readily does it lend itself to love. The sense of loss at the end of the film comes to the viewer as it is not clear if the protagonists made it through the darkness to the love that was obviously there in them too, waiting past the trauma and past the addiction.",/review/rw2750853/?ref_=tt_urv

27 April 2020,dillylamar,7," Shame
","Steve McQueen's delivers a realistic and vivid film about sex addiction, anger, self loathing, fear, loneliness, and the meaning or lack of meaning of relationships. Shame's premise is not depicted in film very often, which makes it a very unique effort as well. Micheal Fassbender's performance as sex addict is brillant, as he gives the audience his character's fear, self hatred, anger, and loneliness in full perspective. Carey Mulligan also gives a stellar performance as a needy, dependent, and affectionate musician. Steve McQueen directs this film in a laid back yet ruthless way, as Shame pits into darkness and trauma with somewhat of an elegance, while still maintaing a manic aesthetic. Narratively, Shame can get breifly lost at points, but Overall, McQueen's film is a honest and realistic depiction, with one great performance, and a good one as well. Shame is a small film, but can bring about emotions, panic, trauma, and darkness in a evocative and grim way.",/review/rw2750853/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2020,jnwseatiger,6," What the hell happened to Brandon and Sissy as children?
","Mental Illness done with an outsider looking in. The trauma in their childhood must have been great for these two to suffer what the viewer is witnessing. Any addiction is difficult to watch. I was exhausted after watching this film. Like a hunter Brandon's thirst could never be quenched. He is existing not living. There are so many facets to this fim that are interesting: the boss David's ability to have a family and indulge in sex on the side, people's willingness to go to a bar and have sex with a stranger and then go on with their lives, unaffected. Yet Brandon, with no ties to anyone, is smoldering and suffocating in the weight of his obsession. A good study in human behavior. I don't like sex in film for sensationalism but the sex in this film was like another character, the antagonist.",/review/rw2750853/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2011,littlemartinarocena,8," Cold Sex
","Michael Fassbender's commitment is overwhelming. He must trust his director, implicitly. Good for him. Very rarely we've been exposed to so much sex without an ounce of erotic flavors. Well, that was not the intention, clearly. This is a remarkably serious film about addiction.To make matters even darker I had seen Michael Fassbender as Jung only a few days before. What an actor! Now I feel I'm as familiar with his anatomy as Mrs. Fassbender must be. I must admit the film stayed with me because within its mathematical coldness there is a palpable element of horror. Was it me or Fassbender shows the face of death in one of the many sexual occasions? Chilling really. I will take my chances and recommend it, as long as you don't take your children - I guess you can't NC17 - or your grandparents.",/review/rw2750853/?ref_=tt_urv

I was very disappointed, but not surprised, that this film received no recognition at the awards ceremony. Normally, ""sex, sells"" is written on the heart of all promoters. But not in this case, as it is not at all titillating. A genuinely adult film (not the usual meaning). Fine performances from Michael Fassbinder and Carry Mulligan.",/review/rw2750853/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2012,dfranzen70,3," Come see the world's dullest porno
","Watching Shame is worse than the clichés of watching paint dry or grass grow, because in those instances you know there'll be some sort of satisfying conclusion, some point to it all. If there's a point to Shame, it's so subtle as to be apathetically invisible, which is so say you can't see it and it doesn't much care if you do. It features performances that range from stoic to histrionic, plot development that is nonsensical, scenes that drag on for no discernible reason, and awkward conversations that don't even show the promise of less-awkward conversations later on. It's a soulless, dead-eyed film. Brandon (Michael Fassbender) is supposed to be a porn addict who has gigabytes of the stuff on his PC at work and his laptop at home, plus a lot of magazines; he has anonymous sex with anyone he can find. He's a bit of a nihilist, not moving through life so much as wafting through it like an unpleasant odor. But his sex addiction, let's be frank, is really rather tame. There are probably millions of loner males who indulge in the same behavior. That is, this ain't the same guy played by Christian Bale in American Psycho or by Robert DeNiro in Taxi Driver. Brandon, a well-off exec at some Big Company, simply finds outlets for his desires, sometimes tempting danger, but never resorts to crime or anything requiring emotion. We're meant to take that to mean he's repressing something.",/review/rw2750853/?ref_=tt_urv

29 September 2011,Copyright1994,10," A Masterpiece!
","""Shame"" centers on Brandon (Michael Fassbender), a lonely, self-  alienated man in his thirties who tries his best to appear as your  average New Yorker with an office job whenever he finds himself out in  public. The trouble with this young man-- or his tragic flaw-- is that  whenever he finds a minute of privacy in his day, he hastily delves  into his own fabricated reality: a world of excessive sex, pornography,  and masturbation. The day Brandon's distressed, disruptive sister Sissy  (Carey Mulligan) barges into his condo looking for a place to stay  until things wind down and her sorrows disappear, his life begins to  spiral out of control. He grows increasingly frustrated with her as he  feels her invasive presence will bring about the exposure of his  deepest and darkest secrets. However, we see that this is just a  manifestation of his feelings of intense shame and regret for leading  the sad, artificial life he believes is the only one fit for him.  Steve McQueen has the sheer audacity to go where very few filmmakers  have dared to go before by making a film about sexual addiction and its  effects on the human mind. In this ambitious boldness, he doesn't want  to hold back on anything and he isn't afraid to show everything, so the  result is a film with enough full nudity and explicit sexual content to  receive an R-rating in Canada, which would probably translate to an NC-  17 rating in the US, unfortunately. There are several scenes in the  film where you literally see every inch of skin on the bodies of the  actors (Fassbender is probably the most physically exposed). Having  said that, this is never something that comes across as frivolous and  it only enhances the film's shock factor as a whole.  Michael Fassbender delivers the performance of a lifetime in ""Shame"",  and I currently can't see anyone else winning the Oscar for Best Actor  at the upcoming Academy Awards. He seems to understand his sad, lonely  character just as well as the screenwriters who gave birth to him (Abi  Morgan and Steve McQueen). Brandon is his own worst enemy, for he longs  to find solace in someone and discover genuine human affection, but the  other side of him remains too caught up in a shameful world detached  from real feelings and emotions. There are some scenes in the film  where we, the audience, are left alone with nothing but his  introspective, subdued presence as he reflects upon his actions in  regret. These scenes say more than most movies can say within their  entirety. It's thanks to Michael Fassbender's pitch-perfect performance  that we can step into his character's shoes and get to feel what he's  feeling. They say actions speak more than words; with ""Shame"", acting  speaks more than the inclusion of any sort of narration ever would.   Don't worry; I didn't forget about Carey Mulligan! I thought I would  highlight her performance separately, too. If I had to say only one  thing about it, I would emphasize how amazed I was at seeing her in  such an unusual, singular role. She has a tendency to play soft-spoken,  prim and proper characters-- but that's not the case with ""Shame"". She  really submerges herself into this disastrous, uncontrollable mess of a  young woman who never conceals her deepest feelings to the world-- be  it joy or sorrow. There's this one very memorable scene in the film  where she sings her own rendition of the jazz standard ""New York, New  York"" in a lounge (she's a singer who does gigs here and there), and  for the duration of the song, the camera stays focused on her face.  There are no cuts nor camera movements for a good five minutes (of  course, this won't come as a big shock to you if you have seen Steve  McQueen's ""Hunger""), yet somehow, this scene is absolutely  mesmerizing-- almost hypnotizing. Just the way she naturally glances  about apprehensively as this beautiful voice is unleashed (although it  probably isn't hers) is enough to send shivers down your spine.  What can I say about all the other aspects of the film? Well, since  Steve McQueen was the man behind the direction and shot composition,  it's no big surprise that ""Shame"" is expertly crafted in every little  detail. McQueen used the same cinematographer (Sean Bobbitt) and editor  (Joe Walker) of his first feature to achieve the same impressive  aesthetic look. Some parts of the film must have required so much time  and effort from the editor, it's hard to believe what was accomplished!  As for the cinematography, I'm sure you'll be floored by it within the  first five minutes of the film. In this opening scene, Brandon finds  himself staring at a woman sitting across from him as he is riding the  subway. He misunderstands her frightened glances and nervous attempts  to display her wedding ring as romantic advances, so when she gets off  in a panic at the next stop, he immediately follows her. In one of the  most beautiful, gliding shots I've ever witnessed-- with an emotionally  shattering musical composition by Harry Escott playing all throughout--  we see Brandon running up the station stairs and looking around for the  woman, only to realize that she had run away from him. His failure to  comprehend human interactions in this scene already gives us a distinct  perception on this poor character's serious vulnerability.  In sum, Steve McQueen's ""Shame"" is a masterful character study with  top- grade performances from Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan and  a raw power unmatched by any other film I've seen. This is surely not a  film for everyone, as it deals with dark, gritty topics often labeled  as far too controversial for the big screen. But if you're open to true  cinema, here's a devastating powerhouse of a film that will chill you  to the bone and forever stay with you.",/review/rw2750853/?ref_=tt_urv
