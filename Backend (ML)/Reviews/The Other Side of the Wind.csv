14 May 2003,barnabyrudge,," Accomplished espionage thriller.
","The Saint has been criticised vociferously since its release in 1997. In some reviews, it has even been likened to The Avengers as one of the most misguided movies of all-time. However, I genuinely cannot see why this film has aroused so much dismay among the cinema going public. As far as I'm concerned, this is an accomplished, rousing and satisfyingly complex espionage thriller.",/review/rw2480682/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2000,Rammstein-2,7," Am I the only one to like it?
","I liked this movie. Not as ""The Saint"" but as an elaborate action movie with a twist. Val Kilmer bears nothing in him that even gets close to Roger Moore's character - but if you look away from that and try to see it as an ordinary film, it's really good.",/review/rw2480682/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2001,Doylenf,," Cloak-and-Dagger espionage gets lift from Val Kilmer's clever performance...
","If you expect 'The Saint' to resemble the TV series with Roger Moore, or going further back, the films with George Sanders or Tom Conway, you're in for a disappointment. Like 'Mission Impossible' (the movie), it bears no such resemblance to previous 'Saint' films.",/review/rw2480682/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2004,dcobbimdb,," Pleasantly surprised
","Maybe my expectations were too low going in after reading a slue of terrible reviews, but I thought it was a good solid movie and very entertaining. Val Kilmer was great in his disguises and rolls. Elisabeth Shue was attractive as ever and played her part well. The movie kept on a continual pace, and kept the action and suspense throughout. There were a few things I thought were lame and it got a little unrealistic at times, but all in all it was a good solid movie. Maybe even a good action / romance date movie. If you haven't seen it (as I hadn't until today), give it a try. It has action, suspense, romance, and a little comedy thrown in for good measure. It runs in at just about 2 hours long, so long enough to get a good plot, some twists & turns and yet not bore you. There will always be people that pick plot holes in movies and just love proving that it's road kill. If you're one of those people, maybe you should stay away, but if you want a good entertaining popcorn movie it's worth a watch.",/review/rw2480682/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2006,gavin6942,8," As Far As I Know, Val Kilmer's Best Role Ever
","I've always thought of Val Kilmer as a secondary actor. Iceman in ""Top Gun"" and playing a second-rate Batman compared to Michael Keaton. But I was proved wrong in ""The Saint"", which pushes acting to the limit with Kilmer playing a variety of characters very well, and also having romantic and action scenes.",/review/rw2480682/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2007,thinker1691,9," The Saint walks Among Us
","Back in the sixties Roger Moore don the persona of Simon Templar, known to his fans as The Saint. From the small tube to the Silver Screen, our hero has arisen to a modern audience. With the superb talents of Val Kilmer, the saint is out to accomplish two goals. First he attempts to secure his life-long ambition of amassing $1 billion dollars, and second to perform three miracles. In the process, he encounters both friends and life threatening villains. In this episode, the Saint attempts to save the crumbling Soviet Empire' energy supply, by revamping the scientific and long sought-after formula of Cold Fusion. In this story, he helps brainy, Dr. Lev Botvin, (Henry Goodman) perfect the celebrated formula of Physist Emma Russell, (Elisabeth Shue). The re-energized formula will replenish Russia's dwindling energy and save the Premiere of Russia from the anti-government villains played adroitly by (Rade Serbedzija), Ivan Tretiak, (Valeri Nikolayev) and Vereshagin (Michael Byrne), the archenemies of Templar. Alun Armstrong is believable as Inspector Teal. The film is fast paced and action oriented with plenty of drama, guns, explosions and international intrigue. Kilmer is fantastic and I believe this will become a classic among all the great films of his career. ****",/review/rw2480682/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2012,MartynGryphon,8," Why did they make this a Saint movie?
","I'm a massive fan of all things Saintly. I have read all the Saint books, I own and have seen all the old RKO Saint movies from the 30's, 40's and 50's with Louis Hayward, George Sanders and Hugh Sinclair and own all the TV episodes from the 60's & 70's with Roger Moore & Ian Ogilvy. Only a few Saint items elude me. The very hard to find Simon Dutton Saint adventures from the late 80's, the Andrew Clarke one off TV Movie from 1987, the old radio shows from he 40's and 50's and the forgettable French movies of the 60's.",/review/rw2480682/?ref_=tt_urv

","The movie deal with Ivan Tretiak ( Rade Serbedzja ) and his son ( Nikolayev ), Russian Mafia chiefs who want to create an oil crisis in Moscow and seize power as a result . They agree Simon Templar ( Val Kilmer ) , -master of disguises and great international criminal- , and send him to Oxford to steal a secret formula for cold fusion from U.S. scientist Emma Russell ( Elisabeth Shue ) who cooked up the recipe .

20 March 2004,Crewgrrl20,," A guilty pleasure
","I love this movie.  As a movie buff, I must admit, objectively, this is a bad movie.  The writing is ridiculous, the plot is convoluted, and Val Kilmer's accents are bizarre.  But I love this movie.  It is that wonderful combination of danger and romance that makes for great fantasy.  The chemistry between Kilmer and Shue holds this movie together.  It is a delight to watch them realize that their skin deep attraction goes much deeper.  If you can suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the ride, the Saint is a fun movie.  Despite its flaws, the Saint is a guilty pleasure to indulge in when your own life is lacking in explosions, gun fights, and sudden, passionate romances.",/review/rw2480682/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2013,SnoopyStyle,5," James Bond with ugly disguises

16 October 2004,Lotts,10," Val Kilmer's performance is incredible
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film and not just because of Val Kilmer's accomplishment at successfully being eye-candy, but also because of the amazing personality transformations his character goes through in front of the mirror. The story line itself is pretty impressive and I loved that although it keeps you guessing, you don't end up wondering, ""What the hell is going on?' The science side is played down enough for the audience to know it's there but not to get distracted by its details. I don't know if the theory actually works, but after watching the film I don't really care - that isn't the point of the movie.",/review/rw2480682/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2001,TxMike,," Adequately entertaining romantic action movie, Val Kilmer and Elisabeth Shue, ""7"" of 10.
","Some spoilers. I saw ""The saint"" on network TV, so it may have had a bit edited out. The beginning didn't totally make sense to me, however Simon (Val Kilmer) had a bad experience in a Catholic orphanage, escaped with his clever use of his ""bag of tricks"", and as an adult became a thief using a number of different saint names, thus the title of the film. His love interest is Emma (Elisabeth Shue), a PhD with the correct formula for cold fusion, but also with a heart condition requiring medication.",/review/rw2480682/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2019,Calicodreamin,5," Ridiculously cliche
","Val Kilmer does a good job playing his different roles and accents. The action isn't too bad, but it's mostly chasing rather than hand to hand or shootout. The interactions between Kilmer and Shue were ridiculously cliche. She meets some drifter, falls in love, and even after he steals her life's work, she chases him all over the place. It's almost hard to watch. The plot was a little convoluted, and felt repetitive.",/review/rw2480682/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2000,Shawshank Sam,," VAL KILMER AT HIS BEST
",As I'm not someone who is very familiar with the television show I'm guessing that it was a plus. The film was a complete entity without having to rely on the show of the same name.,/review/rw2480682/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2005,jackie-107,8," Return of an icon
","I watched this on TV out of nostalgic remembrance of the classic TV Saint series with Roger Moore which I grew up with in the 1960s. Not expecting similarity but hoping for some swashbuckling action in Simon Templar style, I was not disappointed. A thoroughly enjoyable Saturday evening viewing with a stylish Val Kilmer (an actor I'm not familiar with) who combined the Templar characteristics with James Bond finesse very well, and a cute Elizabeth Shue playing her part in the manner of the unlikely earlier Saint female leads (I've never seen a mini-skirted, sexy blonde scientific genius in all my years spent in Oxford!) but adding her own feisty zest to the proceedings.",/review/rw2480682/?ref_=tt_urv

20 July 2006,ccthemovieman-1,7," An 'MI' Type Story & Pretty Good, Too
","This reminded me a lot of ""Mission Impossible,"" which had been a hit movie the year before this film was released. It, too, had a complex plot and a lot of foreign intrigue and accents. I don't think it's as good as MI, but it's not bad and definitely deserves a look, or two or three!",/review/rw2480682/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2004,GOWBTW,," SAINTLY,A CLEVER MOVIE!
","This movie is more of the modern day version of ""Robin Hood"", only without the bow and arrows. Val Kilmer, plays the role very well. To me in my opinion is no Batman, but he does provide a lot of action in this movie. Simon Templar is more than just a ""saint"", he's a chameleon in the process.",/review/rw2480682/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 1999,Gary-93,10," I'm Sorry, I liked it
","Well I've read some comments here and I have to say I loved the film, but if asked what I thought of it I normally just say ""I quite liked it"" when really I've seen it an unhealthy number of times. I really liked it, and I'm not really sorry.",/review/rw2480682/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 1999,JEC64,10," Beautiful
","This is one of those movies that is strictly for the eye. The soundtrack by Graeme Revell was brilliant, Elizabeth Shue is absolutely stunning. In the apartment scene her eyes shine in diamond hazel colors. It was just a simply movie, decent acting, but there was something about it. It captured an essence, I can't actually describe it, it was actually corny and beautiful at the same time.",/review/rw2480682/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2014,Prismark10,5," A halo-less hero
",The Saint is a Robin Hood type criminal character devised by Leslie Charteris a Chinese Singaporean.

28 July 2012,JohnHowardReid,6," Leslie Charteris Would Probably Like This Movie
","Yes, Leslie Charteris would probably like this movie -- but not me. The way I see The Saint is much the way George Sanders and Louis Hayward interpreted him. A debonair scourge of spies and criminals, The Saint steps in where the official police are afraid to tread or unable to investigate. Now there is nothing debonair about Val Kilmer. Nothing particularly likable either -- except for the fact that he bests the villains and can run fast. I don't blame the heroine for being confused, for The Saint himself -- as presented here -- is a confusing character. The script even takes time out to let us know WHY he is confused. It all happened in his childhood, see, when he was a victimized Oliver Twist in an orphanage -- but not just an ordinary orphanage. As I pointed out in other reviews, many modern movies are determined to throw off the shackles of the past and come out fighting mad. In this case, it's the Catholic Church that gets a firm drubbing with a sadistic priest presented as a fiend from hell. These childhood episodes really have little to do with the main action but are presented mainly for their shock value. The film, which is a mite too long at 112 minutes away, would be better off without them. Introduce Kilmer right from the start and you would have a more compact, less talkative and far more suspenseful movie.",/review/rw2480682/?ref_=tt_urv

28 August 2011,tieman64,," Hitchcockian ""running man"" movie
","Phillip Noyce excels at directing spy thrillers (""Patriot Games"", ""Clear and Present Danger"", ""The Quiet American"", ""Salt""). With ""The Saint"" he tells the tale of Simon Templar (Val Kilmer), a master of disguise and professional thief who finds himself dodging the police, Scotland Yard and Russian bad-guys. At his side is a sexy but fragile electro-chemist played by Elizabeth Shue, who hopes to keep the secrets of cold fusion out of the hands evil oil baron, Ivan Treitiak.",/review/rw2480682/?ref_=tt_urv
