8 June 2021,realalexrice,10," Hypnotic and misunderstood
","Initially was at a loss for words with this one. I can't necessarily explain the feelings this film brings out, but I can say they feel real personal and there's just something so off yet so painfully real about (most of) this movie and it is just really undervalued in Kubrick's filmography, I think. Besides being one of my favorite looking movies ever, the midpoint turn is one of the scariest heading down rabbit hole reveals I've really encountered in a film and it just disturbed me for the entire time (you know the point) and after as it continued provocatively building to the disturbing and bizarrely cathartic ending, which haunts me as the final scene in a Kubrick film. It's perfect in it's imperfectness and I get an insane level of both joy and sadness watching this movie.",/review/rw0451821/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2020,dustinkdye,10," What did Kubrick want us to open our eyes to?
","Eyes Wide Shut is a movie like Casablanca or The Wizard of Oz (which is subtly referenced in the film) in that the more times you view it, the more you get out of it. (I imagine at some point you would wring out all the meaning, but that would take scores of viewings.) One infamous scene is so over-the-top it is easy to miss all the subtle references in the film, which necessitates multiple viewings. Fair warning--the more times you watch it, the more you go down the rabbit hole Kubrick digs (a reference to Alice in Wonderland, also evoked in Eyes Wide Shut).",/review/rw0451821/?ref_=tt_urv

","Stanley Kubrick was tempted to do ""Eyes Wide Shut"" in 1970, but Christianne, his wife, felt that her marriage could be in jeopardy, so she implored him not to do it... But ""Eyes Wide Shut"" came to be after all, the last temptation of Kubrick...",/review/rw0451821/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 1999,niteman,9," An impressive film with a bad marketing campaign
","Eyes Wide Shut is ill-suited for the summer movie corridor.  It has no explosions, no running, shouting, or a single gunshot.  What it has are long scenes in which characters talk to one another.  Slowly and carefully.  The problem is that the film is marketed as having white-hot sex scenes and plenty of gratuitous nudity, while it has neither.  There is plenty of naked flesh, don't get me wrong, but in exactly the opposite way that the ads make it appear.  This is not a movie about being sexy and naked -- it's a movie about how flesh is just another part of being human, so what is all the fuss about?  The marketing campaign is misleading, and led to disappointment in the audience that I saw the movie with, who were just looking for some skin.",/review/rw0451821/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 1999,Jaime N. Christley,9," Remarkable finale to a long, glorious career
","The thing a lot of folks haven't liked about Stanley Kubrick's films is the fact that he always seemed to think the audience needed some points driven home a little harder than others.  Very little is left for debate; most everything is spelled out, pressed hard, and dwelled upon.  His critics have compared the long waits between his films to the long periods of waiting that occur while watching his films.",/review/rw0451821/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2005,JFHunt,10," Kubrick's Gift to us all. ""I have seen one or two things in my life but never, never anything like this.""
","I'm sitting here trying to come up with a clever comment about this movie to make you want to see it. When in reality it doesn't matter what I say. As Stallone would say ""I'm at least half a bum."" The truth to it is, it kind of makes me sad that I'll probably never see another movie that affects so much. Never experience a film that 6 years after it's release, I still can not forget.",/review/rw0451821/?ref_=tt_urv

","After three years of waiting, EYES WIDE SHUT has finally come out.  So now after all this time, the delays, the rumors, the teases, the sad death of its director, Stanley Kubrick, we finally get to answer the question, Does it live up to the hype?  For the first time this year, the answer to that question is a resounding yes.  This is, so far, the best film I've seen this year, and it deserves its place among other Kubrick masterpieces like DR. STRANGELOVE, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.",/review/rw0451821/?ref_=tt_urv

8 December 2009,murtaza_mma,10," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Kubrick's swan song, and arguably his greatest
","Stanley Kubrick is unarguably Anglo-American cinema's most potent reply to the 'Fellinis', the 'Bunuels', the 'Bergmans', the 'Kurosawas', the 'Rays', and the 'Tarkovskys' of the world. Ubiquitously known for his inexorable yearning for perfection and uncanny innovation, Kubrick had managed to hold millions of viewers worldwide in a transfixion through his brilliant works for well over four decades. Regarded by Kubrick as his very best, Eyes Wide Shut is incredibly brilliant and sui generis. It's an elixir for the sore eyes; a panacea for the perturbed souls; a surreally psychedelic pleasure. Like most of his avant-garde works, Eyes Wide Shut is open to speculation and can be interpreted in a number of ways. ",/review/rw0451821/?ref_=tt_urv

22 November 2015,CinemaClown,," The Final Masterpiece From The Greatest Filmmaker Of All Time
","From the director behind influential masterpieces like The Killing, Paths of Glory, Spartacus, Lolita, Dr. Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining & Full Metal Jacket, Eyes Wide Shut marks the final entry in the decades-spanning, unprecedented & extraordinary filmmaking career of Stanley Kubrick. And just like all of his reappraised works, is a classic that unveils more of its intricate layers on multiple viewings.",/review/rw0451821/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 1999,pooch-8,," Compelling, complex observation of fidelities and fantasies
","With the exception of a late-occurring scene of deadening over-explanation wholly unnecessary to the film on every level (and rather unusual for Kubrick), Eyes Wide Shut is utterly sensational, and represents another gleaming jewel in the master filmmaker's already studded crown.  Cruise and Kidman surpass all of their previous work, turning in spectacular performances infused with nuances only hinted at prior to this outing. Their real-life union appears to bring every bit of unique tension Kubrick intended, as the movie wholly depends on the verisimilitude of the central couple's relationship.  Kubrick's tone fulfills all the promise of the title, consistently delivering an elevated texture of almost uncanny imagination perpetually hovering between fantasy and reality.  The director additionally mines many of his familiar thematic concerns, including deceit, paranoia, and blinding frustration.  Eyes Wide Shut is certain to be as closely scrutinized as many of Kubrick's other films (particularly because it is his final work), and its thoughtful and challenging treatment of such lightning-rod topics as marital honesty, sexual jealousy, and the perceived risks of disclosing one's fantasies (even to the single person you trust more than any other) is sure to draw some people in while pushing others away.",/review/rw0451821/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2012,AlexDeLargeisHere,10," Eyes Wide Open
","Stanley Kubrick's final film is perhaps the first of its kind: it is the only film I have watched that exists within the state of death itself. It's no surprise; Stanley Kubrick died 4 days after submitting the final print into Warner Bros., Sydney Pollock died in 2008 and my grandparents, who saw this film at a screening in 1999, are dead. However, these aren't merely the reasons this film evokes a death-like state, this film evokes a death-like state throughout Bill Harford's sexual odyssey. During the Masonic orgy, which is arguably the film's center-piece, women are used and discarded as corpses who are only valued for their material gain. This film is shroud in ultra-violet blue, especially at the end of the film where it accentuates the characters' trembling flesh and vulnerable humanity, and the powerful red which contrasts against this blue reflects one of Kubrick's favorite themes: dominance. Perhaps it's inexplicable that Eyes Wide Shut evokes a man's dying thoughts. Ironically, this film feels more fresh and timeless than many of its contemporaries, only reaffirming the inestimable value of Kubrick's contributions to cinema and a decade of a cinematic drought aptly followed his death. It was fashionable to deride Stanley Kubrick's final film during its theatrical run, regardless of the fact that he considered it his personal favorite. It seems that the audience expected Kubrick to inundate them with gratuitous eroticism as opposed to ideas. Yet, Eyes Wide Shut has outsmarted time and the film industry itself. It was almost incongruously released a week before American Pie and the abysmal Will Smith star vehicle Wild Wild West. It continues to hold a mere 7.2/10 on IMDb in contrast to escapist science-fiction film The Matrix which holds an 8.7/10 rating and is listed in the top 30 films of all time, above Kubrick's more cerebral science-fiction classic 2001: A Space Odyssey. All of this may be due to the fact that Kubrick argued that 'Observancy is a dying art' and Eyes Wide Shut requires an attention to detail and an attention span that transcends the average summer blockbuster; it's easy to get lost in the terrifying labyrinth of Kubrick's musings. Though, unlike other films, Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut refutes the transcendent imagery and magic that is featured in the majority of Kubrick's films, even in Eyes Wide Shut itself, and strips humanity down to its fragile human core, figuratively speaking; Kubrick comes to the conclusion that when man is confronted with the cold and harsh reality, he favors comforting self-delusion and blissful ignorance.",/review/rw0451821/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,TheLittleSongbird,8," Kubrick's swansong his most underrated?
","In my opinion, I think it is. Not his best mind you, I personally would put 2001, Clockwork Orange, Dr Strangelove, Full Metal Jacket and Barry Lyndon over Eyes Wide Shut, but while I haven't seen it in quite some time and have been meaning to revisit it I remember not being particularly impressed with Fear and Desire.",/review/rw0451821/?ref_=tt_urv

17 July 1999,Skywise-4,10," A fitting completion to Kubrick's study of humanity
","I managed to swallow my expectations before the film, setting myself to judge it on its own without judging it as a Kubrick film. No need, no need! This film IS a Kubrick film, without any doubt, and as all Kubrick films are it was absolutely stunning. Absolutely. Visually it is brilliant, though I should warn that this isn't quite as visual a film as most other Kubrick works. A lot of the film focuses on the characters, on human interaction, something rather new to this director. Of course, all the Kubrick trademarks are there, cold analytical gazes, sharp introspection. Tom Cruise seems like Jack Nicholson in 'The Shining' and even Malcolm MacDowell in 'A Clockwork Orange' at times, a rather striking fact considering that this is Tom Cruise. The performances were excellent all around, even from places not expected. Again, this is typical for Kubrick. He wasn't much of a people director, but he still knew how to direct people.",/review/rw0451821/?ref_=tt_urv

10 August 2010,planktonrules,7," I know this makes me a heretic, but this film should have had at least half an hour trimmed.
","It's amazing that a film this long and drawn out would actually leave so much unsaid and unclear. What's also amazing is that although I am a huge cinemaniac, I am willing to dare to say that the god of cinema snobs, Stanley Kubrick, made a film that was far from perfect. The bottom line is that although the plot was very interesting, the film was simply too low energy, too long and too over-stylized.",/review/rw0451821/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2016,Leofwine_draca,7," Way too long, but it's a fitting swansong for Kubrick
","Kubrick's final film turns out to be both disappointing and spellbinding, but thankfully the spellbinding part far outweighs the disappointing bit. Despite the massive hype, many critics were unkind to this film, labelling it wishy-washy and insubstantial. While I agree that it is definitely flawed, there are some excellent scenes in the film which rival those of any creepy horror film.",/review/rw0451821/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2000,tedg,," Lucid Dreaming
","Kubrick is hard for me to get, and this film in particular. From my research, it seems as if he is one of those filmmakers who sees himself as a storyteller, with little desire to explore the limits of film as film. That's common enough and at root not very interesting. But Kubrick tries to be an innovator within that relatively narrow context by examining novel ways of telling his story.",/review/rw0451821/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2021,cagebox111,9," A Fantastically Tense Film - Kubrick's Commentary on Sex
","Kubrick's last movie is not an all-time classic like some of his other films, but Eyes Wide Shut is a fantastic movie nonetheless. It starts off a little slow but the tension builds gradually and reaches its climax when Cruise's character enters the party his friend Nick invites him to. That scene, both unexpected and amazingly tense, is among the most effect and captivating scenes in Kubrick's career and really makes the movie. Once Cruise leaves the party the tension continues as he deals with the aftermath of what he saw which leads to an ending that is up to the viewer to interpret. I would have preferred some more firm answers but from reading the synopsis of the novel on which this movie is based, it ends similarly ambiguously. Regardless of just how evil the group at the party was, the atmosphere created by Kubrick is chilling and effective and the movie stayed with me hours after viewing.",/review/rw0451821/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2009,moonspinner55,2," Kubrick's cop-out: there's no sting in the writing, and hardly a chill in the air...
","""Eyes Wide Shut"" looks great but never comes together. It has an impossibly long build-up which strives to tell us that a wealthy, seemingly happy married couple have cracks in their facade, which sends the husband ""out into the night"". Filmmaker Stanley Kubrick has shown tremendous talent with his actors, but even this auteur can't break through Tom Cruise's candy-coated shell (the movie is all about masks, but Cruise is wearing the biggest one, that of a movie star who can't escape his own inhibitions). Nicole Kidman is perhaps better, but her role is extremely weak (Kubrick has never had much affinity for his women). Does the picture hope to shock? To provoke? Is it a psychological thriller or a voyeur's fantasy? It seems to struggle with all these ingredients. In the end, it is mostly just dull and slow, one final glimpse of Kubrick revering himself and the potency of the heterosexual male. * from ****",/review/rw0451821/?ref_=tt_urv
