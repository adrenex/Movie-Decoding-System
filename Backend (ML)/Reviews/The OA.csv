5 August 2016,neil-476,2," Utter drivel and, what's worse, boring drivel.
","This film starts promisingly with an eye-catching and unsettling image: then the first dialogue (or should I say ""direlogue""?) scene starts, and two things happen. One, the dialogue is awful. Two, the instruction in Acting 101 ""Make the most of your pauses"" has been translated here into ""Leave 5 seconds silence before replying to anything which has been said."" The self-consciously clever-dick direction, at its worst, leads to an interminable sequence which is supposed to represent a catwalk show in which nothing happens (and it doesn't happen repetitively, too) for what seems to be half a day. Refn thinks he is being clever in his direction: he isn't.",/review/rw3646472/?ref_=tt_urv

Really, this film is about obsession, loneliness, fear and the crippling tension of being on constant guard against the attack of predators. Alone and vulnerable in Los Angeles, Jesse (Elle Fanning) is a skittish prey animal surrounded by the dangers of the urban jungle.

30 December 2016,Rickting,9," A work of art
","I cannot understand all the hatred for this movie. Nicolas Winding Refn bounces back from Only God Forgives with this dark, twisted and nightmarish horror film about a young model in Los Angeles who attracts fascination and unwanted attention from the modelling industry and her fellow models. Admittedly, it's only a good movie on a story level. The plot is relatively thin and the characters are underdeveloped. As a piece of art it's an utter knockout. Every single frame is a painting and every image advances the story forward and creates new meaning. This isn't a narrative film. It's a film to experience and to be amazed by. This is a rare movie where being style-over-substance is brilliant because the style is the substance. The artistic mastery on display here takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions. This movie will have you feeling joyous one moment and terrified the next. The soundtrack is absolutely flawless as well. Elle Fanning is great and all the actors do a good job with their limited dialogue. Even Keanu Reeves is decent in this movie. A flawed masterpiece, The Neon Demon is a mesmerizing, hypnotic and mind-blowing cinematic nightmare that stands high above most of 2016's other films, even though quite a lot of people disliked it.

13 November 2020,jayjaycee,7," Visually disturbing descent into an abyss of beauty and envy
","""The Neon Demon"" is a 2016 horror thriller directed by Nicolas Winding Refn starring Elle Fanning and Jena Malone.
⚪
All in all, this dazzling Nicolas Winding Refn feature captivatingly parades on a gloomy catwalk of beau ideals, obsession with slenderness and unadulterated envy, and even if there are some weaknesses concerning pace and plot, the bizarrely hypnotic imagery, taciturn but distinct performances and an indescribably unnerving score make for a subliminally ruthless and subtly disturbing, fluorescent fever dream that impressively and radically exposes the mercilessness and perfidy of being a glamorous model.
⚪
After many of my fellow cinephiles have told me that this NWR is slightly underrated and didn't deserve any of the hate it has received from critics, I thought that it was a must watch for me. Honestly, I didn't know what I was in for. All I knew was that the director of the brilliantly cruising drama ""Drive"" directed Elle Fanning in a bizarre thriller about models and fashion. Basically, that's the gist of the film, but how it was executed was what had an impact on me. Once again, I can comprehend why one might dislike it, because the Danish director's style is anything but ordinary, and only when you can appreciate it, you will find a gem with this film. Yes, it is absolutely unconventional, and this concept shows itself in all facets of this odd feature. First of all, I would like to point out Elle Fanning who scintillates in one of her first leading roles. At the age of only sixteen (yes, when shooting started she was underaged!), she managed to capture the vulnerability, insecurity and innocence of her character extremely convincingly, and it is her who, in fact, carries most of the film with her performance. She plays the juvenile Jesse who tries to become a fashion model, and, thanks to her often-referred natural beauty, eventually manages to get into the business, what, of course, inadvertently makes her make enemies. Well, what admittedly sounds like a generic reality TV show ends up being a distressing nightmare. What else did you expect from the dude who made ""Drive""? Light fare? As the tag line on many advertisements state, beauty is the only thing, and the film follows this premise in one of the most disturbing and ominous ways possible. Gradually, Jesse succeeds in the business and is more and more consumed by vanity, egoism and arrogance, and the shy little girl from the beginning is gone completely in the end. And I mean, literally. It wouldn't be a work of NWR if it wasn't grotesque, but before I'll talk about the outrageous final act, I want to point out the equally dark undertones preceding it as well. As you might have noticed, I have purposely remarked on several occasions that Jesse is merely sixteen years old. You may ask why, and I am going to tell you: In many scenes the young girl is exposed to misconduct of all kinds. From her best friend who tries to hit on her, over a photographer who forces her to undress in order to lubricate her with golden paint, to a make-up artist trying to rape her, there is all, including Keanu Reeves as a shady motel owner who contributes a little perversity as well. I for one was shocked to see that Refn in fact depicted all those scenes despite the actor and the character being a minor, but then I came to the conclusion that it is not even as unworldly as I thought. I might not have been a model myself (wait, I have been once, but I was a kid), but I know how hideous and unpredictable humans can be. The real world is merciless and hard-hearted, especially to young women. That's why I thought that the scandalous things depicted in here are as shocking as they are realistic, and that wasn't even all. Right under the surface of this apparently shallow film seethes a callous conflict, and how Refn does criticise the business deserves major respect. Almost casually, by short and rushed lines of dialogue, he subliminally expresses his extreme criticism on the entire industry. When a perverse photographer touches a minor, a company chef fires a candidate without looking at her or when an opponent model proudly brags about her plastic surgery, there is this intense feeling of disgust, and its always palpable. By the example of Jesse, he wants to show the severe conflict of ""natural beauty vs. artificial beauty"" and how the two extremes act accordingly. As she is becoming more and more successful, the protagonist falls for egotism, and the once humble girl turns into an condescending little princess. The curious thing about this film is how this development takes place, and that is how I also come to my first point of criticism. There is zero to little dialogue in this film, and the intensity is primarily carried by its disturbing and bizarre imagery, and even if it is possible that a film can in fact succeed doing this (see ""Portrait Of A Lady On Fire"") it is a risky thing to do. This one here is not always on point, and the inconsistency amazes me. Many sequences are exciting yet bland, impressive yet unimposing, vacuous yet meaningful. You know what I mean? At the same time, I grasp what he wants to state and have no clue about what he wants to tell me. It showcases raw emotions, feelings and simultaneously it keeps its distance which in turn keeps me from finding a deep connection to both the characters or the story. There is a certain intensity this film causes, but I wonder how it would have haunted me even more if it had been, in fact, closer. You know what I mean? Well, therefore the final act compensated this feeling, because it is downright shocking! True to the motto ""pride comes before a fall"" Jesse pays the price for her arrogance by, well, falling. As if the necrophilia depicted before wasn't dreadful enough, cannibalism comes into the play as well. After she has neglected or outdone them, her former friend and two peers decide to kill her ... and then eat her and bath in her blood as well. I was like ""What in the actual hell?"" only to be reminded that it just perfectly rounds up the alleged exaggeratedness Refn accuses the industry of. And in the final scene, when one of the cannibalistic models throws up Jesse's undigested eye and kills herself, and her friend picks up and eats it without batting an eye, the preposterousness has reached its climax. Before you are able to ask questions, the credits roll and leave you completely disgusted and shattered. In the end, it is one of those odd, crazy and unusual films that were never meant to be mainstream films. It is pure independent cinema and definitely not everyone's pair of shoes, but what did you expect from Nicolas Winding Refn? I for one was able to find a liking to this unconventional work, and even if it has its obvious flaws, it left a severe impact on me.",/review/rw3646472/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2017,eagandersongil,8," Perfection through the death of naturalness
","Luxuria, Glamor, Envy, Perfection, Ego, Narcissism and more ... ""Demon of Neon"" finds the point and explores the world of perfect human beings, where naturalness shocks, and robotic is accepted, where perfection can be reflected in the mirror and where ""everything that the human being has, is its beauty"", this is the world of the film of director Nicolas Refn, a film under-appreciated by criticism and by the public, which tells a sarcastically sensational and a beautiful technical and visual. The plot of the film has a simple premise, and focuses on a linearity and the character of Jesse, but with the course, the secondary characters are gaining strength until finally steal the film. A kind of ""Black Swan"" on the contrary, because here our protagonist is already perfect, and the others around her who seek this perfection in her, with an air David Lynch and using subjectivity, ""Demon Neon"" is a spectacle, entering as far as possible into the human ego it shows that perfection goes beyond the very concept of humanity, and the search delimits the character and submits decency to nothing, the long produces and shows a world where what really counts is appearances , and he does not have to do it with dialogues, he says it in small details, like the make-up that Jesse is wearing in his moment of ""change,"" or in his parade where she kisses her appearance in a metaphor of marriage to herself, the film uses a variety of script resources, from this dialogue to subjectivity to show its idea, and after a while this becomes so natural, that Nicolas begins to introduce elements of pure savagery, such as rape, cannibalism, murder and even necrophilia, shocking? no, not at all, the shocking thing is the human indifference to savagery when your goal is to be perfect and your lust wipes out your humanity. The film technically is a very detailed, with a camera always searching the center, and a photograph that plays with games of lights, reflecting the climate of the scene, although at times, it seems that Nicolas plays with the photography of random way but nevertheless , is a very beautiful work, we also have a good track, good set that gives a very good rhythm to the film, even the same being sometimes very contemplative, a great makeup and costumes, technically, ""Devil De Neon"" is pure whim, and it's one of the most technically beautiful thriller movies I've ever seen. Elle Fannng is great in her role, and can pass the tone of innocent girl and bad girl when it is necessary, Jena Malone tabem is giant, beautiful and passing a hidden air, her character is the synthesis of the doubt, she wants the carnal perfection and sentimental, at the same time that the two are in conflict, the other actresses are robotic, even in their postures at the table, and this is not bad, is great, which proves that has no weakness in the cast. ""De Neon"" is not perfect, his moral that preaches a vision that nothing can be perfect and natural for a long time proves itself in the evaluation of the film, he can be perfect in some aspects, but his naturalness dies, and sometimes it is even a little forced, but it is still a great movie and a psychological suspense of quality, with questions, good technique, and great outcome, because this is the most dangerous thing in a movie, its end, it can ruin the work, and it seems that it will happen with ""Devil De Neon"", because it has a ready and great ending, there the film lengthens 2 more scenes, showing a final more than great, perfect, where perfection is reached, dead humanity and digested naturalness.",/review/rw3646472/?ref_=tt_urv
