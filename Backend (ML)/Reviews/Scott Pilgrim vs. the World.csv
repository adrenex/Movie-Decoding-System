8 October 2020,A_Kind_Of_CineMagic,10," Hugely positive addition to the Star Wars story.
","Clone Wars starts out as seeming like a mostly pretty lightweight bit of family entertainment with touches of the more exciting and more serious aspects of Star Wars. However, it develops to be a hugely powerful and astoundingly high quality addition to the overall story.",/review/rw5984650/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2020,vangelisj,9," What an end!!
",We have to wait almost six years to see the conclusion of an epic story! How the animation since the first season improved and how the characters were developed until now! It was beautiful and the final scene was simply sublime! üëè,/review/rw5984650/?ref_=tt_urv

","I actually stumbled on this series by accident - and what a nice surprise! While I did not see the associated animated film (because of the very bad reviews), this show seems to have some very good things going for it.",/review/rw5984650/?ref_=tt_urv

31 May 2020,EarlGenesis,9," Starts off decent but gradually develops into a masterclass of a cartoon
","The first two seasons of The Clone Wars are rather decent, but all of your interest will be completely captured once you begin S3 and onwards. The action is spectacular, the animation gets much better, the characters develop extremely well, and the story itself fits perfectly into the Star Wars story as a whole.",/review/rw5984650/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2020,zaidmnomani,8," Star Wars At It's Finest
","Star Wars the Clone Wars is set in the three years between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. The story is about the intergalactic war between the Republic and the Separatists, also known as the Clone Wars. Oddly enough it is quite important in the Prequel trilogy and and was even mentioned in A New Hope, but never fully explored. I'm glad it wasn't though, because otherwise we would never get this fantastic show.",/review/rw5984650/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2022,kaden_lewis,10," Star Wars: The Clone Wars
","I decided to watch Star Wars for the first time in March if 2021. I wanted to watch it in timeline order, and watch all the cartoons as well. I am so happy I did. With the exception of Star Wars Resistance, they were great. But out of all the Star Wars I watched, I spent the most time with the clone wars. That is because it is so long, but it made me make a connection with the show, and some of the characters who aren't really in the movies. It is definitely my favorite animated show, and it is also one of my favorite shows all time.",/review/rw5984650/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2021,paul_haakonsen,8," Rather enjoyable...
","Right, well back in the day when ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" initially came out, I managed to sit through two seasons before giving up on the series. Why? Well, as much of a ""Star Wars"" fan as I am, then the animation and art style was just a bitter pill to swallow, and I never really been a fan of the Clone Wars era in the ""Star Wars"" universe.",/review/rw5984650/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2008,mixta110,10," Bloody Brilliant! At last Star Wars is back, and its good again!
","Well, after a sceptical start with the clone wars animated movie, the actual TV series is getting better and better. Slightly bumpy start however. (Droid voices????) But as the ""Shadow of malevolence storyline unfolds, it is clear that Star Wars is back in star wars territory. Great little storyline, and episode 3 is just true to the spirit of the original Trilogy and yet keeps with the clone wars setting. Episodes 4 & 5 are even better, and as a listener to the podcasts on theforce.net the interviews are brilliant too. The creators are aware of what we like and don't and they reassure us not to worry, as some very cool stuff is still in the pipeline. ",/review/rw5984650/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2018,joseph_the_broseph,," Pretty darn good for a ""kid's show""
","Before I start, let me clarify: I am not a six-year old writing this based on watching seven episodes from Season 1. This is my favorite show and I have memorized every episode. So, let's get started!
This show is simple- it is, to put it in concise terms, a series of events happening between episodes 2 and 3 of the prequels. 
This show shows the progression of how the writers and animators weren't afraid to try new things after a while. 
Season 1 of this show is sort of dull. As I said, the creators weren't very brave at this point, and didn't really know what crossed the line. Soon, of course, they found out: THERE IS NO LINE. There are a few good episodes in the season, getting better as it comes to a close. But overall, it was just flashy lights and big noises- your typical kid's show. 
Season 2 is where they started accelerating, in terms of creativity. They made their first four-episode story arc, and made some pretty darn good standalones. ""Cat and Mouse"" was a particular favorite of mine.
Season 3 is where they really started putting some good stuff into the show. There was a lot more commentary, and the show got pretty intellectual and actually got older audiences thinking. The last few episodes of the season are where they really show their transition. The animators changed their style, and a lot of things changed, but I loved the change in the Jedi's clothing style and the beginning of this new, smarter, creative show that the people behind this masterpiece had just started.
Season 4 is where it gets great. What surprised me was the amount of violence. Clone Wars was no longer a show for seven year olds. Now it was a show for twelve and thirteen year olds, and for the parents watching too. They came up with some great stories, including ""Obi-Wan goes undercover,"" ""Water Wars"", ""General Krell,"" and of course, the revival of Darth frickin' Maul. That's right. They bring back Darth Maul. 
Anyway, Season 5 was all four-part arcs. (On the DVD version, Revival is right before Shades of Reason.) These were very interesting stories. The first arc, for example, is a strange meld of the American Revolution and the Vietnam War, as Jedi go to train people on another planet, who are looking to overthrow their tyrant ruler, King Rash. Sometimes, the arcs get too lighthearted (Like the one with R2-D2 and the frog colonel) but overall it was a good season, with an astonishingly beautiful, sad, and open ending.
Season 6 is where they just went nuts. Clone Wars was not on TV anymore, so they could do whatever they wanted. And the episodes in Season 6 went from Fives investigating something in the genetic code of the clones, to Anakin and Obi-Wan looking for clues as to the mysterious death of Sifo-Dyas. Great season. 
Anyway, ",/review/rw5984650/?ref_=tt_urv

15 April 2022,POIguy,9," Has epic highs but also embarassing lows
","When The Clone Wars is at its best, it is quite possibly the best the Star Wars franchise has to offer. This show has some epic arcs, such as the Umbara arc, the Seige of Mandalore, and the Mortis arc. Storylines like these expand the lore of Star Wars and offer engaging and thrilling stories to latch onto. Unfortunately, the Clone Wars also has some not so thrilling arcs (basically anything to do with Jar-Jar or driods). I'm not sure why these arcs were put in here, but they ruin the show from being a 10/10. Other than these boring arcs, the rest of the show is fantastic. It's a show that's great for both kids and adults which is quite rare.",/review/rw5984650/?ref_=tt_urv

","It looks like Star Wars, sounds like Star Wars and feels like Star Wars. I was surprised to see that someone else actually understood Star Wars, because so far no one other than the creator has. Upon watching the special features I learned why. George Lucas is involved with everything. Go figure.",/review/rw5984650/?ref_=tt_urv

","While it's true that Season 1 and the Clone Wars Film were hard to get into, each Season of Clone Wars felt more and more engaging to a point where Seasons 3-6 gave us many of the most classic Star Wars we remember today. Excellent Villains, Excellent Heroes, Perfect Tie In's and expansions on the Star Wars Universe, Gorgeous Animation, Excellent Voice Acting and some of the most passionate and well crafted writing of anything else like it makes this one of the greatest animated TV Shows of all time.",/review/rw5984650/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2011,illbebackreviews,8," Star Wars Is Back Once More, Better Than Ever :D!!
","Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2003) was a series that was brilliantly made, and to be honest this one is even better. Its certainly more watchable, as this series contains much better visual effects and better animations. When this series first came out, I was thrilled. I immediately began watching it, and after watching the first episode 'Ambush', I realised how much GL has put into this. Unlike TPM and AOTC, this series is full of potential. The first episode proved how great this series can be, and to be honest, the episodes in Season 1 just got better and better.",/review/rw5984650/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2020,Jonah_R,10," Fantastic
","I am writing this review now after the show has ended with the seventh season. And all i can say is wow...
I am so glad that I started watching this show, not only because it is fantastic on its own, but it also improves the prequels greatly.
I mean I have never hated the prequels and I actually like them, because I grew up with them and I still remember beeing 8 years old and seeing Revenge of the Sith in theaters which was just mind blowing for me back then.",/review/rw5984650/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2021,magnus_nilsson99,7," Brilliant in the end but the beginning was just ok
","Clone Wars has its UPS and downs like a rollercoaster . For exanple Often they use force pull/push as a diciding factor for the character succeed or not . This is really lazy writing and there is more plot holes that is strange and destroys som of the fun for me ! The series takes off in a good way in season 4 , before that it was OK. The end was so awsome the 4 last episodes, that I wish for a remake with the same cutting and camera shots . Here Star Wars really shines and I Got goosebumps in the last shot 10/10 !!",/review/rw5984650/?ref_=tt_urv
