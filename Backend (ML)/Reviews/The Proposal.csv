18 July 2010,MaxBorg89,8," Textbook Egoyan
","If anyone was suited for remaking the French film Nathalie, it was Atom Egoyan, whose deeply twisted and occasionally perverse studies of sexuality, expressed through an apparently cold directorial eye, go hand in hand with a script that emphasized words over images (though there is a bit more flesh in the English-language transition). Hence the rather brilliant Chloe, whose prime accomplishment lies in its being less showy and pretentious than the director's previous foray into erotic secrets, the ambitious Where the Truth Lies.",/review/rw2075302/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2018,ivo-cobra8,8," Amanda Seyfried takes my heart away with her beauty an underrated tragic love drama
","Chloe (2009) is really underrated love tragic drama. It is not that bad of a film I really liked it. I am not a drama love story fan guy but this movie really surprise me. It was not boring, over long or over dramatic like some movies are! It has a love drama and it ends with a twist and with a tragedy on the end of the film. Amanda Seyfried took my heart away with her acting, her beauty and I feel remorse for her character. I understood her character. I know now is based on the earlier French film Nathalie... (2003) I know that film is praised since Chloe come out, but who cares! I hated Dear John and Notebook I hated those films. The only films I liked in drama were American Beauty, Great Expectations that was a based on a novel and The Vow I like those movies.",/review/rw2075302/?ref_=tt_urv

29 March 2010,Quinoa1984,9," an intense drama about sexual identification and fantasy
","Sometimes a story needs to just let its characters go where the situation takes them. A situation isn't always conducive to storytelling (telling a story vs. a situation), but in the case of Chloe it's the way to go. The situation here is this: a doctor (Julianne Moore) is suspicious, perhaps even certain in some way, that her husband, an opera teacher (Liam Neeson) is cheating on her. As a way to find out, or just out of curiosity as to what he'll do, he approaches a call-girl (Amanda Seyfried) who has a knack for fulfilling any client's desire. When Chloe asks this woman about her husband being the client, she says he isn't. Her job will be to approach him, simply, in a cafe and see what he does. But according to Chloe, an innocent conversation (him being ""friendly"" as he is with a lot of women) turns into something else entirely... or is it? ",/review/rw2075302/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2010,IheartCali5882,6," Something A LOT different for Amanda Seyfried....6.5/10
","This film reminded me of the 90's wave of erotic thrillers. It's got all the elements, including a healthy dose of softcore sex scenes which surprised me because Amanda Seyfried has such an endearing, innocent look about her. But she's such a good actress though that this doesn't prevent her from convincingly playing the role of seductive call girl Chloe. Julianne Moore plays Catherine, a gynecologist who suspects her flirtatious husband (Liam Neeson) is having an affair with one of his students. While at work Catherine observes Chloe entering and exiting hotels with several men so she can make a pretty good guess at Chloe's profession. Catherine decides to use Chloe as bait to see if her husband would submit to the temptation of an affair with Chloe.",/review/rw2075302/?ref_=tt_urv

15 July 2010,gradyharp,8," 'I must find something, no matter how small, that I can love...'
","Atom Egoyan ('The Sweet Hereafter', 'Ararat', 'Where the Truth Lies') has a gift for setting up cinematic surveillance of private encounters and studying the results of an incident on everyone witnessing it. In CHLOE he has engaged the services of Erin Cressida Wilson to adapt the French film NATHALIE by Anne Fontaine to place it on this side of the pond. In the French version the successful actors were Fanny Ardant, Emmanuelle Béart, and Gérard Depardieu: for this version Egoyan has an equally superb cast to carry off this mysterious story with great success. The same question arises in both films: 'what is imagined and what is real?', and it is the getting there that makes this film so fascinating. ",/review/rw2075302/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Atom Egoyan behind Chloe is not the auteur behind films like Erotica and The Sweet Hereafter, but he weaves it in the right direction, and the end result may be his most erotic film yet. Ergo, Chloe feels like enough of an Egoyan film for me to argue that going commercial is not something that will degrade the quality of his work, (although I can't say much for Where the Truth Lies.)

22 January 2011,tavm,9," Atom Egoyan's Chloe is a fine sexual suspense drama
","Just unexpectedly watched this independent suspense drama from director Atom Egoyan on a Netflix disc. In it, Julianne Moore plays a woman who suspects husband Liam Neeson is having an affair because of the ways he gets overly friendly with many of his female students and many other women he encounters. So when she chance meets paid escort Amanda Seyfried, she hires her to test his fidelity to his wife. What results is a fascinating exploration of the emotions and insecurities of Moore and Seyfried concerning issues of trust and urges. When the movie revolves around the players I just mentioned, it's quite compelling but when the nearly adult son played by Max Thieriot appears, he's not as intriguing especially when no real explanation comes about his not-so-closeness concerning his mom. Still, the movie Chloe comes highly recommended.",/review/rw2075302/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2011,Maciste_Brother,2," Totally risible!
","CHLOE is the most risible film I've seen since, well, WHERE THE TRUTH LIES. The story is totally whacked and one wonders who in their right mind thought this story made any sense: a spoiled rich gynecologist believes her husband is cheating on her. She suddenly feels invisible: her husband is having sex with one of his young students. Friends are dating young chicks. Her son his sleeping with a hot chick in his bedroom. People all around are boinking chicks. The wife suddenly realizes ""Heck, I'm missing on all of the hot action"" so she decides to hire a hooker, with the idea of seducing her husband to see if he'll sleep with her, but it's all a ruse really because she's the one who ends up having sex with Chloe the Hooker. Chloe invents all these ""hot"" stories of her sleeping with the husband, to dupe the silly wife; these stories are so hot the wife decides to have sex with the hooker, because the wife feels she's invisible and by having sex with Chloe it's like some transference thingy going on and part of the passion the husband is sharing with the hooker the wife thinks she'll feel it too.",/review/rw2075302/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2012,Galina_movie_fan,6," Chloe or Nathalie?
","""Chloe"" (2009) directed by Atom Agoyan is the remake of the French film Nathalie... (2003) made by Anne Fontaine with Fanny Ardant, Emmanuelle Béart, and Gérard Depardieu, as three participants of erotic thrilling psychological drama. Chloe follows the Nathalie's footsteps quite closely. The difference is in the final act, and I prefer Nathalie's ending. All Atom Agoyan and the rest of Chloe's creators had to do to make it a truly great movie -was just to remake step by step the French original. The most amazing thing about Nathalie... was its palpable erotic tension on the screen and at the same time, the lack of steamy sex scenes which was more than compensated with the subtle communication between two women, older, Catherine and younger, Nathalie and between Catherine (Ardant) and her husband of many years (Depardieu) whom she still loves but does not know anymore how to make them both happy.",/review/rw2075302/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2015,raulfaust,8," Introduction To Destruction
","Well, I've been told good about ""Chloe"" for a long time, and last week I decided watching it. From the get go, I could feel there was something about Chloe that would be eventually discovered. Chloe is a girl that gets paid in order to find out if the husband is cheating on the wife. However, things don't go according to plan, and all of a sudden, Chloe is hooking up with the whole family; for some reason, she is capable of seducing everyone out there, albeit she never confesses it. In her opinion, she is just being used by everybody. In this context, Seyfried's character is very covert, causing a BIG mess to each member of the family, and maybe that's why this movie feels so intense. Julianne Moore's character, for instance, gets SO mad and perplexed with Chloe's power to manipulate her that she can't even express it; instead of yelling at her, Dr. Catherine Stewart just pays more money and asks Chloe's, gently, to leave her alone. Maybe that happens because Catherine is just too scared to carry that on. Anyways, the film is great when trying to show how far people can go to reinvent their lives, and the professional cast is quite able to transmit all the feelings they are supposed to be dealing with.",/review/rw2075302/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2018,bettycjung,6," Moore slays!
","2/6/18. I decided to catch this because Julianne Moore has been such a surprise in recent years. Her range is phenomenal! Ever since she won the Oscar for 2015's ""Still Alice"" (watch it!) I have been trying to catch her other movies. She can pretty much play anything, if given the chance. I'm glad I caught this one. Moore plays a doctor who suspects her husband (Neeson) is cheating on her. She hires an escort (Seyfried) to seduce him. In the process, Moore and Seyfried become sexually involved. Only Moore could have pulled off the complexity of her character, a woman torn between too many desires that threaten to overwhelm her. Worth catching.",/review/rw2075302/?ref_=tt_urv

Catherine stumbles with the young call-girl Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) and she hires the escort to seduce her husband and test how faithful he is.

","I have to admit I'm not really a fan of Atom Egoyan; his films always feel a little too 'antiseptic' for my tastes but ""Chloe"", a remake of the French film ""Nathalie"", works surprisingly well. A middle-aged woman, (Julianne Moore), who feels she's no longer that attractive and suspects her husband, (Liam Neeson), of playing around, hires a young escort, (Amanda Seyfried), to test his fidelity only for things to slip out of her control. It's a high-toned movie about the miseries of the rich which, to those of us who don't move in such salubrious circles, might not seem quite so miserable and it's set in a wintery Toronto.",/review/rw2075302/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2010,sddavis63,4," Erotic Thriller With Some Effective Twists But Little Point Or Purpose
","The cast is decent, although not spectacular. Julianna Moore and Liam Neesom are a couple in a tired marriage, when she begins to suspect that he's having an affair. To test his loyalty, she hires Chloe - a prostitute - to test her husband's loyalty by having her try to seduce him. The ""temptation"" takes up a lot of time although finally offers up a surprise twist: David (Neesom) isn't actually having an affair with anyone, but Chloe has developed a fixation with Catharine (Moore) and convinces her that she's managed to seduce him, which opens up the opportunity for her to seduce Catharine. So there are several interesting twists and turns, but frankly the story seemed rather weak; for the most part it hung like a thread.",/review/rw2075302/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2012,dromasca,4," talent wasted on an awful story
","I am sometimes wondering about the bad choices made by one director or the other, or by one actor or another. When such a gathering of talents like Atom Egoyan - director of Ararat, Liam Neeson - star of Schindler's List or Julianne Moore - four time nominated for an Oscar, share the same bad choice I am simply stunned. None of them is visibly on the decreasing slope of their respective careers, none was known to have huge debts to be obliged to accept any role, so why picking a film based on such a stupid and incredible story, with a bad taste that comes close to soft porn - and this is not because of the quantity of skin shown on screen but because the way the story is being told.",/review/rw2075302/?ref_=tt_urv

","A great cast are wasted on a pretty dire script. I suppose they thought they were making something insightful about the nature of trust or something, but it's a pretty average thriller which retreads the same path so many other thrillers have. I must admit I found it rather annoying that we are shown scenes that didn't happen (yes, I know none of it actually happened!). It would have been more acceptable to me if the scenes of Chloe's imagined relationship with the David, the husband (Liam Neeson) had been given a voice-over by her. That would have indicated that the action could have been taking place in her head. ",/review/rw2075302/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2009,Tronc,," Last night's review
","Saw CHLOE last night. I love all of Atom Egoyan's films and this was no exception. We were warned going in that the movie was going to be sexually graphic. While this movie was highly erotic it was done extremely tastefully. Other directors would have gone more and cheapened it. Toward the end I was afraid we were heading for another Fatal Attraction but fortunately did not go that way. This was Julianne Moore's movie, no doubt, and I am rather surprised at the amount of nudity she showed. And Amanda Seyfried was HOT! Liam Neeson is almost a footnote in this film but he shows what a professional he is to do a film of this type after his family tragedy. I think this was the most erotic movie Egoyan's done since Exotica. Highly recommended.",/review/rw2075302/?ref_=tt_urv
