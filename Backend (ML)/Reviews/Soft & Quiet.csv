8 December 2022,jtindahouse,9," I didn't see it coming
","Wow. This is one of those genuine cases of the less you know going in, the harder the film is going to hit. Everything seems normal until along comes - a shot of a pie. And nothing is the same from there out. This was a tough watch but also a really enjoyable one.",/review/rw8658693/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2022,ferguson-6,7," watching and squirming
","SXSW 2022
Greetings again from the darkness. If you prefer your movies light-hearted, good-natured, and relaxing to the spirit, then you need to avoid writer-director Beth de Araujo's first feature film at all costs. I'm not sure I've ever been more uncomfortable watching a movie than I was during this one. Whatever you do, don't assume that a story featuring a group of young women meeting in a church for snacks and socializing will be cute or funny. This is neither. In fact, I'm at a loss for the properly descriptive words.",/review/rw8658693/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2022,jfgibson73,8," How much should you know ahead of time?
","From a story perspective, this movie has a lot of surprises that you don't want to ruin by reading about it before watching. On the other hand, you should probably have some idea of what you're getting into, especially if you need to avoid certain triggers. This movie gets pretty messed up, and it is filmed in a way that is meant to immerse you in the situation as much as possible: it appears to unfold in a single, unbroken take (said to actually be four takes, which is still impressive) with a you-are-there positioning of the camera. It gets a little shaky at times, but it's not found footage--it's more like the camera feels what the characters feel, such as the motion of a car. One thing I will mention is that I turned this movie on when I was almost ready to fall asleep, but once it started, I didn't look away. It can be tricky sometimes trying to decide to see a movie that has been labeled ""disturbing."" Sometimes it may end up not bothering you too much, other times you end up with images you never wanted in your head. You'll have to follow your own instincts, I guess. For me, Soft and Quiet had some tough stuff in it, but it ended up being a unique experience that was worth the risk.",/review/rw8658693/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2022,Xstal,7," Church of the Poisoned Mind...
","A group of ladies is convened, they all have a common theme, disgruntled you could say, pure vitriol they spray, feel as if they've been let down, these diverse days make them frown, they don't have a lot to ask, from behind their hateful mask, so they're going to drop an anchor, that will make you grate with rancour, leave you stunned and disbelieving, as your eyebrows hit the ceiling, you may know people like this, living life in an abyss, a soft and quiet outer shell, but inside under a spell.",/review/rw8658693/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,Armin_Nikkhah_Shirazi,9," A hard-hitting study of bigotry
","SOFT AND QUIET is one of those movies where the less you know about it ahead of time, the more effective it is. So, if you have not yet seen it, you should watch it first before reading the analysis below.",/review/rw8658693/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2022,MarioTee,7," Indeed hard to watch but I liked it
","First of all, props for the entire crew to be filming it in one shot, I can only imagine the pressure they were under. This is, if I am not mistaken, only the second one (next to Birdman) I've watched.",/review/rw8658693/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,MK_Ultra_,8," Hard to watch. Hard to fathom at times.
","Blumhouse has a knack for provocation---and though not standardized horror or thriller in the Blumhouse mold, it lies in its own subgenre of fragile white identities gone extreme much like the fringey elements of American History X did in the past. If this film makes you uncomfortable, then it delivered its message successfully, in a one take, hardline address of racism in the US and the tendencies they bring out in what first appears to be ""normal everyday group of women"" meeting up for a post-workday friendly ""workshop"" of thoughts and daily agenda. Sounds innocent enough, but it takes no longer than the foil coming off a dessert to show what lies beneath. It's not pretty folks, but that is the gist of the narrative, that the unfounded hate and discrimination is indeed very ugly and you watch it unfold in a slick, non-gimmicky little dark film that doesn't exploit but rips the bandaid off the wound that is extremism and the violence that hides beneath. In plain sight in fact.",/review/rw8658693/?ref_=tt_urv

3 November 2022,A_Different_Drummer,7," what's the opposite of ""safe space?""
","Not for snowflakes, easily triggered college kids or adults who are now addicted to the pre-digested, pre-censored, groupthink that dominates most of today's social media. This is, to borrow the title of a classic Monty Python film, something completely different. So different that, in the opinion of this reviewer, it would never have been greenlighted as a series. Or a mainstream feature. Only the strange and largely undefined world of indie cinema could have produced something as unexpected as SOFT & QUIET. Off the top, newcomer writer/director Beth de Ara√∫jo deserves praise for demonstrating how effective ""single shot"" filming can be to enhance exposition in a story which leans more towards a stage play than an action or horror film. At least initially. For the first hour anyway. If you check the External Reviews, you will see that even experienced reviewers had trouble finding words to describe this odd counter-culture, counter-genre, brutal deconstruction of Political Correctness in all its terrible glory. Not your typical horror film. Not your typical anything. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

12 November 2022,bob_meg,4," Timely and well-intentioned but winds up consuming itself
","Beth de Araujo's Soft & Quiet is getting a lot of positive buzz since Blumhouse picked it up and is mass distributing it. I've seen the film twice now --- just to make sure I'm not missing something really revelatory --- but it consistently appears to fall apart at about the halfway mark, after a squirm-inducing, provocative, and relatively well-performed first half. It's really kind of a shame.",/review/rw8658693/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2023,jadavix,7," Hard to sit through, well-made, but not bold enough
","It's hard to review a movie like ""Soft & Quiet"" (and what a misnomer that title is). It's well made, well acted, involving, has some effective moments... but it is not in the least enjoyable. It's not a pleasant experience to sit through it. If we're rating it for its effectiveness at what it sets out to do, it gets high marks. If we're rating the experience of watching it for most people, who want to be entertained at the movies, we feel like we have to warn them. Most people will hate it and feel like they wasted their time sitting through it.",/review/rw8658693/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,sashahead,4," not a movie just a primitive story

14 January 2023,kjjames81,4," No depth to this movie
","While I liked the real time element with this movie and the first fifteen minutes were very close the the knuckle when the women were having a meeting and talking about what most people think about what is happening in the world now, this wasn't hard to watch, just listen to what they say.",/review/rw8658693/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2022,gabni,4," Birth of a Nation
","A bunch of Karen's instigate and execute a hate crime breaking numerous laws, including murder. The ending leaves you hanging ... putting you in the shoes of the powerless who do not believe in the justice system, because perpetrators of violence against minorities often escape punishment. The ending, rather than offer hope for a future comeuppance, is a dog whistle to leave no loose strings. This movie just stirs up the pot and leaves a mess for the audience to clean up. It's shocking, agitating, and unbalanced. The way it was filmed, as if you were a fly on a wall, watching the events unfold, immerses you into the film, but it's a ride you wish you sat out half way through.",/review/rw8658693/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2023,gage-72052,1," Worst movie I have ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","I want to receive a lobotomy to forget this awful movie. This movie is not edgy or cutting edge, it is the lowest form of, I do not have the words to define what this is. The only comparison I can think of is a snuff film. The acting was atrocious, the plot points didn't make sense to me. If the writer/director was trying to make a point about social justice, then they should have made a documentary or a drama. But this director should not create horror movies. Racism and the effect it has on society is horrific and should be revealed in all forms of art and media, but this movie is just horrible. I cannot stress enough that this movie is not a groundbreaking masterpiece like Get Out or Us which are excellent examples of combining racism in society and the horror genre. I do not understand the high metacritic rating. My only regret is that I cannot give a grade of zero!!!!!!!!!!",/review/rw8658693/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,Vancouver77,3," Appalling
","Well, the acting is well done. But I am not sure what the point of this movie was. It made my skin crawl. Who wants to watch the absolute worst of humanity engage in depraved acts? Who wants to be entertained by the expression of base, indefensible thoughts? I was hoping this movie was a thriller, or perhaps suspense but it is none of those things. Nor is it a ""cautionary tale"" or something that leaves you with some kind of valuable take-away or message. Perhaps it intended to be ""thought provoking""? If you consider certain behaviour abhorrent, you don't give it air-time, you don't give it ""space"" in our society & you certainly don't make entertainment out of it. I am not sure how this movie got funding, why the actors would want to participate, or why anyone would want to watch it. I had to fast forward through it to make it to the banal ending. I am not sure how it presently has its high rating because there is little to redeem this movie. I gave it 3 because the acting was decent. I hope the director and screenwriter find a way to merit their existence on earth going forward, because this movie is a complete waste.",/review/rw8658693/?ref_=tt_urv
