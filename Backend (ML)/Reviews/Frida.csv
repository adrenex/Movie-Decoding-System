","Just a ripping movie that came out of nowhere. Keanu Reeves, action star? Who Knew.
Swayze is mega convincing as the rogue surfer dude looking to live the dream.",/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2021,classicsoncall,7," ""If you want the ultimate, you gotta be willing to pay the ultimate price.""
","Surfing fans and adrenaline junkies will get a huge charge out of this film, with Patrick Swayze's character challenging his band of 'Ex-Presidents' and FBI agent Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) into performing more and more dangerous stunts, for that rush one gets by living in the moment. Highlights of the picture include the memorable foot chase by Johnny attempting to run down Bodhi (Swayze) in the Reagan mask, and that pair of insane free fall jumps, one of them sans parachute by the intrepid agent Utah. Outside of a James Bond film, you probably won't find anything quite that crazy. Gary Busey had the distinct pleasure of appearing not only in this surfer flick, but 1978's ""Big Wednesday"" as well, though he limits his venture in this one to strictly land based activities. My ears perked up when I heard Johnny mention his surveillance of Bodhi by stating that he saw him go into Patrick's Roadhouse, a neat reference to Swayze's 1978 picture of the same name. I thought it noble for Johnny to let Bodhi go out on his own terms at the finale during the much anticipated 'fifty year storm', an ending that would appeal to the most hard core action fans, even if you had to picture it in your own imagination.",/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2020,monkeysgalore,10," Surfing, Action, Bank Robbing, and Patrick Swayze's Mullet
","You know those movies where there's not one realistic thing about them, but it only adds to the charm and fun of it? Where the insanity and occasional inane script choices make it that much more entertaining? Point Break is such a film. It doesn't operate on any levels of reality, unashamedly, and wears its ""movie"" status proudly, deciding instead to tell a intricate tale, which is loads of fun. Kathryn Bigelow should be proud.",/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2019,UniqueParticle,9," Pure exhilarating 90's fun!
","Patrick Swaze and Keanu Reeves blow your mind out of the water! Very well written and clever. Epic how the heists in this became an inspiration for the video game Payday:The Heist and from the other movie Heist. This has an excellent cast, wild stunts, and the beautiful cinematography - everything you'd want from a action phenomenon!!",/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 1999,Keegen,," An under-rated classic
","Point Break is one of those films that everybody loves, but that nobody actually talks about all that often. It is a film that if you mention it in conversation, everyone else around is bound to say how much they enjoyed it.",/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2019,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,10," Swayze/Reeves best action movie, one of my personal favorite 90's action films of all time
","To me one of the best action movies of the 90's. Point Break is a 1991 action heist 100 percent pure adrenaline rush movie. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow and stars: Patrick Swayze, Keanu Reeves and Gary Busey. This review is only dediceted to Point Break fans and no one else. If you love the movie come read my review I am also reviewing this movie on YouTube I am going to defend it. I Love this film to death, I have a history with this film. This is going to be one of my hardest reviews I have done before. I would say the movie halped me get trough tough times in the year 2005. I am also going to defend this movie and Keanu Reeves character Johnny Utah.",/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2011,Leofwine_draca,6," Swayze's never been better
","The ultimate buddy movie? POINT BREAK comes close. Few films can offer the same kind of male bonding found here, as two men on opposite sides of the law find themselves growing close thanks to a shared world view.",/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2018,nat-dalby,9," Still one of the '90s' most substantial action films
","Point Break is one of those films that's massively entertaining no matter how many times you watch it. Whilst this is common in the action genre, Point Break stands out in its era by being more of a morally complex story.",/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2021,Calicodreamin,7," Reeves and Swayze ðŸ’¯
","Everything good from this movie comes from the absolute amazing fact that Reeves and Swayze are the leads. They give off the perfect 90s surfer frenemy vibes. The storyline is unique and a bit of a bloodbath near the end, but honestly a decent watch.",/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2019,lyndean-4,10," They don't make movies like this today
",Who misses Patrick Swayze - I know I do. He was always good in whatever movie but particularly in this one - such a wide range of acting. I hadn't seen it for years and it came up on tv so I recorded it so I can watch it over.,/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2015,SnoopyStyle,8," solid undercover cop drama
","Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) aces his FBI training. In L.A., the rookie is assigned to agent Angelo Pappas (Gary Busey) to investigate a series of bank robberies by the ""Ex-Presidents"". Pappas has a theory that the robbers are surfers. Utah learns to surf and infiltrate the insular community. He gets rescued by Tyler Endicott (Lori Petty) and pays her to teach him. Tyler's ex Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) leads a group of surfers. Bodhi befriends Johnny after recognizing him as the former college football star.",/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2019,lakishaferguson21,7," Exciting watch
","As a 90s kid I've always been aware of this flick but never watched, until it showed up on Hulu. Glad I finally watched because it was definitely entertaining. Loved seeing Patrick amd Keanu in one of their most famous roles. I enjoyed the play on undercover agent infiltrating a subculture not to often heard from. It's not Broadway nor is it MARVEL superheroes, but it's quality entertainment worth watching more than once.
On another note, it was AWESOME seeing the lead singer of one of my all time favorite bands in this; even though he does something quite hilarious!",/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2003,Mikew3001,9," Great ""new age"" action thriller
","Katheryn Bigelow's 1991 action thriller ""Point Break"" is still a ground-breaking film of the early nineties. It tells the story of the cop John Utah (Keanu Reaves) hunting a bunch of bank robbers camouflaged with masks of the former U.S. presidents. His investigations leads to a group of surfers and extreme sports worshippers, and the cop becomes fascinated by the free-style philosophies and adrenaline rushes of the gang around the charismatic leader Bodhi (Patrick Swayze). Their close friendship changes to a hard-fought rivalry at the end when cop and gangsters face point blank.",/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,david-meldrum,8," Firmly In The Action-Thriller Canon
","If there is a canon of action-thrillers then this is firmly in there. Swayze and Reeves were perfectly cast, and Biegelow's trademark eye for the dynamics at work in groups of alpha makes still lift it well above its imitators. It still looks spectacular too; beautifully shot and artfully staged, with action sequences that still genuinely stand up.",/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2019,IMDbKeepsDeletingMyReviews,8," What a stylish and dynamic ride!
","I really like Keanu Reeves. But boy, does Patrick Swayze steal the show. In what is maybe the most charismatic role of his career, he makes Keanu develop a serious man-crush on him, and we can all understand why Keanu couldn't do what he was about to do in one of the most iconic scenes of the film.",/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 1999,mikew-8,10," The Sum is larger than the Parts.
","Movies are like Bands. People come together--maybe they're not even the greatest musicians individually--but together, something meshes and they make great music. It takes more than great musicians to make a great band. Just so, some movies, no matter how much money, talent, and horsepower is brought to bear, just don't coalesce. Others, like Point Break, come together with an ineffable ""rightness"" that defies any of the parts, logic, or analysis. This is one of my favorite movies. Period. Everything ""works."" This movie ROCKS.",/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv

27 September 2006,gbenson20,10," How can you not like this film...
","OK, sure it is just a big action film with a flimsy script and crazy stunts but.... it is filmed so great. It feels so summer in Cali. It makes you want to forget your blah zaa blah job, move to the beach and surf your azz off and have summer bonfires all night and party the night away. I have been reading others comments on why they can't understand the guilty pleasure about this movie.... Duh that's the whole idea. Yes you can like movies that have you thinking about this and that at the end. You can have movies that astound you. And of course you can have movies that can make you feel like you had a great F'N experience. This is what this movie is. Eat your popcorn. Dive into it AND have a great time. Who cares about the social impact. Enjoy it and think about this. Sex Wax! If it's in the movie, it's a FUN movie! Holla",/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 1999,Peach-2,8," Goofy and fun.
","This movie has energy. The story is kinda goofy, but the direction from Kathryn Bigelow has the right amount of pacing and atmosphere. The chase scene midway through the film is a breath-taking example of what film-makers can do, if they have energy and vision. This movie is pure entertainment and a blast to watch.",/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2020,xpat-55192,10," Underrated Entertainment enjoyed often..
","A lightweight premise performed well by the whole cast, but particularly the sadly-late Patrick Swayze, with Gary Busey and John C. McGinley keep the movie humming along. Sometimes wooden in a Bill and Ted trance, Keanu Reeves does okay too.
An entertaining story, solid thespian talent and some spectacular cinematography make this a thoroughly recommended watch. A1+",/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2004,rhino-25,8," The film for an adrenaline generation

17 March 2008,ma-cortes,7," Solid and incredible thriller with spectacular scenes about surfing and skydiving
","FBI agent going up against a bank robberies executed by a band masked like US President, wearing Johnson, Carter, Nixon and Reagan masks. Although they never shoot anybody and never go into the vaults. The agent is hot on the trail but he's sucked by Patrick Swayze guru, a leader of the beach subculture, a fun-loving with destructive ways who plays cat and mouse game with the Feds. Meanwhile Reeves falls in love with Lori Petti, a beautiful surfing trainer.",/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv

19 July 2001,Mr Parker,," Super Surf Sandwich
","I like this movie. I can't really go into why too much but I can tell you that I watch this flick everytime it comes on cable if I'm home. I think it's worth a couple of hours of your day. It first comes off as kind of hokey but somehow ends up becoming very engrossing. Keanu Reeves gives us a nice display of things to come in his career as this movie was released pre-Speed and Matrix. Patrick Swayze gives us a nice little performance as surfing zen Bodhi. The surfing scenes are well done and so are the bank robbery pieces. Kathryn Bigelow does a good job directing this one and the rest of the cast, especially Gary Busey, turn in solid performances. Note the chase scene with Keanu Reeves going after a Ronald Reagan masked Swayze: I'd put it in the top ten chase scenes of all times and I think most people would agree with me on that one. Definitely worth checking out. **** out of *****.",/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2016,mperry35,10," Point Break is legendary
","I have loved this film since the first time I saw it in '91. The action is terrific, the actors are great together, the soundtrack is excellent & the storyline ties it all together beautifully. All together, it makes for a fantastic movie experience. For me, there's an indescribable ambiance that the movie creates, when i watch it. I become invested in each one of the characters. I appreciate how Johnny & Papas develop a close ""father & son-ish"" relationship. Both are a little ornery w sarcastic personalities. Bodhi & his crew are a very close-nit group, too. They aren't really violent individuals, at heart (minus Rosie), but they will project violence in order to make money so they can continue living the adventurous, care-free lifestyles that they love & have grown accustomed to, via surfing, skydiving, etc. It's without question, one of my Top 10 fav flicks of all-time. The creators of the 2015 Point Breakshould be ashamed of themselves. They didn't come anywhere close to the quality of the ""real"" Point Break. I actually find it offensive that they thought they could create a present-day Point Break that would even be in the same galaxy as the original. If u haven't seen Point Break '91, then u have deprived yourself of a awesome movie. Go rent it or buy it...u can find it on blu-ray, these days.",/review/rw3394297/?ref_=tt_urv
