28 August 2016,Leofwine_draca,9," Genius thriller
","This unique and well-crafted tale is a top-notch thriller packed with suspense, excellent characterisation, and a style of story-telling which means the viewer has to use his or her brain for a change. Unsurprisingly it seems to have been ignored by the mainstream crowd, but in any case it's one of the best (if not THE best) films of 2000. Guy Pearce is outstanding in the leading role of Leonard, a man who has developed a short-term memory loss syndrome since a horrific accident which means he cannot remember anything for longer than twenty minute intervals. Thus he is forced to tattoo clues on his body and take Polaroids to remind himself of his quest, which is to hunt for the man who raped and murdered his wife and kill him.",/review/rw1170614/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2020,nateahoey,10," I guessed and guessed... I never got close.
","I know that it's a little late by now for this review considering this movie is twenty years old by now. However, it's still amazing. The way that Christopher Nolan puts this movie in a jumbled order that you don't quite realize until halfway through is genius. What's very interesting is how you have to think for a while then you get it. Spoilers ahead stop reading if you haven't seen it yet!
You have the movie starting with him shooting Teddy, and then how he got there in the next scene, but what's funny is you think it's leading up to (or I guess leading down to) how he's going to reveal that Teddy is the bad guy. He is not! He's a cop, a not crooked one but a cop all the same, that's using a guy with no short-term memory to kill off drug dealers. Then you have Natalie, who seems nice but is ripping him off just the same and is using him to kill drug dealers that are competition and to get the cop off of the streets. You have him being used by everyone around to fit their purpose, turning him from a man on a revenged quest to basically a serial killer. They make him kill who they want as long as they justify it will help him. It's very well told and really makes you mad that the guy you're rotting for is a killer that's been duped. Nobody is a good guy. There is no hero. And why is it good then? It plays with your mind so well, you walk away and contemplate on it forever. Great movie, one of Nolan's best ever.",/review/rw1170614/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2003,Old Joe,10," Some memories are best forgotten. You have to appreciate how original a movie Memento' really is!
","Losing your memory would have to go close to one of the worst experience anyone could ever suffer from. In the movie Memento', we get to see how bad it is to suffer from short term memory loss. It also gives us the chance to see how far a patient of such a disease will go to remember what is most important to him. In the vain of Pulp Fiction', Memento is a movie that has to be seen to be believed. It is no wonder that this movie is so popular with the movie going public around the world.

1 September 2003,quixoboy,," Addictive and fun to figure out
","Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" is truly a rare and exceptional achievement in modern filmmaking in that it manages to be new, fresh, hip, and exciting without ever tiring its audience out - unless you're walking into this film without the desire to participate and actively analyze the mysterious details.",/review/rw1170614/?ref_=tt_urv

4 April 2009,ruffinelli_ro,9," A trip into the mind
","If the director of this independent film tried to make us feel really confused, like the main character, he did it wonderfully. There are only a few movies like this one, the kind of movies that makes you pay attention to every minute of it. Obviously that doesn't work all the time, but this case is the exception. Really well directed with a wonderful photography and excellent cast. The main actors' performances are great. We really root for the guy as we hate the ones who try to take advantage of him.",/review/rw1170614/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you're looking for something intense, suspenseful, and different than your usual effects-packed thriller, this is the best movie you will see all year. You will be talking about Memento at work, at the grocery store (to total strangers!), and you will find yourself joining conversations when you hear the word ""Memento."" That's why this little film that received almost no marketing stayed in theaters for months and was in the top 10 money makers for several weeks.",/review/rw1170614/?ref_=tt_urv

","I saw ""Memento"" in the early afternoon, a fact for which I am thankful. Why?  Because it then proceeded to dominate the majority of my thoughts for the rest of the day.  That night I lay in bed, tossing and turning, my mind trying to wrap itself around the story, and I absolutely could not GO TO SLEEP!  ",/review/rw1170614/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2001,Hitchcoc,9," Mind Blowing
","I spent considerable time doing research on the brain for a class I was teaching.  One of the most intriguing things I dealt with was the idea of short term memory.  There are cases of people who carry around a suitcase with them, containing all the things they need to continually review to stay in the present with any sort of functionality.  I had heard about this film and read a very sketchy review.  I rented it because I knew my family wouldn't be interested in the violence.  So late at night, I sat and took this film in with total concentration.  I need to watch it again, but right now it may have cracked my top ten list.  The last time I was so enthralled by a film was Coppola's ""The Conversation.""  Both of these films are fairly bleak and occasionally confusing and absolutely captivating. How anyone can be bored by this with all the junk that is being produced these days, I will never understand.  I know it's a gimmick film.  I know it's manipulative. So what?  Don't all films manipulate us, especially those steeped in mystery and suspense.  I knew exactly what was going on and I couldn't wait to see how it ended (began).  ",/review/rw1170614/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2017,TheLittleSongbird,10," A very strong contender for Christopher Nolan's best film
","Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.",/review/rw1170614/?ref_=tt_urv

It took me time to release this fact but Memento opened the doors for me to watch more original & indie movies.",/review/rw1170614/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you have watched the very first movie done by Mr. Nolan, than yes you have seen this before. Not exactly like this and with quite a few flaws, but if you consider that it was more or less a student film and seeing this, probably nothing more than an exercise on how to do it on a grand scale, than it was more than decent.",/review/rw1170614/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2001,EThompsonUMD,9," Original and intriguing film noir revision.
","Revising such film noir conventions as a story told through the unreliable point of view and voice-over narration of a morally flawed investigator-protagonist, the pervasive infusion of a dark past into the narrative present, and the use of a femme fatale as an embodiment of evil allure, Memento is perhaps the most original and intriguing revision of the genre since Welles' Touch of Evil.",/review/rw1170614/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is based on a novel by Jonathon Nolan (Chris Nolan's brother) and starring Australian actor Guy Pearce.

25 June 2005,lee_eisenberg,10," like nothing that you've ever seen before
","""Memento"" is one of those movies that I fear discussing because I don't know how much I can tell without giving the whole thing away. You might have heard that the story gets told in reverse and that Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, who has a memory problem. People are able to abuse him and all sorts of other horrible things. Then, he has to use the little bit of memory that he has left to...no, I can't tell you; it would give the whole movie away. My point is that ""Memento"" is a most incredible movie. You quite literally have to see it to believe it. You might even want to watch it more than once, possibly backwards. Or something similar.",/review/rw1170614/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2001,Pseudo-geordie boy,," Confusion, uncertainty, and paranoia as an art form: possibly.
","If I told you the entire plot of this film it really wouldn't matter as it is an exquisite paean to the subjectivity of memory and therefore is in itself ambiguous; the truth' of it is up to you. You come out of the cinema questioning yourself, your memories, your truths. Nothing in this film is as it seems, and yet paradoxically everything is as it seems. We see everything through Guy Pearce's characters' (Lenny) eyes, unfortunately he has no short-term memory so cannot form new memories. He would have already forgotten the first sentence of this review. He lives in snapshots of life; his only form of memory is his Polaroid camera, just like in the excellent German film Wintersleepers; also (partly) about a short-term memory disorder.",/review/rw1170614/?ref_=tt_urv

9 May 2001,jbparker,9," Its not a gimmick, its something new
","Yes, it's true.  The entire movie is based on a gimmick.  However, I honestly feel that this does not cheapen the picture in the slightest bit. I loved every scene; discovering information as our lead character discovered it. It demands a second and third viewing, as there are many subtleties and quick flashes that may not be picked up on the first time around.  Its one of the most original films ever made, and for people who scoff at the concept of not having a short-term memory, it actually is a real condition. Watch this movie. And, please pay attention. The performances are wonderful, and its structured magnificently.",/review/rw1170614/?ref_=tt_urv

","Leonard (Guy Pearce) suffers from short term memory loss. His last permanent memory is an attack by two men. He killed the one who killed his wife. The other one escaped after clubbing him in the head. The police dismisses the idea of a second man. He keeps a record of his experiences using tattoos, Polaroids and hidden notes.
