8 April 2001,mattymatt4ever,8," Surprisingly good!
","If someone checks out the trailer, one might think, ""Another MTV-produced teen flick.  I think I'll pass on that.""  Well, I went into the theater not thinking it was going to be bad, but I expected more of an amusing film that isn't really high on ingenuity.  True, ""Varsity Blues"" has those standard teen elements like wild drinking parties, the school slut, etc.  But it never overuses those elements.  It's more of a compelling comedy-drama about football that delivers a fine message about sportsmanship.  You have a pretty good idea how it's going to end up, but it's the way it's executed that makes it special.  Jon Voight is absolutely terrific as the no-nonsense coach.  He's the kind of character you want to stab in the chest every minute he's on screen, and Voight was a perfect choice.  The film dabbles with elements of the sport that probably hit home to some high school football players.  Voight's character has only one goal: winning.  And he doesn't care how he gets to that goal.  If he has to shoot drugs into every one of his players, he's going to arrive at that goal.  And I'm sure there are coaches out there who have that selfish goal.  Then James Van Der Beek comes along, and his character is not really concerned with winning or playing football in the first place.  But he likes football, has fun with it and simply wants to play a good, honest game.  If the team wins, good.  If it doesn't, so what.  He has a good locker room speech at the end of the movie.

31 March 2000,Tito-8,8," A pleasant surprise
","Since this is a teen-oriented film, I must confess that I wasn't expecting this to be very entertaining.  However, thanks to a generally intelligent script and a great job by Jon Voight, this turned out to be surprisingly good.  As you would probably expect in a teen movie, there are some scenes that seem juvenile and pointless, but thankfully, this film manages to limit these needless diversions.  The central story, although a familiar one, is well written and rather interesting.  Definitely worth checking out.",/review/rw2929640/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2001,MadReviewer,6," Fairly entertaining, despite all the cliches
","Like a number of other reviewers, I though ""Varsity Blues"" wouldn't amount to much more than ""Dawson Plays Football"", MTV-style. Well, it's not -- it's actually quite good.  It deals fairly realistically with the trials and tribulations of Dawson . . . sorry, Mox (James Van Der Beek), the backup quarterback more interested in ""Catcher in the Rye"" than in his own playbook, who is forced to become the starter for his team.  The movie's filled with cliches:  the town obsessed with the football team; the overweight, goofy lineman; the slutty cheerleader with the heart of gold; the arrogant coach; the teacher straight out of an early 80's Van Halen video; etc, etc.  Surprisingly, there's enough twisted and wrinkles thrown into these cliches to make the story seem pretty fresh, if not entirely original.  You know how the story's going to end, but you're not always sure how it's going to get there, and that's what keeps it interesting.",/review/rw2929640/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 1999,thefan-2,8," Excellent high school melodrama
","Good kids vs evil football coach.  The only thing that can make such a movie watchable is memorable characters created by good actors, and here is where Varsity Blues succeeds. I love it when I go into a movie expecting to hate it and then end up enjoying it.  Give this one a try.",/review/rw2929640/?ref_=tt_urv

29 June 1999,Adriane,," Best teen movie of the year!!
","From the previews, you would think that this movie is all fluff. But, there is actually a story involved here. Kids trying to be all that they can be despite a winning-obsessed coach (well played by Jon Voight) and pressures by parents and the town. Van Der Beek plays ""Mox"" very well, and there is a great soundtrack. It is better than most of the teen movies this year and deserves a watch.",/review/rw2929640/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2019,nicholls905-280-546911,7," Surprisingly good
","Voight helps guide this ship and the young cast are surprisingly up to the challenge of being in his presence. The film is a little mixed early on as it flirts with teenage humour, but it course corrects later. The film is better when it deals with the competitive nature of sport in small towns. The final third of this movie is the best part and saves an odd film narrative from being completely overshadowed by teenage cheap humour.",/review/rw2929640/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2002,chrisbrown6453,8," Varsity Blues tells the story of a high school in a small town in Texas, where football is king.
","I'm sure we've all known of, or at least heard of places, where nothing is bigger than high school football. The starting quarterback runs the town, the coach is considered a God (as long as he's winning), and the parents all live vicariously through their children. And most of the time, the kids actually playing football love the game too. But in the small town of West Caanan, the kids are running rampant, and the coach (Jon Voight) doesn't care.

8 July 2013,g-bodyl,9," Predictable but Good!
","Varsity Blues is a very predictable football drama that is very similar in tone and style to 2004's Friday Night Lights. While I like that film better, this is not a bad film at all. I was still able to root for and against some characters. This movie does a good job at holding my attention and bringing back some good high school memories.",/review/rw2929640/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2020,jmworacle-99025,7," In Texas it's God, Family, Country, and Football,.... maybe.
","To me high school football is Texas football. I'm from South Florida and currently live in Southern Alabama as good as their programs are, they don't hold a candle to Texas football. I was lucky to play one year of J.V. football where I kept the bench nice and warm for the starters until in order to prevent the opponent from taking things out against the varsity team the next evening. The night of the homecoming bonfire there were more people at the J.V. game than at the event. Our opponent the Barbers Hill Eagles had already won the Varsity and Middle School Championship for the District and our game would cap off the hat trick. Going into the game we were confident of a victory because earlier in the year as a filler game
we played and had easily won. No such luck. Suddenly the opponent suddenly gained twenty pounds of muscle and it was different. Thankfully due to two missed two point conversions and with a little over three minutes to go our star running ripped of a ninety three yard touchdown run to win the game. The Eagles coaches were so angry they made the team run back to the locker room ( they were bused in). Enough of memory lane.",/review/rw2929640/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 1999,RJBose,8," An enjoyable, entertaining diversion; what a movie is supposed to be.
","This is an unpretentious and entertaining movie about high school football in a small Texas community. OK, so we know who will win the Big Game, and that the Hero won't sell out to the mean and selfish 23-District-Championships-Coach (Jon Voigt).  The movie is well paced and a pleasant diversion; (many in the audience actually applauded at the climactic scenes in the final moments).",/review/rw2929640/?ref_=tt_urv

","Having played football in West Texas for a 3-A dynasty team, this movie brings back the memories and the nightmares that a dynasty town can give. The scene with the convience store clerk giving Mox the beer is a regular thing as far as the players getting ""special"" treatment. The attitude of the players and coaches seem real.

22 June 2013,Wuchakk,8," Very entertaining sports movie
","Released in 1999, ""Varsity Blues"" is a sports film about football in Central Texas, where high school football is virtually a religion. I was surprised at how engrossing and entertaining ""Varsity Blues"" is, much more so than similar films, like ""Remember the Titans"" (2000), ""Woodlawn"" (2015) and scores of others.",/review/rw2929640/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2019,Svenstadt,7," This is what real teenagers deal with.
","I really liked this movie because it could have been me in high school. I recognized and empathized with many of the characters in this. At times it seems inane, but that is sort of real for teenagers to do.
James Van Der Beek goes a little far with the character, who is a sheepish, pouty rebel. His acting and accent could have used some work too. His character is practically a port of his Dawson's Creek character. That is the biggest criticism: the characters seem a little too simplistic, and the resolutions to their problems seems scripted and forced at times.
There is quite a bit of sexuality, which is very titilating.
Unlike a Brett Easton Ellis based movie, there is more realism in this.",/review/rw2929640/?ref_=tt_urv

","But nonetheless a entertaining sports movie, all good fun made to look not so dangerous, you don't see the seedy nasty business that really goes on, oh you see it made to look funny but it this is what really goes on in high school football in most instances. Good acting for some teen up and comers actors in the 90s. Good movie but it doesn't take itself too seriously in some serious situations. A coming of age movie that I as a Teen thought it was great then and still has a spot in my heart, it was great then and still has a place in football movies at the top. Good Comedy/Drama.",/review/rw2929640/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2012,mfnmbvp,8," 'Varsity Blues' (1999)
","I really enjoyed the MTV Films era, and it's sad that it didn't last longer than it did, and 'Varsity Blues' feels almost like one of their more special endeavors because it is a far more serious effort than anything they had laid on us before. This definitely isn't 'Beavis And Butt-head Do America' or 'Jackass: The Movie'. The serious approach never really feels like it is taking itself too seriously, there is still obvious satire and blatantly crude gags littered about. 1999 was a long time ago now, and just taking a fast glance around this film we see a whole bunch of recognizable faces nowadays. Jon Voight who we all know from his seemingly endless slew of good performances, Paul Walker of 'The Fast And The Furious' fame, Ali Larter, Amy Smart, Scott Caan. But what about James Van Der Beek? This guy is a decent enough actor, he really gives off the right vibe as the kid who would rather read Vonnegut on the sidelines rather than play football, and I think it's quite shameful that he isn't in more films like this, he was almost generation-defining with his fame garnered from 'Dawson's Creek'. I guess the fact that he pretty much disappeared from the face of the Earth after he made 'The Rules Of Attraction' just helps to ensure the cult-status of films like 'Varsity Blues' in the first place. We have two people working on this project who also worked on 'Good Burger' a few years prior, our director Brian Robbins and Ron Lester who plays one of our more memorable characters here, and it's nice to see them all stepping up the maturity level a little bit. They went from graduating middle school (Nickelodeon) to graduating high school (MTV) in just two years.",/review/rw2929640/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 1999,zack2085,," Varsity Blues to put it simply, ROCKS!!!
","Out of all the MTV movies I've seen, ""Varsity Blues"" was definitely the best. It's cast did great acting and good portrayals of high school students and teachers. James Van Der Beek is just as good as the football jock as he is as movie buff Dawson on ""Dawson's Creek"". There is about an F word every 2 minutes and close up scenes of breasts, so this movie is not for kids. I'd say 14 and up. All out good teen movie. I would recommend it strongly.",/review/rw2929640/?ref_=tt_urv

Coach Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight) hates his attitude and berates him for it. His girlfriend Julie Harbor (Amy Smart) is the sister of the star quarterback Lance (Paul Walker). Offensive lineman Billy Bob (Ron Lester) passes out and Lance gets hurt being sacked. John Moxon goes into the game, throws out the playbook and wins the game. Lance is out and his future is in doubt. Lance' girlfriend Darcy Sears (Ali Larter) starts trying to get Moxon.

27 April 2015,anaconda-40658,8," Varsity Isn't Blue.
","Varsity Blues (1999): Dir: Brian Robbins / Cast: James Van Der Beek, Jon Voight, Paul Walker, Ron Lester, Scott Caan: Sports comedy with screwball elements yet takes its theme seriously. It regards a football team that has lost its star quarterback to a leg injury and how James Van Der Beek steps in becoming their star player. His parents jerk him in several directions. His relationship with his girlfriend is in pearl. His best friend's girlfriend presents herself with whipped cream covering her vital areas. Sounds like he has his dating life well in hand. Coach Bud threatens to terminate his scholarship. Despite its familiar grounds this film is a must for football fans. Huge improvement for director Brian Robbins who previously made an embarrassing ham handed mess called Good Burger. Van Der Beek is effective as he attempts to figure out where his life is headed. Jon Voight steal scenes as Bud whom Van Der Beek confronts regarding particular conduct that moves the team ahead. Paul Walker plays the injured quarterback whom Van Der Beek replaces. Ron Lester brings comic relief as Van Der Beek's friend who ended up with more concussions than needed. Another comic performance is from the wild antics of Scott Caan that are this side of breaking the law. Great combination of football action combined with screwball comedy and a strong theme regarding the illegal operations to succeed. Score: 8 / 10",/review/rw2929640/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2016,A_Different_Drummer,8," Mainly because of Voight
","I will start by confessing that I have a weakness for football flicks. As a seasoned reviewer, I have over the years come to really admire the fact that American ""football"" films are not part of a single brand franchise tied to a particular studio but, rather, that any independent film-maker with a good script and financing can throw his hat in the ring. And produce something that may or may not pass the test of time.",/review/rw2929640/?ref_=tt_urv
