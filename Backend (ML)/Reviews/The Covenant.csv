4 March 2022,ronaldalamascus-90506,9," We loved this series!
","Okay, so it's not real heavy and the stories are simple instead of complicated but Provence is undoubtedly the star of the show and we get that in spades. Some of the characters are not the best actors but there is a certain je ne se quoi between the two main characters (played by Roger Allam and Nancy Carroll) that is believable and since we are in the same demographic, we can definitely relate. An added bonus is the role of Helene played by Keala Settle, who is quite different than the formula cops in most British crime series. Yes, the setting is in France and we have to believe that everyone (mostly) is French even though they are nearly all speaking in their distinctly English dialects and mannerisms. No violence, sex, cursing or gore but with all the prerequisite gays, mixed race relationships, and any other politically correct character necessary for a series today. Just lighthearted, whimsical dry wit and charm. Enjoy.",/review/rw7935029/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2022,Veritas99,9," Excellent for weekends...
","I like both lead characters, fine English humor, beautiful scenery...honestly, I don't care much about murders plots, I just enjoy the dialogue, slow rhythm and beautiful landscapes...I really don't need to see a movie with violence and gunshots those days...A little too PC, though.",/review/rw7935029/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2022,SunnyDaise,8," Bit low key
","With Roger Allam (Endeavour) and Nancy Carroll (Father Brown) in the lead roles, I was expecting this series to be a bit more engaging, but the plot wasn't anything special. This show is kind of a slightly swearier, less quirky version of The Madame Blanc Mysteries, but without the 'will-they-won't-they' romance as here the couple are already established, which works just as fine. There's nothing majorly wrong with MiP, but storywise I felt like I'd seen it all before. The best thing about both of these French-set detective series is having 50+ leads female and male, as that hasn't been done enough.",/review/rw7935029/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2022,ociopia,7," Almost but not quite
","This kind of British cozy is right up my alley and of course both leads are part of the repertoire. She for Father Brown and he for Endeavor. I have watched episode 1 and I feel they haven't quite got the rhythm. It's good but kind of like a Bentley with a flat tire. Are they aiming for The Thin Man? The dialogue is snappy, witty repartee but neither seem like its something they would really say, especially him. She is reprising her role from Father Brown, oh so bored and sophisticated, but it runs very wide of the mark. He's better but I find I can't believe he's from an ultra-rich Parisian family. Nevertheless, I kind of like it and I hope they settle in. I love the settings, her clothes are such fun and it has promise.",/review/rw7935029/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2022,Ziggy1965,7," It's not so bad. Let's see how the next episode is
",I am only watching it because of Roger Allam since I loved him in Endevour. Overall it was not so bad. The writing could have been tighter. Just find it difficult to keep track of the guest characters since they all have French names. Let's see what happens next as I feel it has some promise.,/review/rw7935029/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,adrian-458,9," Utterly gorgeous!
","As usual, the petty, small minded nay-sayers are out in force; ""It's too this, it's not like that, too long, too much talking blah blah blah"". Well, go and watch something American thing with guns and zombies and car chases.",/review/rw7935029/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2022,tomweir-85599,3," Terrible acting. Wooden dialogue.
",Some of the acting is so bad it made me laugh. It's so clunky and wooden that I thought it was a parody at times. The script is laughable. But the scenery is nice.,/review/rw7935029/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2022,meredithdanderson,8," Very enjoyable
","I have watched one episode so far and enjoyed it. The setting is beautiful and I liked the actors. I thought the plot was pretty good too, and I enjoyed the humor. This show reminds me of one of my favorites, Midsomer Murders!",/review/rw7935029/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2022,berkinet,3," Not ""Meurtres à...""
","Trying to copy a French policier with an English speaking, and acting, cast just doesn't work. It is not the accent that is off-putting, or even the quintessentially English expressions. The problem is these are very English characters who think and act like les Anglais not Les Francais.",/review/rw7935029/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2022,kms-91461,7," Endeavour cooked in Provence
","Slow cooking, slow investigation, rather a pretext than the real thing. Beauty of life, places food, wine, what not to enjoy. Do not expect a real criminal story, although it is there. Just relax and admire the location. Ang if you ever watched Father Brown, you will be happy to see Lady Felicia (Nancy Caroll) at her best.",/review/rw7935029/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2022,galuwatra,9," Fascinating mysteries with a back drop of a grown up love affair.
","I found this drama absolutely enthralling. The scenery was beautiful, acting superb and cases unique. As a woman, of a certain age, I appreciated the love between the two lead characters. There are lots of laughs, as a bonus.",/review/rw7935029/?ref_=tt_urv

26 May 2022,ferdinand1932,4," Gloucestershire
","Having exhausted charming locations for a series in the UK this one is basically set in Wiltshire, Hampshire, or Gloucestershire with posh people and antiques and fine food and wine (no opera, though) mooching about in an old fashioned mystery, like Lord Peter Wimsey, with garlic mayonnaise.",/review/rw7935029/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,rosemaryandthyme,6," Slow and Dull
","Something is not right with this series and I can't place my finger on it. Is it the scriptwriter who thinks she/him/their writing is so witty and clever..or is it Roger Allam's slow delivery that sounds as if he's reading from a script rather than acting? I expected more rural scenes of Provence not just buildings but maybe time will tell. Please stop pushing your political views as well, why reference the 2016 US election results for a series about murder in Provence. Slow, slow, dare I say boring plus the snooty and snobby leads; good grief what is happening to British television series these days..below par, I'm losing hope.",/review/rw7935029/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,SamPamBam,9," Pleasing light mystery
","Quite pleasing to see Nancy Carroll and Roger Allam team up in a mature, adult, and well done production. They are bound for success if enough adults discover it. Excellent production values, dialogue that does not revolve around today's vulgarities that are common with the current crop of millennial writers; in short one might find this a pleasant foray into the English Mystery Genre without the dreary windbags and shrieking stiff-upper-lippers that tend to so often gravitate to these roles.",/review/rw7935029/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2022,gee-15,8," A loaf of bread, a jug of wine and....murder!
","Roger Allam! Nancy Carroll! Patricia Hodge! I'm there. This mystery series about the dark, seething underbelly of.... Aix-en-Provence(!?), falls on that narrow line between angst-ridden detective series (see Inspector Morse) and not-to-be-taken-too-seriously ""cozy"" murder mysteries (see Midsomer Murders). I think the balance is just right. Allam plays an investigating judge (as per the inquisitorial judicial system of France) and Carroll plays a forensic psychologist who is also Allam's romantic partner. The two have nice chemistry and give off the vibe of a long-together couple. Hodge plays Carroll's opinionated, sarcastic mother who pops in from time to time. Keala Settle does well as the gruff but good-natured cop who works with Allam. Based on the first few episodes, the mystery plots are twisty and thematic (racism, misogyny etc are touched upon) , the scenery is gorgeous, and the wine is incredibly beautiful (and frequently consumed). My only criticism of this series is that Carroll is not given a bit more to do. Right now, she just kind of follows Allam around and acts as his sounding board.",/review/rw7935029/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2022,msghall,5," I'm 72 and too young for this talky, dirge-like series. Makes Midsomer Murders seems like Caligula.
","If you're over 72 you may enjoy this mopey, talky, yawn of a show. But if your heart is still strong and your life is still meaningful, you may want to skip this snorefest to avoid an early demise - of boredom.",/review/rw7935029/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2022,deesmellie,8," Started off slow
","The show started off slow, but has picked up the pace I've enjoyed it now that it has told a little of the main characters background it's gotten better. I hope they will give this show a chance and have more episodes.",/review/rw7935029/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2022,BILLYBOY-10,9," Another Fun Murder Series
","I love light hearted murder series with snappy repartee dialogue and quirky characters. Vera this is not! Nancy Carroll from Father Brown is perfectly matched with Roger Allam and the outdoor locations are beautiful so its a wonderful series and I hope it gets picked up for more. Probably not tho its
much to pedestrian for the gourmet viewer. Pity. Anyway I have to kill time to list at least 150 characters which is total nonsense as when I read a review it needs to be short and concise not filled with endless yack yack in useless detail.",/review/rw7935029/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2022,panfan54,9," Brilliant
",The scenery invites you in and the two leads make you stay for more. Nancy Carrol and Roger Allam are wonderful actors with great chemistry. The story lines roll with the scenery and remind me of the French Murder In series but with a gentler pace. Please make more!,/review/rw7935029/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,susanlc-63621,6," They're Supposed to be French
","It's an OK show, a little slow for me, But what I find most distracting is that the characters are supposed to be French. They have French last names, they live in a town in Provence, the signs are French, the police are supposed to be french but they are all English actors using English accents. It's just a misfit I find hard to get around.",/review/rw7935029/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2022,wls-389-809966,2," Mind numbing
","My wife and I just barely managed to endure the first episode. Mind you, we are British TV fans-oh, sorry, I guess we are supposed to imagine this is French. In an case, we found it tedious in almost every way-mind numbing at times. The characters were almost interesting, but the plot was B-grade. Zero entertainment value for us..",/review/rw7935029/?ref_=tt_urv
