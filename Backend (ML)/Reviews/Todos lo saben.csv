4 November 2009,kosmasp,9," Different kind of Beast
","No pun intended. I'm not going to spoil anything about the story, but it's safe to assume that you already know, what kind of character the main actor portrays. And of course being a priest while being ""naughty"" exaggerates all that. Plus this is the most erotic movie from Park Chan Wook yet.",/review/rw2127526/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2009,zetes,10," Every bit as good as the Vengeance trilogy
","From the director of Oldboy comes this slick vampire flick. Kang-ho Song stars as a priest who is accidentally changed into a vampire while being cured of a deadly, mysterious virus. His vampirism and priesthood are quite at conflict, but he is able to survive by robbing the hospital's blood bank and unconscious patients who might not mind some siphoned blood. Because of his supposedly miraculous survival, he comes into the lives of Ha-kyun Shin's family. Shin has cancer, and his mother believes that Song can cure it. Unfortunately, Song's vampirism raises his levels of lust to a height where he can't help but fall for Shin's young wife, OK-vin Kim. Kim is intensely interested in the world of vampirism, and the two become lovers. The film from there goes in weird directions that I think one should experience for themselves. What really should be mentioned is Chan-wook Park's mastery of the medium of cinema. My God, I've rarely seen such a masterful visual artist at the peak of his powers. The major flaw of the film is that it's a little incoherent, especially near the beginning. Park is interested in telling his stories mostly in the visuals, which can be difficult to follow at times. But when it works, man, does it fly. The film is also perversely hilarious. The final sequence, easily one of the best of the decade, is simultaneously heartbreaking and delightfully ridiculous. OK-vin Kim should become a worldwide star after this film. She gives one of the best performances of the year.",/review/rw2127526/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2009,tjackson,10," Romance, Religion, Madness, and lots of slurping
","Not for the squeamish, but the number of twists, inventive uses of situations using vampire mythology, gorgeous visual extremes, together with interesting and quirky characters make this one of the most stunning horror films I've ever seen. It descends into utter madness along with characters, but never seems exploitative or horrific without purpose. There are copious amounts of bloodletting accompanied by some nasty sucking and squishing sounds, but also subtle moments where you laugh out loud. As he tends to do, Chan-wook Park keeps you off center with leaps in time and plot and situation that you have to fill in for yourself forcing your involvement in the story and characters.

","More excellent film-making from Park Chan-wook, who shows no signs of flagging in his quest to bring his unique brand of inventive and unique movies to the world. This is his version of a traditional vampire movie, and while it's not quite as quirky as I'd expected from this director, it certainly packs a punch and proves a breath of fresh air in a cinematic world inundated by the latest Twilight movies.",/review/rw2127526/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2015,lasttimeisaw,7," A heretic genre piece from Park Chan-wook
","A vampire love story loosely based on Ã‰mile Zola's THERESE RAQUIN, Chan-wook Park's THIRST (its original Korean title literally means: bat) is a blood-soaked psychological thriller about a Catholic priest Sang-hyun (Song Kang-ho), after experiencing a death-defying recovery owing to an undisclosed blood transfusion during his volunteer mission to find a vaccine for a deadly virus, he becomes the only survivor among all the infected, which attracts many devotees to worship him as a miracle from God. But the reality is that a craving for human blood has been commenced after the incident, the virus is still plaguing him, his skin is afflicted with blisters, only human blood can prohibit the symptoms and turn him into a nighttime creature endowed with all its well-established trappings like self- recovery, human-exceeding agility and strength.

17 May 2010,Indyrod,9," One of the best recent takes on the vampire genre
","Talk about getting your socks knocked off, this newest amazing movie from Park Chan-wook's would be my favorite new take on the vampire genre, if not for ""Let the Right One In"", which still remains my fav, but this one is right behind it. A Catholic Priest volunteers for some radical medical experiments, that turn him into a vampire. He tries his best to be a good vampire, and not kill anybody, but it's pretty clear, that's going to be rather difficult. Park mixes in some black comedy into this one, just as he does in most of his earlier films, but the subject matter is dead serious. It also has one of the best vampire sex scenes I have ever seen. The vampire Priest steals blood from hospitals and anywhere he can find it, but when he meets his new lover, things pretty much go downhill, when she wants to become a vampire too. This is an excellent entry into the vampire genre, and continues Park Chan-wook's amazing body of work. This is not to be missed, every minute of the 134 min running time is entertaining as hell.",/review/rw2127526/?ref_=tt_urv

14 August 2009,yfguitarist,9," Beautiful, tragic, twisted, absurd, and darkly comic
","If you love Chan-wook Park, you know what to expect. His films are brutal, poetic, tragic, and artistic, with splashes of very grim humor. THIRST is clearly Park's style, and I loved every second of it, from the cinematography (every shot is gorgeous and creative) to the story, which blends Shakespearean tragedy, murderous love, Gothic horror, and layered character drama. The characters are complex and there is plenty of moral ambiguity to go around. Even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy. The direction is restrained and the performances are nuanced - like SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE, there are too many subtleties to take in on the first viewing. Chan-wook Park is an intelligent, bold, consistently surprising filmmaker. It's unpredictable - scenes go from brutal and heart-wrenching to laugh-out-loud hilarious in an instant. This is closer to LADY VENGEANCE then SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE as far as being over-the-top and comical. But, like LADY VENGEANCE, it's incredibly rich, thought-provoking, and rewarding.",/review/rw2127526/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2010,Tweekums,9," Something different from Park Chan-wook
","Having enjoyed previous films from director Park Chan-wook, The Vengeance Trilogy and I'm a Cyborg, I was keen to see what he would bring to the vampire genre; I was not disappointed. Kang-ho Song plays Sang-hyun, a Catholic who volunteers to take part in an experiment to find a vaccine an incurable disease. He catches the illness but unlike everybody else he survives after a blood transfusion and people believe he is a miracle worker. He soon discovers that he requires more blood if he isn't to relapse. Working in a hospital he gets the blood he needs from a coma patient. When he is invited to join in a game of mahjong with a childhood friend he realises blood isn't the only thing he thirsts for; he is drawn to his friend's wife Tae-ju. They are soon in a physical relationship and she tells him that her husband has been abusing her, in order to protect her he kills his friend during a fishing trip. Soon after the two lovers are haunted by the guilt of what they did and Kang-ho lets slip that she was not in fact abused; on learning this Kang-ho kills her but is so overcome with guilt that he gives her his own blood and she returns as a vampire. She is not like him however; she is not satisfied with blood stolen from the hospital blood bank and starts killing people. He may have given up the priesthood but he still believes that it is wrong to kill people so takes drastic action to prevent her from killing again.",/review/rw2127526/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2010,akkoziol,8," Not, not, NOT at all what I thought, pleasant surprise, Park excels again
","Now that I have seen it, it was NOT what I was expecting, at least not until the very END. I read some of the other reviews before picking up a used copy of this from Amazon and was glad I did. Having been first introduced to Park's work via Oldboy, I was curious to how he'd treat the genre and was rather pleased at the clever manner in which he executed it. I think Park has matured in terms of presentation because while Oldboy and some of his other work has very nice and deliberate camera work, he has some nice innovations in Bakjwi that I had not seen in other vamp movies. For example the scene where Father Hyeon is realizing the ""beast"" growing within him as he gives his shoes to the always barefoot Tae-ju and he is able to SEE the blood pumping through Tae-ju's skin and his eye's widen in blood-lust for it. That was a nice effect. I was also happy that Park did not CG the crap out of the movie and the is in fact very little CG at all. I came away from Bakjwi being totally set up to think one thing was going to happen and get taken for a ride in true Park fashion. Additionally, I liked that Park played with a little symbolism and reversal whereas we don't usually get this is Asia cinema. During the beginning of the movie we see the plot develop slowly and get to know the characters and you feel like an invisible observer to the thing that are transpiring. Park treats you a little like Ghost of Christmas future coming to show you, albeit a bit boringly, what life is like outside your world. Ah, but then we start to feel a little kinship with the befallen Father and his burgeoning lust for Tae-ju and conflict with duty as a priest. We almost start to root for them even until Park not so nicely slaps us back into reality and we really see that in the end Bakjwi is a movie about moral dilemma and right and wrong. It won't spoil it if I tell you to watch Bakjwi from the mindset of a priest and I think you'll come away from it with what Park wants you to come away with. Don't expect Oldboy and stylization because that's not what you'll get here. A very interesting take on the genre indeed. Those who missed the MANY literary elements and religious allusions watched some other movie, not Bakjwi. After Bakjwi, watch Let The Right One IN, it's also not what you'll expect either.",/review/rw2127526/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2009,udar55,5," Was hoping for more than vampire clichÃ©s from Park
","Color me seriously disappointed. The vampire genre received some exciting new blood (boo yourself!) with Tomas Alfredson's film adaptation LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, so the idea of Chan-wook Park, the director of OLD BOY, doing his take on a vampire movie was pretty exciting. Sadly, despite tons of rave reviews and great buzz, I found this to be a huge disappointment. First, it is completely unfocused. The film runs 133 minutes and a lot of that time is spent on nothing really. Second, and this is what bothered me the most, is the film is a walking vampire clichÃ©. The same old story of a girl finding out a vampire is so scary, yet so incredibly hot. The only saving grace here is that Song brushes his hair. Actually, I think he is quite good in the lead role (be thankful I didn't say he got to ""sink his teeth into the role"") but the script offers him little in terms of conflict. I think he is upset about keeping his celibacy vows for a few minutes and then spends the next hour and a half humping away. When he finally converts his charge, she unrealistically goes from mousy to bitchy monster in a finger snap. Again, it all works into a big pile of ""Eh"" for me.",/review/rw2127526/?ref_=tt_urv

6 September 2012,MissOceanB,8," Wow! Fantastic.
","Thirst: A bit speechless. Where to begin reviewing this film? Well, it is certainly a fantastic Thriller, some elements of Horror and Gore. It is unlike any film I have seen, and I have seen it all! Psychological, disturbing, creepy at times, culturally quite accurate (Korean), a must see for fans of Vampirism for sure, but also anyone that wants to see a disturbing, complex, form of a Thriller. I have not seen any other films by this Director but I certainly will be doing so now. Thirst has a bit of everything in it - not strictly about vampires by far. And to those reviews that mention that it is ""Twilight"" for adults? You have it wrong. It is nothing like Twilight. Yes, there are some similar traits but no, it is not a Vampire Romance...it is SO much more than that and the other positive reviews are bang-on and speak for themselves. I particularly enjoyed the character developments, the struggles with faith, family, friends as well as the eerie facial expressions. What a creative and well-written story.

","Might end up being the biggest disappointment that I will see in 2009. I seem to be the rare person who disliked Park's Oldboy, but I think that his ""Lady Vengeance"" and ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"" are among the best films I've seen in the 2000's decade. Therefore, I really was looking forward to see this, especially as it got such positive reviews. Instead, I found the film clichÃ©d, and broke little, if any new ground to the vampire genre.

1 August 2009,Quinoa1984,9," one of a handful of vampire films to treat it as a disease
","The great thing about Thirst, Chanwook Park's latest film, is that it's the anti-Twilight. Some of you may take that as a minus, but in reality it's a big plus. Park takes the method of vampirism seriously, and as well the torrid love story between Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo. We see the conflicts of both of the characters- Sang-hyeon being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that, unbeknownst to him, turns him into a sickly but true-blue vampire, and Tae-Joo with her mother and ""idiot"" brother, the latter is killed by Sang- as in a very strong melodrama. There's nothing terribly weepy or insipid with the story and characters at any point, and the implications put forth from religion early on (Sang, for example, is seen as a healer of sorts since he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism, even as he just can't be that and knows it) on top of those about good vs evil, push it up into another plane cinematically.",/review/rw2127526/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2010,chaos-rampant,," Chan-wook Park's take on the vampire film
","There's a lot of stuff about repression here. A priest trying to come to terms with his newfound vampire bloodthirst, an alienated girl smothered by the middle-aged woman and her needy pathetic son who brought her up. Like the broken pieces of a puzzle, these two people figure together in awkward ways and romance erupts, wild fiery messy passion full of bloody bites and slushing sounds. We also get crime details painted with broad noirish brushstrokes; a murder the two protagonists are trying to keep under wraps, the mother who knows who murdered her son but can't say anything about it to anyone because she's paralyzed by stroke. All this is hastily nailed together with planks and long rusty spikes made of very very dark humor, so that if Thirst was a staircase it would creak and make lots of noise and you wouldn't trust it to support your weight to the top.",/review/rw2127526/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2009,DICK STEEL,7," A Nutshell Review: Thirst
","The response to Park Chan-wook's Thirst is nothing less than polarizing. You either love it like one of my friends who rated it amongst the best he'd seen, or you loathe it like another who had staged a walkout. Personally I do not think this film deserved such a negative response, however, it did get a little indulgent at times, and schizophrenic too in its narrative, but had its moments which basically boiled down to the power wielded by and given to the female of the species, and the havoc that it creates.",/review/rw2127526/?ref_=tt_urv
