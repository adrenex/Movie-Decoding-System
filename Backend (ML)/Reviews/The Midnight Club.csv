5 December 2005,dee.reid,," This is good, though many have already missed the point, which isn't surprising
","With his basketball-sized afro and genius I.Q., you'd never guess that 10-year-old Huey Freeman is WAY beyond his years. His 8-year-old brother Riley isn't of equal intelligence but what he lacks in that area he makes up for in attitude. Both young boys, the revolutionary-in-training Huey and the hip-hop-loving, hustler-in-training Riley, are moved from the big city to the 'burbs to live with their grandfather, and chaos ensues.",/review/rw1815936/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2005,HyperPup,," Afrocentric satire par none
","Having read and watched both the print and televised versions of the Boondocks I can honestly say, to me it was a diamond in the rough...until now. The antics and sometime semantics of the lead characters Huey, Riley and Grandpa are enough to keep ones funny bone in stitches while at the same time sending a message to the viewer loud and clear. The message is that no matter what color, no matter what creed or race....everyone is F'ed UP! I know the brothas and sistas will be jammin on how Huey is sticking it to the white man and so on, but that is only one side of the equation for the story often shows the illogic and humor of how African Americans view life. A stinging indictment on how the gov't seeks to obstruct and keep down the black man gives way to portrayals of black men stereotyping one another with colorful and racial epithets. The mocking vision of white males acting like black gansta rappers melts into the savage humor of hoes and pimps and black men and gun play. Its the long stretch and cleansing breath of the soul the racial landscape of America has needed for a long time. No one is perfect and this show is unafraid to show that no matter what color or ideology , that you have a bullseye on your back when Huey and Riley come around!",/review/rw1815936/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2006,Agent10,10," A biting, Leftist commentary on society
","Aaron McGruder is an admitted militant liberal, and his comic strip has provided quite an insight into his world view on politics and the lack of political tactfulness. But the television show has effectively upped up the ante, making even starker commentary on society and the racist ills that have fallen on it.",/review/rw1815936/?ref_=tt_urv

3 February 2015,bmoore07,8," The Last African-American Cartoon Classic
","The title of this show is an interesting one because the show's setting isn't exactly in 'the boondocks' of American society. The Boondocks is about two children named Huey and Riley Freeman who move from the ghettos of Chicago to the fictional, peaceful (and very white) neighborhood of Woodcrest, where they embark on hilarious misadventures with their grandfather Robert Freeman as they adjust to their new environment.",/review/rw1815936/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2005,Adolphe_Menjou,," great comedy which will leave you laughing with gasps!!

15 May 2006,cchamber,9," Not for all viewers
","This show is ""black"" comedy in multiple senses of the term. Here is a memorable example. Grandad opens a restaurant featuring a menu high in fat, pork, sugar, and serving sizes. Huey comments that the food is ""destructive"" to those that eat it. Grandad asks him, ""What's wrong with you boy, this is your culture."" To which Huey responds, ""well then the culture's destructive!"" Now that's a point worthy of consideration coming out of the mouth of a small child in a cartoon. Personally, I think its worth watching several hours of this show just for the reward of being challenged to think about that one line, but others will not agree. My wife hates the show because, in her opinion ""its simply not funny."" I must agree, that the writing is bit uneven. Uncle Ruckus's trip to ""white heaven"" and King's speech at his political rally are absolutely priceless, while the entire episode ""Let's Nab Ophrah"" was a complete waste of time when Samuel L. Jackson's character wasn't talking. I strongly expect the reviews of this show to be highly polarized - you either love it or hate it. Watch a few episodes and make up your own mind.",/review/rw1815936/?ref_=tt_urv

17 July 2015,corazontvc,8," How exactly did they get away with this?
","That's the question I keep asking myself. My favorite character is Uncle Ruckus. How in the hell did this get onto relatively mainstream television is completely beyond me. Today, this would have howls of twitter protests and nervous nancies screaming at the top of their lungs. Thank God there was a time when artists were allowed to take risks.",/review/rw1815936/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2006,kenny5637,10," The best show for society
","This is Adult Swim's most socially conscious and possibly most clever show. It's loaded with parallels to real world events. (A convenience store robbery works as a perfect metaphor for the early stages of Iraqi Freedom.) There are also heavy doses of Eastern influences, with references to Japanese cinema (Zatoichi, specifically) and action scenes comparable to what you'd normally only see in anime. The heavy dosage of quality hip hop is also refreshing. Aaron McGruder is man with good tastes, and they help to make his material so brilliant.",/review/rw1815936/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2012,Rectangular_businessman,9," Excellent series
","In my opinion, ""The Boondocks""( along with ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" and ""The Legend of Korra"") is one of the best anime-influenced cartoon, which is able to take the best elements of Japanese and American animation in order to create something different and well made. Instead of only using the most characteristic anime elements big water drops in a shallow way, this series uses the anime aesthetic in a original and different way, with very interesting and stylish results. There is huge improvement in the animation quality in the second season, but it is the surprisingly good writing what makes this series to be so great.",/review/rw1815936/?ref_=tt_urv

9 November 2005,digriz60,," Thoughtful Comedy with Southpark Edge
","I have read none of the Boondocks comic strips, although I've heard of its periodic controversy. Speaking strictly about the Adult Swim cartoon, it has relevant social commentary, enveloped in engaging characters and delivered with pointed, unforgiving humor. Yes, there is definitely a political agenda being prescribed by the writers, and occasionally is a bit too expository (Reagan was the devil, Jesus was black), which may reflect MacGruders political views, but was also included for shock value. From a critical reader's point of view (ignorning politics), the strip suffers from the same periodic 'lets see how much we can rile up the readers' statement. I love shock, but bad exposition can seem as out of place as a clown at a funeral. That aside, I think the first episode tackled some pretty thorny subjects, which included a hilarious exchange that highlighted an undercurrent of class division in some segments of the black community, and a rather poignant ending, where the rich white banker is bonded to Grandpa by their old school moral values. I was completely expecting the Garden Party to be another Rich-white-guy-setting-up-the-out-of-place-minority-for-humiliation gag, but it veered far from that, gaining my true admiration. I see a great future for this show if he can keep it funny and not degenerate into the over the top lunacy some edgy shows adopted in their later years.",/review/rw1815936/?ref_=tt_urv

16 November 2005,bob the moo,," Matches the humour and consistency of the strip (and yes, that is a good and a bad thing)
","School kids Huey and Riley move out of the city to live with their grandfather in the suburbs. The predominately white area provides a more stable environment but it is not going to be easy for the family to fit in. Huey immediately sees neo-conservative conspiracies at every step, while Riley is determined to keep it real and be thugged out - even though the streets are far from gritty. Meanwhile both boys only drive their grandfather to despair.",/review/rw1815936/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2005,alainajo_4,," Boondocks is a hit to stay
","I waited for this comic strip to be made into a cartoon. We all have read the comic strips unless your town is 1 of 350 people to pull the cartoon, and know how Aaron speaks his mind following the Declaration of Independence. Huey is that educated future black panther leader that every republican fears, and Riley is what my Mom probably fears me bringing home seeing that he's a wanna-be hardcore rapper. Granddad is just, to hilarious. He's that man who's lived through the time when blacks had to go through racism and the unfair treatment to get the rights that we have today, although he missed out on one of the marches since he went to get his raincoat so he wouldn't get wet. Now he's welling to please every white person that comes around him just so he'll be in good when he has troubles. He's even figured out that the white man has a weakness for guess what................cheese! If you don't like this show something is wrong with you, but we are able to have our own opinions. So freedom to the American man. And the creator of the show is so cute because he looks like Huey. So heres to a healthy run of the best cartoon.",/review/rw1815936/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2005,Tresix,9," More vulgar than the comic strip, but still worth watching.
","I had been a fan of Aaron McGruder's comic strip ""The Boondocks"" since its debut. The strip drew controversy because of the way it deals with current events such as the Bush Administration, the war in Iraq, Hurricane Katrina, to name a few. It also takes great jabs at racial stereotyping of many cultures. Some newspapers put the strip in the editorial section instead of the comics due to its subject matter. ""The Boondocks"" now makes the leap from the funny pages to television via the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim line-up. After viewing the first episode, it's safe to say there are quite a few changes that have been made from the strip. It is a little more on the vulgar side than its print counterpart. The strip and show deal with the same cast of characters: Huey Freeman (voiced by Regina King) and his younger brother Riley (also voiced by King) are two young boys from the South Side of Chicago who go to live with their grandfather Richard (the always hilarious John Witherspoon) in the suburbs. Being thrown into an environment of mixed races doesn't exactly set well with the boys: Huey is a militant-type who wants to shake up the Establishment while Riley is a gangsta-wannabe. Both drive Grandpa up the wall with their antics. The show's first episode, entitled ""Garden Party"", allows each character to jell into their roles. As the show starts, Huey tells the audience about a dream he has where he tells whites at a garden party that ""Jesus was black, Ronald Reagan was the Devil and the government is lying about 9-11. Thank you."" These comments send ""Whitey"" into a panic. However, when he makes the same comments in at a real garden party, he's only commended for being an articulate speaker, much to Huey's chagrin. Riley, meanwhile, meets an Iraq War veteran and is only interested in shooting one of his guns.",/review/rw1815936/?ref_=tt_urv

","This show should have ended immediately after Aaron MacGruder left. The first season was easily deserving of a 10, the second season a fairly strong follow-up, the third season watchable.

","Young Huey, and Riley Freeman move from the Boondocks of Chicago, to the suburban city of Woodcrest, with Robert ""Granddad"" Freeman. As they attempt to assimilate with the new life, their life behind them often is reflected, shown in the repression of Huey, the oldest, and for Riley, the youngest, it is another adventure! From saving a gangster from a mob hit squad, to getting into a shoot out at a local mini-mart, they are still strangers in this new, slow world, and they have only their friends, their granddad, and the timely brother to brother understanding to survive.",/review/rw1815936/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2007,Ryu_Darkwood,8," Behind the facade of controversy, it is a very moving and intelligent show
","I like this show for being critical towards both the black community as well as the white community. Spiritual father McGruder doesn't choose one side, but is showing the dubious way of thinking of members of both sides. He's showing us the outrageous injustice done towards black people as well as the utter dumbness of rappers and their gangster-culture.",/review/rw1815936/?ref_=tt_urv

","I started with the comic strip by Aaron McGruder, so when the animation came out I was all in. ""The Boondocks"" is hi-la-ri-ous. Regina King expertly voices both Riley and Huey while John Witherspoon was great as Grandpa. And then there was Uncle Ruckus (Gary Anthony Williams).

","I heard of this show from my cousin who insists on repeating the line ""tell santa he gone pay what he owe"" which is by the very funny. I like what I see and examination of urban culture and some of the ignorance that is proliferated and passed off as ""black"". It is highly unfortunate that most people upon watching will simply hear the N-word and a lot of cussing and be either highly offended or extremely amused with out seeing the value of this satire. I think this is a learning period, where culture is examined blown up and fit back together and people are left asking the question who am I really. My hope and I believe that shows aim is to show people that they are not required to continue a lifestyle that is immature and counter productive or as the show might put it they don't have to act like Ni**as",/review/rw1815936/?ref_=tt_urv
