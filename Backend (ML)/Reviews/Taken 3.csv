6 May 2020,jared-25331,9," Watch the extended version! It's awesome!
","This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film.",/review/rw3808077/?ref_=tt_urv

",I heard bad reviews about this movie but wanted to see the DC movie universe in prep for The Justice a league Snyder cut. Overall I really liked it. Felt that Batman was darker than usual (didn't think he killed people but a does a few times in this movie). Over all it's a great super hero movie.,/review/rw3808077/?ref_=tt_urv

","No idea why this page still has such bad reviews, even after we have the extended cut. The theatrical cut really doesn't do it justice. Absolutely loved the movie, beautiful cinema!",/review/rw3808077/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2021,waqassaleem-85201,7," Extended Cut- Outstanding
",The first Batman v Superman movie I saw was the extended cut and it was incredible. I loved this film. The story was good. Loved all the dc Easter eggs in the film. The only thing that I didn't like was Jesse eisenberg as lex luthor. He is a great actor but him as lex luthor just didn't work. Other than that I highly recommend watching the extended cut other than the regular version.,/review/rw3808077/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2017,rsathyadav,10," A once in a lifetime movie (BVS ultimate edition)
","I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of ""extra"" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. ",/review/rw3808077/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2017,whitnale,10," Watch Extended cut, not theatrical
","The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well.",/review/rw3808077/?ref_=tt_urv

8 September 2021,SPZMaxinema,8," Not a bad movie! Definitely do not regret watching!
","While there are some moments that don't make a whole lot of sense with characters and plot points, I really liked Ben Affleck as Batman and Jeremy Irons as Alfred! While the portrayal of Lex Luther was disappointing at some moments it worked! And who can forget the beautiful Gal Gadot?? I'd say it gets a bit too much hate.",/review/rw3808077/?ref_=tt_urv

25 March 2016,ThomasDrufke,7," Sloppy, Misleading, And Disappointing, With Some Incredible Moments Mixed In
","Well, the wait is finally over. Batman and Superman are in a big screen film together for the first time in history. The result? A sloppy attempt at setting up the DC Universe. Batman v Superman has its moments though with great performances from almost every one and action that could rival Man of Steel, but it was difficult to not walk out of this film and feel overwhelmingly disappointed. For a film that finished filming over a year ago, you would think Zack Snyder and Warner Bros would make all the effort in the world to edit in and out the stuff that's important and tighten the movie, but that isn't the case.

29 March 2016,classicsoncall,9," ""Bruce Wayne, meet Clark Kent, I love it"".
","Sorry if I can't get too worked up one way or the other regarding these super-hero films. I approach them as entertainment and on that score this one filled the bill. It's not required to have seen ""Man of Steel"" to understand the full nuance of Batman's (Ben Affleck) distrust of Superman (Henry Cavill) in ""Dawn of Justice"", but it doesn't hurt. I caught both films pretty much back to back so for me it was like one long story. What I particularly liked seeing was the insinuation of future characters in the unfolding universe, Flash and Aquaman were on quick display here. Gal Gadot had an impressive appearance as Wonder Woman in the film, the way she teamed up with the titled heroes to take down Doomsday was done effectively. I had read a fair number of reviews on this board and no one mentioned how this one ended, so I won't spoil it either. By now though, we know for a certainty that death in comics or the movies is no longer as certain as taxes, and that final little blip before the credits roll inform us that all's well in the next chapter. With everything else going on, the best sight gag in the story by a street protester was an effective commentary on the state of immigration in the country today: Superman = Illegal Alien. I guess it depends which side of the fence you're on.",/review/rw3808077/?ref_=tt_urv

","(Ultimate edition)
At the end of the day it's a matter of opinion and I wished that the majority of people saw the movie the way I saw it which was not the case. Maybe people came to this movie expecting another superhero movie with a lot of action and epic moments and not expecting a thought provoking one which made them hate it. And if you think about it this theme of testing your characters, putting them under impossible odds and making them react in very ""human"" ways started in Man of Steel.",/review/rw3808077/?ref_=tt_urv

29 March 2016,tavm,8," Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was pretty entertaining much of the time
","I admit I dreaded this movie since I first heard of this being made and while watching it, part of me still wasn't too enamored of some of what was going on concerning the characters of Superman and Batman. Let me also admit that I have yet to watch the previous Zack Snyder/Henry Cavill Superman movie, Man of Steel. Still, there's plenty of cool action and also many touching scenes especially those between Supes and Lois Lane, who in this one already knows Clark Kent's identity unlike what I previously knew of them from comics thorough the '70s-'80s not to mention the Christopher Reeve movies. My movie theatre-working friend possibly liked it more than I did (he clapped during some of the action scenes) but I didn't come away from this thinking it was worthless...just wondering why certain scenes were done the way they were. Really, I'll just say that for much of the time, I enjoyed Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and leave it at that. Also, Ben Affleck was as good as he could be as Batman and I felt he was okay as Daredevil way back in '03 as well. Okay, I'm done...",/review/rw3808077/?ref_=tt_urv

","I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say ""clumsy"" moments.

7 December 2018,Holt344,9," Ultimate Cut is the true experience, an epic and superb story - My Ultimate Review
","After watching it for the fifth time, forth with the Ultimate Cut I can say I love the story, tone and almost everything about the movie except for the writing for Lex and some minor things but the overall feeling of the movie makes up for it. Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL created a soundtrack that fits the movie perfectly. The characters from Man of Steel is improved and is overall better and the addition of Ben Affleck's Batman, Jeremy Irons' Alfred and other characters creates a great ensemble cast and the actors bring great and memorable performances. My take on the story is that it is really realistic, Superman would be seen as a god in a way and I agree fully with Batman's thoughts, look at the Injustice games/comics, simply great writing. The production design has the same quality of ""Man of Steel"", in other words quite brilliant production design. I'll say the same about the costume and prop department. The cinematography is another highlight of mine.",/review/rw3808077/?ref_=tt_urv
