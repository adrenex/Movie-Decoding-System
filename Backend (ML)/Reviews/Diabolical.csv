13 December 2018,Vartiainen,7," A side story from a greater universe
","Prospect, directed by Zeek Earl and Chris Caldwell, is a tale you could see on the fringes of a larger story. It tells about a young teenage girl, played by Sophie Thatcher, who lands on a distant planet with her dad (Jay Duplass), to hunt and harvest precious gemstones that might be their ticket to better life and prosperity. But, on the outer planets, you run into all sorts of danger.",/review/rw4476595/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2019,just_in_case,10," It being a good movie seems like a bonus.
","What floored me the most about this film was the attention to detail. This is how you make small budget scifi. Its a shame that so many indie scifi films are brought low by a focus on story and forgetting immersion. This movie is downright filthy. Every piece of technology looks used and beat up, lived in and thats so important. Whomever was in charge of set design, bravo. Its original star wars, blade runner, MOON, MONSTERS quality set design and costumes. These are poor miners and mercenaries. Every piece of gear should look rusty, hand cobbled and it does. This movie looks soooooo good. Even the main planet scenery, which could easily be a familiar tropic bog has this beautiful filter and light effect over it that makes it stand out as other worldly. They took the time to create familiar yet other worldy music like something out of cowboy bebop. Jazzy, hispanic, asian sounds whether real or not feel foreign. They created a separate written language just for consoles and sketchpads, never even calling it out(they did that in Star Wars, look it up.) The dedication to worldbuilding in this movie is just jaw dropping. I love the cobbled together rifle that uses hand charging batteries. The aesthetic reminds me a bit of these old scifi shows/films from the 80-90 cyber revolution Desert Punk and Zeiram.",/review/rw4476595/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2020,pabstcanrocketship,," Roadside Picnic for the intergalactic age
","Prospect is a slow burn of a film. It's the kind of film that asks for a viewer who is willing to appreciate the subtle but deft world-building and peculiarly literate dialog. This is not cheap-thrills scifi, but neither is it navel gazing pedantry. It's a clear story of an often tense struggle in a treacherous and foreign setting.",/review/rw4476595/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2019,umimelectric,8," Tense & Unique Sci-Fi Tale
","I had no idea that this film existed and when I learned of it I had to immediately give it a watch. I'd take true science fiction over an epic space battle or alien invasion any day. I absolutely LOVE the look and feel of this film...obviously futuristic but in a dirty, mechanical way- no polish to be found here. The sound/music is fantastic, and shots from outer space are surprisingly impressive. If you're a big fan of CGI or mind-blowing cinematography then you may feel underwhelmed by this, and that's OK. It's something different though, and it's one of the more intense and gripping stories I've seen in some time. Love the realistic action of the gunplay; these weapons are certainly from tomorrow but there's no pew pew here. They seem unreliable, and difficult to fire, though extremely deadly if your aim is true. Sophie Thatcher provides a breakout turn as an unlikely heroine among a crew of male characters who are all less than noble in their own ways, mostly being driven by greed and desperation. I expect to see more from her as her young career continues. 8/10 overall, but it's a 10/10 if exclusively considered next to other smaller-scale science fiction pictures.",/review/rw4476595/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2019,El_Jefe,8," Solid, small-budget sci-fi
","This isn't space battles, explosions, and flashy visual effects. Instead, it's a well-acted story about people, that happens to be set in an interplanetary context. Great aesthetic and prop design, an interesting mix of futuristic and retro.",/review/rw4476595/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2021,RosanaBotafogo,9," Charismatic and engaging, adorable...
","Very good, I love movies in style, beautiful graphics, creative script, tense atmosphere, not much answers, more questions than answers, but captivating and interesting, the kind of fiction I love, simple and efficient, charismatic and engaging, adorable... the protagonist with the antagonist, cute...",/review/rw4476595/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2019,soundoflight,7," Superb Hard Sci-Fi Flick
","Modern science fiction films are, mostly, not really science fiction at all. Most of it is really space-fantasy, with laser cannons, explosions, space craft zipping around, fantastic monsters/aliens, etc. None of that is found in ""Prospect."" This film is grounded in a gritty reality that is extremely believable, more so than in any science fiction film I can remember seeing. In the novel world, stories that stick to some semblance of known scientific fact are known as ""hard"" sci-fi. Now, to be fair, there isn't a lot of science on display in ""Prospect"" - it's mostly action, but I will take what I can get! In case you can't tell, I've very much in favour of there being more films like this out there.",/review/rw4476595/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2021,Tweekums,7," A fun little sci-fi with western tropes
","Damon and his teenage daughter, Cee, are heading to a forested moon where they hope to strike it rich prospecting for precious gems. It won't be easy though; the air must be filtered due to toxic spores and anybody they encounter is unlikely to be friendly. Things go wrong from the start; their lander is damaged as they enter the atmosphere and they miss their intended landing site by some way. An early encounter leaves Cee on her own; if she is to survive and get off the moon again she will have to make an unlikely alliance.",/review/rw4476595/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2019,bOOnish,8," Recommended! (But obviously polarising)

7 November 2018,Eclectic-Boogaloo,7," A breath of fresh air

5 February 2019,MoistMovies,9," A diamond in the rough. After a long wait for release, it lived upto expectations.

6 March 2019,kosmasp,8," Science Fiction Road movie
","Although I guess technically since there are not roads on foreign (alien) planets, this term is sort of wrong. But you get where I'm going with the summary line I'm sure. After an initial slow start, things get mixed up when two unlikely pair of people clash (or is it ""meet"") each other. It's not that the pace goes frantic after that encounter, but the stakes get raised.",/review/rw4476595/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2020,simonbolton-81293,8," Great sci-fi on a budget
","A really good film, if you are expecting Star Wars, move on
Much more story driven sci FI that doesn't rely on special effects to tell a story
Well worth a watch",/review/rw4476595/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2019,Vic_max,," Nothing really happens ... in terms of sci-fi
","Despite an excellent atmospheric start, the story could have been told in any number of settings and at in any point in time. It hardly calls for a sci-fi setting.",/review/rw4476595/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2019,robertemerald,9," One to watch out for
","Every now and then one comes across a movie that sufficiently impresses, that you tell yourself you'll pay attention to anything else the writers or the Director does in the future. Prospect is one such movie. The story is a clever idea, not totally original, but with an almost a Western feel which certainly works, much like Young Ones (2014). Once dressed up with great planetary graphics, great spaceship sets, cool, if hardy, gadgets, a believable planet (though some more cgi would have helped), great camera work, good editing, good lighting, wonderfully chosen soundscape, and well chosen and highly committed actors......well, it's a cool winner. Great mid-budget sci-fi movie.",/review/rw4476595/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2019,bogusmcnuts,9," A rare treat: real sci-fi without pretension or the usual stupidities
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It tells a fairly simple but very engaging proper sci-fi story in a way that makes it refreshingly easy to suspend disbelief: no really stupid bad science or cheesy overblown SFX, and very little clunky exposition (apart perhaps from a little by the dad early on).",/review/rw4476595/?ref_=tt_urv

10 February 2019,bbooth-44926,," Superlative....Science Fiction as was Intended
","Simple, believable, and without unnecessary fluff, the story draws you into this young girls challenges while coming of age.
As if reading an early science fiction short, you are provided just enough information to move the story along, and are left to your imagination to characterize the individuals and draw your own moral implications from their actions.
In this age of high budget, force fed conclusions and extravagant special effects....some trust has been placed in the audience. I like that.",/review/rw4476595/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2020,ajzeg,7," Hey, it's Pedro Pascal in space! Wait, this isn't The Mandalorian.
","No, it's Prospect, an indie sci-fi film that had its wide release in 2019. Well, it looks like a sci-fi, it has spacesuits and spaceships and an alien planet with a ton of sci-fi nonsense in the dialogue, but don't be fooled. This movie is a western, another Mandalorian similarity. It has prospectors, settlers, outlaws, rivals and untamed wilderness! Using a 50s and 60s retro sci-fi aesthetic to tell a western story was really interesting and fun to watch. This movie is on the slower side, it has a lot of long shots of just pretty scenery, but the action is definitely worth sitting through the movie for. It's bloody and brutal! The effects are really damn good for having such a low budget. It uses a lot of practical effects with minimal CGI. You get the sense that they really are on an alien world when it's really just a forest. The performances were great and the character dynamics were interesting. The story is simple, but it works. Overall, this is a good movie. Check it out if you like westerns or retro sci-fi!",/review/rw4476595/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2019,grenage,8," Hard science fiction, nice place, good cast.

","If youre easily taken by tiniest hint of si fi movies, this one you should try out.it is taking place in space,on a mineral rich planet,that are uninhabitabel for humans to live,so survival systems has to be used. you get a feel of jarjar binks atmosphere, or like the good old cold war feel when viewing this film.",/review/rw4476595/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2018,PhilipGHarris,8," Less is More
","Prospect never tries to deny its roots. A space Western crossed with a Scifi movie which seems to have somehow escaped from the height of the 70's. Giving a gripping tale of a prospectors daughter and the slowly developing relationship that grows between her and her father's killer. The first order of business, to survive!",/review/rw4476595/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2020,maggielovitt-57720,9," Masterclass in World Building
","Prospect was the feature debut for writer-director team Christopher Caldwell and Zeek Earl and proved to be an ambitious masterclass in simplistic worldbuilding. It began as a humble Kickstarter funded short film which debuted at SXSW in 2014 and grew into a 4 million dollar feature film starring Pedro Pascal. The film proves that the sci-fi genre doesn't have to consist of large budget, CGI-heavy stories with overwrought plots.",/review/rw4476595/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2018,bbretall-1,8," A real departure from the average sci-fi film.
","This is a wonderful ""hard sci-fi"" film about a father-daughter team that lands on a forest moon in search of gems, but there is a clock ticking. They need to get back into orbit before the big ship that carried them out into this system leaves.
Great acting by teenager Sophie Thatcher and Pedro Pascal as the rogue the father/daughter team encounter. The beautifully shot sequences in a forest with lots of particulate ""dust"" in the air at all times was a great counterpoint to the gritty reality of day-to-day survival without too much advanced pseudo-science gear. It was refreshing to see a film where people are on an alien world (in this case a forest moon) that does NOT have a breathable atmosphere and thus have to wear spacesuits and worry about the attendant issues of being on an alien world and being able to make it home, things most sci-fi just seems to make into a non-issue... where every planet has a breathable atmosphere, or at worst requires a tiny filter actors wear over their mouth/nose.",/review/rw4476595/?ref_=tt_urv
