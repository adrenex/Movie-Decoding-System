17 April 2020,rryouse,7," Season One in Review.
","In spite of some negative comments I'll make below, it's important to note that I did enjoy LEGO Masters and would watch it again if it comes back for a second season. However there are some real issues with the show #1 of which is that they don't show you enough of the building process or enough of the final creations. Which while somewhat understandable early on when there were more teams, got more annoying towards the end when they should've had plenty of time to pan around the builds slowly to show us as much as they could. In short please give us more LEGO and less drama in season two.",/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2020,niches493,7," Wish it was more about LEGO...
",The first episode was very promising but the second episode is mainly drama with a sprinkling of LEGO. How about a LEGO competition show where we get to see all the models in detail.,/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2020,bryon_goff,7," Cheesy, but worth it.
","I'll make this short and to the point. The LEGO building is amazing! The writing and jokes are not. Their is terrible, unnecessary drama and people crying ALL THE TIME for dumb reasons. This would've been better as a straight up reality competion instead of a scripted, melodramatic-""try hard to make the audience chuckle""-type show. I do reccomend though because the creations are stunning!",/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2020,gareth-75442,5," YAY LEGO.... BOO TRASH REALITY TV GARBAGE
","Lego masters, brilliant show concept shoved into trashy scripted US reality TV show, why oh why use the same tired garbage reality TV module that's been seen with all the US cake shows, granny's acting like kids, over the top show host spewing bad gags & every contestant acting like kids on a sugar rush, the only positive about this show is the lego.
Good idea executed really stupidly.",/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2020,socrfan-60834,5," Could be better.
","I like Will Arnett and the basis for the show. Problem is it follows the same script too many shows like it do (Hell's Kitchen is a perfect example). Gimmicky over the top contestants, sitting around talking throughout the show. Too much flash and flair instead of just getting down to the competition. It just starts to feel scripted. Hope it improves.",/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2020,jonadbell,3," Hope they read these reviews
",I LOVE LEGO! I was so excited when I heard about this show. One of the greatest things about LEGO is seeing how people build different things with them. Unfortunately this is not what we are getting in the first episodes. Instead of focusing on creativity and the amazing build process the producers are focused entirely on the weird cast and playing up their eccentricities and emotions. I think LEGO fans would rather watch builders figuring out how to make stuff than watch them sniveling about the time constraints and the possibility of letting down their partner.,/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2020,trashcanracer,4," Could be so good...I said COULD BE...
","No one (besides MAYBE their families) wants to be invested in these contestants, so let's get to why most of us tuned-in to begin with: LEGO!!! Bottom line: less horrible acting by horrible actors and more Lego building!!!",/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2020,McQualude,5," So fake it almost seems real
","The show is way over produced with loud dramatic music, animation, perfectly manicured and coached contestants playing characters, the newlyweds, the underprivileged, the grannies, the nerds, and so on; every one with a story. The focus is on Will Arnett and guest judge. Between Arnett doing uncle jokes there are brief flashes of Lego construction with lots of concern and hand wringing over whether the contestants will finish, which they always do somehow, and friendly jibes between contestants. The Lego constructions are sometimes shown in animation that looks almost real which makes one wonder how much is real. In episode 2, Arnett smashes Lego constructions, maybe, something looks off, the unsmashed remainder doesn't match between shots vs the ""slow motion replay"" which is certainly animation. The end product is a show that looks fake top to bottom, I definitely don't buy it and so feel no investment.",/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2020,atlasmb,7," Playful Competition
","""Lego Masters"" is a competition show in which ten teams of two builders each compete for $100,000. In the pilot, host Will Arnett introduces the two judges and explains the concept of the ""golden brick""---awarded to the winner of the day's competition, it gives that team immunity from elimination when redeemed.",/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2020,benjt122,1," Too much drama. Not enough Lego
","I love the idea of this show, but there's wayyy too much drama that is clearly fabricated. I mean come on. How dumb do they think we are? Go more into the design and less into the contestants. I don't care if Tom's dad's cat's nephew has a brain tumor. I just want Lego",/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2020,danmunger15,2," Just another reality flop.
",I thought it would be a good show watching the creativity builds. It turned into just another reality show that provides fake drama and bickering with each other. Blah.,/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2020,jhuebel,5," Overacting by the ""contestants"", Overproduced, Joyless
","This only gets 5 stars because Lego. Otherwise, it's painful to watch. The ""contestants"" are over the top. The show is over-produced, meaning that it's a assault on the eyes. And overall, the show lacks the joy of making things with Lego.",/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2021,andrewdmizzou,7," Love that there is a lego show but it could be better
",Please less reality show drama and more killer builds. I don't care how long it takes them. I would much prefer see experts make insane 3 day builds that are worthy of legoland than see a rushed attempt at something. At the very least give them more time than you did. No one wants to see half assed builds because of some arbitrary time crunch.,/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2020,goldengirl-63967,10," Love watching with my kids!!
",We don't normally watch competition shows with our kids (ages 4 & 6) but it's Legos!!! The technical working that goes into these builds... the math and science skills they display.... are great lessons for kids and adults!!!!,/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2020,dixiedoggg,1," 2% LEGOS, 98% BS
",I actually like LEGOS and their many designs.,/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2020,coomie,5," More LEGO, less people please
","Absolutely love the idea for this show and the challenges are great. But there is just way tot much fabricated drama and time spent talking and focusing on drama. Show the freaking builds and techniques and creativity. They spend like 5 minutes per episode showing off and explaining the final builds, and there are like 10 builds.",/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv

18 December 2020,linusen-938-918639,5," Cut the guy who cuts
","I do not understand why Americans insist on tleeling the entire plot in the trailer. Envry single episodes.
And what's up with the extreme facial expressions? It's ridiculous!",/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2021,hagenees2001,3," So much potential, but...
","As always when it comes to US versions, it's filled with scripted nonsense and drama. For some reason, Arnett needs the limelight. Contestants, for whatever reason, share their life stories and are over the top dramatic, cheering and clapping for everything and crying over nothing. I would prefer to see more of the actual building process and less of the people. So much potential, but unfortunately it remains just that... potential.",/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2020,jstepp-72919,8," Love it
","I dont know..maybe not for everyone...but I like the creativity, and Will is a great host. I hope that it keeps going.",/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2020,MajBlade2,2," Sounded interesting and fun....it wasnt
","When I saw the promos for this I thought ""This might be fun to watch"" I like legos and like to see the neat things that can be built. I like Will Arnett sounds like a winner. It wasn't it was basically a reality show with stupid gags thrown in. The corny jokes and the over hype of the drama almost immediately turned me off to the whole thing went back to watch third episode and it seemed even worse. I kept wondering...where are the legos?
And it really isnt kid friendly so be aware.",/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2020,steven136,3," Failed remake of australian version
",This is unfortunately just a bad remake of the Australian version of Lego Masters. The challenges are all identical and everything appears so scripted. Has no contestant seen the Australian version? Why are they so shocked when everything is the same?,/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2020,jeffstiegler,2," Don't waste your time
",Legos are only a small part of the show. Rather it focuses one the idiotic comments by contestants and the host. So disappointed.,/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2021,koellis-32845,3," Missed opportunity
","Did the producers not watch the Australian and UK versions of this show. The money prize is obscene in this day and age, $100,000, wouldn't a Lego fan prefer a trip to Lego HQ in Denmark and visit the design studio. The first 5 minutes was spent listening to the contestants screaming and us viewing different face contortions. The background noises are so over powering. The newly married couple were so cheesy it made me feel sick. Sorry, not for me.",/review/rw6982541/?ref_=tt_urv
