6 November 2013,A_Different_Drummer,9," As much happening behind the lens as in front ....
","Yes, I know the critics at the time panned it. But if that was the baseline for greatness, films like Wonderful Life and Citizen Kane would be lost to obscurity. Bottom line, this is a ""high concept"" film that is much more entertaining than you would guess. The timeline is fascinating. In the 1960s, after a half-century run, and massive exposure on the new medium called Television, the classic western started to disappear. But, as they say, nature abhors a vacuum; and at the same time the sun started to set on the traditional western, it started to rise on something called the ""italian westerns"" or re-imaginings of the genre from Europe. This is for example how Clint Eastwood went from forgotten TV actor (Rawhide) to #1 box office attraction. This new genre lasted barely 15 years or so and soon disappeared as well. Yet out of nowhere, 20 years later someone in Tinseltown gets the idea to re-imagine the ALREADY RE-IMAGINED western, this time starring a female. Sharon Stone was past the apex of her career by this point, making the project more of a challenge. The other talent was awesome. A pre-Oscar Russell Crowe, a pre-Titanic diCaprio, and all backstopped by Hackman, I mean, wow. The big question, did it actually work? Answer yes. It was uneven in parts and an argument could be made that Hackman overdid the ""bad guy"" role or, alternatively, the part was over-written. Stone was awesome, proving she had the chops to take on a bizarre role and make it hers. Actually gets better with each successive viewing. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

","In the Western town of Redemption John Herrod runs everything, they say he gets half of every dollar spent or earned.  In order to face his enemies face on he runs an annual quick draw contest where fights battle each other until only one remains.

5 August 2004,Boba_Fett1138,8," Fun modern western.
",This movie uses lot's of ingredients used in classic westerns. It does it in a fun way but it doesn't spoof the classic westerns in any way and it never becomes humorous or a parody that makes fun of the genre.,/review/rw0369682/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2009,Samiam3,7," Raimi goes West
","With The Quick and the Dead, Sam Raimi approaches the old west with a very new/contemporary style. With its brisk energy and competitive characters, the story often feels like a sports movie with lots of photography tricks. If you want a top western, this might not be your film, but if what you seek you is good old pistol-whippin' American fun, this might do the trick.",/review/rw0369682/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2015,ma-cortes,6," Thrilling Western in Spaghetti style in which a mysterious stranger female arrives in a township where takes place a quick-draw competition
","Peculiar Western with spectacular gun battle between Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman . The title ""The Quick and the Dead"" comes from the King James translation of the Bible, I Peter 4:5, which admonishes the believer from behaving like pagans, ""who shall give account to Christ that is ready to judge the quick and the dead"" . This violent Western is set on a township called Redemption , the star is a mysterious female revenger , ¨a woman without name¨ (Sharon Stone as Clint Eastwood-alike interloper) who has a secret agenda of her own . It deals about a gunfighter arriving a little town , it has the usual shops and buildings, as General merchandise, Livery stable, boarding house , Hardware , Barber shop, Saloon , Hotel and Church . The western town owned by a ruthless gunslinger (Gene Hackman) hosting an elimination tournament to find the fastest gun in the West , as Lady avenger comes to the aid of embattled citizens as well as searching vendetta . The excitement starts at the duel when the hands point straight up .",/review/rw0369682/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2008,bkoganbing,8," A Fast Draw Superbowl
","Although The Quick and the Dead is primarily remembered among film fans starring Sharon Stone as a revenge seeking frontier woman, for me the film stands out because of Gene Hackman. As John Herod, outlaw kingpin and ruler of the outlaw town of Redemption, Hackman is one of the most evil people ever created in any film genre.",/review/rw0369682/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2012,classicsoncall,8," ""Maybe one day your luck will run out.""
","The Western is my favorite movie genre and I've seen hundreds of them. After a while it's difficult to find anything unique about them because it's usually the good guys versus the bad guys and when you get to the end justice is generally served. ""The Quick and The Dead"" combines elements of your typical Western themes, the evil town boss who rules with an iron will, gunslingers out to prove who's the fastest draw, and the no-name stranger who hits town seeking revenge for a past wrong. There's even a former outlaw who's turned to the Bible in an effort to seek redemption, adding some resonance to the name of the town where the story takes place.",/review/rw0369682/?ref_=tt_urv

8 June 2012,KineticSeoul,7," It's like a comic book western
","Now I enjoy western movies and although this doesn't have that traditional western vibe going for it, it's still pretty darn entertaining. This movie is like watching a comic book western movie come to life and although the plot is a bit absurd it's creative and has substance to it. Despite the it going in a narrow direction but it goes in a narrow direction with at least some substance. The plot is about a woman named Ellen aka Lady(Sharon Stone) who is a badass cowgirl that comes to a western town with a motive and ends up in a quick draw tournament with bunch of contestants. Anyone can challenge anyone in this tournament. The reward for winning the tournament is 120,000 dollars and the last man standing takes it all. What I liked about this movie besides it being a movie about a quick draw tournament in the west is how fun, intriguing and creative the action scenes are. A bit wacky at times but still pretty cool to watch, even the dialogue is a bit comic book like. Sharon Stone is charismatic and very attractive in this, especially with the cowgirl attire. Leo is pretty good as the Kid even if he can be a little annoying at times. Gene Hackman stands out as the villain without overdoing it and actually backs up what he says for the most part unless when he is unsure. So it isn't a shock why he owns the whole western town but this isn't the first western Gene has been in. Russell Crowe is in this and although he plays decent part in the story his character ain't nothing special and sort of comes off mundane but he was in good shape. Despite his mysterious past. Overall I enjoyed this movie, not one of the best western I seen but it's a pretty cool one.",/review/rw0369682/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2002,lwjoslin,," Splatter Western
","""The Quick and the Dead"" is a ""splatter Western,"" directed by horror vet Sam Raimi (whose latest, as of this writing, is ""Spider-Man,"" but who cut his teeth on the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy).  It's set in the oh-so-ironically named lawless town of Redemption, a haven of grotesques that gives us an idea what the wild West would've looked like if had been painted, not by Frederic Remington, but by Heironymus Bosch.

24 October 2019,droog-56936,10," An Underrated Western Classic
","If this movie doesn't get your pulse running from the very beginning then you are dead already. One of the best westerns of all time. Director Sam Raimi makes art out of every shot. Everything is thought out to perfection and the cast is almost unbelievably crammed with star power. Sharon Stone, Leonardo DiCaprio, Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe, Lance Henriksen and more great character actors than you can shake a cowboy hat at.

31 August 2018,josegonsalves-84577,," Needs to be rediscovered
","A great western by Sam Raimi starring some super power talent in Russell Crowe, Sharon Stone, Leo Di Caprio and Gene Hackman. The cinematography is really good and clearly a homage to The man with no man movies. Direction is crisp and Sam Raimi should be applauded for that. On the cinematography, the great Ebert wrote that it reeks of biblical vengeance. Just watch this for the setting.",/review/rw0369682/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2019,Mr-Fusion,7," Reputation aside, it grows on you
","Not a bad movie at all, but it does take a bit to really settle into. For a while, Sharon Stone is really trying to sell the macho gunslinger with baggage, but she's doing it with her Hollywood looks and pearly whites; she's missing grit. And that does improve later on, but like I said, patience is needed.",/review/rw0369682/?ref_=tt_urv

22 September 2018,AlexanderRohdeJ,8," Different western but in a good way
","This is not your typical western.
But that's not necessarily a bad thing.
I love the western genre and I want it to be taken seriously.
But if somebody should make a funny western Sam Raimi is the perfect director for it.
If you like his style and enjoy the evil dead films you will love this movie.
The crazy death scene in the end and the amazing zoom in shots that create great intensity are all brilliant.
I highly recommend this movie to all Sam Raimi fans.
It's made in a super interesting funny amazing awesome way.
With a great cast and awesome effects and scenes.
Such a cool western from the 90's.
Seriously check this movie out!",/review/rw0369682/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2016,Leofwine_draca,7," Scattershot western spoof with lots of energy and a great supporting cast
","Sam Raimi does it again with this affectionate and entertaining take on the western genre. It's a light-hearted and simple film, comfortable to whizz along with a witty script delivered by an ensemble cast, and while you won't see anything new here, the wild west staples are delivered with relish and gusto. Made soon after ARMY OF DARKNESS, this is very much in the EVIL DEAD style, with all manner of camera tricks and transformations to mark it out as something standing separate from the rest.",/review/rw0369682/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2003,perfectbond,8," An entertaining western
","The first thing to say about this film is that the cast is an all-star one: Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Gary Sinise in a bit part. Each of the characters, even Hackman's villain Herod, is so likeable and charismatic that you can't help but feeling sad that a good portion of them will be killed. There is some spectacular cinematography and creatively conceived shots from director Sam Raimi and his team. A particularly memorable shot is the one of the sunlight shining through the bullet hole of the victim's head. In my opinion the two drawbacks of The Quick and the Dead are the thin plot and the relative scarcity of dialogue. With a cast like this it's a bit of a shame that it is underutilized. Still this film provides a solid hour and a half or so of entertainment, 7.5/10.",/review/rw0369682/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2000,greenman_99,10," Exaggerated, intense, beautiful, silly
","Like all of Sam Raimi's movies, this flick was a cartoon. That's not an insult- his works with the Coen brothers on movies like The Hudsucker Proxy are some of my favorites, with their insanely ""zoomed-in"" quality. This movie was a spaghetti western, it was ABOUT spaghetti westerns, and it was also a weird, wonderful nightmare where your options are limited, you're a superhero, and your enemy is all-powerful. That's adolescent, silly, and totally compelling.",/review/rw0369682/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2007,moonspinner55,5," Intentionally over-the-top, but flimsy instead of full-bodied...
","Flashy but flimsy western tries for fantasy-mythic feel but never quite achieves its ambitions. Sharon Stone plays mysterious lady gunslinger who signs up for dueling contest in a tumbleweed town once she discovers her mortal nemesis is involved, the mangy varmint who was instrumental in killing her sheriff father. Spirited, but shallow, artistically-wayward western with tongue-in-cheek. It has some silly flash and sass, but it isn't involving, nor do any of the players (a jaw-dropper of a cast which includes Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Gary Sinise) come off looking especially good. Director Sam Raimi sets up some visually amazing shots--but without honest, gritty characters, it's not much more than a live-action cartoon. Stone is flippant and sexy, but she's just relying on her proved shtick and it quickly wears thin. ** from ****",/review/rw0369682/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2001,refinedsugar,7," ... and they said westerns were dead.
","Take a typical western motif and mix it with a huge cast of recognizable faces and you have this genre throwback. Including Sharon Stone doing her take on 'the lady with no name'. With a dark past, she comes into a town gone straight to hell that's run by a nasty outlaw played by Hackman who usurps his power over the townsfolk that equally hate and fear him. It's here where these characters meet for the town's last man standing duel. Where the prize is to die for and of course many will before it's all over. ",/review/rw0369682/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 1999,helpless_dancer,2," hammy, overacted, silly piece of garbage
","I can recommend this film highly to everyone!! If you are having trouble sleeping, that is. How this junk got out to the public I can't fathom. It offered nothing in the way of drama; it did offer, however, some of the silliest 'comedy' which was not intended to be comedy. At least I don't think it was meant to be so. I expected a realistic movie about gunfighters; and got a bunch of overgrown boys playing at being Billy Badass. And Sharon Stone! Gad, this woman needs a new profession. Miscast maybe, or perhaps no actress could do much with such a stupid, overdone role. Gene Hackman, usually one of my favorite players, was simply boring and unbelievable. But again, he didn't have much to work with. This was an idiotic film, I give it 3 thumbs down.",/review/rw0369682/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2002,tfrizzell,," Good Performances and Smart Direction Raise Mediocre Screenplay.
","The evil Gene Hackman runs his old west town with an iron-fist ala his role in ""Unforgiven"". Several want to dethrone him though at his annual gun-fighting showdown. There is the young and wild Leonardo DiCaprio who has been reared by Hackman, but knows Hackman's reign of terror must be stopped. Former gunfighter and current preacher Russell Crowe is also pushed to fight in the contest. There is the highly dark Lance Henriksen and hired gun Keith David who are also present. But it might be mysterious drifter Sharon Stone who can defeat Hackman and get her revenge. A really silly story works due to top-notch performances from the key players. Sam Raimi's crazed direction makes the whole project work about as well as it could have. Russell Crowe, then relatively unknown, shines most among the talented cast. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",/review/rw0369682/?ref_=tt_urv
