10 July 2022,daisukereds,8," ""I'm afraid anything I say will upset you""
","There's nothing like a good story at sea! And this is the kind of movie you hope is as good as it looks. And to me, it delivered.",/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2022,briancham1994,7," Good visuals, good banter, somewhat predictable storyline
","Firstly, the visuals. Everything is visually gorgeous and well designed, from Bridgetown (think Victorian Venice) to the ships to the ocean. A lot of care was taken in the actual animation (i.e. Movement) of all of these elements. The waves and spray of the ocean look like they're from a documentary, the swaying of the ship looks truly forceful and the destruction of the town is full of debris and dust. Not to mention a clever little scene involving a rope and a coconut tree. This gives the entire film an immersive feeling and really raises the stakes as we can truly appreciate how powerful the forces of nature are.",/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2022,supermellowcali,8," Excellent
","This is a fantastic movie for all ages. While oversimplified, this kind of story can only be so complex to work as what it is. I thought the animation was especially well done, because capturing the physics of the ocean, ships and objects together is super tricky. The girl's voice didn't really work for me (too young maybe) and some of the dialog could've been better,, but overall this is very entertaining moment to moment. Nice job!",/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2022,maykalrif,8," watch it.
","If it was a Disney movie, everyone would be talking about this movie, but unfortunately, not a lot of people saw this movie. For me, I saw the trailer by chance on YouTube, so I was interested. It is a very fun movie with amazing animation and a great story.",/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2022,IonicBreezeMachine,9," Christ Williams directs his greatest film yet that builds upon the strengths of his Moana and refines the weaknesses.
","Set in a world of fantastic Sea Beasts, orphan Maisie Brumble (Zaris-Angel Hator) grows up admiring the heroic exploits of monster hunters in various books with no ship of monster hunters more revered than Captain Augustus Crow (Jared Harris) of the ship The Inevitable who is respected by his crew especially Jacob Holland whom Crow rescued as a boy and views as an adopted son. Following the Inevitable's successful hunt of a sea beast, the King (Jim Carter) and Queen (Doon Mackichan) of the empire they serve are displeased with Crow for having abandoned pursuit of sea beast, The Red Bluster, in order to rescue fellow monster hunters from another sea beast. Declaring the age of hunters over and assigning Admiral Hornagold (Dan Stevens) the task of bringing down Red Bluster with the royal frigate The Imperator, Crow and his crew soon setout in a race to bring down Red Bluster to prove the age of hunters is still alive. Maisie stows away having lost her monster hunter parents on board the ship The Monarch, and Crow allows her to stay despite Jacob's objections but eventually Maisie and Jacob discover the true nature of the sea beasts isn't aligned with what they've been told.",/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2022,HlenSki,9," Beautiful
","Stunningly beautiful and colourful. Attention to detail in graphics is amazing. A story about befriending assumed enemies and leaving behind a generations long cycle of vengeance in exchange for peace. Effortless story telling. Funny, but in a warm fuzzy way, not over the top.",/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2022,oscarflash,8," The Red Beast

","As others put it: the plot is standard, sure.",/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2022,Spiritus33,9," A new step for graphics
","Unlike some people here, that clearly need to upgrade or properly setup their tv, say, this is another step up for graphics. You can take it from someone that has seen and loved animated movies for a long time, this is amazing.",/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,mrashtastic89,7," Beastily overrated
","Daily reminder that overrated doesn't mean bad and that I actually quite enjoyed this film but it's far from a top 10 of the year, even though that's not exactly saying much.",/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2022,icocleric,9," Heart Warming, Pirates, and Awesome Creatures!
","It has very much a How To Train Your Dragon feeling, but it's very good in its own right. The creature designs are just adorable. The animation itself has some really stunning moments, it's very good.",/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2022,peterbreis,7," Repackaged Moby Dick for the non-reader generation
",A visually tasty mash-up of Moby Dick and the Dragon movies. Down to the sea beasts having the same faces as the dragons.,/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2022,messer-49320,5," Started off really strong
",Visuals and acting are a 9/10 probably - what absolutely destroyed this movie was the reveal and conclusion.,/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv

9 July 2022,enadyo,6," Great graphics, too predictable
",What's the use of great graphics if the storyline is so predictable?,/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2022,hannahwilliams-mail,10," Wow!
","This is so cute! Amazing animation, great voice acting, good premise and just all around gorgeous! I loved this movie so much! I loved how sweet and adventurous Maisie was! Kudos to the voice actor they did an amazing job portraying Maisie's character! Red was perfectly cute and scary. The water scenes in the beginning with the sea monsters was actually quite frightening. Maybe it's just because I'm afraid of getting lost at sea or in space and being swallowed whole by a ginormous beast. I was watching the movie and I was like is that Karl Urban? And it is!!",/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2022,felixstaffanson,4," Could have been better
","It started out great, but after a short bit it became quite predictable. A little girl who has never been on the sea and who has dreamt all of her life too become a hunter just knows that the sea beasts are the good guys and knows everything that's going on with them. In my opinion it became quite cliche.",/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2022,allan-14931,5," Good story marred by finale nonnsense
","A story where the real beast were the humans all along is a classic, unfortunately this is marred by lack of any reason for much of what happens or how the war started. What would the monarchy gain by a war that made trade more dangerious, and why would intelligent beasts attack civilian ships not hunting them. And why did one of the beasts on the island attack our protagonists. The whole thing falls apart with Disney Black and White nonsense.",/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2022,CinemaClown,," Pirates Of The Caribbean Meets How To Train Your Dragon
","Pirates of the Caribbean meets How To Train Your Dragon in this simple, sweet & sumptuously animated sea voyage that's crafted with sincerity & rendered with finesse. The Sea Beast is a fascinating story about fantastic beasts & sailors who venture to find them and makes for one surprisingly delightful adventure-fantasy that packs no shortage of heart, heroics & humanity.",/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2022,abelpraiz,9," Bland Title with Top notch Visuals and Action.
",This is more like an action movie than a Pixar emotional movie it simple and straight forward do not expect a Disney or Pixar kind of writing because it's Netflix it straight forward story telling with good visuals. A perfect weekend watch for adults and kids who loves animated movies.,/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2022,darkness_313,3," Flip a coin
","If you haven't seen either this movie or ""how to train your dragon"", the movie you see first will greatly reduce the other, But i'd recommend ""how to train your dragon"", you get 3 movies from that.",/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv

10 July 2022,tandeki,5," How to win a diversity prize
","This movie tries so hard to be diverse and to transport the message of a world where we are all like the colors of the rainbow, it simply forgot to tell a proper story.",/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,IWasKnownAsThe1SentenceReviewer,3," Writing from an adult human (which I am) point-of-view
","Writing from an adult human (which I am) point-of-view, I would want to point out the broad ethnic diversity of the cast... and that is all for the pluses: lower than average animation-style, the physicality of the beasts (parting water on the surface like it's just a tiny toy), the movements in and on the water (DiCaprio would be jealous of Young Jacob on his makeshift raft) just did not feel right from the beginning (...and the story... aaaaaaaaah...).",/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2022,maximovlE,2," Can we go now?
","I believe the word is forced. The whole movie felt forced. Unrealistic in any sense of the word and forced. The animation, the sound, the acting, and definitely the story... All needed more work.",/review/rw8382448/?ref_=tt_urv
