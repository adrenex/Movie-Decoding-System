17 October 2016,tomgillespie2002,6," Hints at a more interesting film than is delivered
","With one of the most recognisable faces in the world, Daniel Radcliffe seems to be making a full-throttle effort not to go down the same road taken by many child actors, and has tried to cast as wide a net as possible when it comes to film roles. Whether it be a man sprouting horns in, erm, Horns (2013), a hunchbacked assistant in Victor Frankenstein (2015) or a farting corpse in this year's Swiss Army Man, his desire to shake shake off the ghost of Harry Potter is nothing but admirable. With Imperium, there's no extravagant make-up or gimmick to hide behind, or in fact any hair, as he convinces as a bookish FBI agent turned white supremacist infiltrator.",/review/rw7544948/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2018,TheLittleSongbird,6," The defending of a nation
","'Imperium's' main interest point is the subject matter, it's an important and relevant one, very hard-hitting and portraying it takes a lot of courage with the danger of heavy-handedness or bias. Toni Collette is a fine actress, have liked to loved a lot of her performances, and wanted to see how Daniel Radcliffe would fare in one of his most mature and most challenging roles.",/review/rw7544948/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2017,SnoopyStyle,7," Radcliffe surprising
",Nate Foster (Daniel Radcliffe) is an empathetic nerdy FBI agent. Agent Angela Zamparo (Toni Collette) recruits him to infiltrate white supremacists suspected of importing stolen caesium. The prime target is internet radio host Dallas Wolf. Nate tries to connect through local leader Vince Sargent. He also connects with Aryan militia leader Andrew Blackwell and seemingly suburban family man Gerry Conway.,/review/rw7544948/?ref_=tt_urv

6 May 2017,kosmasp,9," What you don't expect
","Or maybe you do expect it. I guess in a way, maybe you do, because I did too. But it's still nicely told with a pace that may not suit everyone, because it's not fast paced and tries to stay as grounded to reality as possible. While characters in the film are not described as people in the real life, I'm pretty sure you'll guess one or two inspirations from ""news"" programs.",/review/rw7544948/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2016,Brendan3,3," Great idea for a movie, but poorly written, directed, and acted
","If you want to see a film about a conflicted FBI agent infiltrating a modern day white supremacist revolutionary group, seek out the far superior 1988 Costa-Gavras film ""Betrayed""",/review/rw7544948/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2016,fxdx4,8," Imperium is a powerful drama that will interest those who follow domestic terrorism.
","Radcliffe at first might seem like a poor choice to be cast as a skin head/Nazi, but in fact his characteristics make perfect sense in the film. Radcliffe is a young FBI agent that is chosen to infiltrate a local white power movement to prevent a credible domestic terror threat a la the Oklahoma City bombing from the 90s. This is not an action film with brawls and fire fights; this is a drama that tries to honestly show those involved in the white power movement. Overall this film is engaging and engrossing on its own, but also challenges itself by giving these social villains some screen time.",/review/rw7544948/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2017,gradyharp,8," 'For evil to triumph, it only takes good men... to do nothing.'
","Even the title of this film is terrifying: IMPERIUM - 'English-speaking Neo-Nazi frequently refer to a ""Western Imperium"" as a theoretical future global empire following their political and philosophical views.' Unfortunately the theme of this film is based on true incidents as written by Michael German with Daniel Ragussis who also directs. It is a magnifying glass held up to the many organizations of racists who believe that all non- Caucasian people should be destroyed - the white supremacists, be they KKK, or any other of the many hate groups whose influence is being more intensely felt during these times. It is a difficult movie to watch but at the same time perhaps it is a film that more people should see to be aware of a threat to equality that abounds, especially since January 2017!",/review/rw7544948/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2016,Reno-Rangan,7," The good, the Bad and the Ugly sides of the FBI force!
","The post Harry Potter series, apart from awesome in 'Horns', Daniel Radcliffe struggled to find his character, where he fits in. I mean he tried many different ones, but I think in this he was so good. Initially I thought 'whaaaat?' Because with his physique, he did not qualify to play an FBI agent. He was like when the Captain America first came to the army recruitment. And then when the story progressed, I realised the character was designed that way. So I found it kind of fun, though the topic it was dealing, especially knowing it was inspired by the real, this is definitely an eye opener.",/review/rw7544948/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2017,TheOneThatYouWanted,10," Based on true events.
","I remember when the trailer for this movie first hit YouTube. Nazi-trolls invaded the comment section hard, and now I can see why. This film is based on true events. The stupid marketing SHOULD have put that right in the trailer, ""Based on real life events."" Whatever, I'm not here to review the trailer, I'm here to review the film and I'm happy to report it is good. And educational. First off, the acting is great across the board. Daniel Radcliffe will never be Harry Potter or ""that kid who played Harry Potter"" or ""that actor who played Harry Potter."" In my mind's eye he has officially become just Daniel Radcliffe, if you watch this film you'll see why. Heck, the man can even do an American accent without sounding like he has a gear jammed down his throat. Tell that to Dr. Strange, Rick from Walking Dead and House MD. Anyway, Daniel Radcliffe did the impossible and escaped the kiddy typecast role curse; something Frodo from LoTRs has yet to do, but I digress. ",/review/rw7544948/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2016,thechoctopfilmblog,6," Radcliffe's tenacity pays off
","Daniel Radcliffe as a FBI agent and an extreme white supremacist, now that was a film I really had to see. Personally, I love undercover stories as they have inbuilt elements of excitement and uncertainty. You're wondering constantly whether the covert operation is going to be a success or a failure.

26 December 2021,gianmarcoronconi,9," Good
","Very pretentious film that manages to mount expectations very well and fulfill them very well. In general, the film is very entertaining and always manages to keep the tension level high so that it never gets boring.",/review/rw7544948/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2020,dommercaldi,5," Really Good Performances And Very Tense, But The Writing Lets It Down Massively
","Pros:
1. The score brilliantly lathers the film in a constantly tense and nerve-wracking feel.
2. The movie provides a fair enough representation of white power views which serves to heighten Nate Foster's (Daniel Radcliffe) ideological struggles and make them feel more real.
3. Daniel Radcliffe, Toni Collette (Angela Zamparo), Chris Sullivan (Andrew Blackwell), and Seth Numrich (Roy) give brilliant performances.
4. The tension and suspense are built up really well and it keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat for the entire duration.",/review/rw7544948/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2016,redrobin62-321-207311,8," Didn't Go Where I Thought It Would
","It's sometimes difficult to rate clich√©-filled movies like these after seeing similar ones, like American History X, Drummer, A Time to Kill, 12 Years A Slave, and many others. The problem is, well, you've seen and heard it all before - the virulent language, the willful ignorance of the perpetrators, their misguided ideology and, of course, their insistence on victimhood. Imperium is no different, but it sure is timely as hell, went to far as to even mention Dylann Roof who has NOW only been found mentally able to stand trial for his dirty deed done dirt cheap.",/review/rw7544948/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2016,ericnottelling,3," was this written by a 3rd grader
","This movie was awful. The story was so bad it's comical. Radcliffe stumbles through every hard point in the whole movie, while he is magically loved by everyone for no reason. This movie is a wanna be point break with a really poor story line.",/review/rw7544948/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2016,FlashCallahan,5," Radcliffe is just too nice to fit the role...

",Decent movie. interesting but slow. good acting. i don't really have any issues with it. it was just kinda slow and felt like a straight to dvd movie at times. i watched a lot of it at 1.2 speed. but i was invested in the story and the premise was interesting (1 viewing),/review/rw7544948/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2017,gustheaffen,1," Fantasy Land
","Very slow and laughably silly story. The uber liberal take on all Trump supporters are white supremacists, Jew haters etc. marching around screaming racist things and the anti-fa that are the ones wearing the mask, bullying and intimidating people with force during peaceful protests are not a problem. Disgusting and predictable tripe. Not to mention the story is just plain dumb. When they make the arrest he blows his cover right away. The acting is absurd, including Toni Collette's extremely annoying gum chewing and stupid facial expressions. The only victims are the idiots that watch and believe this pile of trash. It is so poorly written because it is complete fantasy land propaganda that fails miserably.",/review/rw7544948/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2018,Pairic,8," Good Conspiracy Thriller
","Imperium: Daniel Radcliffe is an FBI analyst with no field experience who is persuaded by senior agent Toni Collette to infiltrate the White Separatist movement after barrels of caesium go missing. Starting with skinheads he delves further and deeper into the white Power circles seeing their disagreements over dogma, how they flock around a low rent Alex Jones type. The disparate groups unite for a march and during a confrontation at this demo, Radcliffe rescues the leader of the Aryan alliance from attackers getting an in to the apparently more serious groups.",/review/rw7544948/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2016,m_bong1,10," Retrospection of peoples supremacists hackles raised
","This is mainly a rebuttal of all those people whose automatic hackles got raised for no reason other than this portrayed a reality that they do not want to admit to. I would suggest that they do some research behind the person who actually wrote the script to this movie (Michael German), who has a first hand account of the actual events as it unfolded. Several of the comments that took offense to the movie should go back and try to see the background behind this to assess its veracity.",/review/rw7544948/?ref_=tt_urv

19 August 2016,zerocrew-56802,2," An embarrassment for everybody
","This one's gonna leave a brown stain on Radcliff's resume. It's so bad, it's embarrassing to watch at times. Earlier, ericnottelling says that ""was this written by a 3rd grader"" - It's actually even worst. A 3rd grader could debunk this movie. The plot is so ludicrous, that it makes Harry Potter feel like a believable piece of reported documentary. Like Eric said, everybody loves that young scrawny punk for no reason - have a chamomile tea (lmfao) with the nazi leader, and suddenly the dude is going to tell you his secret master world domination cunning plan and includes you in the A-team because you got a liking in classical music. Radcliff really struggles with his role, and I can't totally blame him, the script is a disaster. In opposition of movies like American History X, that put Radcliff in the junior league compared to Ed Norton, the Bieber one. Although, I can understand at some extend Justin Bieb having fans,but I could not fathom if somebody comes with something positive about this pathetic flick... Don't waste your time or money with this - even free, this is still a waste of electricity and time you never could get back. Cringe level 10. Hogwarts Wizard ain't no KKK Imperial Wizard.",/review/rw7544948/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2016,zardoz-13,7," Harry Potter Joins the FBI
","Former ""Harry Potter"" star Daniel Radcliffe defies typecasting as a young wizard with his gripping portrayal of an undercover FBI agent in freshman writer & director Daniel Ragussis' ""Imperium,"" based on the exploits of retired Special Agent Mike German who collaborated on the screenplay with Ragussis. For the record, German's days as an undercover agent occurred during the 1990s. Ivy-League, wet-behind-the-ears, bespectacled, FBI agent Nate Foster is participating in the eternal war against terrorism when he learns that there are more than enough homegrown terrorists infest the domestic borders of America to keep the Bureau sweating. A mild-mannered, immaculately attired FBI agent with far more sophistication than some of his colleagues, Foster catches the shrewd eye of Nicorette gum-chewing FBI agent Angela Zamparo (Toni Collette of ""The Sixth Sense"") who recruits him to infiltrate white supremacist groups. Nate's FBI superior Tom Hernandez (Nestor Carbonell of ""The Dark Knight"") warns Nate that undercover work is a one-way ticket to oblivion. Nevertheless, our hero changes his name from Nate Foster to Nate Thomas and then sets out to infiltrate homeland terrorists. Despite his woeful lack of knowledge about undercover work, Zamparo gives Nate what she considers the best primer for working undercover: Dale Carnegie's bestseller ""How Win Friends and Influence People."" Nate gives himself a buzz-cut to acquire the appropriate look before he plunges into deep waters of white supremacy. Initially, he insinuates himself into the lower echelons of white supremacists: the Aryan warriors. Later, he meets one of the white supremacists, a suburban husband and father Gerry Conway (Sam Trammel of HBO's ""True Blood""), isn't the typical skin head covered in tattoos. Conway appreciates the finer things in life, like classical music, and he grows to trust Nate. Meantime, Nate must contend with some of the more violent examples who storm around with their heads shaved and wear uniforms adorned with swastikas. After the rougher variety of supremacists grow wary of him, Nate aligns himself with Conway, and they barely have enough time to thwart Conway and his people.",/review/rw7544948/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2016,cosmo_tiger,8," This is a very good and powerful movie that should be watched and thought about. Really has the feel of American History X
","""We all create a narrative based on what we think is important. We see what we want to see, but just because you're not looking at something doesn't mean it's not there."" After a terrorist threat is thwarted the city is on high alert. The FBI looks at the standard suspect list but Angela Zamparo (Collette) thinks it is a different group behind this one. Rookie agent Nate Foster (Radcliffe) is recruited to go undercover as a white supremacist in order to discover and stop the plot. This is a very good movie with shades of American History X. Radcliffe turns in maybe the best performance of his career and you can really feel his tenseness and the conflict he is under during this mission. The movie also really makes you think about what they are doing and wonder why more of a focus isn't given to this outside of movies. This is a very good and powerful movie that should be watched and thought about. Overall, a movie I highly recommend and one that has the feel of American History X, but isn't quite as good as that one. I give this an A-.",/review/rw7544948/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2021,searchanddestroy-1,5," Watch Betrayed instead
","I expected a bit more from this movie which the topic is close to Costa Gavras' BETRAYED, starring Debra Winger as an undercover female cop, in charge of investigating KKK supremacists, lead by a terrific Tom Berenger. In IMPERIUM, Daniel Radcliffe is the undercover FBI agent. It is not an uninteresting story, well documented, but Daniel Radcliffe is rather blank, and the story pretty predictable. Good scenes but, I repeat, I waited for something else, darker atmosphere.",/review/rw7544948/?ref_=tt_urv
