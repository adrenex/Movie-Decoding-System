13 June 2002,johnnyboyz,7," Great Film
","Van Damme is at his best here, it's a good film that moves at a steady pace and is almost like a  Rocky/Street Fighter type film. The characters are played well and the right actors and actresses are picked for the right roles. Van Damme's trainer is great and the silent Van Damme is defiantly the best. The plot also unwinds at the right times and at the right pace. You should give this film a go.",/review/rw0284929/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2003,Movie Nuttball,10," Great Van Damme movie!Arguably one of his best!
","Lionheart is one of Jean-Claude Van Damme's best films! Van Damme was good, classic 80s series Sledge Hammer star Harrison Page was very good.The Qissi brothers were very good and loved Abdel's character Attila!He is such a great one as I like many things about him!Brian Thompson was good as always Voyo Goric was here and look for Tony Halme AKA Ludvig Borga near the end in the big fight!The movie is never boring and boasts lots of action and great music by John Scott!If you like Van Damme and fighting films then check out Lionheart!",/review/rw0284929/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2002,DunnDeeDaGreat,," One of Van Damme's best
",Lionheart is clealry one of the best movies Van Damme made in his early days. The film had good fight scenes and a nice plot. Harrison Page as Van Damme's boy provides a lot of good one-liners and Van Damme kicks a lot of ass. I give it *** out of ****.,/review/rw0284929/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2004,lotus_chief,7," One of Van Damme's better, more human films.....
","This is one of the few films by Van Damme that stand out in my mind when I think of his 'career highlights'. All of his films are formulaic actioners, but Lionheart is one of his better films. His character is more layered here, which makes this more of a drama than most of his others. We as the audience can feel for his character and, as a result, root for him as he tries to evade his past and help what family he has left. A nice little action film, with Van Damme forced to act a little here. For his capabilities, he is convincing as Lyon. Harrison Page is very good in the film as the ex-street fighter turned confidant, and almost steals the show. A highlight of Van Damme's career.",/review/rw0284929/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2003,uds3,," Up there in Van Dammage's top five flicks!
","Before we head off down critical trail, lets be charitable. This is a Van Damme flick - more or less its own genre, certainly sufficiently signposted for the unwary to avoid if this is not their comfort zone. Now I have to admit to a certain bias - we have almost every film Van Damme has ever made, and for the most part, on simply an entertainment scale, Jean Claude delivers the goods. (Even as late as REPLICANT)",/review/rw0284929/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2007,dee.reid,8," ""Lionheart"" - Welcome to the Lion's Den
","In the Jean-Claude Van Damme martial arts movie ""Lionheart,"" audiences get to see a side of the Muscles from Brussels not seen in previous action films like ""Bloodsport"" (1988) and ""Kickboxer"" (1989): Van Damme acting and fighting like there's no tomorrow. I must be crazy for giving ""Lionheart"" such a high rating based on ""acting"" from Van Damme but if one can get past the phony Hollywood theatrics and the like, you can see what is very easily the best of Van Damme's early work simply because he isn't trying too hard... yet.",/review/rw0284929/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2020,ma-cortes,7," Attractive Jean Claude Van Damme film with a sentimental and heartful plot , along with violent and bloody fights
","Nice movie considered to be probably Van Damme's best of his first and best period from his film debut No retreat , no surrender . Here Van Damme is a French Legionnaire who deserts from foreign Legion in Africa to come to America where his drug-dealing brother has been torched by competitors . Soon after, he hits the streets and realising that his struggle skills are the only way to help his brother's wife : Lisa Pelikan and little girl daughter , as he relunctantly ties in with hustler Harrison Page to compete in violent combats promoted by an egoistic woman : Deborah Rennard who changes the tables when he fails to succumb to her advances . As many fights ensue until an exciting , touching and thrilling finale. Honor or revenge, he has no choice...When the streets are jungle...they can only be one King. Too tough to die.",/review/rw0284929/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2014,slightlymad22,7," One Of Van Damme's Best Movies
","I know this movie as ""A.W.O.L Absent Without Leave"" but I have also seen it called Wrong Bet and Lionheart. This was one of the first movies I saw in 1990 knowing who Jean Claude Van Damme was, after previously seeing ""Blood Sport"" and ""Kickboxer"". Along with those two this helped set him on the road to stardom. Watching it today, I still think it is one of his best performances and best movies in general. Sure it's cheaply made and some of the acting is a bit dodgy but it's a lot of fun.",/review/rw0284929/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2008,hitchcockthelegend,7," JCVD doing what he does best.
","I often find myself bemused by some real harsh reviews of the better Van Damme films since they always deliver what is expected. Why for instance would someone who has seen Kickboxer, Bloodsport or Timecop go into a viewing of Lionheart and expect it to be the Citizen Kane of kung fooery ?. Jean Claude Van Damme movies pretty much do what they say on the tin, along with Seagal, Norris, Sly and the big Austrian Oak, there is a market they have cornered, and although I wouldn't be so foolish as to say that all their respective output is viable quality entertainment, i do say however that in amongst the collective output are films that shine quite brightly, and sadly many viewers seem intent on ignoring the quality pop corners and collectively call the output garbage.",/review/rw0284929/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2008,axlrhodes,7," A no brain fight film with a heart. Van Dammes best.
","When i saw this film i was just 15 and it touched me how Leon wanted to fight for his brothers wife and kid.The films fight scenes are well staged and when i watched the film again recently i was surprised by how much i enjoyed it.Thats the thing,its a really enjoyable film,you can harp on all day about how Van Damme isn't the worlds best actor,how the sound mix is wobbly and the film looks as though it has been churned out for TV but its a good story well executed and that is the long and short of it.Van Damme has gone on to make many a film in a similar vein but i felt it was on this production that he came off best.The trainer played by Harrison Page helps lift the film too. 8/10",/review/rw0284929/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2007,fullenw,10," Van Dammes best movie, hands down.
",One thing about this movie is the plot. Basically Lionheart is fighting to raise money for his dead brothers wife and kid. There's not much to the plot but its rare.,/review/rw0284929/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2015,adamscastlevania2,7," One of the mighty Belgians best
","(62%) Without doubt one of my favourite early(ish) Van Damme movies that is so much more like Street fighter the video game than the actual Street fighter film. This is nuts and bolts late 80's early 90's action B-movie fun right from the very beginning. Van Damme is on physical top form with some impressive moves from the many fights featured, the story is good simple action movie stuff, and even though this is clearly a lowish budgeted film it's always watchable and entertaining. Performance wise this isn't anything of course worth speaking of, but Harrison Page is good fun as the sleazy manager, while Deborah Rennard gets plenty of screen time wearing some of the periods' more curious fashions. Overall any true of Mr Damme should certainly check this out.",/review/rw0284929/?ref_=tt_urv

16 October 2015,Leofwine_draca,9," Crowd-pleasing early Van Damme effort
","A simplistic but effective early film from Van Damme, his fourth starring role after BLOODSPORT, CYBORG, and KICKBOXER. While some of the scenes and music appear to have been ripped off from ROCKY, this is still engaging viewing, with interesting acting and some great fight scenes to break up the rather soppy melodrama of the plot.",/review/rw0284929/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2015,Prismark10,4," Coeur de Lion
",AWOL also known as Lionheart shows us Van Damme just on the cusp of hitting stardom. By this time he had a loyal following for what were low budget martial arts films that got a loyal following on VHS and did well in the fledgling satellite movie channels market.,/review/rw0284929/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2015,ivo-cobra8,9," The best of Van Damme, a cult classic underdog martial arts film ever made!
","Lionheart (1990) was a real street fighter movie, It was also one of my favorite best Van Damme childhood movies. Beside Hard Target, Kickboxer, Universal Soldier, Bloodsport, Death Warrant, and Double Impact. This is in my opinion the best Van Damme movie since Bloodsport. I Love this movie to death, the movie, is sorta a spin off of Rocky, but it is completely different from that. This film has a heart, it is an underdog action drama about a men, who goes in to the gladiator fights and uses his martial arts to raise money, for his brother's family.

5 August 2000,action-6,," Great martial-art movie
","Lionheart is yet another Van Damme-movie with a lame story and great fight-scenes.  Van Damme escapes from the French foreign-legion to find the people who killed his brother.  When he comes to America he starts fighting for money, which he gives to his family.  As said before, the story isn`t that good, but it is head and shoulders above the terrible ""Black Eagle"". Lionheart is a great B-movie that is worth renting. 8/10",/review/rw0284929/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2018,nagrain,10," Stole My Heart
","I grew up as a fan of JCVD but watching this over again now in my late 30's I've got to say this is truly a good movie with good musical scores to accompany the emotions. It's not easy to understand the efforts in fighting to keep a family above grounds especially if you haven't a family of your own to provide for. Lionheart helps us to remember that there is still beauty in life worth fighting for even when life isn't fair and fills up with such ugliness. It's what we make of it, either we hide away in the dark or run into the light even if it means going AWOL. This is truly a movie I would keep close to heart, to fight when that's all you can do to keep all that you have left.",/review/rw0284929/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2016,videorama-759-859391,6," Wrongly betted film for some JCVD fans
","Let's call this, Wrong Bet, it sounds better. I've just watched this film again, after twenty years, and it ain't half a bad film, with some good performances, that of Lisa Pelikan, and Harrison Page. Wrong Bet's start, does seem familiar to a couple of other Van Damne flick early scenarios, as he again escapes the ugly foreign legion, and retreats to Los Angeles, amid some pit stops, as hearing his brother (involved in drug activities) is badly burnt. To help the widow and little Shirley Temple looking daughter, largely behind in rent, he partakes in underground fights, to earn some moolah. W.B has a pretty grounded story and straight forward plot and situations, where it veers more towards a drama, than the usual heavy action pics from our hunky lead. There is a quite a bit of action, but of course, it's mostly on the fighting ground, where the final fight, long and grueling, really has your attention, one of the best of it's time, where the opponent is a real beefcake of a fighter, those ones you really can't take as a human in these wrestler/kickboxer pics. This isn't a badly made film, where I was appreciative of those two performances, (Pelikan as the down on her luck widow) and Page as the limping ex fighter who partners up with Van Damne (dejavu of some other films of his, right?). But of course, the other standout is that of The Lady, the devious hot female fatale, running the underground fights, with her assistant (Cobra's Thompson- more human here). She takes VD under her wing, literally. This might not be the best one, for JCVD fans, who want to crave real action, amid explosions, and gunfire. But this movie does have heart, and quite a beautiful ending, but again, falls to average. Frequent graphic violence warning is an absolute joke.",/review/rw0284929/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2019,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,10," There can only be one king - My personal favorite Van Damme action movie of all time
","A powerful beautiful movie who deals with the real street fighting in a modern day of a gladiator fights for the money and the amusement of the rich. My second favorite Van Damme movie of all timre! Lionheart is one of the best martial arts films from Van Damme, which it is mixed with martial arts, action and drama. It is a beautiful movie, Jean-Claude Van Damme's best acting performance I have seen. His character has a good heart, like he gives money to the poor people. It is my eight personal favorite Jean-Claude Van Damme movie. Another childhood movie I grew up watching it as a kid.",/review/rw0284929/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2019,BandSAboutMovies,6," Fist fighting coast to coast
","Lionheart follows the basic plot of all Van Damme films. Our hero loses a family member in some horrible way, he must go AWOL or leave behind some responsibility and then must fight - even though he doesn't want to - before a big battle that redeems everything. My wife - having suffered through the makings of JCVD week where I've watched double-digit Van Damme films over several weeks of prep - remarked, ""These are all the same movie. Everyone wants him to fight. He doesn't want to fight. We want to see him fight. He still doesn't want to fight. Then he fights and kicks everyone's ass. He should just fight.""

","Lionheart (or A.W.O.L. - as i tend to refer to it) in my opinion is possibly Van-Dammes best film.... and yeah I'm biased! It has a very decent storyline which is realistic - especially as its set in America and features some well know actors such as Deborah Rennard, Brian Thompson and Harrison Page.",/review/rw0284929/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 1999,gridoon,5," Routine but acceptable.
","""Lionheart"" is mostly routine genre fare: a series of mildly spectacular (if thoroughly predictable) fight scenes, linked together by a tiresome (if honest) ""emotional"" plot. However, I've always found Van Damme much more likable than most of his ""antagonists"", mostly because the violence in his movies never goes over-the-top, and his likability makes this humdrum picture acceptable.",/review/rw0284929/?ref_=tt_urv
