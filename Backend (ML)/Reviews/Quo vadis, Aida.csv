6 March 2020,clarkishome,7," A GOOD P.I. MOVIE!
","I was a fan of the original Spencer for hire series on TV. Seeing that Mark Wahlberg was raised in the Boston area this is a just right fit for him.
Having grown up in many different cities, including the Boston area , this movie brings a lot of memories back. Wahlberg brings his unique sarcasm, wit and physical presence to the role. Although it is somewhat different than the series, it is a good PI movie that you will enjoy. The thing that people have to remember is that you have to judge movies based on categories. This will never win an Academy award, but I would not compare it to titanic or pretty woman because that's not the type of movie it is. This is an action, comedy, and some what of a mystery. If you're looking for a good action movie with unique personalities and some comedy thrown in, this is your movie, enjoy.",/review/rw5578134/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2020,TwistedContent,6," Typical Spenser the Vigilante
","Netflix makes a bunch of great stuff, often hits and misses, but in the niche of action/blockbuster movies, Netflix has a real knack for landing in the average and underwhelming section. ""Bright"" and ""6 Underground"" are spot-on examples & now ""Spenser Confidential"" has joined the bowl of expensive but mediocre action flicks.",/review/rw5578134/?ref_=tt_urv

","Don't listen to the ""critics"". We enjoyed the movie from start to finish. Why can't people just sit back, enjoy and not overanalyze a movie? Sure, we've seen it before but we know all the stories of the comics and Marvel and superheroes and Disney and we still watch it right lol",/review/rw5578134/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2020,heulnicht,6," I liked it
","Typical Mark Wahlberg flick with likeable actors. Nothing new, still entertaining. I don't get why some people have to analyse this kind of movies to death just because it's not Oscar material.",/review/rw5578134/?ref_=tt_urv

6 March 2020,mandorallen-the-lion,6," Good flick
",If you're taking this more seriously than that you weren't paying attention. There's not a moment in this movie where they submitted any requests for you to think higher of this than a fun flick. Try judging it on that.,/review/rw5578134/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2020,The-Sarkologist,7," Enjoyable Crime Drama
","Well, it seems that I got myself caught by the Netflix algorithm that suggested that this film was quite popular in Australia. Honestly, I probably should have done what I normally do and check the rating on IMDB to determine whether I actually want to waste my time watching it or not. Anyway, it did happen to star Mark Whalberg, and he does happen to be a pretty cool actor, and his movies aren't all that bad either, so I decided to give it a go.",/review/rw5578134/?ref_=tt_urv

","No need of convoluted staging or direction. This movie has a good pace, nice action, good jokes, animal love and likable characters.",/review/rw5578134/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2020,allanmichael30,7," Lots of action- fun to watch- great cast
","This is not real life or braking new grounds in story telling but fun to watch and would watch again as very entertaining. The main actor Spenser is like an X-men character that can heal as he gets smashed up, Mulled by dog, slashed by a machete and still carry's on.",/review/rw5578134/?ref_=tt_urv

24 May 2020,Floated2,6," Solid entertainment
","Nothing exactly special about this film. It is the typical Mark Wahlberg actioner, and directed by Peter Berg whom they made several great films together (Lone Survivor, Patriots Day), we knew somewhat what to expect. This is an upgrade from the underwhelming Mile 22.",/review/rw5578134/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2020,Reem750618,8," You know where it's going, but it stil is entertaining...
","If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie.
There's nothing new in the storyline and it has all been done, but if you like this kind of movie you'll have a great time. I liked the humor in it and the characters are likeable too. I'll gladly watch it again in a few months or so.",/review/rw5578134/?ref_=tt_urv

6 March 2020,dudewholikesthepits,1," Spenser in name only
","This is a weak action comedy that steals the names of established characters in order to try to draw an audience from fans of the books and/or show. There is NOTHING other than the character names and Boston that is from the books. These characters are not Spenser, Hawk and Harry. They are generic buddy comedy characters with the names from the novels pasted onto them. Whoever wrote this script appears to have never done more than glance at the cover of a Spenser novel nor even watched a single episode of the show.",/review/rw5578134/?ref_=tt_urv

7 March 2020,daderdog,5," Bait and Switch Spenser
","Whatever the good you can say about this film, it is NOT a Spenser and Hawk story. Whoever wrote it took the names of the main characters and glued them onto a random buddy cop story. I like Wahlberg and Arkin is a great actor. But there is nothing in this movie which Robert Parker would recognize as the great characters he created. The most disappointing part is Hawk. In the books and the original series, he is a force of nature - cool, deadly and competent. Winston Duke is probably is a fine actor, but they wrote the character as if he were Michael Oher in the Blindside.",/review/rw5578134/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2020,Otte1,4," Thinkers beware
","1. Mark Walberg cannot act in drama or action. He only has one squinted face on everything(comedy he does much better).
2. Just do your own movie, trying to make it a Spenser for Hire for the new generation means being compared to Robert Ulrich and Avery Brooks...and neither of these lead actors are in the same ballpark.",/review/rw5578134/?ref_=tt_urv

4 October 2021,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," Keep it quiet.
","'Spenser Confidential (2020)' is a detective action-movie centred around an ex-cop who gets into trouble when he immediately starts investigating the death of Boston's police captain after leaving prison. The film is basically what you'd expect, with a decent but generally uninspired mystery at its core and a handful of against-all-odds set-pieces. The movie is decidedly unfunny - to the point that most jokes wouldn't even register as such, never mind provoke a giggle, if I didn't know the thing was supposed to be part comedy - but its characters are typically rather enjoyable and its action is certainly serviceable. There isn't anything particularly interesting about the flick. Having said that, it moves quickly enough and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's not great, by any means, but it's just about effective enough to recommend to fans of either its star, Mark Wahlberg, or its director, Peter Berg. I wouldn't be surprised if Netflix springs a sequel on us sooner than we'd expect. 6/10.",/review/rw5578134/?ref_=tt_urv

",It was really nice and chill movie for night. It was right amount of action which I liked. Plot was easy to fallow but it wasn't something special or unique so I can't give more than 7. Still this movie is perfect for the night when you're in bed and want to rest and chill.,/review/rw5578134/?ref_=tt_urv
