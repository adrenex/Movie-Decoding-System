","Before I begin this review I've played other big name games, ranging in ratings that is. Such as The Witcher 3, Red Dead Redemption 2, Batman Arkham City, Portal 2, etc. Never have I played a game so human though as The Last Of Us.",/review/rw6281627/?ref_=tt_urv

",My The Last of Us review I'm so overwhelmed by this game right now. This game is like a delicious meal. When it ends you want so bad to have more of it but in some other way you are the most satisfied human being in the planet.,/review/rw6281627/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2013,newnoir,," One Of The Greatest Games Of All Time (So Far)
","The overall zombie/post-apocalyptic/infected/dystopian story may be somewhat trite, yet that doesn't halt The Last of Us from being one of the best and most cinematic video game experiences ever.",/review/rw6281627/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2013,Aqua_Fresca,10," One of the best games I've ever played.
","Leave it to a video game to produce the greatest zombie story since George Romero's Dawn of the Dead. Yes, the story is great. Yes, the voice acting is great. Yes, you get emotionally involved with the characters and everything that happens to them. With that said, though, The Last of Us is more than just a well-told story, it could very well be a sign of where the genre is headed, and if that's the case then colour me excited.",/review/rw6281627/?ref_=tt_urv

","I rate a ton of things on this site all the time, but I've never done an actual review. The Last of Us more than warrants one. I've never had a gaming experience quite like it. It transcends an average game.",/review/rw6281627/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2013,mrxelement,9," Fantastic Exclusive To The PS3!
","How far can you go to surviving in a world filled with no rules or exceptions. The cities being swallowed by the Earth's beautiful nature following up with a nasty infection of a fungus creating dangerous environments and even corrupting the mind and body who ever breathes in the spores making the person go rabid. Not only you're facing creatures ,but also your fellow man as they try to kill you no matter what the circumstances are. ",/review/rw6281627/?ref_=tt_urv

","When The Last Of Us was first announced I knew it would be a cut above most games but I didn't know it would be this good! For me Naughty Dog has had a flawless track record, with Crash Bandicoot, Jak and Daxter and Uncharted all possessing unique qualities. However, The Last Of Us manages to raise the bar set by all of these games, setting the bar for video game excellence, as we head into the next generation.",/review/rw6281627/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2013,adils786-591-208442,10," Quite possibly the greatest game of this generation...
","I know this has almost become clich√©d on IMDb but the greatness of this game has indeed caused me to write my first and only review. The Last Of Us is a unique game which captures the fragility of our social structure and demonstrates the brutality that some people are capable of. Don't pay any attention to nonsensical reviews by critics such as Polygon's Phillip Kollar who argues criticisms such as 'the game isn't fun' as it was never meant to be. The world that the game is based in isn't fun and this has been further emphasised by every trailer and demo that had been revealed prior to game's release. When playing on normal i felt like almost every encounter could be my last and i was equally terrified by the fact that Naughty Dog wouldn't hold back in showing just what the consequences of failure are. The game rather than focusing on horror revolves around the relationship between Joel and Ellie and this is masterfully complimented by the score which was composed by two-time Oscar Award winner, Gustavo Santaolalla.",/review/rw6281627/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2020,tashlast,10," I want a daughter just after playing this
","Holy moly quacamolely! I think I've found a game that is better than mostly all TV and film alike. Just...where do I start? I was made aware of this game a long time ago when it first came out, and I always knew it had stellar reviews, so I did buy the Grounded version and DLC package in 2015. Thing is- I never had the time to sit down and play it, because I'm the kind of person who likes to start and finish a game in one sitting. So since I could never find the time, it always just sat on my shelf collecting dust. Flash forward to 2020, inside quarentine and have nothing to do but watch and or play everything I already haven't. I was going through my video game collection and I remembered about the game, so I popped it into my PlayStation to play.",/review/rw6281627/?ref_=tt_urv

4 July 2013,subspace2010,9," Believe the Hype
","I've never been so moved by a video game. Terrified, awed and brought to tears in the first 20 minutes. This is the apocalypse and this is exactly how I have always imagined it would go down, quickly, brutally and without mercy or remorse. The realism here is intense. Initially there is chaos all around you. Cars crashing and exploding, buildings on fire, people running in all directions and the infected......These infected are fast and furious and not so much hungry for flesh as filled with pure rage and hellbent on killing all humans just cause....reminiscent of the rage infected undead from 28 Days Later. Whatever you do don't stop running. These are not Zombies as we know them, they are something entirely new and certainly not out of the realm of possibility, although an extremely far fetched one. I have been waiting with baited breath for this title ever since I heard of it's conception. I knew it would be something special, something different and Naughty Dog have certainly lived up to the hype. Visually stunning, superbly acted, this game is a work of art.",/review/rw6281627/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2013,rocklandparanormal,10," Proof that video games are truly an art form
","Naughty Dog have outdone themselves, and everyone else for that matter. At least when it comes to the ""survival"" genre of games.

25 January 2014,jonruff108,10," A Journey Worth Experiencing
","The Last of Us is a tale about pain. About love. About suffering. About friendship. About betrayal. About family. About death. It is one of the most well crafted, powerful, and emotional stories I have ever experienced in any medium. The Last of Us thoroughly delves into the human condition and doesn't let up. Right from the get-go, the story and masterfully written characters fully engulf you in a way that has never before been seen in a game and rarely in a movie. The amount of realistic writing and depth put into both the story and the characters is phenomenal. Throughout the roughly fifteen hour story you will find yourself caring about the characters and debating the meaning and differences between right and wrong. ",/review/rw6281627/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2013,galahad58-1,10," The First
","The Last of Us is another strong game from the makers of the Uncharted series--Naughty Dog. Like Uncharted, you have some of the best game acting and script writing ever present in the gaming world. The Last of Us presents you with one of the most intelligent, intriguing and wonderful stories ever to be presented in a video game.",/review/rw6281627/?ref_=tt_urv

","From the moment the game begins and with quite the harrowing telling and structure of it ... it really engages you to the best degree possible. I have not played the sequel yet (though I know of it and who is in it), I had no idea where this one was going ... anything was possible and anything could happen at any time. Great story, great game play and a lot of action and horror to entertain anyone who is into that.",/review/rw6281627/?ref_=tt_urv

8 August 2022,tesseractzv,10," The best story ever!
","I just love Ellie and Joel's relationship so much. They have such a heartwarming relationship. You know how rude they were to eachother at the beginning but as the story processes, their relationship processes as well. It's unreal how close I feel to them. I have never felt like this to any movie character. I love Joel and Ellie so much and I wish part 2 had more of their scenes in it and not just Abby for 10 hours.",/review/rw6281627/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,10," I want to talk about it.
","If I had to pick a favourite video-game, 'The Last Of Us (2013)' would be it. Frankly, it's one of the best games of all time. Everything about it is phenomenal, from its tense, captivating gameplay to its layered, emotionally devastating story. It's the combination of these two elements that make the experience as impactful as it is; its narrative is conveyed by every facet of its design. The most major reason for its success is its focus on character. Absolutely everything revolves around it, with each plot beat serving only to test and change the two leads - either in isolation or in relation to one another. They are some of the most well-rounded characters ever to be written, feeling truly real in a way few others do. As building blocks for a wider narrative soaked in grief but tinged with hope, they do exactly what they need to and more. You really do care about them, as well as mot of the people you meet on your journey. It's difficult to describe just how compelling the game is; it constantly has you on the edge of your seat. It's also remarkably nuanced, never content with taking the easy route. Though its story is what makes it something special, its gameplay shouldn't be discounted. It's brutal, exciting, suspenseful and intense, fitting the established world and tone perfectly. Its violence doesn't feel fun, it simply feels necessary - a vicious fight for survival every step of the way. The two main types of enemy - human and infected - act as nice counterpoints to one another and genuinely feel distinct. It's fantastic to play. The visuals are beguilingly beautiful yet hopelessly desolate, and its soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful (up there with the very best musical scores of all time). It's all just so good. It's an experience that will actively affect you, which is incredibly rare for a video-game. You'll smile, you'll cry, you'll gasp and you'll grip your controller tighter than you've ever gripped it before. It's an absolutely brilliant game that everyone should play. 10/10",/review/rw6281627/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2022,thomasmalcolm-43439,10," Absolutely unreal
",I've played this game all the way through 10 plus times and I always get lost in it. It just captures you from the graphics to the story. It's just perfect for me and still stands very highly up there against most if not all other games.,/review/rw6281627/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2023,claszdsburrogato,9," The Last of Us (2013) A masterpiece of videogames - 9.7
","One of the most famous Playstation exclusives and certainly one of the best games in video game history. Everything about this game is basically perfect, from the story to the setting. The evolution of Joel and Ellie's relationship is beautiful, because you can feel that the two are gradually becoming father and daughter. The two go through tense situations, bordering death and still manage to have beautiful moments together. The fact that Joel's daughter killed makes their relationship much more dramatic. You can even see how Joel starts to feel more comfortable opening up to Ellie as the game progresses. The setting of this game is wonderful, all of it is very well presented with the amazing art direction of this game. Everyone who has the opportunity to play this game should play it, you will never regret spending hours following such a beautiful and suspenseful story. It would easily enter the best games in history, for everything it carries and for its influence not only in games, but also within cinema. Inspiring even the movie Logan.",/review/rw6281627/?ref_=tt_urv

","I Can say that this is game is a masterpiece every single thing of this game, the characters, the soundtrack the story and ambience are totally out of this world I can't describe how important this game is for me, I bought it last year and I'm too close to get the platinum trophy it's been a long year playing and playing to get the survivor, hard, easy, and normal two times, plus ones, and I really enjoyed it, I can play it a million times and I'm still having fun. I would totally Recommend this game for everyone because this game bro is totally a post -apocalyptic zombie world, you'll promess.",/review/rw6281627/?ref_=tt_urv

","Man this game was so beautiful. I didnt even play it tbh, i just watched its playthrough like 5 times. Thats when you know it's good. Cuz it takes so many runs to get sick of it. And it still stayed with me as a wonderful memory. Please make more games like these. The dlc wasnt so great, neither the last of us 2. Please make more games like the last of us 1 naughty dog!!!",/review/rw6281627/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2020,Keemshave,10," One of the greatest stories ever told.
","In every way, except for the technical aspects, superior to the sequel, but with the release time, that is to be expected. Emotional, intense, and awe-inspiring, The Last of Us hits the nail on the head. I never felt attached quite like this to characters, especially in a video game. This game was a perfect experience and one that I chose, with multiple play-throughs, to relive over and over again.",/review/rw6281627/?ref_=tt_urv
