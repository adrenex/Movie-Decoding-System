",Surprised at fellas who are complaining about John Cena's acting. The movie is funny and moved at a nice pace. The jokes are not very crude n ther is zero nudity.,/review/rw7287472/?ref_=tt_urv

","Well done to all the cast, what a hilarious movie, I haven't been laughing so much for quite some time.",/review/rw7287472/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2021,deloudelouvain,8," I laughed much more than I was expecting.
","For some reason when I saw John Cena's name appearing I wasn't too excited about watching this movie. Wrestling characters are to me, fake and very annoying to watch but I have to give it to him as I thought he was very funny as an actor. As was the rest of the cast in Vacation Friends. I laughed a lot with this comedy and I wasn't even baked so maybe the next time I'll rewatch this little gem I will get stoned first to have the ultimate experience. The story is simple, easy to follow, and has some really good moments of comedy. Maybe it's not for everyone but that's always the case with comedies as everybody has a different taste of humor. In my case, Vacation Friends is just the right kind of humor that I needed and enjoyed.",/review/rw7287472/?ref_=tt_urv

","When Marcus (Lil Rel Howery) and Emily (Yvonne Orji) plan a romantic Mexican getaway, things get wild when they befriend Ron (John Cena) and Kyla (Meredith Hagner). What Marcus and Emily thought was just a vacation friendship, turns a real nightmare when Ron and Kyla turn up.",/review/rw7287472/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2021,paul_haakonsen,6," Genuinely funny...
","Well, this movie actually turned out to be a surprise. Yeah, initially I hadn't really expected much from it, as it was a comedy with John Cena in one of the leading roles. But I opted to watch the movie, and give it a fair chance.",/review/rw7287472/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2021,margineanvladdaniel,8," So grateful that I was surprised, in the good way! Thank you! üôèüèª
","I had more laughts than the rest of the movies that these past two years were released. Felt good. Happy to see John again and doing great. Had some Kevin Hart vibes sent from Lil Rel, they were on point, hit right the spot. Liked it! It was pretty well wrapped. Looking for more projects like this!",/review/rw7287472/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2021,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," Like a holiday you know you enjoyed but can't really remember.
","'Vacation Friends (2021)' is a surprisingly good, if by-the-numbers, comedy starring Lil Rel Howery, John Cena, Yvonne Orji and Meredith Hagner. It focuses on a couple who go to Mexico for a high-calibre holiday and get engaged in the lobby because their expensive, decked-out suite has flooded due to the upstairs neighbours overfilling their hot tub. Those neighbours learn of the situation and offer to host the couple for the duration of their holiday, working their way into their lives and pretty much forcing their care-free attitude upon them. The first half of the flick is, essentially, just a series of skits showing the four new friends partying hard and getting to know one another. The second then takes things back stateside and reunites the foursome at the engaged couple's fancy, country club wedding, where the vacation friends' previously mentioned care-free attitude causes some tension with the rather conservative and judgemental family members in attendance. The flick is entertaining enough for what it is. It hits every beat you expect it to, but its cast are likeable enough that you don't really mind how predictable it is. It's usually enjoyable just to watch the focal foursome interact with one another; the affair is always rather affable. It isn't hilarious, but it has its fair share of humorous moments and does provoke laughter on a few occasions. It isn't great, but it's good enough. Though it's not something you'll likely remember for very long, it's a relatively fun and lighthearted way to pass an evening. 6/10.",/review/rw7287472/?ref_=tt_urv

29 August 2021,bryantbarry,8," I had fun
","For a free Hulu comedy with an A list cast, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. No, it will not win any oscars but if you enjoyed ""Blockers"" this is for you. Make a drink. Sit back and have fun.. that's what movies are for right??",/review/rw7287472/?ref_=tt_urv

30 August 2021,archetypegrice,8," Fun to watch
","Fun movie where the characters happen to be of different races but they don't make a big deal about ""race"", have stupid offensive racial jokes, or bring up the topic at all. Refreshing.",/review/rw7287472/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2021,nouyrigatantoine,7," a good surprise

11 September 2021,nlgthunder,8," Funny, Sweet, and Entertaining
","I definitely think this movie is underrated. This cast was wonderful together! This is the best movie I've seen of John Cena, he was great and so was everyone else, down to the parents and siblings.",/review/rw7287472/?ref_=tt_urv

11 September 2021,kevin_robbins,7," This is a nice addition to the comedy genre that's entertaining but a step below the Hangovers of the world
","Vacation Friends (2021) is a movie my wife and I watched on Hulu. The storyline follows a conservative couple who run into an over the top party animals couple that are hardcore into drugs, alcohol and the eccentric. Due to a series of unfortunate circumstances they have to be together for vacation and have the most amazing time but the conservative couple wants to lose touch with them forever and forget they ever met. When the conservative couple start planning their wedding activities their party animal vacation friends arrive and threaten to ruin the entire event...or make it more fun than they could ever imagine. This movie is directed by Clay Tarver (Silicon Valley) and stars Lil Rel Howery (Get Out), Yvonne Orji (Insecure), John Cena (Trainwreck), Meredith Hagner (Hits) and Lynn Whitfield (Eves Bayou). The storyline for this is absolutely crazy, random and unpredictable. The comedic content goes back and forth from hilarious to awkward but definitely has a nice amount of laugh out loud moments. The cast is perfectly selected and really make the comedic content work. Overall this is a nice addition to the comedy genre that's entertaining but a step below the Hangovers of the world. I'd score this a 6.5-7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",/review/rw7287472/?ref_=tt_urv

27 August 2021,mklarsen-51895,7," Just learn to float
","Not a bad movie at all. Just relax, don't take it seriously and learn to laugh. It has some great pieces and funny moments. It won't win an oscar but the dichotomy between Marcus being so serious and Ron being so casual is great :)",/review/rw7287472/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2021,gabby-1234,8," Nice movie
","I liked this movie a lot! Of course is very predictable, but it's cute. I thought that Cena was funny. The guy who played Marcus is like Kevin Hart but less funny. Yvonne is very nice and the blond lady too.",/review/rw7287472/?ref_=tt_urv

",This movie doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is; fun and goofy. Switch your brain of and enjoy it. John Cena and Meredith Hagner steal the show. Cena's body is crazy big!!,/review/rw7287472/?ref_=tt_urv

",The Good- I liked the concept of this film about meeting two crazy people of holiday and not wanting to bring them into your everyday lives. It's something everyone can relate to I'm sure. The comedic timing in here is great from the secondary couple. John Cena is perfect for this role.,/review/rw7287472/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2021,WatchAndSmile,8," Thought it would be Meh, but It was GOOOOOD!!!!
","Watched the trailer and was like, meh, maybe a typical boring story, bad acting and some comedy in between with barely anything good, but I WAS WRONG. Great crazy story, great comedy, acting and some interesting message too. I truly enjoyed this comedy. A lot of LOL moments.",/review/rw7287472/?ref_=tt_urv
