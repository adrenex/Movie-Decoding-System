26 September 2017,planktonrules,9," Not at all the type of film I usually watch...but I did enjoy it and am glad I saw it.
","Of all the different genres of films, I think modern horror is probably my least favorite. I love old horror films...mostly because they aren't extremely graphic and leave a lot to the imagination. But this is a case which proves I can be won over by a violent modern horror pic. The only reason I saw this one at all is because my daughter wanted to see it...and I didn't wanna disappoint her.",/review/rw3800615/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2017,mr_bickle_the_pickle,6," Where was the tension?
","I think the film was good, but didn't really live up to expectations. I didn't find it that scary. Admittedly, one of the jump scares worked on me but otherwise I never felt any dread looming in the pit of my stomach. The film is gorier than the mini series. That's for sure. And I liked that updated aspect, but nothing particularly shocked me. There was quite a bit of special effects that just were not very good. And I think that's a big reason why I just wasn't very scared.",/review/rw3800615/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2017,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,2," Extremely over-hyped, a cringe-worthy missed opportunity
","I'm a huge fan of the 1990's TV film of ""It"", especially for its aesthetics and soundtrack, but it left out a lot of content from the original novel, leaving me confused when I first saw it at the age of 12. This remake, or perhaps actually a ""re-adaptation"", is certainly very timely, what with ""Stranger Things"" becoming so huge with pretentious hipsters everywhere. I'm still not sure it hits the ""scary"" factor very well, especially without Tim Curry's tremendous acting, but it's certainly creepy. It's not nostalgic though, nor does it retain much of the original novel, including the 50's setting, changed to the 80's to obviously market itself with ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Goonies"".",/review/rw3800615/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2019,cherold,8," exciting although surprisingly un-scary
","Like the miniseries Stranger Things, It hearkens back to 80s filmmaking, falling somewhere between Stand By Me and Poltergeist. While ostensibly a horror movie, in spirit it is more a coming-of-age drama with a monster.",/review/rw3800615/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2017,barbagvido,8," It is pretty good, but a bit too conventional
",It is a new adaptation of Stephen King's novel of the same name about a mysterious entity that shows up every 27 years to feed on children. Sometimes in the form of something they are most afraid off and sometimes just in the form of the clown and then this group of kids tries to put an end to the whole thing.,/review/rw3800615/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2017,davispittman,7," Entertaining but could've been better
","It (2017) was a pretty good movie overall, most of it was entertaining and well made. I will say that it wasn't as good as I expected, there were parts that could have been better. Well first the positives. One of the positives is the acting, great performances were given by all, I was impressed by the child actors, clearly very talented. I think the child actors really committed and showed the level of talent that you'd usually see in an adult actor. The special effects were also very well done. Pennywise's look was well put together and all the wild effects with him looked good. The beginning sequence was very well done, I loved the exchange between Pennywise and Georgie. The middle part of the film was alright, it had good acting and it set up everything for the finale, but to be honest, the beginning and the end were great, very well done, and I felt like the middle portion was alright, but my mind wondered some and I just felt like there wasn't enough substance to the middle part of the movie. Yes, the characters were good and the acting was still good in the middle, but I feel like the story needed more support in that section. I haven't seen the original Tim Curry It miniseries yet, so I cannot compare the two, all I know is that the original is basically like two films in one. I am excited for an It 2, which I feel is on its way since the original had two parts to it. All in all, a 7/10. Overall enjoyable, and I was entertained by the end of it, even though there were places in the movie that could've been better.",/review/rw3800615/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2022,coreycitn63,8," 1989 was a mistake
",It was a mistake of changing the time from 1957 to 1989 with the kids to make it more contemporary with modern viewers. No child in 1989 would sail a paper boat even though Georgie was about six years old.,/review/rw3800615/?ref_=tt_urv

","Novels by Stephen King are not seen as real literature, but adaptation of these novels can result in very good films. I am referring to films such as ""Carrie"" (1976, Brian de Palma), ""The shining"" (1980, Stanley Kubrick) and ""Misery"" (1990, Rob Reiner).",/review/rw3800615/?ref_=tt_urv

20 September 2017,tyreeewebster,8," IT- ""You'll Float, too...""
","It's fair to say that recently, Hollywood has had an over reliance and abundance of horror remakes and ""re-imaginings"", from 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' to 'Halloween' to 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'- all with varying degrees of critical and financial success (although, they tend to make the BIG BUCKS. Most of the time, we don't need them, but every once in a while a remake comes along and knocks it out of the park and into the sewer drain!",/review/rw3800615/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2017,rabbitmoon,6," Starts well but gets boring fast once you realise there is no goal
","The opening scene of IT is so promising - well directed, atmospheric, and Skarsgard's clown is compelling to watch. There is a brief moment where while laughing mutually with the kid, the clown suddenly goes quiet and stares menacingly. Its brilliantly unsettling. But sadly, that's it as far as unsettling clown performances go - the rest of the film is typical CGI scares, and the clown throwing out taunts like the deriative satire of Scary Terry in Rick and Morty.

17 September 2017,ironhorse_iv,8," Even with some flaws, this horror movie still had the IT-Factor. It was very entertaining.
","Once upon a time, clowns used to bring out, joy out of children. Then, author, Stephen King's 1986's horror novel, 'It' came out of nowhere and nearly destroy that industry; by causing 'coulrophobia' AKA 'the fear of clowns' to become more common. While, it's true, that a few scary tricksters in novels, had existed for a very long time; such as author, Edgar Allen Poe's 1849's short story 'HopFrog', 1892 Italian opera, 'Pagliacci', and most recently, the Joker from Detective Comic's 'Batman' fame from the 1940s. Stephen King's novel takes the carnivalesque performance into a bizarre, but interesting direction by having a mysterious out of this world being, exploited the fears and phobias of its childhood victims by disguising itself with the form of a clown, in order to devour them. If you think, this plot already sounds crazy. I haven't gotten to, the outrageous meat of this novel; which includes under-aged gang-bang, statues of Paul Bunyan coming to live, cosmic turtles, and odd rituals against Universal Movie Monsters. Not only that, but the book was divide, by two major story arches: one focusing on the kids, trying to survive, and the other chapter, the kids reunited as adults to finally attempt to kill the beast. All of this, is way too much for a story! It's come across, as muddled, excessive, and highly gimmicky. That's why, this novel is highly regarded, as one of Stephen King's weakest books & often view as not filmable. Nevertheless, it didn't stop, movie studios from trying; as in 1990, the novel was adapted into a television miniseries starring Tim Curry as the demonic clown. For the most part, the miniseries was a lot better than the book as it omitted a lot of the craziest, and stupider stuff, however, it was still total crap for its bad acting, awful cheesy effects, and pacing issues. Although, the miniseries has many flaws, it has gather, a cult following over the years to the point, that a remake was welcome. In 2017, we got that reboot, and it was surprising, pretty damn good. Not perfect, but entertaining enough, to overlook, its flaws. Directed by Andy Muschietti, with a screenplay by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman. The film really does a good job, cutting the fat. Instead of a dual anachronic order narrative, the film purely focuses on the development of the characters as children; meaning no awkward repetitive flashbacks; making more of a tighter film. However, there was still a structure for this coming to age horror movie, I didn't like. The way, the film intermixed the lighthearted comedy like boy bands with the disturbing imagery aspect of dead people was a bit jarring. It was kinda weird to see characters, in a state of unpleasant anxiety, one second, due to an attempt attack by Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård) or sadistic bullies like Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton), only for a few minutes, be alright to go outside to hang out with friends at the lake. Also the idea, that these children would be alright, in staying in a town, where a mysterious creatures kills people, the whole summer, was also a bit unrealistic. In truth, these children should be, more scar for life & living in paranoia, than they were. They should be locked up in their house, ready for anything, since the movie never explain, how Pennywise can get you, or not. The idea that they can coexisted with this creature, around, is, insane. Also, the span of the tragic events, should only, take, place, during a couple of days, not weeks. Furthermore, the third act of one of them, getting caught, a month after the last attack, seems a bit force, rush, and highly clichés. The whole damsel in distress, love triangle third act was not great. Despite that, the CGI visual effects and practical makeup effects were great, during the action moments. Lots of really frightening moments like that projector scene; throughout the movie; only a few of them, were duds, like the leper. I just wish, the movie could be, a little more subtle with some of the jump scares like they did with the creepy librarian and the television show playing in the background. Way too many loud noises, kinda ruins the suspense. Nevertheless, Bill Skarsgård does a great job as Pennywise, even if the film doesn't attempt to make his character seem, that deceiving as a villain. I love how one of Pennywise's eyes is always fixed on the camera, giving the impression that he can see the audience watching the movie. So creepy. As for the children, the acting from them, is also great. Mad props goes to Jaeden Lieberher, Sophia Lillis & Finn Wolfhard as Bill Denbrough, Beverly Marsh, and Richie Tozier. They did a hell of a job, making these characters, seem real. I really got the loss of innocence story, even if the update piece remind me of a gorier version of Netflix's TV Series, 'Stranger Things', with its homage to 1980s nostalgia. Overall: It's a must watch from me. Highly recommended. Even, Stephen King himself was very happy with the movie after seeing it early. 'It' was a fun enough thrill ride. This movie truly does float.",/review/rw3800615/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2017,achyutaghosh,7," light on scares
","So I went and saw IT, and came back unimpressed. I mean it was a good movie, no doubt about that. A bunch of kids, outcasts in their own right, being terrorized by an ancient demon that plays upon the fears of its victims is pretty much the standard in Hollywood horror movie territory. All the kids are well cast, the script is funny and tight, and there are plenty of monster shots. The cinematography is great, the pace is even and the CGI is flawless. But is more funny than terrifying- it's R rating more a justification of teenage slang in the script, rather than for true scares. ",/review/rw3800615/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2017,zkonedog,10," Exceeded Even My High Expectations
","Stephen King's book ""It"" is my single favorite fiction novel of all-time. I have read it a number of times and am completely and utterly absorbed by its atmosphere and characters. As such, despite the big buildup, promising trailers, and positive reviews, I wasn't sure that this new film adaptation could ever quite live up to my extremely heightened expectations.

7 September 2017,drforeman,1," Nothing you love about It is in this movie.
","Nothing. This was a staggeringly ham-fisted approach to either King's novel or the miniseries based on it. It missed the point utterly... You will not see a group of children whose shared bond enables them to overcome a monster. You will see a load of bickering kids who seem to barely tolerate each other come together briefly to rescue the kidnapped object of their pre-teen lust. You will not see an intelligently-written story. You will see a dumbed-down, by-the-numbers screenplay, complete with the usual beats, Crisis of Faith, Catharsis, and all. You will not see belief overpowering evil. You will see a ten-minute fight scene where every kid tries to out-cool every other kid and get off a Schwarzeneggerian one-liner.",/review/rw3800615/?ref_=tt_urv

21 September 2017,henryluck,9," IT (2017) Review
","Great horror films are rare these days mainly because most of them are redundant sequels and remakes that do very little to aid the story or the scares. Even though this 2017 version of IT is a remake of the Stephen King classic, it is one of the best horror films I have seen in a long time. With killer clowns, death of children and monsters attacking you left and right, what's not to love? The film follows the same plot as the massive first part of the classic 1986 novel with the second half to be finished in a sequel. Seven children are being hunted and prayed on by a child-eating alien disguised as a clown known as Pennywise for each of their own fears and traumas. One child in particular, Bill Denbrough (Jayden Lieberher) is obsessed with founding and defeating the clown because he believes he will also find his younger brother who was captured by the alien months earlier with many believing him to be dead.  This makes us connect emotionally with Bill as well as the other characters who have fears of their own such as Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis) the only female of the group who is sexually abused by her father. This formula can be repetitive but it is terrifying when each child has their own encounter with Pennywise. Cinematography is also to great effect in IT. Camera movement gets incredibly shaky during intense chase scenes but the camera also takes the time to slow down to explore the emotionally levity of some scenes. Shadows are used effectively to add to the sinister nature of the film like the sewer locations where the unknown evil of Pennywise lurk. The actors of the children also act well in their current surroundings and reasonably act like coming of age children. Bill as mentioned earlier is obsessed with finding IT and his younger brother and due to his young age acts impulsively without much consideration of his actions or his friends like any coming of age child would. CGI can look pretty suspect in a few scenes with Pennywise. When he starts attacking, he does these really forced shaky motions that can take away from the scene a little bit, but not enough to ruin the horror and tension of the scenes. For any horror fan, IT is an absolute must see, especially in the dark of the cinema.",/review/rw3800615/?ref_=tt_urv
