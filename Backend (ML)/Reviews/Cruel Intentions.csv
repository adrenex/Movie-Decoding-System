17 July 2022,mjb301086,7," Really don't get the hate
",It wasn't the best Pixar film but it definitely wasn't the worst. Why it gets such a low score on here I'll never know. I'll admit the trailer did make it look better than it actually was but it was still decent and funny.,/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv

30 June 2022,brianjohnson-20043,7," The movie is ok. Many of this film's reviewers seem nuts
","This film seems to spark a lot of people to say that this film is completely terrible or that it's completely fabulous because it included a gay relationship in the periphery of the main story, and to an even lesser extent, a convict character who is sympathetic. So. I'll address that quickly: None of that seemed like a big selling-point or issue with the movie to me. And those reviewer who make the movie all about those things seem to say more about themself in their review than the movie itself.",/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv

4 July 2022,ericstevenson,7," Oh well, I liked it
","""Lightyear"" is the defictionalization of the movie that exists in the ""Toy Story"" Universe and seeing as how any ""Toy Story"" movie is my favorite animated movie of all time, I just had to see it and...it's not bad at all. Look, I know that many people were angry about the twist that Emperor Zurg is Buzz in the future and I wasn't a fan of it either. I still felt that this was a fairly unique film. It isn't a ""Toy Story"" movie at all, it's a Buzz Lightyear film. The plot is that Buzz is trying to reach hyperspeed but keeps failing and ends up time traveling four years into the future. The last of these (and his only success) results in a world ruled by Emperor Zurg and I already told you the spoiler.",/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,Seb_3,7," This isn't as bad as everyone is claiming!
","I don't get the bad reviews! The score at the time of writing is pretty horrible, and I don't understand. This isn't the best from Disney and Pixar, but it is a great addition and a clever way to tell a new story set in the Toy Story universe. It brings great animation and the array of emotion that we have come to love from the studio.",/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,FeastMode,4," Not good
","This movie isn't terrible. But it's not good. As a comedy it fails. I laughed only a few times, almost exclusively at the cat. Most of the jokes were crickets in my audience and a bunch made me roll my eyes.",/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2022,jpmock,8," Pretty good
",Wow I just can't believe the bad reviews. I use imdb scores and written reviews religiously and 95% of the time u think they are spot on. I watched this with my family and we were all very entertained throughout the entire movie. That should say enough. It was pretty well done and interesting.,/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2022,Rectangular_businessman,6," Sox steals the movie
","While I personally don't dislike this movie, I think the overall result is a little bit forgettable, far below the usual quality Pixar used to have in their classic films such as Finding Nemor, Up, or Ratatouille.",/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2022,bbevis-47954,4," Mediocre
","I enjoyed the first thirty minutes or so of Lightyear. The pacing was decent and the humor/heart was in the right place. Once the twist in the trailer happens the story becomes a beautifully predictable entry for Pixar, and my five year old became incredibly antsy to leave the theater. Socks steals the show but that isn't enough to enliven a boring plot. Wait for Lightyear to stream on Disney+.",/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,masonsaul,8," Great sci-fi adventure
","It may be Pixar's most straightforward film so far but that doesn't stop Lightyear from being another gorgeously animated installment and a great sci-fi adventure that's thrilling, funny and emotional, with the odd twist and heartfelt message up its sleeve as well.",/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2022,Jithindurden,7," Solid Pixar movie
","This doesn't feed on my nostalgia for Toy Story. This doesn't feed on my nostalgia for Buzz Lightyear of the Star Command animated series either. But it really seems that, other than the bigots who hate this for their made-up offensive content everyone who hated this didn't like the idea of not catering to nostalgia.",/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2022,jeremycrimsonfox,3," A Film That Fails To Go Infinity And Beyond
","Lightyear is a spin-off the Toy Story franchise, and a film-within-a-film, as the intro text has it as the movie that resulted in Andy getting his Buzz Lightyear action figure. In this, Buzz Lightyear tests a new hyperfuel for Star Command that ends up taking him 84 years into the future, where the colony on T'Kani Prime is taken over by the evil Zurg, forcing him to recruit a team of misfits to fight back.",/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,subxerogravity,7," It's a mindless action-adventure film and I loved it!
",It's not bad at all.,/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2022,Paragon240,6," Lightyear is a decent film that overshoots its primary audience and crash lands as a decent movie but with a confused plot focused on adults rather than children.
","Lightyear is a confusing film. It's definitely not bad. It fills its runtime with funny characters and engaging conflict, but the story is a bad choice for a kids' movie. It borrowed Interstellar's time dilation concept and mixed it with an evil future self plot which felt out of place and left my toddler disengaged. I was guessing that Zurg would end up being the rookie from the beginning but who Zurg ended up being was disappointing. I did enjoy the film, but its themes and script felt like a space adventure written for adults shoved into Pixar animated packaging. Lightyear's identity crisis distracted some from the overall film, and its story bit off a bit more than it could chew.",/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2022,paul_haakonsen,6," Better than I had anticipated...
","Well, I have to admit that the 2022 Pixar and Disney CGI animated movie ""Lightyear"" was actually better than I had expected it to be. Granted, I wasn't much of a fan of the ""Toy Story"" movies, so I had some reluctance about watching ""Lightyear"". But eventually got to it, as my family wanted to watch it.",/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,Balnyetnikoff,3," Boring
","I saw this in the theater with my 6 year old. She fell asleep and I almost did too...boring, nonsensical, inconsistent, and worst of all, not funny. What was the point?",/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2022,kaefab,8," Wow such a low score
",Honest i was not really sure about this movie since its straight out of toy story.,/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2022,thekarmicnomad,6," An ok, generic, kids sci-fi movie
","First off, for better or worse, this has nothing to do with Toy Story - absolutely nothing.",/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2022,mattstone137,4," ""Zurg.""
","""In 1997, a child named Andy bought a Buzz Lightyear action figure after seeing the character in his favorite movie. This is that movie."" These sentences precede Lightyear, a gorgeously realized and superbly animated film which has also been finely calculated and sterilized to assuage those who greenlit its production. Despite its visual splendor, Lightyear is not always easy to look at, with the knowledge that a soulless, artless, superficial corporate entity has hollowed out the insides, and is wearing the film like a glossy, finely crafted skinsuit.",/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2022,bryvill,8," Almost Perfect!
","Honestly, I was quite hesitant seeing this film after seeing a lot of low reviews. I was planning to see it weeks ago and keep cancelling it, then I gave it a chance finally last night. I was initially expecting not too much, but surprisingly, it was good! A lot of emotional connections, wacky comedy and as always, visuals were at its best. If you just go see it, have an open mind and just enjoy the film as is. I do understand why many viewers gave a low rating, the pacing is not that exciting as a whole, need more plot surprises or twists, the tone of the flick is cater for older audiences or young audiences who like a bit a serious tone of animation. Again , go see it, you'll enjoy it!",/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,larshoeijmans,6," Not worthy of the 'Pixar' title
",Toy Story is a legendary franchise and Buzz Lightyear might be among the most iconic animated characters ever created. Taking risks and telling an unique story with these priceless assets is therefore a daunting task. A task which Pixar could not fulfill.,/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2022,schorschi100,3," A disappointment
","The film tries to become a prequel to the extremely successful toy story line. As such it fails miserably, not due to technical issues, but simply because the story sucks. It is inconsistent, carries nothing but clich√©s and failed punchlines along, and is full of loose ends, even for five-year-olds.",/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2022,AustinOswald,7," A Rebirth For Pixar
","Lightyear felt very nostalgic, yet very fresh at the same time. Pixar finally found a way to pay homage to its inspiration while also avoiding the the sequel/prequel trope. This film marked a much needed change of pace for Pixar. While not providing quite the thought provoking story we've come to expect from the company, Lightyear still managed to deliver a fun action sci-fi flick with loads of humor.",/review/rw8242838/?ref_=tt_urv
