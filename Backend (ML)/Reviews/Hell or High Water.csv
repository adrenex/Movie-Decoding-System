28 October 2019,Hitchcoc,2," Just Too Much
","I remember as a child when Universal decided to take all the monsters (Frankenstein's monster, the Wolf Man, the hunchback, Dracula, etc.) and have them all in the same movie. These were the worst of the series.. This is another case of too many characters, no plot, no substance. I guess it won an award for costuming but the characters demand that they be costumed to be the characters. Don't bother.",/review/rw3517886/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2016,room102,1," Awful
","My god, that was AWFUL. Just random made-for-trailer tiny scenes that add to nothing, have zero depth and don't make up a coherent plot. Wall-to-wall inappropriate songs that come at random times. Boring plot (if you can even call it that), boring and indistinguishable flat characters. Harley Quinn was annoying. Jared Leto did his best as The Joker but had absolutely nothing to work with - he just appears at random times for a few seconds and disappears. There's no depth and no story. If you've seen the trailers, you basically saw all the one-liners and ""money shots"".",/review/rw3517886/?ref_=tt_urv

30 September 2016,TheLittleSongbird,3," The potential was big, the waste of it was even bigger
","'Suicide Squad' didn't sound so bad in hindsight. The concept was actually pretty interesting and there is a good deal of talent in the cast. Unfortunately what should have been a winner turned out to be a sore loser, even more of a wasted opportunity than 'Batman vs. Superman'.",/review/rw3517886/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," I wish I could say otherwise but I can't lie like that.
",A film that utterly lacked any substance. There was promise at the beginning with a great opening introducing us to the anti-heroes which was awesome. And then.... Nothing? Stranded such a talented cast fighting comical looking goons and an anti-climax of a villian. The two stars are for Viola Davis and Margot Robbie who give their roles everything. Every other character is disposable and forgettable. And Jared Leto as the Joker? Lets say no more.,/review/rw3517886/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2018,Sleepin_Dragon,3," Not my cup of tea
","I sometimes feel a little disenfranchised as I'm not a liver if superhero type films, but I'll always compromise and see them. Perhaps I'm just unlucky, I was made to sit through Batman Vs Superman, and then this, I felt as if I were being punished. Two hours of wall to wall nonsense, there was virtually no plot of any kind, or what there was went over my head. I can't say the acting was bad, Will Smith I really liked, and despite not particularly being a huge fan, I'd say one of Cara Delevingne's better performances.",/review/rw3517886/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2016,Aaron1375,9," In some bizarre way, this film just clicked for me...
","I had heard that the reviews for this film were less than stellar so I was not sure what to expect. The reviews for Batman V Superman were not so good either, but I enjoyed that one and I am happy to say I enjoyed this one too. In fact, I thought it was more enjoyable than Batman V Superman. I cannot explain why, but it just really worked for me for some completely unknown and strange reason. Perhaps, it simply worked well with the myriad of mental issues I have and it blended well to form some sort of connection with my warped brain. I just do not know, but I am glad I enjoyed it as I took a gamble to see it in theaters and I would hate to shell out money for tickets and not like it. Not only did I like it, but the other two people I was with enjoyed it as well. It was not without its problems, which is why I give it a nine rather than a ten, but most of the issues are in the opening portion of the film. Once the squad is together and in the field the movie is off and running and it is nearly nonstop action the rest of the way.",/review/rw3517886/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2016,slowcloud,2," What's with these ratings? This is an exasperatingly bad movie
","I don't get the ratings here. This is a cut and dry poorly made movie and fans of the DC universe deserve better. I don't normally post my reviews here. But I have to share my take on this movie because it just wasn't good. I didn't even have to go into spoilers to show how terrible it is. Movie goers shouldn't mindlessly consume these films. Christopher Nolan set a high bar, but producers and studios need to step messing with auteurs and maybe we can get a quality DC movie:",/review/rw3517886/?ref_=tt_urv

9 August 2016,sHabbadooo,1," Apparently it's good to be bad, should be DC's tagline
","Where to start, where to start? This is probably the main problem of the DCU at the moment. They're playing catchup to Marvel, they see Avengers they want in. The problem is, Marvel have spent 4,5 & 6 movies setting it up. We care if Cap gets hurt, we understand the Hulks turmoil and we saw Starks motivation for donning the suit. But here we're introduced to a whole new cast, backstory and all, in 30 mins tops. It just doesn't work, it's rushed, it's lazy and it has no effect in making the audience care about these characters; which in a movie where the stakes are so high, does not bode well. So here's what I thought of each character:",/review/rw3517886/?ref_=tt_urv

7 August 2016,ayoreinf,8," Taking cartoon villains and making them flesh and blood one can root for
","It's about 8.5 worth of a movie in my book, for some real good acting and well written roles. That is, some well written roles, had it been true with all the characters in this movie, this would've been a real masterpiece, but all too often it did fall short of the quality performance of Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Joel Kinnaman. there are a few other solid performances which didn't get their characters developed enough to shine like these three, especially Viola Davis who's very good as the perfect government agent that sees nothing but getting their job done, but truth is her role is too one dimensional, and there was room for real depth here. Same is true with Jai Courtney and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Jared Leto, isn't bad in his role, but it's hardly a role to speak about, and he was hyped from here to forever, so it was a letdown. But the roles that were properly written were really superb and the three actors I mentioned did them great justice. This together with a reasonable plot and solid technical aspects of this production, make it a worth your while movie. But once again this could've been a lot better, and the fact it's not is plain shame.",/review/rw3517886/?ref_=tt_urv

","OK.So I'm a senior.But I've seen lots of Marvel/DC Comics movies. I really liked Ant Man last year because there was a story to it.Suicide Squad was filmed in my home town, Toronto.There was so much hype.But even my grown son hated it when we saw it.There's no character development. We wasted our money.Don't go to this disaster. You'll regret it no matter your age.During each scene, I was wondering what is happening.Because the lighting was so dark,I couldn't make out the action. There were times I kept asking myself why I had agreed to come to this film. The character,Harley Quinn, had this Brooklyn accent which didn't really fit in. The joker was a joke,not even scary or comical.This was the worst movie I have seen this year.",/review/rw3517886/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2016,savage1250,6," An overly hyped film and a very unfortunate disappointment
","Suicide Squad was a disappointment to me. May be I got hooked on the hype or was expecting too much from WB. This movie had a great concept that we saw on the small screen, both TV series and animated. For some reason, those formats did it better than this theatrical release.

5 August 2016,lillakurta,3," I am so-so sad :(
","I am really really disappointed to be honest. I was waiting for this movie for so long, I loved Suicide Squad in Assault on Arkham and I was so happy when the news arrived about the live action movie. And as a massive Jared Leto fan I was extremely happy they chose him for the role of my all time favorite character, Joker. So I was hyped to see him, but the whole gang too. And what I got from the movie was equal with pure sadness. I mean, Jared was in it for a total 10 minutes and his role could have been easily left out, I only knew the characters because I read the comics and watched the wonderful animation (which by the way a 100 times better), the story telling was HORRIBLE, the actors could have been wonderful but they kinda lost in the terrible script. Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Viola Davis were fantastic but we didn't really get to know them... and the other characters were only there for... who know why? WHY DC, WHY? This story had so much promise and you ruined it... You should have adopted the Assault on Arkham into a live action movie... All these characters would needed a stand alone movie, and once we've got to know them then put them together... sure it would take years to build up a universe like that, but come on, that's what Marvel did and their movies are amazing! I am so, so sad right now... All of the actors deserve way better than this and they all have great potential",/review/rw3517886/?ref_=tt_urv
