19 December 2022,Supermanfan-13,10," One of the best shows ever created!
",It's hard to put into words just how much I love Animal Kingdom. It's such an incredibly underrated show. It's about J Cody (who's mother died of a heroin overdose) and has to move to Southern California to live with his Uncles who are 3 troubled brothers and their crazy mother who make a living doing armed robbery's and other criminal activities. Jay doesn't really like them because they never talked to or helped his mom (their sister) and he blames the family of her overdose. He gains their respect over time and become one of the leaders of the family. This show will have your heart pounding from all the excitement throughout the entire series. Once you start watching you're going to want to binge it as fast as you can.,/review/rw8616695/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2022,danielcereto,8," Almost perfect
","The show itself starts strong during the first 4 seasons. Unpredictable, raw, risky and includes great main characters. But who really steals the show are Smurf and Pope. Amazing from the beginning till the end.",/review/rw8616695/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2022,DiCaprioFan13,10," Awesome!
","I absolutely loved Animal Kingdom as it has quickly become one of my all-time favorite shows! It's not only one of the best shows currently on tv but it's also just flat out one of the best shows ever created! I'm just so impressed with how each season continues to be just as good as the others! If you haven't seen this incredible show yet and are looking for a show that will keep you on the edge of your seat every episode then stop what you're doing right now, do yourself a favor and go watch it...I promise you that you won't be disappointed! If you don't believe me all you have to do is look at the ratings or read through the reviews to see how loved this show really is!",/review/rw8616695/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2022,northernpaladin,8," Excellent crime drama
","This is as fine a piece of criminal drama as you will find anywhere and certainly the best of its genre in the past ten years surpassing the likes of Sons of Anarchy and Breaking Bad. The tale of the Cody california crime family, headed and dominated by 'Smurf' Cody (Ellen Barkin) is as compelling as it is repelling and we see it mainly through the agency of 'J', the teenage grandson, who is adopted into the family upon the death of his junkie mother, Smurfs daughter, Julia. The seasons have their fair share of daring heists, murder, betrayal, drugs and sex, but it's the slightly creepy interaction between Smurf and her boys that's the hook, I was interested at episode 1 and completely invested by episode 3. It's rare for a long running series to end better than it began but Animal Kingdom does that, not only because it wraps up all the various story arcs along the way but also because the reasons and motivations for everyone's actions is laid bare and revenge is definitely a dish best served cold. To be fair the series is not without its issues; the killing off of a major character two thirds of the way through was a risky strategy that doesn't completely pay off and the flash back segments take up too much run time despite the need for them in order to be able to fully develop the arc of certain characters - maybe this could have been better accommodated in an extended final season. In terms of performances, Ellen Barkin smashes it out of the park with a malevolent pastiche of her 80's/90's vamp roles, equally compelling is Shawn Hatosy in a long development arc as 'Pope' Cody. Worthy of special mention are, Finn Cole as the deceitful 'J', Jake Weary as Deran Cody, Leila George as Janine (young Smurf) and Jasper Polish as Julia. If you like crime drama watch this, you won't be disappointed.",/review/rw8616695/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,searchanddestroy-1,," Brothers, sons, mother and grand son of Anarchy
","Or How MA BARKER encounters POINT BREAK;;;
That's what I thought about when I began to watch this series. This matron, mother of a bunch of hoodlums who make you think of Patrick Swayze - Bodhi - James Le Gros - Roach - and all the gang of surfers, long haired, hippy likes armed robbers, seeking extreme danger and adrenaline jumps, living near Ocean side in California for POINT BREAK. How unusual, I admit, a family saga series where of course the awesome Ellen Barkin can also evoke Kathey Sagal in SONS OF ANARCHY, a strong woman living among a bunch of tough men, and a strong woman for whom the audience doesn't know what to think about her. A very ambivalent character. This series is for me a bit too long, but the ending is rather good, unusual, bitter too, but not excactly as I would have dreamed it to be. J character's fate is the biggest surprise in the finale.",/review/rw8616695/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,phanes-94831,8," Great until all the flashbacks in time.
","I real enjoyed this series, the way the brothers worked together but still had their issues. Also some of the capers were well thought out and we're at times really exciting. On a personal level, too much gay stuff for my liking which added pretty much nothing to the storyline. What kinda ruined it for me in the last few series was all the pointless flashbacks, it says to me that they were running out of a good story line but wanted to keep the series going. Overall a good watch and I would recommend it, not everyone has the same preferences as me and might not but so irritated by the small stuff.",/review/rw8616695/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2022,elishawin2005,7," It's over and I might kinda miss the Cody's
","Per usual, I was late to the party of ""Animal Kingdom"" but it didn't take me very long to binge all six seasons. When I started season four I wanted to come here to read the reviews but decided not to because I didn't want any other influence on my opinion of what was taking place with the Cody's. Now that it's over I was able to see my opinion was very similar to most. I was afraid things would start declining with each new series because that happens often. There were some things that they could have done without adding but it's not a deal breaker for me personally. Smurf's facial expression's and flaws were almost too much or weird in more ways than one but I just tried to overlook that part of it. I like a series that has character's I end up caring about or rooting for in some way or another and that happened here. The way it ended makes me think that there could be another season or even a spin off to see ""now what are you going to do"" but supposedly the 6th season was the final. I guess it's left to our imagination. If someone asked me for a good bingable scripted series recommendation I would definitely include Animal Kingdom, if they haven't already seen it because like I said, I was late starting it to begin with. It kept me entertained, intrigued and looking forward to each episode to see what was going on with all of the main character's.",/review/rw8616695/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,joshbernardy13,9," This is hard to let go..
","No lie, I was hooked from the very first episode. And although it does become a little redundant at times, and the flashbacks are a little annoying, I still give it a solid 9 stars. Definitely one of the most underrated series of all time (I stumbled on this series accidentally).",/review/rw8616695/?ref_=tt_urv

4 October 2021,skip-98756,8," Enough with the Flashbacks Already!
","Great storylines being ruined by trips down memory lane every few minutes..Give it a break, put it to rest and get on with the current storyline which is where the real interest is with viewers..These flashbacks served a purpose when smurf was in the story to flesh it out...At this point however, its absolutely ridiculous to keep forcing them down viewers throats... just stop.",/review/rw8616695/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2023,vittoriamartinetto,10," One of my favorite tv shows
","Animal Kingdom is one of those tv shows pleasantly addictive. No matter how your day went on, you always think: but tonight I plunge myself in Cody family's adventures, and I'm happy. It was from Breaking Bad, Sons of Anarchy and Peaky Blinders that I didn't have this feeling. The heist genre mixed with the clan/family mechanisms, a bunch of different and fascinating characters, an amazing cast, an exciting rhythm in the progression of the storyline, etc. (all the best you can say about a perfect tv product) is so exciting and overwhelming that I'll feel an orphan when I'll finish watch. I have just a bunch of episodes left and I'm already mourning!",/review/rw8616695/?ref_=tt_urv

2 September 2022,baybeh_girl,10," Love
","I love this show so much. Craig and pope are my faves but also jay. I like poor because he has a soft side. I don't know but there is just something about him. Also this sixth season they picked the best teenage pope!!! He killed the role and portrayed pope nicely! I love the chemistry between the boys. They all fit. So so goood
I love how jay takes control and runs stuff. He is smart, and has the brains. I have watched the series twice now ! And just finishing up the finale or the finale of the series. So depressed to see it come to a finish. I also really enjoy the flash backs. Getting to see how it all started. Not many shows do this but it fits well especially because of the type of show it is",/review/rw8616695/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,elbandito1250,8," Roller coaster ride
","This series from start to end feels like a roller coaster ride and it's also highly addictive. Great acting and each episode is suspenseful like hell. I'd even give it a 10 - but I feel I should rate the entire series here, so I have to cut 2 stars only for the final season.",/review/rw8616695/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2022,windsorenquirer,10," One of the best shows out there
","Lots of people complain about the flashbacks, I didn't like them at first either but then they got quite interesting. I didnt like the fact they killed Smurf, I missed her at first, the show wasn't the same any more without her but the flashbacks somehow filled the void.",/review/rw8616695/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,afiazuddin-00400,9," Animal Kingdom : Hands Down - one of the best tv dramas ever
","So I judge a series (and its finale) by how emotionally bothered I am afterwards. And how long that gnawing upset lasts. I am at 24 hours past the finale and I still need therapy. Lol. What a show! What a story line! What writing! What cinematography! And most importantly - what stellar performances by every member of that cast! ""Animal Kingdom"" (a very accurate title) centers on The Cody Family. Matriarch Janine Cody (""Smurf""), Andrew Cody, Craig Cody, Deran Cody, Baz Blackwell (adopted son), and Josh Cody. Andrew, Craig, and Deran are half brothers and all biological sons of Janine. Baz is an adopted (actually stolen) son. And Josh is Janine's 17 year old grandson, who joins the family after his mother Julia Cody (an estranged daughter of Janine) dies of a drug overdose. This is the quintessential Socal white trash crime family - except that they are particlularly smart and skilled. The series follows their family exploits in present time. The last three seasons add in a parallel story arc set 30 years in the past which tells the ""origin"" story of The Cody Family. The show is captivating. And while ""bad is bred"" - as the show's tagline reads - this is a ""bad"" that sucks viewers in. And in a way that only Hollywood knows, the viewer is left rooting for and ultimately shaken by the tribulations that befall The Cody Family.",/review/rw8616695/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2021,Hillius,7," Strangely compelling, but why?

3 September 2021,mklarsen-51895,9," Simply brillaint
","I remember watching Fin Cole since his days on Peaky Blinders and while he physically looks the same, he certainly shows his skills throughout this show. It's hard to work out what he actually feels about his family but the hatred at times shines through, especially knowing they lived a mile away and didn't do anything to save his Mum. Smurf cast her out of the family and J has never forgotten that. As the show moves through the seasons and you become more involved in the show and characters, I found myself liking Pope more and more. At first he seemed really creepy, especially standing over J's girlfriend in the bedroom but the more you learn about Pope, the more you feel for him.",/review/rw8616695/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2022,cosmochickita,10," Don't wish for a happy ending
","This show has always aspired to be gritty. It's based on a movie where most of them die. Why would people be disappointed with the ending, how else could it have ended. Wrapping it up with a bow, showing deran reunite with Adrian/Nick, J not betraying, Pople somehow surviving.... None of that would be true to form.",/review/rw8616695/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2018,tlawrenceintel,10," By Far The Best Show On Television!
","TNT certainly got it right with this show. In a rare case in which the series is far better than the movie it is based on, this show is excellent. Every character is drawn so deeply that you feel like you know them. You can't resist having a respect/hate relationship with Smurf. She is one wily fish. You watch as J goes from a snot-nosed teen to a full on criminal mastermind. The bond between Craig and Darren reminds you of your closest sibling. Then there's Pope. Wow! He is the show stealer. A ruthless, cold-blooded killer with a very soft spot for his niece. Talk about diametrically opposed feelings juxtaposed into a unreal situation. Admit it...if you met Pope on the street...your blood would run cold after one look at those ice cold eyes. In my opinion...and I watch a lot of these drama shows...this is as close to perfect as it gets. I would give it 20 stars if I could.",/review/rw8616695/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2023,kotsimbr,9," Incredible, raw, interesting, and BADASS
","Breaking Bad has always been my favorite show of all time but after just finishing Animal Kingdom; this might be even BETTER! The casting was perfect, the acting was incredible, and the story was interesting. So many amazing characters introduced that had powerful background history. The only reason I am not giving this show a 10 is because this could've easily gone on for another few seasons. I would've also added some burning questions that never got answered into the show. Honestly, this is a MUST WATCH. So amazing and beautiful. Im very upset its over.",/review/rw8616695/?ref_=tt_urv

","This show was great, it starts off slow but it picks up quickly. Everything about it was great. The characters, the story, and the ending! Phenomenal! Not usually the type of show I watch but I was hooked as soon as I started watching! The ending was great! The whole show had everything you want in a show! Drama, thrill, happiness, drugs, sex, controversy, betrayal, etc. Sad it had to end. Great job to everyone in the show and everyone who worked it! You can't pick one favorite character because they all have their story and you end up loving all of them. Even hating Smurf in the show you still like her. Don't have anything negative to say about it.",/review/rw8616695/?ref_=tt_urv

","Finn Cole attracted me to this series from Peaky Blinders and it's basically the same concept. A bad group of a family characters. It's a high quality series that's great for binge watching!!! Its not Emmy material but it's something that does exactly what I want from a TV series...its makes me totally excited to play the next episode and see what happens next!
Yes, the movie is incredible but it's perfect for what it did and Animal kingdom is insanely good at doing what it does.",/review/rw8616695/?ref_=tt_urv

","Animal Kingdom is easily one of my favorite shows I've ever seen. I heard such great things about it for so long but still put it off until recently. I can't believe how much I was missing out on, I binged the entire series as fast as I could. I have to admit that you have to give it a few episodes before you really get into it because it starts off pretty slow but before you know it you'll be addicted and wanting to binge it as fast as possible like I did. The writing and acting is what makes this show so popular. I can't say enough about this cast either, they're all great in this and will definitely all move on to bigger things because of this show.",/review/rw8616695/?ref_=tt_urv
