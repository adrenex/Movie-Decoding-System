","I loved the first season, then the cast was dumped. This show had so much promise then everything changed and the show did a complete nosedive. Whoever made the decision to change the cast the way they did should be drummed out of the business for being a complete moron.",/review/rw8332359/?ref_=tt_urv

20 May 2010,valjung,1," season 2 disappointing
","I enjoyed season 1. I like Gloria Reuben, the character of Sunny and her boyfriend Hunter, not to mention her interaction with her brother and her mother. Than I went to Season 2. I'm sorry, I like Vivica Fox, but she looks like a drag queen. The boss guy is a super jerk, even more so than Mr. Tori Spelling, and while I enjoyed Mark Conselous on All my Children, his character on here is boring. I just started watching the series on Netflix. I am on episode 3 of Season 2 and the acting is so bad and I find myself nodding off. At least I get to see Jess now on Private Practice doing brain surgery. I too watched Charmed, Medium and Bones, but you replace a whole cast with the most boring people you can find, than you have no show. I was also wanting to see what was gonna happen tween Gloria's character and Rick Fox. Oh well.",/review/rw8332359/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2003,robb_mavins,," Caterina Scorsone is amazing as Jess Mastriani
","I just had a chance to watch the pilot episode and Caterina Scorsone is amazing as Jess Mastriani, I sincerely hope this show gets a long run. The interplay between the characters is well crafted and I very easily bought into the premise. There was something about the understated & matter of fact way that Caterina Scorsone delivers her character's gift that works well for `suspension of disbelief'",/review/rw8332359/?ref_=tt_urv

6 December 2011,mollidew,10," Crime drama with a paranormal twist
","The premise of someone being struck by lightning, surviving and having visions isn't new but perhaps to fiction. This happened to Dannion Brinkley in real life. I liked both sets of cast and they did show Jess's Mom and brother within the framework of the second set of cast. The show was really about Jess and it evolved in a way I thought was very appropriate for her life to move forward. It highlighted others in the cast as well to make it multidimensional. I found no flaws in the acting or dialog. Mostly because I'm not a professional who teaches drama. I didn't think anyone was over acting due to the background of each character. Many times it was quite humorous in how they interacted which was of a level that relieved some of the seriousness of the topics they examined in the series. Fox's character was intense due to hard knocks in life she had to over-come where as Ruben came from a family that had money and prestige. I found all the characters explored in depth and the backgrounds of each playing a factor in how the part was portrayed by the actor. I don't compare Ruben or Fox because the characters weren't remotely alike other than being FBI Agents. I did like the first theme song better because it wasn't like all the others these days in the hip-hop style. It added to the uniqueness of the show but it may have had something to do with Ruben leaving why it changed. Louis Ferreira went by Justin Louis on this show so what IMDb has listed is incorrect in regard to billing. I loved all the seasons of this show with all the actors involved. I only wish that Lifetime had the foresight to hold on for another season and do more ads for it and people would have realized that Jess was growing older and in the show she evolved into a more mature individual with different dress and hair style. Sad a great show was cut short. I personally loved the series.",/review/rw8332359/?ref_=tt_urv

1 June 2006,flikchik9,1," Unbelievable
","I really thought this was going to be my cup of tea and it wasn't too bad when Gloria Reuben was in it but as soon as Vivica A. Fox took over it became totally unbelievable and the acting and directing is truly awful. I really like anything with the supernatural in and I love ""Medium"" with Patricia Arquette and also enjoy the old episodes of ""Charmed"" but this is just laughable. I think it has to do with the really bad acting of Vivica ( I don't dislike her ) but she delivers her lines so badly. I call it over acting, like every thing she says is exaggerated. am I the only one who thinks this? I cannot understand why this will nor be accepted. I have seen plenty of comments only a couple of lines long and this tells me I have to write 10 lines. this is the first time I've sent any comments in so I'd appreciate a little help with how it works. this programme does not warrant 10 lines!",/review/rw8332359/?ref_=tt_urv

26 June 2005,slackersmom,," How can people watch this show?
","I've seen this show once or twice (but ONLY because there's nothing else on Sunday evenings!), and I don't see how people can watch it. Vivica Fox is very stiff and conveys nothing except a stereotypical woman-proving-she-can-be-a-tough-detective. (Yawn!) If you ask me, she's trying way too hard. And the young girl with the visions... an interesting gimmick or ""hook"" for the show, but a little unbelievable. It seems like they rely on it too much and believe in it unquestioningly. The little I've seen of Mark Consuelos has been relatively positive, but the other guy, their leader, is a complete jack*ss. At least, from the episode I saw last week (about the little Chinese girl who went missing). I wish there was something better to watch on Sunday nights... maybe I'll stick with Discovery Channel.",/review/rw8332359/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2004,dec31_1959,," Lost a Fan
","I watched a few episodes of the second season and I have to say I miss our Canadian, Gloria Reuben A LOT. And what the heck did they do to Jess' hair?? Come ON !!! The character of Jess seems to have grown up and away from us in one season, I miss the old Jess ! Vivica Fox is okay, but she just doesn't have the elan, or the edge that Gloria Reuben brought to the show so I stopped watching. Bring back the old cast !! We miss them !! What the heck happened to Jess' family and Sonny, and the rest of the cast? We loved Sonny !! It was a nice thought to give Jess her own show but I think she needs the chemistry that the rest of the cast brought to ""1-800-Missing"". ",/review/rw8332359/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7," ""Have you seen this show? Call this number if you have any information that can help the investigation.""
","With a lot of series revolving around police work, including a handful or so already dealing specifically with this particular aspect/type, this needed a niche, something to call its own. What they came up with is to have the lead, Mastriani(who works as a psychic for the FBI, tracking down people who have gone missing), have strange visions, that are puzzle pieces relating to whatever case she's currently working on. If this sounds like a plot device and even a deus ex machina... then you're kinda right. It was, on several occasions. The role is played by Caterina Scorsone, a young Canadian girl who carries it quite well. Acting is a mixed bag at times. Quality ranges a bit. Where the first season was fairly straight-forward, the second replaces all characters but the main(and that was not entirely well-received, as viewers had grown attached to the people and relationships), stylizes it somewhat(adding, among other things, Vivica A. Fox and a new theme song with more of a rock music flavor), and gives it an ""edge"", represented by the attitude of the new token Black cast member, and Justin Louis as the tough-as-nails FBI Director Pollock. There was good and bad to the changes. I can imagine some abandoning it after so much of what they were(at the very least) used to being tossed out the window, in spite of the move clearly intending to attract a larger audience. I like both groups of episodes, in different ways. It was a classic crime-drama, with focus on the people. Then it became action-driven and cool, resembling newer television efforts in the genre. It never really stopped being a mostly passable mystery, and kept you guessing fairly nicely. I recommend this to fans of the concept, especially the supernatural portion. 7/10",/review/rw8332359/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2005,craigpaul,," Is the show this bad on purpose?
","It must be the director's fault, because every single person, and I do mean every one, does some of the worst acting on TV - the dialogue is terrible, so there's only so much the poor actors can do, but they don't do much. Every single scene looks like a MAD TV spoof. Such a shame - with all the talented people out there trying to get a break, that this kind of money and time is wasted on such an amateurish show is a pity.",/review/rw8332359/?ref_=tt_urv

","i cant believe people can say this show is unwatchable, its amazing. i love it and cant wait to see the next episodes. the actors are amazing and they make you feel like you are actually there. the girls are sexy and the men are handsome, what else do you want. in case you haven't watched it, its about a girl who was struck by lightening and now has visions about people who need help. she is now a FBI agent and uses her visions to help her. the story line sounds corny but trust me it is 1,000 times better when you watch it. if you are in the UK it is on living TV at 3 and 4. A MUST WATCH. if you like it when you have seen it, there are books which are just as good.",/review/rw8332359/?ref_=tt_urv

","This show had consistently compelling story lines and a great cast. While it was never going to break the mould, it was a show that I looked forward to watching each week. Caterina Scorsone was particularly good in the lead role, with Justin Louis and Vivica Fox in particular also giving fine performances.

","I am from the UK myself and i can't say that i even noticed it was called 1-800 missing or whatever in the first series! I agree that the theme song was really good but I am actually getting into this one now - the lyrics grow on you! I guess they had to change it - partly because it was Gloria R. who sang the 1st seasons and they got rid of her. I was angry at first that they changed all the actors as i loved the first series but i must say that i love this one too. It has a new freshness to it and i love the actors - especially v. fox - i think I just like the show for different reasons now. I am glad they changed it as I don't think it would have lasted had they kept it like it was. I like how we saw Jess's character grow up a bit and change. I love both seasons 1, 2 - and season 3. although i must say I don't know what It will be like if Antonio is actually dead as is mentioned in some of the US sites I have read - I haven't yet seen it in the UK.I love the chemistry between him and Nicole!",/review/rw8332359/?ref_=tt_urv
