5 July 2018,pensacolacomputer,1," Horrible
","First the trailer is nothing like the movie. NOTHING. I wish I would have been forewarned about it, but instead you think its going to be just another Purge movie, which I've liked all the previous ones. unfortunately Its not. ",/review/rw4857355/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2018,a_chinn,6," Weakest of The Purge films, but it remains a flawed but fascinating franchise
","This fourth installment in the fascinating, but flawed dystopian franchise, does succeed in begin exciting and never boring, but as with the prior films remains a disappointment considering the awesome and frightening premiss. However, in this film's favor, it does fill in some of the logic gaps of the previous films, answering some persistent lingering questions in this prequel of the first ever limited Purge on Staton Island, Are people really so depraved to go on killing rampages one day a year? How could the economy and crime rates improve as a result of a yearly purge? Who would benefit from such an event? Much is explained in this installment. The totalitarian New Founding Fathers need this first purge to be a success, so when the brown and poverty stricken residents of Staten Island don't riot and kill, they send in a Blackwater type of group to make sure there are plenty of killings in hopes of turning citizens against one another. When the leader of the Blackwater group is a dead ringer or Ronny Regan, it's not hard to guess where this film's politics lie and the filmmakers opinion of our current president and his divisive style of politics for personal enrichment (At one point, the heroine refers to one of her attackers as a ""pussy-grabber,"" a pretty direct Trump reference.). As with the other films, this one follows a disparate group of folks trying to survive the 12-hour Purge, primarily an anti-purge activist and a community minded drug kingpin. The downside to this film is similar to the others, in that there is not a lot of character development and despite a strong film concept and story set-up, the film quickly devolves into a series of action set pieces. I found this to be the weakest of the series when it came to action and suspense, but it's likely the strongest when it comes to better fleshing out the politics and the logic behind the purge. I'm also disappointed that the series is straying pretty significantly from it's horror roots in the first film and is more and more becoming an urban action film series. The first two films did an excellent job of conveying the frightening anarchy of the purge (the first film was a straight-up horror home invasion story), but subsequent films has felt more action oriented. I much preferred the uncompromising horror of the first films, which seemed to delve more into the darkness of human nature, even if the logic of the purge was less intelligible. Series creator James DeMonaco is only the writer this time and leaves the directing duties to Gerard McMurray, who does a serviceable job, but this film felt less apocalyptic and less surreal than the prior films, somewhat to it's detriment. After having watched this film and having started watching the 10 episode TV event, I think The Purge series needs to either become more political (which this film did more so) or more focused on simply presenting interesting scenarios and chaos (which the TV show is doing more of), but I keep feeling like there's not enough of either in any of these films.",/review/rw4857355/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2018,dimidrol14,1," Race baiting and politically biased
","Whereas movie starts off with pointing out real issues of low class neighborhoods concerning unemployment, gang and drug activities, focusing on a young man and his sister, trying to survive and not fall into these issues, the focus quickly shifts to feelings of grievances and victimhood. The main point of the movie becomes a sort of a standoff between oppressors and the oppressed. The race takes center stage and all points I thought the movie tried to touch in the beginning and make a viewer care, vanish and become just another one sided rhetoric",/review/rw4857355/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie was useless, and made to milk the cow once more.",/review/rw4857355/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2018,kjproulx,2," A Beyond Lacklustre Prequel
","I'm not a big horror fan, but I always appreciate when a great horror flick comes along. When The Purge was released back in 2013, I was very underwhelmed by it, as the premise itself intrigued me enough to warrant a viewing. The biggest issue I had with that film is that it was a country-wide event that was self-contained in one house. When the second film came along I was inclined to give it a chance because it did what I hoped the first film was going to. Now, this franchise has gone n for far too long and we have arrived at a prequel in The First Purge. The idea of going back to the very first purge has potential, but this film lives up to nothing of the sort. Anything good to speak of this franchise has now been killed in my eyes. This is easily the worst film in the franchise and one of the worst films I've seen in 2018, period.",/review/rw4857355/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2019,talbus-93026,1," Boring, Race-baiting, Dumpster Fire
","The first couple of Purge movies were okay, but this one is just God awful. The whole narrative isn't even about The Purge, it just becomes an ""Us vs. Them"" story where it's basically black people vs. white people/the government. The bad guys toward the end become white people, literally dressed in KKK robes (in NYC I believe, which would never happen in the first place) that are being paid by the government to kill black people. Then on top of it all, they make the rich drug dealer kingpin and his gang out to be the heroes of the whole story who saves the black community. Yeah, great message. This story is terrible and sends an awful message meant to incite hate and racism. To finish off my review, ignoring everything I just said... it's super f*cling boring. I had a hard time staying awake through the whole thing. Don't waste your time with this one.",/review/rw4857355/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2020,mjanssens26,1," Horrible, racist garbage
",In the movie all white people are bad and black people are incapable of success unless they deal drugs and the rest need to survive on government handouts that are only paid to them if they commit crimes. Racist trash! Just about insulting to everyone. The film makers should be ashamed of themselves. Thankfully there are smart film makers who show many different diverse cast members in movies where they portray successful and inspiring characters,/review/rw4857355/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2021,aidanratesmovies,1," Sigh...what a waste of potential
","It's a dreadful bore, with poor writing, and an incredibly forced depiction of the Black side of this fictional movement. Everything the film tries to start anew feels so out of place and none of it amounts to anything remotely interesting, while everything else feels like a forced tie in product to the other films before it, never directly addressing them, but largely relying on similar setups and situations that the other ones have already dealt with. The acting is incredibly over the top, the screenplay even more so, never knowing what it quite wants to be or wants to say. The direction is harsh, the tone and look of the film bleak, and it never decides on whether it wants to be a trip to empowerment or a social commentary, both of which the film pulls off poorly. The music is forced, the characters thin, and I can't think of many things positive about the film besides potential that the film so poorly executed. In the end, The First Purge is not only a pointless sequel, but a truly lackluster film, with no agenda but to accumulate some more money for this seemingly never ending franchise.

19 August 2019,JeanDeMichaque,1," Utterly ridiculous
","I m writing this review while the movie is still on. This is by far the worst Purge movie. Acting, plot, dialogues everything is just horrible. I hope everyone dies at the end, only this would make the movie deserve more than one star :P",/review/rw4857355/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2020,Leofwine_draca,4," A painful way to spend your time
","THE FIRST PURGE is a prequel to the popular trilogy that they really shouldn't have bothered with. As a prequel it's not of interest at all, because it doesn't add anything different other than having a new group of characters going through that lawless night. Bizarrely, this one turns out to be a blaxploitation feeling movie, with street gangs and psychos all over the place. The problem with it is that the writing is severely lacking, failing to offer the audience any likeable or identifiable characters throughout. There are a few good action scenes but generally this is a painful way to spend your time.",/review/rw4857355/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2018,wendalena,1," Awful movie
","Loved the original Purge movie, but this one was just so horrible. Seriously... the big neighborhood drug dealer is the good guy hero (""Make way for the King!"") and all the white people are bad & evil. I kept hoping I was wrong, but it just kept getting more and more obvious. What's the message here? Just a movie to feed the racial divide with stereotypes all over the place. Incredibly disappointing.",/review/rw4857355/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2018,amufan,2," The original Purge was such Unique thriller....how did they let it become so bad...
","Yes the original movie had a small political point of view but it was not the main plot line, it was the question of the purge itself, it actually made you think about what iff.... Also the original had no racial bias, it took place in a wealthy neighbor hood with multiple races and in fact the white family and black homeless man worked together to fend off the interracial mix of wealthy homeowners. It did a great job of not letting those issues that seem to plague so many movies and focus on its task, presenting a new and unique plot line that was suspenseful and very entertaining. 
The 2nd purge attempted to expand beyond one family in one neighborhood and begin to touch the moral question and what the real purpose of the concept of the purge was, to try and eliminate the lower class and anyone that were deemed a leech on society, again doing an excellent job. It did not make it a race issue, because contrary to what many politicians will tell you is there are poor people across all races, it is NOT just a black issue....you see poverty is colored blind! The third movie did its best to keep it non racial, but in the end failed miserably. 
Now we come to this movie, I don't leave movies early, and 3/4 of the way through I thought ok there is a racial undertone but not so bad I can't ignore it. Then like the 3rd movie only to an new level, this movie turned completely, 100% about white vs black, I had to leave... Shame on Blumhouse for backing this movie and completely ruining the Purge series. I see why James DeMonaco did not want to direct this tired old Hollywood political trash!",/review/rw4857355/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2018,rjw999,1," Embarrassingly BAD
","I was embarrassed sitting in the theatre. I eventually had enough and walked out! Worst movie of the year. The only positive thing is that, after I tuned it out, I had time to think about the TRASH Hollywood turns out. And I resolved to go to much less movies and be more discerning about the movies I go to. So I'm grateful I will stop seeing these random garbage movies and save some money.

24 July 2021,VanillaSkunk,3," Worst Purge movie out of all of them
","The characters are underdeveloped and the acting is bad, which made me indifferent whether they survived or not. There is no real suspense, only random action scenes.

18 October 2018,kosmasp,6," Political divide
","If you actually think this movie will divide America further ... I've got news for you: that's not possible. Was I surprised how much they packed in, when it comes to political references and hints and messages (not even really hidden ones) to the current state? You better believe that I was. I did think that it might hurt the movie because people do try to escape when watching a movie not really wanting to see something they see on their news channel all day anyway.",/review/rw4857355/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2019,Platypuschow,4," The First Purge: The First Purge is the worst Purge
","I've said since day one that The Purge is an incredible concept which positively reeks of potential.

9 August 2018,TheLittleSongbird,1," The tired and pointless purge
","Disked 'The Purge', apart from the reasonable two leads and a nice gritty look it was tired, poorly written, cheesy, tension and suspense free with annoying characters. Sort of liked 'The Purge: Anarchy', while finding it flawed in especially the writing Frank Grillo's presence livened things up a lot. Had mixed feelings on 'The Purge: Election Year', it had its moments (again Grillo and the committed cast) but the writing, uneven story and characters sunk it.",/review/rw4857355/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2018,matthewkushner35,1," Absolute Garbage.
","My expectations going into be movie were impeccably low, however, apparently, they were not low enough. Do not go into this movie expecting a thorough back story to the beginnings of the purge. Instead, expect a very short glimpse of the beginnings, which is followed by simply another purge movie, that is just worse. I debated leaving halfway through, but I remembered I payed 6 dollars to watch it, and I went with 2 other people. Please save your money, and don't go or rent this trash.",/review/rw4857355/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2018,pcytoman,5," Had Potential, Falls short
","Being a fan of the Purge movies, I felt this movie fell short of my expectations.
The other Purge movies had political and social commentaries without being too overly blatant. The First Purge is just too obvious and dumb. To have militias dressed up as Klan members and Nazis is just almost bordering on parody. There were mixed social messages . For example , a drug dealer , who destroys his community and purges his competition , becomes the hero? ",/review/rw4857355/?ref_=tt_urv

","Face it, all the purge movies since the original have been bad. This is downright awful and insulting. Too many cliches. Black vs White. KKK looking killers. Hell, there's even Nazi looking gear.

1 October 2018,SnoopyStyle,7," intriguing origin story
","The American economy has crashed. The political system is in turmoil. The two party system has fallen and the New Founding Fathers of America has been elected. Dr. May Updale is The Architect of the First Purge and Staten Island has been selected for the experiment. Locals are given $5000 each to participate. At first, most would rather throw big street parties or hide behind locked doors. Individual attacks soon becomes widespread as bigger powers aim to use the purge for their own purposes.",/review/rw4857355/?ref_=tt_urv
