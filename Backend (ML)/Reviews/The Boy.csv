","I must admit, going into this film, I was rather excited; I've enjoyed both of David Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen's previous collaborations and my interest in both Freudian psychology/psychoanalysis and Michael Fassbender practically guaranteed that I would be seeing this film.

24 November 2011,Chris_Pandolfi,8," When Talking Was Experimental
","Sabina Spielrein was one of the first female psychoanalysts, a fascinating achievement given the fact that she was committed to a mental institution for an entire year. After studying medicine and child psychology in Zurich, graduating in 1911, and getting elected into the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, she proposed an idea in 1912, namely that the human sexual drive contained both an instinct of destruction and an instinct of transformation. Her death in 1942 at the hands of an SS death squad would all but erase her from the history books until her hospital records, journal entries, and letters to and from Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud were discovered and published; it's now widely accepted within psychiatric circles that her 1912 proposal greatly influenced the works of both men.",/review/rw2520794/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2012,DICK STEEL,8," A Nutshell Review: A Dangerous Method
","A Dangerous Method marks the third film that director David Cronenberg had collaborated with actor Viggo Mortensen, casting him as the famed Sigmund Freud in a tale that examines the relationship between three prominent scientists in the early days of psycho-analysis, with the other two being Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) and Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), set in the early 1900s, adapting from the play The Talking Cure by Christopher Hampton, which in turn was based on the non fiction book A Most Dangerous Method by John Kerr.

31 October 2011,yris2002,7," Rather flat and encyclopedic
","I really expected more by this movie, I expected more pathos, but unfortunately it proved scarcely involving and too rational. Nothing to say against the perfect technical execution, and the good acting, but what is disappointing is the screenplay, which should have been, in my opinion, the most significant element of the picture. Dialogues are flat, too rationally aimed at conveying an encyclopedic definition of psychoanalysis, but incapable of conveying empathy towards any of the three main characters, Jung, Freud and Sabine Spielrein. In the end we do not get the depth of each character, and the subtlety of their relationship. Keira Knightely 's character is overacted, excessive,but in the end underdeveloped, just the prototype of a pathologically insane. Freud appears a weird old man, only caring for what the scientific community might think, but not as daring as we think he might have been, Jung is a pathetic unfaithful man, but with an inner fragility we cannot perceive fully. And the complexity of the relation analyst-patient as well as master-disciple never comes out. It's a movie that seems to promise plenty, seems to be always on the verge of revealing something, but never takes off, as if the director wanted to keep a distance from the handled subject, as if afraid of being swept away by the abyss of the human complex mind. Or maybe because the complexity is too great to be thoroughly revealed? maybe, but being this the reason, the result remains unconvincing.",/review/rw2520794/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2012,Rockwell_Cronenberg,5," Frustratingly pedestrian.
","As a long admirer of David Cronenberg, I eagerly await each of his new films as if I am a young child on Christmas Eve. When announced that his new film, A Dangerous Method, had him working with Michael Fassbender and (for a third time) Viggo Mortensen, two of my favorite actors, as well as Keira Knightley and Vincent Cassel, I thought I must have been dreaming. Adding on that the film was going to be an exploration into the relationship between Carl Jung (portrayed by Fassbender) and Sigmund Freud (Mortensen), the gods of psychoanalysis, and this had the makings for Cronenberg's masterpiece. So one can only begin to imagine my dismay when, after a promising first act, A Dangerous Method turned out to be the most inordinately tame and pedestrian Cronenberg film in over thirty years.",/review/rw2520794/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2012,Boba_Fett1138,6," The movie does a good job....at telling you absolutely nothing!
","A movie about Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud directed by David Cronenberg? That sounds surprising and interesting, to say the very least but the movie as it turned out, was far from anything interesting to watch.",/review/rw2520794/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2012,KineticSeoul,8," This movie is far from being a let down
","Now I enjoyed Cronenberg's previous film ""Eastern Promises"" so I really looked forward to his latest work. Past ""Cronenberg"" films has psychological aspect to it, but this deals with some well known psychologist and the relationship between them which intrigued me even more. I thought this movie would revolve around the notorious psychologist Sigmund Freud who is the founder of psychoanalysis. But it revolves more around Carl Jung who is the founder of analytical psychology and his relationship with Sabina Spielrein, Sigmund Freud and Otto Gross. It was just interesting and engaging to watch these three well known psychologist that are interested in the human mind build relationships through what their main interest is. But if your looking for a detailed explanation of how some of them got to the point of there views on the human mind, you might be disappointed. It just shows bits and pieces of how Carl Jung and Sabina Spielrein got to their views on the human mind. Carl Jung in this movie is portrayed as a character that acts righteous but does some hypocritical things. And Sigmund Freud is portrayed as someone that is very pedantic and egotistical about his theories of the human mind. So their approach is different in some areas. Carl Jung cadillac exterior phenomenon and deals with some spiritual aspects. But Sigmund Freud doesn't deal very well with sanctimonious Keira Knightley plays Sabina Spielrein, now some may agree or disagree but she had this theory of destruction and self destruction and how true sexuality comes from the destruction of the ego. I agree that Keira does seem to over act when trying to play crazy but when she becomes more calmer in this movie her acting really starts to shine. Michael Fassbender is good as Carl Jung and did a good job portraying his character that is infatuated with the human mind but also acts a bit naive sometimes. While Carl Jung is on his road to his discoveries, Sigmund Freud played by Viggo Mortensen is the scene stealer in this movie cause his acting is spot on. Proving he is a underrated versatile actor. Overall this is a intriguing movie that is worth seeing at least once, wasn't groundbreaking but it's a good movie that is more than just a love hate relationships kinda deal.",/review/rw2520794/?ref_=tt_urv

27 November 2011,MaxBorg89,7," Method and Madness
","Given his entire filmography is concerned with themes linked to man's identity and the complexities of human sexuality, David Cronenberg is, on paper at least, the ideal director for A Dangerous Method, a movie dealing with the birth of psychoanalysis. Then again, the film is also a bit of an odd fit for him, since the script by Christopher Hampton (Dangerous Liaisons) doesn't really lend itself to the outbursts of graphic violence that permeate the Canadian auteur's body of work. The result, first witnessed at the Venice Film Festival (after the film had allegedly been rejected by Cronenberg's fest of choice, Cannes), is an interesting but somewhat hollow entry in the director's admirable career.",/review/rw2520794/?ref_=tt_urv

","Have you ever witness a hysterical person having a crisis? I haven't, probably neither have you. Could that be the reason why to some reviewers (including myself) the histrionics of Keira Knightley as a hysterical patient were embarrassing to watch on the screen? I don' know. Probably real hysteria looks like that but in daily life a witness won't feel what a film viewer feels when being forced to watch incessantly all those facial and body contortions on close ups.",/review/rw2520794/?ref_=tt_urv

18 December 2012,georgemilojevic,6," a great idea. idea.
","This started very well, great cast, landscapes, scenography, characters etc. I loved the idea of to greatest psychology minds working together on improving therapy methods and changing the approach to curing people of their traumas and problems. Where i find the movie failed a bit is the story where the connections in the scenes are bit off. I got the feeling that it was jumping trough periods without any connection which i could put together. It seemed like there were years in gaps between couple of scenes where there wasn't any. Even if this followed only true life events of Jung and Freud it still leaves us with wanting more then just few dialogs and scratch on the surface of psychology treatments. Kinsey (2004) is a movie which is a good parallel example how a movie about similar subject can be and can be done brilliantly. Maybe movies about lives of both Jung and Freud are in order. So, all in all, i enjoyed watching it, everyone did a great job and gives you a good feeling after, it has minor gaps in the story which doesn't make you stick to the chair but definitely recommend it to everyone.",/review/rw2520794/?ref_=tt_urv

","David Cronenberg was my main reason for seeing 'A Dangerous Method'. While not one of my all time favourite directors, he is a very unique and truly admirable one and find a good deal to like about all his films, even the ones that don't do a lot for me overall.

",It's 1904. Hysterical Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley) is sent to Dr. Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) in Zurich for treatment. She has psychological sexual problems based on her violent father. He has a cold clinical relationship with his wife Emma (Sarah Gadon). The older Dr. Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) is the elder statesman to Jung but he's starting to chaff at the paternal relationship. Freud sends a new patient Otto Gross (Vincent Cassel) to Jung.

","I'm not particularly interested in Jung or Freud (although I have been to the Freud house in Vienna). I'm not a particular fan of any of the actors in this film. I am definitely not a Cronenburg fan. If I had known this was a Cronenburg film, I probably wouldn't have gone. ",/review/rw2520794/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2012,SteveMierzejewski,8," A film that's as good as you make it
","After reading the summary of this film, there was one thing that worried me about watching it. That was Keira Knightley. I know I'm in the minority here but, in my opinion, she has a tendency to overact, and when I can tell someone is acting, I'm unable to enjoy the movie, simply because the whole point of watching any movie is to enter into an alternate reality. Bad acting or overacting is probably the best way to kill the idea that such an alternative reality is possible. Reading the summary, and reading that Knightley was playing a hysterical woman, made me consider whether I should waste my time on this film. Now, I can't say that she didn't have her overacting moments, she did; however, she was believable enough and good enough to keep me involved. It should be said that this would be a difficult role for anyone to play. The other members of the cast, Michael Fassenbender and Viggo Mortensen, were well-suited to their roles of Jung and Freud, respectively. If I had one problem with the cast, it was with Sarah Gadon, who played Jung's wife. It was not her acting. She was, quite frankly, too attractive.

19 October 2011,francescof86,8," ""A dangerous method""
","It's always difficult to review a movie based on psychology because sometimes what's difficult to understand is too easily categorized as illogical or bad execution.I heard so much criticism towards the last movie by Cronenberg.I completely disagree with those bad reactions.""A dangerous method""is a brilliant ,absorbing and thought provoking movie that boasts excellent performances by the three leading actors.The direction is great and Cronenberg once again shows his uncommon ability to tell a story in a very original way although the dialogs are sometimes hard to follow,probably due to its subject.But there are really breathtaking moments such as the scenes of the Spielrein therapy.This leads me to Knightley performance.It was a brave,shocking and terrific performance that it was criticized without a reason.I didn't catch all that hatred.She has always been so good(""Pride e prejudice"",""Atonement"" and ""Never let me go"")but here she left her comfort zone to bare herself and gives one of the most exiting performances of the year.Oscar worthy material.Fassbender was equally great in the role of Jung and it's a pleasure to watch this splendid rising A-list actor.Mortensen was good but I fear not as good as Fassbender and Knightley.Cassell is always Cassell.He's a good actor but he plays always the role of the daring man.I think that ""A dangerous method"" is one of the best movies of the year.It succeeds to transcend from his particular story to focus on the hidden instincts associated with the human nature.My vote is 8/10.",/review/rw2520794/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2017,leplatypus,10," For one time, Freud was right (web)
","Personnaly, i'm rather Jungian than Freudian because Jung dazzles me with his collective unconscious, mythical knowledge while Freud links all problems to sex. This enlarged scope versus this limited scope is indeed talked in the movie. So far i didn't know that the two worked together and their meting was really interesting to follow. So it was rather a disappointment to learn that their break-up was due essentially about a woman whom Jungs likes to whip ass! It's not the first time (and surely not the last) when a great mind fails stature and private life reveals a much darker person. Anyway this movie has an incredible fantastic four cast: Fassbender is always this deep inside treacherous man, Mortensen shows his natural authority and his ability with cigars, Cassel, despite his beard, looks very much like his late father and his french appetite is true and for sure, Keira has one of her best part ever: always sweet with past fashion, she shows one more time her determination as well her inner weakness as she punches herself into madness! Cronenberg is inspired with his camera and offers us one of his best movies since a lot of years! NB: Jung's study of UFO was amazing to help me grasp that my love for space is a crutch to support me against my fear of death as the two are similar ... As Captain Kirk says Space (death) is the final frontier ... where no man has gone before.",/review/rw2520794/?ref_=tt_urv

29 February 2012,estebangonzalez10,5," Not what I was expecting
","¨Experiences like this, however painful, unnecessary and inevitable, without them, how can we know life? ¨ David Cronenberg's A Dangerous Method was one of my most anticipated films of 2011 for several reasons: First of all I loved Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen's first two collaborations together in A History of Violence and Eastern Promises. Those two films were among my favorite when they were released. Mortensen has always worked really well with Cronenberg and I had high expectations for his role as Sigmund Freud in this film. Add Micheal Fassbender, who has turned everything he touches into gold this year; to the mix and you have yourself one of the most anticipated films of the year. I was really looking forward to what these three men could do together alongside the beautiful Keira Knightley. I'm not familiar with psychoanalysis, but I do tend to enjoy the subject matter somewhat so I was really looking forward to this movie. Perhaps those high expectations were my downfall because this was a completely different movie from the previous two that Cronenberg had directed. This was more focused on the dialogue and relationship between the characters. This isn't an action film with shocking scenes; it is more of a reflective film that analyzes the relationship between Freud, Jung, and Spielrein. I just felt the pace of the movie was too slow and that there wasn't enough time between the transitions to further develop each character and their relationship together. I felt like I had seen an incomplete film, or that several scenes were missing. The film focuses more on the relationship between Jung and his Russian patient Spielrein, and not so much on Freud, so that was something else I wish would've been different.",/review/rw2520794/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2011,MovieGeekBlog,5," Riddled in clichés and boring
","I can't remember the last time when I have been so much in disagreement with the general critical response for a movie Everywhere I look I seem to hear and read high praises for Cronenberg's latest work, and yet I am willing to bet that few of those who claimed to like it so much would be ready to watch it again. As far as I am concerned I am struggling to find something positive to say (well, yes, nice costumes) and the only reason why my vote isn't any lower is because I am willing to admit that I might have not been in the right mood for it. Even in his most flawed films, Cronenberg has always been an interesting director, or at least able to create not only an almost palpable atmosphere, but also a particularly defined style and vision which set him apart from the usual Hollywood crowd. And yet this one seems a film with no direction whatsoever. Not only each sequence felt random and inconsequential as if not necessarily edited in the right order, without any real feeling of natural progression from the previous one into the next, but also it was all so static and lifeless that sometimes I even wondered whether anyone was actually directing at all. At no point I felt any sympathy for any of the character: in fact, not only I did not like any of them, but I didn't even hate them either. I just didn't care. And this is is a rather strange thing to say, because on paper, a film about the relationship between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud (and consequently the birth of psychoanalysis) sounded to me very intriguing indeed. Sadly, pretty earlier on into ""A dangerous Method"" I realised that this wasn't really the type of film I was hoping to see. I found myself uneasy right from the word ""go"", that is from the moment I saw Keira Knightley overacting like never before and stretching her chin to new unbelievable levels, as if screaming to the audience ""I want that Oscar!!"". Well, darling, not this time. Then, after the early screams, it all calmed down a bit and the dialogue started and that's when it got worse! For a film which should rely on words more than action itself (especially given the static nature of it all), I found the script absolutely puerile. It all felt like it was written by a high school kid, who's just heard a few things about Freud and wants to impress his friend with his newly acquired knowledge. I mean, there are actually lines like ""You Freud, have always sex in your mind. Why does everything always has to do with sex?""! Really? Mr Hampton, who are you writing this script for? Surely your target audience doesn't need things spell out so boldly and blatantly. It was like reading a checklist of all the possible clichés one could think about psychoanalysis (and Freud in particular). Who is this film for anyway? At times it felt like it was so ridiculously basic, as if it was written for people who have never even heard of Freud and Jung. Other times it was all so riddled with heavy handed quotes and so ""up its own self"" that it felt like watching some boring lecture given by an even more bored teacher, sitting on your old desk back in school. From such a renowned scriptwriter (he wrote Dangerous Liaisons and Atonement among the other things) I was expecting a lot more: maybe Mr Hampton should watch a few episodes of HBO's classy ""In Treatment"" to learn a thing of two about the subtlety of bringing psychoanalysis to the screen. As far as the two leading male actors (Fassbender and Mortensen, who by the way was so good in both Cronenberg ""A History of Violence"" and ""Eastern Promises""), they were as good as they could possibly be, but in the end they both failed to impress, move, or even raise any sort of emotion beyond boredom. But then again, that's hardly surprising given both the script they were actually given and a clear lack of any direction, which forced them to talk at each other in the most contrived scenes and badly staged, where even the extras in the background seemed fake and moved slowly and gently like ermwell, extras (particularly noticeable in the scene by the river).
