14 October 2002,jessied,," light review of weighty material
","The white oleander looks beautiful but its poison kills.  Social service agencies take children from their abusive parents but place them in homes and institutions where violence reigns.  Ingrid Magnussen (Michelle Pfeiffer) puts her daughter, Astrid (Alison Lohman), in the center of her artwork but pushes her to the perimeter of her reality.  Life is a contradiction in which nothing is purely good or purely evil.",/review/rw2935543/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2002,Rogue-32,8," Ingrid and Astrid work it out
","Although not a perfect film by any stretch (too many things happen without any seeming rationale behind them and some of the most important plot points are too vague), White Oleander still kept me intrigued, thanks mainly to the great performances by Pfeiffer (extraordinary in her restraint - brilliant characterization), Renee Zellweiger (achingly vulnerable here) and the extremely talented Alison Lohman (who's in nearly every scene and never hits a false note - and the fact that she sort of looks like Kirsten Dunst doesn't hurt either).

13 October 2002,janefondafan,10," extremely powerful film
","First of all, those guys out there who see the posters and advertising and assume this is some sappy chick flick, you couldn't be more wrong.  What it is, is an extraordinarily moving piece of work.  It's the kind of film that hits you right in the pit of your stomach.  Personally, my mind has a tendancy to wander during movies, but with this one, I was glued to it right from the first frame to the last.  It's been awhile since I found myself so touched by a movie.. and it reminds me of why I love movies in the first place.  The performances here are top notch.  Alison Lohman (Astrid), I never even heard of her before going to see this... but she tackles this difficult role like she has the experience of an award-winning veteran. I'm not even sure most of the big names could pull off this role like she did. Michelle Pfeiffer (Ingrid), who I was never a big fan of, is also excellent...she has a character who's so beautiful, yet so repulsive at the same time.  The mother/daughter relationship her character has with Alison's is probably the most unconventional i've seen in a film, and that's what makes it so compelling.  Renee Zellweger, as Clare, also gives her best performance here.  Her relationship with Astrid is a beautiful but ultimately a tragedy one, mainly due to Clare's infatuation with her cheating husband Mark (Noah Wyle), but I won't give it away of course! ;)",/review/rw2935543/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2002,jdesando,," It's been a while since I've seen as good a job at depicting the effects of a strong but flawed mother on her strong but impressionable daughter.
","""White Oleander,"" adapted from Janet Fitch's best-selling novel, is hard and edgy about the bond between single mother and daughter, letting us see the reality of a strong artistic mother (Michelle Pfeiffer) tyrannizing her gifted daughter (Alison Lohman). After murdering her lover, mom goes to prison and daughter goes on an odyssey of self discovery in foster families, reminiscent of Burt Lancaster's episodic journey in John  Cheever's `The Swimmer.'",/review/rw2935543/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2002,ferguson-6,8," Pfabulous Pfeiffer
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Based on the terrific novel of the same name, director Peter Kosminsky's film version of ""White Oleander"" is quite powerful, yet at times, hollow and choppy.  Due to the intricate details of the book, this is somewhat expected, however, as filmgoers, we do not get the full impact of the three years in Astrid's life.  Stunning performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and Alison Lohman give the film its power.  Their scenes together are as painful for us as for them.  Pfeiffer, the most beautiful convict one will ever encounter, shoots a couple of ""evil eyes"" that are pure genius.  She is truly a cobra - don't get too close.  I really think Alison Lohman's performance is one of the best I have seen in a while. Touching, heart-breaking, independent, distant and loving, she longs for someone to trust.  When she does find her soul mate, she fights the urge, assuming they will somehow disappoint each other.  The movie is told through the episodes of each of her foster homes and her struggles to make them work. Robin Wright (""The Princess Bride"") plays a sexy, desparate born-again Christian, who mistrusts Astrid, but needs the state funds.  Rene Zellweger is fantastic as the broken, no self esteem, wanna-be actress who is desperate for companionship and finds it in Astrid.  This is another of Astrids heartbreaking relationships and nearly turns her against the world. Patrick Fugit (""Almost Famous"") offers a nice turn as the one who provides the out for Astrid.  Subtlety abounds in his performance.  Don't miss Billy Connally as the recepient of the flower in the title.  Keep an eye out for future films with Alison Lohman - she shows much of the fine acting abilities of Jena Malone.  These two should be fun to watch for years.",/review/rw2935543/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2003,mrwinch,10," White Oleander - I got it - brilliant
","With no expectations of anything beyond the average I was aware as I viewed this film that it was a quality beyond most mainstream films currently available. We all left fairly stunned and stumbling into the daylight at the conclusion.  Slowly devastatingly and utterly integral, at no point was the audience's intelligence insulted, the depth of characters, plot and script evenly executed with no room for anything but knowing we the audience were in for something special. Don't expect any black and white conclusions or answers, just the complexities of dynamics between kin and otherwise. . . brilliantly cast. I hope Michelle Pfieffer earns her first oscar here . . . comparable to American Beauty, I don't know why - but as poignant, beautiful, truthful and important.  Beautiful soundtrack and to look at, pace perfect.",/review/rw2935543/?ref_=tt_urv

17 March 2003,Puppet_Master,8," Superb film version of a fine novel
","Strong performances by Lohman, Penn, Zellweger and especially Michelle Pfeiffer in a faithful adaptation of Janet Fitch's novel. Not hard to see why this one didn't attract more attention in theaters, since it lacks the ingredients that seem to characterize hit films nowadays -- such as action, violence, sex and stunning special effects. It's just a very moving story, well-crafted and well-acted. I'd recommend it to anyone.",/review/rw2935543/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2006,Flagrant-Baronessa,7," Alison Lohman stands out in subtle coming-of-age drama
","Based on the same-titled novel by Janet Fitch, White Oleander tells the story of a teenage girl (Alison Lohman) struggling to survive in foster homes while her free-spirited mother (Michelle Phieffer) is in prison for having murdered her lover with the poisonous flower 'White Oleander'. It is a complex story of the relationship between a powerless girl and a loveless mother that, in spite of its cheesy sounding premise, manages to avoid all clichéd Hallmark moments and project quite a lot of heart in doing so.",/review/rw2935543/?ref_=tt_urv

","A girl born without a father and raised by a mother who is a real Machiavelli of love, has one day to face her own life through hell when her mother is sent to prison for the murder of her boy friend because he had to let her go on their last meeting because he had a date, which she of course could not accept. The girl knows all the horror there can be in the kind of institution she finds herself sent to or in the foster homes she ends up in. She is nothing but a substitute for something the foster parents do not have, or the dream that her presence is going to solve their own problems, or whatever. But the worst part is of course her mother who is, from behind the wings, pulling the strings that pretend to protect the girl whereas she is only treating her as a possession that has to be defended for future use. She thus more or less creates temptation or even death in those foster homes that could have helped her daughter. When this daughter finally realizes her mother's game it is by far too late and she can only sever the tie, the connection, the link, the bond. And it is then that she builds a compensation and pretends she finally understands that her mother loved her. When it becomes obvious the mother will not be granted an appeal or win the one she may be granted and that she will not be granted parole the daughter has to more or less make it sound as if she were responsible for her mother's crime, her mother's destitution and even her mother's continuing ordeal she deserves quite a lot. Such mothers are puppeteers with their children, daughters, and they turn their daughters into musketeers who are fighting with their own reflection in a mirror, with their own shadows, when it is not with their own mothers' shadows.",/review/rw2935543/?ref_=tt_urv

1 August 2005,dumbblonde416,10," Very emotional and moving
","This was an excellent movie, very emotional and moving.Michelle Pfeiffer looks more like she belongs in a beauty contest than in prison. She still did a good job with Ingrid, though. But it was Renee Zellweger who steals the show with her portrayal of Claire Richards, the suicidal foster mother. This is such a different role for her. It shows that she can act in dramas just as well as in comedies and thrillers. Allison Lohmann was very convincing in her role of Astrid, which I think this is her first big film.This is an excellent movie, but it is more of a chick flick than an 'everybody' movie. Also, don't watch this movie if you are in the mood to be cheered up lol, as although this is a great movie it is not a very happy one :)",/review/rw2935543/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2006,Sherazade,10," Cinematically Excellent!
","Michelle Pfeifer sizzles as Ingrid, a hard-to-put-into-a-single-sentence type woman raising her daughter Astrid alone in Los Angeles, when the world as they know it is forever obstructed as love-in-disguise walks in. This obstruction is not Ingrid's manners, mannerisms, insanity nor is it the jail sentence she gets for murder, the obstruction in question here is her lover, played annoyingly perfect by Billy Connolly, and let me just say that for the life of me, I don't know when she fell for him. She was perfect without him. While she is in jail, Ingrid's character revisits us once more in the outside world in form of the lovely Renee Zellwegger but at least we see why ""she"" fell for Noah Wyle (who plays her actor husband). Anyways, The film is about Ingrid's relationship with her daughter Astrid and how Astrid's life changes from age 12 through 20 while her mother is in jail. The actress who plays Astrid is phenomenal in this role and Pfeiffer is incredibly accolade worthy as fiery Ingrid, the true white oleander! Two very enthusiastic thumbs up! :D",/review/rw2935543/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2003,secordman,," If you enjoyed the book, look out.
","White Oleander was a great book, but there are a few nagging omissions in the movie.  For some reason, Michelle Pfeiffer is an artist and not a poet in the movie (was the focus group confused?)  Noah Wyle's character's name changed from Ron to Mark for some unknown reason.",/review/rw2935543/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2004,au_law2001,10," White is a clear color, and it's hard to tell what's in it.
","When I first saw commercials and trailers for this, I thought this was going to be a suspense thriller because it has something to do with murder, and such a classic type of murder too. Unexpected. But as I watched it, it proved me wrong, especially the intro of it, but when I first saw it, I didn't know that was it, the movie I saw in the commercial, and it surprised me! This is what made me want to sit to watch this movie. It is basically a young woman who is arrested, and her daughter has to move form home to home, and visits her mother in prison, telling her the experiences she had, in which her mother contradicts, and as she continues her mother still says how she should really be instead of following what she has learned: love, friendship, belief in God, and as she hears this, she realizes her mother won't let her go, all she ever says are things that describes herself and not anyone else. So she decides to tell her what love really is, and find out about this guy she was involved with. It is typically about a disillusioned mother who has become cynical about the outside world after she's been heart broken, and now is brought to prison after she murders the one who wronged her, and her daughter has to be somewhere else. I really enjoyed it, and it did made me feel a bit sad, and made me sympathize the characters in it, I recommend it to fans of Michelle Pfeiffer and those who enjoy dramas, and those who find other soaps tedious, this is for you, as for me, I give it an excellent 10! Renee Zellweger is in this too, be sure to spot her.",/review/rw2935543/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2006,paul2001sw-1,6," Astrid weeps!
","There are lots of interesting ideas in 'White Oleander', a film about a girl (Astrid) trying to make her way through California's child support system after her brilliant but overpowering mother is imprisoned. There'as also a fine performance from Michelle Pfeiffer as the mother, who conveys a hint a madness each time she rolls her eyes about her feline face. But it's a pity a lot of the execution is so unsubtle. The mother's crime, for example, is murder; while in foster care the girl first finds a foster-mum who tries to kill her, and then one who succeeds in killing herself. Each of these events are plausible in themselves, but not altogether, and tragedy does not require death on this scale. While the initially clever way the film starts to divert our sympathy away from the mother becomes increasingly obvious, and slightly dishonest when it undermines the idea originally conveyed that mother and daughter had been close. The film also suffers from a slight overdose of Hollywood gloss: everyone is beautiful, everyone is talented, in part this is justified by the plot but one sometimes despairs of ever seeing someone normal-looking in a leading movie role. These flaws mean that 'White Oleander' is far from a great film; but its ambition (to explore complexity in human relationships) keeps it interesting, even if its realisation doesn't quite deliver the potential of its ideas.",/review/rw2935543/?ref_=tt_urv

","As with most films based on best-selling books, many viewers make the hollow complaint ""the book was much better"", not conscious of the fact that in reading a book you are making the movie in your mind, and everyone's ""movie"" is different. Getting past that, WHITE OLEANDER, the film, is a very good one.  Although, the subject matter, a young girl being forced to grow up in foster homes with different, dysfunctional families, is not a very pretty one. It does require us to examine our own lives and compare them.",/review/rw2935543/?ref_=tt_urv

","The long, arduous journey of a teenage girl in Los Angeles, left without a legal guardian after her single mom is convicted of killing her boyfriend and is sent to prison for 35 years. Intense, powerful adaptation of Janet Fitch's 1999 bestseller, with a superb central performance by Alison Lohman as Astrid, daughter of the convicted artist, her mother, who claims to have raised her child as a strong, willful, independent girl--or is that just how the mother sees herself? Lohman's fragile character amusingly assimilates her own personality to each new foster family she goes to stay with--three in three years--hardening her heart along the way, but expanding her awareness of the secret early turbulence she endured at the hands of her mother, the poisonous white oleander. Mary Agnes Donoghue's screenplay, while patchy in spots (particularly in regards to mother Michelle Pfeiffer's legal affairs), carries us right along on Astrid's rocky path to becoming an adult, while director Peter Kosminsky handles all the changes in her young life with incredible sensitivity and deeply-felt emotion. Performances from the large cast, particularly by the women, are excellent. ***1/2 from ****",/review/rw2935543/?ref_=tt_urv

","Since the birth of Hollywood, countless films have aspired to dispel the myths surrounding the city of lights, cameras, and action. Films like 1950's ""Sunset Boulevard"" and 1991's ""Bugsy"" have juxtaposed palm trees, sunshine, and mansions with murder, jealousy, and madness. These films look pretty and bright, but they showcase the darkest shades of human nature. With his adaptation of Janet Fitch's novel ""White Oleander,"" Peter Kosminsky tries to join the ranks of such Hollywood demystifiers as Billy Wilder and Robert Altman. On that front, he succeeds only marginally. However, on other fronts, he accomplishes quite a bit.",/review/rw2935543/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie was OK, but it seemed better suited for the Lifetime network. The plot seemed like a sob story for an Oprah show.  We follow Astrid, whose mom is sent to prison for murder, as she is sent to 3 different foster families.  Her first foster mom gets jealous of her when she is around her boyfriend and goes crazy.  The second mom turns out to be a basket case that is very depressed.  And the third mom is just kind of out there.  Throughout the movie, Astrid keeps in contact with her mom and thinks her mom doesn't want her to be happy, which seemed pretty much true. This movie should have been a little shorter, and the music could have been better. Also, there is the mystery of Astrid's eyebrow color. In some scenes when she's blond, her eyebrows are dark and in others light. When she dyes her hair, her eyebrows are dark. So obviously they must have reshot some scenes with the blond hair after she had already dyed her hair black. It was just very noticeable.",/review/rw2935543/?ref_=tt_urv
