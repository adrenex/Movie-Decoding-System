2 August 2018,ThomasDrufke,6," Revenge isn't as Sweet
","If there's anyone in Hollywood that I would believe is actually a real life bada**, it's probably Denzel Washington. The first Equalizer was a surprisingly brutal and visceral action film that gave Liam Neeson movies a run for its money. While the sequel is full of just as many, if not more, incredible kill sequences by Denzel's character, I think there's a lack of connection I felt this time around. I wasn't nearly as connected to the story, and perhaps that's because the revenge didn't feel as sweet this time around. The ending of the film is a great sequence on its own and there are certain scenes I will certainly revisit, but I'm not sure the film as a whole works quite as well.",/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2018,Vivekmaru45,8," Solid sequel to the original.
","I was well entertained on Sunday when I watched the film. Denzel Washington is a favorite actor of mine. I have seen such good films of his in the past: Philadelphia(1993), The Pelican Bried(1993), Crimson Tide(1995), Virtuosity(1995), Fallen(1998), The Bone Collector(1999), The Hurricane(1999),Training Day(2001), John Q(2002) and many more...",/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2018,SnoopyStyle,7," solid action thriller
",Ex-intelligence operative Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) works as a mobile app driver. He enjoys his customers while delivering vigilante justice to those deserving it. He helps his neighbors and mentors local young man Miles. His friend and former operative Susan is killed in a presumed robbery but his investigation uncovers a murderous conspiracy.,/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2018,nogodnomasters,9," I Expect a Five Star Rating.
","The film gives us a quick view of Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) doing what he does best. Next we see him as a Lyft Driver in Boston, no longer the odd neat freak hermit from the first feature. As a driver, this develops several unconnected subplots, one of which doesn't fit in. Then folks start to die, and he investigates, getting too close. ",/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2018,darkwizard404,5," Very slow and predictable
",I had my expectations high because I was very impressed with the first one. Unfortunately this one is a bit of a disappointment owing to the pacing and predictability of the story. It was slower and boring. If they decide to make a third one then they should make it a bit more fast paced.,/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2018,bastille-852-731547,7," Denzel Delivers A Solid, If Unspectacular, Follow-Up
","I'm a fan of Denzel Washington and enjoyed the first ""Equalizer"" movie. That said, ""The Equalizer"" was not a film I was necessarily clamoring for a sequel to--although I still was looking forward to it since Denzel Washington and the action scenes in the trailer would be worthwhile. After seeing ""The Equalizer 2"" at an advance screening, I can say that while the film is not perfect, it's an entertaining ride for adult action junkies that is on par with the first movie in terms of quality.",/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2018,esferdez,9," I just want to mention one part
","The movie is good. Im a Denzel fan, and a Fuqua fan, so naturally i enjoyed it. I would like to draw attention to one part specifically - when Denzel has the serious talk with the young gentleman after they get off the elevator about halfway through. In my humble opinion, acting doesn't get any better than that. It is the cream resting at the top of his consistently excellent work. A remarkable example of the power of film.",/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2018,Aktham_Tashtush,7," Denzel Washington is The Equalizer as much as Keanu Reeves is John Wick
","Yes ,, maybe the plot was a bit predictable but in no way it was slow ,, in fact i can't believe how fast it went in few parts ,, and Denzel did just a mesmerizing job ,, and his speech with the kid ""Miles"" after he found him with the gang !! Oh man !! it was powerful ... Acting level infinity.",/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2019,FrenchEddieFelson,6," Almost boring
","If in the first opus, Robert McCall annihilates the Russian underworld of Boston, on the other hand, in the second opus, he ... helps. He just helps, nothing more. By being slightly in bad faith: he helps an elderly brother to find his sister, he helps a young woman abused by 3/4 men, he helps a student with his art studies, he helps a mother to find her young daughter gone on the wrong train, ...",/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2018,elliotjeory,9," Awesome film
","If you are a fan of Denzel Washington and the first equaliser you will love this. Met expectations in story, action and fight scenes. Yes the first one was probably better but this is still a worthy sequel and highly enjoyable. It would be great if there was a third to complete the trilogy.",/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2018,stevendbeard,7," Quite Entertaining
","I saw ""The Equalizer 2"", starring Denzel Washington-The Magnificent Seven_2016, Man On Fire; Pedro Pascal-Kingsman:The Golden Circle, Game of Thrones_tv; Ashton Sanders-Moonlight, Straight Outta Compton and Orson Bean-Being John Malkovich, Innerspace.
This is a sequel to the 2014 movie that is based on the 1980's tv series. It's also the first time that Denzel has done a sequel. Denzel returns as Robert McCall, the retired spy/assassin that now spends his days just helping ordinary people in need. He drives an Uber, where he meets most of his future clients. In the first movie, he had one person in particular that he wanted to help-Chloe Grace Moretz-from a life of prostitution. This time it's Ashton, a young kid in his apartment building, that is tempted to join a street gang and needs Denzel to put him on the right path. There is also some mercs that kill a good friend of Denzel's-Melissa Leo from the first movie-which is not a smart move, on the bad guys part. And, I'm not giving anything away here, it is shown in the trailers. FYI: Melissa and her husband, Bill Pullman, are the only original cast members making a return for this movie. Of course, Denzel has to give the bad guys some payback, teaching them that it's not a smart idea to mess with the Equalizer. Pedro plays Denzel's old partner, back when he worked for the government, and Orson is another side story person in need of help. There is not much new here-story wise-but it is still quite entertaining. The fights are brutal and most of them are hand to hand, with Denzel setting his watch to time himself, on those special occasions. He also uses knives a lot-I only recall him shooting a gun a few times.
It's rated ""R"" for brutal violence, gore, language and drug use and has a running time of 2 hours & 1 minute.
I really enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2018,george.schmidt,8," Washington continues to excel in this power-driven sequel to a budding franchise tailor made for his talents
","THE EQUALIZER 2 (2018) *** Denzel Washington, Melissa Leo, Pedro Pascal, Ashton Sanders, Orson Bean, Bill Pullman, Jonathan Scarfe, Sakina Jaffrey. Washington reprises his role as redeemer come avenger Rober McCall and this time it's personal: when a dear friend is killed in an international investigation he begins to unravel a conspiracy of murder while attempting to keep his domestic life in check and demons at the door. Filmmaker Antonie Fuqua reunites with his star again and both continue to work well together allowing the star wattage to overpower the murky screenplay by Richard Wenk (based on the '80s TV crime drama on CBS) Skillful action and some surprisingly affective dramatic moments with Washington prove there's more meat on the bone of this genre actioner.",/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2018,kosmasp,7," More but not just the same
","Now depending on how you will see things, you may like the way this goes story-wise or you may hate it. First of all it's not just a rehash of what we saw in the first movie. It also tries to combine a few storylines, that tie together more or less. You have an elderly, a young student sort of thing, a mentor thing and what the Equalizer is good at of course.",/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2018,DarkVulcan29,9," He's back
","Denzel returns as Robert McCall, the man with a deadly set of skills, now works as a chauffear, but does t times helps people in needs. But will really put himself to the test, when his friend(Melissa Leo) is murdered, and he will do what it takes to take them down.",/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2020,MAYESY-44,8," Not as good as the first but still good
",Thought this was weaker than the first because of the story but the action and Denzil are still brilliant in the film which makes it another really good film.,/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2018,masonfisk,9," MORE OF THE SAME & THAT'S A GOOD THING...!
","Denzel Washington's first sequel is a welcome return for his McCall character out for revenge for the murder of his old colleague. Not drifting too far from the formula of the first flick where he kills w/what he has handy, the film is an easy watch w/every villain dispatched roundly as the audience cheers quietly in Denzel's corner. If most people could lead their lives (of course w/o the killing) as Spartanly as he does, oh boy will we get things done.",/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2018,Leofwine_draca,8," As good as the first
","THE EQUALIZER 2 sees director Antoine Fuqua and star Denzel Washington return to the format of the successful first movie for a sequel which is equally as good. It's very much along the lines of the first, with Washington carrying out day-to-day revenge missions as a sideline to his main job as an Uber driver. The revenge plot kicks into gear around halfway through, and from then on in it's a slow build leading up to a clever and memorable climax in a deserted town during a hurricane, of all things. Washington is effortlessly menacing and charismatic as the lead and while there's not a wealth of action, sequences do come regularly and are directed with aplomb and freshness. The film doesn't skimp on the suspense either, with a particularly good bit involving two bad guys hunting for a kid hiding out in a house.",/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2018,jadavix,5," zzz
","The sequel to the box office hit ""The Equalizer"" is surprising only in how boring it is. It's a weary and tiresome trudge through a hopelessly padded out two hour run-time that doesn't even really deliver on the action or violence fronts for most of its length.",/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2018,jeff-cossey,8," Denzel is great as usual
",I really enjoyed his character. He is very methodical very relaxed even in tense situation. Believable no flash just gets the job done. Denzel Washington is very entertaining.,/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2018,subxerogravity,8," There is no equal when it comes to Denzel.
","I'm starting to think that Denzel low key loves action movies and wants to do them. It seems odd that such a heavy hitter like Denzel is a victim of type casting, but it's true. He's such a high caliber actor that many would say it's beneath him to do such a mindless thing as an action movie, but I wouldn't be surprise if Denzel saw his boy Wesley Snipes in Blade or something and was like ""I want to do that"". So when stuff like the Equalizer showcases a fuller acting spectrum, Mr. Washington jumps on the band wagon.",/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2018,view_and_review,7," A Little Less Action, A Little More Substance
","The Equalizer 2 had less action and less fighting than the first but it was no less good. It had a more serious and somber tone and it was definitely more cerebral. Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) was on the trail of those responsible for his friend's death. He had to use some shrewd investigative skills to discover whether or not her death was intentional and who the killers were. But, while Robert was dealing with that he still had time to do some clean up in his hometown of Boston--and I mean clean up in every sense of the words.",/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2018,gradyharp,8," 'There are two kinds of pain in this world. The pain that hurts, the pain that alters.'
","Director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, The Magnificent Seven, Olympus Has Fallen, The Equalizer) once again works with Denel Washington in an arresting continuation of THE EQUALIZER, now Part 2. The film is very dark and brutal and presented with excellent photography (Oliver Wood) and a decent script (Richard Wenk and Michael Sloan), but the final result is a bit belabored and less involving than the first Equalizer.",/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2018,Fields201,7," Denzel Back In Action In This Worthy Sequel
","I was excited for this one as I loved the first one and watched it many times on Blu-Ray. Denzel is like the new Liam Neeson. I love watching him beat the bad guys down. However, this one just didn't feel as good as the first.",/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2018,kjproulx,8," A Superior Follow-Up
","It's not all that often that a film receives lukewarm critical reception and only a decent box office return, but still somehow manages to get its main star and director returning for a sequel, but here we are. The Equalizer 2 has just hit the big screen and I feel my reception of this film is going to be different from many viewers. The first film was a solid movie that took far too much time to get to each action sequence and its runtime was far too long in my opinion. I enjoyed it, but I wasn't raving about it like a lot of moviegoers were. With that said, I find myself feeling that way towards this sequel. In my opinion, The Equalizer 2 takes the best elements of the original film and goes in a new direction, which I think made for a much better viewing experience. Here's why I believe this is a superior film and why you absolutely should check it out if you liked the first film, or if you're just a fan of the genre.",/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," Denzel Washington - once again, made this film better than it was
","So I just finished watching Equalizer (EQ1) again, so I can watch Equalizer 2 (EQ2) for the comparison.",/review/rw4255078/?ref_=tt_urv
