29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," You'll have a good time watching it!
",Leverage is just a flat out fun show. Is is realistic? Of course not. But it's an entertaining show where every episode is smartly written and acted with lots of twists and surprises. Each episode is about this group of former criminals who come up with a con to steal from the rich and help out the needy. It has a very Oceans Eleven feel to it. As you can see by reading through the reviews it's a show where most people who saw it had fun watching it. Obviously people liked it because they brought it back for a reboot with the original cast almost a decade after it went off the air (except Noah Wyle replaces Timothy Hutton bc of Huttons legal problems)!,/review/rw1898486/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2008,Mike_Wiggins,10," Excellent new TV series! Well worth watching!
","It usually takes me about three episodes of a new series to decide if it's worth continuing to watch. With ""Leverage"" I was hooked after the first 15 minutes. I think it's because it seemed to be an amalgam of some of my favorite TV shows of the past. This includes ""The Equalizer"" (righting wrongs using unconventional methods), ""Mission Impossible"" (the TV series)(putting a great team together to work towards a common goal), and ""Banicek"" (solving seemingly perfect crimes).",/review/rw1898486/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Leverage"" is an entertaining, fun show. The cast is stellar, the writing snappy, and the characters are likable. It's nice to see a show that doesn't focus too heavily on the ""dark side"" of everything and can exist without a message.",/review/rw1898486/?ref_=tt_urv

2 December 2008,jimchudnow-1,8," ""LEVERAGE"" -- A Force of 5 Doing-Gooders against the Badders =
","At an advance preview in Chicago (where much of the ""Nigerian"" pilot was shot), stars TIMOTHY HUTTON (as Nathan) and GINA BELLMAN (Sophie) agreed the first entry in their TNT series is somewhat like an updated ""The 'A' Team"" meets ""Mission Impossible"". Along with Christian KANE (as Eliot), BETH RIESGRAF (Parker), and ALDIS HODGE (Alec), they use high-tech methods to get back at a white-collar CROOK (& the series is scheduled to continue the ""Robin Hood-ish"" adventures against criminals and corporate scammers in subsequent episodes). The main characters start out as distrusting of each other, but eventually use their various individual expertises to create a cheeky, fast-moving and enjoyably clever series of retributions against the liars and other baddies in their world. An agreeable and promisingly well-acted start (well shot on HD cameras that allow fast work with much available-light conditions).",/review/rw1898486/?ref_=tt_urv

7 December 2008,jonann2,10," Totally Awesome!!!!!
","When I was a kid, one of my favorite shows was the A-Team. I loved the show because the heroes were themselves criminals who operated outside of the law to help people. Leverage is like a modern A-Team for adults. The actors are also well cast in their roles. Each one of them brings something interesting to the show. I think what I love the most about this show is that it is FUN!! I don't mean fun as in stupid, brainless reality show fun. It's a fun show to watch and you won't loose any brain cells doing it. I sometimes feel like TV nowadays is so ultra serious. There's no fun in TV drama anymore. I feel like adventure caper TV is back, but in a slick, smart format.",/review/rw1898486/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2021,tabuno,9," One of the best feel-good television series
","Timothy Hutton headlines this superlative action series involving a team of specialists headed by Hutton who seek to help those people hurt by greedy corporations and grifters. With deft use of comedic relief, excellent pacing, and intriguing set-ups every stand-alone episode provides captivating entertainment for the little guy. Never seems to get old, age, and offers up little tidbits each time a scene is revisited. One of the best feel-good series on television (in reruns).",/review/rw1898486/?ref_=tt_urv

",Finally there is a show that combines all the charm and intelligence of the Ocean's 11 franchise with the uniquely memorable personalities of the A-Team. Watching the pilot episode of Leverage was really a treat. It's been a long time since I've seen a show at the end of which I found myself truly satisfied. ,/review/rw1898486/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2008,cookiemadeit,9," I Want More.
","I love all the characters, edgy, sporty, funny, brilliantly written, entertainingly presented and just plain ""COOL"". I hope this one stays on TV as long as some of my other favorites. (Law & Order, NCIS, CSI and Criminal Minds). I like TV that entertains with a story, twists, turns, doesn't insult my intelligence and keeps me guessing until the very end. Happy Endings are definitely an incentive to keep watching. I can see character development possibilities galore with each team member and I want more back story on each one already. The nostalgic references to old TV Shows is brilliant, this could be the new A-Team, MacGiver, Mission Impossible and does anybody remember the ""campy"" Charlies Angels? Yes, I will admit to watching all of the above.",/review/rw1898486/?ref_=tt_urv

8 December 2008,rbsjrx,8," Generally positive, but the jury's still out
","I could tell from the trailers that Leverage would be the kind of show I'd enjoy - good guys vs. bad guys without the ambiguity of the legal system to get in the way. It did indeed deliver on that promise. It was cleverly paced and scripted and populated with interesting, likable characters.",/review/rw1898486/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2022,aleph-37246,9," Entertaining and some episodes are definitely worth rewatching.
","This TV series brings together individuals who have achieved excellence in their particular fields and as a team use their skills in an altruistic manner. Each archetypical character brings an interesting back story and personality that is interwoven throughout the series. There is decent character development throughout the series and good banter in the dialogue. Some of the episodes have plot twists that are well thought out. The actors work very well together with good chemistry. And most importantly, some of the episodes, if not the whole series is worth rewatching. The Leverage series reminds me of a modernized and less repetitive version of the A-Team tv series with better writing.",/review/rw1898486/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a copycat of the British show Hustle only not as well acted, it's still fun and interesting. I have to think it was done with permission of the creators because it's too similar right down to the music. If you like Leverage check out Hustle. This series actually got better after the first season.",/review/rw1898486/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2009,dukemunsill94,10," Wow!
","""Leverage?!!!"" People said when they first saw the name of the television series when it came out in 2008. I asked myself the same question when I saw the preview for it on TNT, but when I saw that Timothy Hutton was in it I wanted to see it no matter what the name might be. We all know the Timothy Hutton from the Nero Wolfe T.V. show, on which he played Archie Goodwin, who was a smart, wisecracking, and handsome assistant to the detective of the same name. How could Timothy Hutton be in a movie that is about bad guys? I asked myself after looking up to him most of my life. ""Sometimes bad guys make the best good guys"" which is the motto of the television show. Even though I had my suspicions about it being another profane T.V. show it turned out to be a great show that had great messages in all of its episodes. My brother turned to me one day and said to me about Leverage that ""all of the episodes would make great movies!"" And now after watching all of the first season and part of the second I am convinced of this statement. Is there bad stuff in this show? You are asking yourself at this point and with good cause, but the answer is: no. There are some innuendos in it, but they are very minor. It is basically what you might call a Robin Hood tale of today. The show is worth the watch and should be enjoyed by everyone from 12 and up. Enjoy! -Duke",/review/rw1898486/?ref_=tt_urv

25 December 2020,belacane,8," Interesting to Re-Binge
","We watched the whole series in late 2016, and I remember them fondly but don't remember too much detail other than the character interplay. So we started again with S1E1 last night. What I found most surprising on this re-watch was that (a) Dubenich was actually the guy who brought the team together, not Nate (this had completely escaped me the first time), and (b), the team was pretty relaxed and comfortable with each other right off the bat, with their roles as team players. I feel like the show would have had greater stakes if the first episode, which perhaps could have had a longer runtime as the pilot, had had Nate finding and hiring the team (with difficulty) instead of Dubenich, and had explored their discomfort at working with others, and possibly either ""funny screwup scenes"" or ""dramatic screwup scenes"" as they tried to perpetrate the heist. It just all went a little too smoothly for people who ""always work alone"" and didn't really know each other. Other than that, it's fun, and we're looking forward to re-watching the whole series.",/review/rw1898486/?ref_=tt_urv

","Leverage might after a first show look like a series replica of Oceans Eleven with even the same generic music attached to some scenes, it fares deeper into a storyline you might expect being left on the cutting room floor of that same movie. Revenge being a large element of the series and changing plots, schemes and situations putting a viewer on the wrong foot this show delivers what all the polish and high-speed actors in forenamed picture couldn't actually deliver: credibility!",/review/rw1898486/?ref_=tt_urv
