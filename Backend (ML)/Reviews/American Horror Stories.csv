25 February 2003,raysond,," Why all these transitions?
","It is quite amazing that this series is still seen in repeats in some syndication markets across the country. Actually,in my own opinion it wasn't a bad series by the way since it ran for four seasons on two major networks. First it was on NBC for two seasons,then after NBC canceled the series,UPN picked it up for the duration of its run. The series was produced by the same individuals who were behind another successful series of the 1990's ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"".",/review/rw2444862/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2011,enigma_meets_reality,8," A good show which had so much more potential
","""In the House"" could have been a marquee African American-led sitcom in the mid to late 90s, following end of the Fresh Prince. It wasn't short on star power as it brought together Quincy Jones as an executive producer, and LL Cool J and Debbie Allen in lead roles. The first two seasons were the crowning glory of the show. LL stepped up to the plate admirably as the level headed, injured NFL-turned landlord Marion Hill; but it was Allen's portrayal of the hapless divorc√©e and mother of two Jackie Warren which really brought the show to life. Their interactions provided plenty of laughter, as the more spiritual Marion clashed with the sarcastic Jackie (in addition to her clashes with her kids, her boss, her ex-husband and everyone in-between!).",/review/rw2444862/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2007,wchngliu,7," This show was good.... up until Debbie Allen departed
","I really enjoyed watching the first few seasons of In The House when it was just Marion Hill, and the Warren clan Jackie, Austin and Tiffany. It was very funny and enjoyable to watch. ",/review/rw2444862/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2002,COMPFUNK2,," Too much transition
","Nothing was actually bad per se about any of the four seasons of this show (well, maybe the fourth season), but looking at it from a casting point of view, it was all over the place. The first season revolved around the Warrens--mother, Jackie (Debbie Allen); daughter, Tiffany (Maia Campbell); and son, Austin (Jeffery Wood)--who lived in a duplex alongside the landlord, a retired football player named Marion Hill (LL Cool J). Tonia Harris (Kim Wayans) changed from chasing Marion to becoming his best friend--as well as changing from a recurring character to a permanent character--as the season changed. Also, at the end of the season, Jackie and Austin moved away, leaving Tiffany to live with Marion. In order to afford to take care of her, Marion opened a health clinic with Tonia.",/review/rw2444862/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2021,hypestyle,6," Decent, Inoffensive Family Comedy Starring LL Cool J
","""I guess I need a TV show to get mines, but I don't feel like kissing no director's behind...""
So went the lyrics to ""Ain't No Stoppin' This"", an album track from rapper LL Cool J's ""14 Shots to the Dome"" LP, released in 1993. This is significant because barely two years later, LL's lyrical diss toward rappers who discard their artistic integrity for mainstream fame would come to ring curiously ironic by the time that NBC sitcom ""In the House"" Premiered.",/review/rw2444862/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2001,skmt,," I MISS THIS SHOW
",This is truly a great show. The writing is great. I wish it hadn't been canceled. LL Cool J is very good in the comedy sitcom. His character Marion is very funny. Kim Wayans character Tonia is real ghetto. The combined antics of the characters make a show that will keep u laughing for a while.,/review/rw2444862/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2017,smooth_op_85,8," Dated, but still hilarious!
","I remember watching this on TV when I was a kid. I rediscovered this show and Debbie Allen, known better for being behind the camera returns as Jackie, the mother of Austin and Tiffany. Marion, a football player whose career was cut short by an injury. ",/review/rw2444862/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2014,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,9," An absolute NBC turned UPN classic!
","""IN THE HOUSE,"" in my opinion, is an absolute NBC turned UPN classic! I haven't seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always funny when a mishap occurred. I always laughed at that. If you ask me, it was nice that all of the main characters had stayed with the show throughout its entire run. It seems that no one stays with a show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, if some network ever airs it in reruns again, I hope you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.",/review/rw2444862/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,johnnymacbest,7," Funny and smart.
","LL Cool J in his first TV show? Who would've thought that such a combination can be so successful. Not the least of which is that it has some of the best comedy antics from recent years such as Kim Wayans, one of the funniest characters on the show. Although the first season was good, but not funny, the second and subsequent seasons were by far the best. Sadly, it was canceled after six seasons. It was good while it lasted;hey I watched not just for the laughs, but also the scantily clad babes that would(quite often) permeate throughout the show. But in the end, it's all good and I'm glad to had have the opportunity to watch it while it was on the air because by far and large, In The House is one of the funniest shows that ever came out on the small screen.",/review/rw2444862/?ref_=tt_urv
