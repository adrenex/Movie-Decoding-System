1 September 2003,bob the moo,," Looks good but is a little hollow when it comes down to it
","American back packer Richard is one of millions of travellers all looking for an unique experience.  When in Bangkok he meets the slightly deranged Daffy who leaves him with stories and a map to a beach on a remote island that can't be seen from the sea.  Taking with him 2 French travellers, Richard sets out to reach the island and finds it inhabited by a mix of people living as a small ideallic community.  However internal conflicts rise up with their arrival and a copy of the map that he gave to some friends threaten to expose the paradise community for it's darker roots.",/review/rw0572040/?ref_=tt_urv

14 June 2005,ecwjedi,8," The Beach WILL NOT DIE TODAY
","The Beach is interesting in that some people feel that its terrible while there are others who feel that it is an unsung hero of a movie. When I first saw The Beach, back in 2000, I thought it was OK, not as bad as most people said it was. But, just like with A Life Less Ordinary, The Beach grew on me and I had to watch it again. After seeing it a few more times I really started to pick up on what was going on and realized that at the end of the film the viewer has gone through quite an adventure with Dicaprio and co. The acting, cinematography, music, and story are great and hold up after repeat viewings. The Beach is one of those movies that I watch once a year as its enjoyability never decreases. This is a very solid film that will no doubt only increase in its popularity as time goes by as fans of The Beach are quite hardcore. Even though Dany Boyle has said that he is not very proud of The Beach I believe that he's made a gross error and misjudged his work because even after all these years The Beach still has a freshness to it that most films lose while they are still in the theaters. Because of these reasons The Beach will not die today.",/review/rw0572040/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2000,stamper,7," Pretty good, despite all the bad reviews I've read

2 October 2019,michaeltrivedi,8," Too High a Score?
","I thought it would be right to give The Beach an 8. It's dreamlike scenes on islands really got to me. You really felt like you were a traveler. It was also awesome how an eerie secret comes about, regarding a secret island. It adds a lot of intrigue and suspense. The scenarios that take place on the island are also well done, but I think it was the beginning that really is really appealing. Him discovering the island and getting situated.",/review/rw0572040/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2020,kosmasp,7," Lost
","Paradise - the search of it. Where are we at home? Could we live anywhere? Could we do without all the technical gadgets? I'm not saying living alone (though for some that may be the way to do and live it), but living without certain things that make life ""easier"" ... or at least that is how we perceive it.",/review/rw0572040/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2001,MossMan,8," Why did it get such bad reviews here?
","This is one of the few times that I have been badly mislead by the reviews on IMDb! I avoided this film in the past because of this, but thought it would be a good ""soft"" film to watch on video with with a friend and his wife (she doesn't like difficult films).",/review/rw0572040/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2016,AlsExGal,7," After 16 years I just recently saw this...
","... and I thought it was a pretty good film. When it first came out it was DiCaprio's presence that caused me not to watch it, and after watching him grow as an actor over the last 15 years, DiCaprio is what got me curious enough to give it a try.",/review/rw0572040/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2005,icysky44,10," Do not miss this movie just because of its low rating
","Recently a friend of mine watched ""The Beach"" after I told him my favorite quote (i.e. ""Never refuse an invitation, never resist the unfamiliar, never cease to be polite, and never outstay your welcome""). He enjoyed the movie a whole lot and told me he hadn't watched it before because of it's low IMDb rating. That's when I decided to register here and post a comment - I hope I help someone else to watch the movie because it is worth a watch. What I personally like so much about this movie is that it is not just plain vanilla. It actually makes sense and can be a starting point for new thoughts and ideas - something I truly appreciate in a movie.",/review/rw0572040/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2005,JamesHitchcock,7," Travel Narrows the Mind Wonderfully
","Ever since (at least) the eighteenth century, with its cult of the ""noble savage"", tropical islands have frequently been seen in Western culture as the nearest that it is possible to come to Paradise on earth. This view is often reflected in the cinema, in films such as ""The Blue Lagoon"" or the various versions of ""Mutiny on the Bounty"", in which the idyll of Tahiti is contrasted with the rigours of life on board a British warship. The two versions of ""Lord of the Flies"", like the William Golding novel on which they are based, offer an ironic twist on this theme; a tropical island is used as the setting for an anti-Utopian story in which an attempt to found a new society ends in a relapse into barbarism.",/review/rw0572040/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2002,atzimo,10," Very good
","I'll be brief. I didn't want to watch 'The Beach' because of the bad reviews, but when I accidentally came across it while surfing through the channels, I couldn't stop watching.",/review/rw0572040/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2002,Dockelektro,8," Cult movie potential
","Like the many times referenced ""Apocalypse Now"", this one could really reach the status of cult movie among the nature lovers and hippy heirs. The movie its all the perfect spots during the first half. The beach, the people, the rhythm, the actors, the music... all is stunning. They even sing Bob Marley by the fire. But the film's second half is strange, erratic, scattered, it leaves the awe-inspiring journey sense and centers in a strange and sudden ""mood"" by DiCaprio's Richard. This is where the letdown is fully, although the ending doesn't feel disappointing. As for the cult movie potential, I think the next generations must judge it, but it has a great deal of bitterness to it and if two years later the film isn't a ""word of mouth"" phenomenon, maybe it won't have such a cult afterall. Anyway, I thought it was a great work by the scottish team of ""Trainspotting"", the script is an asset, and I say it again, DiCaprio is not just a pretty face. Recomend it to all people from 18 up. Live it and think about it. I sure liked it anyway...",/review/rw0572040/?ref_=tt_urv

20 April 2003,dbdumonteil,3," on the beach...
","In the beginning of 2000, everyone waited impatiently, the release of the movie ""the beach"", mainly because Leonardo DiCaprio was in the main role. You thought that he was going to carry on with dignity, following the huge commercial and artistic success of ""Titanic"". But sadly, it's not the case. This movie that is a new variation of the lost paradise is a disappointment.",/review/rw0572040/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2020,imseeg,5," Starts out interesting, but half way through it simply implodes as a mediocre, silly plot about teenagers on holiday...
","The good:
The music is great. The beach scenery is gorgeous and beautifully photographed. Actors are good. What's not to like? Even this story starts out interesting at first, but after 45 minutes things definitely turn sour:",/review/rw0572040/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2000,Buddy-51,," not very gritty story of survival
","Is this merely `Survivor' without the million-dollar payoff?  Or is it a modern vision of James Hilton's most famous novel?  For those too young to have any memories of `Lost Horizon,' `The Beach' may seem like a wildly new and original work.  And, as this is, essentially, a narcissistic youth fantasy starring teen-idol Leonardo Di Caprio, chances are that most of the film's audience will indeed be hovering somewhere near the puberty mark. Since the cast of characters is so youthful to begin with, the film is able to dispense with  or, at the most, treat obliquely  one of the major themes that runs through `Lost Horizon,' that of the universal lure of Eternal Youth.",/review/rw0572040/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2007,Theo Robertson,4," As Appealing As A Trip To The Beach On A Rainy Day
","Ah backpacking across the world . What an exciting thing it is - but only if you're a rare and remarkable person . Travelling all over the world isn't all it's cracked up to be . You might get a one night stand , you might get stoned but to be honest couldn't you have got that at home ? Did you really need to go the ends of the earth for that ? If you're a rare remarkable person you'll also get altitude sickness , suffer dysentery , catch ringworm and under go a rabies scare . You'll have wasted all your money on plane tickets and inoculations and the only thing you'll have to show for it is a small paragraph in the obituary column of the local newspaper after dying from a rare tropical disease ",/review/rw0572040/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2022,The-Sarkologist,4," Escape from Modernity
","I watched this film ages ago in the cinema and wasn't really all that keen about it. However, upon visiting Phuket and the Adaman Islands, all of a sudden the tour guides are referencing this film and a part of me wondered why it was that people were getting really excited about a film that wasn't particularly all that great. Then again, The Hangover Part 2 was referenced in Bangkok simply because it was filmed in Bangkok, and one of the really high end luxury hotels made an appearance in it. Anyway, it turned out that Khai Island and Maya Bay are two locations that appear in the film, though ironically Khai Island now and Khai Island back when the film was made are two completely different beasts (Khai Island is now full of shops and bars, and surrounded perpetually by boats).",/review/rw0572040/?ref_=tt_urv

14 April 2002,Juli-4,8," Backpacking in Thailand, oh yeah! :))
","When I was travelling in Thailand, everyone was talking about the ""Beach"" and all backpackers aimed for its filming location, Koh Phi Phi. Although I watched a lot of good movies in the touristic cafes on Khao San Road in Bangkok and in Penang, Malaysia, I missed the ""Beach"" and came home wondering what it was all about. I finally saw it yesterday and in spite of a couple of flaws, I genuinely enjoyed it! First of all, it really shows the atmosphere of Thailand - the golden Buddha, the tiny rooms with thin partitions in the guesthouses, the markets, the internet cafes, the tourists' clothes and their very behavior... Second, the landscape is amazing, Leonardo is quite good, although he's had better movies in his career, but he's definitely very convincing in this role, and the girl playing Francois is quite charming. Also, the movie is funny! Third, this movie has a great moral message. Following the tradition of ""Lord of the Flies"" and others, it shows the dangers of separated communities, the disappearance of rules, regrets, the little value human life has in extreme situations, the dangers of a despotic ruler. It shows that the longed-for paradise might not actually be that easy to live in.",/review/rw0572040/?ref_=tt_urv
