5 November 2022,ykjdh,8," Decent Mel Gibson flick
","I read the bad reviews before checking it out and they all had one thing in common. Each one bashed Mel Gibson and not the actual movie. If you hate him that much why even watch his movie?? I mean, you do realize he got top billing before deciding to sit through this right??",/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2022,jtindahouse,7," Has an energy that makes it impossible to dislike
","I probably wasn't planning to watch 'On the Line', however the synopsis sounded like my kind of movie and I realised it had been a long time since I'd seen Mel Gibson in anything. So I gave it a shot. Man, the energy in this one was wild.",/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2022,dima-12,7," Well-made programmer with an inspired star turn
",On the Line by Romuald Boulanger is a resourceful and well-acted Mel Gibson vehicle in which director smartly puts his star front and center for an hour and the half and charisma does the rest.,/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2022,Impartial-Reviewer,," Why The Negativity?
","I didn't plan to check this movie neither to write a review about it but I thought out of the amount of negative feed back that I should lay some truth ""in my own opinion""...",/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,usfder-70853,8," Interesting movie
",I have to say the movie really got me hooked the cat and mouse play the psychotic villain that is out for revenge and the plot twisting in the end really got me.,/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2022,robertseibert-20986,10," Have no idea why this flick has low reviews, this was awesome!?
","Really like this movies and Mel does a great job! Generally, some movies have great bizarre endings, but this has two endings that trick you and would have never thought Not sure why this has a somewhat low rating and I generally only watch films with a higher ratings, but a friend told me this ""On the line"" was stellar, so I watched it and glad I did! Boy this site wants you to write a book with your review, funny still being told I have some 250 characters needed, so I'll just ramble about this flick and how good it was and how the ending left me dazzled some! Very good movie and don't pay attention to dolts that say otherwise!",/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2022,nogodnomasters,6," You destroyed my life
","Elvis Clooney (Mel Gibson) is clearly a fictional name for an egotistical character. Elvis shows us he is a dedicated family man (when not eating a hamburger) and goes to work for the graveyard shift as a shock jock radio talk show host. It is soon to be his birthday, which everyone seems to have forgotten. The calls are mundane as there is nothing shocking about what he says. Soon a caller named Gary (Paul Spera) makes claims about getting revenge against Elvis by killing his family. Elvis and his staff spring into action and notify the police as the man is in his house and threatening his family.",/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2022,rebeltaz-18705,8," Fun Movie with a Fun Twist
",A lot of the negative reviews is probably just because of the hatred of the star - Mel Gibson. I've always liked him. The guy is a good actor and plays the parts he plays well. This is no different.,/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2022,danieljfarthing,3," Abysmal so-called thriller with uniformly dire performances & too little too late twists
","Abysmal so-called thriller ""On The Line"" woulda (thankfully) gone unnoticed but for Mel Gibson being its lead... but he's as dire here as his co-stars (ie truly DIRE). As a dick nocturnal LA shock-jock he's called by psycho Paul Spera who's snatched his wife & kid (and rigged his building with explosives (sigh)). Cue dumb, over-cooked cat 'n' mouse guff between Spera and Gibson (aided by the likes of Alia Seror O'Neil, William Mosely & Kevin Dillon). The cast are uniformly dreadful, but the real stinker here is French writer / director Romuald Boulanger with his first (and hopefully last) English language film. Despite its too-little too-late twists, it's a total turd. Flush!",/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv

",Oh my lord. Holy moly canoly.,/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2022,imseeg,3," Skip the first half hour. Then skip the second. And finally skip the third. Only watch the end credits!
","I am a Mel Gibson fan. The guy has aged well, even looks better in some regards then when he was younger (babyface) and I still like to watch (SOME of) his movies nowadays. NOT this one though...",/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2022,brandonmckay8,9," A unexpected gem, must watch!
","I've found myself watching any Mel Gibson movie, see his name & I'll check it out.. based on the last few I wasn't expecting much from this but I was pleasantly surprised. This was a brilliant thriller that was well written & cast really well. The whole time was edge of your seat & trying to figure things out & when you thought you had it they'd hit you with another twist. I know this film won't be for everyone & I can already tell the 5 star rating will probably hold as I sense you're either going to love this or hate, not much in between. I personally loved it & so did my family I watched it with. It was full of twists & stressful moments & even some comedy. Well done to all involved!",/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2022,kskmah,2," Stupid Movie
","First I would of hanged up on him. Any threating or violence or crazy person would be cut off or not still be allowed on air. You know by now he's crazy, so why even talk to him more? You can't trust him because he's a liar. He can see where you are walking? He had a sign in the room? OMG. Really stupid. The bad guy knows where they are going? Also the bad guy planned this very well and Elvis thinks he would just be in the camera room? The bad guy kills random people so you can't trust him. The bad guy ultimately wants to listen and play with him so don't. When to cop came to the door, he had no idea what was going on? They already called the cops so they should all know what was happening. Stupid. And Elvis and the other guy didn't say there is a bomb on the door? And the twist ending was stupid and the 2nd twist ending was worst. You can fall down a flight of stairs and fake not getting hurt? Good acting, but dumb movie.",/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,sevsevencom,1," You will hate yourself for having watched this at the end.
","Prepare to lose 1:44 Of your life watching this movie just to be enraged at the ending..
is that a spoiler? I don't think so.",/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2022,illyasmith66,7," Regardless of the poor reviews this is is a fun ride.
","I cannot believe the amount of negative reviews for this film. Jeez Louise! It was a fun ride, very much in the vein of Michael Douglas's The Game.",/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2022,kuner-59029,6," Mel Gibson plays an ahole
","As evident by the other ratings, most people are going to hate the twist. Much like with the new Halloween movie, many people no longer want to be surprised. They want to go into a movie and have their expectations met, like ordering a BigMac. No deviations allowed.",/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2022,tonyconch-81829,8," Chilling
","I have always loved Mel Gibson movies and this one did not disappoint. I almost didn't watch because of the low ratings so far which I expect to rise dramatically after word of mouth begins to work its magic. Best twist since the I see dead people movie. I really recommend this to anyone, it had me on the edge all thru. Well done and bravo to all involved. Damn 300 is a lot of characters I mean am I a professional or what's? That number should be lowered to.a hundred so you don't get spoilers. Most people nowadays don't know enough words to do 300 characters on a movie review, much less 300 that mean anything. Loved the flic though.",/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2022,amanjourney-78822,1," Shockingly TERRIBLE!!
",I agree with one of the other (human) reviewers. Anything over a 2 is a bot or marketing. This was terrible! Awful!! Laughable!!!,/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2022,DeepRest,5," I was really liking it, until it turned into...
","David Fincher's The Game. That movie came out over 25 years ago, and it seems like a lot of people have never seen it here. I read reviews praising the twist, and how clever it was. The Game had a premise that didn't fall apart, once you thought about it afterwards. I can't say the same for On The Line. It had to go with the double twist, which was predictable the moment the guy fell down the stairs. It was a decent movie, but I wish the ending had been better. It was basically a double joke ending in a movie that is advertised as being an intense thriller. Had it not turned into The Game (1997) meets April Fool's Day (1986) in the end, this could have been at least a 7. But the ending just left me empty.",/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,linkler,10," Just AWESOME! You think the trailer gave away the whole movie? But it did not!
","This movie is great! I enjoyed this movie a LOT for 3 main reasons:
1) When you watch the trailers nowadays, you don't feel like you want to watch the movie anymore, since it looks absolutely clear... They give away everything in the trailers today. This movie is NOT the case. Thanks to the creators it was awesome experience!",/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2022,penofinspiratin,3," I FOR ONCE HAVE NO WORDS
","The script is a paradox, but since I need 600 words to explain it, well I'll just say
Be patient to the end, at the end that's when you question not just what you sat through

8 November 2022,rcr-37510,9," It's pretty incredible!
",First I'll say that I love Mel Gibson. I hope he never needs or wants to retire. Naturally I put this movie as a priority to watch and moved it to the front of the queue. Great decision!,/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2022,jharaldson-73888,2," The Ending Ruins the whole thing
",I was very entertained for the first half of the movie. It kept me interested and invested. Then it turned into a typical bad movie where they make stupid decisions and everyone starts to get annoying.. but I kept watching hoping the ending would be a epic conclusion.. not at all.,/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2022,Wizart3D,10," WAY UNDERATED! I loved this movie so much, I cried with happiness at the end!
","OMG!!! I don't know how to explain why I loved this so much without ruining the ending. All I can say is, IN ALL HONESTY! Unless you're easily frightened, vindictive, easily angered over being taken for an idiot, OR! Just have a biased hatred toward Mel Gibson, anyone not suffering from the above psychosis and who loves a really awesome ending with a couple of completely unexpected twists, will simply be hugely surprised at what a GREAT MOVIE THIS TRULY IS.",/review/rw8660578/?ref_=tt_urv
