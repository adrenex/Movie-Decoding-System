25 June 2020,jerzbouy-427-23672,8," A six season roller coaster
","It's 2020 and I finally got around to watching this series. From start to finish there is so much wrong with it and so much right it left me loving it and hating it. At one point during my binge I felt enough is enough is enough and almost stopped. But, and there is always a but, I just had to know how the series ended, having no fore knowledge. The first two seasons showed me why it was such a talked about series. Then the roller coaster ride started. Same old stuff over and over only with a make over. The scheming, betrayals, and back-stabbing was getting on my nerves. If not for the occasional surprise to breakup the predictability and add new characters I might have given up. Fortunately, the guys kept it together enough to keep me interested. Not that the young ladies were not fantastic in their collective rolls. It was just that their characters were getting soooooooo annoying. The concept alone was great and even the worst episode had it high points. In short my rating started with a 10, bounced between 9 and 5 and was saved by the ending with 8 as the result.",/review/rw7774695/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2017,nateyarchibald,9," Strangely Addicting Amoral Guilty Pleasure
","I binged this show on Netflix and found it quite addicting, even when it became increasingly farcical in the later seasons. While the characters and story lines could be silly at points I have to say the acting was better than on most teen shows. Leighton Meester, Ed Westwick, Taylor Momsen and Kelly Rutherford were particularly strong. I loved the fashion, the NY setting, and the music. I adored the copious film references as well. While the non-stop bed hopping and relationship merry go round got annoying, one of the main couples has the best chemistry I've seen on any television show in years. These two are reminiscent of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara, a touch like Bonnie & Clyde and very Beatrice & Benedick. This one relationship really carries the show emotionally and makes it worth watching until the end to see how it is resolved. ",/review/rw7774695/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2020,sessionshamonne,10," Don't believe the trash reviews, it's a great show
","I watched this show in 2019-20 and it did nothing but make me wish I became a fan back when the show was considered relevant. I am currently writing this review at 4:38 AM because I just sat in my bed and binge watched season 6. I have been watching Gossip Girl for months. Initially, I was just looking for a show to watch in my free time. I then spent months using whatever free time I had with my eyes pressed to the screen.
Some say the show is boring, but it is far from it. I can't possibly fathom how a show with this much drama can be called boring. It can get annoying how they can't ever have a public function without a side of public humiliation, but it's so fascinating you can't help but wonder what comes next. Ed Westwick was my favorite character on the show and had THE best character development out of everyone! The only complaint I have is finding another show to watch after I have dedicated months to completing Gossip Girl LMAO!",/review/rw7774695/?ref_=tt_urv

6 September 2015,cyndita,10," This series is addicting
","I started to watch this series last month on Netflix (2015), and was so hooked I couldn't wait for the next episode. I also agree with all the positive comments. Being born and raised in Manhattan, I loved that it took place in my city. Even though I was not raised in affluence, The series made me imagine that I did. The acting was so superbly done by everyone, especially Ed Westwick and Leighton Bleester. Their chemistry was so intense and real, it seemed amazing they didn't get together in real life. I'm so sorry that it's over, but happy that I can play it over again whenever I want. I think that we will be seeing a lot more of Ed Westwick in the future; he is an amazing talent.",/review/rw7774695/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2009,insomniac_rod,6," Lifestyles of the rich and the famous. Why would someone bother?
","First of all, this show is extremely clich√©d in every single aspect. The characters are spoiled brats that have an easy life that deals with economic benefits, partying all the time, and love interests. Also, their main conflicts happen when ""someone"" or ""something"" doesn't behave or happen according to the unwritten rules of popularity or social conventionalism. ",/review/rw7774695/?ref_=tt_urv

17 May 2019,ComedyFan2010,9," A show that is ridiculous and yet so fun and addicting
","I binge watched Gossip Girl on Netflix in about two weeks. I just couldn't stop. Many people complain about it not being realistic. And it isn't. It is pretty ridiculous in some parts. It is a soap opera where people keep on falling in love with others in their friends group and then 10 minutes later be crazy in love with another of their friends. And where they do horrible things to each other but after hating each other for a few episodes are best friends again. But this is also what makes it entertaining. It is an over the top show about rich people with very exciting lives.
I liked the characters. A lot of them seem to be extremely irritating at some point but then you start loving them again (which I guess explains how they go from hating to loving each other as well). not just the teenagers but adults are a big part of the show with exciting story lines. I loved Lily and Rufus. Two of my favorite characters on the show. Rufus the kind and moral father, Lily a real badass that was such a great business partner with her stepson Chuck. Main teenage characters are also great. Blair and Chuck are iconic characters who kept me watching.
Side characters were also great. Especially Dorota. I loved her. She brought so much humor to the show and I loved her relationship with Blair. Eleanor and Cyrus didn't get enough screen time in my opinion.
We got to see some awesome guest characters that brought us exciting stories. Some of them were villains that we loved to hate because they kept us entertained, like Georgina for example.
I was sad when it ended but I was satisfied with the finale. You will be surprised by who the Gossip Girl is. I personally am not disappointed even though it didn't make sense when you look back to some incidents. They probably only decided on who it is at the very end. So many were disappointed. But I am willing to look it over, considering that the explanation was pretty good and it all that matters in a very unrealistic yet fun show.
I hear there might be a reboot and I really hope so!",/review/rw7774695/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2012,allyson-munger,10," Thoughts
","I love this show!!!I just got finished with Season 4 on Netflix, and am patiently waiting for Season 5! It is a wonderful escape show for me, and it got better and better the more I watched it! Chuck Bass I would say is the best actor in that show! Wonderful job with the voice tonation, and you just grow to love him! At first I thought he was an evil brat, but there were reasons for him to act that way. He has a smoking hot evil aloofness. Blair is an excellent match for him, and I always cheer when the two of them get back together!! Serena is beautiful, but what a dingbat!! She cant decide which sock to put on first! Jenny Humphrey makes me cringe, with that bleached out hair, and whiny voice and evilness beyond repair. Dan Humphrey gets a little old also, for such a do gooder, hes sure slept with enough women! Rufus Humphrey is too emasculated. Lily Humphrey is just too dry. Dorota is a pleasure!!! So is Blairs mother, and her little hubby!!! I did like the little french girl that Chuck was with! He was so in love with her, she was the only one besides Blair that he should be with.",/review/rw7774695/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2010,korana555,10," A guilty pleasure that brings you a touch of upper east side!
","I watched this show first time few months ago when airing started in Croatia. I got hooked. It's a guilty pleasure. You have that sorta glamor and that little over the top drama. It has so many twists and turns, you can try to guess what will happen next, but you never know. In one moment you can hate one character because of something, and in the other moment that one is great, but someone else is now the one you should hate. Season Finale of Season 1 airs tomorrow in Croatia. Me and my best friend, we always watch Gossip Girl while texting each other. It's a great show for all the ones that love the guilty pleasure kind of shows. I think a guilty pleasure show is a show where there is a lots of drama and you get hooked easily, and you can't stop following it.",/review/rw7774695/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you enjoy spending your time watching the petty dramas of a group of spoiled teens that have nothing to worry about in their lives,but their social place among the elite and of course other people's lives then that's the show for you.....Someone mysteriously knows everyone about everyone and at some point they reveal that this was only doable because of their pathetic behaviors and back stabbings...The acting is quite poor in many cases,not that it makes a difference with such a plot.Everyone sleeps with everyone and that only helps in the escalation of acts of jealousy,hate and betrayal....Another ""calofornia teens"",in short. Too bad the only it has to offer is how to think and be the lesser person.....",/review/rw7774695/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2017,maggiesullivan-81877,7," good show
","The show Gossip Girl is an insider's guide to the life of the elite. It is filled with teenagers acting like adults and adults acting like teenagers, with one person exposing their every move with the help of the entire Upper East Side. Secrets and betrayals are two things that this show revolves around, along with putting friendships and relationships to the test. If you are not interested in on going drama that seems to always circle back around to where it started, I would not recommend. However, if a show filled with interesting characters, dramatic plot twists, and an appealing setting, you will be hooked.",/review/rw7774695/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2017,alanhewitson,9," The curiosity of the website 'Gossip Girl' is frustrating, fascinating and frightening. Everything about the show is incredibly amazing.
","'Gossip Girl' is an amazing TV show, with outstandingly - well - played characters. The whole concept of being made into a curiosity of this website 'Gossip Girl' is fascinating, as well as frightening; which gives it a delightful twist, capturing pleasured viewers. *Spoiler alert of a future relationship if you have not yet watched S01XE07 and further to S02XE25*. Blair's attempts to allure and attract Chuck are both humorous and magnificently manipulative. She's head over heels for this harsh 'play boy', which can be quite deceiving as Chuck's idea of wit is heavily intimidating and cruel; yet, the way that she alters his unpleasant ego is emotionally stunning. We soon find out that he's crushing on Blair, though he acts like it isn't true in order to 'save' his bad - boy reputation, or feel even a small amount of guilt. That's what makes it entertaining and attractive. As for other relationships, which are a major part of this show; the struggle of choice for the 'it - girl' Serena delves deep into your heart as you gloom over the handsome men that she has to choose between,especially the main ones, as though you are choosing between them yourself. Overall, the show is incredibly amazing. There, like most other shows, are some annoyances along the beautiful journey in this show; yet's mostly fantastic and I definitely recommend it to females and males aged in between 11 - 29.",/review/rw7774695/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2018,AdrienneGrayceMusic,7," Unrealistic but enjoyable
","This is a show I love to hate and hate to love. It took awhile to get going. Although this show is about as unrealistic as it gets, you have to keep in mind it is tv..and not intended on being REAL. The characters have almost all been with each other romantically, sort of like Melrose place. Some of the storylines were not that great or interesting but at the end of the episode, I still found myself anxiously awaiting the next. I never watched the show when it aired. Just recently watched on Netflix. I watched all episodes over about a week's time. My least fave character was JENNY. There was something about her that I couldn't stand. The The character ""Chuck Bass"" had facial expressions and a voice that was exaggeratedly done and sort of annoying but I still liked him. I don't think there was one single episode that didn't include the line ""I am chuck Bass"" in it. I give the show a 7 because the storylines could have been better, but it was still entertaining enough to watch. I was bummed out that I ran out of episodes to watch. The ending was not what I hoped for but it is what it is.",/review/rw7774695/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I started watching Gossip Girl, I was mostly interested by Chuck and Blair, who have that manipulativeness that Choderlos de Laclos gave his characters in 'Les Liaisons Dangereuses', which I happen to love.
