",I'm so beyond high school but I really like to watch movies that makes me feel I'm young again and miss it high school is always high school over the ages. Regardless of students high straighten close in the movie.,/review/rw8608192/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,insaneular-21186,8," fun teen movie
","I don't expect much from Netflix teen movies these days, but this one exceeded my expectations. It has a target audience, so if you're outside of that, you might not love it, but it was a lot more enjoyable and had more surprises plot-wise than I expected. Plus some fun homages to 90s/2000s teen movies. Definitely a notch above a lot of other Netflix movies. There were moments I rolled my eyes and THOUGHT it was going someplace stupid, but then it went in a new direction that kept things interesting. If you're in the mood for a (slightly) dark teen comedy then this movie is a very solid choice.",/review/rw8608192/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,chelmold,10," Great homage to 90's teen movies
","We loved this. Like Clueless meets Cruel Intentions with some 10 Things I Hate About You and She's All That rolled in. They get backstabbing sabotaging teenaged girl relationships very right. All the crazy outfits were so much fun. The soundtrack was full of a great mix of modern music and 90's music. I loved that they included Sarah Michelle Gellar as the headmaster. Sophie Turner has a fun small part. I wasn't familiar with the younger actors, but I thought they all did a great job, no duds in this cast. I would definitely watch this again and I'd recommend it as a good time to anyone who has 90's teen nostalgia!",/review/rw8608192/?ref_=tt_urv

20 September 2022,codytheway,4," You almost had me...and then the ending happened
","I was watching the movie thinking ""yeah this is alright for a Netflix movie. Entertaining enough."" And then the ending happened. Drea randomly exposes Eleanor as 'Nora' to the friend group. They all make fun of her for a minute and then Nora runs off crying and Drea runs after her to apologize. Like...why are you apologizing to a psychopath? Nora literally hit you with a car and put you in the hospital. She destroyed your future. She destroyed your social standing. Yet you felt bad for exposing her? And then you make up and become friends in the end? This was....beyond unrealistic. Who the hell forgives someone who purposely hit you with their car? The movie should have ended with Eleanor ending up in jail or in a psych ward because she is a certified psychopath.",/review/rw8608192/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,madisonquince-45561,10," A 2022, 2000s vibe
","I actually loved this movie! It's very much a modern day clueless, cruel intentions and mean girls kind of film. It doesn't take itself too seriously and it's fun for a girls night. Everyone gives such a fun performance! Camila Mendes really delivered on carrying the movie and the rest of the cast did such a great job creating the world. Don't go in expecting a cinematic masterpiece but just enjoy a fun revenge movie with a glass of wine and some chocolate. I've been waiting for a fun movie to watch on a Friday night and I've found it! It's cinematically cool and gives a fresh take on a modern rom com/ revenge film.",/review/rw8608192/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2022,ranwulfs,4," Started like fun fluff...
","...but turned out so lost. Plot twist after plot twist, characters changing constantly, and I'm still not one hundred percent sure what finally happened in the end. This makes Sixteen Candles and a host of other 1980's movies look like high art. Adults playing teenagers is nothing new, but this time it was too much. Some of the scripted references were far too old to be even recognizable by the ""kids"" in the story. And let's talk about those kids for a moment, and how most characters were entirely miscast. The tall, gawky girl from Stranger Things should thank her lucky stars she's getting roles, because she's completely unconvincing as the newest hot girl in the high school. Not happening for a millisecond. And what's her name from Riverdale is certainly hot, but 10 or more years too old to play the role. And who's the short shrimp dude who's supposed to be everyone's dream come true? This guy is supposed to be the most popular boy in school? Does this day school have no jocks? Or perhaps no boys over 5'3""? Casting, people - casting. And it goes without saying that - of course - every bad person in the film is a man, and all of the good people are women (even if they did begin as borderline psychotics). The level of wokeness at first seemed tongue-in-cheek, almost a parody of Netflix's current political push. It wasn't. It was all over the place, as usual. Honestly, this film could have been 60 minutes, and it still would have gone on too long. It didn't know what it wanted to be, so tried to be everything. Hard pass, people - a hard pass.",/review/rw8608192/?ref_=tt_urv

18 September 2022,cschmidt-43444,5," Started off as fun and ended on a very questionable moral
",First of all: This movie is very cheesy and I kind of liked that. It really captured the vibes of the movies it pays homage to. The dialogue and the acting are both pretty weak and over the top at times but I still enjoyed myself.,/review/rw8608192/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,sareed1971,4," 20 something's playing high school kids...yet again
","It's really getting ridiculous having 20 something's (in this case, at a minimum, a 24yo, 26yo and 28 yo) playing high school students. They don't look like high school students by any stretch of the imagination. But we're stuck with them here and stuck with this script written as if these are real teens. Do writers really believe teenagers talk like this? That most have stopped saying 'like' every other word and express themselves like ultra jaded 40+ adults? Enough with the constant witty repartee and the incredibly intense self-insight. Few real life adults have as much world-weary insight as these teen characters do.",/review/rw8608192/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2022,Tulip88,2," Worst movie I have seen in a while...
","I have been searching for a no brainer movie to watch and relax not having to think much about it, saw Camila Mendes and Maya Hawke and thought why not..
Where to start? A 28 year old Camila playing a 17-year old, that just doesn't work, I like Maya but honestly if her parents weren't Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke ( one of the best and most famous actor of our time) would she really have a shot? To be in Stranger Things? To get any roles? I think not... Lets be honest: she is not a good actress.. Austin Abrams as the hottest and most popular boy in the school? I think not.... Couldn't remember where I saw him before, then googled and realised he plays the looser kid in Euphoria, seriously? A really small role for Sophie Turner, why did she accept this? I find it hard to believe that after Game of Thrones she isn't being offered better roles, it's just sad... the plot is all over the place, 10 times worse then Riverdale, the girls are really evil then good then evil then good again, the makeover for Eleonor (Maya Hawke) just isn't working... overall, a really bad movie. Netflix please do better,this is getting ridiculous ....",/review/rw8608192/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2022,chrischanwasframed,2," A sign of the times
","This was number one movie on Netflix, so how bad could it really be? The answer is very bad. It's like cruel intentions had a baby.with Strangers On A Train which then got brain damage from smoking too much crystal meth and now is in a wheelchair that is driven by blowing a straw. There is more depth in a bag of Cheetos than this hot bag of trash. The main girl with dark hair is very good looking, so that is nice, but.that is not enough to make a good movie. Another thing I don't like is how the dialogue is clearly written by middle aged hipsters with lots of references to 80s movies and stuff than teenagers now would clearly have no idea about, that is just self indulgent and unrealistic.",/review/rw8608192/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,AfricanBro,7," Pretty good watch if you aren't expecting it to be
","So I wasn't expecting to watch this but apparently it was a really good Gen Z movie so I was curious. There were scenes that weren't meant to be funny that I laughed at a lot. Also, not a groundbreaking concept discovery but different generations really aren't so different, just use different language and gadgets because about an hour in it stops being a Gen z movie and just a gaudy high school movie. At some point thought the movie was over but there was still a chunk of time left and it only got better with the twists, the last one not so much but it needed a happy ended. This may not start out as a movie for everyone but it is way better than I expected. It's a pretty good watch especially if you're expecting it not to be, reminds me of late 90's early 2000's teen movies.",/review/rw8608192/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2022,m-47826,1," I Can't honestly give this movie more stars...
","They just ruined everything with that ending. At one point I thought the woke aspect was just a way to show how pathetic and gullible these characters were. But they built the whole morale of the story around it. And it destroyed everything I enjoyed about it earlier. Sarah Michelle Gellar's cameo was wasted on this movie. That is basically a feminist tale, trying to capitalize on the 90s nostalgia, with cool songs of that time, that sound too random to appreciate in the plot. Camilla Mendes is another shade of Veronica Lodge, and Maya Hawke is gawky with her over the top acting and facial expressions. There may have been some good ideas, but writers were too busy providing a « message », they forgot about writing something that sticks. And will be remembered in a week.",/review/rw8608192/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2022,owenpont-70803,8," 90s film made nowadays...........
","I enjoyed this quite a lot. Both actresses did a great job. The script was entertaining, and the comedy was good. It felt like one big nostalgia trip for anyone who liked films like Mean Girls. I loved the twist they pulled at the end of the film though, it made the film more memorable and kept it original while being nostalgic. I do think it has a little bit of a long runtime and I don't think everything gets resolved. It kind of just ends. But overall, I think this was a fun, funny and entertaining high school comedy. And I think people who like these kind of films will like this one without a doubt.",/review/rw8608192/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2022,jpismyname,8," Fun, entertaining
","How I miss high school movies. Haven't watched one in quite a long time, so this is refreshing. I actually really like this movie. It's about two high school students in a posh school who do revenge by going after one another's bullies.",/review/rw8608192/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,atlastu2,5," Stop casting people in their 20s to play high school teens
","I wanted to write this review, not to talk about the film itself, but the fact that the two lead actresses are in their 20s playing girls in high school, which is happening a lot in all the teen films these days, and honestly it ruins the whole experience. I just need to understand why this happens, i mean there are new talents discovered everyday, why do film producers feel the need to cast much older actors for roles that are clearly not right for them. I didn't really enjoy that film, didn't identify or sympathize with anyone in it. It had way too many twists and unrealistic things, so it stopped making sense to me. But i did like the soundtrack. One more thing this film is way too long for a teen comedy, I mean two hours, come one.",/review/rw8608192/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,trimblecali,9," Modern day Heathers
","This movie is campy and fun. Reminded me a lot of a modern day Heathers. Yet it still feel original, which is rare to come across nowadays. It could have easily been corny but everything really works. Once I saw it was written and directed by the same person who made Someone Great, I knew it would be good. There's a twist halfway which I wasn't expecting. It changes the tone pretty quickly and feels like a different movie after that point. All the acting is fantastic (Camila Mendes, Maya Hawke, Austin Abrams) and everyone plays their role to a T. The music is also fantastic. Definitely recommend this!",/review/rw8608192/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2023,RahulM007,9," Fun, stylish, and brimming with youthful energy
","A fun, energetic, vibrant, and chaotic revenge story with a stellar cast and a jaw dropping twist. Camila Mendes and Maya Hawke have a great rapport and work extremely well in their respective roles as Drea and Eleanor. Throughout the movie, I found myself relating to the characters. The film is surprisingly enjoyable, relatable, and quotable. I did not expect it would turn out the way it did. Alas, my expectations were quickly subverted. The cherry on top is that most of the cast comes from a popular film or television franchise. Sarah Michelle Geller portrayed the Headmaster in the movie but is widely known as Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Camila Mendes currently stars in Riverdale, while Maya Hawke appears in Stranger Things. Maia Reficco played a minor part in the movie, and also appears in Pretty Little Liars: Original Sin. It was fun and unexpected to see Game of Thrones alum Sophie Turner pop up on the screen. Alisha Boe as Tara also appeared in the Netflix series 13 Reasons Why. And finally, Rish Shah portrayed Russ in the movie, but can be recognized as the actor who played Kamran in Ms. Marvel. These are only the actors I recognized whilst watching the movie, and I reckon that there a few more from popular films and television shows. Anyway, Do Revenge is a rompous, and uplifting coming-of-age story elevated by ravishing performances from Camila Mendes and Maya Hawke. I loved the bubble-gum aesthetic of the whole movie. The exuberant colours and youthful soundtrack gave the film a wholesome and comfy (pun intended) feeling. Some aspects of the movie hit me on an emotional level. The producers, writers, actors, and everyone involved in the making of this movie should receive all the praise and accolades that they can get. Do Revenge is one of the best teen movies of the past decade. It is fun, inventive, bold, elegant, stylish, and brimming with youthful energy. Plus, it includes a bunch of clever pop culture references, similar to Riverdale. I will probably be thinking and raving about this movie for weeks. Can't wait to rewatch it.",/review/rw8608192/?ref_=tt_urv

","This was your typical high school garbage...why why why? Completely unnecessary. Where are all these HS's where everyone is so over the top?! It's so fantastical. Who is relating to this? The story is all over the place - double crossing, they're good, they're not good anymore, they're good again. Convoluted. Explain to me again how she lost her Yale scholarship?! Flimsy premise. All this due to kids being jerks at a camp when they were little.",/review/rw8608192/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2022,Tweekums,8," A solid, violence-free teen revenge movie
","This film is set in Rosehill Country Day High School, in Miami. Drea is a popular pupil who is attending on a scholarship and expects to proceed smoothly to Yale when school is over. As her senior year begins everything starts to go wrong. She allows her boyfriend, popular student Max, to film them having sex and somewhat inevitably the video leaks. She blames him and punches him... she is punished while everybody rallies round 'Poor Max'. One day, after Drea's car fails to start, she gets a lift from new girl Eleanor. They get talking and Eleanor reveals that she too has somebody who wronged her at the school. It isn't long before the two of them are plotting revenge; to enable them to get close to their targets they swap victims and set about exposing them. Of course not everything goes to plan and there are surprising secrets to be revealed before the story is fully played out.",/review/rw8608192/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2022,Shefhammer,1," Drivel
","Badly acted. Appallingly written. Complete and utter drivel from start to finish. They put 25 different ideas I to a blender and came out with this absolute train-wreck of a movie. The plot and tone of the movie veer violently from sentence to sentence, let alone scene to scene. Character motivations are non existent, nothing is real, the acting is absolutely atrocious - I know I said that already but it bears repeating. Do yourself a favor and skip this utter bore-fest. I think the budget went mainly on the soundtrack, which is quite good, but everything else is inept and I honestly think this is one of the worst things I have ever seen.",/review/rw8608192/?ref_=tt_urv
