17 September 2019,christophersarles,10," Bring it BACK! I'll never watch your network again!
","It was great! Can't believe you ripped us off with that ending. It will be a long time, maybe NEVER before I get involved in another show on your network!",/review/rw8115504/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2015,blanbrn,8," Not your typical royal family instead it's life of wild times, sex and blunt and provocative ways!
","Been watching this new series the very first one ever made for the E! network and I must say ""The Royals"" does deliver! True this probably is not how the typical royal family acts in England, but still this series is feel good feel free fun! The series no matter how good is fiction and it has plenty of family drama as it follows the times of this British royal family not just thru London, but thru the world of their travels! And even though this family tries to keep tradition they have plenty of their own vices from heavy drinking to having a lot of sex! True keeping the price of fame is a royal job all together while facing public scrutiny! Anyway the real eye candy treat is seeing the still hot and beautiful Elizabeth Hurley play the cougar type Queen Helena! Mrs. Hurley anytime I see her it's such an eye candy treat as she is the wings and shoulders of this series! So check out ""The Royals"" it's a feel good time and it's good to see Mrs. Elizabeth in a series.",/review/rw8115504/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2019,cravalhog,10," I NEED closure
","I loved this series from episode 1. My guilty pleasure. Recently got to re-watch the entire series thanks to Amazon Prime. But...I need closure. Season 4, and final season, left me hanging. So many questions and no answers. When I found out the Royals was not renewed for season 5, I was in disbelief. Please finish this series E! Even if just a few short episodes, which is impossible, considering all that was left up in the air at the conclusion of season 4. Give us something, it can't end...with no ending.",/review/rw8115504/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2015,jamesrcunliffe,9," Humorous - brats with money and power
","I've enjoyed every minute thus far. The writing is witty and while at times predictable, it's a real laugh to watch the kids get even or get back at those that cross them. ",/review/rw8115504/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2017,despina-petrovska,10," Second opinion - i love it
","I must admit when i saw the first episode i was thinking to stop watching because it seams to me like some terribly show whit all this first page sex scandals, princes whit drug addiction, prince who sleep whit employee. But i give a second chance, and i was surprise that i actually love this show. I love all the drama that it going on there. I love the characters especial Prince Liam , Jasper, The King Simon. Some may say that this is an waste of time show, whit no story, but i can assure you that there is a story, about love (between Jasper and Eleanor),about family (between Liam and Eleanor), about power (between Cyrus and Helena), and about honesty no matter what ( King Simon ) . It is a nice show , whit a good story, good actress, and a message to chose love every time , because the power will just destroy us . So this is why i love this show and i'm looking forward for new episode and a new season i hope . Enjoy",/review/rw8115504/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2021,michelle_kummer,10," Bring the Royals back!
","Surely someone has to buy this show, it's far better than most of the crap these days!
I was reluctant to watch it at first, but within the first 15 mins I was hooked. I love every character, they are cast perfectly. The love affair between Eleanor and Jasper is beautiful, although in real life a princess could never dress so provocatively and behave that way I am sure the other stuff goes on behind closed doors. I love Liz Hurley so gracious and beautiful! Liam is a sweetheart and King Simon shouldn't have been killed. This is similar to Dynasty just a royal version and it's a shame it's been cancelled.
I tried Bridgerton that was absolute rubbish and somehow had high ratings so please everyone watch this and demand it comes back.",/review/rw8115504/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2015,skyewashburn,10," love
","this show is the cherry on top of my weekend after a long week. Absolutely love the over the top writing. Sometimes there is a need to escape the reality of carpools,sports,bedtime stories etc and consume yourself with some good ""not so"" old fashioned fun. With so much violence and negative/repetitive 24/7 news, this show is refreshing. Too much political correctness these days. Hoping for a season 2 with just as much scandalous antics and drug and sex fueled episodes that are far from the royal reality. My four children know that mom is not to be interrupted for one hour on Sunday evenings. At the end of the show I come back to the real world and kiss my children goodnight. If The Royals does not get picked up for a second season, well, FML. ha",/review/rw8115504/?ref_=tt_urv

18 March 2015,cho_chang_ph,8," Unusual take for a fictional modern Royal Family drama

3 February 2017,marcusdestorm,9," A Very British Royal Affair
","From the outset, the whole encompass of The Royals, is that the real Royals of Great Britain are nothing like The Hensdridge Family, who are more dysfunctional in their reign than the Windsors. However, putting a breath of fresh air into the scripted series, it isn't long before the choosing of a favorite character begins to take.",/review/rw8115504/?ref_=tt_urv

16 May 2022,sagaleyonberg,7," They need to make a season 5
",I really liked the show! It was a lot of drama and cliffhangers which made you constantly want to continue watching. I'm just so angry with how it ended. They have to make a season 5 because it's not okey to end a show like that.,/review/rw8115504/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2015,bjarias,7," ..definitely benefits from multiple episode viewing
","This might be for many a tough one to get into right out of the box. But once you wade through a couple-three episodes you know pretty much what you're getting yourself into... and it actually gets somewhat better as time goes by. And possibly by the end of S1, you just might find yourself surprisingly looking forward to S2. The casting job is top notch.. as are the performances of most all the actors. There is a flavor here for most everyone, and the ones worth looking at.. are really worth looking at (notably Poppy Corby-Tuech.. she's just absolutely gorgeous)! Is it well over the top.. undoubtedly.. and that's exactly the point. Actually, looking at what they are trying to accomplish is nowhere near easy.. and yet they pull the majority of it off pretty darn well. Doesn't always pay off, but sometimes hanging in there gives just reward.",/review/rw8115504/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2015,sweety_pi,7," Oddly amusing; total kitsch.
",It's kind of painful to watch with the pop music underscore. I wonder if it's more painful to watch for a British citizen or an American? I wouldn't write it off just yet. There are some subtle actions and dialog that make it interesting. Can people be so on/off with their feelings and behavior? How can I get ten lines out of this? Of course the settings are beautiful. Almost there. I wonder if the writers will handle the question of funding the ongoing Royal lifestyle versus the private wealth that they hold. All sorts of other interesting aristocrats to add to the mix. Can they make the commoners interesting? They can also handle royal privilege versus duty versus common privilege and duty.,/review/rw8115504/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2019,xecute-1,9," Loved this show
","It's witty, glamorous, vengeful, satirical and there's some serious heart warming and sad moments. Joan Collins and Liz Hurley make a great mother and daughter, ooh those catty lines. It's hilarious and then heart wrenching. Such a pity it was cancelled, please will some studio pick this up.... Netflix...... anyone?",/review/rw8115504/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2015,mkhyde,9," love it; brilliant
","As Canadians, we love to hate the British monarch. I've watched 2 episodes of The Royals and found the writing to be brilliant. Yes, it's a cheesy, campy satire that pokes fun of everything we hate about the monarchy which makes the show loads of fun. So far, the show 'captures' all of the gossip, innuendos and life events of the real royals. My mother was a devout royal watcher so I'm aware of the similarities between the show and the real royal family. If you weren't so aware of these events/gossip, the show wouldn't have as much meaning. The actors are spot on to their ''real life' counterparts AND I can't believe they found an actress to play Eliz. Hurley's daughter who looks exactly like her! I'm holding out giving the show 9 stars as I wait and see if they can keep going with the brilliant writing (they certainly have enough 'real life' royal debauchery situations to write about).",/review/rw8115504/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2019,fyrt,10," Amazing show!
",I was hooked on this show!!! Why would they cancel a show and leave us hanging like that? We need a season 5 at least to give us a proper ending!,/review/rw8115504/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2019,nivetham-36250,6," Guilty Pleasure
",Fictionalized soapy drama. Its funny and interesting to watch what a modern and scandalous royal family would be. Sometimes the plot has ulterior motives and you really can't judge a character if they are good or bad. Acting could have been better at few places. It's a shame that it didn't live to see 5th season.,/review/rw8115504/?ref_=tt_urv

29 July 2015,starrymoon-77635,10," Guilty pleasure all the way!
","It's just a guilty pleasure! it's not ground breaking television, or acting, but it's great! Very entertaining, decent story line, lots of drama, & hot people. It's the type of mind numbing television that you can enjoy to help escape the stress of work, and real life. Highly enjoyable, there's occasional good music, and just fun to watch! Elizabeth H. Makes a pretty good queen of England, and the prince and princess' characters are interesting and have entertaining story lines. It's a short season, only 10 episodes, and they all come together nicely in the end. Helps set things nicely for the next season. Really like this show & can't wait for the season 2! I would recommend giving it a shot :)",/review/rw8115504/?ref_=tt_urv
