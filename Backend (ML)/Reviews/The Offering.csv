","I thought this would be a cool mix of The Autopsy of Jane Doe and The Vigil, but this movie completely missed the marked. This wasn't even half as good as either of those films.",/review/rw8806583/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2023,sacdalysimon,8," Better than the 5.2 it has of time of review
","I dont understand the low score , i throughly enjoyed this and so did my wife, it is a bit old school in its vibe which i liked and the effects were ok for what it is, plenty or folke lore, Demon stuff, pentagrams and creepy children.",/review/rw8806583/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 2022,LarryBeard77,," A deep, mystical rollercoaster ride
","Saw this film at an early screening, was really surprised to find en emotionally charged studio horror film w a lot of heart wrapped in barbed wire. This film makes you scream out loud, cry at certain moments, and even laugh. The end packs a sick twist and I'm very curious to see how horror fans dissect it. There were a couple moments that perhaps leaned a bit too hard on jumpscares but overall you can really feel the genuine love and care from its filmmakers. I wasn't going to leave a review but after the q&a I realized this film is much deeper than i realized and so wanted to pay my respects. Special mention to Game of Throne's Paul Kaye who just killed it!",/review/rw8806583/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,FilmFanatic2023,7," A Strong Genre Alternative with a Culturally Resonant Voice
","Oliver Park's ""The Offering"" is a surprisingly strong genre alternative on one of the most crowded Friday the 13th release dates for horror fans in years. The film has echoes of religious horror like ""The Omen"" and family horror like ""Hereditary,"" but it also has its own culturally resonant voice due to the heavily Jewish story it tells. The setting of a funeral home adds to the eerie atmosphere and the cinematography is impressive despite some missteps. The performances are a mixed bag, with the older actors delivering stronger performances than the younger ones. However, the film's script is cluttered and the several endings are a bit of a fumble. Overall, ""The Offering"" is an atmospheric horror film that makes me excited about what this filmmaker has to offer in the future.",/review/rw8806583/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2023,Tweetienator,5," Offers Enough
","Someone looking for character development in a horror movie is, well, searching in the wrong place, I dare to say. The Offering is a solid entry, not one of the best nor one of the worst movies of that kind - black magic, possession, demons. Of course, we watched everything The Offering offers (pun intended) many times but there is some solid production and solid acting provided, and, last but not least, I like that the movie is settled in the Jewish belief system and culture, which adds a certain special flavor to the story. Not too bad and if you like movies a la Insidious, The Possession, The Other Side of the Door and so on, you may get just a decent snack in between on your plate. Exact rate: 4.5.",/review/rw8806583/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,josephbannister,8," Has an old fashioned feel.. but is not generic
",Tbh this has to be one of the first movies based on demonology that didn't bore me bor did it over do any segment of violence . Rather it left more to the imagination and I find that is what a lot of today horror films lack and why the classics are considered classics. It left more to our imagination to uncover and piece together. There are quite a few jump scares the couple in the aisle next me were rather on the squeamish side. But overall give this movie a chance.. if you've seen and eighth for silver or under its American title the cursed from 2021 you will very much enjoy this film. The atmosphere is the same very ominous. Overall I give it an 8 out of 10.,/review/rw8806583/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2023,adani-61434,7," Finally a good story &nd al little Thriller effect
","This is the first film in a long time with a deep story. It incorporates traditional storylines so that marrying an infidel and the modernization of Jewish culture. This I think is a big plus. Such storylines are rare in this type of movies. Furthermore, there is also emotion at the death of the father after which it becomes clear that the document was signed after all. The thriller-like moments with tension building are also much appreciated. This too is often missed in nowadays horror films. The normal abrupt ending of horror films nowadays was also very much unlike this one. It is often the case that there are still 100 questions left open about certain roles at the end of the film that 99 times out of 100 just ends badly. The endings of all the parts in this movie were clear. The appearance of the demon in this film was below par though. This is also the only flaw I have to note about this film anno 2022. Perhaps a good recommendation would have been to use the dead man in the woman's dream as a further demon appearance as well. I see an opening for part two.",/review/rw8806583/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,giovanninehmeofficial,8," Good for loosing weight
","I rated high only because I've shed all the calories taken from popcorn, I liked the movie as it is intended to be for a horror movie... it has very good effects and music so that's why it was a good idea watching it at the movie... I liked the idea that all people in the cinema were so quiet and no one happened to say anything afraid that will die. It's a new kind of horror story with a blend of exorcism. You have to watch it but make sure you hide with someone else and don't watch all the scenes: the fun fact that the demonizing expulsion is built into our memory since we were very young thanks.",/review/rw8806583/?ref_=tt_urv

",This is a movie that I didn't know much about. I saw that it was playing at the Gateway Film Center and that it was horror. That was enough for me to make a point to go to the theater to check this out. It also made an interesting pairing on Journey with a Cinephile: A Horror Movie Podcast.,/review/rw8806583/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2023,bertrandma,5," Generic
","An utterly generic skeleton (Near-Eastern poltergeist, Victorian house, first encounter with spouse's family, etc.) dressed up with a little Jewish folklore. Sets and costumes are decent, and the acting seems OK. But it is ill served by poor writing, resulting in a cast of either clueless (the prego wife, the dad) or detestable (the son and his brother), poor rhythm and a great many visual clichés. To make maximum room for their mediocre creature and its run-of-the-mill jump scares, the few original ideas are left unexploited: the set, a Hasidic funeral parlour, is largely reduced to its mortuary basement, and the rich Jewish folklore only yield here generic pentagrams and shiny crystal necklaces.",/review/rw8806583/?ref_=tt_urv

28 January 2023,skylacraig-28735,4," Absolutely horrific
",The description brings the viewer's false hope this film is terrible urgent need of character development and the plot needs to be explained in a lot more detail and the idea of the whole spirit/demon thing needs to be explained. At the beginning the film came up with an descriptive quote on the spirit that says it's a women when in fact it's actually a deer looking thing that has long hair terrible idea of a female villain. The Jewish speaking men brought in the whole idea of religion demons but could hardly hear it understand what they were saying and to put subtitles on to actually watch it.,/review/rw8806583/?ref_=tt_urv
