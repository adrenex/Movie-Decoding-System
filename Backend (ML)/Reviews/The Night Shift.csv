","Were you wondering what went on? What the characters endured between movie number one and this sequel? Wonder no more - because the answer(s) lie here. Now I understand that some felt underwhelmed with this effort, but I actually thought this had a head start (if you've seen the first movie). Starts off quite incredible and with a rush. And also gives our leads some air to breathe in certain scenes (and the love-hate relationship still works perfectly).",/review/rw3081403/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2019,dworldeater,8," The boys are back in town
","48 Hours is in a class of its own,although Another 48 Hours is not quite as good, it still is a worthy follow up to the 1st film. Much like the 1st this is essentially an urban western where Jack Cates and Reggie Hammond reunite to face a common foe in the concrete jungle. Eddie Murphy is still on top of his game and really funny and Nolte is still convincing as a bad ass cop. The story is pretty good, but I would love to see the film as it was originally intended before the studio cut it before its theatrical release. As far as the buddy cop/action comedy genre, Another 48 Hours still is one of the best and gets the job done for fast,furious and action packed entertainment. My only real critique of the film is the actor who played Ganz's brother is kind of weak compared to James Remar's performance in the 1st film. Even so, Walter Hill did a great job of putting this together and I still really enjoy this classic.",/review/rw3081403/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2004,Captain_Couth,7," Revenge of the 80's: The sequel!
","Another 48 Hrs. (1990) was another sequel. During the 80's any movie that made the slightest of profits made a sequel. For one reason only, to make even more money. However many producers never made another dime off of the momentum of the previous film and were stuck with a sequel that cost two or three times as much as the original film, Another 48 Hrs. was a prime example. The only reason films that produced multiple sequels raked in the dough was the films were cheaply made, low overhead means more potential for a profit. When you pour millions into a movie and expect to make a buck, two out of three times you're going to lose your shirt. ",/review/rw3081403/?ref_=tt_urv

10 May 2005,smatysia,6," Half-sequel, half-remake
","I agree with most of the past commentators. This film is a half-sequel, half-remake. So many elements were simply copied from the original film. I'm sure the filmmakers considered this homage, but it comes off as a lack of ideas. And we won't even go into the monumental plot holes. Gigantic plot holes. Brobdingnagian plot holes. And while I hadn't previously noted the enormous amount of glass breaking, until reading the comments, yes, I'd have to say they made it more or less a motif of the film. Murphy and Nolte did reasonably well resurrecting their respective characters, and there were some truly funny moments, and truly snappy repartee. But it's not enough to save this one. If you liked the original film (and who didn't) you should probably see this one, just don't have high expectations for it.",/review/rw3081403/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2008,GOWBTW,9," A new adventure begins!
","Here we go again! Jack Cates(Nick Nolte) and Reggie Hammond(Eddie Murphy) are back together, only this time, the things get more extreme. In ""Another 48 Hours"", Cates and Hammond go after a man known only as th ""Ice Man"". Not only that, there's an inside man in the police force helping him out. Things go bad for Hammond when his car gets blown away, was shot at when he was in the prison bus. What's even worse, one of the killers is the brother of Ganz(The killer from the first movie who stole Cates' gun). Unlike the first one, there were some biker action. I liked the part when the biker went right through the movie screen. Anyone could mistake that for 3D. There was more shooting. This one has a little more carnage than the first I should say. It was funny when Reggie finally took the lighter from Cates after he was shot. Nothing seems to change in that movie, the fun factor was still there, and the comedy was there as well. Enjoy! 4 out of 5 stars!",/review/rw3081403/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2014,videorama-759-859391,7," Another much more action filled 48 hours
","Seven years on, a wearied Nolte, hair cropped and the lively sidekick, Murphy re team in this bigger action spectacle. While the original was more restrained, and did take a while to get to where it's going, this however surprisingly much more entertaining, as if the start is anything to go back. Apparently Nolte and Murphy, are in an avenging fire, as Gain's brother wants retribution, and we know Nolte, never losing his character, isn't gonna go down easy. Nolte enlist Murphy's help to catch this angry son of a bitch, and of course he's reluctant as first until Nolte tries blackmailing tactics on him. Murphy who is almost is free as a bird takes up with Nolte after assassination attempts are made on him. Now the angry and avenging return fire and this is where the fun of the movie lies. Even if not liking the original, which was more solid, atmospheric and hard edged, and of better quality, here's one you'll like more with racey punchy action, with an end, very much similar to the original, plus a shock turn involving one of Nolte's very own from the original, which I liked.",/review/rw3081403/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2002,ken_vandenbussche,," Mind the word: another!
","It's a good thing that director Walter Hill has waited 8 years before making a sequel of the original ""48 hrs.""  If he had released this film immediately after the first one, it would have become a flop.  The reason is because both films are very much alike.  ""Another 48 hrs."" hasn't got anything new to offer; it's an almost exact copy of the first one.  And that's precisely why they waited so long before making this sequel.",/review/rw3081403/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2008,johnnyboyz,6," Shows its age due to time but Another 48 Hrs. is still an entertaining and action packed yarn that will quench any buddy thirst you might have.
","Another 48 Hrs. feels like a missed opportunity; it feels as if the makers have recognised the potential of the idea and have done half a job. This is because it never really elevates itself above the material it actually is. At a time when the Lethal Weapon films had proved there was a demand for white cop with black sidekick buddy combination type films, Another 48 Hrs. is perhaps a cash in sequel to a film that was never anything special any way. Where as it sounds like I'm being negative, the film was enjoyable for what it was and that said; I would have a hard time in deciding which one I liked more.",/review/rw3081403/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2017,TheOneThatYouWanted,7," Back at it again with those vans
","I watched this on the heels of watching the first film. Honestly, both films are great. I think this sequel gets so much hate because the first film is just that much better. Make no mistake about it, this movie is a shameless cash grab. But it does a great job of entertaining you with outstanding action and a few laughs. The film is about the odd couple of a beat cop and criminal teaming up yet again to take on some bad dudes. This film fails in that it focuses too much on the bad guys and not enough on the stars of the film. I'm guessing because Eddie Murphy was a huge star at that point and didn't have the time to hangout and shoot more scenes or whatever. And because of that, the film is slightly cheapen. But still worth watching if you enjoy action flicks. Some of the action in this film is jaw dropping but cheapened by overexposing the villains without developing them with dialogue and etc. But whatever, it is a great grind house film posing as a late 80s blockbuster.",/review/rw3081403/?ref_=tt_urv

",To many people another 48 hours is a like a remake of the original. I can see why they would think so. many of the scenes are just like the ones in the first movie. However I believe it had a new plot being to catch a mysterious criminal known as the Iceman. I thought it had a great twist on who was the main bad guy after all. The end shootout was one of the best in the action movie history. There were also some good comedy scenes between Murphy and Nolte. Andrew Divoff does good as Ganz brother. Murphy's scene in the bar however is bad and does not even come close to the original. In my opinion this was a good action/comedy sequel to a classic original.,/review/rw3081403/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2007,patrickmercie66,8," Great entertainment.
","I have to admit this film has a 'Have I met you before' feeling to it. But then most sequels do. Same characters, same personalities leads to some of the stuff being same-ish. Yet I ask you, how many people do you know that drastically change overnight? Not that many. So the same characters having the same reactions and habits to similar situations is not that far fetched. Hill Street Blues characters didn't change that much either yet it stayed entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The acting is of a very high quality and so are some of the action scenes. And there is a twist in the film I didn't see coming. So all in all, not a classic yet highly entertaining, and that is what it was supposed to do.",/review/rw3081403/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 1998,Cal-5,," A good and funny follow-up to the original
","Another 48 HRS. is good for one reason and one reason only, Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy's chemistry together. They work off each other perfectly. This film is not interested in telling a story, it is a mere stage for these two actors to showcase their talent. The film only works when these two are on -screen. When Murphy and Nolte are not on-screen, the film is rather boring. This can be credited to the fact that Nolte and Murphy are so fun to watch that you don't care at all about the rest of characters. Fortunately, Nolte and Murphy are on-screen more than 90% of the time.",/review/rw3081403/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I was little and saw the first 48 Hours, I thought Eddie Murphy looked pretty scrawny in that suit and that, upon seeing the sequel, he looked a lot more fashionable. Then I realized he was wearing the same suit throughout this movie (I guess he was in a lot better shape). Other than considering this film to be a fairly entertaining rehash of the first, I guess that's my review.",/review/rw3081403/?ref_=tt_urv

10 September 2004,tfrizzell,," A Faceless Clock of Old and Dry Ideas.
",Really more of a remake than a sequel as the similarities between this installment and the original eight years earlier are mind-blowing. Once again Nick Nolte is a San Francisco cop who gets convict Eddie Murphy out of prison a little early so they can stop a deviant group of criminals. This time they are after a mysterious mastermind drug kingpin who has a staggering network of thugs (mainly motorcycle) who do his bidding. And of course none of the bad guys even know who their boss is. No creativity turns this into a sequel that was just made for monetary purposes. The idea was only somewhat successful as the box office business paled in comparison with its predecessor. Critically the picture is almost a total waste. 2 stars out of 5.,/review/rw3081403/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2006,sklose32,8," Not as good as the first, but still entertaining
","The Movie begins with a meeting of a few bikers. Then a some cops arrive and get killed. (who could have guessed). Then you see a racetrack where some money-exchange is taking place. After a shootout between a guy and Jack Cates (Nick Nolte). There is a little explosion but they don't find the other guys gun. So Jack is in big problems because he is likely to be charged with manslaughter. Jack visits Reggie (Eddie Murphy) in prison and tells him that he only gets his money (which Jack stored for him) if he helps him. Reggie gets really mad. BTW: Reggie says he was in prison for 7 years which gets explained later. Because in Part 1 they always talked about (I think) just a few (like 2 or so, but don't hold me to that) years. Oh and on of the bikers, who are supposed to kill Reggie is the brother of the bad guy in the first movie. Well, Reggie gets out of the Prison and is on his bus. while that happens there is an attempt on Jack's Life. Because he is on the search for a ominous Drugdealer called :The Iceman. (BTW: I missed something before: Reggie was in his cell alone and singing to his James Brown tape. Looks exactly as it did in Part one. When the movie came out, I read that this Scene was put in to compensate Eddie Murphies Wishes. But it was funny one time. The second time it looks kinda out of place.). All that happens in the first 10 minutes of the movie. So you can imagine that there is a lot of action in this movie. After a while they get to be good buddies during the movie again. It's very similar to the first movie. And a lot of scenes are kind of just copied from the first one (I mean storywise) Since Walter Hill had 8 Years to come up with a new and entertaining and sometimes funny story. But the movie just hasn't the charm of the first movie. Though if you enjoy either Eddie Murphy or Nick Nolte You'll like it I will not spoil the rest of the movie for you if you haven't seen it yet and tell you who the iceman is. Now it get's explained why Reggie was in the Can longer. He was framed for illegal money possession in Jail. Since Jack doesn't give Reggie his Money they have to work together, and Reggie isn't happy about it. Nobody from the Force believes Jack about the ""Iceman""... Well the story develops as you might think.. They go through a lot and become good buddies again. I am watching the Movie right now. The revelation who the ""Iceman"" is, that is the only real surprise in this movie, the rest is real predictable. Well it's a typical ""Buddie Movie"" as they did back then (like from the middle 80ties to the beginning of the nineties)... like the first Lethal Weapon Movie. First the two don't like each other and during the movie they become best friends.(It's sad that they, for the most part, don't make 'em like this anymore).. If you like these kinds of movies you will like this one.. I like them from back when they were new, so I still do. But if you are used to Movie like they make 'em today , I really don't know if you will enjoy it. But it is a pretty good movie. Watch it and decide for yourself. And if you haven't seen Part 1 (48 Hours) get that one too. O.K. I will watch the rest of the movie now and enjoy myself. One last thing: I really think, the movie is worth 7 out of 10 points.",/review/rw3081403/?ref_=tt_urv

","When the two ""48 Hours"" movies were made, there were a few people who had mobile communications. But not like it is now. If I had a dog, he or she would mope around until the dog had their own cellular, or internet. Hammond was in a phone booth, trying to borrow money. Now, telephone booths are rare. Yet, with cellular still in the future, Reggie Hammond had bought himself a Porsche he bought with money he made in crime. His Porsche had a special key with a computer chip, a common sight now when people are tweeting their cars. Hammond tweeted his Porsche into a thousand pieces. Don't you love cinema pyrotechnics?

8 August 2018,travis36,7," Not your typical 80's sequel
",Usually a sequel in the 80's to a great movie tanked but this one actually was better than the original. The action was constant and flowed quickly. I read that the original run time was cut quite a bit by the studio and many of the supporting cast had reduced screen time. Nolte was great and continued his original character. Murphy definitely took over as first billed and was a much more dominant lead character. The plot had a continued story from the original that made it interesting. The laughs were good and another great soundtrack. The only con was some of the gunfights had bullets flying everywhere but everyone was missing.,/review/rw3081403/?ref_=tt_urv

","A rehash of the first one, but still a poignant, gripping story that glues you to your seat from the start to the finish. This cast interacts with absolute precision, whether walking around a room or interrupting each others' wisecracks. The script and direction meld into a strong movie. What's best is that not one character ever withdraws tongue from cheek. I found the acting to be sensational, the dialogue incredible and the director's abilities to be up to par and then some. It reminds me of some of those sombre German films that were popular back in the 1990s. An awesome, good surprise for me this little movie was, so that I highly recommend it.
