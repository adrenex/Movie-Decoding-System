19 June 2005,NickMeron,7," Fun to watch, if you do not make a big deal out of technical accuracy.
","Very entertaining action, once you get past the ""believability"" problems, i.e., terrorists getting on the plane at all, the plane having an on-board armory, Secret Service agents' inability to shoot accurately, etc.",/review/rw0402402/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2019,ironhorse_iv,7," This motion picture takes flight! Is it worth watching? Yes, it's an entertaining movie! It's my wingman.
","Made in the aftermath of the Cold War & pre 9/11 world, director Wolfgang Petersen's ""Die Hard"" inspired thriller 'Air Force One' indeed flew high with both audience members & critics. Most of them like the motion picture about a U.S president James Marshall (Harrison Ford) attempt to retake his plane after a group of terrorists led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) hijack it. I can see why, as most of the action pieces were truly enjoyable. For example, the shoot outs and brawling stunt work were choreography very well even if the opening palace storming scene backdrop certainly didn't look like it took place in Kazakhstan, but in Cleveland, Ohio. Despite that, you can tell a lot of hard work went into the action; as Ford himself did most of his own stunts. He really did take some stiff punches from Gary Oldman. Besides his character's very important title, he look believable as the regular everyman forced into surreal situations to rise to heroism. While, yes, the Commander in Chief in this film had some value past military training. His present middle aged body was not bulked up to take the punishment. He got tired, hurt and damage as the film went on. There are parts in the film where he get easily capture or make a dumb decision or mistake. Because of that, Ford made for a great reluctant hero. It's just too bad that his character seem a bit one dimensional. After all, it seem like Ford was playing over righteous jingoism version of himself minus his flying skills. I can hardly remember anything much about James Marshall. If anything, the first time I saw this, I thought he was playing Jack Ryan again in another Tom Clancy adaptation. Regardless of that, some of the action scenes not involving much of him being presence were a little bit disappointing. After all, how in the hell does fighter jets not be able to shoot down a giant Boeing 747 out of the sky!? It's make no sense. To add to that some of plane explosions in the film look highly awkward dated and fake looking, especially the water landing. The idea that Air Force One has no automatic landing capability is silly. All Boeing 747s have the capability to land on auto pilot. It doesn't take an aviator genius to know that. Anyway, Major Caldwell (William H. Macy) does have the ability to fly it. After all, in order to gain his rank, he has to log at least 3,000 flight hours in an aircraft. So the whole third act escape seem a bit add on. Despite that, I did find the KC-10 Extender scene pretty cool to watch; along with the getaway from Ramstein Air Base even if the airplane being able to turn quickly with ease or fly up without flaps within a short distance was a bit unrealistic. It's non-existence like the real plane having an escape pod or parachute lift. Nevertheless all of these scenes are a lot better than the moments involving the Vice President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close). I found the whole White House sequences to be irritating. All the 25th Amendment talk was too much. It made the film muddled with endless filler amount of unneeded political clicking & debate. It got so bad, I felt like I was watching CSPAN. They really made her look very weak by having her work with the terrorists' demands & being pushed around from U.S. Defense Secretary Walter Dean (Dean Stockwell). At least, the filmmakers didn't have her breakdown and cry like the original script from Andrew Marlowe ask for. The film is already making women figureheads look disfavor enough by having the guys play with her emotions. Honestly the time spent with her should had been used to explain the mole reasons for betraying his crew. Without it, the whole heel turn seem very confusing. Its sucks because the premise of the movie is heavily tied to the geopolitics of the mid to late 90's. Yet the film didn't explore too much of his history. Nevertheless I did like how the other villain in the flick, Korshunov felt more fully dimensional than a standard stereotypical smug evil foreigner. Gary Oldman plays him as realistic human being to the hilt. He really got to shine at times. There are certain moments in the film where the terrorist brings up a pretty good point about US policies. In particular, how the president is also a killer. Although the somber and patriotic score quickly written in 12 days by composer Jerry Goldman did make the Commander in Chief actions seem more heroic than the villain. While, the soundtrack is beautiful to listen to, the film did force feed it down our throats to the point that the music came across as a bit extreme chauvinism for my taste. It got so bad that in 2016, Presidential candidate businessman Donald Trump use the music for his bid for the White House. Regardless, it's still a good soundtrack. A lot better than original composer Randy Newman's score for sure; which Newman reused for 2010 animation film 'Toy Story 3'. In the end, overall: 'Air Force One' truly is one of the most popular action films of the 1990s. It's one film worth flying over to go see. Highly recommended.",/review/rw0402402/?ref_=tt_urv

3 August 1999,bat-5,8," Great adventure
","Air Force One is one great ride.  What makes it work so well is the conviction that Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman bring to their roles.  You can see in each actor's eyes that they stand behind what they believe in.  Gary Oldman makes a perfect villian and a very complex one at that.  He is not just an average, run of the mill madman.  He has a family, he is someone's son and those facts make him that much more real.  Harrison Ford is great as the president.  He's strong, quick witted, and will do anything he can to save his family and staff from the hijackers.

","A very clichéd but interesting film with a two-fisted President of the United States (Harrison Ford) literally taking on terrorism himself on board his jet, Air Force One. Believable? Of course not, but it's an story that hooks you in and keeps you involved all the way. It could have been trimmed down, to be sure, but the better-than-average action scenes help make up for that. While not blatant, the film did have it's typical Hollywood Liberal slant with political correctness abounding....so be aware of that. It borders on reverse sexism and racism and there is a fair share of profanity in here if you are concerned about that. ",/review/rw0402402/?ref_=tt_urv

","Air Force One features Harrison Ford, Glenn Close, Gary Oldman, Dean Stockewell, and William H. Macy. A dream cast! In the freshest, friskiest, funniest, laugh-out-loudest comedy of the year! Cheer as President Harrison Ford takes on the baddies all by himself  ""Right now, he's our only hope"". Hiss as Dean Stockwell tries to get Glenn Close to sign away power and ""take down Air Force One"". Will she sign? Like hell! Sigh with relief when the fax machine stalls, stalls a little longer, and then just when we'd given up hope stalls a little longer, and then works! Clap like a whacked-out space cadet on class-a drugs when the fax lady parachutes to safety. Scratch your head a little when you realise that the big plot device of the bad guys having a guy on the inside is of no interest or use whatsoever. Ponder for a long time just why Gary Oldman's character doesn't just shoot the wife and the kid, for crying out loud. Marvel at the advances in special effects technology that can make a plane crash in a big budget movie look like a plane crash in a primitive video game. Thrills! Spills! Drama! Action!

","Ford and Oldman have strong performances, and the script is incredible. Unlike most action movies this film is fresh, and the Russian villains act as believable terrorists.  Too bad Ford is not the US President, I would vote for him any day.

7 September 2007,alexandermangoldt,1," America, fock yeah
","Now I admired the director Wolfgang Petersen after seeing DAS BOOT. This was a flick where I thought: Can't get any better. Of course, at the time, people obviously considered Hollywood a smart career move, but if we now take a look at Petersen's Hollywood films, I really think he should have stayed in Germany. Sure, he wouldn't have the money that he's having at his disposal now, but remember: DAS BOOT had a rather infinitesimal budget and nevertheless managed to thrill, enlighten and entertain millions of viewers. Now, what do we have: A German director who directs patriotic and nationalistic filth that invites the average American Joe to believe in the moral and military superiority of his own country. A movie that doesn't really discuss the topics at hand and divides the cast into good and evil with no shades of grey at all. There's one scene where Gary Oldman as the terrorist aboard the plane says to the president's daughter: Do you think your father is a better man because he's wearing a tie and a suit and because he uses smart bombs? I found this scene to be very interesting, however, in the film it is not dwelt upon. Instead we get Harrison Ford playing the father and leader of clean, wholesome politically America and being politically correct and charming and funny and whatnot. What's the moral of this film: God bless America and no place else.",/review/rw0402402/?ref_=tt_urv

28 September 2008,g-bodyl,10," A Great Thriller!
","Air Force One is a very good thriller. The action and suspense will be nothing to forget. This movie is about the President's plane, Air Force One being hijacked by Russian nationalists with the President on board. Now it's up to the President and the Vice-President to negotiate with the terrorists or the hostages will die. The acting in this film is pretty good. Harrison Ford did justice with his outstanding performance as the President. Gary Oldman is good as the evil terrorist. The music in this film is fabulous and patriotic considering that the score took two weeks by Jerry Goldmith to compose. I liked the effects in this film. There is nothing special, but for a film from 1997, this has good effects even though there are few. Overall, this is a good movie for everybody except for kids. This film is a moving picture with outstanding courage. My rating is 10/10.",/review/rw0402402/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2018,Leofwine_draca,7," As simple as Die Hard on a plane, and all the better for it
","AIR FORCE ONE is one of the last wave of 'DIE HARD IN A...' Hollywood flicks inspired by the Bruce Willis blockbuster, although DIE HARD rip-offs would continue in B-movie cinema for years to come (and are still being made, in fact). This film has Harrison Ford's everyman US president tackling a gang of murderous Russian terrorists who have stormed Air Force One and are willing to sacrifice the hostages for their political ends. The film is dated and more than a little cheesy in some of the sentimental scenes (the black woman on the parachute is one of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes you'll find here) and the CGI effects haven't dated too well either. Otherwise, I really enjoyed it. Wolfgang Petersen brings some of the same claustrophobia as he mined in DAS BOOT and even manages to fit Jurgen Prochnow into a little role. Ford and Michael Douglas were my favourite Hollywood thriller stars of the 1980s and 1990s and Ford does well here as the tough yet believable character. There's plenty of suspense and action throughout and the latter scenes are well staged and exciting. Gary Oldman reprises his volatile villain role from LEON to strong effect and as a whole this is an entertaining package where you can just switch off and enjoy.",/review/rw0402402/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2000,jhaggardjr,10," Exciting! Exciting! Exciting!
","""Air Force One"" is an action picture so full of excitement that it had me on the edge of my seat when I first saw it on the big screen back in 1997. This movie is one heck of a ride. Harrison Ford gives one of the best performances of his career as one U.S. President not to mess with. There are also terrific performances turned in by Glenn Close as the Vice President who deals with the terrorist's demands, and Gary Oldman in a scary piece of acting as the lead terrorist. The other actors in the movie do a good job also. In addition to the performances, there are two other big elements that make ""Air Force One"" a great movie: the special effects and action scenes; and the presence of the plane itself. The action scenes are some of the best I've ever seen. And when we first see the plane from the inside, it looks as if were on a tour of the actual Air Force One itself and it's fascinating. Suspenseful, thrilling, and just downright exciting, ""Air Force One"" is a definite must-see.",/review/rw0402402/?ref_=tt_urv

","I cannot even understand myself, giving eight stars for this movie, 'Air Force One'. With Harrison Ford, it feels like Indiana Jones on the plane. Everything seems to work perfectly for hero's side with perfect timing. A president always makes morally right choices, and it sounds true that he tries to act God. A hero in this movie is such a flat character, screaming 'justice should be done' from the start to the end. On top of all, candlelight vigil scene really made me laugh. This movie stays on borderline of becoming so obvious and shabby. However, it works because of dynamic, intense, and entangled storyline. A main story happens on the plane, a president and his family trying to escape from the villain AND the crash. Political matter of releasing a dictator and a vice president handling the whole situation in White House strengthen the connection among all three different settings. With the help of music, 'Air Force One' succeeds in keeping on the edge of the seat, nervously waiting for next to happen.",/review/rw0402402/?ref_=tt_urv
