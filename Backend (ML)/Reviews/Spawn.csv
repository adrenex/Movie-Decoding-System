2 August 2019,pawanpunjabithewriter,8," Watch for the terrific end.
","I saw mixed reviews on this one. However, it was a highly rated comedy movie. So I had an urge to watch it.
I was disappointed with how the movie was taking pace. The first 45 minutes of the movie, didn't have much to do. It was too boring.
But right after then, the adventure awaited you! It takes turn, it takes pace, it gets funny, it gets terrific.
James Franco was brilliant. The most amazing thing was he was in the same pajamas whole movie.
It's boring initially but it's a ride of fun, adventure, drugs and crime towards the later end.",/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2008,littlemartinarocena,8," James Franco Is The Real Thing
","I laughed more in this movie than in any other of its ilk. Mostly thanks to James Franco. Yes, the James Dean Franco. His comedic timing is startling and his sympathy is all consuming. I think the secret is that we can (Franco allows us) see the human being behind this irresistible caricature. I was totally taken by the strange kind of innocence he exudes. We sense a loyal buddy who is capable of extraordinary generosity. His smile is already an iconic movie landmark. Seth Rogen is also very funny but you can guess that this is actually his character. Nothing wrong with that but James Franco's range is infinite. David Gordon Green makes his ""commercial debut"" very successfully. The showdown at the end takes a bit too long but all in all this movie is throughly worth it.",/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2019,PCT1970,7," Item 9, ILLEGAL!
","David Gordon Green has proven his ability to direct an array of films in different genres such as drama, horror and comedy. The latter applies here. Green helms an exceptional comedy. It certainly helps to have Rogen and Goldberg pen the screenplay. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, special effects, soundtrack and acting. I don't recall hearing Eddy Grant's, ""Electric Avenue"" being played on the radio as much as it did in the early 80's after this film was released. This film has a plethora of comedic artists as cast members who all deliver splendid performances. In particular Rogen, Franco, Robinson, Heard, Cole, Hader, McBride and Corrigan stand out. As a matter of fact the entire cast is spot on in their timing, delivery and portrayals. The plot revolves around a stoner process servicer, Dale and his weed dealing stoner best friend, Saul. Dale has to serve papers to Saul's dealer and witnesses the dealer murder his competitor. Dale leaves behind evidence that the dealer immediately recognizes as Pineapple Express. This ignites Dale and Saul running for their lives while being pursued by assassins and corrupt police. The plot is hysterical, violent, riotous, action packed, boisterous, vivacious and has a rib-tickling ending. There are many hilarious scenes in this film. Some of the scenes are when underground military secret testing on marijuana with Private Miller takes place; when Saul explains the evolution of Pineapple Express and the engineering of the cross-joint; the fight at Red's apartment; Saul's chase with the police in hot pursuit; the bombastic fully loaded explosive showdown and the breakfast at the diner. There are also many side-splitting quotes in the film. To this day you'll hear fans of the film quote Dale saying, ""You've been served"" or General Bratt screaming, ""We have a final decision on Item 9. ILLEGAL!"". The film is like an embodiment of the peaceful counterculture meets the violent underworld. This is a loveable, memorable and sublime comedy that is a treat to view stoned or not.",/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2008,ametaphysicalshark,," Vibrant, hilarious mesh of genres, and a different sort of film for David Gordon Green
","There will be many who will dismiss ""Pineapple Express"" as immature, overly silly, disjointed, and scatter-shot. There will be others who recognize it as a bizarrely artful, playful, loose genre-bending comedy with some outstanding performances, an inspired comedy script, and some great work from director David Gordon Green, certainly one of the finest young directors around.",/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2018,serafinogm,9," An absurdist movie that is absurdly funny!
","You can't view this movie from a critical perspective, dissecting it for realism and walking away disappointed because it fell short in some way, it's nothing more than a adult cartoon. This movie is just pure unadulterated entertainment where characters are injured in ways that would have terminated their existence yet somehow, like Wile E Coyote, they survive (Danny McBride's character sustains multiple potentially fatal injuries)! A movie made to entertain and that is just good clean fun and which happily (from my perspective) showcases Amber Heard. Seth Rogan involves himself in movies that I want to watch simply because of his involvement and if James Franco, Craig Robinson, and Danny McBride are in it then all the 
better. You need or want some light hearted fun sprinkled with barrel laughs then this is your vehicle!",/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2019,tesswysko,9," Weed Infused Bro-mance!
","It's been awhile since I watched this movie so I figured it was time to revisit it! It doesn't matter how old you are, weed jokes are always funny! And this cast just seems to get along so well together that it seems so plausible and they have so much fun working together you can tell that you just get immersed and can't help but laugh and it can make any bad day better! James Franco, Seth Rogen, and so many more big stars are in this movie and some of them only for a moment or two, and it all just meshes so well that even now that I know that they improvised quite a few lines it even goes to show that the script was written so well that it allowed for the creative nature of the actors to shine through and make it even that much more believable! And enjoyable!",/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2020,paulwattriley,7," Decent comedy which is awesome when high.
",I've seen this a few times and it is enjoyable and stupid. Its clearly aimed at stoners and I was high when I first seen it and just one one of those movies that is hilarious when stoned.,/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2008,Turfseer,1," I'd rather watch Beavis & Butthead!
","Seth Rogen is the type of actor who simply plays himself. In ""Knocked Up"", there was a positive arc to the story where he plays a loser who must take on adult responsibilities and eventually grow up. In ""Pineapple Express"", he remains a loser and we can never believe in his journey since he's pitted against a bunch of unlikeable, unsavory comic book characters. ",/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2008,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,10," Definitely my favorite Apatow-brand product, and one of the funniest of the year. A comedy with real heart
","It's been a year since the glorious Superbad hit theaters, and here we go again: Pineapple Express is the best comedy of the year, at least in this man's opinion. I haven't laughed this hard in a very long time, nor have I enjoyed myself more while doing so. It's got everything! Fire, weed, guns, car chases, explosions, a beautiful lady, Ed Begley Jr., and of course, blood and guts. Yes, I'm reviewing Pineapple Express, and not some twisted horror movie.",/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2020,masonsaul,8," Great action comedy
","Pineapple Express is a great action comedy that balances the action and comedy effectively. Seth Rogen, James Franco and Danny McBride are all great and have amazing chemistry. Craig Robinson and Ken Jeong are really good. David Gordon Green's direction is really good and it's well filmed. It's really funny throughout and well paced. However, it is brought down by its boring villiains.",/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2021,Johnny_West,8," Really Funny Buddy Movie
","If you can get past the constant marijuana presence in every scene, this movie is a really funny and sweet movie. Two guys who hardly know each other become best friends and save each other's lives thanks to their love for marijuana. It is a warm comedy about friendship and it is very funny. Every way it can take a funny turn, it does.",/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2018,sme_no_densetsu,8," An above average stoner/crime comedy
","""Pineapple Express"" is one of those comedies where a regular guy gets swept up into a situation he can't handle simply by being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Here, the regular guy is Dale Denton (Seth Rogen), a lowly process server who witnesses a murder. Soon, he finds himself on the run with his weed dealer (James Franco), who is also connected to the murder by association. Fleeing hitmen & corrupt police officers, the pair naturally proceed to get into various comedic situations throughout the course of the movie.",/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2021,RobTheWatcher,7," All time comedy
",This movie is actually a well written movie that is original and uniquely funny. It's one of those movies you can watch throughout time and it won't get old.,/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2009,kosmasp,8," Cheech & Chong reloaded
","I watched the movie at Sneak Preview, so I haven't seen the unrated DVD/Blu Ray cut yet. Still even that version, was pretty grim and a movie that will not appeal to people that get grossed out easily. I haven't seen ""Cheech & Chong"" in a while, but I do feel it has the same feeling.",/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2008,somf,10," Pineapple smokes all other stoner films
","Ever since Cheech and Chong appeared in ""Up In Smoke"" the stoner film has become a staple of American Cinema. I have enjoyed them since day one. Last night, I was privileged to see an advance screening of Apatow's funniest film to date by far, and I really enjoyed all his other films. The audience and I were laughing so hard that I need to see it again to pick up on the jokes that I missed. It has been a long time since I have seen a stoner film stoned, but I may have to make an exception the second time around.",/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv

10 September 2008,Otoboke,," Pineapple Express is good for many things, but the thing that it does best is in making you laugh.
","There's no doubt about it, Pineapple Express is a relentlessly funny stoner movie, start to finish with little in the way of compromise; telling the story of two stoners, who end up entangled within a drug conspiracy plot that threatens their lives while smoking plenty of pot along the way, this year's latest instalment to the genre is the finest example of dumb -but well delivered- comedy yet. One discrepancy against it's classification as a stoner comedy however lies in that even if you're not high yourself; even if you've never even been high in your life, there's still lots of fun to be had here as the jokes are broad enough in their design to apply to any ridiculous situation. So while the plant obviously makes a starring role here, the focus is not primarily on it, and the movie is better off as a result.",/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2008,pauljraab,4," Derails in the second half
","This started out as funny & clever and completely fell apart in the second half of the movie. For the first half, I'd give it close to an 8 and for the second a zero, so we'll average out at a solid 4. The second half ceased to be funny or clever and turned into one long, idiotic cliché. Honestly, it really felt like we lost our original set of writers & directors after an hour and they had to find a replacement set from some cheesy action movie. It totally came off the tracks when our light-hearted stoners picked up machine guns along with the rest of the thugs. Did the writers quit smoking weed and start doing meth or something? How could this have started so good and ended up such crap? I don't think I could be more disappointed after all the hype this movie has received.",/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2008,Quinoa1984,10," truly, insanely and shamelessly entertaining pot-movie spoof on action movies
","It's a given that when you go to a Judd Apatow movie now (and he's only directed two, but they're still 'movies' anyway, despite the growing stable of directors) you'll know what to expect more or less. After 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad, Walk Hard, and to a lesser extent Forgetting Sarah Marshall, there's an expectation- if you're tuned into the sensibility of off-the-wall, filthy but improvisational comedy- for it to be good, or even awesome in whatever 'fold' of comedy its in. Pineapple Express, for the Apatow fan, is as awesome and dumb and illogical and purely enjoyable as comedies get this year, let alone for its 'fold', which in this case is the pot comedy cross-pollinated with ridiculous 80s action flick.",/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2020,aidanratesmovies,10," Outragoeus, timeless, and by all means fun
","Endlessly entertaining, hilarious, and quite fun- Pineapple Express makes the best out of its outrageous script, ridiculous characters, and wonderful cast to provide for one of the greatest comedies of the year- if not the decade. The film does have its fair share of flaws, with a beginning that seems to only serve as a starting point rather than proving to be of any true value, and a few generic characters throughout. That being said, though the film's script is at times flawed and even thin, it is a massively fun time that nails every joke, punch, and moment of dialogue it has to say. Seth Rogen and James Franco make for a great duo, and though they did star in a couple more films together after this one, I would love to see the two of them and their great chemistry again on screen sometime soon. Danny McBride also gives a great performance as always, as well as a fine performance from Amber Heard, but unfortunately her character goes pretty much nowhere. The music in the film is a surprisingly fun touch, and the direction in the film is what truly feels like it is tied together. Without David Gordon Green, I feel like the film would be a lot messier than it is today, and thank god for having him on board, and making the film such a blast to watch.

1 February 2020,drpainters,9," One of my fave stoner movies
","Between this n Harold n Kumar. I watch each once a year, both are hilarious. This has more of a story/plot to follow do I would likely give this the edge.",/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2021,deepfrieddodo,7," Franco Fantastic
","A good stoner comedy, as stupid as you might expect, but not really Rogen's funniest work. The standout is Franco, who plays the lovable idiot perfectly, his stupid innocence providing the best moments of the film. The rest of the characters are okay, Rogen plays his regular character, with all the same actors from that usual scene. Some parts are really funny, like the car chase, but at other points interest can drop. It's a good stoner action comedy, not much more.",/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2017,dierregi,7," The monkey's out of the bottle
","Rogen and Franco are Dale and Saul, a couple of weed-smoking slackers who get involved in a murder. This type of movie is usually targeted to a young audience and tends to be filled with gross profane jokes, bad language and stupidity. Here we have plenty of bad language and stupidity, but the jokes are actually quite funny. ",/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2019,UniqueParticle,10," My 420th review and such a perfect choice!
","I saw this movie originally in theaters twice, actually crazy to think its been 11 years since even then I was super duper excited to see this ""Dopest dope"" it's like ""Gods Vagina"". I absolutely love this feel good movie probably seen it well over 20 something times, just haven't reviewed till now. So much of it is funny, entertaining and very memorable! I love every cast member especially Seth Rogen, James Franco, Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson are my favorites; perfect comedy to me.",/review/rw5073497/?ref_=tt_urv
