23 September 2021,exlana,9," Pretty decent
","Some of the jokes are hit or miss, but when it hit, it really witty and hilarious. The pop culture commentary is somewhat smart without being too pretentious. And it's also weirdly good family drama series.",/review/rw5020877/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2021,lauradaveyemail,9," Laugh out loud funny
","This is the first show I've watched in a long time where I actually fully laughed aloud. The lines are casually delivered with expert timing and it's an intelligent kind of dark, quick witted humour that probably best lands with ""elder millennials"" but is obviously funny for all. It's also one of those shows you can rewatch and find funny lines missed the first time around. Such good writing and acting! Ken Marino as the manager/ ""best friend"" of Chase Dreams is my favourite character. I'm so glad to see a season 2 is in the works. This is one of the most slept on shows. I've told all my friends to watch.",/review/rw5020877/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2019,valinvancouver,8," A well-crafted skewering of today's pop culture landscape
","I've watched the entire first season and every episode has been loaded with ""sick burns"" at the expense of what passes for popular culture these days. ""The Other Two"" are the virtually washed up, late 20s siblings of the latest internet sensation, the Justine Bieber-ish Chase Dreams. Riding the fringes of their brothers success and celebrity, this show brilliantly illustrates the vacuity and cynical marketing of social media fame. The fact that it's all so recognizable makes me wonder why it hasn't been addressed head-on like this before.",/review/rw5020877/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2019,atlasmb,8," A Clever Satire
","Chase Dubek aka Chase Dreams (Case Walker) is a 13-year-old social media phenom in the early stages of stardom. Mother Pat (Molly Shannon) is complicit in his attempt to achieve success. Chase's older siblings are the other two---Brooke (Helene Yorke), a former child dance student who dabbles poorly in real estate, and Cary (Drew Tarver), a waiter who wants to act. Their love lives are a mess and they long to achieve any goals they once envisioned.",/review/rw5020877/?ref_=tt_urv

25 September 2021,hillaryrmarshall,10," Just Increased Rating
","I literally laugh out loud when I am doing this show. The dynamic between Brook and Kerry is comic gold. They get into so many hilarious situations both together and separate and their reactions and commentary is raw and funny. Season one was funny, but Season 2 is easily even better.",/review/rw5020877/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2019,cscott2331,10," Seriously funny
","This show is my new favorite!! It's so UN-PC and that makes it all the more better. Jokes are raunchy, scenes are amazing and the writing...the writing is just top notch funny. Not a family show, so it may now be fore everyone. Too bad, because it's f#*%ing HILARIOUS!!",/review/rw5020877/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2019,idearz-429-638175,10," LOVE IT
","So good. Likable, dysfunctional characters at their best. Molly Shannon does not disappoint. Not sure why the ratings aren't higher. Must be the MAGA folks. Oh, well. I love it.",/review/rw5020877/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2019,edicionccq,8," THE OTHER TWO: I wanna be a child star, is gonna be bad.

30 June 2019,iainmcleod_800,10," Unexpectedly funny
","Give it a try, its very funny and the two main characters are great comedy actors. Especially the sister who gets some great one liners",/review/rw5020877/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2021,JLPDX,8," Excellent TV Comedy
","I'd expect no less from Lorne Greene but regardless this is a deliciously wry send up of today's dystopian entertainment landscape. The cast shines with comedy greats Molly Shannon, Richard Kind and Wanda Sykes along with some well chosen and unexpected comedic cameos. Great fun!",/review/rw5020877/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2019,brian_spence_ni,10," OMFG
","I could barely handle how continuously outrageous the first series was. I blasted it in about 3 hours, because I just couldn't stop watching.",/review/rw5020877/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2019,cdesantis530,10," Finally! A funny comedy.
","I only heard about this show from a social media comment by Ken Marino. Otherwise, I would have missed it. It needs more publicity. This show has great writing, great talent and so many laugh out loud moments.",/review/rw5020877/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2019,tonifan-48464,9," heartfelt hilarious and suprising
",Okay i saw the trailer for this show and while i wasnt sure what to expect the show was fantastic its hilarious and heartfelt the show has great characters and so funny at the same time very very good it has a tremindous first episode and i can only hope for better,/review/rw5020877/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2019,dckgrysn666,8," 'But also, like, *chase dreams* literally...'
","I'm three episodes in and loving this show. Went in skeptical of (potentially too gimmicky) premise, but the writing is solid and the actors are fantastic. If you're a fan of Schitt's Creek like me, you'll probably like this, too. If strong pilot doesn't hook you, move on.",/review/rw5020877/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2019,MegaMaexn,5," Massively underwhelmed!
","Expected a fun and quirky story here, but the characters as well as the writing left me wondering what the fuss was all about. Wasn't able to connect with the show at all and most of the jokes not only fell flat, but completely drowned in shallow water. If some people like this show, good for them, I guess they can be easily pleased with jokes about phones dropping into the toilet. I for my part would rather watch Schitt's Creek, which is actually cleverly written and hilariously funny!",/review/rw5020877/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2019,13Funbags,1," Total garbage
",I don't know what this is supposed to be. I do know that it's not comedy. It's a shame that Ken Marino has to be involved with this mess.,/review/rw5020877/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2019,cherold,7," solid comedy, even though I didn't stay with it
","I really like the premise of this series, in which two struggling actors watch their kid brother effortlessly become an overnight superstar. And the series itself is amusing and at times quite clever.",/review/rw5020877/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2019,bigchris-05888,10," real in your face comedy the way it was meant to be
",This was a show I had my questions about but it's hilarious raw and very funny the way comedy was before everyone got offended by Everything but I laughed my ass off at this one of the best new comedies,/review/rw5020877/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2019,katieh-00757,9," Funny!
",Better than I expected. Hopefully the pilot is a good indicator for the rest of the season,/review/rw5020877/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2019,maximdereno,8," Spot on series
","The writing is consistently strong, but The Other Two's strongest card comes in its casting, enlisting the aid of the ever-great Ken Marino as a sleazy agent, and Drew Taylor (a gay man himself) gives a non-stereotypical portrayal of homosexuality.",/review/rw5020877/?ref_=tt_urv

14 November 2021,aaron-jakes,10," All About the Writing!
","I absolutely love this show! The humor is so dry and cutting, and the characters will grow on you especially Carey and Brooke. Yes there is a lot of goofiness to the show, but its so packed with wit and humor that allows you to appreciate (or ignore) those goofier moments.",/review/rw5020877/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2022,jessicadavis-25909,10," HILARIOUS ingenious parody of the entertainment industry!
","I wanted to dislike the show , it's Comedy Central fare after all , but it's actually become one of my all time favorites. Yes it's extremely crude and I could do without the incessant references to the bum. But I guess you could say this appeals to my juvenile side slightly , then on the other hand , it's actually quite genius the way it pokes fun at this narcissistic technocratic climate , where everyone's worth is determined by the media , especially social media. Molly Shannon never disappoints, but the character Brooke is clearly the standout here , she has so many laugh out loud lines it's insane . I hate that the episodes are only a half hour because I breeze through the rewatches way too quickly . Idk if another season is coming , but damn I HOPE SO !",/review/rw5020877/?ref_=tt_urv
