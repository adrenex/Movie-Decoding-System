","DS 9 is simply the best of the Star Trek series, and, I suspect, will eventually emerge from its black sheep status and be remembered as the most mature and compelling SF series of the 20th century.",/review/rw0316940/?ref_=tt_urv

","DS9 is one of my all-time favorite television shows. It edges out Star Trek's original series just barely as my favorite in the franchise. I am not going to state that it's the best Star Trek series, because it definitely will not appeal to everybody, but it is my favorite.",/review/rw0316940/?ref_=tt_urv

",Before Deep Space Nine aired back in 1993 I felt quite a bit of apprehension. How could they have a Star Trek series without a ship going off exploring? I wasn't going to watch it but being a fan Star Trek and Star Trek:The Next Generation I had to watch it.,/review/rw0316940/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've watched this series at least three times now and it just keeps getting better. The subtleties are incredible, and I keep catching ones I missed the first two times I watched. So, seriously, watch this sober. Season five is great, but season six is unforgettable. But don't skip ahead, as nothing will make sense out of context.",/review/rw0316940/?ref_=tt_urv

","I remember reading in a plane that there was going to be a new Star Trek Series based on a space station to premiere in January 1993. I had always found the idea of Star Trek very appealing and enjoyed a few movies and original episodes now and then. At that time, I had never really got into The Next Generation which my family and friends seemed to love, but I figured I would at least give this new show a try. As I eventually sat there with my little brother and watched the two-hour pilot, little did I know that this would change my life for the next seven years, as I would have to plan my weekends so that I could catch every new episodes on Saturday nights like football fans' semi-sacred Sunday afternoons.",/review/rw0316940/?ref_=tt_urv

",I will preface this with I love all Star Treks even the newer crappier ones. But this one...wow. I have taken it upon myself to re-watch EVERYTHING starting with the OG Star Trek. I don't remember loving Deep Space Nine as much as I did after this run through.,/review/rw0316940/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2019,schlagzeugplayer,10," Wow the purists hate well Ive learned
","Why is the fact that this show revolves ( no pun intended) on a space station so unsettling to the heavy Trekkies. How many times in all the various incarnations of ST did they go, explore, dock, use a spacestation. So why can't we see one at work w all the various federation and non fed species interacting. Conflicts of some being a mirror of current affairs , the Cardassians and the Bejorans w terrorists and insurgents. Odo head of security, a shapeshifter why couldn't weve had this species before?, Quark a Ferenghi a species of merchants scoundrels,pimps,just all around a seedie character.Dax a being in a sort of reincarnation species that remembers it previous life, who is a counselor, easy on the eyes as they say. Love O'Brian from the SNG, in some ways a throw back to old Scotty. Then they have a doctor, Doctor Bashir like usual.Then there is Captain Benjamin Sisko, he is one of my favorite ST captains. He is strong, a father,his diction is exemplery just as Captain Picard. He has a very compelling way about him. I really want the Trekkies to give this guy his due. I haven't seen the new series in 2018 but Im hoping somehow Sisko reprises his role if possible. Okay now to address the obvious elephant in the room.
DS9 esp later in the series had similarities to another great series not in the ST universe but as a syfy lover in general it was much loved.. B5 or Babylon 5. You see in the real world the writers knew each other and there was some cross communication so it was inevitable.Both stations had a worm hole like plot, entertained sometimes rivaling species and later threatened by all powerful mysterious entity . Goid syfy is good no matter the universe , remember Farscape? Oh and that darn Q is here too.
The writing in this series was superior and there were hints of humor, irony and sometimes the inadequatcy of being human. I highly recommend this series.",/review/rw0316940/?ref_=tt_urv

","After half a century of occupation, the planet Bajor is finally free of the Cardassians(all but Garak, who remains, seemingly an exile is he really just a tailor? Could he be a spy for them?). Well, more or less the latter will continue to pester them, since there's now a treaty, and they retain some territories. The Provisional Government is a barely cohesive whole and doesn't have much support. Kira(Visitor, speaks her mind even when it'll get her in trouble) is the liaison between them and the Federation, who remain to support the rebuilding effort. The discovery of a nearby wormhole, the only stable known, complicates matters. It will enable travel back and forth between ""our"", quadrant, Alpha, and Gamma, which, until now, was so far away it made little sense to even consider going there. The orbiting station of Deep Space Nine will be a trading post and dock, dealing also with the plentiful traffic, all of which represents a potential help, or threat to the safety of the war-torn lands. And a few seasons in, also once ""the voice"" of this has been found, tensions increase and what was a great show becomes an excellent one.",/review/rw0316940/?ref_=tt_urv

",Star Trek: Deep Space Nine is one of those shows that I really wished was still going on. But if it had to end it certainly had one original ending which I'm not about to reveal.

28 February 2022,marmar13,8," The good version of Discovery
","DS9 is more character-focused and has longer story arcs than any Star Trek series before it (and after it until Disco). Unlike Disco, which is sheer melodrama, DS9 manages to simultaneously be fun and challenge viewers with dark and thought-provoking content. It's a difficult balance to achieve, and the writing team deserves kudos.",/review/rw0316940/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2020,nuretdinkaymakci,10," Perhaps the best Star Trek Series Ever
","I am a big ST fan, just before seeing DS9, I saw Voyager and then Next Generation (yes in reverse order), during COVID-19 lockdown. I liked them all, but I was very reluctant to see DS9 since it is fixed in a place, and I am not a fan of movies with conspiracy or intrigue. In the beginning, it looked like such a movie wit a shapeshifter and a disgusting Ferengi. The only familiar face was Chief O'Brien. As I watched, it became my number one show. The characters are very real, and their everyday life is relatable, and most of all, it bears all the ideals and principles of ST.
It is very hard to discriminate between the 1990's ST series, but DS9 is the best one I think. Since it is old, it may not attract you at the beginning episodes, just give a chance for a few episodes, then you will become addicted to it. Thanks to its producers, cast & crew for providing us such a brilliant show.",/review/rw0316940/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2012,gabe-129,10," Best show ever
",I will say it started off kinda strange. most star trek series is spent having adventures on a star ship. This series for the most part stays on Deep space nine. Although there is still plenty of adventure. The thing that really makes this show so good is its large cast. It has many reoccurring secondary characters that help the the space station seem like a fascinating place for the show to take place. This story is much darker and more thought provoking than the other series. This series has so many things going for it.,/review/rw0316940/?ref_=tt_urv

","As a writer I appreciate this Star Trek series more than all the others, the sheer intricacies of the various weaves of character's lives is beyond the imagination and follows the Vulcan Idic like no series ever did before nor after.
One constant of life is death,and deep space nine never tries to take you to far away from that simple reality,it doesn't hide in the points of view made, it's the braver series by far in terms of writing, mainly because it shatters the perfect veneer ,that most fans have, Star Trek does speak as a whole for a better future for humanity, but the galaxy is a huge place, with cultures beyond the count, and one day hopefully we will make contact, but in the meantime ds9 reminds us that while earth has become a paradise, maybe other places in the universe are struggling to reach theirs , life is not all sunshine and roses at least not yet, but this series offers more insight into the various races of Star Trek like no other series ever did, the depths they went to is in part a clue to the sheer brilliance of its writing, the interpersonal relationships that develop along the way seem almost a natural happenstance of real people put together in a real place ,such is the quality, sadly never to be repeated in my life time, the talents of the actors that portray this side of the trek universe do so with such passion ,it sells you , so if your ready to take the trip do so, but do it with eyes open ,there are more prospectives to learn from than just the great bird of the galaxy's , overall personally I believe that as a writer Gene Roddenberry would be proud that his creation both inspired others to write and to make other people think as an end result, Star Trek has taken on a life of its own , but of deep space nine I would simply say chun dol go daná , (to boldly go) and added it's own colour to the ever.growing tapestry started 50 years ago.",/review/rw0316940/?ref_=tt_urv

","Disappointed by all those new shows and movies ""re-imagining"" the Star Trek-universe I put Deep Space Nine on my plate again: and what a relieve it is! Every time I watch one of those ""old"" Star Trek shows and movies I realize once again how bad (besides the work of the special effects department) the new ones are. DNS got everything I liked and still like about the good old ST-universe: interesting and charming character- and world-building, fine stories with sub- and ""ueber""-plots. This is how Star Trek should be, everything else is nothing but bad ideas and bad composed scripts disguised by an overkill of special effects and action.

27 December 2020,jamesjustice-92,10," Voyage of a lifetime
","10 years ago I embarked on the journey. It was called Star Trek (the original series). Then there came The Next Generation, after that Enterprise, then Voyager and finally, more than 3 years ago I touched upon Deep Space Nine and have been on that cruise until tonight's final ST episode ""What you leave behind"". It's not easy to say goodbye to the show you grew to love so much, that was a part of your day-to-day agenda, a part of you but I won't ever say farewell to any of those shows. Deep Space is a lot different from the rest, with more emphasis on interpersonal relations, religion and politics than on plain adventures the other shows heavily relied on; being the only show from the family based on an immovable station rather than on a spaseship has got its disadvantages but a lot more perks too. It may not be my favorite Star Trek series but it sure has its own charm, fantastic characters and atmosphere I would never forget. I think today's so called ""Star Trek"" shows as well as the people themselves have got A LOT to learn from Deep Space Nine and the rest. Gene Roddenberry had created something much bigger than he could ever have imagined and boldly went where no one has gone before and still does with every new fan of Star Trek being born every minute. Immortal shows like these will never die and its topics and themes will always be relevant no matter what color, faith, race, gender or species you are.",/review/rw0316940/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was rewatching this series in 2019, and I was pretty supprised that it was filmed in 1993. This was way better than other movies/series that time. I am at bit upset that discovery did not continue / contibute the original start trek feeling (apart from very first series , which I personaly don't like). TNG,DS9,Voyager are just perfect series. The models are nice, the casting are ok (--Obrian ++Kira). The plot is All in One, nice anthology but in the background deep and well connected story line... Ok there is no CGI, but what you expect from1993 age of Amiga (babylone 5 cgi was worse if it would be not there). So I guess this series is one of the well made old timers with real masks and models.",/review/rw0316940/?ref_=tt_urv

","Before DeepSpace 9 I could say that I was not much of an ST fan. But I rented our the first movie ""Emmisary"" once just to take a look at what some had been saying bout it. From here on I was hooked, this was the most rich and diverse universe I've seen in a long time. None of these one shot location scenes being whole planets. None of these random encounters every episode with a brand new planet and new race and having no consequence on other episodes to follow. No, DS9 was far more detailed, you have politics, religion , love, drama ... everything. It makes the show seem so real. Then coupled with some of the most uniqu , interesting characters you just can't but help fall in love with this show.",/review/rw0316940/?ref_=tt_urv

","More than sci-fi this is a highly sophisticated, mature, almost philosophical show. You will question and meditate about almost every aspect of life after watching the episodes. Unlike the previous Trek show, you won't find many silly storylines or characters - in here even the most outrageous of them have some meaningful purpose. Despite the arc behind the entirety of the show, it is also very character driven. Storylines grow as the events unfold, nothing is settled in stone.",/review/rw0316940/?ref_=tt_urv
