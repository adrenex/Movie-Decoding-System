","Biggest problem with most action movies is that they take themselves way too serious. ""True Lies"" is mainly fun and entertaining and on top of that, the action is top class!",/review/rw2724209/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2007,claudio_carvalho,10," She Married Rambo and She Didn't Know
","The secret agent Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has been happily married with his wife, the legal secretary Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis), for many years living in the suburbs and having a teenager daughter, Dana (Eliza Dushku). Helen does not suspect that Harry has a double life, and she believes he is a computer salesman. After a top-secret mission, Harry finds evidences that Helen is having an affair with Simon (Bill Paxton), an used cars salesman that seduced Helen with the glamour and excitement of his fake life, telling her that he is a spy. Harry forces his partner Albert Gibson (Tom Arnold) to use the resources of their agency to follow Simon and Helen; they abduct Helen wearing masks and later they assign a pseudo mission for her. However, a group of terrorists kidnap Helen and Harry and the couple gets involved with a dangerous group that possesses an atomic bomb ready to be exploded in Florida.",/review/rw2724209/?ref_=tt_urv

10 September 2005,callanvass,10," Unquestionably One Of The Best Action Films Ever Made, With Phoenomenal Action Scenes And 2 Amazing Performances From Arnold Schwarzenegger And Jamie Lee Curtis
","This is unquestionably one of the best action films ever made, with phenomenal action scenes and 2 amazing performances from Arnie and Jamie Lee Curtis!. All the characters are wonderful, and the story is extremely gripping, plus Arnie and Jamie Lee Curtis are simply amazing in this!.The finale is simply incredible and is one of the most exciting ever, and i thought Arnie and Jamie Lee had amazing chemistry together, plus The ending was downright hilarious!. The chase scene with Arnie riding the horse, and Art Malik (the villain) riding the motorcycle, and i must say the famous dancing scene with Jamie Lee Curtis is fantastic, Jamie Lee is incredibly sexy, plus the supporting cast was great, and even Tom Arnold made me chuckle, and i always find him annoying!. The film is extremely exciting throughout, and some of the stunts were absolutely incredible, plus Arnie had some fantastic one liners as usual! ("" Your Fired""!). 2 of my favorite scenes, include The fantastic Bridge sequence where Arnie drags Jamie Lee Curtis in an helicopter with 1 hand, and another one of my favorites includes Jamie, dropping the gun, and it starts firing while falling down the stairs that was great!.",/review/rw2724209/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2001,scaevola,8," What a hoot! This might be Arnie's best, even though Jamie Lee almost steals the show.
","I had forgotten how funny this film is.  From the very start it begins to laugh at itself and the entire genre, with great audacity.  Every single scene is worth watching and I am still giggling about many of them.  (Well, ok, the camera angle on the scene with terrorist-as-missile is a teensy bit overdone.)

1 March 2005,ryan_kuhn,7," ""Can you hurry up. My horse is getting tired.""
","James Cameron has directed some fantastic action movies during his career (Aliens, the first two Terminator movies, The Abyss, Titanic--that boat action was like totally awesome!!), but none were as funny as True Lies is. Arnold Schwarzenegger (Terminator, Eraser, the Governor of California) is Harry Tasker, a computer programming father by day, James Bond by night, working for a top secret government agency that is beyond the CIA and run by Charlton Heston. Tom Arnold, in his first dramatic role, plays Harry's partner, Gib, and is the smartass, class clown of the agency. Schwarzenegger and Arnold have a fantastic chemistry, creating the movie's biggest laughs. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Harry's under-appreciated wife, Helen, who flirts with the idea of leaving Harry for a used-car salesman, played with uber-confidence by Bill Paxson. Helen finds out the true identity of her husband in another funny scene where both are captured by Arab terrorists with help from a truth serum. The action part of True Lies comes from Harry trying to track down the nuclear bomb that has been stolen by the terrorists. A wonderfully shot escape scene on the bridge that connects the Florida Keys to the mainland is the pinnacle of True Lies. An action film that does not take itself too seriously (notice all of the silly Arnold-lines peppered throughout the movie, my personal favorite being ""you're fired!"" before Trump thought of it), True Lies is wildly entertaining, so much so that you almost forget Tom Arnold was married to Roseanne.",/review/rw2724209/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 1999,baumer,9," Arnold, James and Bill. How can you go wrong?
","When a film has extravagant special effects, robust action, dazzling direction, wicked comedy and a cast of great actors like Schwarzenegger and Curtis and Arnold and Paxton, how can you go wrong?  You can't.",/review/rw2724209/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2003,michaelRokeefe,7," I didn't say 'cause you didn't ask.
","James Cameron directs this terrific action flick that gives way to bursts of comedy. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a spy trying to keep his profession a secret from his wife(Jamie Lee Curtis)and realizes that she is having an affair. The mild mannered salesman is really a double fisted devil may care secret agent. The beginning and final sequences are a movie in themselves. My favorite scenes are Curtis' striptease in the hotel and her ""cat fight"" with the gorgeous Tia Carrere in the limo. Plenty of gun fights and big bangs to please everyone. The cast also features Bill Paxton, Art Malik and Tom Arnold in his funniest and greatest role as Schwarzenegger's sidekick. There is a small role for Charlton Heston as the stern single minded boss. Absolute entertainment.",/review/rw2724209/?ref_=tt_urv

","Boy, I haven't seen this in quite a while but I did watch it several times in the mid '90s and usually was thoroughly entertained. It's pretty long at 141 minutes but I don't remember anyone ever complaining they were bored watching this. The combination of spectacular action scenes and humor made this a big hit.",/review/rw2724209/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2000,Rammstein-2,8," Great fun - don't expect anything else
","Why should one watch this film? It's stupid, without any character developments and is about as believable as any James Bond movie. I'll tell you: It's great fun. When I watch a movie, I try not to confuse art with entertainment, as some commenters clearly have done. True Lies doesn't have a hint of art - but its comic-style spirit and adventurous action is compelling. And please don't be childish - admit you like seeing nukes go off on screen. This film isn't a Great Film. But it is Great Fun.",/review/rw2724209/?ref_=tt_urv

","Joining Terminator 2: Judgement Day as one of the best action movies of all time! Terminator 2 is my favourite action movie of all time followed by Aliens, but this has to be extremely close! This is not only one of the best Cameron movies, but also one of the most fun movies I have seen in my entire life. The action is absolutely breathtaking! The script is absolutely hilarious! It's got all of your favourite Arnold Schwarzenegger dialogue that James Cameron seems to be extremely good at. The one-liners are perfect, the performance by Jamie Lee Curtis is great and she makes it even better.",/review/rw2724209/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2000,eibon09,," Splendid Collaboration between Scwarzenegger and Cameron
",True Lies(1994) was one of the best and most exciting motion pictures of 1994.  It blends action sequences with some spy intrique.  The film is Schwarzengger's most complete action film and his best role of his career. Jamie Lee Curtis and Tia Carrere do a terrific job as the heroine and femme fatal respectively.  True Lies(1994) is an action flick with a sense of humor.,/review/rw2724209/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2012,Tweekums,9," Arnie doing what he does best
",Helen Tasker believes that her husband sells electronics for a living he doesn't; he is an agent working for a secret US counter insurgency agency. His most recent mission has provided data suggesting that a terrorist organisation is planning to smuggle four stolen nuclear warheads into the United States. It appears that beautiful art importer Juno Skinner may be involved in the smuggling and when Harry goes to see her he is spotted by the terrorist leader Salim Abu Aziz; a chase ensues as Aziz tries to have Harry killed. This leads to Harry getting home late; to make up for it he decides to take Helen out for lunch but as he enters her office he overhears her on the phone; it appears that she is having an affair. Distracted from his work Harry sets about discovering the mystery man with the help of his partner Harold. As they listen in it appears that the man she is seeing is also an agent of some sort; or so he claims Harry must take drastic measures if he is to save his marriage. He might have been distracted but the terrorists haven't and they grab him and his wife; just as it looked as if he'd saved their marriage their lives are in danger as they must both fight to stop Aziz.,/review/rw2724209/?ref_=tt_urv

","True Lies (1994) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Hulu. The storyline follows a secret agent whose marriage is on the rocks. He is gone from home often and isn't giving his family the attention they desire leading to his daughter developing bad habits and other ""agents"" getting his wives attention. The agent is in the middle of a significant mission, but his only way to win back his wife may be to get her involved in his adventures.",/review/rw2724209/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2009,rmax304823,5," Funny, Deliberately for a Change.
","Director James Cameron gets this action thriller off to a good start with a twenty-minute sequence of Arnold as a Mega-CIA agent insinuating himself into a party, blowing part of the place up, and shooting his way out, killing everybody who gets in his way. He is attacked by two Dobermans but boxes both their ears at the same time and disables them. (A brief shot shows us that they were unharmed. Never mind all the dead humans; dead dogs are depressing.) The sequence has no more to do with the plot than thirty seconds of ham-handed exposition would tell us.",/review/rw2724209/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2000,anthonyx,," best arnie movie!
","I've seen this movie countless amount of times as with all the other arnie movies, but this is my favourite for sure.  Whilst it doesnt rate as high in action compared to the other Arnie movies.   This is definately arnies best comedy and with the above average action, it makes this movie Arnies best overall movie.  Heaps of good explosions, shooting and hand to hand combat and hilarious comedy from all cast members.  Art Malik and his men were hilarious especially when they were trying to be serious.  Tom Arnold is perfect for his role, hilarious without even trying.  But the funniest of all would have to be Bill Paxton especially while he is in the car with Arnie describing Jamie Lee Curtis to him and role playing a secret agent. Truely belly aching laughter!  Tia Carrera and Jamie Lee Curtis were absolutely gorgeous.  Who could ever forget that striptease by Jamie Lee Curtis? A 10/10 for me.  I havent felt so good after watching a movie for a long time.",/review/rw2724209/?ref_=tt_urv

","I SHOULD love TRUE LIES. I mean, I love the track records of almost all those involved, and this was a hugely successful movie packed with explosive action. It's a film that mixes in ample comedy with the thrills and most people seem to love it. Yet it's a film that leaves me somewhat cold, and no amount of sophisticated special effects shots can change that.",/review/rw2724209/?ref_=tt_urv

","When people think of James Cameron, all that comes to mind is the first 2 Terminator's, Aliens and the dumb, sappy Titanic. But one film that is often overlooked on his profile is 1994's ""True Lies"" which differs in tone from Cameron's other darker films such as the before-mentioned Aliens the Terminator films. ""True Lies"" gives us a tone that is lighter and more comedic, but still packing the hardcore energy that Cameron is known for.",/review/rw2724209/?ref_=tt_urv
