25 July 2016,A_Different_Drummer,5," Who ordered a 2016 film with 1960s values...?
","Writer/Director Chris McCoy was born in 1981 but, to all intents and purposes, he may as well have come from the 1960s, because, for all its pretense about edginess, the standards and values for this soggy teen coming-of-age story may as well have been plucked from a Doris Day/Rock Hudson romcom.",/review/rw4861352/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2019,egon_krentz,2," Unbelievably bad script
","The movie looks well made, the actors are decent enough but the storyline and dialogs are so bad that sometimes I wondered if the whole thing was a persiflage. Alas, it isn't.",/review/rw4861352/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2017,Brc123,4," Not exactly sure what I just watched
","This movie was kind of a mess from all standpoints. The plot was uninteresting and incoherent. Like, what was the conflict/initial incident even supposed to be? Oh no, their summer of partying has been kind of mediocre...this is so riveting. None of the party scenes were interesting either, ""Woah I made a souffl√©"", ""Wow I'm catching food in my mouth"" ""Oh my, watching someone skinny dipping from a kilo meter away, this sure is scandalous!"". And wtf was that dump party at the end? Running around with megaphones and doing mattress fights, no high schoolers do this. Not much was even accomplished in the end. One guy whored himself out and got a yeast infection and was fired from his job. The girl had an unsuccessful relationship where she was cheated on. The karate dude did a bunch of drugs and got fired from his job. And the last guy got a handjob. They only went to like three parties. Barely anything even happened and they're all celebrating at the end as if they just threw Project X. ",/review/rw4861352/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2017,SnoopyStyle,5," promising premise undelivered
","Nora (Zoey Deutch), Andy (Nicholas Braun), Lion (Mateo Arias), and Spice (Israel Broussard) are best friends since childhood. They are unflinchingly good kids in the poor side of the resort town and headed for good colleges. They refused to party or do anything bad. Lion teaches martial arts to little kids. One of his students invites him to her birthday party on the rich side of town where they've never been. The group of townie friends decide to go partying and do all the bad things that they missed.",/review/rw4861352/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2018,siderite,7," Flawed teen summer movie
","The movie was reasonably fun. The actors played well, the ideas were interesting, if not original, and besides a glaring lack of tension, it was an OK movie. It's the old idea of kids who decide to party before they each leave for college, but in this case there were ""the good kids"" which stayed home and virgin in order to study to get to the good colleges, so they have a ""summer of yes"" in which to do all the things they regretted not doing in high school. Yet they are all well off and ridiculously good looking and people like them so there are no real obstacles to overcome in reaching their goals. So yes, it's a feel good movie, but it's way too easy for them to feel good, so the viewer has little opportunity to empathize.",/review/rw4861352/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2017,said-buet10,4," You are not gonna remember watching this
",As soon as you are finished watching this you are gonna start to forget everything about it. This movie will have no impact on a viewer. The story is mundane. Most of the times the jokes were not funny. The acting were amateurish more than often. The direction is not at all commendable.,/review/rw4861352/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2022,ksf-2,6," a porky's for rich kids
","A group of kids who were never popular in high school decide to break out of their shells and go crazy over the summer before they head off to college. Of course, nic braun (plays andy) is 28, so its hard to picture him as a high school senior. Although he did get the role on succession soon after this. Andy claims to be a tennis teacher, but the rich, society women are actually paying him for sex. Good for him. But we seem to lose track of the other three for most of the film. Lion teaches martial arts, but seems to be trying every drug there is. Not sure what the journey or conflict is here... maybe just to stay out of jail until they head off to college. For high school kids, they don't seem to have any rules or parents. Just rich kids doing rich kid things. Hard to feel sympathy for them. The script needed a major tune-up. It's pretty much a starring role for braun.... the others seem to be along for the ride. Written and directed by chris mccoy.",/review/rw4861352/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2017,danew13,6," Enjoyable Coming of Age Story of 4 Nerds

24 July 2017,Reno-Rangan,6," The summer of YES!
","It was just like the British film 'Kids in Love' I'd seen prior to this. Explored only on a comedic side. Four friends who have been the ideal kids, after a few years later on one summer, before heading to the college, they have decided to accomplish everything they had missed in their life so far. So it's a time to blend in with what their kind do, but not as easy as it seems. Sometimes everything goes out of their proportion and some of them struggle at beginning itself. Overall, how their summer ends, in that, what they had gained and lost was told.",/review/rw4861352/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2017,sofiane1044,1," Good Kids = Bad movie

7 November 2016,jtungsten16,10," I Loved ""Good Kids""
","I really loved ""Good Kids"" the movie from start to finish was pure entertainment! I throughly enjoyed the actors and really felt a connection to them. This is Director Chris McCoys first film and I have to say, he did a great job! He executed the story beat after beat and another thing I enjoyed about Good Kids was the beautiful scenery of Boston. The only thing that I found wrong with the movie was, I think it needed some slap stick comedy. This movie lacked comedy, but was entertaining enough to keep me peeled to the screen, so that's a good thing. I really liked the music and Nicholas Braun is a class act of an actor! Love, Love, Love him!",/review/rw4861352/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2018,bmayfair74,7," Fun stress release
","I had a stressful day at the office, wanted to switch off and chuckle with no tension or drama. Good kids is the perfect movie for that. Don't expect too much, but if you just want to chuvkle and go along for a nice ride, enjoy",/review/rw4861352/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2017,tflwerchild,2," Waste of time
","Teen movies have always been a ""guilty pleasure"" that with time I've learned to ditch the guilty, and genuinely enjoy them full on. So, when I found this film, it seemed like a good watch. Original? Not really, but it didn't matter. Obviously, my expectations weren't set up high, but Jesus Christ, this movie failed to even reach a certain point of quality.

2 February 2017,olikersh,2," Worse than average
","This movie treads the same ground as countless other teen summer comedies only it does it considerably worse. The characters manage to be both 2 dimensional and thoroughly unlikable, each scenes drifts into another with no real sense of purpose or momentum and so much of it is worthy of being cut you would struggle to make this into a reasonable short film. There is an underlying sense of bitterness from the writer/director across this film and everything in it just seems lazy. Most of the actors are fine with the very little they are given but don't be surprised if you find yourself 20 minutes into this film feeling like its been more than an hour. If somebody spent money on this, they've wasted it.",/review/rw4861352/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2017,xxwhatsername,7," A bunch of 'Good Kids' decide to make up for lost time by trying to have fun during their summer break.
","This movie was fun to watch! I mostly watched it because of Zoey Deutch. All her movies are usually amazing and I was glad to see that this one is too. It's different from the usual teen movies and I think that's is really good. Despite the terrible Indian accent, I had a great time watching Good Kids.",/review/rw4861352/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2017,annushehrahim,1," Complete miss
","I can see what this movie was trying to do - a bright, fun and feel-good smart movie about a group of ""nerds"" graduating high school, who want to make up for all the experiences they missed in high school before they go to their respective ivy league colleges. Unfortunately, instead you got a 20% there movie that made me cringe more than it made me laugh. ",/review/rw4861352/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2023,destroyerwod,8," Pretty fun movie like they don't make them anymore.
","I am a sucker for these raunchy teen comedies. Sadly in today's society they don't make them anymore ever since we got ""woke"" and it has become somewhat unnacceptable to just have fun, vulgar and gross comedies. Nowaday everything has to be about society ""values"", diversity of all kinds and political correctness.",/review/rw4861352/?ref_=tt_urv
