26 August 2022,jtindahouse,3," A ""comedy"" with nothing to offer
","Something I've noticed with writer/director John Hamburg is that he either writes extremely funny comedies, or comedies that won't make you laugh once. 'Me Time' is unfortunately the latter. This movie was not funny in the least bit.",/review/rw8490470/?ref_=tt_urv

29 August 2022,Calicodreamin,4," Not funny
","I don't think I chuckled even once during this whole movie. Both the dialogue and the storyline were bland and none of the jokes landed. Acting was fairly decent from the cast but the characters lacked depth. Plot was kind of all over the place and a lot of unnecessary back and forth. The ending was way too forced feel good, it was expected and delivery lacked any real empathy. Was expecting a lot more from this cast but surprisingly Hart and Wahlberg lacked the buddy chemistry needed to pull something like this off. Definitely a skip, not worth the time it took to watch. Like they pulled all the modern movie tropes and tried to pass them off as unexpected.",/review/rw8490470/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2022,darill-28027,2," Wow is Netflix really trying to suck badly at making movies now?
","This wasn't a very good movie, I was expecting the best from Mark and Kevin, they didn't do well in this movie, it was almost like they were forced to do things they didn't want to do but who can blame them?! I mean why does Netflix feels they need to show support for Amber Heard? And why do they feel they need to include politics in the movie? This where Netflix really screws things up with their movies. Nobody is interesting in politics inside the movie, we watch movie to take a break from all that crazy politics to avoid them not to watch them. Many of us are very disappointed in Netflix. It is sad that I have to give such low ratings, especially for Kevin and Mark they are both known to be awesome actors, I don't blame them for anything, I truly feel they were forced to act this way because of Netflix or their horrible director, I feel like they are using the same director that makes bad movies on Netflix. Sad to say.",/review/rw8490470/?ref_=tt_urv

28 August 2022,craigmbritt,2," Disappointed
","I love Kevin Hart and Mark Wahlberg so when I saw this movie come out I was excited to see it. What a big disappointment. It was all around terrible. The writing was lazy, acting was bad, and the special effects were awful. The writers seemed to be more concerned about adding woke culture into this movie than funny jokes. You could see the jokes coming which was annoying. The acting was terrible and it felt like Kevin and Mark were forced to do this movie. They used a bit of special effects and green screens and you could really tell because it was all so bad. This movie made me cringe more than laugh. Movies like this is why Netflix is losing subscribers.",/review/rw8490470/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2022,nickijjohnson-16955,3," More like Waste of Time
",When I first saw this trailer I wished that it was not a Netflix movie and was in theaters because with a comedic duo like Kevin Hart and Mark Wahlberg it deserved an audience. So I thought. Truthfully nothing about the cast was the problem. The story was all over the place and it was painfully unfunny. It was just cheesy and I fail to see why every comedy feels like some random wild animal attack is supposed to be funny. The party scenes were weak like a watered down version of Bad moms and of all musicians they get seal who just added another boring scene to an already boring movie. I mean it's Mark Wahlberg and Kevin Hart so it's not a total disaster but the script was just crap. A silver lining for me was a newcomer that played the Uber driver Thelma. She's really got something. Bet money you're gonna see her more and hopefully in leading roles. That said the only other highlight was seeing Mark Wahlberg's ass. I really thought it was gonna be good it just wasn't but definitely not the actors' fault. They worked with what they had.,/review/rw8490470/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2022,elvylanda,5," Kevin Hart entering that very dangerous road of an Adam Sandler lazy movie career.
","Me Time is a comedy starring Kevin Hart and Mark Wahlberg as long time buddies who reunite after a few years of not seeing each other to have another adventure together celebrating Hart's character birthday. Wahlberg plays Huck while Hart plays Sonny. Sonny gets depressed knowing that he's a Mr. Mom, stay at home dad, while his wife, played by Regina Hall, is an up and coming architect. As a result, Sonny gets depressed that all he is a super dad who directs school talent shows. This is where Huck comes in, and Huck being the crazy, wild child, they automatically get into trouble and adventure that results in Sonny and Huck destroying things and saving one another from a loan shark.",/review/rw8490470/?ref_=tt_urv

4 September 2022,deloudelouvain,7," Typical Kevin Hart comedy.
","If you don't like Kevin Hart, I mean if you don't find him funny, just skip this one then. Because it's a typical Kevin Hart comedy character you get in Me Time, the one he mostly plays, and that's fine by me as I find it entertaining to watch. Mark Wahlberg already proved he can play in comedies and in this one he plays a good sidekick for Kevin Hart. I won't say it's the greatest comedy ever, far from that, but it has some good moments, good enough to cheer me up a little bit in this sad world. The comedy genre is just very difficult to rate as we all have a different sense of humor so before watching this one ask yourself if you ever liked a movie with Kevin Hart before? The answer to that question should be enough to whether you should watch Me Time or not.",/review/rw8490470/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2022,dmaluba,2," Did not laugh once
","It's a shame that this kind of dumb down dribble keeps getting made. You would think that Netflix could find something more imaginative and interesting than this regurgitated nonsense. Not sure who this film was meant for but if you enjoyed this nonsense seek help immediately. So cliche it gravitates toward the ridiculous. Let's encourage originally, more international projects. No wonder people are canceling their Netflix account! I wish they would give the viewing audience a little more credit. I don't find Kevin Hart and the other dude very funny. Never laughed once... Maybe their target audience were stoned teenagers.",/review/rw8490470/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2022,gianmarcoronconi,7," Nice
","If one leaves out the continuous holes in the plot, logic and truthfulness of the actions done, the film is very nice and entertaining, but above all it manages to fulfill its main task, which is to entertain the viewer in a light and not too thorough way so as to create a film with a very pleasant atmosphere that manages to be funny throughout its duration. Obviously the film has many defects especially for the real uselessness of the underlying plot but if one takes it as a series of comic skits connected by a common thread in the background then one can really enjoy this film in a beautiful and genuine way.",/review/rw8490470/?ref_=tt_urv

28 August 2022,ballslarge,1," They took scenes from other funny movies and ruined them
",There was nothing original in this movie and it was not funny. It's like a pieced together movie of unfunny clips that tried to rip off other good movies and failed. I have nothing else to say except why did I waste my life with this. I would not recommend watching a minute of this movie. It's bad from beginning to end and leaves you with the feeling of empty ness. I could have stared at the wall for two hours and it would have been more enjoyable. This should never have been made and should be immediately erased from human history. I doubt if you sat down and tried to write the worst movie in history it would be as bad as this was.,/review/rw8490470/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,6," It felt like a 101 minute long bland SNL sketch.
","Kevin Hart with Mark Wahlberg is not a bad idea for a comedy film, but the cliched by the numbers writing and directing by John Hamburg was the biggest joke here. It felt like a last minute SNL sketch were every writer threw in a theme just to get something out for the viewers, and every idea totaled the bloated runtime, then mixed in some Johnny Knoxville antics in attempt to make the story funnier. Although I did chuckle only a few times in the entire runtime, none of it was as funny as it was in poor taste. It took the 'fun' out of funny. Although the pacing was decent, the content was just too bland, cliched, predictable and all over the place. It's a generous 6/10 all going to the leads who did their best with the slop they were given.",/review/rw8490470/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2022,jcooloti,1," A Netflix abomination of stupidity.
","I want to slam this poor attempt at a comedy but when I try to think of something to say about it, I just draw a blank because the film is so incredibly terrible that I have repressed all memories of it. I understand that this is meant to be a comedy and not taken too seriously, but this script defies all logic. I am ashamed of myself for haven seen it. It's 100% unfunny TRASH. It goes on and on and on... strangely tries to come off as a family comedy at parts... it's a complete mess. All I can say is that things just happen in this movie and it's supposed to be funny but it's not. How can I even explain it? I can't. It defies all logic. Every character is awful, except for Kevin Hart who is just being Kevin Hart, but that alone can't save the movie even if he might make you chuckle every now and again. What a waste of money and resources this film is. The people that made this movie happen should really be ashamed of themselves. There's so many better things you can do with your money than make dumb stuff like this.",/review/rw8490470/?ref_=tt_urv

","Huge let down. I was so excited to see Mark and Kevin together but this movie is really bad. It is so forced, so predictable and soooo cheesy. I turned it off at the halfway mark. It was genuinely uncomfortable to watch. I'm actually in shock this movie was even made. Don't waste your time. This one can be skipped. And in as much as my review won't post unless it has 600 characters I guess I'll just ramble on until I reach the stupid amount needed to post this review. Post my review. Post my review.

26 August 2022,stellbread,2," This Film Has Adam Sandler Vibes; Not a Good Thing
","This film reminds me so much of one of Adam Sandler's mediocre films. The premise is Sonny Fisher (Hart), a househusband, gets time off to hang out with an old friend (Wahlberg) for a good time. From here the film becomes a predictable mess as Fisher's attempts at fun constantly get him into dangerous predicaments. We are subject to the usual Hart screeching and shouting his dialogue ad nauseum. Wahlberg's character is a lot like the controversial SNL spoof of him. Meanwhile we hardly see the wife (Hall) who is spending time with the kids whom she rarely sees due to her busy schedule as an architect. It's as if Hall is trying to steer clear of the residual shame of being in such an unfunny film; one so bad it's like the Hart and Wahlberg showed up for shooting without first reading the script.",/review/rw8490470/?ref_=tt_urv
