22 June 2014,VickiHopkins,7," British Crime, Not Zombies
","Let's clarify this title early on - it's not about Zombies. Waking the Dead is a BBC series that focuses on a cold case murder squad. They probably could have chosen a better title, because I passed over this show multiple times after seeing the word ""dead"" and thinking ""waking"" was ""walking."" (That was before I got my new glasses.)",/review/rw2130626/?ref_=tt_urv

29 March 2003,lje32677,," Wonderful show
","The programming in the US is poor to be polite.  So, we, as viewers look elsewhere.  One of my favorite places is the BBC.  Now on BBCAmerica there is an excellant show called ""Waking the Dead"".  It is intelligently written, tense and the actors are wonderful.  All of them.  I had known, just a little about Trevor Eve(Detective Superintendent Peter Boyd) before, but I had never seen anything of Sue Johnston, Holly Aird, Clair Goose, or Will Johnson's work.  It's a shame, because I can see they are all wonderful actors and actresses. Trevor Eve plays the head of the Cold Case Squad that investigates unsolved murders.  I don't know if it's by plan or not, but Eve presents the character of Boyd as an arrogant, egotistical, yet an  intelligent man with boyish charm.  Boyd is also haunted by the disappearance of his 16 year old son.  There was a fight and the son disappeared.  Boyd doesn't know if the boy is dead or alive.  This affects his job. Sue Johnston is Dr. Grace Foley, the profiler of the team.  I didn't know anything about her.  She presents Foley as a caring, intelligent woman. She is perceptive.  She and Boyd have been friends for a long time and understands his pathos.  When on a tyraid, Foley is the only one who will face Boyd down and make him back down. Holly Aird is Dr. Frankie Wharton.  She is the forensic specialist and is anal about crime scenes.  She even goes as far as requiring masks for the entire team when entering a crime scene.  She is intelligent and will also face down Boyd if necessary. Clair Goose is Detective Constable Mel Silver.  She is a fresh, eager detective who wants to be taken seriously.  She is fasctidious in collecting evidence and tries to cover all bases.  She also dislikes Boyd's patronizing attitudes as he often thinks, because of her young age that she can't do the job.  She usually gets around it by forcing her way through his perceptions and doing what she knows is right anyway. Wil Johnson plays Detective Sargeant Spencer Jordon.  He is an intelligent man who comes from the streets of London.  All he's ever wanted to do is be a policeman.  He is methodical and as he relaxes into his role, he is letting his imagination help him think about the crimes they come across.",/review/rw2130626/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2003,mightymezzo,," Message to BBC: PLEASE SEND MORE!!
","I've been watching the series on BBC America.  Turned it on part-way through an episode and haven't turned away yet.  It is exceptionally well-written and well-acted and positively disturbing.  Love it. I was especially impressed with the most recent episode, ""Into Thin Air."" Actually taped it and sent it to my sister the mystery buff, who doesn't have cable.  She passed it on to our parents (who don't have cable, either). Mom wants to see more.  If anyone from the BBC is reading this, PLEASE SEND MORE!",/review/rw2130626/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2002,jhsteel,," Intelligent drama
","This is a wonderful drama series and I hope there will be much more in the future. Being a fan of CSI (Crime Scene Investigation) but also being a scientist and frustrated with the unrealistic portrayal of scientific procedures in CSI, I'm more impressed by Waking the Dead. Frankie strikes me as a thorough person and very professional, she knows how long it takes to analyse a sample of DNA, and its limitations. All the characters in the Cold Case Unit are totally convincing and fascinating people in themselves, especially Trevor Eve's character Boyd.  This series continues to be very satisfying and has depths that are lacking in more superficial ""murder mysteries"".  If only all the cold cases in this country could be sorted out by this lot - it would make life easier for many suffering victims of crime.",/review/rw2130626/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2014,ianlouisiana,10," The daddy of TV forensic cop series
","Now 14 years old,""Waking the dead"" continues to reign supreme in what has become a very overcrowded field - the TV forensic/cop show. It has always had a terrific ensemble cast and despite losing actors of the quality of Miss Claire Goose and Miss Holly Aird around the halfway mark it has maintained its momentum in a way few long - running TV series have managed. It benefits greatly from a superb double- act from the leads,Miss Sue Johnston and Mr Trevor Eve as the forensic psychologist and the boss cop,ostensibly a chalk and cheese combination,but one in which each one complements the other although they often violently disagree. As Peter Boyd Mr Eve is passionate and eager to pursue justice sometimes careless of the rules of evidence and procedure in doing so. As Grace Foley,Miss Johnston is more analytical,takes a step back to see the bigger picture and reins Boyd in when he threatens to get out of control. We know nothing of Dr Foley's personal life,but Boyd's is,predictably, disastrous with a son who goes missing from home and,as the series develops,begins to play a big part in his father's professional life,causing him to have more sympathy with disaffected young people than he might otherwise have had. Over the seasons many fine and well - known performers have appeared to much advantage,but the core of the programme remains Boyd's squad of sometimes disparate but always intuitive and dedicated people. The only caveat I have is that sometimes the camera dwells with lipsmacking relish a little too long at the bodies of Boyd's clients,particularly in the later episodes.Apart from that,""Waking the dead"" is ,for me,a completely positive experience and still the one to beat for the many similar shows that have followed it.",/review/rw2130626/?ref_=tt_urv

","Trevor Eveheads the cast in this gritty yet popular BBC1 series as Detective Superindent Boyd, an arrogant but effective leader of the Cold Case Squad, which investigates old, unsolved murder cases. Using modern methods and new technology that may not have been available during the original investigation the team aim to uncover lost information. Helped by forensic profiler Dr Grace Foley, (Sue Johnston) Detective Sergeant Mel Silver, (Claire Goose) Detective Inspector Spence Jordan, (Will Johnston) and assisted by their able forensics scientist Dr Frankie Wharton (Holly Aird) the cold case squad dig into the past, resurface, reconstruct, and discover the secrets that time had buried.",/review/rw2130626/?ref_=tt_urv

30 November 2018,qui_j,5," Horrible editing coupled with pretentious philophizing
","Their series started off well but by the time the 4th rolled around, the editing and scripts seem to have taken a nosedive. While I understand the need for flashbacks, inserting them randomly just leads the viewer into chaos and confusion. The need for philosophical rants proves also very distracting and often deteriorated into shouting matches between the characters. In some of the episodes it's difficult to keep track of who the victims are due to the constant overuse of flashbacks and the different actors playing the same character.",/review/rw2130626/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2003,graham1956,," simply a good a show by the BBC

20 October 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," High quality detective series
","Waking the Dead along with Inspector Morse, New Tricks, Agatha Christie's Poirot and Touch of Frost is one of my favourite detective dramas. Why? It is superbly shot, with the dark photography and brooding scenery. True, there have been some truly disturbing and perhaps graphic moments throughout the series. But with the quality of how it is made, acted and written, that is so easily forgiven. The scripting is intelligent and sensitive, and the episode ideas are outstanding. The acting is absolutely fabulous, with Trevor Eve absolutely phenomenal as Boyd, and Holly Aird and Sue Johnston providing terrific support. There is nothing funny really in Waking the Dead, but while it is a little bleak once or twice, others were very moving. One scene worth of mention was Boyd standing over his dead son in the morgue, I was weeping buckets in that particular scene, it was just as moving as the finale of Inspector Morse and anyone familiar with that will know how heart-rending that was. And the tight direction ensures plenty of tense moments, and I can't count the number of times I've got goosebumps from watching this. All in all, a superb series, look out for it. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2130626/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2009,winstonfg,9," Great series, but I'm glad I don't work for Boyd
","Yet more proof, if any was needed, that the Brits do police procedurals better than the Yanks. Three-dimensional characters, claustrophobic sets and great ensemble acting seem like a pretty good place to start; and not talking down to your audience helps too.",/review/rw2130626/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2009,pmshah1946,8," Character development not quite right
","I came across some DVDs of earlier seasons. After watching a few episodes It got me thinking about the writers/directors of the series and the way they developed their characters. What were they thinking? What I fail to understand is how did an insensitive, perpetually angry Boyd ever get promoted to be a detective superintendent. At no instance has it been shown that he possesses any special deductive skills nor any radical ideas which led to solving a case. In an organization like law enforcement agency working as a team is very critical. Not jumping to conclusions and especially loosing your cool at the slightest provocation I would consider as prerequisites. Boyd fails on both these accounts.",/review/rw2130626/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is incredibly gritty, so if your a midsommer murders or poirot kind of person this will shock you.
Very realistic story lines and a lot of the episodes highlights the nadir of London's underworld. Also Sue Johnstone's transformation from benefit scrounger Barbara Royle to Dr Grace Foley is stunning and showcases what good actors they had for the whole 9 seasons.",/review/rw2130626/?ref_=tt_urv

","A copper show about solving cold cases. Within the first few minutes of the pilot there are already more contrivances than one can reasonably swallow. The acting is totally over the top resulting in an instantaneous dislike of the characters. The fast paced editing and story progression make the whole thing look like a cartoon, or worse; a parody of any and all copper shows Simon Pegg would have felt insulted not to have been considered for. The awful explanatory dialogue of the profiler who can figure out what the killer likes for breakfast by looking at his boot prints.. People, please.",/review/rw2130626/?ref_=tt_urv

","This series which stars Trevor Eve as Det. supt. Boyd who runs a Cold Case Squad, who investigate unsolved mysteries & Murders is more well known for the shortlived 1970's detective Tv series 'Shoestring' is very well made and gripping throughout the acting by co-stars Claire goose who is well known from her time at long-running hospital drama 'Casualty' & Holly Aird from 'Soldier,Soldier & Wil Johnson from many Tv series such as 'Cracker,Clocking Off and more recent 'Babyfather' Is very good and convincing But Sue Johnson From 'The Royle Family & 'Brookside' Fails to convince as a Psychological profiler but apart from that I have no complaints on what has been an outsatnding series over the last 3 years One of the better series to come out of the BBC for a long time and is well worth the license fee,instead of wasting it on mind numbingly poor TV shows such as Fame Academy - may it continue for many more series to come.",/review/rw2130626/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2015,ChristyInOregon,9," WAKING the Dead, not to be confused w/WALKING Dead
","Great cop vs senior officers vs co-workers while solving ice cold to Luke-warm cold cases. Boyd (Eve), overseer of this unique ensemble, is charged with re-investigating cold cases, yet somehow they are often (mysteriously) tasked cases where not even the bodies are cold. In an episode, that shouldn't be all that surprising, Boyd brings a case to the team where the accused pleaded guilty and is just about to be released for time served. If he had friends, this is where he would of lost them. Eve's character, Boyd would make a perfect subject for a case study of Aspergers in adults. His inability to communicate, tendency to take things literally and an inability to understand social rules and body language makes him almost impossible to befriend and Very difficult to work for or with. As an unappreciative, impatient, & arrogant boss, it's surprising his entire team (aka co-cast members) stays by his side for 4 complete seasons. Then, sudden & unexplained cast/team member changes, we see 2 series regulars leave and 2 new ones push & fight their way onto the team against Boyd's force of nature personalty trying to keep them out. Despite some frustration, it's the most thought-provoking, unpredictable, & addicting long running ""cop"" drama developed in many years. Luckily, it's available for binge watching!",/review/rw2130626/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2009,paul-1186,10," Trawled the depths of absurdity
","No spoilers here but I have been a fan since Waking the Dead started but the last series, of which only 3 have been on so far is awful. The stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series. I found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous. As a BBC licence payer, after the show I rang BBC complaints to pass on my disappointment. I'm amazed that actors of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone didn't object to the story lines. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, surly they can see it's lost all direction. It's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of Father Christmas!",/review/rw2130626/?ref_=tt_urv
