11 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,9," Brilliant!
","I had no idea what to expect when I first starting watching Severance. It not only lives up to all the hype but surpasses it. As you can see from the reviews and ratings here, people loved this show and I'm no different. I have to warn you though that's it's addicting once you start watching this and you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible. It's just such a thoughtful, original show that will have you guessing throughout the show. Along with the acting and writing the visuals are just great here. I literally can't find one negative thing to say about this incredible show. You'll have a blast watching this.",/review/rw7886105/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2022,doomedmac,9," This is brilliant
","I can't remember the last time I was so invested in a TV show. I was hooked from the first episode, and constantly impressed with the directing, visuals, acting, and plot developments. It's like a cross between Black Mirror and 1984, but it might be better than both of those works of art. This is truly something special and I COULD NOT be more excited for season 2.",/review/rw7886105/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,bosporan,10," Seminal TV, potentially a ground-breaking classic
","Severance is a study of the philosophy and ethics of self. A dry lecture? Nothing could be further from the truth, this is a tightly-written, entertaining work of TV with these weighty concepts shown through story with little or no jarring exposition dumps.",/review/rw7886105/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2022,UniqueParticle,10," To me it's a masterpiece
","If you think about it in a deeper sense the Severance corporation is a metaphor of for how trapped workers are in their job, that's my theory. I love it all I'm surprised a few hated it something about waiting for something that's ridiculous or they know the nothing, seems to be a buildup and a lot to learn about the series regardless the show is magnificent! The thriller aspect is glorious and I'm a couple episodes in. When the show first released it had a 7.2 and jumped to 8.2 that's well deserved!",/review/rw7886105/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2022,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,10," Very Original
","I loved this Apple + series very much. First of all, the subject is very original and high quality. The acting is just perfect. The script is great, the music is great. The episodes progress slowly, but they are always exciting, and the season finale was simply great. I can't find anything else to say. I'm waiting the other seasons...",/review/rw7886105/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2022,DukeEman,9," Waiting for Mark...
","How I would love to go home after work and not remember a damn thing! If that was the case, work attendance would be at an all time high. With no stress or anxiousness about work, you'll just show up, because that's what you are paid to do. But that's the pros, as for the cons...",/review/rw7886105/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2022,Supermanfan-13,9," As good as everyone says it is!
","Severance is every bit as good as everyone says it is. All you have to do is read through the reviews and look the rating to see how much people think of this series. It's on every ""best shows of 2022"" list out there for a reason and will absolutely be nominated for a ton of awards! Adam Scott leads an amazing cast who all do a fantastic job. It's just such an original show that will keep you wanting more. The first episode may start a little slow for some but stick with it because I promise that you won't regret it. If you stay with it I guarantee it will become one of your favorite shows of the year. I'm so glad they already decided to pick it up for future seasons!",/review/rw7886105/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2022,mkayseryan,9," Impressive
","I expected a comedy because of who the lead is , the first minute in you can just feel this show has immense quality behind it there has to be a team that actually cares about what they put on the screen. The first 3-4 minutes gives you a scary idea of the world of the show and I loved it. The direction is simple but the tone , writing score and atmosphere is perfectly done .",/review/rw7886105/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2022,MoistMovies,10," This could be the start of something great. **Update, from 8 to 10 by ep 9. Next big hit show if sanity still prevails these days.
","Edit* Episode 9 S1 is one of the greatest TV eps I've seen from a serialised show, still telling the story but it shines so much brighter. Ben Stiller directed it personally. And deserves awards and recognition for it.",/review/rw7886105/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2022,lee_eisenberg,9," separating your mind means separating the you you are
","""Severance"" is one of the most disturbing shows that you'll ever see. The sad thing is that so many corporations do this sort of thing to people, turning them into mere cogs in the machine.",/review/rw7886105/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2023,DanTheButler,," A slow show that does not disappoint
","Giving me just enough interest every episode to hold my attention, Severance also melted my mind. I don't think I've ever been so drawn to a show that I can't wait for its next season. It's a very wild direction from Stiller, who I never expected to deliver such masterful greatness.",/review/rw7886105/?ref_=tt_urv

20 March 2022,MongoLloyd,10," Just what the doctor ordered.
","I was ready to completely give up on episodic shows and then this happened, an actual diamond of a show among formulaic, recycled, regurgitated, pandering piffle. The production design and cinematography is inspiring and the cast is excellent. Narratively speaking, it's about as engaging and compelling as anything I'd consider a ""best"" example of any screened entertainment I've ever seen. Which means, it'll probably not be renewed for a 2nd season because it's just too original and interesting for American audiences.",/review/rw7886105/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2022,julieshotmail,10," Season 1 and it's an instant classic
","Following ""Severance"" for the past two months as each weekly episode drops reminds you of just how wonderful it is to witness things as they unfold for the first time. Well-cast, brilliantly-directed and edited, with one of the most spellbinding opening sequences in recent TV history, ""Severance"" is the perfect blend of Sci-fi, human interest, mystery, dystopia, and dark comedic undertones. ""Black Mirror"" is the only comparison that comes to mind but that show falls under the anthology category, therefore ""Severance"" is quite unlike any TV series you've ever seen before. As the mystery unfolds, you can't help but think about the layers upon layers of possibilities and various implications. While the early episodes may appear ho-hum, buzzing slowly, they are actually intricately developing each textured character if you pay close attention, positioning you for a satisfying payoff. Every actor stands out in their own right, from the trusty lead Adam Scott to veterans Patricia Arquette, John Torturo, Christopher Walken to Tramell Tillman as Milchick, my surprise favorite. This show is complex, and so for those who have not seen this yet and want to be entertained (Defiant Jazz!) and mentally stimulated at the same time, I recommend not waiting much longer to start S1E1!",/review/rw7886105/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2022,Joshumms,8," Offbeat and interesting!
","Very interesting show, it's always unsettling and you never feel like what's going on is normal. There's always so many things that you are questioning and it keeps you engaged and interested. There's some dark, offbeat humor mixed in as well. Great acting and music and an offbeat unsettling style, very excited for the rest of the series.",/review/rw7886105/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,leesimon-26357,10," Beautiful, thrilling and mysterious. Must see!
","After a single viewing, this has already become one of my all-time favorite series. I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys ""workplace corporate conglomerate mystery"" types of series.",/review/rw7886105/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,groundzero-273-397110,10," For now, this show is a 10/10 for me and I hope it stays that way after season 2.
","This show was so good, one of the best I have seen this year for sure! The whole idea is very original, and the story development is so good and exciting. I just wanted to play the next episode right away after the previous one finished.",/review/rw7886105/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2022,grahamvandyke,10," This. Is. Incredible.
","There really aren't enough positive things to say about this potential masterpiece of art. I want to go on record as saying if the show manages to keep this quality up for it's entire run length, this will be the first show I have watched since Breaking Bad to be as close to perfection as possible.",/review/rw7886105/?ref_=tt_urv

","Severance is incredible, yes it's a slow burn from episode one but each episode keeps you enthralled with the excellent characters and tidbits of reveals thru to the season finale, never have I been so gripped to the edge of my seat with any show as I was with episode 9, literally shouting at the screen ""show him a photo"".",/review/rw7886105/?ref_=tt_urv

","Smashed the first two episodes and look forward to more. Looks amazing and feels claustrophobic, there is a real visual separation between the work and home self. Dialogue is witty and sharp, the fact that Ben Stiller directed this blows my mind. Great TV to kick off 2022.",/review/rw7886105/?ref_=tt_urv
