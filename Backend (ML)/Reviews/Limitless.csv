23 April 2022,Edeards,," You forget they're actors.
",The negative reviews on this show because you don't like the people and circumstances they're based off is what's ruining the rating aggregate on this site.,/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2022,HorrorFan6969,8," This and « Severance » making Apple TV the streaming service of the year !
",This is not a series for everyone don't read me wrong. The acting is amazing but the theme if you give a chance Is even better. It's shot like a movie but it's 8 episodes of nearly 60 minutes full. It's really a good and strong story. Actors give their heart and soul. Jared Leto is unrecognizable and I can't see someone else do that role. Anna Hathaway at first I was not sure. And at episode 3. She was getting a lot more and feel like she is the principal character. It's a good series / film kinda. I'm just happy with Apple. It give me the time of my life. The quality is there.,/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2022,jreeders518,8," ONE THING IS FOR SURE:
",Mrs. Nuemann is as nutty as a fruitcake. Imagine turning your child over to her for their education? He is just a money hungry carnival barker. He reminded me of those traveling gypsy shows. Just anything for money and power.,/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2022,awwburreee,8," Dont get why this has so many bad reviews
",I love this show and the acting isnt bad at all. Interesting look at how a brilliant idea can go so bad. Interesting and entertaining and jared leto Is very convincing as a foreigner. Worth the watch.,/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2022,Joshumms,7," Good story, some frustrating aspects.
","The first episode is great, it sets up the story of WeWork in such an engaging and energetic way with upbeat music and awesome monologues from Jared Leto's character. The performances are excellent and the story is interesting.",/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2022,admin-802,10," Keeps getting better and better!
","If you followed the WeWork story, you know how compelling this was in real life - and now as a TV show it's not just compelling, it is addictive! It's about innovation, charisma, how to do business and more importantly -- how to not do business. Incredible acting from Jared Lato - he is truly magnificent! Crazy story based on real life! I find myself waiting for the next episode, to learn how much crazier can this get!",/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2022,tim-137-552735,8," It works.
","Great story and even more so because it's true. That so many bought into the spiel is incredible in itself. Wall St so called experts all threw money at them, and Theranos. That's what's really scary. But one quibble. Adam Neumann was 6-5"". It makes a difference. He dominated people and rooms. It would have been good to have an actor that tall...",/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2022,jakethesnake-42007,7," Great acting one of apples best
",Apple has had some problems with there shows and this may be one of the better ones. The acting is superb it's hard to get past the arrogant characters but that's what it is. The plot is fascinating tho at times it drags on.,/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,ferdinand1932,6," Manipulation
","Assuming this is mostly accurate, and many TV/movie biographies use too much license for dramatic effect, then it is quite disturbing.",/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2022,thejdrage,7," A lesson in how to spot a manipulator
","The character of Adam in WeWork was SO intense and fast talking and in a mostly loud monotone, and was so brutally manipulative, it made me nervous. VERY nervous.",/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2022,guilhermecoelhorocha-66-787211,9," JARED LETO IS OUTSTANDING. JUST OUTSTANDING.
",He is a show of his own.,/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2022,RamseyReviews,8," ACTING A++ (Leto Is A Star)
","Anyone who says the acting is bad in this show, doesn't understand what an actor is. I know this can be hard to understand but acting is the art of playing a character, whom which you may or may not like in real life. Just because Draco Malfoy is an evil prick, doesn't mean Tom Felton sucks at acting. And just because the character is a crazy lunatic who blows billions of dollars and runs a company into the depths of hell doesn't mean that Leto doesn't do a damn good job at portraying him. I mean for the love of god people, do you even know who the real Adam Neumann is? Have you ever seen him talk? Or walk in a room? JARED LETO IS ADAM NEUMANN. Jesus people. He's a star.",/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2022,solange-279-894809,8," Jared Leto is phenomenal
","At first I was a little disturbed by his accent but later I got it and the series became better and better. Excelent. Acting from Leto ( what an actor!) and Hathaway. Impressive writing , perfect dialogs, correct directing. It's worthy. History from the present tense.",/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2022,valerianodellalonga,9," So far a must see
","I've watched the first three episodes: great acting, impressive filmography, very interesting plot, all well directed.",/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2022,MReed542,5," Unlikeable, unbearable people who don't get what they deserve
","So here's the thing here. It's easy to blame Leto and Hathaway for the irritated and annoyed feelings produced by this show but I'm pretty sure they're doing an excellent job portraying two real life narcissistic asses who don't give a damn about anyone and who think they are God's gift to the planet. What I hate most in this world is to see people like this rewarded for that behavior and so far after 5 episodes that's exactly what this is. Hours of watching a couple of really unlikeable people walk over anyone and everyone, recklessly destroying people for sport it seems, on their quest to get rich all while flaunting their elitist, entitled attitudes. Sadly the promise that they crash and get what they deserve is never realized because this couple in real life is still worth billions despite their ""crash."" Watch if you must but take your blood pressure medicine beforehand. I just wish that Apple and other film/series makers would spend more of their energy on stories where the good guys win (so to speak).",/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2022,cscott2331,7," Just a few reasons it's not a 10 for me.
","First and foremost I HATED Rebekah. If she was actually this bad in real life, I'd have killed her if I was forced to be around her. Guess this speaks to Anne's acting chops, because I like her in other rolls. Second it aggravates the hell out of me that they walk away Scott free and with plenty of money. So many suffered at the hands of these absolute utter narcissists. Like these characters gross me out so badly that I almost couldn't finish. I've loved Jared Leto since My So Called Life, so again, it speaks to his abilities because I hated him too. Anywho, it's worth a watch and I guess you have to be sort of next level crazy and narcissistic to even dream of making a multi billion dollar company. I just think of how many people could've benefited from this idea, had he just shut his stupid mouth and listened to someone. The employees first and foremost. They gave their lives to these people. Sure, hoping to benefit but also hoping to build something meaningful. Just once more so I can get it out...Rebekah SUUUUUCCCKKKSSSS!!",/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2022,paul-2148,1," The documentary was very good. This is not.
","All I know about WeWork I learned from the documentary. What I learned was that the ""CEO"" was just another conman, but he fancied himself more of a cult leader. It's a story very similar to Dropout, the story about the Theranos creator, who likewise raised millions in VC money without having a viable product or service. They are both modern day snake oil salesman. It's fitting that these story's are becoming common in our modern culture, where teenage girls can become millionaires overnight by dancing provocatively on TikTok.",/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2022,loozzotys,9," Jared Leto looks exactly like a young Jim Carey
",Much better tha expected. The main role could have been played by a young Jim Carey. The acting is good. Goor editing. Good cinematography. I worked for an Israeli American guy almost same as the main character before. He lied alot but convinced alot of people in business and for investments also during the dotcom days. If you ever worked in the dotcom days or in a tech company you would understand this tv series..,/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2022,AsianTalentHollywood,5," Trying too hard...
","Even Jared Leto, a great actor who is trying to prove what we already know is trying too hard to be relevant and raise this project to award status. It's dull and overdone. It was painful getting through the first episode.",/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2022,lucifer_over_tinseltown,6," Leto crashes the Room
","Listen, I think Jared Leto is a transcendent, generational talent and all of that jazz. That said, about six minutes into the first episode I started feeling a queasy sense of familiarity with the character he was portraying/persona he was channeling. It wasn't Adam Neumann, whom Leto is a half a foot shorter than, either. Nor was it Alfred E. Neuman. Nope, Leto in this role is a spot on, dead ringer for none other than Tommy Wiseau's ""Johnny"" in the infamous, often odious film ""The Room."" He must have really been studying him. I think Tommy may have him dead to rights on gimmick infringement. Leto can be a bit of a prankster. Still a solid portrayal, just of the wrong dude. Hathaway has some presence here, too. Her acting is on the level of Gwyneth Paltrow's. All in all, I found the show to be a trenchant, often entertaining, wholly excoriating analysis of narcissism and avarice. George Carlin's quote about the American Dream quickly comes to mind, i.e. You have to be asleep to still believe in it.",/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2022,ZiggyZane87,7," Two of Hollywoods most insufferable actors playing two of the worlds most insufferable 'entrepeneurs'
","Casting choice was genius in my opinion. The show is a fairly interesting depiction of how hyper-capitalist, money hungry society bends over backwards for narcissistic conmen and how desperately we are to believe that they might hold some sort of secret to success/meaning in life - something we all (hopefully) understand to be false at this point frankly. The best part about the show is just how unlikeable the characters are. It's refreshing to watch a show that doesn't in any way try to redeem truly insufferable people. Otherwise pretty dry.",/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2022,rklemm05,1," Way too long, repetitive and the characters are obnoxious
","Jared Leto plays Adam Neuman, an unbearable moron who thinks he can bullsh... his way into anything in life because he's oh so irresistible and above everyone and everything. Yes, the guy has a super power: that of spending money he never earned and spit on anyone who'd dare to doubt his unfailing instincts. He'd like to pass himself off as a visionary, when actually he's just an immature whimsy fraud.",/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2022,meezerfan123,10," One of the best things I've ever seen on streaming
","Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway are so good in their roles that you forget they are Jared and Anne. You truly believe they are Adam and Rebekah and that they are crazy in love, and crazy period. The writing is excellent and I care about the minor characters just as much as the stars. It's always a little challenging to dramatize a true story but this is so good that I'm excited every time Friday comes around and I have a new episode to enjoy. I hate to see it end!",/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2022,petercarlsson-92297,1," Quite boring
","Over acting. Sex with the clothes on. Simplification. Uninteresting characters. Hmm... what more? Well it's not very exciting to watch, to be honest, even a bit boring. And that was only the first episode.",/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2022,bullet-myvalentine-353-90337,6," Meh
","Don't get me wrong but I absolutely love Anne Hathaway and Jared Leto is a good actor. But I couldn't get passed this, I couldn't finish it. The episode is kinda boring and too long and nothing happens that excites you to keep going.",/review/rw8363047/?ref_=tt_urv
