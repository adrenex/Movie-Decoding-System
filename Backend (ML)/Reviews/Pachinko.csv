","Yes, it's lurid. Yes, it's trashy. Yes, it doesn't stand up to close scrutiny. And yes, if you're the sort of person who specialises in spotting plot twists, then you're probably going to do well here.",/review/rw6784382/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2006,The_Void,8," Seductive, slick and sexy; great entertainment!
","Wild Things is a fantastic example of what can be achieved by not worrying about substance and having a film play for straight entertainment value. Here we have a film that takes elements such as beautiful stars, beautiful locations and a bucket load of plot twists and blends it all into a highly enjoyable film experience. Of course, Wild Things doesn't always come across very realistically and, at times even, it's downright ridiculous; but it's done in such a way that it doesn't matter, and because of that we have a film that can do what it wants. The film is helmed by John McNaughton, who had his first success with the cult horror flick Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. It has to be said that the scene setting and way that the plot moves is somewhat ham-fisted, as sometimes it's painfully obvious that certain sections of the film exist only to give it another selling point; the argument that starts out between Denise Richards and Neve Campbell beside a swimming pool being a case in point. However, McNaughton makes good of these selling points, and for every three way sex scene and absurd plot twist, the film gains an extra point for trashy entertainment value.",/review/rw6784382/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2002,tfrizzell,," A Little Something for Everyone.
","Wow. ""Wild Things"" is one of those trash masterpieces that is just so clever, so hot and so fun that it becomes one of the most interesting and under-rated films of the 1990s. The rich Denise Richards and the very poor Neve Campbell each accuse high school teacher Matt Dillon of rape, but there is something that is not quite right. Enter detectives Kevin Bacon and Daphne Rubin-Vega. They both doubt that the case is as simple as it seems. Boy are they right. The investigation leads to court where it is made clear by Dillon's attorney (Bill Murray) that the case lacks any real evidence to convict Dillon to prosecutor Robert Wagner's despair. The whole thing was a fabrication to get to Richards' mother's riches (Theresa Russell). But of course this is just the start and there will be double-, triple- and even quadruple-crossing and it is skewered who are good and who are evil or is anyone good? A brilliant screenplay by Stephen Peters and Alfred Hitchcock-styled direction by John McNaughton makes ""Wild Things"" a trashy, but highly impressive cinematic winner. 4 stars out of 5.",/review/rw6784382/?ref_=tt_urv

25 October 2005,hu675,8," Kinky erotic thriller is fun and extremely entertaining.
","In Blue Bay's elite beach communities and into the murky waters of the Everglades, you would expect nothing beyond this venture until a guidance counselor (Matt Dillon) is accused of raping two high school students (Neve Campbell and Denise Richards). While they are two detectives on the cast (Kevin Bacon and Daphne Rubin-Vega), they find out there's more than meets the eye in the mystery of deceit, sex and greed.",/review/rw6784382/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2001,mentalcritic,," Much more intelligent than it is often given credit for...
","During the very limited theatrical run that Wild Things recieved here (I think it was gone in about three weeks), a lot of the reviews and publicity created the impression that this was a soap opera sex thriller. I guess that's an easy approach to take when summing this film up, since its two female leads featured in Party Of Five and episodes of Doogie Howser (man what an awful show that was), not to mention that one of the male leads would be doing well to act his way out of a wet paper bag. The problem with that is that it is just too easy, and easy answer is exactly the sort of thing that this film goes out of its way to avoid. It is not trying to be a modern Hitchcock, it is not trying to be another Basic Instinct, it is just trying to tell a story.",/review/rw6784382/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2004,jtindahouse,10," Denise Richards Stunning!!!
","Magnificent storyline. While the basic storyline of what was happening was so simple it was so original as well. All the twists and turns kept you interested throughout the movie which is what people really want to see from a movie, not something that drags on and on about nothing and then finishes with the same kind of ending that every other movie does. Neve Campbell played a different type of role to what she's used to but did it very well. Matt Dillon (playing Sam Lambardo) was excellent although the role could have been cast slightly better maybe with George Clooney. Kevin Bacon gave another stellar performance and kept you interested in his role throughout the movie. But without a doubt the the best performance was Denise Richards who was absolutely perfect for the role. She couldn't have been cast better from anyone in the world. Her beauty made this movie what it was. I think a lot of people would consider Matt Dillon the luckiest man in the world.",/review/rw6784382/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you ever thought a crime thriller could be filmed in Aaron Spelling manner, you've got your movie. Everybody is so good looking and the plot twists more than Chubby Checker. However, in the end almost everything falls into place. You get your suspense, excitement, intrigue and lots of close-ups on some gorgeous hunks. Not so bad at all.",/review/rw6784382/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2004,malkane316,8," oooh Neve
","Funny, raunchy, tongue in cheek, blatantly politically incorrect, Wild Things is a change from McNaughton's 'Henry' days. I'm sure school has never looked so attractive to any prospective teachers when students will offer to wash your car for you, suds'n'all. If none of you know, Neve Campbell is my favourite actress ever. Not that that makes me biased, she has made plenty of bad movies, but this isn't one of them. Lots of twists, perhaps too many, and enough sleaze to satisfy most men and boys, just watch the glorious threesome scene to see what I mean. Don't expect any deep message here, unless it's 'don't trust your lawyer if he's Bill Murray', but then again, it's not that kind of movie. Bacon and Richards are also good, though i'm not a fan of Richards. if you like her, you'll probably love this. 8 out of 10",/review/rw6784382/?ref_=tt_urv

","I remember when WILD THINGS came out on first release; for some reason, it never appealed to me. Back then I only cared about horror films like SCREAM, and this sleazy-looking thriller didn't have what it took to whet my appetite back then. Fourteen years later my tastes have broadened a great deal, so I decided to check it out.",/review/rw6784382/?ref_=tt_urv

","SPOILERS - This is one of those films where every time you think you understand what's going on, a new twist comes to light. At first guidance counselor Matt Dillon is accused of rape by a student, Denise Richards, and Neve Campbell, the dimwitted one, later comes forward to say she was raped too. At the trial, Neve is cracked by lawyer Bill Murray's cross exam, admits that nothing ever happened, Denise put her up to it because she was upset with Dillon. They plea-bargain with Dillon and give him a multi-million settlement not to press perjury charges.   However, less than half of the movie was over.",/review/rw6784382/?ref_=tt_urv

","As my general comment, Wild Things is a slick and fun thriller, but that's comes from my second appreciation for it. My first experience with it is so dizzy and makes a headache to me. The plot, ala Hitchcock flicks, is so complicated. I have no enough satisfaction on it, so I decide to give it one more chance. Well, this time, after understanding the plot structure, make me more relax and fun to enjoy it. Therefore, my recommendation is, better watch it two times.",/review/rw6784382/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wild Things absolutely wowed me the first time I watched it. I had no knowledge of what it was about, actually, and so I had no knowledge of what to expect. When I saw it for the first time I just had to watch it a second time right after that, to be honest, because I was astounded at how much I enjoyed it. Although I did not own the movie, you know that I went back to rent it a couple of more times because it was just so wonderful, and finally when I got the chance to buy it, I did, and now I have watched it numerous times on numerous occasions because it truly is an excellent movie that I can enjoy with every watch.",/review/rw6784382/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2004,paul2001sw-1,3," Wildly bad
","'Wild Things' is a hard film to comment on, basically because it is two films; or at least, one film in disguise.  It commences as an ""issue-based"" melodrama, except that two things seem odd: the pacing is too fast (how is the story going to last the movie?) and the bizarre score seems more fitted to a comedy.  Sure enough, this ""straight"" drama is wrapped up, only to subside into a larger thriller; a thriller in which twists and turns of the plot come at an ever faster rate, until in the end the film's aim is clearly to make you gasp rather than care (this is particularly evident when the missing holes in the plot are explained through the perfunctory insertion of extra scenes into the closing credits).  So, to assess it we need to ask: what's the quality of the initial set-up; how good is the twisty thriller; and how well is the transition handled?  ",/review/rw6784382/?ref_=tt_urv

","I think that Wild Things was an excellent film. While I see movies for their plot, excitement, and drama, I was originally drawn to renting ""Wild Things"" by its review that I saw in my local paper (The Ann Arbor News) a few years ago... I remember that it was singled out specifically for its ""graphic sexual content and violence""... I will admit, yes, this is primarily what cause me to rent the film besides my interest in all three main actors= Neve Campbell, Denise Richards, and Matt Dillon.
