6 October 2021,SPZMaxinema,9," This should not have been cancelled!!
","The music, suspense, drama, mystery, and horror of this show was enough to make me so invested in it and care for every character (except the bad ones who are in it for their own gain). Emotional and extremely compelling, especially the first season. Brit Marling shined wonderfully.",/review/rw3645152/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2019,dlmslp1,10," Please renew
","Why Netflix? Why?! Please renew this show!!! I recently finished watching it and am obsessed with this unique world written by star Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij. The OA is so creative, mysterious, haunting, spiritual, magical, and captivating. I love the characters and really want to see more. Please save The OA.",/review/rw3645152/?ref_=tt_urv

","Both seasons are simply amazing. Everything fits... every cast member, each location and every camera angle.
Pretty sure you can watch this a second time and still discover something new.
Guys give this series a chance and a rating SO NETFLIX WILL GIVE US ANOTHAAAA SEASON!!",/review/rw3645152/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2019,nextgenerationsweden,8," Cancelled by Netflix, WHY?
","How come Netflix is choosing to cancel this show? Its make no sense at all. Great show, with great storytelling, a ""magic feeling"" you get when whatching it (as long as you take the show for what it is). Hope some other network pick it up.",/review/rw3645152/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 2021,astrid-69599,9," Please Netflix make another season!!!
",Great show. Very good storyline and acting. Unfortunately Netflix canceled this series without a proper ending. Frustrating! Why. I wonder. Why cancel a series with such good ratings.,/review/rw3645152/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2019,mayqu33n,," How is this canceled??
","I am honestly besides myself about all of this. I watched this a few months ago and ended up deeply enthralled in this storyline and was so confident that there would be a 3rd season. I was honestly so convinced that there would be a 3rd season that I never even considered the fact that it could even be canceled. Needless to say, I was shocked the other day when I heard the news that Netflix decided to cancel The OA. One of the most interesting stories out there and they decide to cancel? And not only was it interesting, but it was also insanely innovative, well done, and likely an actual original concept (never before thought of and/or executed) story that transcended both mind and space? And they decide to cancel?",/review/rw3645152/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2022,afura-78800,10," Masterpiece
","I wasn't at the beginning sure what exactly I was going to watch, but the trailer looked interesting to me so I started watching the series. The series has 2x8 episodes, 16 in total. Season 1 is some kind of preparation of season 2, so season 2 is very different from season 1, but which isn't a bad thing, since the transition from season 1 to season 2 was really well done. The actors did an incerdible good job, everyone seemed to be perfect for the role he/she was playing, I think they did a very good job with the cast.",/review/rw3645152/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2022,jhmoondance,9," A Brilliant Innovative Story.
",Well......what a deeply innovative idea with an excellent concept on time travel n different dimensions of space which captured the imagination with its gripping story. I've read a review saying the show has been cancelled n I for the life of me can not comprehend. This was full of twists n turns n packed with suspense n tension.,/review/rw3645152/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2019,lovbunni,10," Bring back the OA season 3 please!
",One of the best moving shows I have ever watched. You have got to pay close attention to watching it. It's one of those shows that if you look away for a few minutes you'll lose track of what's going on. It's a wonderful show.,/review/rw3645152/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2019,rmenzies11,10," Thrilling, Captivating, Stunning and full of Originality
","Was a breath of fresh air. I was taken aback when I first watched this show. It really affected me, in terms of it made me think after each episode. I would try and sleep at night but couldn't as it was always on my mind. The main character is simply amazing and the complexity of the story just captured me 100%. The first episode and the way it ends was just brilliant and clever. Instantly I was invested in all the main characters and their own stories and how they came together. Loved the way it was shot as it was stunning, the story has so many unanswered questions. These unanswered questions made my mind wander off when I stopped watching trying to figure out what was going on, who she really was, what had happened etc.",/review/rw3645152/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2021,sarahwolard,9," Another mind altering series thrown away by Netflix
",I don't know why they always cancel the best and most intriguing shows. It's very irritating. This was refreshing and unique. They keep garbage stuff around. I really liked this show and was looking forward to more seasons.,/review/rw3645152/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2019,satin-48250,10," Wow... Thanks to Netflix and shame on them
","Using absolute formulations is awkward but to my mind, this is the most creative series I have ever watched and I have seen many. I was first slightly annoyed and yet intrigued. I am so glad I did pursue. This show is beyond brillant. And moving. What a radiating gem! Season 1 unfolds the uniqueness of the show. Season 2 is on a whole other level. I am truly amazed.
France is so proud of its ""cultural exception"" to justify an over-subsidized entertainment industry. But it has been utterly unable to produce any series or any other TV production that would remotely touch this one.
So thank you Netflix to have allowed it to come to existence and be viewed by many. And shame on you to abort it when it was gaining so much momentum.
I really hope they come back to their senses (didn't they say that they realized their mistake when cutting short Sense8?) and let the OA unfold her journey...",/review/rw3645152/?ref_=tt_urv

",The OA left many questions to be answered behind with the first season finale and was highly appreciated by the audience. The OA's second season is quite chaotic and confusing.,/review/rw3645152/?ref_=tt_urv

",This show is one of the best I've ever seen. I've watched all 8 episodes a few times. It just leaves me wanting more. Where is season 2???,/review/rw3645152/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2019,robfollower,10," The OA does reach the thought-provoking profundity the show aims for.
","The OA season 1 is a bizarre new sci-fi world, but this show is unlike any you've seen-ludicrous and frustrating as well as beautiful and profound.",/review/rw3645152/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2018,priv-88455,9," Brilliant
","Marling writes, directs, and is the star of this transcendental and beautifully delivered mystery. The attention to detail, narrative style, and character depth are truly astounding. Prepare to be transported into the mind of Prairie/Nina. Is she delusional or is she divine?",/review/rw3645152/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2016,NateWatchesCoolMovies,10," The very definition of unique. A masterpiece.
","I always try to find unique and original projects when choosing films and shows to watch, for we live in a time where many titles you see out there are sequels, nostalgia reboots or spinoffs. These aren't bad things per se, but it's also important to break new ground and produce organic material, something which Netflix has a fairly glowing track record for. Tapping the creative well that is the mind of young female director/actress/producer Brit Marling, the platform has given her the chance to tell one of the most striking, beautiful and altogether astonishing pieces of work I've ever seen from the long form storytelling format. Earlier this year, Stranger Things knocked me flat, and recently Westworld has captivated my attention and imagination. But The OA has done something different for me; stirred my soul in a way that few creative pieces can, with a story so unpredictable that it starts to feel like the forces of nature at work, forking off into tributary sections of narrative that you would never, ever have been able to to surmise ahead of the reveals.

","Mixing fantasy and science.
Both seasons fitting like a tight puzzle.
Left on the edge of your seat at the end of both seasons finale.

12 April 2019,UniqueParticle,10," Brilliant, captivating, thought provoking & bizarre!
",I love this show so much. I'm rewatching it years after already seeing it years ago; even then I considered it among my favorites purely because I love alternate universes/crossing dimensions or anything philosophical! I like to pretend I live in alternate universe cause I'm quirky & don't fit it in most places.,/review/rw3645152/?ref_=tt_urv
