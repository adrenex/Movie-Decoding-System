","Leaving the cinema last night I found myself arguing with half the audience about the movie. Half of them said the movie sucked, and the other half (myself included) loved it. Now, this is a type of movie that will divide the audience so much that there will not be a middle. One will either love it or hate it (which seems to be a pattern in recent Hollywood history). By just watching the trailer it was clear as day that this will not be a masterpiece or a rebirth of Stocker's fable. So I ask a very plausible question: What did you expect?",/review/rw3693161/?ref_=tt_urv

","In 1442, the Prince Vlad, the Impaler (Luke Evans) rules the Transylvania after serving the Turkish Sultan as a soldier since he was a child. Vlad is happily married with his beloved wife Mirena (Sarah Gadon) and their son, Ingeras (Art Parkinson), is their pride and joy. When Vlad and his soldiers find a Turkish helmet in the river, he goes with two men to a cave in the Broke Tooth Mountain expecting to find Turkish scouts. However they stumble upon a deadly creature (Charles Dance) that kills the two men, but Vlad succeeds to escape alive from the cave. He learns that the creature is a vampire.",/review/rw3693161/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2014,Theo Robertson,7," Good Enough As Long As You Don't Think Of It As A Horror Film
",I remember the 1992 version of Dracula by Francis Ford Coppola and thinking that the best part of that version was the anti-heroic Prince Vlad defending Europe against the Ottoman invasion . I do believe there is a market for a historical epic featuring the true life story of Vlad the impaler . This version from 2014 does come close to it in some ways but let's be honest and say no one is going to watch any movie with Dracula in the title unless it features a vampire in the title role and one wonders how many people might have been disappointed by the marketing if not the title alone ? ,/review/rw3693161/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2018,classicsoncall,8," ""My name is Dracula, Son of the Devil!""
","The name of Dracula has for many decades been known as the name of a fictional vampire, but prior to that and for many centuries, was considered the nickname of Vlad III, or Vlad the Impaler. His father was Vlad Dracul, 'the Dragon'; 'Dracula' was another form of the name used to describe the son of Dracul. In modern Romania, Dracul means 'the Devil', and went a long way to contribute to Vlad's reputation. This 'origin' story of Dracula actually did a pretty good job of explaining all that.

",It's a Hollywood movie - entertainment - not a history lesson! The story borrows heavily from the real life Vlad Tepes and his real battles BUT it is not an accurate depiction of it - the film doesn't pretend to be either.

22 August 2015,SnoopyStyle,4," problematic origins story
","In 1442, the Turks enslaved 1000 boys from Transylvania and used as Janissary troops. Prince Vlad was one of those boys and his ruthless exploits would earn his nickname Vlad the Impaler (Luke Evans). He would eventually rule Transylvania peacefully as a vassal to the Ottoman empire. Mehmed II (Dominic Cooper) is marching on Venice and demands 1000 boys from Transylvania. Vlad keeps his vow to his wife Mirena (Sarah Gadon) and battles the Turks rather than send his son. Vlad goes to Broke Tooth Mountain to seek help from the Master Vampire (Charles Dance). After Vlad drinks the Vampire's blood, he gets his supernatural powers. If he resists drinking human blood for 3 days, he would return to be human. If he drinks, he would be a vampire forever and could be called upon to help his maker one day.",/review/rw3693161/?ref_=tt_urv

12 October 2014,CastorTroyOnCom,8," Everyone will enjoy this flick except history buffs
","If your looking for a good action flick with a decent plot this is the movie for you. With a 90min runtime I was expecting this movie to feel ""rushed"", it felt far from that. The action was great, it did not disappoint with all the cool vampire abilities you see in the trailer, especially transforming into a group of bats. Being a Dracula movie there are things you have to expect, yes he receives his power by drinking blood, having all the vulnerabilities as every vampire (which they do very good in this movie) but the way this movie makes you root for Vlad(Dracula) you actually find yourself engulfed in the movie wanting him to overcome the darkness and win. However if you are a history buff and it irks you when movies take real life people and change their history for a movie, you will not enjoy this because it is loosely based off Vlad the Impaler.

","This shows us the fearsome Vlad the Impaler cum Dracula as a sensitive husband and father and it's just repugnant, an apostasy. He's a prince with no army to protect his people, right. Alot of situations in this film are transparently contrived. Watched it with my wife, I would've bailed halfway through but she wanted to see it through for the poetic romance I think, ugh.

8 October 2014,Troy_Campbell,3," Charmless, stupid and devoid of a heart.
","The most recent in a long line of shiny, CGI-laden retellings of classic movie properties, this attempted franchise-starter is charmless, narratively stupid and devoid of a beating heart much like the eponymous vamp. Swapping the Gothic noir of the 1932 Universal original, the genuine horror of Hammer's 1958 redux and even the stylish chills of Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 incarnation, all for a medieval-meets-supernatural romp (sound like a popular TV show much?) Dracula Untold lacks any real bite. Debutant director Gary Shore shows his inexperience with hollow set pieces, a muddled tone and editing so quick and messy during the action sequences only a crack head would be able to see what's going on. Luke Evans admirably gives his all to inject life into his Dracula, now a tormented anti-hero, and Charles Dance is joyfully menacing as an ancient bloodsucker, yet the acting plaudits end here. The usually reliable Dominic Cooper completes an embarrassing 2014 (after the woeful Need for Speed flopped at the box office and Reasonable Doubt went straight to DVD) with his cringe-worthy turn as the antagonist, whilst Sarah Gadon is vapidly conventional as Dracula's nubile young wife. If things weren't bad enough, there's a slapdash epilogue that reeks of studio pressure to leave it open for a sequel. A stake in the heart would be preferable.",/review/rw3693161/?ref_=tt_urv

4 October 2014,The-Sarkologist,3," A rather boring Dracula prequel
","Have you ever been to a movie where the trailers really grab you and then discover that you have already seen all of the decent scenes? Quite a lot would probably be your reply, and I know that it would be mine as well. Well, this film, for me at least, was one of those films. The effects were pretty good but other than that I really didn't like it. In fact, I would probably go as far to say that I found it really boring (though maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I have moved one seat across because I ended up sitting next to one of those really annoying people that simply insist on taking up as much space as possible). Once again we have a retelling of the Dracula story with much better special effects than the previous one, however this is also one of those movies that essentially sets the scene for the later story (as immortalised in Bram Stoker's book). Basically the film is set during the Turkish invasion of Eastern Europe and even though Vlad initially drove the Turks out of his land, he still is paying tribute to them (which I found odd because I had the impression that he had defeated them, and I feel that they should have got rid of the whole tribute scene). They then demand a thousand children (including Vlad's own son) as tribute and that sets the legendary impailer on his course to make a deal with the powers of darkness to save his land (and his family). I won't go much deeper into the story than that, except that it does deal with the question of whether the means does justify the ends (and it suggests that it doesn't because even though the film isn't a tragedy per se, it still tells us that Vlad damns himself by making that deal). In fact we are reminded a number of times during the film that he did not make the deal for his own purposes but so that he might save his people, and while he does end up driving out the Turks (no spoiler needed there because I am sure we all know what to expect in relation to that part of the film) he condemns himself to eternal damnation in the form of a vampire. As I said, I wasn't really all that impressed with the film. There seemed to be too many stretches were nothing seems to be happening, and I also wonder why he did not destroy many more Turks at night, but had to wait for the last minute to say 'hey, I haven't got much time, so I better do it all now). It was also incredibly predictable (though since it is a 'prequel' we all know where it ends anyway) in that I worked out what was going to happen as soon as the elder vampire opened his mouth. So, in the end, I would probably suggest that unless you really, really, like vampire movies (which I don't) then there are probably better things to spend your money on.",/review/rw3693161/?ref_=tt_urv
