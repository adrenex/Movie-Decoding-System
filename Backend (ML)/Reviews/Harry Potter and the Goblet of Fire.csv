12 November 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," A film that will never age and you will always have a place for in your heart
","What's Eating Gilbert Grape is one of those little treasures that for the most part most people do know about, mainly due to Leonardo DiCaprio's knock out performance as Arnie Grape. But both he and Johnny had this great chemistry together that made what could have been a very boring movie into an extremely touching piece of film that meant more and more to me as I grew up. When I was a kid and watched this film, I just loved laughing at all of Arnie's jokes not realizing why he was so silly. As a teenager I could start to relate to having a little more pressure with a job and school. Then as an adult and having my mother become ill, I could relate completely to Gilbert in his frustrations of just wanting to be young and enjoy his life. I think that's why this film is special to a lot of people, those who have felt the added little pressures in life and makes you think on what's eating at you? This is the story of Gilbert Grape.",/review/rw5748535/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2010,bkoganbing,8," Grape Family Values
","Johnny Depp whose penchant for quirky and unusual characters is a hallmark of his career plays a fairly normal kid in the title role of What's Eating Gilbert Grape. What's eating him is that he's stuck in the role of family breadwinner, guardian to his younger siblings, and in a most nowhere job. The future isn't looking up.",/review/rw5748535/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2014,classicsoncall,8," ""We've always had a reasonable deal on pickles.""
","Until today, my impression of the movie's title was that it was asking a question. It never occurred to me that the story was in fact trying to answer one. For Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp), life is an imponderable existence, trapped as he is in a fatherless family with a mentally challenged younger brother (Leonardo DiCaprio), an obese mother (Darlene Cates) whose dimensions threaten the very foundation of their home, and a pair of sisters (Laura Harrington, Mary Kate Schellhardt) who find it difficult to maintain some semblance of normality in a community that considers the family a spectator attraction. But if you think about it, they might not have been the oddest characters living in Endora. The town also features a harmless joke mortician (Crispin Glover), a sad and lonely woman trapped in a loveless marriage (Mary Steenburgen), and a family friend (John C. Reilly) who insists that the soon to arrive Burger Barn is nothing short of cutting edge in the fast food industry. Into this mix arrives a free spirit angel (Juliette Lewis) who tries to help Gilbert realize his self proclaimed goal of being a good person. The film has it's absurd moments along with the bittersweet, and it was for that reason I found the marching band's choice of song to greet the Burger Barn as truly ironic - 'This Magic Moment'. By the time the picture is over, one realizes that even if our hero Gilbert has 'got nowhere to go', he's always been exactly where he needed to be.",/review/rw5748535/?ref_=tt_urv

26 February 2008,Lechuguilla,9," Trapped
","Small American towns nurture kindness and big hearts, as personified by Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp), a twenty year old guy who heads a loving but difficult family of two younger sisters, a mentally retarded younger brother named Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio), and their obese momma (Darlene Cates). These are humble, unpretentious common folks who do the best they can. But life in a small town in Iowa is hard, and it can be frustrating and confining. At times, you can feel ... trapped.",/review/rw5748535/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2006,Vomitron_G,9," The family that binds us
","Truly, this is one beautiful movie. It doesn't go for cheap tears but in the end you must feel something, otherwise you simply don't have a heart. It's about a town, Endora, where nothing ever happens. In that town live the Grapes, a fatherless family that consists of a mother of elephant-like proportions, two sisters and two brothers (one of them being retarded).",/review/rw5748535/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2006,Anonymous_Maxine,10," A change of pace for almost everyone involved results in spectacular success.
","I recently stumbled upon the last half of one of those Top 50 Child Stars TV shows, which had a segment on Leonardo DiCaprio, showing interviews with him when he first started acting and would make jokes about how famous and rich he was, having had no way of knowing how astronomically rich and famous he would go on to be. Anyway, the show described his performance in What's Eating Gilbert Grape as one of his most charming, which turned out to be a tremendous understatement.",/review/rw5748535/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2004,Idolprincess,8," Very well-done
","I thought I wouldn't like this. I decided to see it because I'm a fan of Johnny Depp who appeared in some of my favorite movies [ Edward Scissorhands, Benny and Joon, etc. ] I knew what the plot was: a guy who lives with his 15 year old sister, his 18 year old mentally disabled brother who could die at any time and his morbidly obese mother always has to do everything for his family and something happens that changes his life. It sounded like it was a typical sappy drama. I usually hate dramas like that. Movies in which the only point is to feel bad for the characters. But this one was quite different.

3 January 2004,demelza3000,," DiCaprio Is Excellent
","I saw this movie a couple of years ago and have seen it many times since. I have worked with special needs children for nearly 20 years, and Leonardo DiCaprio gives an excellent performance as a mentally challenged teenager. His mannerisms and vocal inflection as Arnie were dead on.  I had never been a DiCaprio fan until I watched this movie, now I see him in a completely different light.  He SO deserved an Oscar for this performance.  It puts that whole Dustin Hoffman/Rainman performance to shame.",/review/rw5748535/?ref_=tt_urv

21 August 2020,Kirpianuscus,," a mirror
","It is one of films with high potential to be a sort of personal experience. Or reflection of it. Because, in delicate- magnificent manner , it gives a touching story about family and its strong solidarity, about sibling connections, about personal life in middle of the needs and expectations of the othrs, about nuances of love. Poetic in profound sense, it is , obvious, more than a good film. The performances are great and the job of Darlene Cates impressive in high manner. It is that film being more a so familiar song or poem or ball of memories. Because, it is just a large mirror of soul states, small, basic experiences .",/review/rw5748535/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2005,Penwah,10," Knocked me over!
","One of the delights of having raised a family and having more time to yourself s that you get to go back and watch all the movies you missed. I am just now getting to explore the actors whose careers have been postponed, in our lives, by Ninja Turtles and Disney. I fell in lust with Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean and he made me a real fan in Finding Neverland. But in Gilbert Grape, he won my heart completely. This man can act with his eyes. The biggest surprise was Leo DiCaprio as Arnie. Amazing, and he was only 19 when the film was released. He gave an amazing portrayal of a boy who goes in and out of his own world. Juliette Lewis was a quiet storm in this film; she gave Gilbert an anchor of solid acceptance when the pain of his life almost got the best of him. ",/review/rw5748535/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2006,ackstasis,7," A Very Good Film!
","'What's Eating Gilbert Grape,' a film by Lasse Hallstr√∂m, is not your average movie. There are no stunning visual effects, no mind-blowing stunt-work and even the film setting is somewhat dull and lifeless. However, the movie is a very good one, for it is driven by its diverse range of characters.",/review/rw5748535/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2005,saved4eternity,10," Grateful for Gibert Grape!
","A remarkable film that once viewed, will leave an indelible impression on your heart, your mind, your spirit. Set in a run down, going nowhere town, amidst a population of largely rundown, going nowhere people, Gilbert Grape takes us on a journey through the everyday life of one family in which each member is struggling to find his identity. Johnny Depp as Gilbert is at his finest, sensitive and lovingly protective of his mentally challenged younger brother, Arnie, less understanding of the plight of his grossly overweight mother played brilliantly by Darlene Cates. Gilbert just wants a normal life, a life he seems resigned to being deprived of. He seeks solace in the attentions of a wandering housewife played by Mary Steenburgen. Enter Juliette Lewis as Becky, who captures his heart, personifying all the passion for life and freedom of spirit Gilbert aspires to. There are many memorable moments in this film, moments you cannot forget, but suffice it to say, What's Eating Gilbert Grape will leave you feeling grateful for everything you ever took for granted, especially those you love!",/review/rw5748535/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2004,mstorey-1,9," can you believe Leo is not brain damaged?!
","As many have said, the first time I saw this slice of ""unusual"" life film, I was certain that the actor playing Arnie was mentally handicapped. This was the performance to end all. I have been around mentally challenged people who were the carbon copy of the character that Leonardo portrayed. I do no think that anyone else could have pulled this off without looking ridiculous. Our protagonist, Mr. Johnny Depp did his usual amazing work, but it is the performance by Leo that makes this film a must see. I just saw it again tonight, and was blown away again. Acting schools must have copies of this in their files!! Will always be a Leo fan for this one film alone.",/review/rw5748535/?ref_=tt_urv

","""What's eating Gilbert Grape"" is the unique story of a young man who just wants to be a good person. Johnny Depp gives a wonderful performance and Leonardo Dicaprio is amazing, unbelievable, outstanding,... as the retarded Arnie. It's hard to describe his performance, you just have to see it. I think it's one of the best performances of a retarded kid ever. He definitely should have won the Oscar, instead of Tommy Lee Jones. Also Juliette Lewis gives a truly remarkable performance as the vulnerable Becky.",/review/rw5748535/?ref_=tt_urv

9 November 2004,ecopeland22,," a story about a dysfunctional family and how love conquered it
","This film is one of the best I've ever seen. However, as I was once Gilbert, I found little to no comedy. I found the movie to be an excellent portrayal of a torn young man, trying to cope with the hand that had been dealt him. Gilbert was torn between the love for his mother and his anger with her at her condition. He was upset over having to sacrifice what he felt was his own life and goals to care for a family who could not care for themselves. In the end, Gilbert was smarter and more mature than your average kid entering the world as a new adult. And his mother's death taught him that it is okay to be angry about the situation, as long as you learn from it and don't wallow in the self-pity.",/review/rw5748535/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2004,Aaron1375,8," A simple movie with a simple plot.
","Depp plays the title character and this movie just seems to go through a typical few days in this family's life.  However, the main character is getting tired of it, and you can tell he is about to snap.  There isn't a very well defined plot, but it seems to revolve around Arnie's birthday party and the coming of motor homes that drive through the area.  This movie though doesn't revolve around plot, but rather characters.  It is more of a character study I would say.  The performances are rather good so it works for me.  First time I saw this, before I knew who Leonardo was I actually thought he was a mentally ill person playing the part.  This movie has some laughs too as it isn't all serious.  It is worth a look.",/review/rw5748535/?ref_=tt_urv
