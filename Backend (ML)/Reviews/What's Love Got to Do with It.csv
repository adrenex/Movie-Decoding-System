19 November 2021,yusufpiskin,9," Andrew 'The Magnificent' Garfield
","Although everyone knows and admires Andrew Garfield thanks to the big screen, especially Spider-Man, he has always been a theater lover. Garfield becomes a giant in this movie, which combines the theater stage he loves so much with the big screen. If Steven Levenson had watched it, he would have loved this movie and Garfield.",/review/rw7577119/?ref_=tt_urv

6 December 2021,CubsandCulture,9," Garfield makes this film-career best performance
","I am not the biggest fan of Larson. I think RENT (in any form) is a pretty poor musical, regardless of how you look at it. I find the show's treatment of AIDS especially distasteful. Tick, Tick...Boom is a more vivid and authentic work. So this adaptation starts from a better place than the RENT film a few years back. The music and general plot outline is Larson's most engaging work.",/review/rw7577119/?ref_=tt_urv

24 November 2021,Kirpianuscus,," beautiful sketch
","I love Andrew Garfield and this was the main motif, for me, to see this film. And real, he did a great role. And , real, my appreciation for him becomes more intense. And the admiration for great job of Lin Manuel Miranda. The film can be seen as hommage to Jonathan Larson. In same measure, it works very well as nice sketch for many anonimous lives, not very different by the lead character, between love, friendship, self acceptance, ambitious projects and need to be remarked as fair result of not doubts vocation. And a nice kick to they far to have opportunity of courage to become a real name. That last thing , the mix of confrontations, desires and dreams and frustrations , well used, well served represents the great good point of this movie. And, sure, fine exploration of the universe of shows and expressions of pure freedom. It can be perceived as a sketch about truth in its complex nuances , off course, but, in same measure, it is a magnificent musical, impressive not only for familiar ingredients of genre, for admirable energy of Andrew Garfield, for beautiful acting for supporting roles , but for high honesty. It is a very, very, very honest film, thing so rare today. And that transforms it in a personal story, easy as kick to remind the transition from 29 years old to 30, the round crisis, the decision to begin real life. Few scenes in this film are just gorgeous. So, must see it ! Not for be seduced. But for a great, profound useful perspective about life.",/review/rw7577119/?ref_=tt_urv

13 November 2021,marveller-66,8," Andrew Garfield is TERRIFIC!
","Correct me if i'm wrong. I've seen so many actors in their respective movies and also off-screen (i.e., just in interviews, not in flesh), this guy is charming on & off-screen. I mean, his acting is so unique and incredibly realistic. He provides extra details and mentions more than required crew members and respects them. I just hope people would give good reviews for this excellent movie.",/review/rw7577119/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's a great real emotional musical biopic. The story is beautiful, heartbreaking and powerful, it might be hard to follow sometimes, but it will easily move you and you'd definitely relate to eventually.

20 November 2021,Benslie,9," Perfect movie to sing and dance to while thinking about your life so far
","The strongest part about this movie is easily the acting in this movie. All of the actors in this movie brought their all to this movie and helped make the audience feel like a fly on the wall. Honestly, the best performance in this movie was easily Andrew Garfield. He brought so much to this role and it easily blew me away. He easily captivated every emotion from funny to serious and could easily switch between the two. He plays this guy so realistically that I feel like so many people will easily be able to relate to him. The story in this film is also easily relatable for everybody as almost everybody in the world is always worried about how much they've done so far with their lives and if they could've done more in that time. Overall though the story in this movie was captivating from start to end and like I said earlier you feel like a fly on the wall to this guy's story except for one part in this movie the editing. The only part in this movie that really takes you out of the story is the editing in this movie and how it will switch back and forth and just gets annoying. There's also a scene in this movie that just brings the movie to a halt and could've been removed. The Musical numbers in this movie though were definitely the second-best part. It's during these sequences that you can see Lin-Manuel Miranda's directing talent at full capacity. During the movie the directing is alright but during these scenes, you see all the care that went into making them and how much effort was put in. From the choreography to the cinematography the musical numbers fully make this movie a watch. In the end, Tick, Tick... Boom! Is a movie that'll make you think about your life so far while singing and dancing as well.",/review/rw7577119/?ref_=tt_urv

","Beautifully directed and expertly crafted. Tick, Tick...Boom! Soars with a committed and well crafted performance by Andrew Garfield and Robin De Jesús.
